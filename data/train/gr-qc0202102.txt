    "any static black hole ( bh ) arises from the gravitational collapse of some object . under the premises in this work",
    ", the object has not ( yet ) shrinked indefinitely and has not given rise to a spacetime singularity .",
    "it is then natural to consider two regions : one _ exterior _ to the object , and the object _",
    "itself_. the exterior region , as is well known , can be described by a spacetime belonging to the reissner - nordstrm @xcite solution . in the absence of electric or",
    "magnetic charge it is simply schwarzschild s spacetime .",
    "furthermore , one can add a cosmological constant , following recent observational results @xcite .",
    "then , the spacetime belongs to the kottler - trefftz solution family @xcite . in this case , the global properties of the spacetime clearly change , e.g. , the spacetime is no longer asymptotically flat ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "going a step further , we consider the body itself as composed of two main regions .",
    "one is its _ surface _ and the other the rest of the body , i.e. the _ interior _ region .",
    "one may expect that some mechanism having to do e.g. with quantum gravity will be able to stop the collapse of the body .",
    "therefore , we will think of the interior of the body as being described by some spacetime product of the present knowledge available on the merge of quantum field theory and gravitation .",
    "a widely studied issue in this direction is that of quantum vacuum effects @xcite@xcite and the resulting spacetime turns out to be a de sitter ( ds ) or anti de sitter ( ads ) one @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are other alternatives , as e.g. , those of @xcite .    in all these cases considered so far ,",
    "either no distinction has been made between the interior and the exterior of the body ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) or there appears a _ singular _ distribution of matter at the surface of the body ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this distribution is singular in the sense that it is a _ matter surface density _ called _ singular shell_. however , contrary to the case of electromagnetic charge densities , a matter surface density has neither been observed , nor is it predicted by any theory .",
    "it is thus more natural to assume that the matter on the surface of the body is distributed across the body , and leave for a subsequent study the issue of whether this region is thin or thick , in comparison with the region dominated by quantum vacuum effects , through one of the solutions referred to before .",
    "finally , the only work considering _ all _ the features of the structure of a regular static bh with a clear physical source is @xcite .",
    "however , nariai spacetime was absent , as well as an implementation of previous attempts and a complete study of ( local ) energy conditions .",
    "thus , in our opinion , it is worth carrying out a unification of the different results obtained so far , as well as extending them in order to cover some impotant issues that were overlooked in those analysis .",
    "here we provide , for the first time to our knowledge , the general solution of the scheme discussed above .",
    "in particular , we carry out an implementation of all those previous works which , for one or another reason did not comply with all the requirements already specified .",
    "we also perform a study of the local energy conditions in all these cases .    finally , it is also important to introduce other kind of solutions for the interior region , aside from the ones referred to before , which arise from results , or just hints , coming from the contribution of the quantum vacuum to gravity . to summarize , these are the points that will be dealt with , successively , in the body of this paper comprising the next 10 sections .",
    "they are clearly identified by their titles and will need no further specification here .",
    "[ s - fr ] is devoted to some final remarks , and in sect .",
    "[ s - c ] we provide the conclusions of the work .",
    "a brief survey can be found in @xcite .    throughout this work",
    "we will use units such that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , einstein s equations are written in the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the einstein tensor we follow the conventions of @xcite and @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor . a prime will denote derivation with respect to the coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "due to the imposed limitation of non - accepting singular mass shells , the spacetimes describing the interior of the body are not allowed to be of some well known kind as ds or ads spacetimes .",
    "indeed , the interior solution can not be everywhere a spatial isotropic solution , as ds or ads , because this would lead to a sudden change in the pressures exerted by the body to the exterior , and would lead to the appearance of a singular mass shell  @xcite .",
    "now , the type of generalization depends on the underlying physics one is able to assume .",
    "the isotropic case is suitable in order to link it with the expected contributions of a dominating quantum vacuum , especially those associated with vacuum polarization . as we are dealing with spacetimes which are spherically symmetric ,",
    "a natural generalization is to assume that the body may be described by a solution which is _ invariant _ to any non - rotating observer , with a free radial motion , instead of a solution which is invariant to any observer .",
    "this generalization of the energy - matter content of the body is called _ spherically symmetric quantum vacuum _ ( ssqv ) , after @xcite see also @xcite and requires the imposition of @xmath8 , for any non - rotating observer .",
    "this is the type of enery - matter content that is considered in @xcite@xcite and will be the one used in the first part of this work , until we get to sect .",
    "[ s - tmo ] . in particular , ssqvs and non - linear electrodynamics have given some relevant results on the issue of regular bhs , see e.g.  @xcite@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall now characterize the families of spacetimes that are suitable to become ssqvs .",
    "any static , spherically symmetric spacetime can be conveniently described by [ met1 ] ds^2 = -f(r ) dt^2 + f^-1(r ) dr^2 + g^2(r ) d^2 , where @xmath9 .",
    "there are certainly other ways to represent these spacetimes which avoid the problems occurring near the possible horizons or by putting @xmath10 , provided @xmath11 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for a local observer at rest with respect to the coordinate grid of  ( [ met1 ] ) , a standard computation of @xmath6 yields ( @xmath12 is the energy density , @xmath13 the radial pressure and @xmath14 , @xmath15 the tangential pressures , measured by this observer ) [ eq - r ] 8 = 1 g^2 , + [ eq - p ] 8 p = 1 g^2 , + 8 p_2 = 8 p_3 = f  2 + f g",
    " g + f g g. imposing @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - r ] ) ,  ( [ eq - p ] ) , we get f g  = 0 .",
    "we now use that @xmath17 can not be zero in any open region .",
    "two alternatives appear : @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath18 , the expression  ( [ met1 ] ) is useless . it is first necessary to change the coordinate system of  ( [ met1 ] ) by @xmath20 , while keeping the rest unchanged . then one can impose @xmath18 .",
    "the result is [ eq - fn0 ] ds^2 = 2 dt dr + 2 dr^2 + g^2(r ) d^2 . in the orthonormalized cobasis given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ,",
    "the ricci tensor takes the form    ll [ ricci0 ] = & ( - ^0 ^0 + ^0 ^1 + ^1 ^0 - ^1 ^1 ) & +   ( ^2 ^2 + ^3 ^3 ) .    on the other hand , for a ssqv we must have @xmath16 (",
    "the conditions on @xmath6 being directly translated into conditions for @xmath25 ) [ ricci ] = r_00 ( - ^0_n ^0_n + ^1_n ^1_n ) + r_22 ( ^2_n ^2_n + ^3_n ^3_n ) , where @xmath26 is some orthonormalized cobasis , not necessarily coincident with the one used in the computation of  ( [ ricci0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we must look for an orthonormalized cobasis for which the ricci tensor  ( [ ricci0 ] ) becomes of the type  ( [ ricci ] ) .",
    "clearly this is the same as finding out whether we can have linear expressions @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ ricci ] ) is invariant under these changes .",
    "the only solution that makes  ( [ ricci0 ] ) and  ( [ ricci ] ) compatible is then g ",
    "if @xmath30 , we also have @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath19 constitutes the _ proper _ characterization of any possibility .",
    "now , from @xmath19 two distinct alternatives appear g = , g= r + , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constant .",
    "only the latter has been considered in detail in the literature of regular bhs .",
    "we will study it in the sequel .      in order to include the possible horizons , we write the metrics  ( [ met1 ] ) under the common form [ met2 ] ds^2 = - ( 1-h ) dt^2 + 2 h dt dr + ( 1 + h ) dr^2 + ^2 d^2 , + [ met3 ] ds^2 = - ( 1-h ) dt^2 + 2 h dt",
    "dr + ( 1 + h ) dr^2 + r^2 d^2 , where @xmath33 , and the coordinate change is given by @xmath34 .",
    "we will use these forms in the sequel .",
    "we have also used the fact that the case @xmath35 is physically equivalent to the case @xmath36 .",
    "this is intuitively seen because @xmath37 merely represents the scale of units used for @xmath7 and @xmath38 is an arbitrary ( constant ) origin . in terms of coordinate changes",
    "we have : the metric  ( [ met1 ] ) for @xmath39 is @xmath40 . recalling that @xmath41",
    ", one can define a new radial coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "the metric becomes then @xmath43 \\ ,   dt^2 + \\alpha^{-2}f^{-1}[(\\tr - \\gamma)/\\alpha ] \\ , d\\tr^2 + \\tr^2 \\",
    ",   d\\omega^2 $ ] .",
    "now , under a reparametrization of the @xmath44 coordinate by @xmath45 we get @xmath46 \\ , d{\\tilde t}^2 +   \\alpha^{-2}f^{-1}[(\\tr - \\gamma)/\\alpha ] \\ ,",
    "d\\tr^2 + \\tr^2 \\ , d\\omega^2 $ ] . whence one can conclude that any member of  ( [ met1 ] ) with @xmath47 with @xmath48 is equivalent to another member of  ( [ met1 ] ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "since we are studying the general description of ssqvs it is enough to consider the representation @xmath51 , @xmath50 and _ arbitrary _ @xmath52 to include _ any _ case of ssqv .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that  ( [ met3 ] ) can be written in the kerr - schild form @xcite : ds^2 = ds^2 _ + 2 h(r ) , where @xmath53 stands for the flat spacetime metric , @xmath54 is an arbitrary function of @xmath7 and @xmath55 is a geodesic radial null one - form , @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the ssqvs in  ( [ met3 ] ) can be thought as the family of maximal spherically symmetric spacetimes expanded by a geodesic radial null one - form from flat spacetime ( grnss spaces ) .",
    "to summarize , there are _ only _ two non - equivalent families of ssqv .",
    "the case with @xmath57 is characteristic of the nariai solution @xcite .",
    "the nariai solution is a solution of einstein s equations for the same pattern as the de sitter solution , i.e. @xmath58 , being @xmath59 the cosmological constant .",
    "the difference lies in the `` radial '' coordinate . in the nariai case",
    "there is no proper center for the spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , we shall call the spacetimes with @xmath60 generalized nariai metrics .",
    "finally , the other case corresponds to the gnrss which constitute a distinguished family of the class of kerr - schild metrics .",
    "using an orthonormal cobasis defined as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , we see that the riemann tensor has as independent components r_0101 = -h  / 2 , r_2323 = 1 / ^2 .",
    "the ricci tensor is characterized by @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the scalar curvature is @xmath67 , and the einstein tensor has the following non - zero components g_00= - g_11 = 1 / ^2 , g_22 = g_33 = - h ",
    "/ 2 , the isotropic solution the one to be found at the core yields @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrary constants . without losing generality",
    ", we can set @xmath69 , @xmath71 ( as they are clearly gauge freedoms for any spacetime in the family ) .",
    "thanks to the presence of the nariai solution inside this family @xmath72  the factor @xmath73 can be identified with @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the _ only isotropic _ quantum vacuum belonging to this family is the nariai solution .",
    "first we note that these spacetimes fulfill the relation [ pr ] p_2 = --  r 2 . as a consequence , for a regular source @xmath74 as @xmath75",
    "is approached .",
    "therefore , in _ any regular solution _ the spacetime becomes more and more isotropic as @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the contribution from the quantum vacuum becomes more and more dominant as @xmath7 tends to 0 and the initial idea of distributing the singular mass shell across some region of the body is completed .    on the other hand , one can choose a similar cobasis as in the nariai - like case , just replacing @xmath32 by @xmath7 .",
    "the riemann tensor has the following independent components , r_0101 = - h2 , r_0202 = r_0303 = -h 2r ,",
    "r_1212 = r_1313 = h 2r , r_2323 = h r. the ricci tensor for these spacetimes has the following non - zero components @xmath77 $ ] , @xmath78 $ ] . and the scalar curvature is given by @xmath79 . finally , the non - zero components of the einstein s are @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "other expressions that will be used later are [ eqe ] g_00 = - g_11 = 1 r^2 ( h r) , g_22 = g_33 = g_00 - g_00  r 2 .    in this case , the isotropic ( regular ) gnrss is the de sitter solution , given by @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that _ all _ of the possible exterior metrics see sect .",
    "[ s - int] also belong to the gnrss family .",
    "the function @xmath54 is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 stands for the external cosmological constant , @xmath85 is the adm mass of the bh and @xmath86 its electromagnetic charge",
    ".    this coincidence will be very useful in the following section .",
    "the junction , or matching , of two spherically symmetric spacetimes is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the general form of a hypersurface that clearly adjusts itself to the spherical symmetry of any of these spacetimes is as follows : where @xmath87 are the parameters of the hypersurface .",
    "one must thus identify both hypersurfaces in some way .",
    "the identification of @xmath88 with @xmath89 ( 1 and 2 label each of the spacetimes ) is the most natural one , due to the symmetry of the above scheme . in the sequel , 1 labels the exterior spacetime and 2 the interior one .    in order to match the exterior solution with the interior one , one",
    "basically demands the coincidence of the first and second fundamental forms of @xmath90 at each spacetime the other way is to accept the presence of _ singular _ mass shells , which would not require the coincidence of the second fundamental form , but we will dismiss such unphysical option . in order to include the possibility of matching the interior and the exterior at null hypersurfaces ( e.g. at an event horizon ) one can follow the formalism in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that the exterior region is described by a member of the gnrss family .",
    "thus , we have to consider two possibilities : matching a generalized nariai metric with a gnrss one and two gnrss metrics with each other .      in this case",
    "one easily gets @xmath91 const . , @xmath92 const .",
    "see @xcite for full details .",
    "this result tells us that the junction between a generalized nariai spacetime and a member of the gnrss family is impossible .",
    "it would only happen for a ( two - dimensional ) surface .",
    "therefore , _ any _ member of the nariai class _ can not _ be regarded as a good candidate in order to represent the interior structure of a regular , static bh .      in this case one",
    "gets that two members of the gnrss family match with each other if and only if see e.g.  @xcite either @xmath93 const . ,",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 = [ h ' ] = 0     $ ] or @xmath96 const .",
    "the last condition , however , describes the motion of a null hypersurface and is not an acceptable solution in order to describe the _ matter _ inside a static bh .",
    "therefore , we reach the conclusion that : _ the only acceptable hypersurfaces fulfilling the matching conditions , that preserve the spherical symmetry , between two spacetimes of the gnrss family , are those satisfying @xmath97 const . ,",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 = [ h ' ] = 0   $ ] .",
    "_    without losing generality , one can choose @xmath98 , because of the global existence of the killing vector @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , we realize that the chosen coordinates are privileged ones , in which the matching is explicitly @xmath100 .",
    "the hypersurface , @xmath101 , will be timelike , null or spacelike according to @xmath102 , @xmath103 or @xmath104 , respectively .    to summarize , if vacuum polarization is to be the dominant quantum effect , the most simple way to construct a regular bh is to build it upon gnrss spacetimes .",
    "as mentioned elsewhere , the exterior region can appropriately be characterized by a member of the kotller - trefftz class , which is a subclass of the gnrss family .",
    "then , the matching conditions between the exterior and the interior regions are : h_2(r ) = h_1 ( r ) = 2mr -q^2 r^2 + 3 r^2 , + h_2(r ) = h_1(r ) = -2 m r^2 + 2 q^2 r^3 + 23 r. moreover , the aim here is to focus on those interior solutions which are everywhere regular . from the expressions of the riemann tensor and the metric",
    ", one sees that this may only be accomplished if [ eqf ] h_2(0 ) = 0 , h_2(0 ) = 0 .",
    "thus , we finally encounter four conditions in order to have a regular interior solution .    from now on , we will consider @xmath105 to be a smooth function of the variable @xmath106 , a most natural hypothesis in view of the regular character prescribed for the interior solution . in this case ,",
    "the origin conditions tell us that h_2 ( ) = _",
    "n=2^ b_n ^n .",
    "now , one has to impose the two other conditions . obviously it is the same to consider @xmath107 or @xmath108 in the whole procedure .",
    "however , we will first work with @xmath109 in order to implement the junction conditions directly . from the preceding result",
    ", one immediately has h_2 = _",
    "n=0^ a_n ( -1)^n , and the junction conditions tell us that _ 0 = h_1(1 ) = 2mr - q^2 r^2 + 3 r^2 , + a_1 = h_1(1 ) = 2(- m r + q^2 r^2 + 3 r^2 ) , where @xmath110 and a dot denotes derivation with respect to @xmath111 .",
    "the following step is to impose regularity of the solution , eqs .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) .",
    "we get _ n=0^(-1)^n a_n = 0 , _",
    "n=1^(-1)^n n a_n = 0 , which , by virtue of the matching conditions , yield _ n=0^(-1)^n a_n+2 = -4 m r + 3 q^2 r^2 + 3r^2 , + _ n=0^(-1)^n ( n+2 ) a_n+2 = 2 ( -m r + q^2 r^2 + 3r^2 ) .",
    "it is clear that there are infinitely many possible candidates for these interiors .",
    "let us further analyze how they behave near the origin . taking into account the expression of @xmath105 in powers of @xmath112 and using eqs .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) , we get g_11 = -1r^2 _ l=2^ ( l + 1 ) b_l ^l-2 , g_22 = -1r^2 _ l=2^ l + 12b_l ^l-2 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath113 and @xmath114 are different from each other .",
    "yet we have the very relevant property that , for _ any _ of these spacetimes , it holds _ 0 g_11 = _ 0 ( -g_00 ) = _ 0 g_22 = _ 0 g_33 = -3 b_2 r^2 .",
    "whence , we see that a general isotropization of the einstein tensor and consequently of the energy - momentum one _ independent of the model _ is actually accomplished . in terms of @xmath115",
    "we get g_11 = -1r^2 _ m=0^ a_m ^m , + a_m = ( -1)^m ( m+3 ) _ l = m+2^ ( -1)^l l l-2-ma_l , and g_22 = -1r^2 _ m = 0^m+2 2 a_m ^m . so that @xmath116    finally , making no further assumptions on the coefficients of @xmath105 , we can isolate two of them in terms of the rest . for simplicity",
    ", we shall isolate @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the result is @xmath119 with this in hand we can write , respectively , the previous expression for the central value in terms of @xmath115 or @xmath120 , @xmath121 ,    rcl g_11 ( 0 ) = g_22 ( 0 ) & = & - 3 r^2 , + & = & - 3 r^2 .",
    "we will consider six examples .",
    "two constitute the well - known proposals of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two more come from a proposal in @xcite@xcite , for electrically charged bodies , and the proposal given in @xcite , for magnetically charged ones . more specifically",
    ", we will here derive their corresponding analogues , within the present scheme ( what is actually more than simply re - writing those cases ) .",
    "the remaining two examples constitute a family of brand new candidates , which naturally arise from the preceding expressions .",
    "we will start with this last pair .",
    "let us just make the choice that only two specific powers of @xmath122 , say @xmath123 and @xmath124 , be present .",
    "in order to fulfill the regularity conditions , both must satisfy @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "however , if we wish to obtain a de sitter - like behavior at , and near , the origin , we must necessarily impose that one and only one of them , say @xmath125 , be equal to 2 .",
    "thus , @xmath127 reads @xmath128 , for @xmath129 , with , b_2 = 2 m r(n+1 n-2 ) - q^2 r^2(n+2 n-2 ) + r^2 3 , b_n = 2 ( n-2 ) r(-3 m + 2q^2 r ) . @xmath130 and @xmath131 read recall eqs .",
    "( [ eqe]) g_11 ( ) = -+ 6 m r^3 ( n+1 n-2 ) ( ^n-2 - 1 ) + q^2 r^4 , + g_22 ( ) = -+ 6 m r^3 ( n+1n-2 ) ( n 2^n-2 - 1 ) + q^2 r^4 .",
    "whence , one readily sees that their finite value at the origin coincides , as expected , [ eqg0 ] g_11 ( 0 ) = g_22 ( 0 ) = -- 6 m r^3 ( n+1 n-2 ) + 3 q^2 r^4 ( n+2n-2 ) .",
    "this example corresponds to the case in which @xmath105 is a polynomial of lowest degree .",
    "this amounts to setting @xmath132 , @xmath121 , in the general expressions .",
    "its interest lies in its being the simplest possible situation .",
    "the result is h_2 ( ) = ( 8 m r - 5 q^2 r^2 + r^2 3 ) ^2 + ( -6 m r + 4 q^2 r^2 ) ^3 , and g_11 = -24 m r^3 + 15q^2 r^4 - + 8 r^3 ( 3 m - 2 q^2 r ) , + g_22 = - 24 m r^3 + 15 q^2 r^4 - + 12 r^3 ( 3 m - 2 q^2 r ) .",
    "notice that @xmath113 tends to @xmath133 as @xmath111 tends to 1 , the same value as @xmath134 , in accordance with israel s conditions @xcite .      in reference",
    "@xcite see also @xcite a plausible candidate for the energy - matter content of the interiors of regular _ non - charged _ bhs was proposed .",
    "the authors proposed that a singular layer of non - inflationary material should exist between the de sitter core and the external schwarzschild metric .",
    "however the usual spirit of matching a stellar interior with a vacuum exterior was lost , the reason being the unavoidable presence of a singular layer acting as a matter surface density .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite it was argued that their approach could be improved by imposing a smooth transition from the hypersurface to the de sitter core . yet",
    "this step was not implemented . in any case , it was the only available candidate to continue the studies of quantum regular bhs at that time",
    ". the task here will be to see whether this geometrical and physical model can be recovered from our analysis .    in order to to do that ,",
    "we search for a solution within our family which be as close as possible to this particular solution . what amounts to looking for a de sitter core for small values of @xmath111 and a quantum contribution of the type of _ the square of the characteristic curvature of schwarzschild spacetime _ near the matching hypersurface .",
    "these features taken into account , we set for the interior [ eqi ] ( g_00)_int = -(g_11)_int = 1 ( a + b r^3)^2 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are two constants , to be determined . using eqs .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) , we obtain h_2(r ) = r^2 3 a ( a+ b r^3 ) , where we have imposed eqs .",

    "the matching conditions lead to [ eqh ] 1 a(a+br^3 ) = 3 r^2 h_1(r ) , = 3 rh_1(r ) , where @xmath137 comes , as usual , from the external model .    in the exterior region , close to the matching hypersurface , the quantum contributions do not turn into a cosmological - like term .",
    "they are of the form @xmath138 , as mentioned before .",
    "we thus have a quantum exterior which is different from the one encountered in the rest of the examples and sections before , which can not be described by a member of the kottler - trefftz class .",
    "fortunately , our preceding results are still useful .",

( 30 ) in @xcite and comparing it with our result g_00 = -1 + h_2 , we realize that , substituting here our corresponding @xmath105 for that model , these expressions turn out to be very similar , except for a possible overall sign difference , due to the different signatures ( e.g. ( + , ,, ) instead of our ( ,+,+,+ ) ) .",
    "we conclude that the same structure for the horizons and cauchy hypersurfaces is obtained . in @xcite ,",
    "the solutions are obtained by approximations of the exact solution , so that these results and ours are really coincident ( the relative error with respect to both exact solutions being completely negligible ) .    in general , the horizons result from the cancellation of @xmath204 .",

    "the main point is here , in fact , that the matching occurs at a radius which is substantially smaller than the schwarzschild radius of the object .",
    "therefore we will always have a typical exterior , a vacuum transition region extending until the matching with the object happens , and a quantum - dominated interior , which finally converges to a de sitter core . in the vacuum interior region and in some part of the quantum object ,",
    "the role of @xmath44 and @xmath7 are not interpreted as usual ( @xmath205 changes its character ) .",
    "this is the reason for adequately treating the horizons : to see where exactly such changes appear .",
    "but , we can still perfectly agree in ordinary physical terms without requiring a general determination of the precise radii at which horizons occur .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors studied the stability of the model .",
    "the same considerations there hold for our whole family of solutions , as can be easily seen after a careful analysis .",

    "its general structure can be found in @xcite for the case where the sources satisfy weak energy conditions ( see next section ) .",
    "there , it was shown that the topology of any regular bh , satisfying the weak energy conditions , should be similar to that of a singularity - free reissner - nordstrm spacetime",
    ". however , there are relevant solutions in our family that violate the weak energy conditions ( wec )",
    ". it would be worth studying what happens in those cases .",
    "a common point when dealing with the avoidance of singularities is to show that the energy conditions required in the singularity theorems ( see e.g. @xcite ) fail to be valid .    here",

    "this adds a new ( elementary ) example to the violation of wec when quantum effects play an important role ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and shows clearly that , although energy conditions do help understanding the models , they should not necessarily restrict the search for new solutions ( fig .",

    "one may ask whether this is too odd or easy . since one expects @xmath226 , we readily get @xmath270 .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath124 must be bigger than 2 ( in order to be singularity - free ) , implies that , in practice , dec are violated in these models recall wec are satisfied _",

    "[ ss - tao ] , we can assume @xmath136 , @xmath271 to be positive ( for , if @xmath272 one gets a negative schwarzschild s mass outside the body and if @xmath273 , @xmath274 can be substituted by @xmath275 ) .",
    "following a similar analysis as with the previous models , one gets that dec are satisfied for @xmath276 , where @xmath277 .",

    "a more definite answer can only be provided after a particular field model is chosen , what will yield a particular value of @xmath142 .",
    "what is this plausible field model remains , as of now , unknown .",

    "[ ss - dym ] ) , it is easy to show that dec are satisfied throughout the source if @xmath287 , as expected .",

    "it is to be noticed that dec give a new input to understand the models .",
    "( the case @xmath288 also satisfies dec , whereas the rest of possibilities violates them ) .",

    "some concluding remarks are in order .",
    "first , although dec are known to be different from wec , here we see more : it turns out that in cases with @xmath289 , dec are _ more restrictive _ than wec .",
    "another consequence is that dec violation and the spacetime region where it occurs are not related .",
    "that is , dec may be violated in regions where @xmath290 is larger or smaller than 1 .",
    "it happens , however , that after substituting expected numerical values for the physical parameters involved , the values of @xmath290 where dec is violated belong mainly in the region where @xmath291 and a `` signature change in spacetime has occured '' .",
    "the region with @xmath292 is then at planckian ( regularization ) scales and can thus be forgotten . on the other hand , when wec are violated , one usually accepts that the energy - matter content of the model can no longer be described by a classical matter source model .",
    "however , dec deserve some especial attention .",
    "these remarks impel us to further interprete the violation of dec from the causal interpretation of dec @xcite .",
    "a possibility is that the breakdown of causality in matter interaction may be interpreted in similar though properly adapted terms as is the einstein - podolski - rosen paradox interpreted in quantum mechanics .",
    "if this is so , or something similar can be proven , dec may be a more natural sign of quantum effects in matter than wec , for the case of positive densities .",
    "this point deserves further investigation .",
    "we will now analyze the main features arising when one replaces the de sitter core by a different spherically symmetric solution .",
    "in previous sections we have worked with the assumption that the energy - momentum tensor satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "now we would like to make the first steps towards the general case where @xmath293 and @xmath294 may be independent of each other .",
    "therefore , our aim here is to match two spacetimes that share the existence of an integrable killing field and spherical symmetry . in order to get the most natural junction",
    ", we need to take profit of both symmetries exhaustively .",

    "spherical symmetry has thus been completely used .",
    "we now extract consequences from the presence of @xmath296 .",
    "the natural thing to do is to identify both vector fields , i.e. @xmath301 .",

    "finally , notice that the first condition on @xmath332 is nothing but the requirement of the mass function to be continuous across the hypersurface , while the second one is related with the continuity of the radial stress , or pressure ( see e.g.  ( [ eq - p ] ) ) .",

    "there are also other objects of interest , such as black strings , higher dimensional black holes , etc . in all cases ,",
    "one looks for a correspondence principle with general relativistic black holes .",
    "this transition is usually reflected in the strength of the coupling constant , or the entropy ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we take a complementary viewpoint .",
    "the most interesting case to our aims is that of a self - gravitating string ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however the necessary ingredients specially the corresponding spacetime metric in order to tackle this problem are still under study . here",
    "we will consider the most simple ( and widely considered ) case , that of a supersymmetric back hole .",
    "a family of such black holes , related with electrically charged black holes , is given by ( see @xcite for details ) ds^2 = - f^-1/2(r ) ( 1 - r_0 r ) dt^2 + f^1/2(r ) , where @xmath333 $ ] , and where the @xmath334 are related with the integer charges of the d - branes being used .",

    "$ ] , the above conditions yield @xmath150 as a function of six of the seven parameters , @xmath345 .",
    "detailed analysis shows that these conditions are easily fulfilled when @xmath346 , @xmath347 , with @xmath348 fixed .",
    "the resulting @xmath150 is very close to @xmath349 , i.e. the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "we remark that @xmath350 is the radial coordinate which has a direct interpretation in terms of the `` size '' of the object , and not @xmath7 alone .",
    "all this being in complete agreement with the expected transitions for extreme , and nearly extreme , supersymmetric black holes .",
    "the same idea should be extended to self - gravitating strings when their ( 4-dimensional ) spacetime metric is obtained .",
    "for instance , the expected order of magnitude of @xmath150 found in @xcite , should be recovered .",
    "this issue will be the matter of subsequent research .",
    "the first thing to be noticed is the intrinsic freedom present in our model , which is as large as the measure of the set of analytic functions of one variable .",
    "this is a very rewarding feature , since it allows to impose further restrictions coming from new , more accurate proposals . in particular",
    ", it will be a helpful tool when trying to find explicitly a quantum field responsible for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the fundamental uncharged case . for comparison , in all previous works , based on individual models ,",
    "the prospective of finding a quantum field related with their energy - matter content was hopeless . to that end",
    ", we would like to draw the attention to @xcite , where a useful framework to deal with the interior region is given .    in the charged case ,",
    "let us notice that any gnrss spacetime can be linked with a solution to ned ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the case of schwarzschild solution is a solution with zero charge and reissner - nordstrm one , the only one which is linear , i.e. , maxwellian .",
    "therefore , the _ whole _ family of gnrss metrics has indeed an immediate interpretation in terms of a field theory which is well established when the object is electrically or magnetically charged .",
    "this is another useful result .",
    "a carefull study of this fact will be reported elsewhere .    finally , one can free the requirement that there must be an event horizon .",
    "the objects would then become  visible \" and the study of the entropy of the solutions as well as their associated hawking temperature would bring some clues on the time evolution of ( classically ) static black holes .",
    "in this work we have investigated , under quite general conditions , the question of using einstein s theory of gravitation extended to include semiclassical effects with the purpose to constraint the physical structure of the emerging spacetime solutions that might be suitable for the description of the interiors of non - rotating black holes .    in the first part of the work we have exploited the idea that vacuum polarization may indeed play an essential role in the interior region .",
    "we have obtained the result that only two families fulfill the imposed requirement and , moreover , we have shown that _ only one _ of them is suitable for representing static black hole interiors , what is certainly a most remarkable result .",
    "then we have turned our attention to other sources for the core .",
    "given that a promising alternative self - gravitating strings needs still to be studied in more detail , we have started this program by first giving the general conditions to be fulfilled by any spacetime with spherical symmetry and having some static region .",
    "finally , we have applied the results obtained to a supersymmetric black hole , as a preliminar case .",
    "we have seen that , in such situation , the matching is generically compatible , including the case of extreme black holes .",
    "this last setting is precisely the same for which the correspondence between semiclassical black holes and stringy ones has been recently confirmed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , our overall conclusion is the following .",
    "first , the results in the first sections have opened a new window for the search of a compatible quantum field that , once regularized , may yield the same result for , at least , a particular energy - momentum tensor inside the general family of models considered ( for instance within ned , see also @xcite ) .",
    "second , once a corresponding einsteinian metric associated with a quantum model is known , the scheme developed here has been proven to be well suited to check the consistency of the involved physical parameters and even , in some cases , to assign explicit values to them .",
