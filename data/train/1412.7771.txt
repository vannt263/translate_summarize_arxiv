    "the expectation is universal thermodynamic properties , identical for all systems belonging to such a class of systems @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", i proposed that this unitary thermodynamics is a good candidate for evaluation by thermodynamic metric geometry , related to ideas from critical phenomena .",
    "the result is a full thermodynamic fundamental equation for all of the thermodynamic properties .",
    "this local density approximation ( lda ) contains a few undetermined parameters that may be determined from fits to available experimental data .",
    "previously @xcite , i analyzed thermodynamic data for the total entropy and the total energy taken at duke university in a nonhomogeneous trapped system @xcite .",
    "a complication in analyzing this data was that trap integration of the theoretical lda was required to compare with experiment .    in this paper ,",
    "i fit a somewhat modified version of this thermodynamic geometric lda to a more recent experiment , at mit @xcite , which measured local thermodynamic properties , and that required no trap integration of the theory for comparison .",
    "in addition , i trap integrated my resulting fit to the mit data to compare with the earlier duke experiment @xcite , and this comparison has led to a recommendation for the best overall fit .",
    "this best overall fit agrees with the mit data sets with a value of @xmath22 of about @xmath23 , and with the duke data with @xmath22 of about @xmath24 .",
    "i also include three appendices : appendix a presents the series solution for @xmath25 , appendix b presents a virial expansion solution , and appendix c gives an explicit formula for the best overall fit , and for a number of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in this section , i summarize the general theory , omitting some details found in the first paper @xcite .",
    "the application of statistical mechanics to unitary thermodynamics runs into difficulties on two points .",
    "first , even if the interaction potential between atoms were exactly known , the calculation of the partition function @xmath26 would be very difficult .",
    "strong interactions typically produce substantial organized fluctuating structures containing many particles .",
    "these mesoscopic structures , of size the correlation length @xmath27 , do not lend themselves to familiar approximation schemes such as mean field theory .",
    "second , even if we could somehow overcome these obstacles for some given system , establishing universality is awkward , since the calculation would have to be repeated for a set of systems , all presumably in the same universality class , to demonstrate equivalence .",
    "a thermodynamic approach offers another way to address such problems .",
    "thermodynamics requires no specific input of an interparticle interaction potential .",
    "in addition , large organized fluctuating mesoscopic structures are conceptually an advantage , since thermodynamic averages improve with the addition of particles",
    ". however , to exploit such possible thermodynamic advantages requires special thermodynamic tools for dealing with mesoscopic fluctuating structures .",
    "the first such tool is the thermodynamic curvature @xmath28 , that in cases where @xmath27 encompasses a number of particles , is the correlation volume : @xmath29 .",
    "( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the second tool is hyperscaling from the theory of critical phenomena @xcite , which has free energy per volume @xmath30 . eliminating the common @xmath31 yields the geometric equation    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "this geometric equation constitutes a third - order partial differential equation for @xmath34 . in applications",
    "so far , however , a scaling assumption of some form was used to express the geometric equation as an ordinary differential equation for a single function .",
    "this ordinary differential equation may be solved , subject to background subtraction , boundary conditions , and assumptions about analyticity .",
    "the basic calculation scheme is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in contrast to statistical mechanics , which builds up from the microscopic level to the macroscopic level by calculating the partition function @xmath26 , the thermodynamic approach is based on the interplay between the macroscopic and the mesoscopic levels .",
    "the thermodynamic method thus lacks full microscopic information , and certainly can not hope to encompass all the problems accessible to statistical mechanics .",
    "however , in cases with strong interactions , characterized by universal behavior , the thermodynamic method may offer significant advantages .     from the quantum energy levels @xmath35 and the temperature @xmath36 .",
    "but this direct calculation method is difficult to implement in the presence of strong interparticle interactions .",
    "instead , i suggest a thermodynamic calculation method based on the interplay with mesoscopic structures of characteristic size @xmath27 , and employing the thermodynamic curvature @xmath28 and the free energy per volume @xmath34 .",
    "this calculation method highlights universal properties.,width=384 ]      callen @xcite showed that the thermodynamic formalism may be applied in several forms , all corresponding to the same physical results . in the previous paper @xcite i started from the fundamental equation for the internal energy :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the entropy , particle number , and volume , respectively .",
    "also , let @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denote the temperature , chemical potential , and pressure , respectively .",
    "here , the comma notation indicates differentiation . in unitary thermodynamics , we use the scaled form :    @xmath44 , \\label{30}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants , and @xmath47 is a function of a single variable . for the three - dimensional problem ,",

    "this scaled form for the energy considerably simplifies the solution of the geometric equation eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamic geometric theory is based around two singular points , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath58 , where @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "i solved for @xmath3 about both singular points , and joined the solutions at @xmath4 .",
    "this joining can not be continuous in all the thermodynamic quantities , and i joined to get a second - order phase transition at @xmath62 .",
    "a joining corresponding to a first - order phase transition was also possible , but since the mit group @xcite featured a second - order phase transition in their analysis , i did likewise .",
    "the result was two functional branches @xmath63 for @xmath5 , and @xmath25 for @xmath6 .",
    "the small @xmath7 , or `` superfluid '' , function @xmath63 was found in the first paper @xcite , and for @xmath7 near zero takes the form of a puisseux series :    @xmath64    here , @xmath9 is a constant exponent , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , are series coefficients .",

    ", i tried a puisseux series solution as well for @xmath25 for large @xmath7 , and this proved effective for trap integrating to fit the duke experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the mit experiment @xcite has smaller error bars and considerably more data for higher @xmath7 , and a puisseux series for @xmath25 will not produce an acceptable fit .",

    "a second - order phase transition requires , in addition , continuous @xmath80 and @xmath7 .",
    "as was shown in the first paper @xcite , these continuity conditions lead to :    @xmath81    and    @xmath82    in my approach , neither @xmath63 nor @xmath25 show any singular behavior at @xmath62 .",
    "hence , this second - order phase transition corresponds to a pure ehrenfest phase transition , with discontinuities but no infinities in the second derivative of @xmath3 .",
    "it is generally thought that the phase transition in unitary thermodynamics is second - order @xcite , and in the 3d xy universality class @xcite .",
    "systems in the 3d xy universality class are not thought to have infinities in their response functions , consistent with the picture developed in this paper .",
    "the mit experiment @xcite also does not show apparent singular behavior in the response functions , though singular behavior could conceivably be rounded off by the finite resolution of the imaging system .",
    "in this section , i discuss the fitting of the thermodynamic geometric theory to experiment .",
