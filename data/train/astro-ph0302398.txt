    "as part of a study of proto - planetary nebulae and young planetary nebulae we have observed 59 objects that have been selected for fulfilling one or more of the following criteria : post - agb stars with evidence of high mass loss rate , or pne with low degree of ionization or with h@xmath1 , co or oh molecular emission ; all the objects observed have iras colors typical of planetary nebulae . in the sample , 13 objects were outstanding for exhibiting extremely broad h@xmath0 lines , of these , 10 have not been reported previously as having this characteristic .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles selected for being extremely broadened are presented in this work .",
    "very wide h@xmath0 emission lines have been reported previously in other objects in the early stages of planetary nebulae phase ; these include seven post - agb stars , five young pne and some symbiotic stars ( van de steene , wood & van hoof 2000 ; lee 2000 ; lee & hyung 2000 ; miranda , torrelles & eiroa 1996 ; balick 1989 ; lpez & meaburn 1983 ; van winckel , duerbeck & schwarz 1993 ; wallerstein 1978 ) .",
    "lee & hyung ( 2000 ) advanced the proposal that the broad wings are produced by rayleigh - raman scattering which involves atomic hydrogen , whereby ly@xmath0 photons with a velocity width of a few @xmath2 @xmath3 are converted to optical photons and fill the h@xmath0 broad region . in the present work",
    "this mechanism is investigated further and alternate possibilities for h@xmath0 broadening are examined .",
    "the observations were carried out at the observatorio astronmico nacional in san pedro mrtir , baja california with the 2.1-m telescope and the reosc echelle spectrograph ( r @xmath4 18,000 at 5,000  ) and a 1024@xmath51024 tektronix detector that yields a spectral resolution of 10.6 and a spatial resolution of 0.99  per pixel .",
    "the 3600 to 6800  range was covered in 29 orders . for extended objects",
    "the slit was centered on the nucleus .",
    "the observing log of those objects with wide h@xmath0 wings is presented in table [ tlog ] .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with iraf routines using ` echelle ' and ` ccdred ' tasks .",
    "calibrated spectra for most of the objects were obtained .",
    "the orders were extracted using a 10 pixel window . a hear lamp was used for wavelength calibration and the standard stars by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were observed for the flux calibration .    in several cases",
    "the objects exhibit extremely wide h@xmath0 lines , with full widths at zero intensity , fwzi , larger than 800 @xmath3 . in order to ascertain whether the wide wings are real or due to instrumental effects",
    "the `` number of counts at maximum '' vs. fwzi both for the brightest unsaturated lines of the comparison lamp spectra and for h@xmath0 emission lines in our sample were compared .",
    "objects with with fwzi @xmath6  1000 @xmath3  and those with significantly broader wings in h@xmath0 than what can be considered instrumental were selected for this study ; namely , those with fwzi 3@xmath7 above the observed ones for comparable line intensities in the hear lamp .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles for the 13 selected objects are shown on figure [ plotone ] . to better visualize the line profiles ,",
    "an enlargement along the intensity to display the wings over the full h@xmath0 profile is presented . in all cases",
    "the fwzi is significantly larger than expected from a gaussian fit to the core of the profile .",
    "no correlation between the line intensity and the width of the wings was found .",
    "the main spectral characteristics of each object are presented in table [ tcarace ] .",
    "it includes the ions present in emission and absorption in our spectra and the stellar spectral type ( as taken from simbad database ) .",
    "for the 13 objects h@xmath0 fwzi and h@xmath8 fwzi where it is significantly larger than expected from a gaussian fit to the core of the profile are presented in table [ tcaracg ] . in this table the most common classification in the literature for each object , nebular morphology , possible binarity and type of h@xmath0 line profile are included .",
    "for this case maximum velocity would correspond to the circular velocities at the surface of the exciting star , @xmath9 which for young pne central stars of @xmath10 m@xmath11 , and @xmath12 r@xmath11 would correspond to @xmath13 @xmath3 , although for symbiotic stars , where the hot component is small @xmath14 r@xmath11 , larger velocities could be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , for both pne and symbiotic stars , @xmath15 is not large enough to explain the observed broadening which reaches up to 5000 @xmath3  in some cases",
    ". thus the possibility that in pne emission from a rotating disk would explain by itself the extended wings can be ruled out .      the possibility for the line wings to be formed in the region dominated by stellar winds was tested by examining the existing iue spectra for each object looking for evidence of p  cyg profiles in resonant lines of ions like , , , , and .",
    "only one object ( iras  20462 + 3416 ) shows p  cyg profile evidence both in our optical spectra and in the uv . furthermore , iras  20462 + 3416 shows an anomalous broadened emission in h@xmath0 , that is + 110 @xmath3 from the narrow emission line .",
    "this profile shows significant deviations from the @xmath16 profile that can be fit to the other broad wings ( see figure [ plotone ] ) .",
    "the presence of p  cyg profiles both in optical and uv spectra , and the h@xmath0 wing profile suggests that stellar wind is the mechanism that is producing these features . in a separate paper ( arrieta , torres - peimbert , georgiev & koenigsberger 2003 )",
    "it is shown that indeed the h@xmath0 profile of this object can be explained by a very strong stellar wind .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles for the rest of the objects can not be explained with stellar winds .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed , and has been intensively studied , as the line broadening mechanism in qsos ( e.g. mathis 1970 ; shields & mckee 1981 ; lee 1999 ) and in wrs ( e.g. hillier 1991 ) .",
    "given that the cross section of electron scattering is independent of wavelength it is to be expected that other intense emission lines formed in the same region as h@xmath0 are similarly broad .",
    "extended wings in other bright emission lines of our optical spectra were searched for .",
    "no broad extensions in forbidden lines in any of the objects were found .",
    "the objects irc+10420 , m  1 - 92 , hm  sge , m  3 - 60 , and z  and showed extended wings in h@xmath8 . in all cases the width of h@xmath8 is significantly smaller than that of h@xmath0 ( see table [ tcaracg ] ) .",
    "it is possible that in the other objects the low signal - to - noise ratio masks the low intensity extended wings . for objects with broad h@xmath8 wings",
    "no correlations were found with the presence of the h@xmath8 wings and the width of h@xmath0 , nor with the h@xmath0/h@xmath8 line ratios .",
    "the necessary conditions for the h@xmath0 wings to be produced by electron scattering were investigated . given that no significant broadening was found in the forbidden lines , it is required for the forbidden line region to be exterior to the electron scattering region .",
    "a two - region geometry was assumed : ( a ) a recombination line emitting region where a substantial fraction of h@xmath0 is produced , dense enough to suppress the forbidden lines , and where most of the scattering takes place ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) ( b ) and an external low density forbidden line emitting region ( @xmath19  @xmath20 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider that region ( a ) consists of a point source where most of the h@xmath0 is produced surrounded by a dense scattering region .    to derive the temperature in the electron scattering region from the observed h@xmath0 line profiles the treatment proposed by mathis ( 1970 )",
    "was followed .",
    "the main parameter is the width of the wings , defined as @xmath21 , which essentially determines the temperature of the electron scattering region , @xmath22 .",
    "the optical depth of the scattering region , @xmath23 , can be derived from the ratio of the strength of the unscattered core of the line relative to its total strength @xmath24 , which determines the optical depth of the scattering region , @xmath23 ( osterbrock 1980 ) . for the simple case of a spherically symmetric scattering region of uniform density and temperature for the case of m2 - 9 @xmath25 , and @xmath26",
    "can be obtained . from these values a temperature , @xmath27 k , and optical depth , @xmath28 can be found , the latter coupled to a limiting size of @xmath29 cm , given by an unresolved central core of 2 , yields a density @xmath30 @xmath20 for the electron - scattering region . from the values derived for m  2 - 9 , which is representative of the whole sample , it was considered unlikely for this configuration to be the general case surrounding an agb star and thus to account for the extremely wide h@xmath0 lines observed in young pne .",
    "raman scattering describes the absorption of a photon , followed by the immediate re - emission of another photon at different wavelength where the intermediate state does not correspond to a true bound state of the atom .",
    "initially this process was suggested by schmid ( 1989 ) as the mechanism of production of the broad emission features at @xmath316830 and 7088  found in 50% of symbiotic stars ; he suggested that the emission features are due to raman scattering of the resonance doublet @xmath32 1032 and 1038  by neutral hydrogen .",
    "nussbaumer , schmid & vogel ( 1989 ) proposed a list of uv lines of different ions ( including , , , and ) , with wavelengths close to ly@xmath8 , as candidates for raman scattering on the ground state of neutral hydrogen ; these raman scattered lines would be expected to be found in the 6000 - 7000  , range .",
    "they noted the possibility that raman scattering may also hold a clue to the broad line wings of h@xmath0 , occasionally observed in seyfert galaxies and symbiotic stars .",
    "several of the emission features at different wavelengths that can be attributed to raman scattering have been identified in symbiotic stars and in planetary nebulae . in symbiotic stars",
    "the identifications include , among others : @xmath326830 , 7088  from @xmath321032   and @xmath327021 , 7052   from @xmath321036 , 1037   in v1016 cyg ( schmid 1989 ; schild & schmid 1996 ) as well as @xmath334850   from ( 2 - 8 ) @xmath33972.1 , @xmath334331 from ( 2 - 10)@xmath33949.3 , and @xmath334975  from @xmath33977.0 in rr tel ( van groningen 1993 ) . in planetary nebulae , they include @xmath334850  in ngc 7027 ( pquignot et al . 1997 ) , and @xmath336545  from ( 2 - 6 ) @xmath331025   in m2 - 9 ( lee et al . 2001 ) .",
    "lee & hyung ( 2000 ) proposed that the broad h@xmath0 wings of the pn ic  4997 are formed through raman scattering that involves atomic hydrogen and , by which ly@xmath8 photons with a velocity width of a few 10@xmath34 @xmath3  are converted to optical photons and fill the h@xmath0 broad wing region .",
    "their model fits the observations on the blue wing from @xmath35 = 500 to 1500 @xmath3 , it requires relatively strong incident ly@xmath8 flux from an unresolved core of high density ( @xmath36 @xmath20 ) and a column density for the scattering region of @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "lee ( 2000 ) further proposed that the h@xmath0 wings seen in symbiotic stars can be fit to raman scattered profiles . for the optically thin case , where almost all the ly@xmath8 photons are scattered not more than once and assuming a flat incident ly@xmath8 profile , to the first order the wing profile can be approximated by a curve proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "lee adjusted this curve to h@xmath0 profile observations from 200 to 1000 from the line center for 16 symbiotic stars .",
    "figure [ plotone ] shows the fit of curves proportional to @xmath40 to the wings of the 13 objects under consideration in this paper . in general",
    "the fits are satisfactory for 12 objects , excepting iras 20462 + 3416 where it does not at all fit the observed profile ; the curves match the observations starting at 200 - 300 @xmath3  from the center of the line , to the outermost regions where the signal becomes too faint to be significant , this extreme velocity reaches up to 500 - 1500 @xmath3 .",
    "the differences in some objects can be explained in terms of non uniform motions in the ionized regions .",
    "the kinematics of these cases will be analyzed in later studies .",
    "in particular , crl 618 and hm sge show wider cores than the expected profile , while irc+10420 shows a narrower core ; m1 - 92 shows significant differences in the 300 - 800  region , which have been interpreted as a jet of material along the line of sight ( arrieta , torres - peimbert , & georgiev 2000 ) .",
    "the case of iras  20462 + 3416 is clearly different , because it does not fit at all such a @xmath39 profile , neither in the core , nor in the wings .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section the interpretation of this profile corresponds to a very large mass loss rate ( arrieta , torres - peimbert , georgiev & koenigsberger 2003 ) .",
    "the width required for ly@xmath8 emission to be responsible for the h@xmath0 wings has been investigated in more detail .",
    "since the width of the scattered h@xmath0 is proportional to the initial width of the ly@xmath8 line , then , @xmath41 is expected .",
    "an estimate of the ly@xmath8 width can be given by other uv emission lines widths .",
    "a search in the uv high resolution spectra of mast ( multimission archive at space telescope ) was carried out for the objects under consideration where data for z  and , hm  sge and ic  4997 were found . in the cases of z  and and hm  sge the ] @xmath331892  line has width of @xmath42 , consistent with the @xmath43 width ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) required to produce the observed broadened h@xmath0 lines ( as given in table [ tcaracg ] ) . in the case of ic  4997",
    "the width of the ] @xmath331892  line is of only @xmath46 . although lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) consider that since the ly@xmath8 underlying continuum emission is not likely to show a flat profile , it may be more plausible that the broad h@xmath0 wings are formed by raman scattering of the continuum photons around ly@xmath8 .",
    "evidence of additional raman scattered features in our optical spectra was searched for .",
    "the @xmath336830  feature was found to be present in z  and and weakly in hm  sge with a fwzi @xmath471500 @xmath3(this feature has been studied previously by birriel et al .",
    "1998 ; schmid et al .",
    "2000 ) . features around this wavelength were found in m  2 - 9 , iras  17395 - 0841 , irc+10420 , m  3 - 60 , ic  4997 and possibly in m  1 - 92 with fwzi around a few 10@xmath34 and not a few 10@xmath48 as is the case in symbiotic stars . the @xmath336545  feature in m  2 - 9 and m  1 - 92 as well as @xmath334851  in ic  4997 with fwzi around few 10@xmath34 of",
    "were also found . in that same sense , the h@xmath8 wings found in irc+10420 , m  1 - 91 , hm  sge , m3 - 60",
    ", hb  12 and z  and ( see table 3 ) can be explained by raman scattering of the ly@xmath49 line by the neutral hydrogen component .    in order to obtain additional indicators of the presence of neutral or molecular material along the line of sight a search in the literature",
    "was carried out for data on 21-cm measurements and the column density of atomic hydrogen . only in the symbiotic star hm  sge and the planetary nebula ic",
    "4997 21-cm column densities have been measured ; in both cases values of @xmath50 @xmath38 were determined . also , following dinerstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , evidence of nebular doublet @xmath325889 , 5895 from our optical spectra was looked for , where nebular components in 11 of our 13 objects were found ; those with bright optical continuum and favorable radial velocities , ( objects with radial velocities well separated from those expected for the interstellar material ) which allow the separation of the nebular component and the narrow interstellar one . in addition a search in the literature for co rotational transitions in radio wavelengths , roto - vibrational ones in the near infrared and h@xmath1 roto - vibrational transitions",
    "was performed .",
    "the results are given in table [ tneutra ] where evidence of a neutral component at least in one of the indicators is listed .",
    "we confirm that raman scattering is the most probable mechanism for the formation of the h@xmath0 broad wings in 12 of the 13 objects under consideration .",
    "this is supported by a fit of the profile to a @xmath51 law , by the presence of raman produced features in emission , and by additional indicators of the presence of a significant neutral hydrogen component .",
    "evidence of neutral components in other 29 objects observed with h@xmath0 in emission was searched for , in order to compare with the sample presented here .",
    "however there was not enough information in the literature to derive significant statistical data between the objects that show extreme wing widening and those that do not show it . only in the case of the hydrogen molecule",
    "it was found that those objects with broad h@xmath0 wings have h@xmath1 , while those that are not broadened , do not .",
    "most of the objects with broad lines seem to have common characteristics : bipolar morphology , and composite emission line profiles , furthermore , they are compact objects in the process of forming a planetary nebula and very probably they are sites of wind interaction .",
    "more detailed studies of the conditions for raman scattering to take place and thus for the presence of surrounding neutral hydrogen could give us information about the processes that take place in giving rise to bipolar planetary nebulae .",
