    "all material objects , even if charge neutral , support instantaneous current fluctuations due to quantum and thermal fluctuations of their charge distribution .",
    "the interaction that results from the electromagnetic coupling of these currents on different objects is usually called the casimir force .",
    "originally , this force has been derived for two parallel perfect metal plates @xcite and atoms @xcite , and generalized later to two infinite dielectric half - spaces with planar and parallel surfaces @xcite .",
    "the non - additivity of the casimir force limits these results in their applicability to objects at very short separation via the so - called proximity force approximation which provides only an uncontrolled approximation of surface curvature to lowest order at vanishingly small separations and ignores the global geometrical arrangement of the objects .",
    "generically , one encounters in practice geometries and shapes that are rather distinct from infinite , parallel and planar surfaces .",
    "hence one faces the problem to compute the casimir force between objects of general shape , arrangement and material decomposition .",
    "this article summarizes recent progress that has been proofed useful in solving this problem for a variety of geometries .",
    "( for an overview of the development of related approaches , see ref . .",
    ") in order to study casimir forces in more general geometries , it turns out to be advantageous to describe how fluctuating currents are induced on the objects by the scattering of electromagnetic waves .",
    "this representation of the casimir interaction was developed in refs .  .",
    "each object is characterized by its on - shell electromagnetic scattering amplitude . the separations and orientations of the objects are encoded in universal translation matrices , which describe how a solution to the source - free maxwell s equations in the basis appropriate to one object looks when expanded in the basis appropriate to another .",
    "these matrices hence describe the electrodynamic interaction of the multipole moments associated with the currents and depend on the displacement and orientation of coordinate systems , but not on the shape and material of the objects themselves .",
    "the scattering amplitudes and translation matrices are then combined in a simple formula that allows efficient numerical and , in some cases , analytical calculations of casimir forces and torques for a wide variety of geometries , materials , and external conditions .",
    "the approach applies to any finite number of arbitrarily shaped objects with arbitrary linear electromagnetic response at zero or finite temperature .    to illustrate this general formulation , we provide some sample applications , including results for the interaction between metallic objects for two spheres and for a sphere and a plane , taking into account the combined effect of shape and material properties at large distances .",
    "in addition , we provide examples for the non - additivity of the interaction by considering three objects ( two spheres and a plane ) and for the orientation dependence in the case of spheroids . the results are presented in form of analytical expressions at large distances and as numerical results at smaller separations .",
    "we consider the casimir energy for neutral objects with electric and magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "the partition function @xmath0 is defined through the path integral , which sums all configurations of the electromagnetic field ( outside and inside the objects ) with periodic boundary conditions in time between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the free energy @xmath3 of the field at inverse temperature @xmath4 is @xmath5 the unrenormalized free energy generally depends on the ultraviolet cutoff , but cutoff - dependent contributions arise from the objects individually and do not depend on their separations or orientations . since we are only interested in energy differences , we can remove these divergences by subtracting the energy of the system when the objects are in some reference configuration , see below . by replacing the time @xmath2 by @xmath6",

    "this sum must be restricted by a choice of gauge , so that it does not include the infinitely redundant gauge orbits . we will choose to work in the gauge @xmath8 , although of course no physical results depend on this choice .",

    "the function @xmath235 can be expanded into spherical harmonics @xmath236 , and spheroidal symmetry can be mimicked by choosing @xmath237 .",
    "the leading orientation dependent part of the energy is then obtained as @xmath238 a prolate spheroid ( @xmath239 ) thus minimizes its energy by pointing towards the mirror , while an oblate spheroid ( @xmath240 ) prefers to lie in a plane perpendicular to the mirror .",
    "( we assume that the perturbative results are not changed for large distortions . )",
    "these configurations are also preferred at small distances @xmath123 , since ( at fixed distance to the center ) the object reorients to minimize the closest separation .",
    "interestingly , the latter conclusion is not generally true . in ref .",
    "it has been shown that there can be a transition in preferred orientation as a function of @xmath123 in the simpler case of a scalar field with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the separation at which this transition occurs varies with the spheroid s eccentricity .      in this section",
    "we shall discuss some characteristic effects of the casimir interaction between metallic nano - particles by studying two spheres with _",
    "finite _ conductivity in the limit where their radius @xmath157 is much smaller than their separation @xmath123 .",
    "we assume further that @xmath157 is large compared to the inverse fermi wave vector @xmath241 of the metal . since typically @xmath241 is of the order of a few angstrom , this assumption is reasonable even for nano - particles .",
    "theories for the optical properties of small metallic particles @xcite suggest a drude dielectric function @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the conductivity which approaches for @xmath244 the dc conductivity @xmath245 . for bulk metals @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the plasma frequency with electron charge @xmath248 and electron mass @xmath249 , and @xmath250 is the relaxation time . with decreasing dimension of the particle ,",
    "@xmath251 is reduced compared to its bulk value due to finite size effects and hence becomes a function of @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the result for a sphere and a plate that are described by the drude model , we obtain for the large distance expansion of the energy the result @xmath252 as in the sphere - plate case , the leading term is material independent but different from that of the perfect metal limit ( where the amplitude is @xmath253 ) since only the electric polarization contributes . at next order ,",
    "the first and second terms in the parentheses come from magnetic and electric dipole fluctuations , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath254 is absent in the interaction between perfectly conducting spheres .",

    "a theory for the dielectric function of a cubical metallic particle of dimensions @xmath264 has been developed within the random phase approximation in the limit of low frequencies @xmath265 @xcite . in this theory",
    "it is further assumed that the discreteness of the electronic energy levels , and not the inhomogeneity of the charge distribution , is important .",
    "this implies that the particle responds only at the wave vector of the incident field which is a rather common approximation for small particles . from an electron number - conserving relaxation time approximation the complex dielectric function",
    "is obtained which yields the size - dependent dc conductivity for a cubic particle of volume @xmath266 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the detailed shape of the particle does not matter much , and we can set @xmath267 which defines the volume equivalent sphere radius @xmath157 . for @xmath268 the nano particle ceases to be conducting , corresponding to a metal - insulator transition due to the localisation of electrons for particles with a size of the order of the mean free path .",
    "it is instructive to consider the size dependence of @xmath251 and of the casimir interaction for a particular choice of material .",
    "following ref .  , we focus on small aluminum spheres with fermi energy @xmath259ev and @xmath261sec .",
    "these parameters correspond to @xmath260 and a plasma wavelength @xmath269 nm . it is useful to introduce the dimensionless conductivity @xmath256 , which is measured in units of @xmath257 with bohr radius @xmath258 , so that the important quantity of eq .",
