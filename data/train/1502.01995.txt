    "a topic that has been progressively gaining more attention over the last two decades within the nonlinear dynamical systems of the famous fermi - pasta - ulam type  @xcite , concerns the study of the so - called granular crystals  @xcite .",
    "the latter consist of chains of elastically interacting ( through the so - called hertzian contacts ) beads that are not only very experimentally accessible , but also extensively tunable and controllable , as regards their materials , geometry , heterogeneity , etc .",
    "another reason for the considerable appeal of such simple lattice structure , which can be tailored to be one- , two- or even three - dimensional , is the wealth of nonlinear excitations that have arisen in such settings , and which include robust traveling waves , bright and dark breather structures , and shock waves among others , as summarized in the above reviews .",
    "finally , yet another element promoting the interest in such setups concerns their potential relevance to a broad range of applications such as actuating devices @xcite , acoustic lenses  @xcite , mechanical diodes  @xcite , logic gates  @xcite and sound scramblers  @xcite .    arguably , the most significant and well - studied excitation , the principal workhorse around which many theoretical analyses and experimental results have been centered in such granular systems is the traveling wave .",
    "this structure was originally established in the pioneering work of nesterenko in  @xcite ( see also the review of  @xcite ) . while it was originally believed to be genuinely compact , asymptotic analysis illustrated its doubly exponential nature ( in the granular system without precompression ; in the presence of precompression the decay of the wave becomes exponential )  @xcite .",
    "> from a mathematically rigorous perspective , the work of  @xcite enabled as a special case example application the proof of existence of such a traveling wave in the work of  @xcite , while later the framework of  @xcite ( earlier also discussed in the physical / computational literature by  @xcite ) enabled the rigorous identification of the bell - shaped nature of the wave without  @xcite or with  @xcite precompression .",
    "more recently , variants of the standard granular system in which internal oscillators or resonators are present in each of the lattice nodes ( i.e. , for each of the beads ) have been proposed theoretically and some of them have also been realized experimentally .",
    "arguably , one of the earliest examples of this type ( which , however , has not yet been experimentally implemented , to the best of our knowledge ) is the so - called cradle system  @xcite , where a local , linear oscillator was added to each bead , enabling the observation of some intriguing dynamical features .",
    "more recently , another variant of the granular chain , namely the locally resonant granular crystals or so - called mass - in - mass or mass - with - mass systems have been proposed and experimentally realized , respectively in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the former setting involves an internal resonator within the chain ( e.g. a second bead embedded in the principal one ) , while in the latter case , the resonator is external to the bead ( see e.g. the prototype also put forth in  @xcite ) .",
    "the recent experiment of  @xcite is expected to provide a significant boost to studies along this direction , as it offered a different so - called woodpile configuration constructed out of orthogonally - stacked rods ( with every second rod aligned , in this alternating 0 - 90 degree configuration ) for which it was demonstrated that the mim / mwm description of a granular chain with an internal resonator can be tuned to be the relevant one  @xcite .",
    "in fact , such a system allows , depending on the parametric regime and the vibrational modes of the rods , to create settings where controllably two- or more internal resonator modes are relevant in the mathematical model description .",
    "moreover , this experiment reported the observation of traveling waves for this system with persistent tails .    the focus of the present study is to provide a rigorous analysis of the traveling waves in such a mim / mwm system bearing an internal resonator . in particular , the surprising finding that our analysis will rigorously establish concerns the fact that under special ( i.e. , non - generic or isolated ) so - called anti - resonance conditions , the traveling waves of this chain will _ still _ bear a bell - shaped structure , monotonically decaying on either side .",
    "that is to say , for such isolated combinations of the resonator mass / wave speed , the tails of the wave will be absent . on the contrary",
    ", the generic setting will , in fact , involve such a resonant excitation through the passing the wave of the internal resonator and as such , it will lead to the formation of the weakly nonlocal solitary waves ( nanoptera ) reported in  @xcite .",
    "our presentation of these results will be structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will provide the general setup of the problem and an integral ( single component ) reformulation thereof . in section 3 ,",
    "the main result will be presented and proved .",
    "finally , in section 4 , some supporting numerical computations will be provided in order to corroborate the relevant results .",
    "following the earlier mim / mwm studies  @xcite , we consider the prototypical mathematical model of the form : @xmath0+\\tilde{k}(x_i - x_i)\\\\ \\nu { \\partial}_{tt } x_i=-\\tilde{k}(x_i - x_i ) \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 represent the displacements of the granular beads and @xmath3 those of the internal ( or external ) resonators .",
    "@xmath4 corresponds to the ( normalized ) elastic constant of the bead - resonator coupling , while @xmath5 is the ( again , normalized to the mass of the beads ) mass of the resonator particles . in the strain variables",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , the equations take the form @xmath8    we first transform the problem to a setting which allows us to use the methods of calculus of variations .",
    "this is similar to the approach that we took in the earlier works @xcite to treat the case of monomer chains ( in the absence of resonators ) .",
    "we are now looking for traveling wave solutions of in the form @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where we assume that @xmath9 will be a positive function and we set hereafter for simplicity @xmath12 . plugging this ansatz in the system yields the following system of advance - delay differential equations @xmath13 where",
    ", we have introduced the discrete laplacian @xmath14    in order to restate the problem in its equivalent fourier variable form , we introduce the fourier transform and its inverse as @xmath15 the second derivative operator @xmath16 has the following representation @xmath17 whereas @xmath18 thus , taking fourier transform in the second equation of allows us to express @xmath19 plugging this last formula in the first equation of then yields the following equation for @xmath20 @xmath21 solving for @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath22      with the assignment @xmath23 , we can represent @xmath24 which allows us to further rewrite as follows @xmath25 recall that ( see @xcite and also @xcite , @xcite ) taking the `` tent '' function , @xmath26 or @xmath27 we have @xmath28 .",
    "next , we compute the inverse fourier transform of @xmath29 .",
    "we have @xmath30 whence @xmath31=   -{\\frac{1}{2 a c } } \\sin\\left({\\frac{a}{c } } x\\right ) { \\rm sgn}(x).\\ ] ] thus , taking inverse fourier transform in , we obtain the analogous to  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) representation for the solution of the form : @xmath32 the next task is to compute the kernel @xmath33 clearly , this is an even function , being the convolution of two even functions .",
    "thus , we only need to compute it for @xmath34 and then we can take an even extension across zero .",
    "a direct computation shows @xmath35 at this point , we introduce a few more notations in order to rewrite in more compact form .",
    "namely , let @xmath36 _ note that the function @xmath37 is compactly supported only if @xmath38 .",
    "_    we can now rewrite in the form @xmath39 for positive solutions of , we can take the transformation @xmath40 , which leads us to @xmath41 denote @xmath42 note that @xmath43 and the problem now reads @xmath44      hereafter , we restrict ourselves to the case of compactly supported kernel @xmath45 in the convolution problem .",
    "that is , we require @xmath46 in order to achieve that the function @xmath37 ( and hence @xmath45 ) is supported in @xmath47 .",
    "we refer to as the * anti - resonance condition * for the parameters .",
    "notice that this is a condition that physically connects the mass of the resonator ( or effectively the ratio of its mass to that of the principal bead ) to the speed of the wave .",
    "we can then obtain the following    [ le:15 ] let @xmath48 .",
    "there exists an irrational number @xmath49 , so that for @xmath50 , the kernel @xmath51 is positive in @xmath52 . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the function @xmath45 is decreasing in @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath45 is obviously an even function , it suffices to consider the case @xmath54 .",
    "taking the derivative of @xmath45 , we see that @xmath55 so long as @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 is decreasing in @xmath52 for @xmath56 .",
    "next , we study the positivity of @xmath45 . again",
    ", it suffices to consider @xmath57 .",
    "we have @xmath58.\\ ] ] since @xmath59 , we can rewrite the last expression as follows @xmath60.\\ ] ] now , since @xmath61 we conclude that @xmath62 , provided @xmath63    we can now proceed to establish our main result .",
    "we have the following main result .",
    "[ theo : main ] let @xmath64 for some integer @xmath65 .",
    "then , for @xmath56 , the equation ( and hence ) has bell - shaped solution @xmath9 .",
    "that is , there is @xmath66 a positive , even , @xmath67 smooth function , so that @xmath9 is decaying in @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , @xmath9 is doubly exponentially decaying , just as the travelling waves in the classical monomer case .    for @xmath69",
    ", the problem ( and hence ) has a positive solution @xmath9 , which we can not guarantee to be bell - shaped  .",
    "we perform the proof in several steps , under the different assumptions on @xmath70 .",
    "following the idea in @xcite , we let @xmath71 and we set up the following maximization problem @xmath72 note that @xmath73 .",
    "the plan of actions is as follows : we first show that has a solution with the desired properties .",
    "after that , we derive its euler - lagrange equation .",
    "this is of course closely related to , except for the lagrange multipliers , which need to be adjusted .",
    "we will show that the following lemma holds .",
    "[ le:14 ] let @xmath50 .",
    "then , the maximization problem has a solution .",
    "moreover , this solution is positive .",
    "if in addition @xmath56 , then it is also bell - shaped .",
    "first , we show that the quantity @xmath74 is bounded , if @xmath75 satisfies the constraint . indeed , by hlder s and young s inequality",
    ", we have that @xmath76 . ] @xmath77 but @xmath45 is a bounded function with support in @xmath47 , hence @xmath78 .",
    "next , we show that an eventual solution to is necessarily positive . indeed , for any function @xmath75",
    ", we have that the function @xmath79 satisfies the constraint and moreover @xmath80 thus , the supremum in may be taken over all @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , one can see that if @xmath75 is not non - negative , then @xmath82 provides a bigger value and hence @xmath75 may not be a solution to .",
    "denote @xmath83 clearly , @xmath84 . pick a maximizing sequence , say @xmath85 .",
    "that is @xmath86 and @xmath87 we will show that ( an appropriate translate of ) @xmath88 converges strongly ( in @xmath89 ) to a solution @xmath90 . to that end",
    ", we apply the concentration compactness method of lions , @xcite .",
    "the outcome is that ( after we pick a subsequence , which we call again @xmath88 ) , one of three scenarios occur :    * ( tightness ) there exists @xmath91 , so that for each @xmath92 , there is @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 * ( vanishing ) for every @xmath95 , there is @xmath96 * ( dichotomy ) there exists @xmath97 , so that for any @xmath92 , there are @xmath93 and @xmath98 , @xmath91 , so that for all large enough @xmath99 , @xmath100    we will proceed to show that vanishing and dichotomy may not occur , which will leave us with tightness . in the tightness scenario , we will easily show that a translate of @xmath101 will converge strongly to @xmath90 . +",
    "* vanishing does not occur : * + assume that it does . let @xmath92 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is so large that @xmath104 for all @xmath105 .",
    "we have for each @xmath106 , @xmath107 since @xmath108 , and the integration is over @xmath109 , it follows that @xmath110.\\ ] ] we have by young s inequality that @xmath111 it follows that @xmath112 where in the last inequality , we have used . summing the last inequality over @xmath113 yields @xmath114 for all large enough @xmath99 and for all @xmath92 . on the other hand @xmath115 , which will be a contradiction ,",
    "if we have had selected @xmath116 small enough .",
    "note that again , we have used @xmath117 . thus , vanishing may not occur .",
    "+ * dichotomy does not occur : * + assume that it does .",
    "let @xmath92 and denote @xmath118 so that @xmath119 .",
    "from support considerations and the young s estimates that we have provided earlier , it is clear that for all large enough @xmath99 @xmath120 now , from the definition of @xmath121 @xmath122 similarly , @xmath123 putting everything together yields @xmath124 this is again produces a contradiction ( with a judiciously small choice of @xmath116 ) , since + @xmath115 , @xmath125 .",
    "thus , dichotomy does not occur either .",
    "thus , tightness is the only alternative .",
    "now , consider @xmath126 .",
    "note that @xmath127 satisfies the constraint and also @xmath128 .",
    "we have that for all @xmath92 , there exists @xmath93 , so that @xmath129 for all @xmath130 .",
    "now , by weak compactness in @xmath89 , it follows that @xmath127 has a weakly convergent subsequence ( denoted again by @xmath127 for convenience ) , with a limit say @xmath90 .",
    "we now claim that the sequence @xmath131 is strongly pre - compact in @xmath132 . indeed , by the young s inequality , we have for all @xmath130 @xmath133 where by inspection @xmath134",
    ". also @xmath135 by the compactness criteria in @xmath132 spaces ( i.e. the riesz - tamarkin condition ) , it follows that @xmath131 is pre - compact .",
    "this , together with the pointwise limit @xmath136 , which follows from the weak convergence of @xmath137 implies that for some subsequence @xmath138 we now have by hlder s @xmath139 thus , @xmath140 on the other hand , by the lower semicontinuity of the norm with respect to the weak convergence @xmath141 .",
    "but then @xmath142 , since otherwise @xmath143 a contradiction .",
    "thus , we have shown that the limit @xmath90 is indeed a solution to the maximization problem .      in this case , we have that the kernel @xmath45 is bell - shaped .",
    "we show now that the solution @xmath90 is in addition bell - shaped . in order to explain the setup , we need a few definitions .    for a function @xmath144",
    ", one defines the distribution function @xmath145 clearly , the function @xmath146 is non - increasing , whence one can define its `` inverse '' as follows @xmath147 we call @xmath148 _ the non - increasing rearrangement _ of @xmath149 .",
    "note that the two functions have the same distribution function , that is @xmath150 , so in particular @xmath151 . finally , define the even function @xmath152 , which also satisfies @xmath153 .",
    "clearly , a function is bell - shaped if and only if @xmath154 . in this",
    "setting , we have the riesz rearrangement inequality , @xcite , , which states @xmath155 using that fact and since @xmath45 is bell - shaped , it is clear that in the maximization problem , we can restrict our attention to bell - shaped entries @xmath75 . indeed , taking an arbitrary function @xmath75 , note that @xmath156 would satisfy the constraint @xmath157 and moreover , by the riesz rearrangement inequality @xmath158 based on the above formulation , one may derive the existence of @xmath90 the same way as before .",
    "note however that one may completely circumvent the lions concentration compactness arguments in the bell - shaped case .",
    "indeed , assuming that @xmath75 is bell - shaped and satisfies the constraint @xmath159 , we have for every @xmath34 , @xmath160 hence @xmath161 .",
    "thus , any maximizing sequence @xmath162 of bell - shaped functions will produce a pre - compact in @xmath132 sequence @xmath163 .",
    "indeed , we have , similarly to the arguments above that @xmath164 . in addition , by support considerations for any @xmath165 , we have for every @xmath130 @xmath166 as @xmath167 , since @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the elementary pointwise bounds obtained from bell - shapedness help us verify immediately the riesz - tamarkin criteria and hence the pre - compactness of @xmath163 in @xmath132 , without having to resort to the lions theory .",
    "after that , we finish by standard arguments as before .      the next step is to derive the euler - lagrange equation that the solution @xmath90 of satisfies .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "take @xmath169 and a test function @xmath170 .",
    "since @xmath90 is a maximizer for , it must be that @xmath171 for all @xmath172 .",
    "we can rewrite this as follows @xmath173 taking taylor expansions in @xmath116 , we find @xmath174 plugging in this in , we obtain @xmath175 which is valid for all @xmath172 . taking limit as @xmath176 , we obtain @xmath177 since this is satisfied for all test functions @xmath170 and @xmath178 , we obtain @xmath179 if we now take @xmath180 , @xmath181 clearly , with an appropriate choice of @xmath182 , we can arrange so that @xmath183 indeed satisfies .",
    "we now proceed to show that @xmath183 and @xmath184 are both @xmath67 .",
    "first , let us see that from the equation , the function @xmath183 never vanishes .",
    "indeed , assume the opposite , @xmath185 .",
    "then , @xmath186 since @xmath187 in @xmath47 , it would follow that @xmath188 .",
    "iterating this argument yields that @xmath189 for all @xmath190 , a contradiction .",
    "now , we have from that @xmath9 is differentiable and moreover @xmath191 it follows that @xmath192 is continuous . by induction , we can show @xmath193 and hence @xmath194 is continuous , since @xmath195 are all continuous and @xmath196 . for integer values of @xmath197 ,",
    "this is obvious . even for non - integer values of @xmath197",
    ", @xmath198 is as smooth as @xmath9 , since @xmath199 .    finally , let us establish the double exponential rate of decay for the bell - shaped solutions of .",
    "so , assuming @xmath56 , we have that @xmath9 is bell - shaped and @xmath45 is decaying for @xmath34 .",
    "we have @xmath200 denote @xmath201 , so that @xmath202 using the bell - shapedness of both @xmath45 and @xmath9 we conclude @xmath203 iterating this inequality for @xmath204 , @xmath205 which yields the double exponential rate of decay for @xmath206 and hence for @xmath9 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ theo : main ] .    in order to corroborate the above conclusions , as well as to examine the cases which do not adhere to the conditions of the above theorem ( both cases of anti - resonance , but with @xmath207 , as well as cases where the anti - resonance condition is not satisfied ) , we turn to some case example numerical computations in the next section .",
    "when @xmath208 , @xmath209 , we obtained the expression of kernel @xmath210 ( as shown in lemma 1 ) in the convolution equation : @xmath211 when a solution of @xmath9 is obtained , one can similarly find @xmath212 from : @xmath213 and its corresponding integral equation @xmath214 where @xmath215\\chi_{(-1,1)}(x).\\ ] ] using the above expressions , the solution for both the bead and the resonator strains can be not only theoretically analyzed but also numerically computed .    due to the similarity between @xmath216 and @xmath217 , we will mainly discuss the properties of @xmath217 and those of @xmath216 directly follow .",
    "since @xmath217 is an even function and has finite support @xmath47 , we only need to consider its properties on @xmath52 . noting that @xmath218 , @xmath219 , we appreciated that @xmath217 is continuous everywhere but not continuously differentiable at @xmath220 .",
    "we now separate the different cases of interest .    1 .   the case analyzed fully in the previous section ( i.e. , the `` best case scenario '' ) : when @xmath53 , @xmath221 for @xmath222 so that @xmath217 is increasing on @xmath223 $ ] and decreasing on @xmath224 $ ] .",
    "this regime also implies the positivity of @xmath217 since @xmath225 . due to these good features of @xmath210 , and as a by - product of the proof of the previous section",
    ", our numerical computations confirm that the system bears bell - shaped solutions for @xmath9 and @xmath212 , as illustrated in the typical results shown in fig .",

    "in the present work , we have explored systems in the form of mass in mass or mass with mass dynamical lattices possessing an internal resonator , studying their traveling waves . in particular",
    ", we could explore the case of so - called anti - resonances whereby for a particular set of `` quantized '' relations between the resonator mass and the wave speed ( and for suitably small resonator masses ) , a bell - shaped traveling wave could be rigorously proven to exist .",
    "interestingly , the bell - shaped waves were numerically found to exist when the anti - resonance condition applies , even beyond the mass threshold for which our proof holds .",
    "however , a secondary threshold was identified for sufficiently large resonator masses , beyond which our iterative scheme for the numerical identification of the waves no longer converged .",
    "finally , when the anti - resonance condition is not upheld , typical findings suggest the existence of a wave of non - vanishing tail , in line also with recent experimental observations  @xcite .",
