    "the recent evidence for neutrino masses has brought forward leptogenesis @xcite as a very attractive mechanism to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe . along this mechanism , the baryon asymmetry of the universe is explained by the same interactions as the ones which can explain the neutrino masses . in the most straightforward seesaw model , which assumes right - handed neutrinos in addition to the standard model particles , both neutrino masses and leptogenesis",
    "originate from the yukawa interactions and lepton number violating majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for the lepton weak doublets and @xmath7 is related to the standard brout - englert - higgs ( hereafter simply higgs ) doublet @xmath8 by @xmath9 .    however , testing this mechanism will be a very difficult task for several reasons . if the right - handed neutrinos have a hierarchical mass spectrum , due to neutrino mass constraints , leptogenesis through @xmath10 decay can lead to the observed amount of baryon asymmetry e.g.  only if it involves right - handed neutrinos with masses above @xmath11  gev @xcite . as a result",
    "they can not be produced at colliders .",
    "moreover there are many more parameters in the yukawa coupling matrices which can play an important role for leptogenesis , than there are ( not too suppressed ) low energy observables which could constrain these parameters .",
    "if the right - handed neutrinos have instead a quasi - degenerate spectrum ( for at least 2 of them ) , leptogenesis can be efficient at lower scales @xcite but generically in this case the neutrino mass constraints require suppressed values of yukawa couplings , which hampers their production at colliders .    for leptogenesis to be both efficient and tested at low energy , not only",
    "is a quasi - degeneracy between 2 right - handed neutrinos required , but also a special flavour structure which allows for larger yukawa couplings while preserving the light neutrino mass constraints , and/or a right - handed neutrino production mechanisms other than through the yukawas and associated neutrino mixings .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of testing leptogenesis mechanisms the other way around . while they can not confirm leptogenesis ,",
    "could low energy observations at least exclude it ?",
    "we propose one particularly clear possibility , namely the observation of a right - handed charged gauge boson @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that for high mass right - handed neutrinos and @xmath0 , around @xmath12 gev or higher , the @xmath0 can have suppression effects on leptogenesis through dilution and scattering , but , in the specific case of reheating after inflation , they can also boost the @xmath10 abundances @xcite and hence relax the constraints on yukawa couplings .",
    "not surprisingly , with a low scale @xmath0 the suppression effects are dramatically enhanced .",
    "actually , see section 2 , they turn out to be so strongly enhanced that , even with a maximal cp asymmetry of order unity , leptogenesis can not be a sufficient cause of the matter excess anymore .",
    "right - handed gauge interactions lead in particular to much larger suppression effects at low scale than left - handed interactions do in other contexts ( i.e.  than in leptogenesis from scalar @xcite or fermion @xcite triplet decays , whose efficiency have been calculated in refs .",
    "this is due to the fact that at the difference of triplets , a single @xmath10 can interact through @xmath0 exchange with fermions which are all in thermal equilibrium , which induces more efficient , and hence dangerous , scatterings and decays .",
    "in particular , some of the scatterings involving the @xmath0 turn out to induce a very large suppression due to the fact that they do not decouple through a boltzmann suppression .",
    "the production of @xmath10 s through a light @xmath0 , often presented as the easiest way to produce @xmath10 s , is therefore incompatible with successful leptogenesis , and even enhanced @xmath10 production from reheating can not compensate for the large suppression .",
    "the lower bounds on the mass of the @xmath0 , required for successful leptogenesis , are given in section 3 .",
    "the possible discovery of a low - energy @xmath0 has recently been the object of several analysis by lhc collaborations @xcite .",
    "it should be feasible up to @xmath13 - 5  tev ( see more details , and additional possible searches , in section 7 ) .",
    "the observation of a @xmath0 is not the only possibility to exclude canonical neutrino decay leptogenesis from current energy data .",
    "we give a list of other possibilities in section 5 , considering in particular the implications of the observation of a @xmath1 at lhc .",
    "the case of other leptogenesis seesaw models with not only or without right - handed neutrinos is briefly considered in section 6 .",
    "as well known the net rate of baryon asymmetry is given in any leptogenesis model by 3 ingredients , the cp asymmetry of the decaying particle , @xmath14 for a right - handed neutrino , the boltzmann equations which determine the efficiency @xmath15 and the @xmath6 to @xmath16 sphaleron conversion rate , which we denote by @xmath17 .",
    "let us first discuss and present our results for the case where the lepton asymmetry is created from the decay of a single right - handed neutrino , @xmath10 .",
    "later on we will discuss the generalization to more right - handed neutrinos . in this case , from these 3 ingredients the net baryon asymmetry produced by the @xmath10 decays is : @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 the comoving number density of the species `` i '' , `` eq '' refering to the equilibrium number density , and @xmath23 the comoving entropy density .",
    "for a particle previously in thermal equilibrium , the efficiency is unity by definition in absence of any washout effect from inverse decays or scatterings .",
    "if all lepton asymmetry has been produced before the sphaleron decoupling at the electroweak phase transition and if the sphalerons have had the time to thermalize completely the @xmath6 abundance , the conversion ratio between lepton and baryon number is given by @xcite @xmath24 where the last equality refers to the sm value , with @xmath25 the number of fermion families and @xmath26 the number of higgs doublets .",
    "in the right - handed neutrino decay leptogenesis model without any @xmath0 , the cp - asymmetry is defined by @xmath27 while the evolution of the comoving abundances is given as a function of @xmath28 by the boltzmann equations : @xmath29 -2 \\frac{y_{\\cal l}}{y_{l}^{\\rm eq}}\\left(\\gamma_{ns}^{\\rm sub}+\\gamma_{nt}+\\gamma_{ht } + \\gamma_{hs}\\,\\frac{y_{n}}{y_{n}^{\\rm eq}}\\right ) \\label{boltzstand2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath31 . the thermally averaged reaction rate @xmath32 parametrizes the effects of yukawa induced decays and inverse decays with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 bessel functions .",
    "the other @xmath35 s take into account the effects of the various scatterings through a @xmath36 or a @xmath10 in the @xmath23 or @xmath37 channels .",
    "they are related to the corresponding cross sections in the following way @xmath38 with @xmath39\\ , \\sigma(s)$ ] the reduced cross section , @xmath40\\equiv \\sqrt{(a - b - c)^2 -4bc}$ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the analytic expression of the reduced cross sections can be found in refs .",
    "we also neglect as in ref .",
    "@xcite the effects of yukawa coupling induced @xmath42 processes which have little effects too . ]",
    "@xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ boltzstand2 ] ) refers to the substracted scattering through a @xmath10 in the @xmath23 channel ( i.e.  taking out the contribution of the on - shell propagator in order to avoid double counting with the inverse decay contribution @xcite ) .",
    "the above , now traditional approach assumes that @xmath10 are introduced in an isolated way in the model . in many unifying groups ( left - right symmetric @xcite , pati - salam @xcite , @xmath44 @xcite or larger )",
    "the presence of the @xmath10 can be nicely justified as it is precisely the ingredient required to unify all fermions .",
    "these groups however do not introduce the @xmath10 in such an isolated way and moreover link the @xmath10 and @xmath0 masses to the same @xmath45 breaking scale @xmath46 .",
    "will also contribute to @xmath0 , but the opposite is not necessarily true . ]",
    "it is thus a ( generally unwarranted ) assumption to neglect the effect of @xmath45 gauge bosons .",
    "if @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath48  gev , these effects must be explicitly incorporated for any @xmath10 whose mass is not several orders of magnitude below the one of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "their effects for leptogenesis can be incorporated by modifying the boltzmann equations in the following way : @xmath53 with the cp asymmetry unchanged , as given by eq .",
    "( [ cpasym ] ) . in these boltzmann equations",
    "there are essentially 2 types of effects induced by the @xmath0 , both suppressing the produced lepton asymmetry : from the presence of alternate decay channels for the heavy neutrinos , @xmath54 , and from scatterings , @xmath55 , see below .",
    "\\a ) case @xmath56 : in this case the decay of @xmath10 to leptons or antileptons plus higgs particles remains the only possible 2 body decay channels but a series of three body decay channels with a _ virtual _",
    "@xmath0 is now possible : @xmath57 or @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath62 given the potentially large value of the gauge to yukawa couplings ratio , the three body decays can compete with the yukawa two body decay .",
    "since the gauge interactions do not provide any cp - violation and are flavor blind , it can be shown that they do not provide any new relevant source of cp - asymmetry .",
    "but still the gauge interaction - induced 3 body decays appear in both boltzmann equations , eqs .",
    "( [ nbogauge])-([lbogauge ] ) , with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total three body decay width .    unlike in leptogenesis without @xmath0 ,",
    "not all decays participate in the creation of the asymmetry but only a fraction @xmath65 does .",
    "this shows up in the boltzmann equations through the fact that eq .",
    "( [ nbogauge ] ) involves @xmath66 while the cp - asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ lbogauge ] ) is multiplied only by @xmath67 . )",
    ", we made the choice to keep eq .",
    "( [ cpasym ] ) as definition for the cp - asymmetry . in its denominator , it involves only the yukawa driven decay rather than the total decay width , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore this cp asymmetry does nt correspond anymore , as in standard leptogenesis , to the averaged @xmath69 which is created each time a @xmath10 decays .",
    "however this definition is convenient for several reasons .",
    "it makes explicit the fact that the gauge decay does not induce any lepton asymmetry .",
    "moreover in this way , all ( competing ) suppression effects , including the dilution one , are put together in the efficiency , not in the cp - asymmetry .",
    "it also allows to take the simple upper bound @xmath70 for any numerical calculations . ]",
    "this dilution effect leads automatically to an upper bound on the efficiency .",
    "the bound @xmath71 , which applies in standard leptogenesis for thermal @xmath10 s becomes : @xmath72 as a numerical example , for @xmath73  tev , with yukawa couplings of order @xmath74 , so that @xmath75  ev , and with @xmath76  tev we obtain the large suppression factor @xmath77 , consistent with leptogenesis only if the cp - asymmetry is of order unity , which requires maximal enhancement of the asymmetry ( i.e. right handed neutrino mass splittings of order of their decay widths ) .",
    "in addition to this dilution effect , the three body decay @xmath54 reaction density also induces a @xmath6 asymmetry washout effect from inverse decays ( proportional to @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ lbogauge ] ) ) which can also be large .",
    "\\b ) case @xmath79 : in this case much heavier than @xmath0 is in general not expected in the left - right symmetric model or extensions given the fact that , as said above , both @xmath0 and @xmath80 have a mass proportional to the @xmath45 breaking scale @xmath46 , and given the fact that @xmath81 with @xmath82 the ordinary gauge coupling which is of order unity . ]",
    "the direct 2 body decays @xmath83 are allowed which leads to an even larger dilution and washout effect for low @xmath84 .",
    "for example with @xmath85  tev , @xmath86 and @xmath87  gev , we get @xmath88 , which means that the dilution effect makes leptogenesis basically hopeless at this scale , even with the maximum value @xmath89 . in the following",
    "we will consider only the case where @xmath90 ( this corresponds to the situation where a discovery of the @xmath0 and @xmath10 at lhc would occur through same sign dilepton channel @xcite , see section 6 ) .         to compare eqs .",
    "( [ nbogauge ] , [ lbogauge ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ n1bogauge_new ] , [ n2bogauge_new ] , [ lbogauge_new ] ) let us first note that the @xmath91 equations differ from the @xmath92 equation only through the @xmath93 and @xmath94 terms .",
    "as in the one @xmath10 case it can be checked that the @xmath95 terms have very little effects because their reaction rates are smaller than the @xmath55 ones ( compare for example in fig .",
    "3.a @xmath96 with @xmath97 ) .",
    "the @xmath98 terms on the other hand have a size similar to the one of @xmath99 but they are multiplied by @xmath100 .",
    "this means that their effect is suppressed because those terms could be important only as long as the @xmath0 effects ( @xmath99 and @xmath54 ) dominate the thermalization of the @xmath101 ( with respect to the yukawa induced processes ) , but these @xmath0 effects equally affect @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "similarly it can be checked that the @xmath104 are of little importance .",
    "they are relevant only for very large values of both @xmath105 and @xmath106 , beyond the values of interest for our purpose . as a result all",
    "these terms can be neglected in eqs .",
    "( [ n1bogauge_new ] , [ n2bogauge_new ] ) and the evolution of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are essentially the same as the one of @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ nbogauge ] ) replacing @xmath107 by @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "there are no important differences at this level .",
    "differences however can come from eq .",
    "( [ lbogauge_new ] ) because this equation involves source and washout terms from both @xmath110 and @xmath111 . to discuss this equation",
    "it is useful to split it in two parts as follows @xmath112 with @xmath113 . clearly comparing the @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) boltzmann equations with the one @xmath10 corresponding equation , eq .",
    "( [ lbogauge ] ) , one observes that these equations are the same except that eqs .",
    "( [ labogauge ] , [ lbbogauge ] ) involve additional washout terms from @xmath111 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "since these terms can only decrease and @xmath116 there is a destructive interference between the contribution of @xmath110 and @xmath111 but even so , from the effects of all other terms , the following inequalities hold ( except for very large @xmath84 close to @xmath117  gev which is not of interest for our purpose ) . ]",
    "the absolute value of the lepton asymmetry obtained effects it is a good approximation to start from thermal distributions of @xmath118 , as explained above . therefore there is no change of sign of @xmath78 and the argument applies .",
    "] one consequently gets @xmath119 which gives @xmath120 with @xmath121 which refers to the lepton number asymmetry obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ nbogauge ] , [ lbogauge ] ) .",
    "this inequality has several consequences .",
    "( i ) it means that if leptogenesis is ruled out in the one @xmath10 case taking @xmath122 ( as above ) it will be also ruled out in the 2 @xmath10 case if we take @xmath123 ( which is the bound to be considered in this case , see ref .",
    "one just need to apply the results of figs .  2 and 5 to both terms of eq .  ( [ ineqyl ] ) .",
    "( ii ) as eq .  ( [ ineqyl ] ) obviously also holds for the case where we neglect the @xmath0 effects in the lepton number boltzman equation , this conclusion remains true even if we play with flavour ( applying to eq .",
    "( [ ineqyl ] ) the results of fig .",
    "( iii ) if , for a given value of @xmath124 and @xmath47 , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 are outside the allowed range of @xmath107 given in fig .  7.a",
    ", the lepton asymmetry produced will be too small .",
    "numerically it can be checked also that this figure remains valid to a good approximation for the @xmath125 case .",
    "for @xmath47 above @xmath126  tev the allowed region is shrinked by a hardly visible amount . as for the absolute lower bound on @xmath47 it is larger in the 2 @xmath10 case than in the one @xmath10 case ( i.e.  than the value @xmath127  tev above ) but not by more than a few tev . with more than 2 right - handed neutrinos these conclusions remain valid .",
