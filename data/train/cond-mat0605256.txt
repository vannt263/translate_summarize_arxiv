    "this is due to the fact that lightly branched material like stars or combs , which dominate the mid - range in the mass distribution , have a radius of gyration which is closer to that of linear polymers with the same molar mass than to that of randomly branched polymers .     on the acid fraction @xmath41 .",

    "we simplify this by recasting it to an effective one - dimensional problem which has the required rouse scaling , respects topological connectivity and gives correct result at some special known limits @xcite .",
    "a linear or effectively linear ( branched material with collapsed side arms ) chain can relax by reptation .",
    "when a large amount of material relaxes quickly , such that the dynamically dilated tube increases in diameter faster than the rate permitted by rouse relaxation , the effective orientational constraint responds more slowly by constraint release rouse motion and the dynamic dilation is modified @xcite .",

    "@xmath153 is well below the ginzburg - de  gennes criterion @xcite which is a feature of the highest @xmath8 polymers that distinguishes them from the others in the set .",
    "hence the difference is likely to be due to non - mean - field behavior of these samples .",
    "also , the four highest molar mass samples were prepared under slightly different conditions - where a partial reaction was carried out with stirring and , for the later part , the samples were reacted without stirring at a slightly elevated temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , our assumption of continuous stirred reaction may not be completely true for these samples .",
    "the dynamic exponents calculated from our calculations match with the experimental findings in the relevant @xmath8 range .    to investigate the behavior of the dynamic exponents with average segmental lengths between branch points , we calculated the relaxation properties of a series of molecules in the ideal mean - field gelation ensemble .",
    "the dependence of the relaxation exponent @xmath134 on @xmath156 falls about midway between the prediction of @xcite and the phenomenological form of @xcite .",
    "we find that the viscosity exponent becomes smaller as @xmath153 is lowered .",
    "this is due to the dominance of supertube rouse relaxation at long time scales for this class of polymers and , for small enough @xmath153 , the viscosity exponent for any @xmath156 approaches the rouse value applicable to the unentangled polymers .",
    "the recoverable compliance exponent @xmath17 in our calculations have values similar to those found in experiments .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the magnitude of @xmath23 , when calculated from our algorithm , is found to be much larger than experimental values on similarly branched systems .",
    "being the first moment of the relaxation modulus @xmath16 , the dominant contribution to @xmath23 comes from the long time behavior of @xmath16 , so is very sensitive to the assumptions on which the relaxation dynamics of the very largest clusters in the ensemble is based .",
    "the computational scheme we used to follow the relaxation in the melt extrapolates ideas of dynamic dilation and supertube relaxation which originally were formulated for linear or lightly branched systems to a highly branched system .",
    "in particular it assumes that the final supertube relaxation follows a rouse scaling corresponding to a linear object .",
    "the final relaxation , provided that the tail of the distribution is long enough , of largely unentangled high molar mass molecules may find a faster route by showing a zimm like relaxation , by which the largest clusters relax hydrodynamically in an effective solvent provided by the smaller clusters . in linear systems",
    "the transition molecular weight for this is the same as that for incomplete static screening of the larger molecules self - interactions .",
    "experimental results on model systems with high seniority and well characterized branching and molar mass are needed to quantitatively test the validity of the theory for accounting the long - time decay of stress in such highly branched systems",
    ".    in summary , a numerical calculation of the entangled rheology of a series of mean - field gelation ensemble polymers provide a remarkable support of the accuracy of the hierarchical relaxation process suggested by the tube model .",
