    "a @xmath0 ball is a nontopological soliton , the minimum energy configuration of the ( complex ) scalar field , whose existence is guaranteed by non - zero charge @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it appears naturally in supersymmetric theories @xcite . in particular in the gauge - mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking ,",
    "the @xmath0 ball is stable against the decay into fermions and other scalars for large enough charge @xmath0 , and can be the dark matter of the universe @xcite .",
    "such large @xmath0 balls are naturally produced in the early universe as byproducts of the affleck - dine mechanism for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "they could be detectable and/or constrained by various experiments @xcite and by considering astrophysically such as the capture by neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0 ball is determined by the shape of the scalar potential . in the gauge - mediated susy breaking , the potential is flat beyond the messenger scale , and the mass grows as @xmath1 @xcite . as the field amplitude becomes large , the potential will be dominated by the effect of gravity - mediation , and the features of the @xmath0 ball change such as @xmath2 , for example .",
    "we called this kind of the @xmath0 ball the new - type @xmath0 ball @xcite . as we mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the ` metamorphosis ' of the @xmath0 ball should take place smoothly .    in this article",
    ", we revisit the properties of the new - type @xmath0 balls , with special attention to clarify the transition region between the gauge and gravity mediation .",
    "this is partly because we must correct some misunderstandings found in @xcite , where they claim the new - type @xmath0 ball disintegrates into the gauge - type ones .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the features of the other kind of hybrid type of the @xmath0 ball considered in @xcite , where the gauge - type @xmath0 ball changes to the thin - wall - type @xmath0 ball ball . in this article",
    ", we call it the ` thin - wall - type ' @xmath0 ball because of its profile as shown in fig .",
    "[ gaugenr - prof ] .",
    "] as it fattens in the interior of the neutron star .",
    "this happens since the field value inside the @xmath0 ball can not grow further when the potential is lifted by nonrenormalizable operators at large field values .",
    "ball is not created through the affleck - dine mechanism , since the scalar field does not feel spatial instabilities while it stays on the nonrenormalizable potential . ]",
    "let us first review the general properties of the @xmath0 ball in the scalar theory wtih a global @xmath3 symmetry . in the context of susy @xmath0 balls ,",
    "the charge is usually the baryon and/or lepton numbers .",
    "the energy and charge are given respectively by @xmath4 , \\\\ q & = & \\frac{1}{i } \\int d^3x ( \\dot{\\phi}\\phi^ * - \\phi \\dot{\\phi}^*),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the potential .",
    "since the @xmath0 ball is the energy minimum configuration of the scalar field with finite charge @xmath0 , using a lagrange multiplier @xmath6 , we can write the energy as @xcite @xmath7.\\ ] ] energy minimum configuration is obtained when the solution is spherical symmetric and rotating : @xmath8 . then , the energy is rewritten as @xmath9 + \\omega q.\\ ] ] in order to obtain the energy minimum solution , we just have to solve the equation @xmath10=0,\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in the next sections ,",
    "we apply the above argument and solve the equation ( [ eom ] ) numerically for two kinds of hybrid - type @xmath0 balls : one is the gauge - type and new - type @xmath0 balls , and the other is the gauge - type and thin - wall - type @xmath0 balls .",
    "the potential is written as @xcite @xmath13 where the first ( second ) term comes from the gauge- ( gravity-)mediation effect . here",
    "@xmath14 is the scalar mass in the vacuum , @xmath15 the gravitino mass , @xmath16 the coefficient of the one - loop effect , and @xmath17 a renormalization scale . when the each term of the potential dominates , the properties of each type of the @xmath0 ball are well known . for the gauge - type @xmath0 ball , the energy @xmath18 , the size @xmath19 , the rotation speed @xmath6 , and the field value at the center @xmath20 are given by @xcite @xmath21 while for the new - type @xmath0 ball @xcite , @xmath22 to look also for the transition region",
    ", we solve numerically eq.([eom ] ) for the potential ( [ pot - new ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ new - para ] , the energy , size , the field value , and energy per charge as a function of the charge are shown . in these figures ,",
    "we set @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "one can see the features of both gauge - type and new - type @xmath0 balls , _",
    "i.e. _ , eqs.([prop - gauge ] ) and ( [ prop - new ] ) , are reproduced in fig .  [ new - para ] .",
    "moreover , those parameters are smoothly connected in the transition region , as it should be . in particular , the energy per charge @xmath26 always decreases as the charge @xmath0 increases , which implies that the larger @xmath0 ball is energetically favored .",
    "this shows that the new - type @xmath0 ball is stable against disintegration into smaller gauge - type @xmath0 balls , so that it can be the dark matter of the universe , contrary to the claim in ref .",

    "we have revisited the new - type of the @xmath0 ball , and clarified its properties . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the energy per charge @xmath26 as a function of the charge @xmath0 , and reconfirmed the stability of the new - type q ball to be the dark matter of the universe .",
    "this corrects some misunderstandings in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have investigated the feature of the @xmath0 ball , transiting from the gauge - type to thin - wall - type @xmath0 balls , which was considered in the context of the @xmath0-ball capture by the neutron star in ref .  @xcite .",
