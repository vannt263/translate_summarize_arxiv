    "the presence of chemical short - range order ( sro ) in @xmath4-ti - al was proposed over thirty years ago by blackburn and williams @xcite to explain planar slip exhibited by alloys with concentrations greater than roughly 4 wt .",

    "% al ) @xcite . since that time sro has been discussed as an important factor contributing to the anomalous solid - solution strengthening of @xmath4-ti - al @xcite , as well as the low strain hardening exponents exhibited by these alloys @xcite .",

    "these measurements confirm the presence of appreciable sro in ti-6 wt .",
    "% al alloys , of a type consistent with the ordered d0@xmath2 structure of @xmath5 ti@xmath6al .",
    "as first proposed by fisher @xcite , sro in solid solutions can provide a significant source of strengthening due to the energy cost associated with the creation of `` diffuse '' antiphase boundaries ( dapb ) arising from shearing of the lattice by dislocation slip .",
    "the dapb is the analogue for structures with sro of the more familiar antiphase - boundary ( apb ) in a long - range - ordered crystal structure . in solid solutions with chemical sro ,",
    "the energy cost of creating a dapb ( @xmath7 , defined as the excess energy per unit area of a dapb ) during slip gives rise to a friction stress on moving dislocations : @xmath8 . a plot of the dapb energy versus the number of shearing events , calculated from first - principles for @xmath4-ti - al alloys using the approach described below , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figgpt ] .",
    "this plot is qualitatively similar to theoretical results obtained for fcc - based alloy systems previously @xcite .",
    "the energy of the dapb after the first shear ( to be referred to as @xmath9 ) is seen to be larger than the values ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . ) of @xmath7 after multiple shearing events .",
    "as pointed out originally by cohen and fine @xcite , the second slip event in a solid - solution with sro can partially restore the state of order , giving rise to a decrease in @xmath12 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ figgpt ] ) and a driving force for the pairing of leading dislocations in pile - ups .",
    "such pairing has been observed recently by transmission electronc microscopy ( tem ) for dislocation pile - ups in @xmath4-ti - al @xcite .",
    "[ figgpt ] also illustrates that after a small number of slip events the state of order is largely destroyed and subsequent dislocations experience negligible friction stress due to sro . by this `` glide - plane - softening '' mechanism ,",
    "sro can promote planar slip in solid solutions , as proposed for @xmath4-ti - al alloys by blackburn and williams @xcite .",
    "several tem - based experimental studies have been undertaken to estimate the magnitude of @xmath13 from observed dislocation structures @xcite in short - range - ordered alloys .",

    "magnitudes of @xmath10 for dapbs on prism planes were estimated from the critical stress required to form screw dislocation dipoles from elongated `` hair - pin '' loops , while the difference @xmath14 was estimated from measured spacings between paired leading edge dislocations in pile - ups .",
    "this work represents the first direct measurement of the friction stress due to sro in @xmath4-ti - al and is an important contribution to the detailed understanding of deformation properties in these alloys .",
    "the purpose of the research reported in this manuscript is to provide an independent theoretical estimate of dapb energies in this system .",

    "we begin by discussing first - principles results for the structure , energetics and stress of apbs in ordered @xmath5 ti@xmath6al .",
    "the apb energy results serve as a basis for testing the predictive power of the calculated model interatomic interaction parameters for hcp - based ti - al alloys .",
    "the next section is devoted to a detailed discussion of our study of dapb energies .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath7 for dapbs on prism planes are found to be consistent with the recent experimental estimates of neeraj _ et al . _",
    "mentioned above .",
    "the apb energies were calculated using the local density approximation ( lda ) to density functional theory ( dft ) , as implemented in the vasp package @xcite , which relies on ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite and a plane wave basis .",
    "the plane wave energy cutoff was set to 270 ev while the number of @xmath15-points was chosen to be at least 3500/(atom@xmath16 ) for all structures . )",
    "@xmath15-points would be selected for a structure with @xmath17 atom per unit cell . ]",
    "a supercell geometry was used , where a periodic array of apbs is set up .",
    "it was verified that the apbs are sufficiently spaced from one another to avoid interactions by computing the apb energy for different supercell sizes .",
    "separations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 monolayers were considered .",
    "atomic positions were fully relaxed and the dimensions of the supercell perpendicular to the plane of the apb were allowed to relax to give zero normal stress .",
    "the lattice parameters along the plane of the interface were frozen to the equilibrium lattice parameter of the do@xmath2 structure .",
    "the error bars we provide were derived by studying the convergence of our results with respect to plane wave energy cutoff , number of @xmath15-points , supercell size and the tolerance for residual forces and stresses for the numerical determination of the equilibrium geometry .",
    "we consider the apb lying in the basal @xmath20 $ ] and prism @xmath21 $ ] planes , as these are the main active slip systems in ti - al alloys .",
    "the calculated apb energies are reported in table [ tabapb ] . while there is only one type of basal apb , there are two types of prism apb , differing by the location of the apb plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figp12 ] .",
    "as shown in table [ tabapbcomp ] , the calculated apb energies  are comparable to the result of earlier all - electron first - principles calculations @xcite , indicating that the pseudopotential approximation used provides reliable results . our energies are systematically smaller , however , perhaps due to a more thorough treatment of the relaxations made possible by the high computational efficiency of pseudopotential - based methods .",
    "table [ tabapbcomp ] also shows that the apb energies calculated from first principles differ markedly from experimental estimates @xcite , which were obtained from measurements of the spacing between dissociated dislocations , inferring the interface energy through mechanical equilibrium considerations involving the trade - off between elastic and interfacial energy .",
    "as discussed in the next section , we estimate that the accuracy of first - principles calculations may be responsible for an overestimation of at most 40% of the apb  energies .",
    "this error is significantly smaller that the observed disagreement with experimental estimates .",
    "the level of discrepancy between theory and experiment displayed in table [ tabapbcomp ] has been observed for related intermetallic systems @xcite . while the source of this discrepancy remains unclear , we note that the equilibrium spacings implied by our apb energies ( using the same elastic constants as in @xcite ) are 3.0 nm , 7.0 nm , and 1.6 nm ,  respectively , for the basal , prism i , and prism ii apb .",
    "these values are all very close to the _ minimum _ dislocation spacings measured by @xcite .",
    "the calculated apb energies are consistent with an intuitive bond - breaking picture .",
    "the prism i , basal and prism ii apb respectively create 0,1 and 2 al - al bonds , implying that the basal apb should have an energy than is approximately equal to the average of the prism i and prism ii apb ( @xmath22 mj / m@xmath1 ) .",
    "our calculations also provide interface stress and displacements ( see table [ tabapb ] ) .",
    "an analysis of their sign and magnitude reveals interesting features of the relaxation taking place in the vicinity of an apb in ti@xmath6al which may help in interpreting the stress and displacement fields that can be quantified with tem .",
    "for the two apbs that result in a change of the nearest neighbor environment ( basal and prism ii ) , the interface contracts perpendicular to the plane of the apb ( @xmath23 ) and a tendency to expand along the plane of the interface ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "this behavior is reversed for the prism i apb , where no change in the nearest - neighbor environment occurs . the fact that , in all cases , the stress along the interface and the displacement perpendicular to it have opposite signs can be understood from a volume conservation argument . however , we were unable to rationalize the relative magnitudes of the stresses and displacements on the basis of intuitive atomic size considerations .",
    "this is not surprising given that such a picture is unable to describe the differences in bond length between hcp ti and ( metastable ) hcp al . according to our first - principles calculations , in these two pure elements , the ti - ti bonds are longer than al - al bonds lying along the ( 0001 ) plane while the opposite is true for other nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "the calculation of diffuse anti - phase boundary ( dapb ) energies requires the construction of a thermodynamic model of the alloy .",
    "the cluster expansion formalism @xcite was used to parametrize the configurational dependence of the energy of the alloy system : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the occupation of site @xmath28 ( @xmath29 for al , @xmath30 for ti ) while the @xmath31 are effective interaction parameters to be determined from first principles and where the summations are taken over every singlet , pair , triplet , ... of lattice sites . the so - called effective cluster interactions ( eci ) @xmath31 embody all the contributions to the energetics of the alloy , including relaxations of the atoms away from their ideal lattice sites .",
    "these eci were fitted to the energies of a set of @xmath32 periodic structures calculated from first - principles using the same techniques and parameters as for the apb calculations .",
    "this procedure was carried out using the maps software package @xcite which automates most of the tasks required to apply the cluster expansion formalism .",
    "the eci provide all the information we need to compute the dapb energies .",
    "first , the eci can be directly used to perform monte carlo simulations @xcite  that allow a first - principles computation of the phase diagram of the alloy system and degree of short - range order present in the alloy at a given temperature and composition ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "to this effect , we set up a monte carlo simulation cell consisting of a @xmath33 supercell of the hcp unit cell .",
    "the initial configuration was chosen to be random and @xmath34 equilibration monte carlo passes were performed before the short - range order was computed during an additional @xmath35 passes .",
    "the size of simulation cell and the number of simulation steps are such that the statistical noise in the computed short - range order parameters is orders of magnitude smaller than the error arising from the precision of the eci themselves .",
    "the dapb energies @xmath36 per unit area can then be directly expressed in terms of the eci and the short - range order parameters obtained from the monte carlo simulation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a function that maps a given site @xmath28 onto its new position , after the anti - phase boundary has been created and where @xmath39 denotes the thermodynamic and spatial average of the correlation between the occupation of sites @xmath28 and @xmath40 . the sum is taken over all pairs ( triplets , etc . ) that are not equivalent under a translation lying in the dapb plane which leaves the lattice invariant .",
    "@xmath41 is the area of a repeat unit of the plane of interest .",
    "this formulation , which is equivalent to the one introduced by schwander @xcite , has the advantage that it makes the most efficient use of all the information provided by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "it allows us to obtain dapb energies _ without _ having to average over various dapb energy obtained by running a dislocation through various snapshots of the monte carlo cell during the simulation .",
    "this averaging is implicitly taken into account through the averaging of the correlations @xmath42 over the monte carlo steps and over all symmetrically equivalent clusters . as the cluster expansion does not directly provide information regarding the area @xmath41",
    ", we assume the disordered phase to be an hcp phase with the idea @xmath43 ratio and with an average atomic volume equal to the one of the do@xmath2 structure . for a system with a small size mismatch ( @xmath44% , in our case ) ,",
    "the error in @xmath41 introduced by this approximation will amount to at most @xmath45% .    since we have access to the energy of a finite number of structures",
    ", we can only determine a finite number of eci and the expansion defined by equation ( [ cemain ] ) needs to be truncated .",
    "the choice of the optimal number of terms to keep was made through the following statistical analysis .",
    "as our goal is ultimately to predict dapb energies , we seek to construct a cluster expansion that exhibits a good predictive power for alloy configurations similar to perfect apb .",
    "this exercise does not merely consists in trying many different ranges of interaction until one happens to predict apb energies that agree with the calculated ones .",
    "the agreement could be fortuitous and the predictive power of the cluster expansion for configurations that are slightly different from a perfect apb , such as a dapb , could be poor . instead , we calculate the statistical variance of the predicted apb energies for various choices of range of interaction , and look for the choice that minimizes that variance .",
    "the statistical variance is computed as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the vector of all the selected eci and let @xmath47 be their estimated covariance matrix .",
    "be an @xmath17-dimenstional vector and @xmath48 be a @xmath49 matrix . from standard statistical analysis ,",
    "the covariance matrix of a parameter vector @xmath50 obtained from a least square fit @xmath51 can be estimated by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mean square error of the fit . ] the energy of a given apb , @xmath54 is related to the vector @xmath46 of all eci by equation ( [ linapb ] ) , where the correlations @xmath55 are calculated for a perfect do@xmath2 structure .",
    "this linear relationship can be written as , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is some vector . as a result ,",
    "the variance matrix of the predicted apb energy is then simply given by : @xmath58 .",
    "the eci of the cluster expansion that were found to minimize the sum of the statistical variances of the predicted apb energies are listed in table [ tabeci ] .",
    "the eci we calculated are very close to the ones that were determined in @xcite by a fit to the experimental ti - ti@xmath6al phase boundary .",
    "the resulting cluster expansion predicts apb energies that agree remarkably well with the calculated apb ( see table [ predapb ] ) , given that the perfect apb energies were not used in the fit of the cluster expansion .",
    "the difference between the calculated and predicted energies is of the same order of magnitude as the error bars , confirming that our variance calculations indeed provide a very good measure of the true predictive power of the cluster expansion . a similar variance analysis will be used in the next section to estimate the errors on our calculated dapb energies .",
    "although the selected range of interaction is by construction the one that will best predict the apb energies , it is still possible that longer range interactions may have an important effect on the calculated thermodynamic properties of the alloy . to investigate this concern , longer range interactions were gradually added . adding up to @xmath59 additional pair interactions and @xmath45 triplet interactions changed the temperature of the do@xmath60hcp transition by less than 200k and we are thus confident that our short - range cluster expansion is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "table [ ce_param ] gives a few characteristics of our cluster expansion .",
    "the precision of the cluster expansion is quite good , as can be seen by the value of both the mean square error and the cross - validation score .",
    "where @xmath61 is the calculated energy of structure @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the value of the same energy predicted using the cluster expansion fitted to the remaining @xmath64 structures . ]    the temperature @xmath65 of the do@xmath60hcp transition was calculated to be @xmath66k , which is about 40% higher than the known experimental transition temperature of @xmath67k .",
    "such an overestimation of transition temperatures is quite common in first - principles calculations based on the local - density approximation and short - ranged cluster expansions ( a list of systems where such first - principles phase diagram calculations have been undertaken can be found in @xcite ) . to correct for this overestimation of @xmath65 , we normalize all our temperatures by @xmath65 .",
    "experimental measurements should then be compared with the calculations performed at the same normalized temperature . in fig .",
    "[ figpb ] , the ti - rich portion of the calculated phase diagram is seen to agree very well with the experimentally measured one , when both are normalized to have the same @xmath65 .",
    "the error in the calculated transition temperature provides us with an estimate of the error introduced by ( i ) the use of the local density approximation in the first - principles calculations ( ii ) neglecting non - configurational sources of entropy , such as lattice vibrations and electronic entropy , and ( iii ) inaccuracies in the description of the configurational free energy arising from the truncation of the cluster expansion to a finite number of terms ( see above ) .",
    "we thus expect our perfect and diffuse apb energies to be biased upward by at most 40% ( this correction has neither been applied to our result nor been included in the error bars , in order to allow comparison with other first - principles results ) .",
    "our first main result is that ti - rich ti - al alloys do indeed exhibit a substantial amount of short - range order , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsro ] , which plots the warren - cowley short - range order parameters @xcite as a function of distance .",
    "this short - range order is of the do@xmath2 type .",
    "figures [ figgpt ] and [ figgpx ] show the calculated values of the dapb energies @xmath68 for the prism dapb for the temperatures and concentrations marked by a cross in fig .",
    "[ figpb ] .",
    "energies of the basal dapb are not shown , as they are nearly identical to those for the prism dapb , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figgpb ] for one specific temperature and concentration . in these plots ,",
    "the abscissa @xmath15 represents the magnitude of the shift ( in multiples of lattice vectors ) between the two half crystals on each side of the dapb , or , alternatively , the number of dislocations needed to create the dapb .",
    "error bars are not shown for clarity , but amount to about 15% of the calculated dapb energies resulting from the statistical noise in the fitted eci .",
    "note that the two types of prism apb can no longer be distinguished in a short - range ordered alloy because the dapb plane cuts through various short - range ordered domains which have a random relative phase , resulting in a single average interfacial energy .",
    "the plots exhibit the characteristic oscillations that are expected from the observation that , in a perfectly ordered do@xmath2 structure , every other dislocation would restore a perfect state of order . in a short - range ordered alloy ,",
    "the ability of subsequent dislocations to restore the original state of order decreases with the number of dislocations as a result of the short - range nature of the state of order .",
    "our estimates of the dapb energies are comparable to those found experimentally @xcite . for @xmath4 ti-6 wt .",
    "% al alloys annealed at temperatures between 600 and 350@xmath69c , experimental estimates of @xmath10 ranged between 25 and 48 mj / m@xmath1 , while a value of 6 mj / m@xmath1 was quoted for the difference @xmath70 .",
    "our results indicate that for an alloy of the same composition ( 10 at .",
    "% al ) and for the same range of relative temperature ( @xmath71 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 mj / m@xmath1 while @xmath14 ranges from @xmath75 mj / m@xmath1 to @xmath76 mj / m@xmath1 .",
    "these values of @xmath10 are within a factor of 2 relative to experimental results , while our estimates of the difference @xmath70 are comparable .",
    "an important finding is that for a substantial portion of the region of solid solubility of al in ti , the dapb energies @xmath9 are larger than @xmath77 mj / m@xmath1 , values which have been quoted @xcite as the thresholds above which transitions from homogenous to planar slip occur in fcc - based cu - zn , cu - al , and cu - mn alloys .",
    "this result supports the proposition that the presence of sro contributes to the predominantly planar slip in ti - al @xcite .",
    "the fact that prism and basal dapb have an almost identical energy is again consistent with a simple bond - breaking picture . despite the small anisotropy in the average dapb energies ,",
    "the behavior of each type of dapb under stress may differ .",
    "the local dapb energy density may very well fluctuate as we move along the interface .",
    "for instance , a prism dapb may contain portions that are locally analogous to a low energy prism i apb and portions that are locally similar to a high energy prism ii apb , while such fluctuations should be much smaller in basal dapb where only one type of local order exists .",
    "the average dapb energy we compute is the quantity of interest in order to determine , for instance , the total work required to deform the material by a given amount .",
    "however , for properties such as the critical resolved shear stress ( crss ) , the average may not provide enough information . a more detailed investigation of the spatial fluctuations in dapb energy density would be needed , a topic we leave for future research .",
    "our calculated @xmath68 are of the same order of magnitude as earlier theoretical studies which focused on fcc alloys @xcite .",
    "one notable qualitative distinction is the fact that , in hcp ti - al alloys , the second dislocation restores the original state of short - range order to a greater extent than in these fcc alloys , as can be seen by the larger drop between @xmath9 and @xmath78 .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that , in all the fcc alloys studied , the thermodynamically stable ordered phase in the vicinity of the short - range ordered region is a do@xmath79 structure . due to the tetragonal symmetry of this phase , different short - range ordered domains can have distinct orientations . since the dapb cuts through these different domains and since the do@xmath79 has different periodicity in different directions , it is impossible for the second dislocation to restore the local order in all domains simultaneously .",
    "in contrast , in the case of ti - al , the hcp - based do@xmath2 structure has the same periodicity along any @xmath21 $ ] direction and it follows that the second dislocation can partially restore the original local order in all domains simultaneously .",
    "our first main result is the confirmation , on the basis of first - principles calculations , that do@xmath2-type short - range is present in the hcp @xmath4-ti phase of the ti - al alloy .",
    "we have also calculated the energy of diffuse anti - phase boundaries ( dapb ) .",
    "we find that for an alloy at a composition of 10 at .",
    "% of al and a temperature between 600 and 300@xmath69c , a single dislocation creates a dapb with an interfacial energy ranging from @xmath80 to @xmath81 mj / m@xmath1 while a second dislocation creates a dapb having an interfacial energy of @xmath82 mj / m@xmath1 .",
    "these values are significantly higher than @xmath83 mj / m@xmath1 , a value estimated to be sufficient to induce a transition from homogeneous to planar slip in fcc - based alloys @xcite .    the computer programs used to complete this work can be obtained by contacting the authors .",
