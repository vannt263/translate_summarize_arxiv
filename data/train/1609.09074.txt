    "since the discovery of 51 peg b @xcite , the radial velocity ( rv ) technique has proven indispensable for exoplanet discovery .",
    "hundreds of exoplanets have been revealed by measuring the doppler wobble of the exoplanet host star @xcite , principally at visible wavelengths .",
    "to first order , the rv method yields the period and the minimum mass ( @xmath3 ) of the orbiting planet . in order to complete the characterization of a given exoplanet",
    ", one would want to measure its radius and constrain its atmospheric constituents . traditionally , this information is accessible only if the planet transits its host star with respect to our line of sight via transmission or secondary eclipse photometry .",
    "successes with these techniques have resulted in the detections of water , carbon monoxide , and methane on the hottest transiting gas giants @xcite .",
    "these gas giants orbit their host stars in days , are known as hot jupiters , and have an occurence rate of only 1@xmath4 in the exoplanet population @xcite .",
    "broadband spectroscopic measurements of transiting hot jupiter atmospheres are rarely able to resolve molecular bands , let alone individual lines , creating degeneracies in the solutions for atmospheric molecular abundances .",
    "high - resolution infrared spectroscopy has recently provided another route to the study of exoplanet atmospheres , one applicable to transiting and non - transiting planets alike .",
    "such studies capitalize on the doppler shift between the stellar and planet lines , allowing them to determine the atmosphere compositions , true masses , and inclinations of various systems . with the cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires ) at the vlt , @xcite provided a proof - of - concept of this technique and detected carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of the transiting exoplanet hd 209458 b consistent with previous detections using hubble space telescope data @xcite . by detecting the radial velocity variation of a planet s atmospheric lines in about six hours of observations on single nights , further work has detected the dayside and nightside thermal spectra of various transiting and non - transiting hot jupiters , reporting detections of water and carbon monoxide , as well as the presence of winds and measurements of the length of day @xcite . with harps , @xcite recently observed the reflected light spectrum of 51 peg b in a similar manner , combining 12.5 hours of data taken over seven nights when the full dayside of the planet was observable .",
    "@xcite studied the hot jupiter tau boo b using keck nirspec ( near infrared spectrometer ) , confirmed the crires measurement of the planet s keplerian orbital velocity , and detected water vapor in the atmosphere of a non - transiting exoplanet for the first time .",
    "nirspec was used to observe an exoplanet s emission spectrum over @xmath52 - 3 hours each night across multiple epochs , in order to capture snapshots of the planet s line - of - sight motion at distinct orbital phases . in combination with",
    "the many orders of data provided by nirspec s cross dispersed echelle format and the multitude of hot jupiter emission lines in the infrared , @xcite achieved sufficient signal - to - noise to reveal the orbital properties of tau boo b via the doppler shifting of water vapor lines in its atmosphere .    here , we continue our keck nirspec direct detection program with a study of the emission spectrum of the hot gas giant hd 88133 b , a system that allows us to test the brightness limits of this method and develop a more robust orbital dynamics model that can be applied to eccentric systems . in section  [ rvs ]",

    "it is this value of @xmath103 that we use to calculate the secondary velocity curve shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "the peak near @xmath103 = 40 km / s is consistent between the two planet models cross - correlated with the data . here , given the full suite of data , we calculate error bars on the individual points with jackknife sampling . one night s worth of data is removed from the sample and the maximum likelihood calculation is repeated .",
    "the standard deviation of each point amongst the resulting eight maximum likelihood curves is proportional to the error bars on each point on the maximum likelihood curve .",
    "we note that error bars calculated by jackknife sampling and shown in figure  [ kp ] are merely an estimate .",
    "in fact , for the gaussian fit , the reduced chi - squared value ( chi - squared divided by the number of degrees of freedom ) is 0.1 , indicating that the error bars are overestimated .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that there is high variance between jackknife samples , driving a high standard deviation and therefor large error bars . to examine this behavior",
    "further , we fit a gaussian distribution ( indicating the presence of a planetary signal ) and a flat line ( indicating no planetary signal ) and determine the significance of the signal . as in @xcite",
    ", we define the bayes factor @xmath107 to be the ratio of likelihoods between two models , in this case the likelihood of the gaussian distribution compared to the likelihood of the straight line .",
    "@xmath108 must be greater than 10 for a model to be very strongly preferred .    for the gaussian distribution",
    "compared the the straight line , @xmath108 is nearly 430 , indicating the the gaussian approximation to the signal at 40 km / s is significantly stronger than a flat line .",
    "even if our error bars are overestimated , they are likely not overestimated by a factor of 100 .",
    "combining @xmath103 with the parameters given in table  [ systemproperties ] , a @xmath103 of 40 @xmath0 15 km / s implies that the true mass of hd 88133 b is 1.02@xmath1 and its orbital inclination is 15@xmath2 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath102 implied by the most likely value of @xmath103 often , but do not always , correspond with peaks in the maximum likelihood curves for each night , as indicated by the vertical grey dashed lines in figure  [ sxcorr ] . especially for nights having a small line - of - sight velocity , planetary lines may be lost in the telluric and/or stellar cross correlation residuals .",
    "we first check our detection of hd 88133 b s emission spectrum at a @xmath103 radial velocity projection of 36 km / s by varying the spectroscopic contrast @xmath100 uniformly with orbital phase .",
    "we tested nine values of @xmath100 from 10@xmath109 to 10@xmath110 , and find the maximum likelihood peak near 40 km / s is robust for @xmath100 @xmath111 10@xmath112 .",
    "we create a  shuffled \" planetary model by randomly rearranging chunks of each planetary atmosphere model .",
    "if the maximum likelihood peak at 36 km / s is real , then cross correlating our data with a  shuffled \" planetary model ( which has no coherent planet information ) should show little to no peak at the expected @xmath103 . and ,",
    "indeed , the data-shuffled \" planetary model cross - correlation shows no peak at 40 km / s while the peak at @xmath5 60 km / s remains for the phoenix model ( see panel d of figure  [ kp ] ) .",
    "we also check our results by varying the orbital elements of the system .",
    "we obtain roughly the same values for keplerian orbital velocity ( within the error bars ) for various combinations of eccentricities down to @xmath5 0 and arguments of perihelion within 20@xmath44 of the reported value .",
    "our results are most sensitive to these orbital elements as they affect the calculations of the true anomaly and secondary velocity , and therefore the positions of the dashed vertical lines in each epoch s maximum likelihood curve shown in figure [ sxcorr ] .",
    "even with a different ephemeris , so long as the dotted vertical lines are near their current peaks , we obtain a comparable final result for the keplerian orbital velocity of the system .",
    "we note that as hd 88133 b s orbit is slightly eccentric , it is not truly tidally locked .",
    "calculations following @xcite suggest that the planet spins about 10% faster than synchronous .",
    "our strategy prefers that the planet be tidally locked so that as much of the planet s ( dayside ) emission as possible is captured when the planet has a high line - of - sight velocity relative to the star .",
    "finally , we have reprocessed the tau boo b data published by @xcite with the methods presented in section  [ methods ] .",
    "the specific departure from @xcite is the use of principal component analysis to correct for telluric features in the data ( section  [ pca ] ) .",
    "our analysis of five nights of _ l _ band data recovers a projected keplerian orbital velocity of 121 @xmath0 8 km / s , a mass of 5.39@xmath113 , and an orbital inclination of 50@xmath114 for tau boo b. this is in good agreement with @xcite ( @xmath103=111@xmath05 km / s ) as well as @xcite ( @xmath103=110@xmath03.2 km / s ) and @xcite ( @xmath103=115@xmath011 km / s ) , thereby validating our pca - based methods .",
    "the peak in log likelihood produced solely from _",
    "band data ( panel a of figure  [ kp ] ) is an order of magnitude larger than the peak produced solely from _ k _ band data , though the values of @xmath103 preferred by each data set are consistent . though the single channel signal - to - noise ratio for our data is greater in the _ k _ band than in the _",
    "l _ band , we only observe hd 88133 in _",
    "k _ for three nights and only use three orders of data in our final cross - correlation analysis whereas we observe in _",
    "l _ for six nights and use all four orders of data . furthermore , six nights of _ l _ band observations on keck yields an aggregate shot noise of @xmath5 800,000 for all epochs and all wavelength bins , suggesting that the detection of a planet having a spectroscopic contrast down to 10@xmath79 is feasible .    additionally , we attempt to detect the planet s co band near 2.295 @xmath46 m , and find that effectively separating the stellar spectrum from the planet s is a complex process .",
    "future observations should consider avoiding the co band head and focusing on the co comb ( low- to moderate- angular momentum p and r branches ) itself , particularly the regions between the stellar lines where shifted planetary co should be present .",
    "these intermediate regions have @xmath115v @xmath5 60 km / s , which is certainly sufficient for the detection of shifted planetary co and especially so given the high resolution of the next generation of cross dispersed infrared echelle spectrographs , including ishell and the upgraded crires and nirspec instruments .",
    "we took the opportunity during our reprocessing of the tau boo b data to evaluate the required accuracy of the stellar model .",
    "the original @xcite analysis was performed with a stellar spectrum using a marcs solar model with adjustments made to specific line parameters .",
    "we re - run the analysis with a phoenix model for tau boo .",
    "the correct stellar velocity at each observation epoch is still recovered and the final result for the planet s @xmath103 remains unchanged .",
    "this suggests that , for the sake of detecting the planet s spectrum and thus the planet s velocity , a detailed model of the star is not necessarily required ; however a refined stellar spectrum will be critical for learning about the planet s atmosphere in detail .",
    "acquisition of both _",
    "l _ and _ k _ band nirspec data provides a unique opportunity to constrain the atmosphere of hd 88133 b. generally , the spectroscopic contrast is dominated by water vapor in the _",
    "l _ band and by carbon monoxide and other species in the _ k _ band .",
    "ultimately , the shape of the log likelihood peak in figure  [ kp ] will provide information about the structure of the atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) and even information about the planet s rotation rate ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we do not presently consider orbital phase variations in atmosphere dynamics , radiative transfer , and the resulting spectral signatures from the day to night sides of the hot jupiter .",
    "we plan to examine detailed properties of hd 88133 b s atmosphere in a future study .",
    "we report the detection of the emission spectrum of the non - transiting exoplanet hd 88133 b using high resolution near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "this detection is based on the combined effect of thousands of narrow absorption lines , predominantly water vapor , in the planet s spectrum .",
    "we find that hd 88133 b has a keplerian orbital velocity of 40 @xmath0 15 km / s , a true mass of 1.02@xmath1 , and a nearly face - on orbital inclination of 15@xmath2 .",
    "direct detection of hot jupiter atmospheres via this approach is limited in that it can not measure the _ absolute _ strengths of molecular lines , relative to the photometric contrast .",
    "thus , this method will yield degeneracies between the vertical atmospheric temperature gradients and absolution molecular abundance ratios , but the relative abundances of species should be better constrained . for transiting planets having spitzer data",
    ", it should be possible to better measure absolute abundances by comparing spitzer eclipse depths and the output of our cross - correlation analyses using various planetary atmosphere models .    with the further refinement of this technique and with the improved future implementation of next - generation spectrometers and coronagraphs , especially on the largest optical / infrared telescopes , we are optimistic that this method may be extended to the characterization of terrestrial atmospheres at earth - like semi - major axes .",
    "this paper shows progress in that direction by presenting an algorithm capable of removing telluric lines whilst preserving planet lines even if the planet does not move significantly during the observations ."
