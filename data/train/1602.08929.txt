    "time - varying quantities , known as signals or wave - forms , are detected by monitoring a dynamical system that is affected by the signal .",
    "examples are magnetometry  @xcite , gravity - wave detection  @xcite , and accelerometry  @xcite .",
    "because the process involves a measurement on an evolving system , quantum back - action noise is an important limiting factor  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is possible , somewhat remarkably , to cancel this intrinsic noise source . beginning with unruh in 1982",
    "there have been a number of methods proposed , and some demonstrated , for canceling quantum noise over a range of frequencies  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the most recently proposed scheme for back - action noise cancellation , that by tsang and caves  @xcite .",
    "their scheme not only allows cancellation of quantum noise over all frequencies ( broadband ) , but is conceptually simple and elegant .",
    "it requires , in addition to the oscillator that detects the signal ( the `` probe '' oscillator ) , a second `` auxiliary '' oscillator that has identical properties except that it does not feel the signal and its frequency is the negative of that of the probe .",
    "the scheme works by having the measuring device coherently measure the sum of the positions of the two oscillators ( in the case of an optical oscillator the `` position '' is one of the quadratures ) . to create an oscillator with an effectively negative frequency tsang and caves ( tc ) used an optical oscillator with a frequency very much higher than that of the mechanical probe , and modulated the measurement of the optical oscillator so that , from the point of view of the measurement , it appeared to have a negative frequency .",
    "this modulation is achieved by modulating the strength of the interaction between the optical oscillator and the measuring device , and is a fairly standard `` frequency conversion '' technique that is straightforward to implement with optics .",
    "the modulation only produces the desired effect , however , if the frequency of the auxiliary , @xmath0 , is much larger than that of the probe , @xmath1 , because it generates additional terms in the output spectrum that appear at @xmath2 .",
    "these interfere with the measurement process if they overlap with the spectrum of the probe oscillator .    while elegant the scheme of tsang and caves has two drawbacks .",
    "the first is that , in order to measure the sum of the position of the probe and a quadrature of the optical oscillator a parametric amplifier must be used to engineer the required interaction with the optical oscillator .",
    "the second is that perfect noise cancellation is only achieved when the damping rates of the probe and auxiliary are the same , something that is not easy to achieve with an optical auxiliary .",
    "the drawbacks of tc noise cancellation would be eliminated if it were possible to use an auxiliary that felt the same force as the probe and had the same frequency . in that case a mechanical oscillator could be used as the auxiliary , which would eliminate the need for a parametric amplifier and make it much easier to achieve identical damping rates . here",
    "we consider how this could be done .",
    "we begin by showing that if one has the ability to directly measure any quadrature of the mechanical motion , then a small modification of the tc scheme allows one to use an auxiliary that has the same frequency and feels the same signal as the probe .",
    "this scheme is conceptually simple and makes it clear that one can perform perfect frequency conversion using a linear interaction so long as one can measure any quadrature ( any linear observable ) . by `` perfect '' frequency conversion we mean an interaction with an oscillator such that the frequency of the oscillator appears to be different from its true frequency , and without the introduction of any spurious sidebands at multiples of the latter .",
    "measuring an arbitrary quadrature of a mechanical oscillator may not be easy , however .",
    "an arbitrary mechanical quadrature is an arbitrary superposition of the position and momentum .",
    "while measuring position is straightforward , as far as we are aware there are only two methods that have to - date been proposed for making direct measurements of momentum , and neither have been demonstrated in the quantum regime .",
    "the first of these methods , by greywall  _ et al .",
    "_ , is to use the magnetic field generated by electrons , since this field is proportional to the electrons velocity  @xcite . to achieve broadband noise - cancellation",
    "our method requires that we measure a time - varying superposition of the momentum and position of one oscillator along with the position of second .",
    "an issue with the scheme of greywall  _ et al . _ is that electrical current involves dissipation , and because of this it is not obvious how to extend the scheme to measure a coherent superposition of momentum and position .",
    "the second scheme by benetov and blencowe is more recent , and involves an effective interaction with the momentum of an oscillator that can be obtained using a quantum point - contact  @xcite .",
    "while this scheme indicates that it may well be possible to make measurements of a superposition of one quadrature of one oscillator and another quadrature of another , we do not attempt to develop any specific schemes to do so here .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that such measurements could be used for all - mechanical broadband back - action - free accelerometry may provide a motivation for doing so .",
    "since techniques for the direct measurement of momentum are not yet well - developed , we also examine whether noise cancellation can be achieved with two identical mechanical oscillators and with position measurement alone .",
    "we show that this is possible if one uses two pairs of oscillators rather than a single pair , although because the frequency conversion is imperfect the scheme is restricted to narrow - band detection . by `` narrow - band detection '' we mean",
    "that the bandwidth of the force detection must be significantly less than the frequency of the mechanical oscillators .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in section",
    "[ mom ] we describe the tsang - caves scheme for back - action noise cancellation , and show that it can be performed with two identical mechanical oscillators if one has the ability to measure a time - dependent arbitrary quadrature of each oscillator . in section  [ possec ]",
    "we show how modulating a position measurement can be used to obtain a similar result , but does not allow broad - band detection . in section  [ imp ]",
    "we describe a simple opto - mechanical ( or electro - mechanical ) method for implementing the schemes presented in section  [ possec ] . in this section",
    "we also discuss the physical parameters required to beat the standard quantum limit .",
    "we finish with a brief conclusion in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we must first describe how tc noise - cancellation works . to do this all we need are the heisenberg equations of motion that describe a harmonic oscillator whose position is continuously measured .",
    "these equations are @xmath3 in which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dimensionless versions of the position and momentum of the oscillator , @xmath6 is the angular frequency of the oscillator , and @xmath7 is a quantum white noise source with correlation function @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless position and momentum are given respectively by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the annihilation operator for the oscillator .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is determined by the rate at which the measurement extracts information about the position .",
    "it is related to the noise on the stream of measurement results , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is white noise with correlation functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    to realize tc noise cancellation",
    ", we consider having two such oscillators with respective positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the second has frequency equal to @xmath20 .",
    "if we measure @xmath21 , then because we are measuring a coherent sum of the two positions , the two oscillators are driven by identical back - action noise .",
    "if we drive the positive oscillator with a force @xmath22 then the equations of motion for the two oscillators are @xmath23 if we consider @xmath24 then from the above equations we can obtain immediately @xmath25 and @xmath26 . because @xmath27 is the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and because the back - action noise is common to both , this noise cancels for the motion of @xmath27 .",
    "thus @xmath30 and @xmath27 constitute an oscillator that experiences no back - action noise , while still feeling the force @xmath22 .",
    "this is tc quantum noise cancellation .",
    "if we drive the negative oscillator with a force @xmath31 , then the noise - free oscillator feels the difference of the forces , @xmath32 .",
    "we now note that the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 also form an oscillator , in that when there are no driving forces or measurements we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "what is more , if we measure @xmath33 then @xmath29 experiences the _ negative _ of the back - action force that drives @xmath28 . because @xmath28 and @xmath29 experience opposite back - action noise , for the variable @xmath34 this noise cancels so",
    "that @xmath37 where @xmath22 is the force driving the probe and @xmath31 is that driving the auxiliary .",
    "that is , a measurement of @xmath33 realizes a back - action free measurement of the sum of the forces on the two oscillators .",
    "since we can measure the sum of two forces in this way , if both oscillators experience the same force @xmath38 we could use this method to measure this force if we had such a positive / negative pair .",
    "we could do this using two identical oscillators if we could measure them in such a way that the frequency of one of them was effectively negated .    to create an oscillator with an effectively negative frequency ,",
    "first consider making a measurement of the position @xmath4 of an oscillator with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "if we look at the dynamics in the heisenberg picture then the measured observable is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constant operators .",
    "we can cancel this time - dependence completely by instead measuring an observable that is rotating in the `` opposite direction '' at the same frequency .",
    "that is , if we measure @xmath42 then the result is a measurement of the time - independent quantity @xmath43 . taking this further , if we measure an observable rotating at @xmath44 , then an oscillator with frequency @xmath1 appears to have frequency @xmath45 .",
    "that is , the negative oscillator in eq.([m2 ] ) is equivalent to a measurement of @xmath46 on an oscillator with frequency @xmath1 . to obtain an oscillator with frequency @xmath47 from one with frequency @xmath1 we just have to measure @xmath48 .",
    "note that to do this we must be able to make a measurement of a superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the above measurement procedure performs perfect frequency conversion .",
    "but we are not quite done yet , because we need to examine how the force driving the oscillator appears in the measurement signal . in short , since the force is driving a real oscillator with frequency @xmath1 , and the measurement sees an oscillator with frequency @xmath47 , the force must appear transformed because it would produce a different signal if it were really driving a negative frequency oscillator .",
    "we can determine this transformation easily by deriving the equation of motion for @xmath48 from the equations of motion for @xmath4 and @xmath5 . by differentiating @xmath49",
    "we find that @xmath50 in which @xmath51 the effective negative oscillator is thus driven by a transformed version of the force .",
    "we need to see how the force appears in the output signal so that we can process this signal appropriately to back - out @xmath52 . to do this",
    "it is simplest to work in frequency space , and this requires that we add damping to our oscillators so that they have a well - defined steady - state .",
    "when the damping rate of an oscillator is small compared to its frequency then the usual linear frictional damping force , namely @xmath53 for some damping rate @xmath54 , transforms approximately into damping that is symmetric in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and as a result can be modeled by a simple markovian master equation  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for a positive oscillator under symmetric damping are @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are white noise sources with the correlation functions @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 is the average number of thermal phonons in the oscillator at the ambient temperature @xmath60  ^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath1 is the oscillator frequency and @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant  @xcite . ] .    by converting the above equations of motion to frequency space we can determine how the fourier transform of the force appears in the fourier transform of the position . adding driving terms to the equations of motion to give @xmath61 we find that these terms appear in the position as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total contribution of the driving terms to the fourier transform of the oscillator position , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the fourier transforms of the driving terms , and we have defined @xmath66    applying the above result to the oscillator given by eqs.([effneg1 ] ) and ( [ effneg2 ] ) we find that the force appears in the position @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and we have used the fact that @xmath70    to obtain noise cancellation we need to measure a sum of @xmath67 and the coordinate @xmath4 for a positive oscillator with frequency @xmath1 . since we do not need to perform any frequency conversion for this measurement , the force appears in the signal of the measurement of @xmath4 as @xmath71 adding the signals in eqs.([ysig ] ) and ( [ xsig ] ) together to give @xmath72 the combined output signal is @xmath73 the measured signal therefore contains components of the force spectrum at three different frequencies",
    ". there are various ways that we can extract the force from this signal .",
    "we first note that if we substitute @xmath74 into @xmath75 we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are functions of @xmath80 and we have defined @xmath81 . the above expression is a recursion relation for @xmath82 . since the transfer function of the oscillators has a width of @xmath54 and scales as @xmath83 for @xmath84 , the contribution of a term containing @xmath85 decreases approximately as @xmath86 .",
    "we can therefore use the above recursion relation and truncate it at a value of @xmath87 that gives the desired accuracy .",
    "a much neater expression for the force can be obtained by using a second pair of oscillators identical to the first pair except that instead of measuring @xmath88 for the second oscillator we measure the observable that lags ( or leads ) @xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "that is , we measure @xmath90 which gives the output signal @xmath91 adding together the signals @xmath75 and @xmath92 we have @xmath93 which provides the simple recursion relation @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 the resulting exact expression for the force is @xmath97 each subsequent term in the sum makes a smaller contribution to @xmath82 , so the sum can be truncated when sufficient accuracy is achieved .",
    "we now examine how close we can get to the above noise cancellation scheme if we are limited to position measurements alone .",
    "this means that the interaction with each of the mechanical oscillators is restricted to the form @xmath98 where @xmath4 is the mechanical position , @xmath99 is a quadrature of the probe oscillator , and @xmath100 is a rate constant .",
    "given this interaction it is well - known that we can still perform an approximate frequency conversion by modulating the interaction rate @xmath100 ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "let us modulate the coupling as @xmath101 t ) + \\cos([\\omega_a + \\nu - \\omega]t ) \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the frequency of the probe oscillator , @xmath1 is the that of the mechanical oscillator , and @xmath6 is the frequency that wish the mechanical oscillator to appear to have .",
    "we will assume that the probe oscillator is optical and thus has a much greater frequency that the mechanics .",
    "if we denote the annihilation operator for the probe by @xmath11 so that @xmath103 and that of the mechanical oscillator by @xmath104 , and move into the interaction picture with respect to both oscillators , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath105   \\nonumber \\\\                                       & + & \\hbar \\lambda_0 a [ x \\cos([\\omega-2\\nu ] t ) + p \\sin([\\omega-2\\nu ] t ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with some additional terms that oscillate at the much higher frequency @xmath102 . in the first interaction term the mechanical oscillator appears to be rotating at frequency @xmath6 instead of frequency @xmath1 , and if this were the only interaction term we would have perfect frequency conversion . in the second interaction term",
    "the mechanical oscillator appears to be oscillating at @xmath106 .",
    "this second term will in general interfere with our noise cancellation scheme .",
    "it produces a signal in the output of the probe that is shifted from that of the first by @xmath107 , and will also generate back - action noise driving the mechanics that is shifted up by this frequency .",
    "the additional fictitious oscillator at @xmath107 ceases to be a problem if its spectrum is well - separated from the spectrum of the fictitious oscillator with frequency @xmath6 .",
    "this will be the case if the bandwidth of the mechanics , which is essentially the mechanical damping rate , as well as the frequency @xmath6 are both much less than @xmath108 .",
    "thus the modulation scheme for performing approximate frequency conversion will allow us to construct a back - action cancellation scheme if the bandwidth we wish to measure is small compared to the mechanical frequency @xmath1 .    in the cancellation scheme above we started with two mechanical oscillators with frequency @xmath1 and used a measurement of a quadrature rotating at @xmath109 to obtain a oscillator with effective frequency @xmath47 .",
    "now using our modulated position measurement the frequency of the effective oscillator that we produce , @xmath6 , must be considerably smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore start with two oscillators at frequency @xmath1 and use the modulation technique to give one of them an effective frequency of @xmath6 and the other an effective frequency of @xmath20 .",
    "this gives us the required positive / negative pair .",
    "because the bandwidth @xmath54 passed by the mechanical oscillators is much smaller than its central frequency @xmath1 the positive and negative parts of the spectrum of the oscillator ( the spectrum of the motion of the oscillator s position coordinate ) are well - separated and can be treated separately when considering transformations on this spectrum .",
    "recall that the negative frequency part of the fourier transform , @xmath82 , of a real signal is the complex conjugate of the positive part : @xmath110 .",
    "the fact that the positive and negative parts are initially well - separated provides some simplification in the analysis ; a measurement that shifts the frequency of an oscillator from @xmath1 down to @xmath6 shifts the positive part of the fourier transform of its motion down from @xmath1 to @xmath6 and the negative frequency part up from @xmath47 to @xmath20 .",
    "we will denote the positive part of a fourier transform @xmath82 by adding the superscript `` pos '' to give @xmath111 .",
    "we now use the modulation method above to measure two mechanical oscillators with frequency @xmath1 so that they appear to have , respectively , the frequencies @xmath45 . the effective equations of motion for these oscillators , minus the damping and quantum back - action , are then @xmath112 with @xmath113 . to obtain quantum noise cancellation we measure the observable @xmath114 and the force appears in the positive frequency part of this signal as    @xmath115}{2 g(\\omega ) }   \\bigl [ f^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize pos}}}(\\omega + [ \\nu - \\omega ] ) + f^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize neg}}}(\\omega - [ \\nu + \\omega ] ) + f^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize pos}}}(\\omega + [ \\nu + \\omega ] ) + f^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize neg}}}(\\omega - [ \\nu - \\omega ] ) \\bigr ]   ,   \\label{eqzfnarr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 .",
    "the negative part of the spectrum of the force , @xmath117 , appears here for the following reason .",
    "the modulation that generates the effective positive oscillator with frequency @xmath118 shifts the positive frequency part of the force down from @xmath119 to @xmath118 and the negative part from @xmath47 to @xmath20 . however , the modulation that generates the effective negative oscillator moves the negative part sitting at @xmath47 up to @xmath118 , and similarly the positive part at @xmath119 down to @xmath20 .",
    "thus a contribution from the negative part of the force spectrum appears in the positive part of the output signal , and vice versa .",
    "we can now distinguish two cases .",
    "if we chose the bandwidth of the oscillators so that it is much smaller than @xmath6 , then the spectrum centered at @xmath20 does not overlap with that which is centered at @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the spectrum centered at @xmath20 does not encroach on the positive part , and so the last two terms in the above expression for @xmath121 drop out .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show the spectrum of the signal coming from the positive oscillator and in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the spectrum coming from the negative oscillator .",

    "we can do this , as we did in the previous section , by having another pair of oscillators in which we measure quadratures that are out of phase with @xmath128 by @xmath89 .",
    "the result of changing the phase of the measured observables is that a different linear combination of the positive and negative spectra appear in the output signal , due to the fact that we are changing the phase relationship between the force and the effective oscillators .",

    "b ) the hump on the left is the same hump as that on the right in ( a ) , and vice versa .",
    "since each hump is not symmetric , we have drawn the right and left sides of the hump that comes from @xmath133 with black and grey solid lines , respectively .",

    "while we have not presented a method to make such momentum measurements , this result provides a motivation for doing so .",
    "at least as far as we have been able to determine , it is not possible to achieve broadband detection with two identical oscillators if one only has position measurement at ones disposal .",
    "the reason for this is that one can not then measure an arbitrary quadrature of the mechanics , and as a result an attempt to perform frequency conversion  required to create an oscillator with an effectively negative frequency  introduces additional noise in various places in the spectrum .",
    "we have shown that it is nevertheless possible to use two identical mechanical oscillators to make back - action free measurements for a narrow band of frequencies about the mechanical frequency .",
    "this is possible because modulating a position measurement allows one to realize approximate frequency conversion for a bandwidth that is small compared to the mechanical frequency .",
