    "briley et al . ( 1994 ) and kraft ( 1994 ) have reviewed the observational data on variations in the abundances of c , n , o , na , and al in globular cluster red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars . the variations in na and al are particularly significant , since they have long been regarded as one of the principal arguments in favor of a primordial origin for the abundance anomalies ( see e.g. , cottrell & da costa 1981 ) .",
    "star - to - star variations of na were first observed by cohen ( 1978 ) and peterson ( 1980 ) in m13 and m3 , while similar variations of al , which are correlated with the cn band strength , were found by norris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) in ngc 6752 . since these original observations ,",
    "numerous other groups have confirmed the general existence of na and al vs. n correlations and na and al vs. o anticorrelations in globular cluster red giants ( drake et al .",
    "1992 ; kraft et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "recently norris & da costa ( 1995 ) have concluded that na variations exist in all clusters , while al variations are greater in the more metal - poor clusters .    except for the modest alterations due to the first dredge - up",
    ", canonical stellar evolution models predict no changes in the c , n , o , na , and al surface abundances during the rgb phase . in an attempt to explain this discrepancy between the predicted and observed abundance variations , sweigart & mengel ( 1979 ; hereafter , sm79 ) suggested that meridional circulation currents , driven by internal rotation , might be able to mix material across the radiative zone that separates the top of the hydrogen shell ( h shell ) from the base of the convective envelope in canonical rgb models .",
    "they found that there was a region of significant extent just above the h shell within which the cn cycle has processed c into n and , somewhat closer to the shell , there was a region within which the on cycle has processed o into n. the mixing was postulated to begin at the point along the rgb where the h shell burns through the hydrogen discontinuity that was previously produced by the deep penetration of the convective envelope during the first dredge - up .",
    "a progressive depletion of carbon is seen along the giant branch in m92 , m15 , and ngc 6397 ( bell , dickens , & gustafsson 1979 ; carbon et al .",
    "1982 ; trefzger et al . 1983 ; briley et al . 1990 ) , although the luminosity at which this depletion begins is uncertain , for observational reasons .",
    "if na and al were also manufactured in the cn- and on - processed regions , then mixing might also explain the observed na and al variations .",
    "complimenting the sm79 hypothesis , denisenkov & denisenkova ( 1990 ; hereafter , dd90 ) have suggested @xmath1na can be produced from proton captures on @xmath2ne in the on - processed region and that the rotation rate required by sm79 is sufficient to reconcile the observations with theory .",
    "expanding on the concepts of sm79 and dd90 , langer , hoffman , & sneden ( 1993 ; hereafter , lhs93 ; see also langer & hoffman 1995 and denissenkov & weiss ( 1996 ) ) examine the production of na and al in rgb stars by following the reactions of the relevant nuclei in a simplified model with a low metallicity ( z = 0.0001 or [ fe / h ] = -2.3 ) and a constant temperature ( t@xmath3 = 0.040 where t@xmath3 = t/10@xmath4k ) and density ( @xmath5 = 44.7 g @xmath6 ) .",
    "their study shows a significant enhancement of @xmath1na in the on - processed region which derives from a series of proton captures on @xmath7ne in the nena cycle .",
    "furthermore , their model yields an increase in @xmath0al which is made from proton captures on both @xmath8 mg and @xmath9 mg via the reactions @xmath8mg@xmath10al@xmath11mg@xmath12al .",
    "their study also shows that a mgal cycle is set up after 1.7 myr .",
    "this cycle begins with a proton capture on @xmath13 mg , which is itself enhanced through leakage from the nena cycle by a @xmath14 reaction with @xmath1na , and is completed with @xmath0al@xmath15 mg . both the nena and mgal cycles are depicted graphically in figure 1 .",
    "the purpose of this @xmath16 is to develop the work of lhs93 further by using detailed stellar evolutionary sequences to examine the production of na and al around the h shell in rgb stars .",
    "this represents an improvement over lhs93 because : 1 ) we incorporate the latest reaction rates in our burning code , 2 ) we explore a wider parameter space in both metallicity and luminosity , and 3 ) our more realistic rgb models take into account the variation in temperature and density around the h shell and incorporate the timescale for the nuclear processing to produce na and al , as set by the rate at which the h shell moves outward in mass . the na and al produced in this fashion can then be mixed outward into the envelope over the relevant timescale for the mixing process .",
    "section 2 summarizes our numerical techniques and input physics while section 3 presents the results of our calculations for some representative cases .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of our results in section 4 .",
    "in this @xmath16 we present results for two rgb sequences , one with mass m = 0.795 m@xmath17 and scaled - solar metallicity z = 0.0001 , and one with m = 0.875 m@xmath17 and z = 0.004 .",
    "each of these sequences was evolved from the zero - age main sequence up the giant branch to the onset of the helium flash .",
    "the masses were chosen to give an age of 15 gyr at the helium flash .",
    "we began our calculation of the abundance distributions around the h shell at the point on the rgb where the h shell burns through the hydrogen discontinuity produced during the first dredge - up .",
    "this occurs at a luminosity of log(@xmath18 ) = 2.28 and 1.72 in the low and high metallicity sequences , respectively .",
    "above this luminosity , mixing into the nuclearly processed region at the top of the h shell is no longer hindered by a gradient in the mean molecular weight .",
    "calculations of the abundance distributions were carried out in increments of 0.005 m@xmath17 in the helium - core mass until the models reached the helium flash .",
    "typical temperatures and densities within the nuclearly processed region were in the range from 0.015 @xmath19 t@xmath20 0.06 and 0.3 @xmath19 log@xmath21 2.5 .",
    "our nuclear reaction network code was kindly supplied to us by dr .",
    "david arnett .",
    "the majority of the reaction rates are taken from caughlin & fowler ( 1988 ; hereafter , cf88 ) .",
    "when available , we include the more recent rates for the nena and mgal cycles as reviewed by arnould , mowlavi , & champagne ( 1995 ; hereafter , amc95 ) .",
    "in particular , we include the latest results for the ne and na proton capture rates by el eid & champagne ( 1995 ) .",
    "the mg and al proton capture rates are obtained from iliadis et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and champagne , brown , & sherr ( 1993 ) . amc95",
    "re - evaluate the @xmath0al proton capture decay paths and find , contrary to the results of timmermann et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and champagne et al .",
    "( 1988 ) but in agreement with cf88 , that the @xmath22-decay channel is stronger than the @xmath23-decay channel , so that the mgal reaction rates do , in fact , lead to cycling .",
    "the network code requires a run of temperature and density , which are given by the models , and a timestep , which we supply using the stationary shell approximation ( see e.g. sweigart 1994 ) .",
    "this approximation shows excellent agreement with the conventional solution of the differential equations for the cno reactions ( clayton 1983 ) and will be discussed more fully in a future publication .",
    "the initial abundances for the main cno isotopes outside the h shell are obtained from the rgb models .",
    "we input the initial values for the other elements from @xmath24f to @xmath25ca according to their scaled solar values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the elemental profiles around the h shell of the low metallicity sequence at the start of mixing and at the onset of the helium flash .",
    "panels a and b clearly demonstrate the initial rise in @xmath1na from @xmath2ne throughout a region above the h shell , as predicted by dd90 , followed by the cycling of @xmath7ne into @xmath1na somewhat closer to the shell , as discussed by lhs93 .",
    "this rise in @xmath1na occurs within the region of c depletion which extends out to @xmath26 = 0.0040 and 0.0015 in panels a and b , respectively .",
    "the lower panels highlight the mgal cycle . as one progresses inward toward the h shell in panel c , @xmath9al",
    "is produced first from @xmath8 mg and then converted into @xmath0al through the paths shown in figure 1 . with advancement up the rgb , some @xmath0al",
    "is eventually destroyed via @xmath0al@xmath15 mg . by the tip of the rgb",
    ", the nena cycle ( panel b ) is leaking heavily into the mgal cycle and producing sizable enhancements in @xmath0al just above the h shell ( panel d ) .",
    "this huge increase in @xmath0al happens during the last 15% of the rgb lifetime , possibly allowing enough time for mixing to the surface .",
    "for comparison , figure 3 shows the same abundance profiles for the m = 0.875 m@xmath17 , z = 0.004 sequence .",
    "since the temperature around the h shell is lower in this sequence , the changes in the abundances are less dramatic throughout the evolution up the rgb , when compared to the low metallicity sequence .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath1na is still enhanced in a region above the shell , especially at the start of mixing ( panel a ) .",
    "significant production of @xmath0al , however , is only seen in panel d and even then only within the h shell . a similar decrease in the extent of the cn- and on - processed regions in rgb models of higher metallicities",
    "was found by sm79 .",
    "thus mixing in more metal - rich globular cluster giants should have less effect on the surface abundances , especially in the case of al .",
    "some of these rough estimates seem to be confirmed by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) , who note that the @xmath27 cen giants with low [ fe / h ] show a greater production of al relative to na .      in order to study the effects of using updated reaction rates",
    ", we recalculated our profiles using the older cf88 rates .",
    "these are plotted in figure 4 for the low metallicity sequence .",
    "the patterns indicative of nena and mgal cycling are clearly visible .",
    "the most notable difference from the previous results is in the enhancement of @xmath0al at the onset of the helium flash . with the cf88 rates ( figure 4d ) , the increase of @xmath0al at the center of the h shell is a factor of two lower than with the newer rates ( figure 2d ) .",
    "further , the large increases in al only occur during the last 5% of the rgb lifetime . with the cf88 rates ,",
    "the nena cycle does not leak as heavily into the mgal cycle , resulting in a larger build - up of @xmath1na ( figure 4b vs. figure 2b ) and a smaller enhancement of @xmath13 mg .",
    "this effect is offset , however , by the fact that the region of @xmath1na enhancement extends further above the h shell with the new rates . since mixing",
    "is postulated to occur only above the h shell , one expect the more modern rates to increase the predicted surface abundances of na and al .",
    "by combining our realistic stellar models with an updated nuclear reaction network , we are able to follow the nucleosynthesis of c , n , o , ne , na , mg , and al around the h shell of two sequences of differing metallicity as they evolve up the rgb . in qualitative agreement with the observations ,",
    "our results show an increase in @xmath1na above the h shell throughout the entire giant branch , independent of metallicity .",
    "furthermore , we produce sizable enhancements of @xmath0al for the low metallicity sequence as it approaches the tip of the rgb , without having to increase the initial @xmath28 mg abundance or the @xmath9 mg proton capture rate as in langer & hoffman ( 1995 ) .",
    "thus , our results can potentially reconcile the na and al abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster giants with the mixing of these elements from the stellar interior .",
    "although our work is based on up - to - date reaction rates , those rates can still be quite uncertain in some cases .",
    "for example , our results deviate from the observations in the case of @xmath13 mg .",
    "contrary to the findings of shetrone ( 1996 ) , who observes a decrease in @xmath13 mg with increasing luminosity in m13 giants , we show an enhancement of @xmath13 mg with continuing evolution for the low metallicity sequence .",
    "however , the high metallicity sequence shows only a marginal increase in the @xmath13 mg abundance .",
    "thus , our present inability to qualitatively reproduce the @xmath13 mg observations might be due to the current uncertainty in the nuclear cross - sections .",
    "perhaps a faster rate for the @xmath13mg@xmath29al reaction or a slower rate for the @xmath0al@xmath15 mg reaction would decrease the @xmath13 mg abundance .",
    "figures 2 and 4 show how the @xmath13 mg abundance can depend on the choice of reaction rates .",
    "in addition to depending on the accuracy of the nuclear reaction rates , any final predictions of surface abundances will also depend strongly on the choice of a mixing mechanism .",
    "the mixing timescale , the depth of the mixing , and the dependence on metallicity will all affect the quantitative results for the surface abundances . in a future paper",
    ", we will explore these aspects of the mixing mechanism and will compare the predicted variations of the surface abundances along the rgb with the observational constraints .    in order to better understand the effects of metallicity",
    ", we will also extend the present work to a population i red giant .",
    "furthermore , we will use the same set of sequences to study the cno isotopes .",
    "finally , we intend to follow the production and destruction of @xmath30he along the rgb in order to determine better how low mass stars affect the chemical evolution of this isotope in the galaxy .",
