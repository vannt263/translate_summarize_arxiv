    "quantum hall effect ( qhe ) keeps catching researchers attention owing to its peculiar features mainly related to quantum coherence and the emergence of a new class of particles called `` composite fermions '' , due to collective behavior shared with superconductivity and bose - einstein condensation phenomena .",
    "in fact , the physics of the bilayer quantum hall ( blqh ) systems , made by trapping electrons in two thin layers at the interface of semiconductors , is quite rich owing to unique effects originating in the intralayer and interlayer coherence developed by the interplay between the spin and the layer ( pseudospin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the presence of interlayer coherence in bilayer quantum hall states has been examined by magnetotransport experiments @xcite , where electrons are transferable between the two layers by applying bias voltages and the interlayer phase difference is tuned by tilting the sample . also , anomalous ( josephson - like ) tunneling current between the two layers at zero bias voltage",
    "were predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite , whose first experimental indication was obtained in ref .",
    "other original studies on spontaneous interlayer coherence in blqh systems are @xcite .",
    "spin and pseudospin quantum degrees of freedom are correlated in blqh systems and entanglement properties have also been studied in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , mainly at filling factor @xmath3 . an appropriate description of quantum correlations is of great relevance in quantum computation and information theory , a field which has also attracted a huge degree of attention .",
    "actually , one can find quantum computation proposals using blqh systems in , for example , @xcite . in this article",
    "we also address the interesting problem of quantum coherence and entanglement in blqh systems at fractions of @xmath4 ( perhaps a less known case ) , in the hope that our theoretical considerations contribute to eventually implement feasible large scale quantum computing in blqh systems by engineering quantum hall states . for this purpose , controllable entanglement ,",
    "robustness of qubits ( long decoherence time ) and ease qubit measurement are crucial . concerning qubit measurement ( and general reconstruction of quantum states ) , coherent states ( which are often said to be the most classical of all states of a dynamical quantum system ) have been widely used to reconstruct the quantum state of light @xcite , pure spin sates @xcite , etc , by using tomographic , spectroscopic , interferometric , etc , techniques . the existence of interlayer and intralayer coherence in blqh systems has also been evidenced ( as commented in the previous paragraph ) , and we think that is its worth studying coherent states ( cs in the following ) for the `` grassmannian '' @xmath5 case , which is perhaps less known than the `` complex projective '' ( totally symmetric ) @xmath6 case .",
    "the subject of cs is not only important for the quantum state reconstruction problem , but also to analyze the phase diagram of hamiltonian models undergoing a quantum phase transition ( like the well studied spin - ferromagnet and pseudo - spin - ferromagnet phases at @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is the spirit of gilmore s algorithm @xcite , which makes use of cs as variational states to approximate the ground state energy , to study the classical , thermodynamic or mean - field , limit of some critical quantum models and their phase diagrams .",
    "for the blqh system at @xmath4 , the variational ground state energy per landau site ( with a hamiltonian consisting on coulomb plus zeeman - pseudo - zeeman terms ) has been analyzed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the variational , @xmath7-invariant , ground state is a homogeneous ( coherent ) state parametrized by eight independent variables [ or four complex parameters @xmath8 , in our notation ; see later on equations ( [ cs1],[cs11 ] ) ] which are related to the eight so - called goldston modes in the @xmath7-invariant system",
    ". minimizing the variational ground state energy within this parameter space ( eight - dimensional energy surface ) reveals the existence of three phases at @xmath4 : spin , ppin and canted phases ( see e.g. @xcite ) as we move through the blqh hamiltonian coupling constants ( bias voltage , tunneling , zeeman strength , etc ) . at the minimum",
    ", the eight coherent ( ground ) state parameters now depend on these hamiltonian coupling constants and we could manipulate them to generate not only specific cs but also interesting combinations like the so - called schrdinger cat states . the existence of schrdinger cat states has been evidenced in other physical models undergoing a quantum phase transition like the dicke model for atom - radiation interaction ( see e.g. @xcite ) and vibron models for molecules @xcite , among others .",
    "in this paper we provide explicit expressions of cs for blqh at general fractions of @xmath4 and we study some physical properties like interlayer imbalance and entanglement and their fluctuations .",
    "we believe that the cs discussed in this paper will also be of importance when studying many other blqh issues like the aforementioned phase diagrams .    in the blqh system ,",
    "one landau site can accommodate four isospin states @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the lowest landau level , where @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) means that the electron is in the bottom layer `` @xmath12 '' ( resp .",
    "top layer `` @xmath13 '' ) and its spin is up ( resp . down ) , and so on .",
    "therefore , the underlying group structure in each landau level of the blqh system is enlarged from spin symmetry @xmath2 to isospin symmetry @xmath1",
    ". the driving force of quantum coherence is the coulomb exchange interaction , which is described by an anisotropic @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model in blqh systems @xcite . actually , it is the interlayer exchange interaction which develops the interlayer coherence .",

    "coherent states have also been worked out in these higher - dimensional generalizations , which help to perform a semi - classical analysis and to construct effective wess - zumino - witten actions for the edge states .",
    "similar contructions could also be done for blqh systems at @xmath5 with the help of the grassmannian cs that we discuss in this paper .",
    "two electrons in one landau site must form an antisymmetric state due to pauli exclusion principle and this leads to a 6-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath7 , which is usually divided into spin and pseudospin sectors .",
    "the composite - fermion field theory @xcite and experiments reveal the existence of new fractional qh states in the bilayer system @xcite . for fractional values of the filling factor ,",
    "@xmath5 , the composite fermion interpretation is that of two electrons pierced by @xmath0 magnetic flux lines .",
    "the mathematical structure of the @xmath26-dimensional hilbert space @xmath27 for two composite particles in one landau site has been studied in a recent article @xcite by us , where we have also constructed the set of cs labeled by points of @xmath16 . for @xmath0 odd",

    "this oscillator construction somehow reminds the quasi - spin formalism introduced in the two - mode approximation of bose - einstein condensates in a double - well potential , with the role of the two wells played now by the two layers .",

    "<S> we study coherence and entanglement properties of the state space of a composite bi - fermion ( two electrons pierced by @xmath0 magnetic flux lines ) at one landau site of a bilayer quantum hall system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , interlayer imbalance and entanglement ( and its fluctuations ) are analyzed for a set of @xmath1 coherent ( _ quasiclassical _ ) states generalizing the standard pseudospin @xmath2 coherent states for the spin - frozen case . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom opens new possibilities with regard to the spin - frozen case . </S>",
    "<S> actually , spin degrees of freedom make interlayer entanglement more effective and robust under perturbations than in the spin - frozen situation , mainly for a large number of flux quanta @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> interlayer entanglement of an equilibrium thermal state and its dependence with temperature and bias voltage is also studied for a pseudo - zeeman interaction . </S>"
