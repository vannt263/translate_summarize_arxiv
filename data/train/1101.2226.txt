    "the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is a phenomena of great interest in the scientific community . in 1957 , ginzburg @xcite considered that the coexistence could exist if the critical field were longer that the induction created by the magnetization .",
    "two years before the antagonic nature of superconductivity and magnetism was confirmed when matthias experiments @xcite showed that the superconductivity in lanthanum was destroyed by a small concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "this was explained as in conventional _",
    "s_-wave superconductors , local magnetic moments break up spin singlet cooper pairs and hence strongly suppress superconductivity , an effect known as magnetic pair - breaking . because of the pair - breaking effect , in most superconductors the presence of only a 1% level of magnetic impurity can result in the almost complete destruction of the superconducting behavior .",
    "the discovery of rare earth ternary and actinide compounds was the first opportunity to study the interaction between the magnetic moments of _ f_-electrons and superconducting electrons in a very high density of local moments @xcite .",
    "these compounds presented new exotic phenomena associated with the long - range order of local magnetic moments , such as reentrant superconductivity @xcite , coexistence of superconductivity and ferro - antiferromagnetism @xcite , magnetic field inducing superconductivity @xcite and heavy fermion superconductivity @xcite .",

    "fujimori , et al .",
    "@xcite have presented a study related to the superconducting and normal properties ; they studied the resistivity , heat capacity , upper critical magnetic field , in polycrystals and needle like single crystals .    among the electronic characteristics of this intermetallic alloy",
    "is that it presents a large phonon resistivity due to predominant coupling of electrons by bismuth vibrations via the ni vibrations . in this study",
    "we are mainly concerned with the magnetic - superconducting interacting effects , as we will discussed in the rest of the paper .",
    "several samples were studied . the preparation method for the most pure obtained sample",
    "was the following : the nibi@xmath0 composition was prepared by solid state method using bi pieces ( aldrich 99.999 % ) and ni powder ( strem chemicals 99.9 % ) in evacuated quartz tubes .",
    "the samples were melted in a resistance furnace at @xmath10 c for seven days .",
    "the characterization was made by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) ( bruker axs d8 advance ) using cu k@xmath11 radiation , scanning electron microscopy ( sem - eds ) ( leica - cambridge ) , and x -ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) ( microtech multilab esca2000 ) using al k@xmath11 radiation 1453.6 ev .",

    "the peak binding energy ( be ) positions were referenced to au 4f@xmath16 at 84.00 ev and ag 3d@xmath17 at 367.30 ev having a fwhm of 1.02 ev .",
    "magnetization measurements and determination of the superconducting properties were performed using a quantum design ( qd ) superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) mpms system .",
    "we determined the transition temperature with magnetization versus temperature m(t ) measurements with a small magnetic field about 10 oe .",
    "two normal distinct measuring modes were used , zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) .",
    "critical magnetic fields were determined by performing isothermal measurements m(h ) at different temperatures , from 2 to 4k .",
    "we also performed isothermal measurements at different magnetic intensities at higher temperatures to observe possible magnetic behavior above the transition temperature and at much higher temperatures . in order to determine the curie temperature and to discard the possibility of ni as an impurity in the compound",
    ", we performed studies to observe in the isothermal curves , m - h , the existance of hysteresis , thus the coercitive field at different temperatures , and well above the ni and nibi curie temperatures using a quatum design oven installed in the mpms .",
    "the structural characterization determined by powder xrd and rietveld refinement are shown in fig .",
    "the polycristalline phases were identified by comparison with x - ray patterns in the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) 2010 .",
    "all the peaks correspond to the nibi@xmath0 phase ( icsd 58821 ) , except the weak peaks related to impurities of bi ( icsd 64703 ) and nibi ( icsd 107493 ) , in a proportion less than 1 and 2 % respectively . according to the results of the refinement ,",

    "the inset shows the isothermal measurements at 750 k. at that temperature the ferromagnetic characteristic is still clearly observed at low fields . ]      as was mentioned before different magnetic measurements were performed to have a better insight about the electronic properties of this alloy . below the transition temperature m(h ) measurements were used to determinate the critical fields in the usual manner ; thus fitting a straight line to the m(h ) curve at different temperatures .",

    "this anomalous behavior is the indication of two competing proceses : superconductivity and ferromagnetism . at high temperature above the transition temperature , where the diamagnetic characteristic disappears , m(h )",
    "shows a typically ferromagnetic characteristic ; thus a tendency to saturation of the magnetization at high fields and a coercive field , h@xmath19 , at the central part of the curve .",
    "m(h ) mesurements were performed in order to determinate the coercive field h@xmath19 .",
    "we used a medium field model above the superconducting temperature given by : @xmath21(t ) = h@xmath22(0)[1-(t/@xmath23@xmath22)@xmath24 , in this equation @xmath23@xmath22 is the curie temperature . in fig",

    "the measurement performed at 750 k clearly indicates that nibi@xmath18 is the only magnetic contributing material . in the yoshida s studies they observed that nibi is magnetic at a maximum about 640 k. our measurements show that at 750 k the coercive field is small and about 70 oe .",
