    "it has been well - established that a certain class of @xmath0 grand unified ( gut ) models @xcite are capable of elegantly solving some of the most prominent problems with the standard model .",
    "one of the more basic yet intriguing features of these models is the ability to naturally accommodate a right - handed neutrino , consequently allowing for a well - motivated implementation of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass @xcite , a long - uncontested ansatz that dynamically explains the smallness of ( left - handed ) neutrino masses .",
    "the seesaw was originally implemented in the framework of susy @xmath0 with only the * 10 * - and * 126 * -dimensional higgs multiplets coupling to fermions @xcite ; the * 126 * vev also plays the role of breaking @xmath7 and triggering the seesaw mechanism , thereby creating a deep mathematical connection between the smallness of neutrino masses and the other fermion masses .",
    "this seemingly - limited yet elegant approach yielded a realistic neutrino sector , including an accurate prediction of the value of @xmath2 @xcite , long before experiments were being done to measure its properties .",
    "this so - called `` minimal '' @xmath0 model has been explored much more thoroughly over the years by many authors with the arrival of precision measurements @xcite , and it remains a viable predictor of the neutrino sector parameters .",
    "there are however still a number of common difficulties one faces when attempting to construct a complete and realistic candidate for unification .",
    "furthermore , these difficulties are continually being made more severe by new experimental results , which typically manifest as new lower bounds on the possible existence of some proposed feature , as part of a disheartening streak of null results .. despite the excitement among experimentalists , the popularity at the time of tri - bimaximal mixing models @xcite , which prefer @xmath8 , meant the practical elimination of nearly an entire class of active @xmath0 research .",
    "see @xcite for examples of such models . ]",
    "arguably the most problematic feature common to nearly all gut models arises when one examines the lifetime of the proton . in all @xmath0 models ,",
    "heavy @xmath9-like gauge boson exchanges give rise to effective higher - dimensional operators that allow for    quark - lepton mixing and , consequently , nonzero probabilities for proton decay widths .",
    "furthermore , in susy gut models , several additional decay modes are available , as each of the gut - scale higgs superfields contains at least one colored higgs triplet that allows for proton decay through exchange of higgsino superpartners .",
    "no one yet knows whether protons do in fact decay at all ; so far , the lower limit on proton lifetime is known to be at least @xmath10 years , and the partial lifetimes for the various decay modes have been continually rising through the findings of experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , if any @xmath0 model is to be trusted , its prediction for the proton lifetime must be at least so high a number .",
    "most minimal @xmath9 models have already been virtually ruled out by such limits ( technically , a few niches of parameter space do still remain ) .",
    "there are ways in which the proton lifetime limits can be satisfied within the framework of a given @xmath0 model , but doing so typically requires substantial fine - tuning to create rather extreme cancellations ( @xmath11 ) among the mixing parameters of the color - triplet higgsinos exchanged in the decay .",
    "the values of those mixings can not so far be reasonably recognized as more than arbitary free parameters , so to expect multiple instances of very sensitive relationships among them requires putting much faith in either unknown dynamics or extremely good luck .",
    "restricting the susy vev ratio @xmath12 , conventionally parametrized as @xmath13 , to small values can provide some relief without cancellation for higgsino - mediated decay channels , but such an assumption is still ad hoc and may ultimately be inconsistent with experimental findings ; hence it is strongly preferable to construct a model which is tractable for any feasible @xmath13 .",
    "if however the gut yukawas , which are @xmath14 matrices in generation space , have some key elements naturally small or zero , then extreme cancellations can be largely avoided by eliminating most of the dominant contributions to proton decay width . a 2013 paper by dutta , mimura , and mohapatra @xcite proposed such a yukawa texture for the @xmath0 model including a * 120 * coupling in addition to the * 10 * and @xmath1 higgs contributions to fermion masses .",
    "the authors gave a tentative analysis of mainly leading - order relationships between key fermion fit parameters and proton partial lifetimes for a neutrino sector arising from a type - ii dominant seesaw mechanism ; they also provided a cursory analysis for a possible type - i solution .",
    "the work i present in this paper verifies the initial analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by @xmath15 finding a stable numerical fit to all fermion mass and mixing parameters , including the neutrino sector , where values are predictions of the model , and @xmath16 then finding adequately large lifetimes for the dominant modes of proton decay using the yukawa couplings fixed by the fermion fit .",
    "i grounded the analysis in conservative assumptions , including large @xmath13 , and a comprehensive calculation relying on as few approximations as necessary .",
    "the pertinent modes of proton decay i checked for sufficient partial lifetimes are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "i will present solutions for both type - i and ii seesaw neutrino masses .",
    "the results not only give satisfactory predictions for the neutrino sector based on corresponding charged sector fits , but also adequately predict sufficiently long - lived protons without relying on the usual large degree of cancellation .",
    "furthermore , i find that the ansatz is completely successful in satisfying the proton lifetime limits without any need for tuning in the type - i seesaw scenario , while a modest @xmath22 cancellation is still needed in the type - ii case to satisfy the partial lifetime limit of the often - problematic @xmath23 mode",
    ". this combination of type - i and ii results is precisely contrary to the tentative expectations of the authors in @xcite ; the discrepancy is due mainly to the unexpected significance of the effect of rotation to mass basis on the results of the decay width calculations , combined with the numerical details of the rotation matrices arising from the charged sector mass and ckm fit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , i give an overview of the @xmath0 superpotential and the fermion mass matrices following from it , followed by the details of the yukawa texture ansatz ; in section [ proton ] , i expand further on the model specifics and examine general gut proton - decay logistics in order to derive the needed partial decay widths ; in section [ fit ] , i present the fermion sector results of the numerical fitting to the measured masses and mixings ; in section [ pfit ] , i present the results of the calculation of the important partial lifetimes of the proton ; and in section [ conclusion ] , i discuss the implications of the results and give my conclusions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath0 model in question has * 10 * - , @xmath1- , and * 120 * -dimensional yukawa couplings contributing to fermion masses .",
    "the fields are named here as h , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "thus , the relevant superpotential terms are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the * 16 * -dimensional matter spinor containing superfields of all the sm fermions ( of one generation ) plus the right - handed neutrino , and @xmath28 is the generation index .",
    "after the gut symmetry breaking , sm - type @xmath29 doublet representations ( @xmath30 + c.c ) contained in the decompositions of h , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 mix with each other , and also with the doublets from * 126 * ( which is needed to preserve susy invariance ) and any additional fields present in the model for gut - breaking purposes but not contributing to fermion masses , such as * 210 * or * 54*. these doublets come in pairs with conjugate sm quantum numbers , and each higgs superfield contains one or two pairs .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath31 for each set of doublets is determined by the couplings and vevs of the gut - scale superpotential , and so the fields are generally expected to be heavy ; however , one pair must remain light in order to play the role of the mssm higgs doublets @xmath32 .",
    "this need requires the imposition of the fine - tuning condition @xmath33 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath34 when compared to the gut scale ) , which can be interpreted as the fixing of one parameter in the matrix , conventionally chosen to be the mass of the * 10 * , @xmath35 .",
    "this choice will have implications for proton decay analysis that i will discuss in the next section . in light of this establishment of the mssm doublets ,",
    "the effective dirac fermion mass matrices can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 takes @xmath38 for down - type fields .",
    "each coupling @xmath39 for @xmath40 is related to @xmath41 from eq.([eq : w ] ) by an absorption of the susy vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath42 and some function of elements of the unitary matrices @xmath43 that diagonalize @xmath31 .",
    "these mixings are given in detail with respect to this model in @xcite and more generally in @xcite , but those details are not relevant at this point in the discussion .",
    "the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 are similarly defined as functions of those mixings .",
    "the full neutrino mass matrix is determined by both majorana mass terms in the superpotential and the dirac mass contribution given in eq.([eq : mass ] ) .",
    "the light masses can be generally given by a combination of the type - i and type - ii seesaw mechanisms , involving the vevs of both left- and right - handed majorana terms : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the vevs of the sm - triplet @xmath48 and singlet @xmath49 in @xmath50 .",
    "the seesaw scale ( _ i.e. _ , rh - neutrino scale ) coincides with the @xmath7 breaking scale and is set by @xmath51 ; typically @xmath52 , although it is a free parameter of the model in principle .",
    "we will separately consider cases of type - ii ( @xmath53 term ) and type - i ( @xmath54 term ) dominance , which can both be readily accommodated in this model .",
    "note that the presence of the @xmath55 coupling in both terms intimately connects the neutrino mass matrix properties to those of the charged sector matrices , making the model quite predictive .",
    "also note we will consider only normal mass hierarchy in this analysis .",
    "the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath55 ( with tildes or not ) are real and symmetric , and @xmath57 is pure imaginary and anti - symmetric ; hence , the dirac fermion yukawa couplings are hermitian in general , and their most general forms can be written as @xmath58    \\tilde{g } = i \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }       0 & g_{12 } & g_{13 } \\\\      -g_{12 } & 0 & g_{23 }",
    "\\\\      -g_{13 } & -g_{23 } & 0 \\end{array}\\right ) \\label{eq : y0}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath59 is singled out to stress its dominance over all other elements .",
    "the three matrices as written have a total of 15 parameters ; taken in combination with @xmath53 as well as the vev and mixing ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the model has a total of 21 parameters . correspondingly , there are in principle 22 measurable observables , including all masses , mixing angles , and cp violating phases , associated with the physical fermions , although the three pmns phases and one neutrino mass are yet to be observed",
    ". therefore we would prefer then to have no more than 18 parameters in the model , and generally speaking fewer parameters indicates greater predictability .",
    "furthermore , as i will discuss in more detail shortly , the @xmath60 effective operators that arise in proton decay are @xmath61 ( again @xmath40 ) ; therefore , increasing the number of @xmath41 that are small or zero will increase the number of negligible or vanishing contributions to the decay width .",
    "this idea was given thorough consideration in @xcite , and the couplings suggested by the authors are as follows : @xmath62    \\tilde{g } = i \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }       0 & g_{12 } & g_{13 } \\\\",
    "-g_{12 } & 0 & g_{23 } \\\\      -g_{13 } & -g_{23 } & 0 \\end{array}\\right ) \\label{eq : y}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that @xmath63 is an explicitly rank-1 matrix , with @xmath64 ; thus , at first order , the * 10 * higgs contributes to the third generation masses and nothing more .",
    "this feature has been explored in models demonstrating a discrete flavor symmetry in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , and may therefore be dynamically motivated .",
    "taking @xmath65 is equivalent to a partial diagonalization of @xmath66 , so it can be done without loss of generality , and the restriction on @xmath67 is clearly phenomenologically motivated given the small first - generation masses . as a result of these assumptions ,",
    "the above yukawa texture should give rise to sufficient proton decay lifetimes without the need for the usual extreme cancellations .",
    "it is further preferred for proton decay that @xmath68 , although @xmath69 plays a role in setting the size of the reactor neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 , so the above restriction may create some tension in the fitting .    in carrying out the numerical minimization",
    ", i will allow @xmath67 and @xmath70 to have small but non - vanishing values , @xmath71 , for the sake of giving accurate first - generation masses without creating tension in other elements .",
    "the results of that analysis will be discussed in section [ fit ] , after i discuss the details of calculating proton decay .",
    "in addition to the the sm - doublets present in each of the gut higgs superfields , which contribute to the emergence of @xmath32 at the susy scale , the gut fields similarly contain sm - type @xmath72 _ color - triplets _ ( @xmath73 + c.c ) in their decompositions .",
    "these fields will also mix after the gut - scale breaking ( again , this mixing includes triplets contained in the higgs fields not contributing to fermion masses ) . since there is no light triplet analog to @xmath32 found in the low - scale particle spectrum , all of the fields can be heavy , although the decoupling of the doublet - triplet behavior is a substantial topic itself . the yukawa potential in eq.([eq : w ] ) leads to interactions with these fields of the forms @xmath74 and  @xmath75 , which violate baryon or lepton number .",
    "the fields @xmath76 are left - handed anti - fermion superfields .",
    "e.g. _ `` @xmath77 '' is shorthand for the @xmath29-doublet contraction @xmath78",
    ". there are similar interaction terms for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; furthermore , two more exotic types of triplets also lead to @xmath81- or @xmath82-violating vertices , @xmath83 + c.c , which interact with two up - type or two down - type rh singlet fermions , and @xmath84 + c.c , with a pair of lh doublets .",
    "exchange of conjugate pairs of any these triplets , through a mass term or interaction with a heavy higgs field such as * 54 * or * 210 * , leads to operators that change two quarks into a quark and a lepton ; this is the numerically dominant mechanism through which a proton can decay into a meson and a lepton ; corresponding s - channel decays through the scalar superpartners of these triplets , as well as s - channel decays through the @xmath9-like gauge bosons @xmath85 are suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath86 and so are generally negligible in comparison .- boson exchange , @xmath87 , may be comparable if the relevant threshold corrections are large . ] figure [ fig : susyfd ] shows feynman diagrams for two examples of the operators in question",

    "the corresponding @xmath60 superpotential is @xmath88l } u^{\\mathcal{c}\\,a}_i d^{\\mathcal{c}\\,b}_j    u^{\\mathcal{c}\\,c}_k e^\\mathcal{c}_l \\right ) , \\label{eq : effw}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 are the generation indices and @xmath90 are the color indices ; the @xmath29 doublets are contracted pairwise .",
    "this potential has @xmath91 in addition to @xmath92 and so also has @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 is a generic gut - scale mass for the triplets .",
    "note the anti - symmetrization of @xmath95 in the @xmath96 operator ; this is the non - vanishing contribution in light of the contraction of the color indices .",
    "the analogous anti - symmetry for the @xmath82 operator is ambiguous in the current notation , but i will tend to the issue shortly .",
    "the effective operator coefficients @xmath97 are of the form @xmath98 the couplings @xmath99 as written correspond to matter fields in the flavor basis and undergo unitary rotations in the change to mass basis , as indicated by the hats on @xmath100 in eq.([eq : effw ] ) above ; i will save the details of the change of basis for later in the discussion .",
    "the parameters @xmath101 are elements of the unitary matrices that diagonalize the triplet mass matrix @xmath102 , or the corresponding matrices for the exotic triplets . note that several identifications have already been made here : @xmath103 and @xmath104 ; the would - be parameters @xmath105 . also note that @xmath106 is the * 10 * mass parameter fixed by the tuning condition for @xmath107 .",
    "the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 correspond to the exotic triplets ; the indices of those terms are connected in unique ways as a result of the distinct contractions of fields",
    ".    the left - handed term in eq.([eq : effw ] ) can be further expanded by multiplying out the doublets as @xmath110l } u^a_i d^b_j u^c_k e_l -    \\widehat{c}^l_{\\{i[j\\}k]l } u^a_i d^b_j d^c_k \\mathcal{n}_l \\right ) , \\label{eq : effwl}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the left - handed neutrino superfield .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath112 are symmetrized in @xmath113 , as a result of the doublet contractions , and anti - symmetrized in the indices of the like - flavor quarks , again due to the anti - symmetry of color index contraction , as discussed above for @xmath114 .",
    "this anti - symmetry will be crucial in restricting the number of contributing channels for decay .",
    "since the symmetrizing of @xmath113 is the same for both types of left - handed operators , i will suppress its denotation in future instances to let readability favor the less trivial anti - symmetry .    ; integrating out the triplets gives an effective operator of type @xmath115 .",
    "diagram ( b ) shows a @xmath116-type operator contributing to @xmath117 .",
    "diagram ( c ) shows a @xmath118-type operator contributing to @xmath119 , for @xmath120 .",
    "note where more than one field is listed , each choice gives a separate contributing channel , except for the dependent exchange of @xmath121 in ( b ) . ]      as holomorphism of the superpotential forbids terms like @xmath122 for the scalar boson components of the triplet superfields , diagrams of the type in figure [ fig : susyfd ] can only be realized at leading order through conjugate pairs of _ higgsino _ triplet mediators .",
    "thus , in component notation , each vertex will be of the form @xmath123 or similar .",
    "therefore , the squarks and sleptons must be `` dressed '' with gaugino or ( susy ) higgsino vertices to give @xmath124 effective operators of the four - fermion form needed for proton decay .",
    "depending on the sfermions present , diagrams may in principle be dressed with gluinos , winos , binos , or higgsinos .",
    "examples of appropriately - dressed component - field diagrams which give proton decay are shown in figure [ fig : compfd ] .    in the following subsections ,",
    "i will briefly discuss the implications for each type of dressing and determine which types will contribute leading factors in the proton decay width .",
    "note that i will give this discussion in terms of @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , rather than @xmath128 and @xmath129 , because @xmath15 i will assume a universal mass spectrum for superpartners to satisfy fcnc constraints , meaning the mass and flavor eigenstates coincide for the gauge bosons , and @xmath16 the mixing of higgsinos , while not typically negligible , will result in chargino or neutralino masses different from @xmath130 by @xmath131 factors , as long as gaugino soft masses are relatively small compared to @xmath130 ; since precise values of such masses are insofar unknown , and since so many of the susy and gut parameter values needed for the decay width calculations are similarly unknown , i will take @xmath132 in order to simplify the calculation , especially for computational purposes .",
    "two limitations are readily apparent when considering dressing by gluinos .",
    "first , the lepton will have to be a fermion leg in the triplet exchange operator , as in figure [ fig : compfd ] ( b ) or ( c ) , since a slepton can not be dressed by a gluino .",
    "second , since @xmath133 interactions are generation - independent , the gluino can only take @xmath134 , @xmath135 , etc .",
    "the latter may seem a fairly innocuous idea on its own , but consider that proton decay to a kaon or pion will involve operators with one and zero second - generation quarks as external legs , respectively , with all others first - generation . taking these two points together with the generation - index anti - symmetry of the @xmath97 operators , which implies that @xmath136 for the @xmath137 operators and @xmath138 for the @xmath139 operators",
    ", one can see by inspecting a dressed diagram that only diagrams with exactly one each of @xmath140 in the triplet operator may be successfully dressed by the gluino .",
    "this constraint implies that gluino dressing can contribute only to @xmath23 decay mode ; furthermore , the absence of @xmath141-type contributions implies no right - handed channels .",
    "taking these constraints into account , and thus looking specifically at variants of the @xmath142 operator , there are three independent terms we can write @xcite , which correspond to the dressed diagrams shown in figure [ fig : gludress ] : '' is actually @xmath143 ; the details have been suppressed simply for readability . ]",
    "@xmath144 applying the gluino dressing to each term gives us the following sum of four - fermion effective operators : @xmath145 where the parameters @xmath146 contain factors from the scalar and gluino propagators in the loop integral .",
    "the scalar propagators are different in general ; however , recall that i am assuming universal sfermion mass prescription , meaning that all squark masses a equal to leading order . in that case ,",
    "all @xmath147s are equal and can be factored out of the brackets .",
    "the sum left inside the brackets is zero by a fierz identity for fermion contractions @xcite , and so the contribution from gluino dressing to the @xmath148 decay mode vanishes under the universal mass assumption .",
    "operator @xmath149l } uds\\mathcal{n}$ ] that would contribute to @xmath150 ; in the limit of universal squark masses , the three diagrams sum to zero by a fierz identity . + note : gluino mass insertions have been omitted from the diagrams for readability . ]      as with @xmath133 , @xmath151 interactions are also flavor - diagonal ; thus , the same constraints apply here as in the gluino case , and possible contributions are to the @xmath152 mode only .",
    "looking again at the @xmath142 operator , for terms in which the neutrino is a fermion leg , the argument is analogous to that given for the gluino dressing : the diagrams involved are identical to the three in figure [ fig : gludress ] except with @xmath153 ; starting again from expression ( [ eq : udsn - q ] ) and applying the bino dressing , we arrive at an expression similar to ( [ eq : gludr ] ) but containing hypercharge coefficients in addition to the @xmath146 : @xmath154 however , @xmath155 are all left - handed quarks with @xmath156 , so the hypercharge products factor out , and again the fermion sum vanishes by the fierz identity .",
    "operator @xmath157l } uds\\mathcal{n}$ ] involving a scalar neutrino that would contribute to @xmath158 ; again , in the limit of universal squark masses , the three diagrams sum to zero by a fierz identity .",
    "note : bino mass insertions have been omitted from the diagrams for readability . ]",
    "because leptons carry hypercharge , there are three additional diagrams one should include in figure [ fig : gludress ] if dressing instead by the bino , namely , those involving the scalar neutrino ; these diagrams are shown in figure [ fig : bdress ] , and the corresponding terms from the triplet operator are : @xmath159 applying the bino dressing to each of these terms gives us another sum of four - fermion effective operators involving hypercharge : @xmath160 this group of terms has a different product of hypercharges from that of ( [ eq : binodr - q ] ) , but it still has a single common product among the three terms , so we can again factor it out , leaving us with yet another vanishing contribution by the fierz argument .",
    "hence , the entire bino dressing contribution to the @xmath152 mode also vanishes under the universal mass assumption .      as the flavor - diagonal restrictions of the gluino and bino also apply to the @xmath126 but _ not _ to the @xmath161 , they must be considered separately .",
    "that said , one additional restriction applicable in both cases is the ability to interact with only left - handed particles ; thus there will be no contribution here from the @xmath162-type operators .    [",
    "[ neutral - wino . ] ] neutral wino .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    as noted , dressing with the @xmath126 is also restricted to @xmath142 contributions to the @xmath152 mode .",
    "the terms to be dressed are the same as those in the bino case , given by expressions ( [ eq : udsn - q ] ) and ( [ eq : udsn - nu ] ) ; however , in applying the dressing , we find a kink in the previous argument : @xmath163 the negative weak isospins carried by the down - type fields prevent us from using the fierz identity argument .",
    "thus it seems we have finally found a non - vanishing contribution to proton decay , albeit to only this one mode .",
    "there is something yet to be gained from the fierz identity in this case : the same zero sum we have seen in the previous cases tells us that in each expression here , the sum of the two negative terms is equal to the first term ; furthermore , note that the final expressions in ( [ eq : winodr - q ] ) and ( [ eq : winodr - nu ] ) are actually identical .",
    "therefore , we can collect the above contributions into one expression : @xmath164 including the factors from the triplet operator , we can write an operator for the entire neutral wino contribution to @xmath152 : @xmath165l}\\ , \\{(u^a s^c)(d^b \\nu_l ) + ( u^a d^b)(s^c    \\nu_l)\\ } ,    \\label{eq : wino0-tot}\\ ] ] where the sign cancels with that from the @xmath166 term in eq.([eq : effw ] ) .",
    "the details of @xmath147 will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "note i could have instead written the above expression in terms of @xmath167 alone ; i chose the two - operator version because the up - up- and down - down - type pairings in the latter option are forbidden in higgsino and charged wino modes and so are not seen in the calculation otherwise .",
    "[ [ charged - wino . ] ] charged wino .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    the assumption of universal mass means that the sfermions are simultaneously flavor and mass eigenstates ; therefore , the would - be unitary rotation matrix for each is simply the identity , @xmath168 . as a result , the unitary matrix present in the fermion - sfermion - wino couplings is not @xmath169 , but rather the single unitary matrix corresponding to the fermion quark rotation .",
    "nonetheless , this rotation allows for the mixing of generations at the dressing vertices , and the limitations found on the neutral current dressings are not applicable .",
    "this is quite crucial since it allows for contributions from diagrams with any squark propagator not forbidden by the anti - symmetry of the @xmath170 operator .",
    "proton decay modes involving neutral kaons or pions , which have @xmath171 or @xmath172 as external quarks , would be intractable without generation mixing .",
    "such mixing will of course come at the expense of suppression from an off - diagonal element in the pertinent unitary matrix , which will typically be @xmath173 ; hence , one can begin to see an indication of why the @xmath152 mode is so dominant in the full proton decay width .",
    "one additional constraint on charged wino dressing involves the wino mass insertion .",
    "unlike the gauginos discussed so far , @xmath174 are the antiparticles of _ each other _ , rather than either being its own antiparticle . as a result ,",
    "the wino mass term is of the form @xmath175 ; in order to involve one @xmath176 and one @xmath177 in the dressing , the two sfermions involved must be of opposite @xmath29 flavor . as a result ,",
    "triplet operators of the form @xmath178 , @xmath179 ( or the rh equivalents ) , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 do not contribute .    beyond these constraints ,",
    "the generational freedom of the sfermions leads to numerous contributions to each of the crucial decay modes , @xmath152 , @xmath182 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "in particular the @xmath141- and @xmath166-type operators each contribute to _ each _ mode through multiple channels .",
    "a list of all such contributions would likely be overwhelming to the reader no matter how excellent my choices of notation , but one can find the relevant diagrams in appendix [ fds ] .      when compared to the others , higgsino dressing is wildly unconstrained .",
    "first , the low - scale yukawa couplings governing the fermion - sfermion - higgsino interactions couple a left - handed field to a right - handed one , so clearly the dressing can be applied to both @xmath112- and @xmath114-type triplet operators . also , since charged and neutral higgsinos couple through the same yukawas , both types of interactions can mix generations , meaning the generation - diagonal constraints on the rest of the neutral - current dressings do not apply to @xmath183 . the only previously - mentioned restriction that _ does _ apply is , like the charged wino , the mass term for the susy higgs couples @xmath184 to @xmath185 , so it therefore can not contribute through the triplet operators with sfermions of like @xmath29 flavor .",
    "one remaining minor restriction is that we will not see the triplet operator @xmath186 dressed by @xmath187 nor @xmath188 dressed by @xmath189 because each would result in an outgoing left - handed anti - neutrino .",
    "one can find cases in the literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) of higgsino - dressed contributions being counted as negligible when compared to those from the wino ; this is usually because if one exchanges the @xmath190 found in a typical dominant wino contribution for a @xmath191 found in a typical dominant higgsino contribution , the resulting value will be smaller by at least a factor of @xmath192 .",
    "of course one makes several assumptions in such a comparison : @xmath193 for one , but additionally that @xmath15 @xmath13 is small or moderate , and @xmath16 the @xmath97 coefficients are usually of roughly the same magnitude for any combination of @xmath194 present .    for this analysis ,",
    "though , neither assumption is valid : i have already mentioned that i will consider large @xmath13 for maximal applicability ; furthermore , due to the rank-1 texture of the @xmath56 coupling and the related sparse or hierarchical textures of @xmath55 and @xmath57 as shown in eq.([eq : y ] ) , many of the @xmath97 are small or zero , creating large disparities between the values from one contribution to the next .",
    "this discrepancy from expectation is further enhanced by the tendency for the unitary matrices @xmath195 , which give the off - diagonal suppressions at the dressing vertices in this model , to individually deviate from the hierarchical structure of @xmath196 .    to see the extent to which these two properties can lead to surprises in numerical dominance ,",
    "consider that , for example , i find @xmath197 ; one might expect that @xmath198 and therefore the former term is much larger than the latter , but in fact neither assumption is accurate .    as a result of these model characteristics , i find that the dominant contributions from higgsino - dressed diagrams are generally comparable to those from wino - dressed diagrams .",
    "this statement further applies to contributions from _ right - handed _ operators as well .",
    "thus i made no _ a priori _ assumptions about which of the @xmath112- or @xmath114-type higgsino - dressed contributions might be excluded as negligible .    because both the @xmath199 operators and the @xmath183 dressing contribute to all of the pertinent decay modes , the complete list of channels dressed by the higgsino is considerably more plentiful than that of the wino and would again , i suspect , be of no more than marginal use to any but the most involved reader . again though one can find all of the pertinent diagrams in appendix [ fds ] .",
    "as i discussed above in the higgsino dressing subsection , the yukawa texture seen in eq.([eq : y ] ) leads to @xmath15 unusually extreme variation in the sizes of the @xmath97 coefficients , depending strongly on the index values present , and @xmath16 textures for the unitary matrices @xmath195 which deviate substantially from that of @xmath196 .",
    "the repercussions of these features clearly extend beyond affecting the relative size of wino and higgsino channel contributions .",
    "for one , the off - diagonal suppressions @xmath200 present in most charged wino diagrams can not be dependably approximated as @xmath201 ; fortunately , the gut - scale @xmath195 are fixed by the fermion fitting , and since the running of such unitary matrices is small , i can simply use them at the @xmath161 vertices as reasonable approximations to their low - scale counterparts .",
    "another complication due the yukawa texture is the disturbance of typically useful assumptions about which channels dominate the calculation .",
    "such assumptions include dominance of higgsino channels with @xmath202 intermediate states or wino channels @xmath203 or @xmath204 . in the absence of the validity of any such simplification ,",
    "i am compelled to presume that _ any _ channel might be a non - negligible contribution to decay width .",
    "thus , i initially treated all possible channels as potentially significant ; however , in the interest of saving considerable computational time , i chose an abridged set of contributions to include in my numerical analysis through inspection of tentative calculations , although my threshold for inclusion was quite conservative .",
    "it seemed to me that conventional methods of keeping only the most dominant terms for calculation might easily lead to drastically underestimated decay widths , in that if i exclude ten `` negligible '' terms smaller than leading contributions by a factor of ten , then i have evidently excluded the equivalent of a leading contribution .",
    "to fully avoid such folly , i used a cutoff of roughly 1/50 for exclusion , and made cuts on a per - triplet - operator basis , which translates to three or four significant figures of precision in the decay widths .",
    "the feynman diagrams for all non - vanishing channels of proton decay for the @xmath117 , @xmath182 , @xmath205 , and @xmath20 modes are catalogued in appendix [ fds ] .",
    "calculation of a proton partial decay width can be broken into three distinct parts .",
    "the first part is the evaluation of the `` internal '' , @xmath124 dressed diagrams discussed in the previous subsection ; each diagram corresponds to an effective operator of the form @xmath206 , where @xmath207   is a numerical coefficient unique to each decay channel .",
    "note that here each @xmath208 is a single quark fermion , not a doublet .",
    "the second part is the evaluation of a hadronic factor that quantifies the conversion of the three external quarks of a dressed diagram ",
    "plus one spectator quark  into a proton and a meson .",
    "the third and final part is the evaluation of the `` external '' effective diagram for @xmath209 giving the decay width of the proton .",
    "i will go through the details of each stage before giving the resulting decay width expressions .",
    "[ [ evaluating - the - dressed - operators . ] ] evaluating the dressed operators .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the evaluation of one such dressed @xmath124 box diagram involves calculating the loop integral but no kinematics , because the physical particles carrying real momenta here are the proton and the meson , not the quarks .",
    "the loop factor is not divergent and is of the same general form for every channel ; furthermore , as the heavy triplets are common to all diagrams and the sfermion masses are assumed to be equal , the only factors in the loop that vary from one channel to the next are the couplings and masses associated with either the wino or higgsino . the remaining variation from one diagram to the next depends entirely on the particle flavors , which is apparent in the external fermions and encoded in the @xmath97 coefficients and the unitary matrices involved in rotation to mass basis .",
    "thus , i can write the operator for any pertinent diagram as a generic wino- or higgsino coefficient times one of several flavor - specific sub - operators ; the forms of the general operators are    @xmath210    and @xmath211 where differs from what is usually given in the literature for analogous proton decay expressions ; the discrepancy is due to my inclusion of the universal mass assumption prior to evaluating the loop integral . ] @xmath212 and the sub - operators @xmath213 are ) , we can see that @xmath214 . ]",

    "furthermore , it is known that unitary matrices such as the ckm matrix experience only very slight effects due to susy renormalization .",
    "thus , since the low - scale masses are of course known , i can define good approximations to the susy yukawas needed by using the high - scale @xmath195 to rotate the diagonal mass couplings at the proton scale , divided by the appropriate vevs : @xmath228 where @xmath229 , or , in component notation , @xmath230 i can similarly write @xmath231 where @xmath232 .",

    "these differences may seem rather benign , but in fact each of these slightly suppressed values individually translates into a factor of 10 suppression in most of the dominant @xmath331s , which all tend to involve third generation elements . in some cases two or even three",
    "such suppressions may affect a single @xmath332 factor .",

    ", i was able to obtain successful fits for all fermion sector parameters , including the @xmath2 reactor mixing angle , and for both seesaw types .",
    "using the yukawa couplings fixed by those fermion sector fits as input , i then searched the parameter space of the heavy triplet higgs sector mixing for areas yielding adequate partial lifetimes , again using numerical minimization to optimize results .",
    "for the case with type - ii seesaw , i found that lifetime limits for five of the six decay modes of interest are satisfied for nearly arbitrary values of the triplet mixing parameters , with an especially mild @xmath4 cancellation required in order to satisfy the limit for the @xmath337 mode .",
    "additionally , i deduced that partial lifetime values of @xmath338years are vanishingly unlikely in the model , implying the value can be taken as a _ de facto _ lifetime for the mode , which makes the model ultimately testable .",
    "for the case with type - i seesaw , i found that limits for _ all six _ decay modes of interest are satisfied for values of the triplet mixing parameters that do not result in substantial enhancement , with limits for modes other than @xmath3 satisfied for nearly arbitrary parameter values ; furthermore , i deduced a statistical maximum lifetime for @xmath3 of just under @xmath6years . given these results , i conclude that the well - motivated yukawa texture ansatz proposed by dutta , mimura , and mohapatra is a phenomenological success , capable of suppressing proton decay without the usual need for cancellation and without compromising any aspect of the corresponding fermion mass spectrum .",
