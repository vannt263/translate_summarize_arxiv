    "weak lensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the dark matter distribution in our universe and constraining dark energy parameters @xcite . gravitational fields due to the large scale matter distribution perturb light rays traveling from distant galaxies , causing the observed galaxy shapes to be slightly distorted compared to their true shapes .",

    "@xmath10 , however , can not be straightforwardly calculated , since it contains not only the designed survey depth ( the number of galaxies we see given the design of the survey ) , but also the performance of the entire analysis pipeline one uses to measure these distortions ( the amount of the information we can actually extract from each galaxy given the measurement methods ) .    in a06",
    ", the question of calculating @xmath10 is rephrased in terms of calculating @xmath0 , the effective number density of galaxies used for weak lensing measurements .",
    "a06 defined @xmath0 to be _ the number density of perfectly measured galaxies that would contribute the same amount of shear noise as the ( imperfectly ) measured ensemble of galaxies_. the standard deviation in each component of the ellipticity for the perfectly measured galaxy population ( commonly known as `` shape noise '' ) , @xmath11 , is assumed to be fixed at 0.25 in a06 .",
    "the term `` noise '' refers to the fact that the intrinsic galaxy shapes introduce uncertainty in the shear inferred from these galaxies .",
    "most studies to date have adopted the formulae and model parameters in a06 to estimate the performance of future weak lensing surveys .",
    "however , the ways in which @xmath0 is quoted in the literature are often inconsistent , causing confusion in the field . the main goal of this paper is to clearly define @xmath0 , estimate @xmath0 for lsst , and quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of @xmath0 to different assumptions about the survey plan and analysis pipeline .",
    "our methodology for calculating @xmath0 is general and can be applied to other surveys given the basic survey and analysis information .    in , we first review briefly the weak lensing notation and definition of @xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss the relevant information about the dataset and the analysis pipeline required to calculate @xmath0 .",

    "is included in the integrands in to reduce the fluctuations in ellipticity measurements .",
    "the width of @xmath27 is approximately the size of the observed object  this yields the maximum signal - to - noise ratio for each individual object . due to imperfect point - spread - function ( psf ) models and this weighting function @xmath27 ,",
    "is no longer exact . as a result , the `` shear responsivity '' @xcite is introduced to correct for this effect . in practice , due to the existence of noise - induced biases @xcite",
    ", the shear measurements need to be further calibrated from simulations @xcite .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the relevant quantity in measuring the statistical power of a survey is the uncertainty on the mean shear per unit area , or @xmath10 ( given fixed @xmath9 ) . for each galaxy , since the shear noise results from the intrinsic shape noise as well as measurement noise , we can write ,    @xmath28    where we have assumed that shape noise is uncorrelated with measurement noise .",

    "note that measurement noise depends on the galaxy s shape , size and brightness , while shape noise is usually taken to be constant for the entire galaxy sample ( however , see discussion in ) .",

    "first , we need an understanding of the intrinsic distribution of galaxies in the multi - dimensional space ( , size , magnitude , redshift , shape , ) , given the depth of the lsst dataset .",
    "second , we need to understand the expected shear measurement error for each galaxy , which depends on the characteristics of the galaxy , the measurement algorithm , how multiple measurements of the same galaxy are combined , and considerations of systematic errors in the measurement .",
    "we address the first part of the problem ( the intrinsic galaxy distribution ) in and the second part ( the shear measurement error ) in .",
    "it is important to realize that even for the same dataset , it is possible to get different @xmath0 values depending on the different choices one makes with the analysis pipeline .",
    "thus one needs to be careful when quoting or comparing these numbers , to give enough information on the assumptions involved .",
    "we also note that in we have intentionally separated the systematic errors from the statistical errors in the @xmath0 calculation for simplicity .",
    "however , as we discuss in , @xmath0 depends on several factors in the analysis pipeline that are set by requirements on systematic errors in shear measurements . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 can be coupled with the systematic errors in an indirect way . the exact tradeoff between systematic and statistical errors for cosmic shear measurements , and the effect on @xmath0 is algorithm - dependent and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "to start , we need a realistic galaxy catalog that contains the primary characteristics ( redshift , size , magnitude and shape ) of the galaxies expected to be seen in a 10-year lsst weak lensing dataset . the lsst weak lensing survey is expected to image 18,000 square degrees @xcite of the sky in six filter bands ( @xmath49 ) to a median redshift of @xmath501.2 and depth of @xmath51 and @xmath52-band ab magnitude at 5@xmath30 for a point source . ]",
    "@xcite . for this study",
    ", we use a typical simulated galaxy catalogue generated by the lsst catalog simulator @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe here the key steps and references for creating the galaxy catalog to help readers understand the results of this work .",

    "each galaxy in the @xcite catalog is characterized by a list of parameters for the bulge and the disk component of the galaxy separately .",
    "a sophisticated fitting program then finds the best fit spectral energy distribution ( sed ) parameters and galaxy extinction that reproduce the color information for each galaxy . generates galaxy catalogs with realistic galaxy morphologies , apparent colors and spatial distributions , and redshifts extending up to 5 on an area of @xmath53 square degrees .",
    "the simulations include galaxies with @xmath1-band ab magnitudes brighter than 28 . in @xcite , the galaxy number density as a function of magnitude and redshift in the catalog is shown to be well matched to observations in the deep2 redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and size of each galaxy will be used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio ( ) and effective size ( ) of each measurement ( see ) .",
    "these two quantities determine the measurement noise , @xmath54 , for each galaxy ( see ) .",
    "finally , we assign shapes , or apparent ellipticities to each galaxy according to those measured in the cosmos dataset ( * ? ? ?",
    "* private communication ) .",
    "these galaxy shapes have been corrected for measurement noise by excluding small and faint galaxies @xcite . in",
    ", we show the redshift , apparent @xmath1- and @xmath2-band ( the two main lensing bands ) ab magnitude , size and ellipticity ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) distributions of the galaxy population used in this study .",

    "finally , we note that the distribution of the absolute ellipticity ( @xmath58 ) , as shown in ( f ) , agrees well with that derived in @xcite , which is based on the sdss dataset .",
    "although we assume shape noise to be independent of galaxy morphology , redshift , size and magnitude in our calculations , this is not strictly true .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed that the ratio of early - type ( elliptical ) to late - type ( spiral and irregular ) galaxies at low redshift is higher compared to that at high redshift .",
    "this could in principle introduce a redshift - dependent shape noise .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the estimated shape noise as a function of galaxy redshift , size and magnitude is consistent with being flat within measurement noise in the cosmos data . as a result",
    ", we choose to make the first - order approximation in this work that shape noise is constant as measured in @xcite .",
    "a non - constant @xmath11 correction to this approximation will require further investigation with deep space - based data ( , * ? ? ? * ) and better shear measurement algorithms .",
    "in this section we estimate the shear measurement noise , @xmath54 , for a large range of galaxies under realistic observing conditions using high - fidelity simulations .",
    "we then select the galaxies used for weak lensing measurements .",
    "we invoke the lsst photon simulator v3.2 @xcite to generate high - fidelity images with realistic noise and instrumental / atmospheric effects .",

    "it adopts an atmospheric model with 7 kolmogorov turbulent screens distributed from a few meters to a few tens of kilometers above the telescope .",
    "each screen is described by several parameters associated with the wind speed / direction and turbulence strength .",
    "the optics model in is based on the most up - to - date engineering design , with optical errors ( , optics element mis - alignment , mirror surface perturbation , tracking errors , ) at the level set by engineering specifications .",

    "is usually achieved in the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band images . for optimal results in weak lensing measurements ,",
    "the algorithm would thus preferentially choose to image in one of these `` lensing bands '' when the observing conditions are good .    with the input galaxy catalog from and the observing parameters from , we use to generate a set of 1,000 simulated 15-s @xmath1-band lsst exposures in single 15-s exposures from the simulations and",
    "assign identical observing parameters for the two exposure in the same visit . ] on a single lsst ccd sensor .",
    "for the 1,000 exposures , we simulate galaxies with the redshift , size , magnitude and shape distributions in , and randomly assign observing conditions based on the distributions in .",
    "we select 10 random locations on the lsst focal plane for these simulations to capture realistic psf effects across the field of view . for each exposure , we make two images : the first image contains galaxies from , while the second image is identical to the first , except that we replace each of the galaxies with a bright star that effectively samples the psf of its galaxy counterpart in the first image .    for each simulated image , we detect objects using the source extractor software and measure shear using the software package .",
    "the shear measurement algorithm performs the following steps : first , the shapes of both stars and galaxies are measured .",
    "then , for each galaxy in the first image , the psf effects are corrected using the corresponding bright star in the second image .",
    "finally , a shear value is calculated for each galaxy .",
    "the difference between the measured shear and the input shear is the shear measurement error , or    @xmath59    we use for the shape / shear measurement because it is one of the most commonly used methods for weak lensing studies",
    ". the results from this paper will thus be directly relevant to the ongoing and future surveys .",
    "but given recent improvements in the shear measurement methods @xcite , our results are conservative in this regard .",
    "note that in this analysis framework we have ignored several effects from a realistic stellar population .",
    "first , we choose to estimate @xmath0 for a typical weak lensing field , with galactic latitude of @xmath60 degrees .",
    "the stellar density in these fields is relatively low ( @xmath61 arcmin@xmath5 ) , such that significant blending from stars can be ignored .",
    "second , by simulating the `` true '' psf for each galaxy via simulations ( in the second image ) , we have avoided the process of psf modeling .",
    "this includes selecting well - measured stars and modeling the psf by interpolating shape parameters of these stars .",
    "the effect of imperfect star selection is expected to be small , since the bright stars used for psf modeling are generally easy to identify without much contamination from the galaxies .",
    "the effect of interpolating shape parameters from stars depends on the interpolation scheme . in ,",
    "we show that using a conventional interpolation method for psf modeling yields only a small ( 36% ) degradation in @xmath0 compared to the case for which the psf is known exactly .",
    "our approach of estimating shear measurement noise from is very similar to that used in @xcite .",
    "the major differences between the simulations described here and that in @xcite are ( 1 ) we simulate single - exposure depths instead of the expected full survey depth , and ( 2 ) we do not include shape noise in our definition of measurement errors .      to characterize the shear measurement noise @xmath54",

    ", we show how @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be calculated from observational quantities as well as the generic galaxy model described in and observational parameters .",
    "the main task of this section is to determine the coefficients in from the shear measurements in . to do this",

    "we use 30 logarithmic bins in @xmath62 ranging from 3 to 650 and 30 logarithmic bins in @xmath63 ranging from 0.2 to 43 , which covers all the galaxies measured in these simulations .",
    "since each bin contains a different number of galaxies , an uncertainty estimate of @xmath76 is used for each bin during the fit , where @xmath77 is the number of galaxies in that bin .",

    "four parameters from the catalog ( the apparent magnitude , the galaxy bulge and disk half - light radii , and the bulge - to - total flux ratio ) and two parameters from the catalog ( the seeing and sky background in each exposure ) are used .",

    ", our estimation of @xmath54 would be an extrapolation .",
    "shear measurements from the same galaxy imaged in multiple exposures are combined to give a single estimate of shear per galaxy . for lsst",
    ", this is a crucial step because the number of exposures of each galaxy is typically an order of magnitude larger than for previous surveys .",
    "that is , the algorithm one uses to combine these shear measurements is important .",
    "different approaches have been suggested to deal with such multi - epoch datasets .",
    "conventionally , one would create co - added images and carry out the full analysis on the co - add .",
    "this is not an optimal approach , for one throws away information obtained in the sharpest images and furthermore , correlates the noise in the pixels and creates biases in the shear estimates .",
    "@xcite and more recently @xcite and @xcite have suggested taking the approach of joint fitting , where the individual exposures are kept separate throughout the analysis .",
    "the detections would still be made on a coadded image to maximize signal - to - noise ratio in the detection process .",

    "the difference can be due to the specific psf modeling technique one uses .",
    "this means that the fit shown in ( based on single exposure measurements ) may no longer be appropriate in the case of coadded images .",
    "nevertheless , for the purpose of this analysis , we avoided most psf - related issues and specifically explored a wide range of reasonable @xmath93 values . as a result",
    ", we will make the approximation @xmath94 , effectively generalizing to all @xmath93 values .",
    "we first consider the case for which only @xmath1-band images are used and then consider the case for which both @xmath1- and @xmath2-band images are used .",
    "for lsst , we expect a similar number ( @xmath95 368 ) of @xmath1- and @xmath2-band 15-s exposures in the full 10-year dataset .",
    "note that the technical difficulties of combining images for different bands still need to be assessed ( see also discussion in ) .      in all weak lensing analyses to date , one does not use all the galaxies that are detected and identified as galaxies to conduct cosmic shear measurements . instead",
    ", only galaxies that pass certain criteria make it into the final summation in .",
    "although noisy galaxies naturally have low weights in , there are several practical reasons that one rejects part of the galaxy population : first , most shear measurement algorithms become numerically unstable when working with noisy galaxies .",
    "second , these noisy galaxies are subject to noise bias @xcite and can increase the systematic errors significantly .",
    "finally , assuming one were to calibrate these systematic errors with simulations @xcite , the calibration process becomes challenging and unstable as the measurement noise increases .",
    "given the reasoning above , a natural route to select galaxies is to base the selection on the relative level of the shear measurement errors ( @xmath54 ) and the shape noise ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in other words , we use only galaxies that satisfy :    @xmath96    where @xmath82 is of order unity and depends on the performance of the shear measurement algorithm . in the main analysis of this paper , we choose three @xmath82 values based on studies in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that most current shear measurement algorithms perform well on objects with ( @xmath97)@xmath95 ( 40 , 1.5 ) , operate with moderate accuracy on objects with ( @xmath81 ) @xmath95 ( 20 , 1 ) , and tend to fail on objects with ( @xmath97 ) @xmath95 ( 10 , 0.5 ) .",
    "these three cases roughly correspond to @xmath98(2.0 , 1.0 , 0.5 ) if we assume the shear measurement noise follows . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will thus consider these three galaxy selection cuts , where @xmath99 corresponds to the fiducial case , @xmath100 corresponds to the optimistic case , and @xmath101 corresponds to the conservative case .",
    "the fiducial case corresponds to using a shear measurement algorithm with accuracy similar to current state - of - the - art methods .",
    "we note that a more common approach in existing weak lensing analysis pipelines is to select galaxies based on a 2d cut in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plane .",
    "however , we argue that galaxy selection based on such a cut is not necessarily optimal . as illustrated in , the two galaxy samples selected by the @xmath85 contour and the dashed rectangle ( equivalent to a 2d cut of @xmath102 ) have the same allowed maximum measurement noise .",
    "but the dashed line clearly removes less parameter space than the @xmath85 contour , thus leading to smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this simple illustration demonstrates that if the measurement noise can be properly estimated , the most efficient way to select galaxies for weak lensing measurements is to base the selection on the measurement noise directly ( ) .    finally , we consider the range of redshifts for galaxies used in the analysis .",
    "it is common for lensing analyses to only consider a limited redshift range since objects at very high redshift will have photometric redshifts that are poorly estimated , while objects at very low redshift do not provide much cosmological information .",
    "we assume that the lsst photometric redshifts uncertainties are consistent with those given in @xcite and consider only galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 3 .",

    "<S> we find that with current weak lensing algorithms , expected distributions of observing parameters , and all lensing data ( @xmath1- and @xmath2-band , covering 18,000 degree@xmath3 of sky ) for lsst , @xmath4 arcmin@xmath5 before considering blending and masking , @xmath6 arcmin@xmath5 when rejecting seriously blended galaxies and @xmath7 arcmin@xmath5 when considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking . with future improvements in weak lensing algorithms , these values could be expected to increase by up to 20% . throughout the paper </S>",
    "<S> , we also stress the ways in which @xmath0 depends on our ability to understand and control systematic effects in the measurements .    </S>",
