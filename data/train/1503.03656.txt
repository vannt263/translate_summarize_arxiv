    "hard exclusive processes involving energetic pions in the final state are sensitive to the momentum fraction distribution of the valence quarks at small transverse separations , usually called the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "classical applications  @xcite have been to exclusive two - photon processes , e.g. , the pion electromagnetic form factor at large momentum transfer and the transition form factor @xmath6 .",
    "the latter process plays a very special rle as the simplest hard exclusive reaction where qcd factorization can be tested at a quantitative level .",
    "it received a lot of interest recently , triggered by the partially conflicting measurements by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite up to photon virtualities of the order of @xmath7 , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "arguably , the most important application of the pion da is currently the study of semileptonic weak decays @xmath8 at large recoil  @xcite using light - cone sum rules ( lcsr )  @xcite and weak hadronic decays @xmath9 etc .  in the framework of qcd factorization  @xcite .",
    "both reactions contribute prominently to the determination of parameters of the quark mixing matrix in the standard model .",
    "the precise definition of the pion da @xmath10 is based on the representation  @xcite as the matrix element of a nonlocal light - ray quark - antiquark operator .",
    "for example , for a positively charged pion @xmath11 u(z_1n ) |\\pi(p)\\rangle } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & if_\\pi ( p\\cdot n )    \\int_0 ^ 1 dx\\ , e^{-i(z_1 x + z_2 ( 1-x ) ) p\\cdot n}\\phi_{\\pi}(x,\\mu^2)\\ , ,   \\label{def : phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the pion momentum , @xmath13 is a light - like vector , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are real numbers , @xmath16 $ ] is the wilson line connecting the quark and the antiquark fields and @xmath17 is the usual pion decay constant .",
    "the da @xmath18 is scale - dependent , which is indicated by the argument @xmath19 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the variable @xmath20 is that the @xmath21-quark carries the fraction @xmath20 of the pion momentum , so that @xmath22 is the momentum fraction carried by the @xmath23-antiquark .",
    "neglecting isospin breaking effects and electromagnetic corrections the pion da is symmetric under the interchange @xmath24 : @xmath25 due to this symmetry , only the even moments involving the momentum fraction _ difference _ @xmath26 carry nontrivial physical information : @xmath27 the definition in ( [ def : phi ] ) implies the normalization condition @xmath28    a convenient parameterization of das is provided by the conformal expansion  @xcite . the underlying idea is to use the conformal symmetry of the qcd lagrangian to separate transverse and longitudinal variables in the light - front pion wave function , similar in spirit to the partial - wave decomposition in quantum mechanics .",
    "the dependence on transverse coordinates is formulated as a scale dependence of the relevant operators and is governed by renormalization - group equations .",
    "the dependence on the longitudinal momentum fractions is described in terms of gegenbauer polynomials @xmath29 which correspond to irreducible representations of the collinear conformal group sl(2,@xmath30 ) . in this way one obtains @xmath31 , \\label{eq : gegen1}\\ ] ] where all nonperturbative information is contained in the set of coefficients ( gegenbauer moments ) @xmath32 at a certain reference scale @xmath33 . to leading - logarithmic accuracy ( lo )",
    ", the gegenbauer moments renormalize multiplicatively with the anomalous dimensions rising slowly with @xmath34 .",
    "thus the higher - order contributions in the gegenbauer expansion are suppressed at large scales and asymptotically only the leading term survives , @xmath35 which is usually referred to as the asymptotic pion da .",
    "it is widely accepted , however , that the pion da deviates significantly from its asymptotic form at scales that can be achieved in experiments .    a particular model of the pion da proposed by chernyak and zhitnitsky in 1982",
    "@xcite has played an important rle in historic perspective .",
    "it was based on a calculation of @xmath36 using qcd sum rules  @xcite , which resulted in a large value @xmath37 ( at the scale 1 gev ) , and the assumption that all higher - order coefficients can be neglected .    since then , different approaches have been used : qcd sum rules with various improvements ( e.g.  @xcite ) , lcsr - based analysis of experimental data on the pion electromagnetic and transition form factors ( e.g.  @xcite ) and weak @xmath38-meson decay form factors ( e.g.  @xcite ) , lattice calculations  @xcite and recently also in the framework of dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite . a recent compilation of the existing results for @xmath36 can be found in table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "estimates of yet higher - order gegenbauer coefficients are rather uncertain .",
    "a direct calculation of @xmath39 proves to be difficult and its extraction from the experimental data on , e.g. , the pion transition form factor is complicated by the fact the lo contribution is proportional to the sum of gegenbauer moments @xmath40\\,.\\ ] ] thus , the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 obtained in these extractions appear to be strongly correlated .",
    "the strong scaling violation in the pion transition form factor observed by babar  @xcite ( but not confirmed by belle  @xcite ) would imply a considerable enhancement of the pion da close to the end - points , meaning that the expansion in gegenbauer polynomials is converging very slowly if at all , see the detailed discussion in  @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming upgrade of the belle experiment and the kekb accelerator  @xcite , which aims to increase the experimental data set by a factor of 50 , will allow one to measure transition form factors and related observables with unprecedented precision and resolve this issue .",
    "the question at stake is whether hard exclusive hadronic reactions are under theoretical control , which is highly relevant for all future high - intensity , medium energy experiments like , e.g. , panda . on the theory side , several proposals exist how it might be possible to access da moments beyond the second one ( or the da pointwise in @xmath20 ) on the lattice , e.g. ,  @xcite , but the corresponding techniques are only in the exploratory stage .    in this work",
    "we extend the lattice study  @xcite of the second moment of the pion da by making use of a larger set of lattices with different volumes , lattice spacings and pion masses down to @xmath0 and implementing several technical improvements .",
    "we employ the variational approach with two and three interpolators to improve the signal from the pion state .",
    "the renormalization of the lattice data is performed nonperturbatively utilizing a version of the ri-smom scheme . for the first time",
    "we include a nonperturbative calculation of the renormalization factor corresponding to the mixing with total derivatives , which proves to have a significant effect .",
    "our main result is @xmath43 for the second gegenbauer moment of the pion da , and @xmath44 both numbers refer to the scale @xmath45 in the @xmath5 scheme .",
    "the first error combines the statistical uncertainty and the uncertainty of the chiral extrapolation .",
    "the second error is the estimated uncertainty contributed by the nonperturbative determination of the renormalization and mixing factors .",
    "our lattice data are collected for the lattice spacing @xmath46 , and this range is not large enough to ensure a reliable continuum extrapolation .",
    "the corresponding remaining uncertainty is indicated as ( ? ) .",
    "it has to be addressed in a future study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the aspects of the continuum description of the pion da that are relevant for our work .",
    "the basics of the lattice formulation are given in sec .",
    "[ sect : latform ] .",
    "an important ingredient in our calculation is the nonperturbative evaluation of the renormalization and mixing coefficients , which is described in sec .",
    "[ sect : renco ] .",
    "the methods applied in the analysis of the bare data are detailed in sec .",
    "[ sect : anadata ] .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] , followed by our conclusions and an outlook . in an appendix we collect tables of intermediate results for each gauge field ensemble used in our work .",
    "the nonlocal operator in the expression for the pion da ( [ def : phi ] ) is defined as a generating function for renormalized leading - twist ( i.e. , twist two ) local operators , @xmath47 u(z_1n ) = } \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   \\sum_{k , l=0}^\\infty \\frac{z_2^k z_1^l}{k!l ! }   n^\\rho n^{\\mu_1}\\ldots n^{\\mu_{k+l } }   \\mathcal{m}_{\\rho\\mu_1\\ldots\\mu_{k+l}}^{(k , l ) } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the covariant derivative and @xmath50 denotes the symmetrization of all enclosed lorentz indices and the subtraction of traces .",
    "the local operators @xmath51 are assumed to be renormalized , e.g. , in the @xmath5  scheme .    as a consequence ,",
    "moments of the pion da are given by matrix elements of local operators : @xmath52 neglecting isospin breaking effects and electromagnetic corrections one obtains the symmetry relation @xmath53 and thus @xmath54 in addition , the product ( leibniz ) rule for derivatives @xmath55 gives rise to the momentum - conservation constraint @xmath56 specializing to the second moment , @xmath57 , it is easy to see that only one independent matrix element remains , e.g. , @xmath58 or @xmath59   \\notag\\\\ & = \\frac{7}{3}\\big[1 - 5 \\langle x(1-x)\\rangle \\big]\\ , , \\label{relations1b } \\ ] ] so that any moment @xmath60 , @xmath36 , @xmath61 etc .  can be used as a nonperturbative parameter to characterize the shape of the pion da .",
    "lacking any _ a priori _  information on the relative size of the different contributions , all such choices are equivalent .",
    "it is widely expected , however , that the numerical value of @xmath60 is not far from 1/5 corresponding to the asymptotic pion da ( [ asymptotic ] ) . hence , if @xmath62 is determined with a given accuracy at some reference scale @xmath33 by a certain nonperturbative method , and @xmath36 is then obtained from the relation ( [ relations2 ] ) , the error on @xmath36 is strongly amplified by the subtraction of the asymptotic contribution .",
    "this effect is well known and has been observed in all calculations up to date .",
    "the error on @xmath36 is relevant as it propagates through the renormalization group equations . in other words , although using @xmath36 as a nonperturbative parameter instead of @xmath60 for the pion da at a low reference scale @xmath63 is just a rewriting , this choice is much more adequate in order to describe the pion da at high scales , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which enters qcd factorization theorems .",
    "another issue to consider is that the relation in eq .",
    "( [ leibniz ] ) and therefore ( [ relations1a ] ) , ( [ relations1b ] ) , ( [ relations2 ] ) can be broken by lattice artifacts .",
    "thus the choice of suitable operators requires some care .",
    "we will discuss our choice in more detail in the next section .",
    "while the above relations refer to renormalized operators in minkowski space , we now move to euclidean space and define the bare operators @xmath66 \\gamma_{\\rho ) }   \\gamma_5 \\ , u(x ) \\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\ { \\mathcal { o}}^+_{\\rho \\mu \\nu } ( x )     & = \\bar{d}(x ) \\left [ { \\overset{\\leftarrow}{d}_{(\\mu } } { \\overset{\\leftarrow}{d}_{\\nu } }     + 2 { \\overset{\\leftarrow}{d}_{(\\mu } } { \\overset{\\rightarrow}{d}_{\\nu } }     + { \\overset{\\rightarrow}{d}_{(\\mu } } { \\overset{\\rightarrow}{d}_{\\nu } } \\right ] \\gamma_{\\rho ) } \\gamma_5 \\ , u(x )   \\label{eq : opmultiplets}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as our operator basis . on the lattice",
    "the covariant derivatives will be replaced by their discretized versions .",
    "the operator @xmath67 can be written in a conventional shorthand notation as @xmath68 and its matrix element between the vacuum and the pion state is proportional to the bare lattice value of @xmath69 . in the continuum ,",
    "the operator @xmath70 is the second derivative of the axial - vector current : @xmath71 however , this relation is violated on the lattice because of discretization errors in the derivatives .",
    "the distinction between @xmath70 and @xmath72 for finite lattice spacing appears to be numerically important and will be discussed in detail in what follows .",
    "note that @xmath73 is the euclidean analogue of the minkowski - space operator @xmath74 such that its matrix element between the vacuum and the pion state corresponds to the bare value of @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding renormalized ( e.g. , in the @xmath5 scheme ) axial - vector current is then given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 on the lattice .    in order to express its matrix elements in terms of the physical quantities introduced in minkowski space",
    "we apply the rules @xmath78 for @xmath79 , where the subscript m distinguishes the minkowski objects . consequently ,",
    "@xmath80 the components of the three - vector @xmath81 of the spatial momentum of the pion will be denoted by @xmath82 , although they are equal to the contravariant space components of the minkowski momentum @xmath83 .",
    "the time component of the minkowski momentum is identified with the corresponding energy : @xmath84 . in this way one gets in euclidean notation @xmath85    similarly ,",
    "the euclidean space components of the coordinate vector @xmath20 are identified with the contravariant components of the minkowski space - time four - vector , while for the time components we have @xmath86 .",
    "this entails the following rule for the covariant derivatives : @xmath87 therefore we find , e.g. , for @xmath88 @xmath89    the operators @xmath67 and @xmath70 mix under renormalization even in the continuum . on the lattice",
    "the continuous rotational @xmath90 symmetry of euclidean space is broken and reduced to the discrete @xmath91 symmetry of the hypercubic lattice .",
    "this symmetry breaking can introduce additional mixing operators .",
    "it can even lead to mixing of the operators of interest with operators of lower dimension such that the mixing coefficients are proportional to powers of @xmath92 .",
    "this complicates the renormalization procedure significantly .",
    "however , it may be possible to choose the lattice operators such that they belong to an irreducible representation of @xmath91 which forbids mixing with further operators , in particular with lower - dimensional operators . in the present case",
    "there is one such choice , given by the operators @xmath93 with all three indices different .",
    "for the computation of the required matrix elements we can restrict ourselves to the operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath94 the renormalized operators are then given by @xmath95 note that due to the discretization artifacts in the derivatives one can not expect @xmath96 to be equal to @xmath97 .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath98 and @xmath99 we are now left with two tasks : computation of the bare matrix elements and evaluation of the renormalization factors .",
    "we extract the bare matrix elements from two - point correlation functions of the operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 with suitable interpolating fields @xmath102 for the @xmath103-mesons .",
    "for the latter we consider the two possibilities @xmath104 with smeared quark fields .",
    "the details of our smearing algorithm will be given below .",
    "let @xmath105 where @xmath106 or @xmath107 , @xmath81 is the three - vector of the spatial momentum , and the summation goes over the set of spatial lattice points @xmath108 for a given euclidean time @xmath109 .    for times",
    "@xmath109 , where the correlation functions are saturated by the contribution of the lowest - mass pion state , we expect that , e.g. ,    @xmath110 \\,.\\ ] ]    here @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the temporal extent of our lattice , and the @xmath113-factors take into account transformation properties of the correlation functions under time reversal .",
    "one finds @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 for the operators @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "we utilize these symmetries in order to reduce the statistical fluctuations of our raw data , i.e. , we average over the two corresponding times @xmath109 and @xmath122 with the appropriate sign factors .    from the ratios @xmath123 we can extract the required bare matrix elements @xmath124 , which carry the information on the second moment of the pion da .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : xi2me ] ) shows that a calculation of matrix elements of @xmath117 requires two nonvanishing spatial components of the momentum .",
    "we choose them as small as possible , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the spatial extent of our lattice .",
    "to suppress statistical fluctuations we average over the possible directions , e.g. , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 for @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "if the correlation functions are dominated by the single - pion states , the time - dependent factors in the ratios of correlation functions cancel and we obtain , e.g. , for the operator @xmath133 and the momentum @xmath127 @xmath134 where the constants @xmath135 are related to the bare lattice values of the second moment of the pion da through @xmath136 they should not depend on the choice of the interpolating field @xmath137 . note that @xmath138 and therefore for bare quantities @xmath139 for the renormalized moments in the @xmath5 scheme we obtain @xmath140 \\,,\\label{eq : ren_moments}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 are ratios of renormalization constants defined in the next section .",
    "in the continuum limit we expect that @xmath142 hence the quantity @xmath143 should approach unity as the lattice spacing tends to zero . in this case the relation @xmath144 is recovered ( cf .",
    "( [ relations1b ] ) ) , whereas for finite lattice spacing it follows from ( [ eq : ren_moments ] ) @xmath145 we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ a2-from - xi2 ] ) is only recovered in the continuum limit , which is always delicate .",
    "there are two possibilities : either @xmath60 is measured on the lattice , the result extrapolated to zero lattice spacing , and at the final step @xmath36 is obtained using the relation ( [ a2-from - xi2 ] ) , or @xmath36 is calculated directly on the lattice and then extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
