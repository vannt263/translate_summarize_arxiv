    "over the past couple of decades , both observational and analytical work have suggested a physical connection between the formation and growth of galaxies and the growth of their central black holes .",
    "for example , the comoving emissivity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and the cosmic star formation rate have both similarly declined since @xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which might imply a link between star formation and agn activity .",
    "in addition , luminous agns are more often found in massive early - type galaxies with young stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . further support of a black hole ",
    "galaxy connection comes in the form of a number of correlations between properties of the host galaxies and the masses of their central black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "a key relationship is between black hole mass ( @xmath5 ) and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) , observed in both quiescent ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and active galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this relation was first predicted by @xcite and @xcite and has been explained by various analytic models",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as recovered in numerical simulations of evolving and interacting galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1  relationship can be used to infer @xmath0  in large samples of galaxies .",
    "this allows for the exploration of the bh mass function on much larger scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) and thus helps investigate the role of bhs in galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "direct @xmath0  measurements are made with stellar kinematics and gas dynamics , although these methods require good spatial resolution and are presently only feasible for nearby galaxies .",
    "agns , however , offer the most robust tracer of the evolution of the bh population over much of the history of the universe . under the assumption that the motion of the gas in the broad line region ( blr ) of agns is dominated by the gravitational influence of the black hole",
    ", one can use the virial relation @xmath7 to obtain @xmath5 , where @xmath8  is the average radius of the emitting gas in the blr , usually either determined with reverberation mapping ( e.g. , @xcite ) or estimated with the radius - luminosity relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath9 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , deduced from the width of the emission line , and @xmath10 is a dimensionless factor that accounts for the unknown geometry and orientation of the blr and may be different for each agn .    with current technology , we are unable to directly observe the structure of the blr , as it is unresolvable even with the largest telescopes , so the true value of @xmath10 for each object is unknown .",
    "this has contributed significantly to the uncertainties in @xmath0  measurements using blr emission lines .",
    "recent reverberation mapping ( rm ) efforts have begun to reveal more information about the actual structure of the blr and the value of @xmath10 in some objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , limited data for most agns requires the use of an average virial factor @xmath2 to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "currently , @xmath2 is calculated with the assumption that agns follow the same @xmath0@xmath1  relation as quiescent galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most estimates of @xmath11 are somewhat larger than @xmath12 ; @xcite find @xmath2 = 5.5 @xmath3 1.8 , @xcite find @xmath11 = 5.2 @xmath3 1.2 , and more recently , analysis by @xcite and @xcite both yield @xmath2 = 5.1 .",
    "@xcite obtain a slightly lower value , @xmath2 = 3.8@xmath13 .",
    "the difference between slopes and virial factors among studies using similar regression methods ( whether @xmath0  is considered the independent or dependent variable ) arise when different galaxy samples are used to determine these two quantities , which may suggest a morphological dependence or selection bias in the relation .",
    "in fact , recent studies do report a morphological dependence in the quiescent @xmath0@xmath1  relation , such that there are systematic differences in the relation for early - type ( higher - mass ) and late - type ( lower - mass ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "others have found that barred galaxies lie systematically below the @xmath0@xmath1  relation of normal unbarred galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and still others have found deviations in both the slope and intercept for galaxies hosting pseudobulges ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the idea of a non - universal @xmath0@xmath1  relation has been supported by theoretical work as well ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has also suggested that the relation may depend on environment .",
    "morphological deviations from a single @xmath0@xmath1  relation have also been claimed in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there has been some question as to whether or not objects at the high - mass / high-@xmath1  end of the relation follow a different slope ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , four out of the six objects with @xmath0  above 10@xmath14 _",
    "@xmath15  included in the study of @xcite lie significantly above the relation .",
    "the appearance of outliers could be due to systematic errors in @xmath1  or @xmath0  measurements , or simply a fluke due to small number statistics .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that offsets at the high - mass end may be due to a selection bias .",
    "specifically , when a sample is selected based on agn properties , one is more likely to find a high - mass bh in a lower - mass galaxy ( based on a bh  host galaxy correlation ) because high mass galaxies are rare and there is intrinsic scatter in bh  host galaxy correlations .",
    "an important step in evaluating the @xmath0@xmath1  relation and any possible deviations from it is to obtain secure @xmath1  and @xmath0  measurements in agns that sample the entire mass range of the relation .",
    "while the high - mass end of the quiescent @xmath0@xmath1  relation is relatively well - populated to beyond 10@xmath16 _",
    "@xmath15  ( @xcite ) , the current sample of agns used to calculate @xmath2 still contains just three or four objects with @xmath0  above 10@xmath14 _ @xmath15(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more measurements for luminous agns are needed to measure the high - mass end of the agn @xmath0@xmath1  relation . however , accurate @xmath1  measurements for high - luminosity agns are difficult to obtain because the agn light overpowers the light from the host .",
    "moreover , more luminous agns are relatively scarce and thus typically found at large distances , so the host galaxy has a small angular size and is easily lost in the glare of the agn .",
    "it is only in the past few years that high - precision measurements in very luminous objects have been obtained on account of the availability of adaptive optics ( ao ) and integral field spectrographs ( ifus ) such as gemini north s near - infrared integral field spectrometer ( nifs ) combined with the gemini north laser guide star ao system , altair .",
    "@xcite used nifs+altair to measure @xmath1  for pg1426 + 015 with much higher precision than previous measurements for high - luminosity quasars .",
    "this success prompted us to undertake additional observations of quasars at the high - mass end of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our nifs observations of eight high - luminosity quasars .",
    "we successfully measured @xmath1  in four objects and use these results to improve the population of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation at the high - mass end .",
    "we also recalculate virial products for the entire agn sample with updated time lag measurements to re - derive @xmath2 , calibrate black hole masses in agns , and reexamine the agn @xmath0@xmath1  relation . in this work",
    "we adopt a cosmological model of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 km sec@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 .",
    "observations of eight quasars were carried out at the gemini north telescope in 2008 and 2010 under the programs gn-2008b - q-28 , gn-2010a - q-11 , and gn-2010b - q-24 .",
    "we chose our sample from the database of objects with rm - based black hole mass measurements from @xcite with @xmath0  @xmath21 10@xmath14 _ @xmath15 .",
    "basic information on our targets is given in table [ table : tbl1 ] .",
    "we used nifs in conjunction with the altair laser guide star ao system to carry out our observations .",
    "nifs has a 3@xmath22 3  field of view that is divided into 29 individual spectroscopic slices , with a spectral resolution @xmath23 = @xmath24 @xmath25 5290 in both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands . with the ao correction ,",
    "nifs yields a spatial resolution on the order of 0.1 .",
    "there are several strong stellar absorption lines that fall within the wavelength range of the @xmath26 band , which has a central wavelength of 1.65 @xmath28 m and covers from about 1.49 @xmath28 m to 1.80 @xmath28 m , so we observed seven of our targets with the @xmath26 band filter .",
    "we list the most prominent stellar absorption features in this wavelength region in table [ table : tbl3 ] .",
    "we observed our eighth object , pg1700 + 518 , in the @xmath27 band due to its higher redshift .",
    "the @xmath27 filter on nifs covers from about 1.99 @xmath28 m to 2.40 @xmath28 m .",
    "we estimated the integration time for each object with @xmath29 acs or wfpc2 images of the sources from @xcite . to simulate the data we would obtain from nifs , we measured the flux within a 3x 3  aperture , except for a central circle of diameter 0.2 .",
    "we estimated the exposure time for each object based on its brightness relative to pg 1426 + 015 , for which @xcite obtained a host - galaxy signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 200 in about two hours of on - source integration . with both poisson and background - limited trials",
    ", we estimated the integration time required for each object to obtain a @xmath30 @xmath31 200 .",
    "table [ table : tbl2 ] gives details of the observations , most notably the on - source integration time for each object .",
    "reconstructed images from the ifu spectra of all eight targets are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we observed telluric standard stars ( usually a0v ) once every 1.5 hours for the purpose of telluric corrections .",
    "data were processed through the standard nifs pipeline from the gemini iraf package .",
    "our reductions deviated from the standard pipeline tasks in only two ways .",
    "first , we found that the original sky frames did not adequately remove sky lines from our spectra . to remedy this , we manually scaled the individual sky spectra to obtain better sky subtraction in each individual object frame .",
    "second , to remove stellar absorption lines in our telluric spectra , we used methods described by @xcite and applied in the idl - based code _ xtellcor_. this code uses a theoretical model of vega to remove the hydrogen features in our telluric standard spectra , and is specifically written for use with a0v stars .    to separate the host - galaxy spectra from the agns",
    ", we extract the spectrum from an annulus that excludes the quasar - dominated nucleus .",
    "the use of ao in these observations allowed us in most cases to confine at least the core of the quasar flux to the very central pixels of the image .",
    "generally , the ao - assisted seeing was on the order of @xmath32 , so we used either a @xmath33 , 0.3 , or @xmath34  inner radius ( @xmath35 ) to isolate the quasar component . the outer radius for each extraction annulus ( @xmath36 )",
    "was chosen to include as much host galaxy light as possible while minimizing the amount of noise contributed by the sky . for most of our objects",
    ", we evaluated this by eye and chose windows that minimized noise .",
    "however , in the targets where we could see identifiable galactic absorption lines , we chose @xmath35 and @xmath36 to obtain the highest equivalent width measurements in the visible absorption lines . @xmath35 and @xmath36 for each object",
    "are listed in table [ table : tbl4 ] and are shown on the reconstructed images in figure 1 .",
    "the total galaxy+quasar spectra for all eight objects , extracted from within a radius of @xmath36 , are shown in the top panels of figure  2 .",
    "although the use of the altair ao system helps confine the nuclear light to the central few pixels of the image , the ao - corrected psf still has nuclear light in its wings .",
    "typical strehl ratios for the altair ao system are on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 in the @xmath26 band ( @xcite ) . for a typical strehl ratio of 0.2 , @xcite report a 50% encircled psf energy radius of about 0.4 ; i.e. , half of the quasar light falls in a radius outside 0.4 .",
    "thus , there is still significant quasar contamination in the host - galaxy spectra . to further remove the quasar emission , we scaled and subtracted the nuclear spectrum from our annulus in each target .",
    "the scaling was done empirically  we chose a scale factor that best eliminated the most prominent quasar emission lines seen in the spectra . our final nucleus - subtracted , observed - frame spectra of all eight objects are shown in the bottom panels of figure  2 .",
    "note that while the spectrograph coverage in the @xmath26 band extends from about 1.48 @xmath28 m  to 1.8 @xmath28 m , in some cases the telluric contamination was sufficiently significant that we cropped the spectra before using them .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the @xmath26-band spectra shown in figure  2 is not uniform for this reason .",
    "we used the penalized pixel fitting method ( ppxf ) of @xcite to measure @xmath6 .",
    "this method convolves a stellar template spectrum and a line - of - sight velocity distribution to model the host galaxy .",
    "the best line - of - sight velocity distribution is calculated in the ppxf code with a @xmath37 minimization technique .",
    "the velocity templates used to make our measurements were obtained by @xcite , and include stars of four different spectral classes : k0iii , k5iii , m1iii , and m5ia .",
    "the k5iii , m1iii , and m5ia templates all resulted in somewhat similar fits in each spectrum  the reduced @xmath38 values of the fit in these three cases were always very close to one another , with the k5iii template usually a slightly better fit than the other two .",
    "the k0iii template provided a poor fit to the co(3 - 0 ) absorption line in all objects and was therefore not used in our analysis",
    ".    there are several different factors that affect the uncertainty in @xmath6 .",
    "first , no single stellar template is expected to be a perfect match to the host - galaxy stellar absorption features .",
    "we therefore adopt the average @xmath1  value from the three templates as our estimate , and fold the differences into our uncertainties .",
    "one exception to this is mrk 509 , for which the k5iii template provided a significantly better fit .",
    "we take the standard deviation in @xmath1  reported by the ppxf software among the three stellar templates as representative of the template mismatch uncertainty .",
    "we also consider the location of @xmath39 = 1 in the fitting a component of our uncertainties . to do this , we allowed @xmath1  to vary but held the rest of the parameters fixed at their best - fit values .",
    "we identified the value of @xmath1  at which the @xmath38 had changed by @xmath3 1 from the best - fit value , and took the average difference between these two values and our best - fit value as our uncertainty .",
    "because our measurements for pg1411 + 442 and pg1617 + 175 were made with spectra that are significantly noisier than the other two spectra , we also include a signal - to - noise ( @xmath30 ) component in our uncertainties for those two objects .",
    "to estimate this component , we degraded our two best spectra ( mrk 509 and pg2130 + 099 ) to match the @xmath30 in pg1617 + 175 and pg1411 + 442 . we then re - measured @xmath1  in the degraded spectra and took the deviation from our original measurements to represent the @xmath30 component of the uncertainties . for most of the templates",
    ", the @xmath1  measurements tended to be overestimated in the degraded spectra by about 20 ^-1 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we combine the 1@xmath40 uncertainties , the template mismatch uncertainties , and any @xmath30 component in quadrature and adopt these as our formal uncertainties .",
    "we measured @xmath1  from the spectra of four of our objects : mrk 509 , pg1411 + 442 , pg1617 + 175 , and pg2130 + 099 , and these values are listed in table [ table : tbl4 ] .",
    "the normalized galaxy spectra and the best - fit broadened stellar templates for these four objects are shown in figure  3 .",
    "our measurement for pg2130 + 099 of 147 @xmath3 17 km s@xmath20 constitutes a significant improvement in precision over its previous measurement of 172 @xmath3 46 km s@xmath20 ( @xcite ) , while mrk 509 and pg1411 + 442 have no previous measurements reported in the literature .",
    "our measurement for pg1617 + 175 of 201 @xmath3 37 km@xmath20 is slightly more precise but consistent with measurements made by @xcite , who report @xmath1  = 183 @xmath3 47 km s@xmath20 . in the other four objects",
    ", we were unable to identify any absorption lines in our nucleus - subtracted spectra and were unable to fit stellar templates and recover @xmath6 .",
    "we believe this was caused mainly by the overwhelming strength of the quasar emission in these objects and a lack of strong absorption lines within the observed wavelength range .",
    "these four objects are also the most distant of the eight we observed . in an attempt to minimize the quasar contamination , we experimented with different radii for both the inner and outer regions in these objects , but in all cases were unable to remove the quasar contamination enough to see absorption in the host galaxy spectrum . even when subtracting off a scaled nuclear spectrum to eliminate the emission lines , we see only noise ( with residual sky and telluric contamination",
    "; see figure  2 ) in the spectra of objects in which we were unable to measure @xmath6 .    because we optimized our extraction radii to obtain the best host - galaxy - to - quasar ratio , our @xmath1  measurements were made within different effective physical apertures for each target .",
    "the measurements for mrk 509 , pg1411 + 442 , and pg1617 + 175 were made within an effective physical aperture of 1.25 kpc , 3.2 kpc , and 3.3 kpc respectively .",
    "the effective radii ( @xmath41 ) for the spheroid components of these three objects from the surface decompositions of @xcite are 1.85 kpc , 5.05 kpc , and 3.3 kpc , so our apertures for these three objects lie between , or very close to , the commonly quoted aperture sizes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . however , the measurement for pg2130 + 099 was made within 1.64 kpc , which is 4.3 times @xmath41 for this object .",
    "we apply the relation derived by @xcite to determine the velocity dispersion within the effective radius ( @xmath43 ) for all four objects .",
    "these values are listed in table [ table : tbl4 ] for comparison with our measurements . for mrk 509 , pg1411 + 442 , and pg1617 + 175",
    ", there is very little difference between our measured @xmath1  and @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 for pg2130 + 099 is notably higher than our quoted value , but the change does not qualitatively affect our analysis .",
    "we use the corrected @xmath1  measurements ( @xmath43 ) for the subsequent discussion and analysis .",
    "there are now 30 reverberation - mapped agns with @xmath1  measurements .",
    "the virial products for most of these objects were calculated from time lags that were determined with traditional cross correlation methods ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite recently introduced a different method to determine time lags that they called stochastic process estimation for agn reverberation ( spear ) .",
    "this method works as follows : we assume all emission - line light curves are scaled and shifted versions of the continuum light curve .",
    "the continuum is modeled as an autoregressive process using a damped random walk ( drw ) model , which has shown to be a good statistical model of quasar variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the transfer function is modeled as a simple top - hat function .",
    "we fit the continuum and emission - line light curves simultaneously , maximizing the likelihood of the model using bayesian markov chain monte carlo iterations .",
    "the main advantage of the spear method is that it treats gaps in the temporal coverage of light curves in a statistically self - consistent way , so the gaps in the data are filled in a well - defined manner with well - defined uncertainties .",
    "@xcite re - measured the time lags in reverberation - mapped agns with the spear method and demonstrated its ability to recover accurate time lags .",
    "the method has since been successfully used to improve rm measurements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and even recover velocity - delay maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "because many of the light curves from the agn @xmath0@xmath1  sample , particularly high - luminosity objects , have large gaps , we went through and re - determined the virial products for the entire sample with updated h@xmath44  time lags recovered with the spear method .",
    "eighteen of the objects already have h@xmath44  time lags from @xcite . for eight of the remaining objects",
    ", we applied the same spear method with the latest version of the software called javelinyingzu / codes.html#javelin ] to calculate new time lags and virial products .",
    "three of the remaining agns have recently - published virial products calculated with the spear method , so we use the published virial products for 3c390.3 from @xcite , 3c120 from @xcite , and pg2130 + 099 from @xcite .",
    "we do not have the light curve for mrk 50 , so for this object we use the virial product from @xcite .",
    "all recalculated time lags , original line widths , and updated virial products for each rm data set are given in table [ table : tbl5 ] .",
    "for objects with just one measurement , we use that virial product . for objects with multiple measurements ,",
    "we adopt the mean of the logarithm of the virial products . in table",
    "[ table : tbl6 ] we show the adopted virial products and @xmath1  measurements for the entire sample .    in most cases ,",
    "the updated virial products are very similar to the previously - quoted values .",
    "the median fractional change in the virial products due to the updated time lags is about 18% , and the majority of these changes are consistent to within the measurement errors . for eight of the objects ,",
    "the virial products changed somewhat significantly .",
    "the largest increase was for 3c390.3 , for which the new virial product increased by factor of almost five over the previous measurement .",
    "most of these eight objects had light curves with significant gaps at key locations in the light curves that likely interfered with the time lag determinations .",
    "we do not see any systematic increase or decrease in the fractional change as a function of virial product ( i.e. , the virial products did not increase more in objects with larger virial products , or vice versa , in general ) , but we do note that the virial products of both of the highest - mass objects , 3c390.3 and pg1426 + 015 , both increased substantially from previous measurements .",
    "the objects for which we successfully measure @xmath1  ( pg1411 + 442 , pg1617 + 175 , mrk 509 , and pg2130 + 099 ) are the four lowest - redshift galaxies in our sample .",
    "mrk 509 and pg2130 + 099 have the highest @xmath30 host - galaxy spectra , with an average @xmath30 per pixel of @xmath31 250 for mrk 509 and @xmath31 190 for pg2130 + 099 .",
    "these have the most easily identifiable galaxy absorption features in our sample ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "the higher - luminosity quasars , pg1411 + 442 and pg1617 + 175 , have lower @xmath30 , specifically a @xmath30 of 100 per pixel in pg1617 + 175 and 130 per pixel in pg1411 + 442 , which is lower than our anticipated @xmath30 .",
    "although we made several attempts to fit and remove sky features , residual sky contamination and telluric absorption lines remain in the subtracted spectra , which makes the velocity dispersion measurements more uncertain and contributes to the lower @xmath30 of the spectra .",
    "we also see stronger quasar emission features which we were unable to eliminate entirely from the host - galaxy spectra .",
    "there seems to be three main factors that compromise the quality of our host galaxy spectra .",
    "first , we were unable to satisfactorily remove the sky emission from the spectra in all eight targets .",
    "this caused a significant decrease in @xmath30 in all of our spectra .",
    "secondly , in three of our objects , pg0026 + 129 , pg1126 + 023 , and pg0052 + 251 , many of the strong stellar absorption features that allow us to measure @xmath1  were redshifted out of the @xmath26-band .",
    "this limited us to very few absorption lines , and these few remaining lines fell in regions with severe telluric contamination .",
    "as such , we did not detect any absorption and were unable to measure @xmath1  in these objects .",
    "third , and possibly most importantly , in these four objects the quasar contamination becomes strong enough to overwhelm the host galaxy flux despite our long integrations and attempts to optimize the extraction radius . to quantify the amount of quasar contamination remaining in the original extraction annuli of these spectra , we estimated the ratio of the quasar flux to the host flux , both within our extraction radius , for the case of pg0026 + 129 .",
    "we based this calculation on measurements of the psf magnitude , host galaxy magnitude , and host galaxy sersic index reported by @xcite from their analysis of @xmath29 nicmos @xmath26-band images .",
    "we integrate the sersic profile over the extraction annulus used in our study ( for pg0026 + 129 , we used an inner radius of 0.2and an outer radius of 0.6 , corresponding to 0.62 and 1.86 kpc , respectively ) to estimate the amount of host flux inside our aperture .",
    "given the previously discussed findings of @xcite , we assume that half of the psf light falls inside the annulus and find that the psf flux inside the extraction annulus is a factor of 4.5 times the amount of host flux inside the extraction annulus .",
    "we expect similar , possibly even more , contamination in the other targets for which we were unsuccessful , and thus this contamination limits our ability to explore the hosts of quasars at the high end of the luminosity distribution .",
    "while we appear to have reached the limit of the nifs+altair system for these measurements , ao systems continue to move towards diffraction - limited resolution with high strehl ratios .",
    "these advances may lead to successful measurements with similar exposure times .",
    "the future availability of the @xmath45  ( @xmath46 ) may also lead to successful attempts at @xmath1  measurements in high - luminosity quasars .",
    "@xmath46 is currently expected to launch in 2018 and will be equipped with an ifu spectrograph of sufficient resolution , and the major problems of sky and telluric contamination , which were prohibitive for our higher - redshift targets , will be completely eliminated in space . observing from space will allow us to see the whole spectrum continuously , so we will not be limited to specific redshift windows , and will also include the caii  triplet region .",
    "@xmath46 will offer a compact , stable psf , and will have more sensitivity than our current equipment and thus offers much promise for future efforts to measure @xmath1  in high - luminosity , high - redshift agns .",
    "it is also possible that the host galaxies of the four quasars in which we were unable to measure @xmath1  were simply fainter galaxies with lower @xmath6 .",
    "if this is the case , excluding them in our subsequent examination of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation could result in a bias in the distribution at the high-@xmath0  end . as a separate check on the expected velocity dispersions of these hosts ( as well as the rest of the sample ) , we place the entire rm sample on the @xcite relation ( hereafter the faber - jackson relation ) , which is the correlation between @xmath1  and the absolute magnitude or luminosity of the host bulge .",
    "some of the galaxies had already - published absolute @xmath47-band magnitudes from @xcite , and we used host galaxy decompositions by @xcite and @xcite to determine the bulge magnitudes in the rest ( except mrk 50 , which was not included in these studies ) . to compare our sample with a previous determination of the faber - jackson relation by @xcite , we convert our magnitudes to the @xmath48 band .",
    "the @xmath29 observations @xcite were taken using the acs f550 m filter and the wfpc2 f547 m filter , while the images used by @xcite were taken with the wfpc2 f814w filter .",
    "we use the iraf package @xmath49 with bulge templates from @xcite to determine the @xmath50 and @xmath51 colors for each galaxy type and use this to transform our bulge magnitudes to the magnitude in the f814w filter , which is extremely close to the @xmath48 band .",
    "figure  4 shows our rm sample on the faber - jackson relation from @xcite , which was calculated with the sample from @xcite .",
    "the rm sample as a whole appears to follow this relation , with some scatter .",
    "we use the same relation measured by @xcite with the sample from @xcite to calculate the expected @xmath1  values for the four objects in which we were unable to measure @xmath6 .",
    "as figure  4 shows , the hosts of the four targets in wich we were unable to measure @xmath1  are some of the most luminous in the sample , and thus the predicted @xmath1  values are quite high .",
    "as such , we conclude that our inability to measure @xmath1  in these objects is most likely due to the high agn luminosities and high redshifts of the systems and not due to systematically fainter host galaxies in these targets .",
    "it is important again to note that measuring bulge properties in agn , particularly at the high - luminosity end of the distribution , is very difficult , and thus the bulge luminosities themselves are subject to large uncertainties .",
    "because we have updated the virial products in the agn @xmath0@xmath1  sample and added a few objects at the high - luminosity end of the distribution , we also present an updated measurement of the average virial factor @xmath2 used to calibrate the agn @xmath0  scale . in order to measure @xmath2",
    ", we assume that the agn @xmath0@xmath1  relation follows the same slope as quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , previous studies have found that agns appear to follow a slightly shallower relation than quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we measure the slope of the relation between the virial product , @xmath52 , and @xmath6 : @xmath53 with our updated agn sample .",
    "we use the traditional forward regression for our calculation : we consider @xmath1  as the independent variable and @xmath0  the dependent variable . using the fitexy algorithm ( @xcite ) to fit the agn relation , we obtain @xmath54 .",
    "this slope is steeper than found in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite , who report @xmath44 = 3.46 @xmath3 0.61 ) , and is slightly flatter than but consistent with the most recent measurement of the slope in quiescent galaxies of 5.31 @xmath3 0.33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then use fitexy to determine the @xmath11 necessary to place the agn sample on the same @xmath0@xmath1  relation as quiescent galaxies .",
    "using our updated agn sample , we obtain log  @xmath2  =  0.63  @xmath3  0.11 , corresponding to @xmath2  =  4.31  @xmath3  1.05 . this number is slightly lower than , but consistent with , the recent values found by @xcite and @xcite and is in closer agreement with that found by @xcite when using a forward regression analysis .",
    "however , @xcite also raised the issue of a potential sample selection bias in the @xmath0@xmath1  relation  specifically , there are no @xmath1  measurements in objects with @xmath0  @xmath55 _ @xmath15 , causing a bias against low-@xmath0  systems .",
    "they use an inverse regression approach to avoid this selection bias .",
    "we prefer a forward regression because the @xmath0@xmath1  relation is typically used to determine @xmath0  in galaxies with measured @xmath6 .",
    "we use our new value of @xmath2 = 4.31 to transform the virial products of the agn sample to @xmath0 .",
    "we place our four objects with successful @xmath1  measurements on the @xmath0@xmath1  relation in figure  5 , with the rest of the agn sample shown for comparison .",
    "we also show the most recent quiescent @xmath0@xmath1  relation from @xcite .",
    "we see that all four of our objects lie within the expected scatter of the relation , and see no evidence for an offset in the objects at the high end of the relation . because we were unable to obtain @xmath1  measurements for our highest-@xmath0  objects , we fall short of our original goal of densely populating the very high end of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , though we do increase the sample of objects with 10@xmath14  _",
    "@xmath15@xmath56 @xmath0  @xmath57 _ @xmath15 .",
    "as noted in previous studies , the agn sample is still biased towards objects with relatively lower masses than the majority of the quiescent galaxies with dynamical mass measurements .",
    "a morphological or environmental dependence of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation could have important implications on the use of a single mean @xmath10 factor to transform the virial product , @xmath52 , into @xmath0  in agns . to test",
    "whether or not the agn sample shows any morphology - dependent effects , we divided our agn sample into different groups to see if there was any visible offset or change in slope in the @xmath0@xmath1  relation . in the left panel of figure  6 , we divide the agn sample into two groups : those suspected of hosting a pseudobulge , and those thought to host a classical spheroid at their centers . in the right panel",
    ", we divide the sample based on whether or not a central bar is observed .",
    "we classified the galaxies using the host - galaxy decompositions from @xcite ( see their table 4 ) .",
    "following @xcite , the galaxies were inspected for the presence of the following pseudobulge indicators : flattened bulge morphology , the presence of a nuclear bar , a low ( @xmath58 ) sersic index , and the presence of copious dust and star formation in the nucleus without any signature of an ongoing merger .",
    "none of these indicators by themselves constitute sufficient evidence that a bulge is a pseudobulge .",
    "therefore , we assumed that galaxies with most of these indicators host a pseudobulge , and galaxies with few or none of these indicators host a classical bulge .",
    "our classifications are listed in table [ table : tbl6 ] .",
    "it should be noted that host galaxy classifications are particularly difficult to make in high - luminosity quasar hosts , and some galaxies in our sample show signs of disturbed morphologies , so our classifications are somewhat uncertain .",
    "we do not see any signs of an offset in either the galaxies hosting pseudobulges or the galaxies with central bars , unlike several studies that were previously noted in our introduction .",
    "if we determine @xmath2 with our samples of barred and unbarred galaxies separately , we obtain a result similar to that of @xcite .",
    "namely , the galaxies with bars in them yield a lower value ( @xmath2  =  3.07  @xmath3  1.00 ) than the galaxies without central bars ( @xmath59  =  5.92  @xmath3  1.80 ) .",
    "however , the barred sample lacks any objects with @xmath0  @xmath60 _ @xmath15and similarly , the unbarred sample has only three objects with @xmath0  below 10@xmath61 _ @xmath15 .",
    "observations of the megamaser sample by @xcite show that about half of their host galaxies ( with @xmath0  @xmath62 _ @xmath15 ) fall below the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , which again demonstrates that different samples yield different results .",
    "in addition , @xcite and this work have demonstrated that extending the sample to cover the entire @xmath0  range can significantly impact the measured slopes and mean virial factor , and as such we conclude the difference seen in our samples is not statistically significant due to the systematic uncertainties associated with the lack of a substantial dynamic range in @xmath5 .",
    "we measured @xmath1  in four quasars at the high - mass end of the agn @xmath0@xmath1  distribution .",
    "the measurements of mrk 509 and pg1411 + 442 are the first ever @xmath1  measurements for these targets , and the measurements for pg1617 + 175 and pg2130 + 099 are updates with improved precision .",
    "we were unable to measure @xmath1  in the spectra of our highest - redshift objects due to substantial contamination of the host - galaxy spectra by the quasar nucleus and poor sky line subtraction .",
    "future measurements of @xmath1  for high - luminosity qsos will require improved ao technology , substantially longer integration times , or @xmath46 .",
    "we also updated the virial products for the agn @xmath0@xmath1  sample with recalculated time lags from the spear method of @xcite and recalculated the mean virial factor @xmath11 used to calibrate the agn @xmath0  scale .",
    "we obtained log @xmath2 = 0.63 @xmath3 0.11 , corresponding to @xmath11  =  4.31 @xmath3 1.05 .",
    "this is consistent with previous results based on forward regression methods . with our new @xmath1  measurements ,",
    "all four of our objects fall within the expected scatter of the quiescent @xmath0@xmath1  relation .",
    "we find no evidence in agns for a morphology - based deviation from the standard quiescent @xmath0@xmath1  relation .",
