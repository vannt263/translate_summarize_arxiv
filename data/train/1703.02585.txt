    "indeed , the data from @xmath203 to @xmath204 nicely fit the ansatz @xmath205 with @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , i.e. @xmath206 , see the inset of fig .  [ fss ] .",
    "in particular , considering @xmath0 as a free parameter , we obtain a consistent value with an accuracy of a few per cent , i.e. @xmath207 using all available data , with an acceptable @xmath208 .    then , we compute the ratio @xmath209 for various values of @xmath43 and @xmath130 .",
    "the fss hypothesis implies that @xmath192 must approach a scaling function of @xmath189 , cf .",
    "( [ zdef ] ) .",
    "this is nicely supported by the data reported in fig .",
    "this fss analysis shows that the condition @xmath210 is sufficient to provide the @xmath211 limit of @xmath85 within approximately one per cent .",
    "we finally note that the problem that we consider , i.e. the critical behavior at the boundary of the bec region , differs from the phenomena of boundary critical behaviors at the boundaries of statistical systems  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the inhomogeneous behavior arises from the presence of the boundaries . in the case that we study the inhomogeneous critical behavior is controlled by the external effectively linear potential , giving rise to a critical region of size @xmath212 separating the bec and normal - phase regions .",
    "we investigate some aspects of the bec of quantum gases in the presence of inhomogeneous conditions , such as cold - atom systems in harmonic traps , which are typically realized in experiments , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "we consider 3d bosonic gases trapped by an external potential , when the temperature is sufficiently low to show a superfluid phase region around the center of the trap . in particular , we consider 3d bh models in the presence of a harmonic trap , cf .",
    "( [ bhmt ] ) , which model realistic gases of bosonic atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "we point out that , if the trap is sufficiently large , different phases may coexist in different space regions , when moving from the center of the trap .",
    "for example , we may pass from the superfluid bec phase around the center of the trap ( where space coherence is essentially described by spin waves ) to a normal phase far from the center . between the superfluid and normal phase regions the quantum gas experiences a _ spatial _ phase transition .",
    "the system develops a peculiar critical behavior at the surface separating the different phases , characterized by the presence of an external potential with an effectively linear space dependence .",
    "using scaling arguments , we put forward the asymptotic behavior in the limit of smooth external potential , i.e. , large length scale @xmath82 associated with the effective linear variation of the potential at the critical surface , cf .",
    "( [ vedef ] ) .",
    "we argue that this peculiar scaling behavior is controlled by the universality class of the homogenous bec transition , i.e. , the 3d xy universality class whose critical exponents are known with great accuracy .",
    "the length scale @xmath85 of the critical modes around the critical surface diverges as @xmath213 with @xmath214 , where  @xcite @xmath29 is the correlation - length critical exponent of the 3d xy universality class .",
    "we provide numerical evidence of this phenomenon for the 3d bh model in the hard - core @xmath10 limit ( whose phase diagram is sketched in fig .",
    "[ 3dphasedia ] ) , in the presence of a rotationally - invariant harmonic trap .",
    "the numerical results , obtained by qmc simulations , nicely support our scaling predictions , in particular those at the boundary of the bec .",
    "an analogous scenario is expected for soft - core bh models with finite on - site interaction parameters @xmath59 .",
    "the scaling theory at the boundary of the bec can be straightforwardly extended to different geometries of the trap , and/or generic space dependences of the external potential .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the linear approximation at the spatial surface between the two phases is quite general .",
    "moreover , high - order terms are expected to be irrelevant : they give only rise to @xmath103 suppressed contribution in the @xmath215 limit .",
    "we remark that the lattice structure of the bh model does not play any particular role in our scaling arguments concerning the spatial phase transition at the boundary of the bec , and the derivation of the corresponding power laws .",
    "indeed the microscopic details of the model are irrelevant in the asymptotic @xmath215 limit .",
    "therefore , our scaling predictions at the boundary of the bec apply to a wide class of models , i.e. to any 3d inhomogeneous interacting bosonic systems at the spatial boundary of their bec phase .",
    "the experimental evidence of the critical behavior at the boundary of the bec in trapped quantum gases requires the measurement of the one - particle correlation functions , or higher - order correlations .",
    "these quantities are not easily accessible .",
    "however several examples of such space - coherence measurements have been reported in the literature , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . on the other hand , the more accessible particle density , which can be measured by _ in situ _ density image techniques  @xcite ,",
    "can hardly provide evidence of this critical phenomenon , since the critical modes give only rise to subleading contributions to the particle density , cf .",
    "( [ rhorb ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 can be inferred by a scaling analysis of the perturbation @xmath216 representing the external linear potential @xmath217 coupled to the particle density .",
    "we follow the field - theoretical approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , that is we consider the 3d @xmath218 quantum field theory which represents the 3d xy universality class , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath219 , \\label{hphi4}\\ ] ] where @xmath220 is the complex field associated with the order parameter , and @xmath221 are coupling constants .",
    "since the particle density corresponds to the energy operator @xmath222 , we can write the perturbation @xmath216 as @xmath223 introducing the renormalization - group dimension @xmath224 of the constant @xmath225 of the linear potential , we derive the scaling relation @xmath226 , where @xmath99 is the rg dimension of the density / energy operator @xmath222 ( we recall that @xmath27 is the length - scale critical exponent of the 3d xy universality class ) .",
