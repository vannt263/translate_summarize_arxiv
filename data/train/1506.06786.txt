    "the laser - heated diamond anvil cell ( lhdac ) has been widely used to synthesize new materials and to study matter under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature.@xcite one of the main applications of the lhdac is the study of high pressure melting curves of elements and compounds.@xcite major advances in this technique in the last three decades have provided a valuable information on the melting curve of a wide variety of materials at pressures up to a few megabars and temperatures up to several thousands of degrees kelvin .",
    "special attention has been paid to the improvement of heating capability,@xcite temperature measurement,@xcite temperature control,@xcite minimization of temperature gradients within the sampled region,@xcite and the correct identification of the onset of melting.@xcite    despite the advances described above , many investigations of apparently simple materials have generated controversy due to disagreements among experiments,@xcite and between experiments and theory.@xcite some studies have identified possible errors in temperature measurement.@xcite others have found that chemical reactions or diffusion can alter the composition of the sample.@xcite in particular , the correct determination of the melting transition has been a highly controversial subject.@xcite a variety of melting criteria have been used , including visual observation of fluid motion in a speckle interference pattern,@xcite apearence of diffuse scattering via x - ray diffraction,@xcite appearance of plateaus in curves of temperature as a function of laser power,@xcite formation of glass or a change of texture upon quenching@xcite and changes in sample properties such as reflectivity , absorption@xcite and resistivity.@xcite among these , the first two are the most commonly used criteria .",
    "however , the use of x - ray diffraction in lhdac experiments is limited to large - scale synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "most small - scale laboratories therefore employ the direct fluid motion observation as the main melting criterion .",
    "it has been argued , however , that this criterion has two shortcomings .",
    "first , the precise identification of the onset of fluid motion can be difficult , resulting in an overestimated melting temperature.@xcite this becomes more pronounced as the pressure increases and fluid motion becomes more sluggish.@xcite it is thus important to define this criterion more objectively , based on quantitative measures .",
    "second , this criterion becomes increasingly subjective at temperatures above  @xmath2 , as intense thermal radiation makes it impractical to obtain a reliable image with adequate contrast across the hotspot within the sample.@xcite this limits the validity of this criterion to relatively low temperatures (  @xmath3 ) .",
    "in this paper we describe an image analysis procedure used to extract quantitative information on the speckle interference pattern .",
    "this allows us to define several quantitative measures , the abrupt change of which indicates the onset of melting . to further corroborate the correct melting point determination , we have also monitored the temperature as a function of laser power and interpreted plateaus or change of slope as the onset of melting",
    "this method is applied to the measurement of the melting curve of tellurium ( te ) up to  @xmath0 . at low pressures , up to  @xmath1 , our measurements are in excellent agreement with a previous measurement of the melting curve of te using large - volume press.@xcite furthermore , at higher pressures our measurements are in line with the solid - solid coexistence curve reported in ref .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we describe the experimental setup including the sample preparation procedure ( sec .  [ sec1a ] ) , the optical setup and temperature measurement ( sec .  [ sec1b ] ) , and the image analysis of the speckle interference pattern ( sec .",
    "[ sec1c ] ) .",
    "the measurement of the melting curve of te using this improved melting criterion is presented in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results and their implications in sec .",
    "samples of high purity te  ( @xmath4 ) were used without further treatment .",
    "the samples were cut and pressed between diamond culets to form pieces of  @xmath5 thickness and a diameter of about  @xmath6 .",
    "the samples were mounted in a dac with  @xmath7 diameter culets .",
    "rhenium gaskets , pre indented to  @xmath8 thickness were used .",
    "thermal isolation was achieved by loading a thermally isolated epoxy in the laser drilled @xmath9 diameter sample chamber and drilling with a  @xmath10 diameter drill bit .",
    "the bottom culet was covered with a  @xmath11 layer of ruby by crushing a large ruby grain between the bare culets . in some loads  @xmath12",
    "thick kcl plates were used as an additional thermal isolation layer .",
    "the sample was topped with a few  @xmath13 ruby chips and the top diamond was mounted on it .",
    "finally , the cell was cryogenically loaded with  @xmath4 argon as a pressurization medium .",
    "the optical setup is shown schematically in fig.[fig_opt_meas ] ; see ref .   for more details .",
    "cw nd : yag laser is focused to form a hotspot @xmath8 in diameter at the center of the sample . a homemade ir pyrometer , designed for measurements down to 500k,@xcite is used to measure the hotspot peak temperature . thermal radiation emitted by the hotspot",
    "is collected from a small area ( @xmath14 in diameter ) at the center of the hotspot into a gaas photodiode ( thorlabs d10 m ) . in order to ensure thermal equilibrium conditions , the thermal radiation",
    "is collected @xmath15 seconds after exposing the sample to the heating laser beam .",
    "the thermal radiation intensity is measured at @xmath16 different wavelengths in the spectral range  @xmath17 using narrow band filters .",
    "the temperature is calculated by fitting the measured spectrum to planck s spectral radiance law @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wavelength , @xmath20 is the temperature , @xmath21 is the sample emissivity and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are planck s constant , boltzman s constant and the speed of light , respectively . invoking the grey body approximation which assumes @xmath25 to be a constant independent of wavelength and temperature",
    ", we fit the measured spectrum to eq .   using two free parameters , the constant emissivity and the temperature . at fixed pressure and hotspot within the sample",
    ", temperatures are measured with increasing heating beam power .",
    "it should be noted that the emissivity extracted in this fitting procedure is an effective emissivity , which is strongly affected by the surface texture and local optical properties of the hotspot . at the melting transition",
    "the surface texture changes and the effective emissivity can vary and generate errors in the temperature measurement . for better accuracy of the temperature measurement",
    "we perform a second temperature calculation after completing a series of temperature measurements at the same hotspot ; each temperature in the series is recalculated assuming a common emissivity , which serves as a single free parameter for a series of measurements at the given hotspot .",
    "having determined the melting point ( see details in the next section ) for each series of measurements , we extract the value of the emissivity by fitting the measured spectra to eq .   for temperatures below the melting point .",
    "the extracted solid phase emissivity is then used to calculate the temperatures of all the measurements in the series .",
    "temperatures measured above the melting point might have larger error due to this procedure .",
    "however , the melting temperature is determined by measurements carried out just before melting and in the vicinity of the melting transition .",
    "therefore , errors in temperature measurements above the melting point do not significantly affect the correct determination of the melting temperature .",
    "figure [ fig_temp_meas ] shows a series of temperature measurements , performed at a pressure of  @xmath26 , as a function of heating beam power .",
    "as can be observed , temperatures calculated using two free parameters for each measurement separately ( blue stars ) have strong fluctuations around the melting temperature , @xmath27 .",
    "once the melting point was determined and the temperatures were recalculated using a common emissivity ( red points in fig .",
    "[ fig_temp_meas ] ) , one can observe a plateau around the melting temperature of te . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig_temp_meas ] , temperatures below the melting point are not very sensitive to the fitting procedure ( the corrections are smaller than  @xmath28 ) , whereas variations between the two fitting procedures are significant for temperatures well above the melting point .    a second , longer plateau can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_temp_meas ] at @xmath29 .",
    "we attribute this plateau to the melting of ar , the pressure medium .",
    "we observed this second plateau in all measurements in which the sample was heated to the ar melting temperature and it occurred at temperatures consistent with the melting curve of ar.@xcite    . as a first approximation the temperature of each measurement is calculated by fitting the measured spectrum ( inset ) to a grey body spectral radiance formula ( blue diamonds ) .",
    "the temperature is then recalculated by fitting the series of measurements taken at the same position subject to the constraint of a common emissivity for the entire series ( red points ) .",
    "the dotted red lines correspond to the melting temperatures of te ( @xmath30k ) and ar ( @xmath31k ) . ]",
    "methods for detection of the onset of melting by observing changes in an image of the sample utilize either a speckle image during heating or a direct image after quenching in temperature.@xcite in the first method , changes in the speckle image are due to liquid motion once the hotspot is melted,@xcite whereas in the second method changes in the image originate from changes of texture once the sample is melted and resolidified.@xcite in both methods , the determination of the exact melting temperature is somewhat subject to personal interpretation . in order to avoid this subjectivity , we have developed an image analysis method to quantify changes in the speckle interference pattern .    for direct visual observation of melting the hotspot was illuminated with a hene laser beam , which generates a speckle interference pattern on a cmos camera ( fig .",
    "[ fig_opt_meas ] ) . at each heating beam power ,",
    "a series of 8 speckle pattern images was recorded by the cmos camera .",
    "laser line filter ( @xmath32 ) was used to prevent the heating laser beam and the thermal radiation from reaching the camera .    for a quantitative analysis of temporal changes in the speckle interference pattern ,",
    "the software calculates the standard deviation ( std ) , @xmath33 , of each pixel @xmath34 in the series of images , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of images , @xmath37 is the intensity of pixel @xmath34 in the @xmath38th image and @xmath39 is the averaged intensity of that pixel .",
    "the std per pixel is summed over a region of interest , giving a parameter that quantifies the amount of temporal changes generated during the heating process .",
    "the outcome was then compared to the corresponding quantity obtained for a second series of images recorded at room temperature in the absence of heating laser beam .",
    "typical plot of the temporal changes ( averaged std per pixel ) at the hotspot as a function of the measured temperature is shown in the middle panel of fig.[fig_melt_det ] .",
    "at low temperatures there is no apparent change in the std of the hotspot during heating and after cooling .",
    "such differences become evident as the heating beam power increases .",
    "the increasing differences are attributed to melting of the sample , since liquid motion at the hotspot gives rise to rapid changes in the speckle interference pattern , which in turn lead to increase in the std of the series of images recorded during heating .    for a more accurate determination of the onset of melting ,",
    "the speckle interference patterns were analyzed in a second way . typically , melting and resoldification of the sample result in changes of texture of the melted surface .",
    "this is reflected by a change in the speckle interference pattern after melting and resolidification .",
    "we have quantified such changes by measuring the correlation of the speckle interference pattern recorded at room temperature after each heating cycle , with respect to a reference speckle image recorded at the beginning of the experiment , prior to any heating process .",
    "the correlation coefficient , @xmath40 , is defined as @xmath41\\left[\\sum^{}_{i , j}\\left(z^{}_{ij}-\\overline{z}\\right)^{2}\\right]}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the intensity of pixel @xmath34 and the mean pixel value of the image recorded after a heating cycle , whereas @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the corresponding quantities of the reference image .",
    "a typical plot of this correlation as a function of the measured temperature is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_melt_det ] .",
    "one can clearly observe a drop in the correlation of the speckle interference patterns once the sample is melted .    to further corroborate the applicability of these two melting criteria",
    ", we also employed a third criterion by monitoring the changes in the slope of the temperature as a function of heating beam power ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_melt_det ] ) .",
    "this provides us with three independent criteria for the detection of melting , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_melt_det ] .    .",
    "the melting temperature is determined by using three distinct criteria : a. ( upper panel ) observation of changes in the slope of the temperature as a function of heating beam power .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the melting temperature b. ( middle panel ) an increase in the temporal vibrations of a series of speckle images taken at each temperature ( red line and dots ) with respect to temporal vibrations measured at room temperature after each heating cycle ( blue line and dots ) .",
    "c. ( lower panel ) a sharp decrease in the correlation of speckle images taken after heating the sample , with respect to a reference image taken before heating the sample .",
    "using these criteria the melting temperature in this measurement was determined to be @xmath46 ]",
    "the melting curve of te was previously studied in a large volume press up to @xmath1 , by means of differential thermal analysis,@xcite thermobaric analysis and electrical resistance measurements.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , no measurements of the melting curve of te using lhdac have been reported to date .",
    "typically , lhdac setups are designed for measurements of melting temperatures above  @xmath47 , utilizing appropriate optical components for thermal radiation in the visible range .",
    "measurements of melting temperatures below  @xmath47 require different optical components sensitive to thermal radiation in the ir range .",
    "our ir pyrometer , described in detail in ref . , was designed to extend the applicability of lhdac experiments to temperatures down to @xmath48 and is thus suitable for studying the melting curve of te at high pressures .    using the experimental setup described above",
    ", the melting curve of te was measured up to a pressure of  @xmath0 . at each pressure we repeated the measurement in at least  @xmath49 different positions on the sample surface . at each position , the melting temperature was determined using at least two of the criteria described in the previous section .",
    "the measured melting curve is shown in fig.[fig_melt_curve ] . with our improved melting criteria",
    ", we could determine the melting temperature with an estimated error of  @xmath28 .",
    "up to  @xmath1 our measurements agree with previous data.@xcite above this point until  @xmath50 the melting temperature increases with increasing pressure but its slope slightly decreases ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) . at  @xmath50 a small change of slope can be observed .",
    "this change of slope is possibly related , via the clausius - clapeyron relation , to a solid - solid phase transition ( the iv / v transition , see fig.[fig_melt_curve ] ) reported in ref . at temperatures up to  @xmath52 .",
    "extrapolation of the iv / v phase boundary ( dashed line in fig.[fig_melt_curve ] ) intersects the melting curve at  @xmath53 , in reasonable agreement with the pressure at which a change of slope occurs in the melting curve .     and",
    "the i / iii phase boundary reported in ref .",
    "are shown in dotted lines , whereas the iii / iv and iv / v phase boundaries from ref .",
    "are shown in solid lines . at room temperature ,",
    "@xcite its temperature dependence is less determined @xcite and is therefore omitted in the phase diagram plotted in fig.[fig_melt_curve ] ] the extrapolation of the iv / v phase boundary is plotted in dashed line . ]",
    "we have demonstrated a simple image analysis procedure to quantify changes in speckle interference patterns , which are widely used as a probe for the detection of melting transitions in lhdac experiments .",
    "two distinct quantities can be defined : 1 ) std of a series of images recorded during heating and 2 ) a correlation between an image recorded at room temperature after each heating cycle and a reference image recorded prior to heating .",
    "abrupt changes in these two quantities indicate the onset of liquid motion at the hotspot and changes of texture due to melting and resolidification , respectively .",
    "this method improves the reliability of melting criteria which are based on changes in an image of the hotsopt surface .",
    "the image analysis procedure was employed to measure the melting curve of te up to  @xmath0 .",
    "our measurements are in excellent agreement with previous measurement of the melting curve of te using large - volume press up to  @xmath1.@xcite at higher pressures our measurements are in line with the solid - solid coexistence curve , reported in ref .  .",
    "however , an additional study of the melting curve in this region is necessary in order to draw further conclusions .",
    "while the use of an image analysis to improve the accuracy of melting detection was demonstrated at relatively low temperatures ( below 1400k ) , the method should also be applicable to temperatures beyond the measured range ."
