    "although the basic concept of heat assisted recording ( hamr ) reaches back almost 60 years @xcite only very recently the first fully functional drive was realized with more than 1000 write power on hours @xcite and a 1.4tb / in@xmath0 device was demonstrated @xcite . in order to keep up the continuous increase of areal storage density ( ad ) the following factors are essential ( i ) provide small magnetic grains and ( ii ) provide a recording scheme with a high effective write field and temperature gradient in order to allow for small bit transitions . to realize small magnetic grains high magnetic anisotropy has to be used to ensure that the stored binary information is thermally stable .",
    "the limited maximum magnetic field of write heads results in the so called magnetic recording trilemma .",
    "hamr @xcite can help to overcome this trilemma .",
    "one uses a laser spot to locally heat the selected recording bit near or above the curie temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence , even the magnetization of very hard magnetic materials can be reversed with the available write fields .",
    "nevertheless , thermally written - in errors are a serious problem of hamr @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will show under which circumstances a bit patterned recording medium , consisting of hard magnetic single phase grains , can have an areal storage density of 10tb / in@xmath0 and more , despite thermal fluctuations at high temperatures during writing , which significantly deteriorates the bit transition , as well as the distribution of the curie temperature of the recording grain are considered .",
    "the accurate calculation of the magnetic behavior of a recording grain is a challenging task . during hamr temperatures near and above @xmath1 of the involved materials can occur , and thus a meaningful physical model should be able to reproduce the phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state at @xmath1 .",
    "we use the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation for this purpose , which has already been validated in different publications  @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the formulation proposed by evans  et  al .",
    "@xcite . to accelerate the simulations in order to provide an insight into the detailed switching behavior of realistic recording grains we use a coarse grained approach . for detailed information about the used coarse grained llb model",
    "please refer to @xcite . in summary , in the coarse grained llb model each material",
    "is described with just one magnetization vector . with this approach recording grains with realistic lateral dimensions of several nanometers",
    "can be efficiently simulated with low computational effort . nevertheless , the resulting dynamic trajectories reproduce the according computationally very expensive atomistic simulations .",
    ".magnetic properties of the hm recording grain . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : clsr_ber ] shows the final maximum ad with the corresponding parameters . shingled recording reaches the remarkable density of 14.34tb / in@xmath0 , which is more than twice the ad than for conventional recording .",
    "additionally we simulated the same footprint as in fig .",
    "[ fig : clsr_phase ] for a head velocity of 10 m/s fixing @xmath2 to 10 nm .",
    "the optimized ad for these calculations can also be found in tab .",
    "[ tab : clsr_ber ] for comparison .",
    "so far no interactions between the recording grains were considered , as the switching probabilities of fig .",
    "[ fig : clsr_phase ] are based on trajectories of just one bit . due to the small distances between the bits , the demagnetization field of neighboring grains",
    "can influence the effective write field of the recording head .",
    "our simulations show that a change in the applied magnetic field shifts the phase transition in fig .",
    "[ fig : clsr_phase ] along the peak temperature axis .",
    "additionally a slight broadening of the transition area for larger fields can be mentioned .",
    "the same effect is caused by a change of the curie temperature of the material .",
    "hence , we are able to include the interaction of the recording bits due to their demagnetization field in an additional distribution of @xmath1 . to quantify this effect",
    "we inspect a complete finite element model of bit b and its 24 nearest neighbors with @xmath3 nm and @xmath4 nm . the total field at b is calculated for 50000 configurations consisting of randomly chosen magnetization down and up directions of the neighbors .",
    "a histogram of the resulting field values allows to extract the underlying distribution and its standard deviation . with the computed shifts of the transitions in the switching probability diagrams for different applied fields",
    "the field distribution can be transferred to an additional distribution of the curie temperature . in total",
    "an increase of 5% in @xmath5 is obtained . as a consequence the ad of the bit patterned medium slightly decreases to 13.23tb / in@xmath0 for shingled and 6.62tb / in@xmath0 for conventional recording as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : clsr_ber ] . even in the more conservative scenario of a 10% increase of the @xmath1 distribution to @xmath6%@xmath1 the final ad does not significantly change .",
    "in summary , we used an efficient coarse grained llb model @xcite to calculate switching probabilities and bit error rates of hard magnetic ( fept like ) recording bits with a diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm during hamr . in our calculations we considered a distribution of the curie temperature of the recording grains , as well as a distribution of the grain size , its position and the position of the heat spot on the medium .",
    "we also included interactions between the bits in our calculations as additional contribution to the intrinsic @xmath1 distribution .",
    "hence , we obtained a realistic model of hamr , where we optimized the areal density in terms of the spacings between the bits and the write temperature of the heat spot .",
    "based on this model we presented a bit patterned recording medium , which reaches an areal storage density of 13.23tb / in@xmath0 for shingled and 6.62tb / in@xmath0 for conventional recording , if a heat spot with a full width at half maximum of 20 nm and a velocity of 7.5 m/s and an external magnetic field of 0.8 t is assumed .",

    "the support from the cd - laboratory amsen ( financed by the austrian federal ministry of economy , family and youth , the national foundation for research , technology and development ) was acknowledged .",
    "the computational results presented have been achieved using the vienna scientific cluster ( vsc ) .",
