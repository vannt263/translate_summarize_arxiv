    "the key feature of copper oxides is the layered structure and led to speculation that reduced dimensionality is a necessary prerequisite for superconductivity at temperatures above @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "although two dimensional ( @xmath8 ) models , such as @xmath1-@xmath2 model or hubbard model , have captured essential of superconductivity , and successfully explained properties of the un - doped insulator and occurrence of gap in superconductors , @xmath8 models alone can not describe and explain all observations of experiments  @xcite . despite how large the ratio between out - of - plane and in - plane resistivity is , at the phase transition temperature @xmath9 , both resistivities drop to zero simultaneously ,",
    "this indicates the phase transition is of three dimensional  @xcite , meanwhile , the observed antiferromagnetism is definitely a @xmath10 phenomenon  @xcite . some works provided evidence that superconductivity in the infinite - layer compounds @xmath11  @xcite is of three - dimensional nature which do not contain a charge - reservoir block and",
    "the distance from one unit cell to the next is the shortest among all the cuprates .",
    "experimental data  @xcite shows that the decrease of doping concentration is accompanied by a raise of anisotropy which is defined as the ratio of the correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath12 plane in cuprates superconductivity . for materials @xmath13 , @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite , coherence length and the anisotropy ratio imply that they are anisotropic @xmath10 superconductors , these phenomena are supported by good @xmath10 scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "recently observed  @xcite superconductivity in iron - arsenic - based compounds has attracted many attention .",
    "our motivation of investigating three dimensional isotropic superconductivity come directly from the measurements of the electrical resistivity in single crystals of @xmath0 in a magnetic field up to @xmath16  @xcite , yuan _ et al _ found that the superconducting properties are in fact quite isotropic , appear more three dimensional than that of the copper oxides .",
    "their results indicates that reduced dimensionality in these compounds is not necessarily a prerequisite for high temperature superconductivity .",
    "@xmath10 anisotropic @xmath1-@xmath2 model has already been studied before  @xcite . by using mean - field hamiltonian and carrying out expansion of free - energy ,",
    "two main results were obtained  @xcite : one is that transition temperature decreases weakly with both increasing of @xmath10 coupling strength and doping concentration , the other one is that in all cases @xmath5-wave pairing ansatz has the lowest energy .",
    "however , in simple cubic lattice ( scl ) , each site has six nearest neighbors(nn ) settled in three perpendicular directions , no direction is special , if superconducting behavior is possible , its symmetry can not be conventional @xmath5-wave .    with the help of renormalized mean - field theory@xcite(rmft )",
    ", we found that for isotropic case , pairing parameters on the three perpendicular directions have @xmath4 phase shift to each other . while as interaction in @xmath3 direction is suppressed , corresponding amplitude of pairing parameter drops quickly from infinite value to zero . by tuning coupling integral in @xmath3 direction",
    ", our calculation shows that superconducting symmetry are functions of the anisotropic parameter and doping concentration .",
    "moreover , as the anisotropic parameter decreases from @xmath17 to @xmath6 , symmetry of pairing parameters change from @xmath4 of @xmath10 to @xmath5-wave of @xmath18 .",
    "this may give some understanding of @xmath10-@xmath18 crossover .",
