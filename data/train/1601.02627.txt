    "<S> a boson sampling device could efficiently sample from the output probability distribution of noninteracting bosons undergoing many - body interference . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is not only classically intractable , but its solution is also believed to be classically unverifiable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a major difficulty in experiment is to ensure a boson sampling device performs correctly . </S>",
    "<S> we present an experimental friendly scheme to extract useful and robust information from the quantum boson samplers based on coarse - grained measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure can be applied to certify the equivalence of boson sampling devices while ruling out alternative fraudulent devices . </S>",
    "<S> we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and consider the effects of realistic noise . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is expected to be generally applicable to other many - body certification tasks beyond the boson sampling problem .    in the last three decades </S>",
    "<S> , quantum computation has stimulated considerable excitement among physicists , computer scientists , and mathematicians , with the general belief that quantum computers could solve certain tasks significantly faster than current electronic computers @xcite . especially after the discovery of shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , theorists and experimentalists have been teaming up to converge on the goal of demonstrating quantum supremacy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , an important step made by aaronson and arkhipov @xcite is to formulate the boson sampling problem , which is intractable for classical computers but remarkably amenable to quantum experiments . a number of elegant experiments have since implemented the problem with linear optics on a small scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pushing the experiments beyond classical capabilities would constitute a strong demonstration of the quantum speedup and in addition lead to important implications in the foundations of computer science @xcite .    at the core of the hardness - of - simulation property </S>",
    "<S> lie the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent @xcite and the exponential number of possible output events in boson sampling . </S>",
    "<S> these pose major difficulties in certifying the correctness of a boson sampler on a large scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the credibility of a certification process thus relies on gathering convincing circumstantial evidence while ruling out alternative explanations . </S>",
    "<S> several efficient schemes have been proposed to validate a boson sampler against the uniform sampler @xcite making use of the information in the unitary process @xcite and against the classical sampler of distinguishable particles @xcite exploiting the bosonic clouding behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to depart from the computationally hard space and design an efficient test based on predictable forbidden events with special inputs and scattering process @xcite , assuming the device would be equally operational in general . </S>",
    "<S> an unsettled problem especially pertinent to experiments is whether one would be able to extract useful and robust information from a large - scale boson sampler . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , would any filtered information be able to verify the equivalence of two identical boson sampling devices while excluding possible fraudulent ones ? </S>",
    "<S> in light of rapid experimental advances , this issue will be increasingly relevant when the system scales up : as the probabilities of generic output events become exponentially small , sampling noise due to limited measurement trials may conceal any distinctive information .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce an experimental friendly scheme to extract useful structures from a boson sampling device based on coarse - grained measurements . using standard statistical tools </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate the experimental certification process and show that the coarse - grained information is able to provide a quantitative assessment to the degrees of matching between two alleged boson samplers . </S>",
    "<S> this is important when one needs to verify the equivalence of two quantum samples drawn from the same boson sampling device or from different devices with identical processes . </S>",
    "<S> it will also be crucial in situations wherein we can completely trust one device and need to validate another possibly fraudulent device against the reliable one . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulation in addition demonstrates our scheme could tolerate a moderate amount of experimental noise @xcite while strong noise invalidates the equivalence due to mismatched interference processes . on a broader scale , </S>",
    "<S> our method is not specific to boson sampling , but could be applicable to other generic many - body certification problems .    before proceeding to our proposed scheme , we briefly introduce the boson sampling problem and clarify why large sampling errors are involved without coarse graining . in a typical setup , there are @xmath0 indistinguishable bosons prepared in @xmath1 input modes and allowed to coherently interfere with one another in a ( random ) unitary process . </S>",
    "<S> we abstract away from interactions between particles , so the resultant many - body interference is purely due to the bosonic statistics . to compute the probability of an output event </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to calculate the permanent of the associated @xmath2 matrix @xcite , which requires an exponential cost for a generic complex matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the possible number of output events is @xmath3 , which grows exponentially with @xmath0 ( for @xmath4 ) . as the system scales up </S>",
    "<S> , the number of measurement runs will be unable to keep pace with the exponential growth . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to large sampling errors with limited sample size . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : randuorigin ] shows an example in which the sample size is less than @xmath5 of the hilbert space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> two samples drawn from the same device could be rather dissimilar ( with a low average fidelity @xmath6 , where @xmath7{p^{q}_{s1 } } } \\cdot \\sqrt{\\smash[b]{p^{q}_{s2 } } } \\big|$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> from these distributions , it is not quite possible to assess whether the samples are drawn from the same bona fide boson sampling device .     of a boson sampling device with @xmath8 particles in @xmath9 modes after a random unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( c ) shows the zoom - in distributions of two simulated experimental samples ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) with sample size @xmath12 drawn from @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical distribution is superimposed onto the simulated samples . ]    with a proper coarse - graining procedure , we show , however , that a reliable comparison between two given output samples is achievable </S>",
    "<S> . there are a few factors that a reasonable coarse - graining procedure should consider . </S>",
    "<S> first , it should be constructed from experimental samples . on a large scale , </S>",
    "<S> classical simulation is no longer feasible . </S>",
    "<S> experiments may nevertheless pick out the important output states with higher probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> second , the procedure should be scalable : not only the measured events but all possible events should be grouped into some bubbles , where the number of bubbles should not be subject to the exponential growth . </S>",
    "<S> third , the filtered information should still carry some knowledge of the full correlations in the outputs . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the essence of the many - body interference lies in the many - mode correlations : previous works @xcite have shown that few - particle observables may not capture the full bosonic features and may falsely accept some fraudulent devices . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed scheme takes the above factors into consideration , and coarse grain the states based on the @xmath14 distance measure . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 distance between two occupation - number - basis states is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the occupation number in the @xmath18th mode for the state @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> details of the coarse - graining procedure are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematics ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this scheme is not the only way to perform coarse graining . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that other procedures meeting the above considerations may also work . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show that useful and robust structures can be extracted from the samples using our method .     </S>",
    "<S> distance smaller than a cutoff radius to this bubble center ( the cutoff radius may be increased for subsequent bubbles to ensure each one has comparable sample size ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the bubble structure is established with corresponding centers after all observed states are included . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) other samples and theoretical distributions are coarse grained with the same bubble structure . ]     </S>",
    "<S> +    we simulate the experimental certification process with two different systems , one with trapped ions and one with haar - distributed random unitaries . for all simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a fixed sample size of @xmath12 , which is a reasonable detection count in experiments , but is nevertheless smaller than @xmath5 of the hilbert space dimension in study .    for trapped ions , </S>",

    "<S> the evolution time is chosen at some intermediate time ( @xmath36s ) with interesting many - body dynamics ( see supplemental material @xcite for further results in the long time limit ) . for the random unitary process </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate @xmath8 particles in @xmath9 modes , a setting comparable to the current experimental regime with linear optics @xcite and in a limit where @xmath37 to suppress collision events . </S>",
    "<S> a haar - distributed @xmath38 random unitary matrix is used , with a hilbert space dimension of @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the coarse - graining procedure outlined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematics ] , we group the sample events into different bubbles according to one set of experimental samples . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical distributions are also subject to the same bubble structure . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : distributions ] shows an example of the coarse - grained distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this extracted information is robust and reliable with small sampling errors . by visual comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that the boson sampling data @xmath10 and @xmath11 match closely with each other , but differ significantly from samples drawn from alternative distributions , such as the distinguishable ( @xmath40 ) and uniform ( @xmath41 ) samples  @xcite . here , it is also possible to compare the simulated data with the theoretical distribution @xmath13 , which will not be directly obtainable when experiments surpass classical simulation capabilities . by repeating the procedure , </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the comparisons are not sensitive to details of the coarse - graining method , such as the particular sample used to initiate the bubble structure .    to quantify the degrees of matching between coarse - grained distributions , we employ the two - sample @xmath42 test . under the null hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> wherein two samples are drawn from the same distribution , the @xmath42 statistics follow the @xmath42-distribution with degrees of freedom ( df ) equal to the number of bubbles ( @xmath43 ) minus one . if the @xmath42 statistic is large with a small associated p - value , one nominally rejects the null hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , during the certification process , one should ideally accept the null if the pair of samples come from the same boson sampling device and reject it if one is sampled from an alternative distribution . </S>",
    "<S> two types of errors can be incurred , a type i error ( false positive ) related to falsely rejecting the true null hypothesis and a type ii error ( false negative ) associated with the failure to reject a false null hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> prior to the test , one sets a significance level @xmath44 , which will be the type i error rate if both samples are from the same distribution .     </S>",
    "<S> test - statistics for the random unitary process with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 sets of samples are generated in the simulation and distributions of the @xmath42 statistics between the corresponding pairs are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve is the @xmath42-distribution with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line marks the cutoff @xmath42 value at @xmath48 @xcite . ]    in simulation , we could generate many sets of samples and repeat the certification process to better gauge the error rates . </S>",

    "<S> a @xmath42 statistic and a p - value were computed for each @xmath42 test . </S>",
    "<S> this process was repeated for @xmath49 runs , with the distributions of the @xmath42 statistics and p - values recorded . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chi2dist ] presents the distributions of @xmath42 statistics for the random unitary process with the average number of bubbles @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen clearly that the test statistics between @xmath10 and @xmath11 follow the @xmath42 distribution with @xmath50 , whereas those between @xmath10 and @xmath40 fall on the far tail of the @xmath42 distribution , therefore offering a definitive answer regarding whether the samples are from the same distribution . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , we calculate the pass rate @xmath51 at a given significance level @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if the p - value is greater than @xmath44 , the comparison passes the test . out of @xmath52 tests , the pass rates in percentage </S>",
