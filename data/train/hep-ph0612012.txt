    "more recently , m. block and f. halzen @xcite suggested the extrapolation of @xmath1 using the analyticity arguments .",
    "they wrote , as a starting point ( @xmath5 is the photon energy in the lab frame ) : @xmath6 constants @xmath7 are constrained using the precise low energy fit at @xmath8 ( given by damashek and gilman @xcite ) .",
    "authors showed also that the fit with @xmath9 ( i.e. , the @xmath10 - dependence in asymptotic ) is not good ( from a point of view of the @xmath11-analysis ) .",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section in eikonalized minijet models is calculated by the basic formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 is the factorised eikonal , in which the probability that the photon can produce the hadronic fluctuation ( @xmath14-pair ) is removed , @xmath15 is the transverse momentum of the quarks of the pair . in general",
    ", the eikonal function @xmath16 is expressed through the parton densities inside of the hadronic fluctuation of the photon and inside the nucleon target , @xmath17    it is customary to separate the number densities @xmath18 into two components : a nonperturbative ( vmd ) component ( @xmath19 ) and perturbative one .",
    "the latter corresponds to relatively high masses of the hadronic system produced by the photon .",
    "further , one can assume that , at least at not too high energies , the vmd component is dominant and perturbative component can be neglected .",
    "it means that partonic densities ( numbers of small-@xmath20 gluons ) inside vector mesons are larger than inside of the @xmath21-pair with large @xmath22 .",
    "the well - known example of such an approach is the so - called aspen model ( `` qcd - inspired eikonal model '' ) , see @xcite for a review . in this model",
    "the starting point is the eikonal @xmath23 for the case of even scattering hadronic amplitudes ( @xmath24 ) which consists of three parts :    @xmath25    corresponding to quark - quark , quark - gluon and gluon - gluon interactions . in particular , @xmath26 if @xmath27 ( gluon structure function ) , one has @xmath28 .",

    "the @xmath39-dependence can be connected with dis dynamics ( e.g. , with dglap evolution ) as well as with the existence of an additional `` hard '' pomeron . correspondingly , there are two regge - type parametrizations of the proton structure functions , which are frequently used .    in donnachie - landshoff model of two pomerons @xcite one has , in the regge limit , @xmath41 and , in the photoproduction limit , @xmath1 is finite .",

    "@xcite the main statement is that the rescattering ( absorption ) corrections in applications of the regge theory to dis at hera energies are not small .",
    "the pomeron intercept @xmath44 is not the true pomeron intercept ( i.e. , it does not correspond to the `` bare pomeron '' ) , but rather is the effective one .",
    "the relative contribution of the most important absorptive corrections depends on @xmath39 . as a result ,",
    "at large @xmath39 we see the bare pomeron ( with intercept @xmath45 ) and at @xmath46 we see the pomeron with effective intercept @xmath47 ( i.e. , in the photoproduction limit , there is no term fastly growing with the photon energy ) .",
    "one should mention also the regge - type model of @xcite , where the concept of the effective pomeron intercept is used , the value of which is weakly dependent , in the photoproduction limit , on the photon energy .",
    "real photons and virtual photons with small @xmath40 have hadronic properties .",
    "the length of hadronic fluctuations is large ( and larger than the target size ) at large energies , @xmath48 for virtual photons and @xmath49 for real photons ( @xmath50 is the invariant mass of the hadronic fluctuation ) .",
    "so , the @xmath51-scattering is the two - step process .",
    "the basic equations of the colour dipole model are very simple due to the fact that colour dipoles are eigenstates of interaction in qcd and the well known method of eigenstates @xcite can be used .",
    "the total @xmath52- cross section is expressed through the total gluon - nucleon cross section , @xmath53 here , @xmath54 ( more exactly , @xmath55 ) is the photon - dipole wave function which depends on the photon virtuality , on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath56 carried by the quark , and on the dipole size @xmath57 .",
    "these variables are `` frozen '' during interaction .",
    "the dipole cross section , @xmath58 , is assumed to be flavour - independent and depending , except of @xmath57 , on @xmath59 or @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the gluon attached to the @xmath14-loop .",
    "perturbative qcd leads to the formula @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the energy scale depending on the dipole size , @xmath63 is the gluon density",
