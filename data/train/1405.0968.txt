    "@xmath2 \\equiv \\delta(x , t,[u(x , t ) ] ) = 0 , \\ ] ]    is a well - known technique which , over the years , has allowed for a systematic investigation of many important integrable nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) such as the kdv , nonlinear schroedinger and sine - gordon equations ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) . this technique can also be used to study nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . in this case the second independent variable , say the @xmath3 of ( [ start ] ) , is replaced by the spectral parameter @xmath4 . a remarkable example in this class of nonlinear odes",
    "is represented by the painlev equations @xcite .",
    "painlev equations arise in many contexts and they can also be defined as particular reductions of some integrable pdes solvable by the inverse scattering transfom ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of regarding each painlev equation as the compatibility condition of a set of linear differential equations goes back to the work of r. fuchs @xcite . in some recent papers by suleimanov @xcite and by zabrodin and zotov @xcite-@xcite such a mechanism has been used to define the painlev equations in the so - called `` calogero form '' .",
    "the study of painlev equations as a hamiltonian system ( also known as `` calogero form '' ) has a long history ( for some relevant references see e.g. @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it is shown that for all painlev equations @xmath5 it is possible to find a transformation @xmath6 which maps the painlev equation to the newton differential equation    @xmath7    ( where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath8 ) .",
    "equation ( [ newton1 ] ) can be regarded as the equation of motion for a time - dependent hamiltonian system    @xmath9    the main result of zabrodin and zotov @xcite is the fact that equation ( [ newton1 ] ) can be regarded as the compatibility condition of a linear spectral problem ( lsp ) which turns out to be mathematically equivalent to a time - dependent schroedinger equation    @xmath10    where @xmath3 plays the role of the spectral parameter and the quantum potential @xmath11 turns out to be identical to the potential @xmath12 up to some renormalization in the parameters contained in @xmath11 . for this reason , we will refer to equation ( [ schroedinger1 ] ) as the quantization of equation ( [ classicham ] ) in the sense of the classical - quantum correspondence as introduced by suleimanov , zabrodin and zotov ( szz ) ( see @xcite @xcite ) . for",
    "this paper to be self - contained , let us explicitly recall the notion of the classical - quantum correspondence for the painlev equations piv and pv .",
    "we first consider the lsp for painlev equation piv @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14    the compatibility condition associated with the lsp ( [ lsp1 ] ) corresponds to the painlev piv equation in the calogero form @xcite @xmath15    @xmath16    moreover , from the lsp ( [ lsp1 ] ) we observe that the function @xmath17 satisfies the following non - stationary `` real '' schroedinger equation ( [ schroedinger1 ] )    @xmath18    where the potential in the schroedinger equation ( [ schroedingerpiv ] ) turns out to be the same as that of the classical equation ( [ newtonpiv ] ) up to a shift in the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "an analogous analysis can be performed for the painlev equation pv .",
    "let us introduce the following lsp    @xmath20    where the entries of @xmath21 are given by    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    where @xmath24 are free parameters .",
    "the compatibility condition reduces to the following newton equation for the painleve equation pv    @xmath25    the function @xmath26 satisfies a `` real '' schroedinger equation for the function + @xmath27    @xmath28    which corresponds to the quantization of equation ( [ newtonpv ] ) up to a redefinition of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that both the painlev piv and painlev pv equations can be regarded as time - dependent integrable deformations for the potential of a harmonic oscillator with centrifugal barrier and the poschl teller potential , respectively    @xmath31    these potentials ( [ vpiv ] ) and ( [ vpv ] ) are well - known for being `` shape - invariant '' .",
    "shape- invariant potentials were implicitly introduced by schroedinger in @xcite and then generalized by infeld and hull in @xcite as a mechanism to solve algebraically the bounded spectrum of a quantum mechanical system ( for a more recent review on the topic see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us briefly recall the definition of a shape - invariant potential as a potential whose hamiltonian operator can be factorized through two ladder operators @xmath32    @xmath33    having the following property    @xmath34    where @xmath35 are in general parameter vectors .",
    "it is straightforward to verify by direct computation that property ( [ shapeinvariant ] ) holds for the potentials ( [ vpiv ] ) and ( [ vpv ] ) , if the ladder operators take the form    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    on the basis of the above considerations the principal objective of this paper is to show that whenever the potential @xmath38 of the newton equation ( [ newton1 ] ) does not depend explicitly on time it is possible to define a lsp whose compatibility condition involves the solution of the equation ( [ newton1 ] ) and of a nonlinear differential equation which can be reduced ( under some specific assumptions ) to the gambier equation xxvii ( gxxvii ) . in particular we will show that the exact solvability of gxxvii is connected with the exact solvability of the `` quantization '' of ( [ newton1 ] ) .",
    "in fact it turns out that if the potential @xmath39 has the shape - invariant property then it is possible to provide an exact solution of gxxvii in terms of orthogonal polynomials either classical or exceptional .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the basic concepts necessary for an understanding of the quantization in the sense of the szz . in particular we will provide the master equation which allows us to connect any newton equation ( [ newton1 ] ) to its corresponding schroedinger equation ( [ schroedinger1 ] ) .",
    "particular solutions will be provided in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 for quantum schroedinger equations characterized by potentials which are shape - invariant . in section 3",
    "we will discuss in detail the classical quantum correspondence for the harmonic oscillator system with centrifugal barrier providing the exact solution of the lsp in terms of exceptional orthogonal laguerre and jacobi polynomials .",
    "section 4 contains final remarks and possible future developments .",
    "we start by considering a completely general lsp defined by two potential matrices @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath42 are given by the traceless matrices    @xmath43    we reduce the number of undetermined functions in the entries of matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 by considering the following gauge transformation    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath19 are given by    @xmath50    the lsp    @xmath51    can be rewritten as follows    @xmath52    where @xmath53 are functions to be determined .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) defines a sturm liouville problem if we replace    @xmath54    in addition , the entry @xmath55 has to satisfy another linear pde which can be defined using the second equation in the lsp ( [ eq2 ] )    @xmath56    replacing ( [ eqq3 ] ) in ( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain    @xmath57    this equation turns into the schroedinger equation ( [ schroedinger1 ] ) if we set    @xmath58    @xmath59    the final step consists in making the system ( [ eq2 ] ) a compatible system , namely to impose the zcc .",
    "@xmath60 = 0 .\\ ] ]    from the components of @xmath61 and @xmath62 we can determine the functions @xmath48 and @xmath19    @xmath63    the last condition @xmath64 can be used to fix the function @xmath65 . however , since the goal is to connect the quantum linear problem to classical mechanics we require that the function @xmath65 be dependent on time through the time - dependent variable @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "moreover we set the function @xmath66 such that it satisfies the conservation of energy for a classical system @xmath68    with this assumption @xmath64 turns into the following pde    @xmath69    where we have denoted @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "considering our purposes we can simplify the nonlinear pde ( [ mastereq ] ) with non - constant coefficients to two nonlinear odes by assuming the following ansatz on the function @xmath72    @xmath73    in particular equation ( [ mastereq ] ) turns out to be satisfied whenever the two odes    @xmath74    @xmath75    hold .",
    "the function @xmath76 can easily be determined for any potential @xmath77 by integrating the first - order elliptic ode ( [ vc ] )    @xmath78    on the other hand we have to solve a nonlinear third - order ode ( [ vq ] ) in order to obtain the function @xmath79 which produces a given quantum potential @xmath80 .",
    "if we set the free parameters @xmath81 we can reduce ( [ vq ] ) to the second order ode    @xmath82    the equation ( [ gambier27 ] ) turns out to be the gambier equation gxxvii ( @xcite ) .",
    "such an equation can be linearized to a linear 4th - order ode . however , it is possible to express ( [ vq ] ) through a system of two sturm - liouville problems for the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84    @xmath85    which is equivalent to the 4th order ode    @xmath86    the parameter @xmath87 can be introduced with the shift @xmath88 and @xmath89 is a constant of integration .    in particular if we assume that the solution for @xmath83 in ( [ sch2 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath90 with prepotential @xmath91 , then the quantum potential @xmath92 can be expressed as @xmath93 . under these assumptions",
    "we can recast the sturm liouville problem involving @xmath84 as a schroedinger equation by introducing the following gauge transformation @xmath94",
    "@xmath95    the solution of ( [ vq ] ) reduces to the solution of a couple of schroedinger equations ( [ sch2 ] ) involving @xmath92 as a potential . in order to provide some explicit example ,",
    "let us consider the potential @xmath92 characterized by the shape - invariant property .",
    "@xmath96    such that    @xmath97    the system ( [ sch2 ] ) turns into the schroedinger equations    @xmath98    it is straightforward to verify that , given a basis of eigenfunctions for the operator @xmath99 , we obtain    @xmath100    where @xmath101 depends on the eigenvalue @xmath4 of the eq ( [ eq59 ] ) .",
    "now we present some examples in order to illustrate the above theoretical considerations .      as a simple example we consider the harmonic oscillator potential    @xmath102    such a quantum potential @xmath92 can be obtained by setting the prepotential @xmath103 as follows    @xmath104    where @xmath105 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "the potential @xmath92 in ( [ oscillatore ] ) does nt depend on the sign of @xmath106 .",
    "we assume from now on that @xmath106 is a positive real number in order to avoid singularites in the schroedinger equations ( [ susy ] ) . under these assumptions",
    "it is easy to determine the function @xmath107 from the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator    @xmath108    which satisfy the equation    @xmath109    from equation ( [ eq66 ] ) we obtain that @xmath110 satisfies    @xmath111    and the quantum potential @xmath92 turns out to be    @xmath112    also , the function @xmath84 takes the form    @xmath113    @xmath114    where @xmath115 are the exceptional laguerre orthogonal polynomials .",
    "exceptional orthogonal polynomials have been introduced quite recently by gomez - ullate et al . in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of these new orthogonal polynomials led to new families of shape - invariant potentials ( see e.g. the papers of quesne @xcite and sasaki @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting example is provided by the solution of the ode ( [ vq ] ) when the potential @xmath92 is given by the poschl - teller    @xmath116    in this case the prepotential @xmath103 takes the form    @xmath117    where @xmath118 are the jacobi polynomials .",
    "we introduce the following set of eigenfunctions for the hamiltonian operator defined by @xmath119    @xmath120    which satisfies the following equation    @xmath121    from ( [ eq73 ] ) we obtain the wavefunction in the form @xmath122 which satisfies    @xmath123    and the potential @xmath92 turns out to be    @xmath124    as previously noted the function @xmath84 turns out to be @xmath125 . in this case the function @xmath126 given by ( [ eq52 ] ) , can be expressed in terms of exceptional orthogonal polynomials    @xmath127    where the @xmath128 are the exceptional jacobi orthogonal polynomials @xcite    @xmath129    @xmath130 @xmath131    @xmath132      finally , we consider the case of the hydrogen atom .",
    "let us consider as prepotential the following    @xmath133    where @xmath134 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "we replace this prepotential @xmath103 in equations ( [ susyzero ] ) and ( [ susy ] )    @xmath135    such that equation ( [ prepoteq ] ) takes the form @xmath136",
    "@xmath137    where the wavefunction @xmath107 and the parameter @xmath101 are given by    @xmath138    in particular if we set @xmath139 we obtain an explicit form for the function @xmath84    @xmath140    from which we get for the classical potential @xmath77    @xmath141    as already shown for the quantization of ( [ schroedingerpiv ] ) , ( [ vpiv ] ) and ( [ schroedingerpv ] ) , ( [ vpv ] ) we verify that if we chose @xmath142 ( which is the choice adopted in @xcite in order to have @xmath143 ) then we obtain a classic potential @xmath144 whose limit for large @xmath145 coincides with @xmath146 .",
    "however , we should remark that in this case the energy of the system turns out to be fixed and corresponds to that of a particle moving in a kepler / coulomb potential on a circular orbit .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that any one - dimensional newton equation ( [ newton1 ] ) can be associated with a lsp which coincides with a time - dependent schroedinger equation . the aim of this section is to discuss thoroughly an explicit example with the goal of providing the exact solution of the lsp ( which in general is a superposition of solutions for the time - independent schroedinger equation ) for any given solution of its classical counterpart ( [ newtonharmonic ] ) .",
    "let us consider the harmonic oscillator potential obtained from the solution of ( [ vc ] ) with @xmath147 and the constant @xmath148 .",
    "this choice produces the following lax pair ( [ start ] ) with potential matrices of the form    @xmath149    @xmath150    it is possible to verify by direct calculation that the zcc is equivalent to the newton equation ( [ newton1 ] ) for a classical particle moving under the oscillator potential plus a centrifugal barrier    @xmath151 = 0 \\equiv \\ddot{u } - \\frac{l^2}{u(t)^3 } + \\omega^2 u(t )   = 0,\\ ] ]    which is satisfied for the function    @xmath152    the lsp ( [ eq9lsp ] ) for the lax pair ( [ uharmonic ] ) and ( [ vharmonic ] ) reduces to the following system of two linear pdes    @xmath153    where the functions @xmath26 and @xmath154 are the two component of the wave function vector    @xmath155    let us expand the function @xmath26",
    "as a series of stationary solutions of the schroedinger equation ( [ lspharmonic0 ] )    @xmath156    replacing ( [ seriessolution ] ) in ( [ lspharmonic ] ) and taking into account the following relations    @xmath157    we arrive at the following set of equations determining the coefficients @xmath158 of the series ( [ seriessolution ] )    @xmath159    @xmath160    this system of equations can be solved for @xmath158 with a series of two terms if we set the classical energy @xmath161 to the value @xmath162 . with this choice",
    "we determine the coefficients @xmath158 to be    @xmath163    therefore a classical particle moving with energy @xmath164 is associated to a @xmath26 which is a superposition of two quantum states with energies @xmath165 and @xmath166    @xmath167    which produces a probability @xmath168 which oscillates with frequency @xmath106 .",
    "to conclude let us consider the case of a stationary particle of energy @xmath169 . in this case",
    "the solution for @xmath26 turns out to be    @xmath170    whose probability , as expected , turns out to be time - independent .",
    "the main result of the paper is the application of the quantization procedure in the sense of the szz @xcite @xcite to any time - independent potential .",
    "we have shown that such a quantization can be realized up to the solution of the gambier xxvii equation .",
    "in particular it is shown that explicit solutions can always be computed for any shape - invariant potential .",
    "particular examples have been analyzed for classical and exceptional orthogonal laguerre and jacobi polyomials .",
    "finally the solution of the lsp associated with the quantization of the harmonic oscillator is provided explicitly .",
    "the classical energy @xmath171 turns out to be the mean value of the energy eigenvalues of the two wavefunctions in the series ( [ seriessolution ] ) which satisfy the lsp @xmath172 establishing in this way a new connection between the classical newton equation ( [ newtonharmonic ] ) and its quantum counterpart ( [ lspharmonic ] ) .",
    "there are reasons to expect that this connection can also be found for more general quantization procedures with time - dependent potentials .",
    "an analysis of equations ( [ vc ] ) and ( [ vq ] ) for potentials similar to the one studied in sections 2 and 3 can provide us with an explicit form of the wavefunction satisfying the lsp ( [ eq2 ] ) . since the ode ( [ vq ] ) constitutes a special case for any time - independent potential , it is evident that our approach can be applied to systems which describe much more diverse types of potentials .",
    "another interesting avenue for future research could include the study of soliton surfaces based on the lsp for quantum hamiltonian systems .",
    "these surfaces are directly expressed in terms of the wavefunction @xmath173 satisfying the associated lsp ( [ start ] ) of the considered model ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) . a visual image of such surfaces reflecting the behaviour of solutions can be of interest , providing information about the properties of these surfaces , which otherwise would be hidden in some implicit mathematical expression .",
