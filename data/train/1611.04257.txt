    "the density functional theory ( dft ) for interacting quantum many - body systems rests on the famous hohenberg - kohn and kohn - sham theorems .",
    "the fundamentals are simple : for a collection of a given number and species of particles , there is a unique universal functional @xmath0 $ ] , which determines how the total energy depends on single - particle density distributions .",
    "the density distributions in turn can be represented by those of an auxiliary system of non - interacting particles in some single - particle potential @xmath3 .",
    "dft , however , tells us nothing about the form of the functional and the potential , and provides no guidance to that end . in nuclear physics ,",
    "one traditionally begins by assuming a specific form for the effective interaction and then tries to obtain the objects @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath3 within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "methods beyond mean field are also explored  @xcite . in this project",
    "we rather do the opposite .",
    "we start from what we know about the energy of the strongly interacting fermion system that is nuclear matter . as we argue below and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy per particle in dilute nuclear matter must include low - order powers of the fermi momentum @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , beginning with the kinetic energy term , @xmath6 .",
    "we then obtain a density - dependent effective interaction which reproduces the desired functional within ( at this stage ) the self - consistent mean field approach ( hartree - fock ) .    in sec .",
    "[ s : hnm ] we summarize our reasoning and findings for nuclear matter . in sec .",
    "[ s : nucl ] we obtain an auxiliary effective ineteraction for mean - field calculations and apply it to spin - saturated nuclei .",
    "prospects are listed in sec .",
    "[ s : prosp ] .",
    "the basic idea of the present approach is to consider the fermi momentum as the fundamental variable of the functional and write the functional as a power expansion in @xmath4 beginning with the kinetic energy contribution : @xmath8 + there are two lines of physical reasoning that lead to the above form .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we argued that , within a wide range of densities relevant for nuclei and neutron stars , nuclear matter is dilute with respect to the range of heavy - meson exchange .",
    "we postulated that the average effect of the pions is a modification of the coupling constants between nucleons and heavy mesons .",
    "then , we may write the energy per particle in the same form as given by an effective field theory for dilute fermion systems  @xcite , namely an expansion in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "the expansion coefficients far from the ( trully ) dilute limit presumably are related to in - medium scattering lengths , which , however , are not known . with the help of pseudodata for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) and pure neutron matter ( pnm ) we showed that the lower - order terms @xmath9 are the most relevant and robust ( their values change weakly as we change the details of the fits ; they acquire similar values if we determine them from the saturation point ; they give better fits ) .",
    "logarithmic terms owing to three - nucleon forces were found irrelevant .",
    "our first set of parameters predicts correctly results from chiral eft and produces a neutron star mass - radius relation consistent with observations  @xcite .",
    "the second argument comes from the brueckner theory for strongly interacting fermi systems .",
    "when a  realistic \" potential is assumed between nucleons , namely one characterized by a short - range repulsive core and a medium - range attractive part , @xmath10 is precisely the sum of @xmath4 powers written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pow ] ) , as an inspection of the expressions given in @xcite shows .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , we determine @xmath11 for snm ( asymmetry @xmath12 ) and pnm ( @xmath13 ) , using @xmath14 , from fits to pseudodata  @xcite . at present",
    "we assume for simplicity that the sloppiest parameter in snm , namely @xmath15 , vanishes .",
    "we do obtain @xmath16 for a given cost function ( @xmath17 , cf .",
    "then we only have three parameters for snm , which we determine such that the saturation density of snm is @xmath18  @xmath19 , the energy at saturation is @xmath20  mev , and the incompressibility is @xmath21  mev .",
    "we get @xmath22  @xmath23mev , @xmath24  @xmath25mev , and @xmath26  @xmath27mev , close to the fitted values in ref .  @xcite . for pnm",
    "we use the fit obtained with @xmath17 , which provides @xmath28=0 .",
    "we observe that our functional can be obtained within the hartree - fock approximation ( self - consistent mean field ) from a skyrme - like effective interaction with three density - dependent terms , ( @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 , where the newly defined @xmath32 can be finite even if @xmath33 vanish , and the usual momentum - dependent terms with couplings @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "thus we can transform it into a skyrme - type functional and apply it to finite nuclei .",
    "as long as the spin degree of freedom is not probed , the procedure is legitimate within dft .",
    "energy per particle [ mev ] and charge radii of spin - saturated nuclei as a function of the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "full red lines : experimental values .",
    "dot - dashed lines : charge radius of @xmath36o ( in @xmath37o graph ) or @xmath38ca ( in @xmath39ca graph).,width=453,height=188 ]    the contribution of the momentum - dependent terms and of the @xmath40 term in homogeneous matter should add up to the @xmath41 terms . we thus write @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is unknown and will be determined from the properties of finite nuclei . at this exploratory stage",
    "we consider @xmath35 independent of the asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath43 parameters are straightforward to obtain from the functional form and @xmath44 , see , e.g. , @xcite , though we can not constrain @xmath45 and @xmath46 without the spin degree of freedom .",
    "at this stage we set @xmath47 .",
    "the above procedure gives : @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xmath23mev , @xmath51  @xmath25mev , @xmath52  @xmath27mev , @xmath53  @xmath54mev . using a skyrme - hartree - fock code  @xcite we calculate the energy and radius of the spin - saturated nuclei @xmath36o , @xmath37o , @xmath38ca , @xmath39ca .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "1 . for a value of @xmath55 ,",
    "corresponding to an almost bare - nucleon effective mass , all properties are well reproduced .",
    "the results provide a first  proof of principle \" for our approach .",
    "there are several paths to pursue next : the analysis of nuclear matter may be repeated with different higher - order terms , ( @xmath56 , or @xmath57 ) instead of @xmath58 .",
    "we need to determine the spin dependence ideally via pseudodata for polarized matter , and a spin - orbit term .",
    "data for finite nuclei can be used to fine - tune the parameters .",
    "we also wish to study excitations within rpa .",
