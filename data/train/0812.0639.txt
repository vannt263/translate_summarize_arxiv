    "the classical schubert calculus is concerned with the algebraic structure of the cohomology ring of the grassmannian @xmath3 of @xmath4-dimensional subspaces of complex affine @xmath5-space .",
    "the cohomology has a free @xmath6-basis of schubert classes @xmath7 , induced by the natural decomposition of @xmath3 into a disjoint union of schubert cells . on the other hand ,",
    "the ring is generated by the chern classes of the universal quotient bundle @xmath8 over @xmath3 , also known as the _ special _",
    "schubert classes .",
    "the theorems of pieri @xcite and giambelli @xcite are fundamental building blocks of the subject : the former is a rule for a product of a general schubert class @xmath7 with a special one , while the latter is a formula equating @xmath7 with a polynomial in the special classes .",
    "when one expresses the chern classes involved in terms of the chern roots of @xmath8 , the schubert classes are replaced by schur @xmath9-polynomials , thus exhibiting a link between the schubert calculus and the ring of symmetric functions .    in a series of papers with buch and kresch @xcite",
    ", we obtained corresponding results for the grassmannians parametrizing ( non - maximal ) isotropic subspaces of a vector space equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric or skew - symmetric bilinear form .",
    "our solution of the giambelli problem for isotropic grassmannians uses the _ raising operators _ of young @xcite in an essential way ; the resulting formula interpolates naturally between a jacobi - trudi determinant and a schur pfaffian . a rather different context in which a giambelli type formula appears that has this interpolation property is the theory of hall - littlewood symmetric functions @xcite",
    "; these objects also satisfy a pieri rule @xcite .",
    "the raising operator approach allows one to see _ directly _ that the pieri and giambelli results are formally _ equivalent _ to each other in all the above instances .",
    "this amounts to showing that _ the giambelli polynomials satisfy the pieri rule _",
    ", for the converse implication then follows easily . as a consequence , working either in the context of schubert calculus or the theory of symmetric functions , it suffices to prove either of the two theorems to establish them both . in geometry ,",
    "the pieri rule may be proved concisely by studying a triple intersection of the appropriate schubert cells , following hodge @xcite ; this is the method used in @xcite .",
    "when working algebraically , it is convenient to use the giambelli formula as the starting point , and this is the point of view of the present article .",
    "one advantage of the raising operator definition is that it makes clear that the basic giambelli polynomials , which are indexed by partitions @xmath10 , make sense when the index is any finite sequence of integers , positive or negative .",
    "when the index is a partition , it is the axis of reflection for a pair of _ mirror identities _ , both closely connected to the pieri rule .",
    "the simplest example is in the case of schur @xmath9-functions : @xmath11 where the sums are over compositions @xmath12 of length at most @xmath13 and partitions @xmath14 obtained from @xmath10 by adding ( respectively subtracting ) a horizontal strip . in  [ recsec ]",
    "we use raising operators and the mirror identities to obtain top row recursion formulas for schubert classes on isotropic grassmannians .",
    "our central thesis up to this point is that the aforementioned results may be proved without recourse to their realizations in terms of symmetric functions .",
    "the main application of the mirror identities , however , lies in the latter theory , where they can be used to obtain _ reduction formulas _ for the number of variables @xmath15 which appear in the argument of a symmetric polynomial .",
    "these in turn lead directly to _ tableau formulas _ for the polynomials in question .",
    "the tableau formulas suggest the introduction of new symmetric functions indexed by _ skew young diagrams _ , and one can then study their properties . in this way , many important aspects of the classical theory of symmetric functions , as presented in the first three chapters of @xcite , may be established by entirely different methods .",
    "moreover , the intention is to apply these techniques in a hitherto unexplored situation .",
    "our main result is a tableau formula for the theta polynomials of @xcite , which are the billey - haiman schubert polynomials @xcite for grassmannian elements of the hyperoctahedral group @xmath16 ( the union of the weyl groups for the root systems of type @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) .",
    "the theorem states that for any @xmath1-strict partition @xmath10 , we have @xmath19 where the sum is over all @xmath1-bitableaux @xmath20 of shape @xmath10 ( see  [ tableaux ] for the precise definitions ) .",
    "it bears emphasis that our proof of ( [ tabeq ] ) does not use inner products , tableau correspondences , or algorithms such as jeu de taquin and the like .",
    "we show that formula ( [ tabeq ] ) ( and its counterpart in the theory of schur and hall - littlewood functions ) follows essentially from the definition of @xmath21 using raising operators , once the pieri rule is established .",
    "the result is surprising because the pieri rule for the product @xmath22 involves partitions @xmath14 which do not contain the diagram of @xmath10 .",
    "we are led to introduce symmetric functions @xmath23 , defined for any pair @xmath24 of @xmath1-strict partitions by the equation @xmath25 where the sum is over all @xmath1-tableaux @xmath26 of skew shape @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath27 , the @xmath28 coincide with the usual skew schur @xmath29-functions @xmath30 . for general @xmath1",
    ", we prove that @xmath28 either vanishes or is equal to a certain type c stanley symmetric function @xmath31 , and therefore is always a nonnegative integer linear combination of schur @xmath29-functions .",
    "the function @xmath31 is indexed by an element @xmath0 of the hyperoctahedral group which we call _ skew_.",
    "we argue that the skew elements of @xmath16 are directly analogous to the 321-avoiding permutations @xcite in the symmetric group .",
    "for example , we show that the reduced words for @xmath0 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the standard @xmath1-tableaux of shape @xmath2 .",
    "we begin this article in  [ typea ] by giving a short proof using raising operators of the equivalence between the classical giambelli formula and the pieri rule .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the analogous result for the algebra of hall - littlewood functions in  [ hl ] , and then the more sophisticated arguments of @xcite in  [ typec : general ] .",
    "the raising operators @xmath32 which appear in the giambelli formulas of isotropic schubert calculus depend on the partition @xmath33 ; this leads to a more challenging and dynamic theory . in  [ mirrorsec ]",
    "we obtain the mirror identities for hall - littlewood functions and isotropic grassmannian schubert classes , and give some first applications .",
    "section [ red&tab ] contains our treatment of the various tableau formulas . in  [ tabhl ]",
    "we stop short of proving the ( known ) tableau formula for skew hall - littlewood functions , since the more difficult case of theta polynomials and the skew functions @xmath23 is handled in detail in  [ theta1 ]   [ theta4 ] .",
    "finally , in  [ sss ] we define the skew elements of the hyperoctahedral group and relate the results of  [ red&tab ] to the billey - haiman schubert polynomials and type c stanley symmetric functions .    for simplicity we will restrict to the type a and c theories throughout the article , and not discuss the analogous results for orthogonal grassmannians and weyl groups here .",
    "we hope that  [ typea ] and the examples of  [ pierirulegen ] provide a useful introduction to @xcite .",
    "to emphasize that the formulas in  [ typea ] -  [ mirrorsec ] do not depend on their specific realizations in the schubert calculus or the theory of symmetric functions , we have used the nonstandard notation @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for the basic polynomials , and in  [ oddsendsa ] ,  [ oddsendshl ] , and  [ oddsendscgen ] briefly discuss how these relate to other known objects .",
