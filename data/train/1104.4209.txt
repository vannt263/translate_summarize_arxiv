    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows the reference graph of a paper in the hep - th data .",
    "we can see that nodes in the graph are connected into a single component .",
    "this indicates that when authors cite one paper they also tend to cite the paper s neighbours , i.e. , papers in the paper s references or papers citing the paper .",
    "this phenomenon reflects the reading behaviour of researchers , i.e. , when they are interested in a paper they are very likely to be interested the papers in its references and papers citing it . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we can also find that the reference graph has a very high link density .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows the link density of reference graphs with respect to the out degrees of papers .",
    "it is clear that the link density of a paper s reference graph is correlated with its out - degree .",
    "this phenomenon may be attributed to the facts that papers with high out - degrees are usually reviews or surveys and thus their reference graph have lower link density while papers with low out - degrees are papers on a specific topic .",
    "furthermore , we can find such a phenomenon can not be well modeled by the existing two typical models for high clustering in citation network . in particular , the link density of the papers with high out - degrees are largely underestimated .",
    "we further find that the reference graph contains many cliques with large sizes .",
    "a clique is a subgraph within which every two nodes are connected .",
    "abundant cliques are crucial to high clustering @xcite and community structure @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the reference graph contains two cliques with size @xmath13 and the average clique size of the graph is about @xmath14 .",
    "a large clique may contain many smaller cliques . in this paper",
    ", we use the maximal clique to avoid the repetitive counting .",
    "[ fig3](b ) illustrates the distribution of the size of maximal cliques .",
    "the formation of these cliques roots in that authors always cite a group of papers which are closely related .",
    "take the literature of research on citation network as an example : in 2005 , a paper @xmath3 @xcite revealed long - term systematic features of citation statistics based the observations on a period of real data .",
    "later on , a paper @xmath2 @xcite provided a model for the aging characteristics in citation networks and cited @xmath3 as a reference .",
    "recently , wu _ et al .",
    "_ s paper @xmath0 @xcite integrated the aging and triadic closure mechanisms to model the citation patterns and cited both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which brings a 3-clique @xmath15 . as research on",
    "this problem goes on , new papers ( such as this paper ) will cite these formers and larger cliques will emerge .",
    "thus , highly connected structure , such as clique , indicates topical correlations among the nodes in it .",
    "when a paper cites one node in a clique , with a high probability it will cite others also in the clique .",
    "besides , a paper prefers to cite those with large in - degree ( popular ) and small age ( undergoing recognition ) .",
    "therefore , in a growth model in - degree and age are always taken into the preferential attachment .",
    "on the basis of above observations , we propose our model for citation networks - the _ degree_-_aging _ preferential attachment and _ clique _ neighbourhood attachment model , dac model for short .",
    "it is a growth model in which nodes join the network sequentially and attach their arcs to the old ones . in citation networks ,",
    "nodes are ordered temporally , i.e. , they joined the network according to their ages . in our dac model",
    "we keep the orders and out - degree of nodes the same as in the original data .",
    "it is innocuous to take the out - degree as given information because the out - degree of each paper is decided by its authors and most of the time we concern about the in - degree . as its name explains ,",
    "the dac model is composed of two parts ,    * _ the degree - aging preferential attachment_. a new node @xmath0 firstly originates an arc to an old node @xmath2 according to the probability @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is @xmath2 s in - degree , @xmath18 is the age of @xmath2 and @xmath19 is the decaying parameter .",
    "actually , this power - law form of probability function is widely adopted to model degree - aging preferential attachment in the literature , such as done in the dorogovtsev - mendes ( dm ) model @xcite and the model in @xcite . * _ the clique neighbourhood attachment_. with probability @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , node @xmath0 chooses to link @xmath2 s _ clique neighbours _ ,",
    "i.e. , the nodes in the same clique @xmath2 belongs to , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig1](c ) .",
    "node @xmath2 may belong to many cliques and @xmath0 randomly chooses one proportional to the clique s size and links all the nodes in the clique .",
    "otherwise , i.e. , with probability @xmath22 or when there are no clique neighbours @xmath0 can connect to , @xmath0 attaches an arc using the degree - aging preferential attachment as above . here",
    "@xmath2 is one of @xmath0 s neighbours .",
    "we repeat above attachment mechanisms to fill up the remaining out - degrees of @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , the clique neighbourhood attachment takes the connecting patterns of the potential neighbours into account and guides the formation of triangles .",
    "by tuning the parameter @xmath20 we can control the growth rate of clustering , i.e. , larger @xmath20 produces larger clustering .",
    "in this section , we examine the dac model on the following two real - world citation networks .    * ` hep - th ` data , which comes from preprints on the high - energy theory archive posted at www.arxiv.org between 1992 and 2003 .",
    "it contains @xmath23 preprints after cleaning . * ` pnas ` data , which contains @xmath24 articles published by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences ( pnas ) of the united states of america from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "we crawled the data at the journal s website ( http://www.pnas.org ) in may 2008 .",
    "we choose the two networks because they provide data with different types , i.e. , one is on a special research area and the other is on multidisciplinary sciences .",
    "the basic structural statistics of the two data are listed in table  [ tab : data_description ] .",
    "it shows that the two networks are comparable in network size while the hep - th network is much denser than pnas . since a large fraction of articles on the high - energy theory",
    "is put at www.arxiv.org , the inner citations in the hep - th data is very dense . while for pnas data , papers broadly span physical , biological and social sciences , therefore the inner citations are much lower .",
    "as we intend to model the clustering features in citation networks , three quantities are observed here : the number of triangles , the clustering coefficient and the link density of reference graph .",
    "the triangle number of the network is the basic statistic of clustering structures and its growth as a function of network size provides insights of how the clustering evolves .",
    "the average clustering coefficient for the network gives an overall indication of the clustering in the whole network .",
    "we also analyze the average clustering coefficient of vertices with the same degree as a function of the degree , because this correlation is a useful function to understand the local structure of the network . for the link density of reference graph",
    ", it is used to validate the matching of the real data and our model in selecting neighbours .",

    "<S> for the study of citation networks , a challenging problem is modeling the high clustering . </S>",
    "<S> existing studies indicate that the promising way to model the high clustering is a copying strategy , i.e. , a paper copies the references of its neighbour as its own references . </S>",
    "<S> however , the line of models highly underestimates the number of abundant triangles observed in real citation networks and thus can not well model the high clustering . in this paper , we point out that the failure of existing models lies in that they do not capture the connecting patterns among existing papers . by leveraging the knowledge indicated by such connecting patterns , we further propose a new model for the high clustering in citation networks . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on two real world citation networks , respectively from a special research area and a multidisciplinary research area , demonstrate that our model can reproduce not only the power - law degree distribution as traditional models but also the number of triangles , the high clustering coefficient and the size distribution of co - citation clusters as observed in these real networks .    </S>",
