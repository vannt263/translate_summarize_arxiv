    "a number of computational studies of sputtering in self - consistent models of perpendicular c - type hydromagnetic shocks in dusty , dark regions have been performed ( e. g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the only numerical investigation of sputtering in oblique c - type shocks in such regions is not based on self - consistent shock models ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite attempted to construct a self - consistent , four fluid model of an oblique c - type shock in which dust grains are described as a charged fluid , as they are in the perpendicular c - type shock models of @xcite .",
    "however , the integrations performed by @xcite failed to yield solutions corresponding to steady fast - mode shocks .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the failure is due to the saddle - point nature of the downstream state of a fast - mode dusty shock .",
    "@xcite developed a numerical scheme for solving the time - dependent multifluid hydromagnetic equations that enables the construction of steady fast - mode solutions even when local equilibrium does not obtain .",
    "@xcite have used the scheme along with non - equilibrium chemistry and treatments of grain charge and heating and radiative losses to investigate the evolution of oblique c - type shocks propagating into media with constant upstream properties .",
    "@xcite extended the applications to oblique c - type shocks propagating through media with varying upstream properties .",
    "here we use models like those of @xcite to study sputtering in oblique c - type shocks in dusty , dark molecular regions .",
    "section 2 contains descriptions of the assumptions , the physical processes included , the chemical network , the evaluation of the sputtering rates and upstream boundary conditions .",
    "results are presented in section 3 , and section 4 contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "the model includes neutral , ion , electron and two grain fluids .",
    "flow variables depend on only the spatial coordinate @xmath1 and time @xmath2 .",
    "the upstream magnetic field has components in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 directions , and the shock propagates in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "equations  1 - 8 of @xcite are solved with the scheme of @xcite .",
    "the inertia of the charged fluids , including the grain fluids , is neglected in this approach , so that their dynamics is solely determined by the balance between the lorentz force and collision forces with neutral particles .",
    "additionally , the grain fluids are assumed to have zero pressure .",
    "the average charge on a grain is determined by the condition that the magnitude of the current of ions onto a grain equals the magnitude of the current of electrons onto a grain ; eqs .",
    "10 and 11 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also appendix  [ sect : appa ] ) are used to calculate these currents .",
    "the numerical method of @xcite provides a rigorous means to model steady shock structures and , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , reproduces the results of , among others , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although it neglects grain inertia , the method can accurately model neutral subshock structures @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the number density , @xmath4 , of chemical species @xmath5 is governed by a rate equation of the form : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the @xmath1 component of the ion or neutral velocity depending on whether @xmath5 is an ion or a neutral .",
    "@xmath8 is the net rate of formation or destruction of species @xmath5 per unit volume per unit time due to the gas phase reactions and grain surface recombinations listed in table  [ table : rateqns ] and the return of material to the gas phase due to sputtering .",
    "though no reactions involving sio are shown in table  [ table : rateqns ] , atomic si returned to the gas phase due to sputtering is assumed to be converted to sio immediately .    o produced by gas - phase chemistry ( solid ) and mantle sputtering ( dashed ) as function of the shock speed for @xmath9 .",
    "]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      once the grain mantles are vapourised , the grain cores begin to erode as long as the impact speeds of the projectiles are high enough .",
    "as the binding energy of a particle in the grain core is higher than in the mantle , higher grain - neutral drift speeds are necessary .",
    "again co is the sputtering projectile of most importance at lower speeds , and small grains start to contribute to the sio gas - phase abundance at shock speeds of 25  km  s@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for shocks for which @xmath10 ) .",
    "this result is similar to the one of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "collisions with co dominate the sputtering at shock speeds up to 30 km s@xmath0 . above shock speeds of about 35 km",
    "s@xmath0 the highest sputtering rate per unit time per unit volume of elemental silicon is due to collisions with h@xmath11o .",
    "table [ table : coresputterfrac ] displays the fraction of the initial core elemental silicon that is sputtered .",
    "it also gives the enhancement in the downstream gas phase sio fractional abundance due to sputtering .",
    "similarly to the results for mantle sputtering , the core sputtering of the small grains is independent of @xmath12 ( as their hall parameter is much larger than unity ) .",
    "the large grains are more efficiently sputtered in the low - density regime but contribute only a negligible amount to the sio gas - phase abundance . for a range of shock speeds ,",
    "the sio production rises with increasing speed with values similar as in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "however , the sio abundance reaches an upper limit as c - type shocks do not exist for shock speeds above a certain value . for higher shock speeds , shocks are of j - type . for @xmath13",
    "the transition occurs for a shock speed between 50 and 55  km  s@xmath0 , while a j - type shock occurs for a minimum shock speed between 35 and 40  km  s@xmath0 for @xmath14 . at these speeds",
    "the grain cores are not completely destroyed , i.e. only a few percent of the core is removed in the high - density case and about a third of the core is destroyed in the low - density regime .",
    "hence , the maximum sio fractional abundance differs by an order of magnitude between the two density regimes .      up to now",
    "we have discussed the grain sputtering for an oblique shock for which @xmath15 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the shock properties , such as the shock width , change as function of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , variations , with angle , of the h@xmath11o and sio abundances due to sputtering is expected .",
    "figure [ fig : obliquemantlesputter ] presents results for 16 km s@xmath0 shocks propagating into media with n@xmath17 = 10@xmath18 @xmath19 at angles of 30@xmath20 , 45@xmath20 and 60@xmath20 with respect to the upstream magnetic field .",
    "the fraction of the ice that is sputtered from each type of grain , rather than the gas phase abundance of water , is shown because much of the gas phase water exists due to the conversion of upstream gas phase atomic oxygen to water .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : obliquemantlesputter ] indicate that the h@xmath11o abundance is lowest in the shock with the largest width .",
    "it is obvious that the shock width is irrelevant for the level of sputtering as the sputtering depends mainly on the neutral - grain drift speeds . as the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : obliquemantlesputter ] shows , the peak small and large grain - neutral drift speeds are smallest at large angles ; they are 10.5  km  s@xmath0 at 30@xmath20 , 10  km  s@xmath0 at 45@xmath20 and 9.5  km  s@xmath0 at 60@xmath20 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the results shown in fig .  2 of @xcite who found that the @xmath3 and @xmath21 components of the velocities of charged species are greater for smaller angles .",
    "furthermore , the length scale over which the drift speeds are higher than 6  km  s@xmath0 , i.e. the minimum drift speed for which mantle sputtering is efficient , are similar for all angles .",
    "the angular variations in the fraction of water that is sputtered are significant and range from 0.4 at 60@xmath22 to 0.6 at 30@xmath22 such variations disappear with increasing shock speed because for high enough speeds vaporisation of the grain mantle is complete for all angles .",
    "figure [ fig : obliquecoresputter ] presents results for 25 km s@xmath0 shocks propagating into media with n@xmath17 = 10@xmath23 @xmath19 at angles of 30@xmath20 , 45@xmath20 and 60@xmath20 with respect to the upstream medium .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : obliquecoresputter ] show that the sio abundance too is lowest in the shock with the largest width .",
    "again these differences can be attributed to the peak small grain - neutral drift speeds which are smallest at large angles ; they are 18.2 km s@xmath0 at 30@xmath20 , 18 km",
    "s@xmath0 at 45@xmath20 and 17 km s@xmath0 at 60@xmath20 .",
    "contrary to the h@xmath11o results , these modest differences in drift speeds have large effects on the amount of elemental silicon that is sputtered , i.e. there is a difference of two orders of magnitude between the sio abundance at 30@xmath22 and 60@xmath22 .",
    "however , note that the shock speed is close to the threshold speed for core sputtering",
    ". then small variations in the drift speed can mean the difference between core sputtering or no sputtering at all .",
    "for higher shock speeds the angular differences in sio abundance are less pronounced , but the trend of lower abundances for larger @xmath16 remains .",
    "in this paper we present the first self - consistent multifluid mhd simulations of grain mantle and core sputtering in oblique c - type shocks propagating through dusty media .",
    "the small grains are more tightly coupled to the magnetic field than the large grains with a strong coupling in both low- and high - density regimes .",
    "this maximises the drift speeds between the small grains and the neutral sputtering projectiles resulting in more efficient sputtering of the small grains .",
    "mantle sputtering starts at shock speeds of about 10  km  s@xmath0 , and the mantles are completely vapourised for shock speeds around 20 - 25  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the sputtering of the icy mantles returns water back to the gas phase . however , neutral - neutral chemistry dominates the production of gas phase water by an order of magnitude .    once the mantles are completely eroded , core sputtering commences and releases silicon to form sio .",
    "the abundance of sio in the gas phase never saturates as even at the critical speed for the transition from c- to j - type shocks not all of a grain core is destroyed . while the critical speed is 50 - 55  km  s@xmath0 for @xmath24 , it is only 40  km  s@xmath0 for @xmath14 . for a given shock speed",
    "the efficiency of small grain sputtering is not sensitive to the density .",
    "consequently , the density dependence of the c- to j - type transition means that higher sio abundances can be produced by shocks in the low - density regime .",
    "an important result is that the sputtering yields depend on the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal .",
    "especially , at the threshold drift speeds for mantle or core sputtering , small angular variations can induce large changes in abundances .",
    "for example , for shocks propagating at 25  km  s@xmath0 in media with number densities of 10@xmath25 , the sio abundance differs by two orders of magnitude for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this has important consequences for the interpretation of observations .",
    "for example , discrete emission features in sio observations have been ascribed to different shocks being present within the telescope beam ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , such features can be explained by a bow shock interacting with an inhomogeneity in the medium .",
    "the flanks of the bow shock have lower speeds than the head and also make different angles with the magnetic field . in an inhomogeneous medium some regions of the bow - shock",
    "are then highlighted resulting in discrete sio emission features .",
    "such an assumption , however , needs to be further examined by extending the planar shock model to multiple dimensions .",
    "direct comparisons of the results with those of other researchers is complicated as the only previous work ( @xcite ) on sputtering in oblique shocks is not based on self - consistent shock models . also , the treatment of core sputtering in that work differed from that developed by @xcite and used in subsequent work .",
    "however , the results given in table [ table : coresputterfrac ] for the fraction of elemental silicon sputtered from small grains are in harmony with the results of @xcite for a shock for which @xmath15 . other self - consistent studies concern only perpendicular shocks ( @xmath28 ) and , thus , should find similar , although lower , values for shock speed exceeding the threshold value for sputtering .",
    "@xcite , who assumed a somewhat larger upstream magnetic field strength and different grain population , found that the fraction of silicon that is sputtered is about 0.04 for n@xmath29 cm s@xmath0 and a shock speed 40 km s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite who adopt a kinetic method for the dust grain dynamics in favour of a fluid approach , find a value of 0.02 for the same model as @xcite .",
    "the corresponding result given in table [ table : coresputterfrac ] is 0.04 .",
    "the sio abundances found in our simulations only represent upper limits .",
    "observations indicate that silicate - based grains only account for about 75% of the interstellar dust mass with the rest of the mass stored in carbonaceous grains or pahs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the conversion of atomic silicon into sio is not fully efficient above densities of 10@xmath30 which possibly reduces the sio abundance due to sputtering by an order of magnitude @xcite .    unlike @xcite and @xcite , who included grains 40 times smaller than the smallest that we have assumed to be present , we have not considered the destruction of grain material due to grain - grain collisions .",
    "our choice to focus solely on sputtering first was based in part on a desire to understand the effects of obliqueness on sputtering before looking at the complicated way in which obliqueness , sputtering and grain - grain collisions all act together to destroy grains . our decision to do",
    "so was informed by the estimates of @xcite that showed for grain populations of the sizes that we selected , grain - grain collisions would contribute significantly to mantle removal only at shock speeds near the threshold even for high pre - shock densities .",
    "our choice has allowed us to see that obliqueness affects sputtering near the threshold shock speed significantly . however , considering the findings of both @xcite and of @xcite for the return of silicon to the gas phase , as well as the results given in figure [ fig : obliquecoresputter ] , we conclude that the future inclusion of both grain - grain collisions and obliqueness in shock models is necessary to infer the threshold shock speed for the injection of significant quantities of silicon into the gas phase .",

    "the authors are grateful for the support provided by a studentship and successive rolling grants awarded by the uk science and technology funding council and from the sma postdoctoral fellowship of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory held by svl .",
