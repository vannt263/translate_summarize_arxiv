    "classical information may be conveyed to a receiver through quantum channels . to this aim",
    "a transmitter prepares a quantum state drawn from a collection of known states and sends it through a given quantum channel .",
    "the receiver retrieves the information by measuring the channel , such to discriminate among the set of possible preparations , and to determine the transmitted signal .",
    "the encoding states are generally not orthogonal and also when orthogonal signals are transmitted , they usually lose orthogonality because of noisy propagation through the communication channel . therefore , in general , no measurement allows the receiver to distinguish perfectly between the signals @xcite and the need of optimizing the detection strategy unavoidably arises .    in binary communication based on optical signals , information is encoded into two quantum states of light .",
    "amplitude modulation - keyed signals ( amk ) , consist in two states of a single - mode radiation field , which are given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a given _ seed _ state , usually taken as the vacuum , @xmath5 denotes the displacement operator , and the complex amplitude @xmath6 may be taken as real without loss of generality .",
    "the reason to choose amk signals lies in the fact that displacing a state is a simple operation , which is experimentally achievable by a linear coupler and strong reference beam @xcite .",
    "another binary encoding , based on displacement , is given by phase shift - keyed signals ( psk ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the amk situation only , though all the results hold also for psk .",
    "the price to pay for such a convenient encoding stage is that , for any choice of the seed state , the two signals are always not orthogonal , and thus a nonzero probability of error appears in their discrimination @xcite .",
    "if we consider equal _ a priori _ probabilities for the two signals , the optimal quantum measurement to discriminate them with minimum error probability is the projection - valued measure @xmath9 , @xmath10 , corresponding to @xcite @xmath11 |\\lambda_k\\rangle\\langle\\lambda_k|\\ , , \\label{optpvm}\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is an eigenstate of the hermitian operator @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath14 , and @xmath15 $ ] is the unit step function , which is zero for negative @xmath16 , one for positive and @xmath17 .",
    "the probability of inferring the symbol @xmath18 when @xmath19 is transmitted is given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , such that the average error probability in binary communication is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath23 , corresponding to the optimal measurement ( [ optpvm ] ) , reads as follows @xmath24 and is known as the helstrom bound @xcite . in particular , for a pair of amk signals we have @xmath25 where with @xmath26 we denote the average number of photons in the channel _ per use _ , _ i.e. _ @xmath27 = \\frac12 |\\alpha|^2 + n_0 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the average photon number of the seed state . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will refer to @xmath26 also as to the _ energy of the channel_. notice that for a pair of psk signals the same bound in equation ( [ p : dolinar ] ) holds ; however , the expression for @xmath26 is now given by @xmath29 .",
    "binary communication has been the subject of much attention , mostly concerning the design and the implementation of optimal quantum detection processes , to distinguish nonorthogonal signals with reduced error probability , possibly approaching the helstrom bound given in equation ( [ optpe ] ) .",
    "the relevant parameter in this optimization is the energy of the channel , which itself limits the communication _ rate _ of the channel .",
    "after the pioneering work of helstrom @xcite , a near - optimum receiver for amk signals based on direct detection was proposed in @xcite , whereas an optimum receiver approaching the minimum error probability ( [ p : dolinar ] ) ( based on photon counting and feedback ) has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "more recently , various efforts has been made to find out optimum detection operators and decision processes for more general signals and in presence of noise @xcite .",
    "indeed , when one has at disposal a given set of quantum signals , the problem becomes that of finding the optimal receivers @xcite and detection schemes @xcite and to compare their performances with those of realistic detectors . following this way",
    ", some studies were made on the effects of thermal noise on the optimum detection for a coherent amk channel @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on protocols for binary communications where both amk signals and receivers can be realized with current technology . as we will see , the various sources of loss and noise can be described as an overall gaussian noise .",
    "our analysis allows to unravel the different contributions and to compare receivers in realistic working regimes .",
    "the purpose is twofold : on one hand we perform a systematic comparison between direct and homodyne detection in presence of noise during the propagation and the detection stages , in order to find in which working regimes a receiver should be preferred . on the other hand , we show that binary communication can be improved by using achievable sources of entanglement and realistic heterodyne receivers .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown that in ideal conditions ( perfect detection and noiseless propagation ) entanglement improves the performances of a binary channel , _",
    "i.e. _ it reduces the error probability in the discrimination of the symbols @xcite . motivated by these results ,",
    "we investigate the error probability of entangled channels in realistic conditions , taking into account the unavoidably noise that occurs during the propagation and the detection .",
    "since we are interested in assessing entanglement as an effective resource , we compare entangled channels with the corresponding realistic single - mode channels .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : single : mode ] we address single - mode channels that uses direct or homodyne detection as receivers , and compare the corresponding error probabilities both in ideal and realistic situations , _",
    "i.e. _ in presence of noise . in section",
    "[ sec : ent : modes ] we describe a binary communication scheme based on entangled twin - beam state of radiation that employs multiport homodyne or heterodyne detection in the measurements stage .",
    "as we will see , there are regimes where the error probability is less than in a single mode channel , also when the noise affects propagation and detection .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we summarize our results giving some concluding remarks .",
    "a scheme based on direct detection , to discriminate the set @xmath30 or @xmath31 , is mixed with a given coherent reference state , say @xmath32 .",
    "the outgoing mode is subsequently revealed by on / off photodetection , _",
    "i.e. _ by a detector which checks the presence or absence or any number of photons",

    "if the input state is @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being coherent states , the output state is given by @xmath42 . by choosing the amplitude of the reference as @xmath43 , we obtain , at the output , the vacuum when the input state is @xmath31 , and @xmath44 for vacuum input , in formula @xmath45 in order to discriminate the two input signals , one performs a simple on / off photodetection : when the output is the vacuum the detector does nt click , otherwise it clicks .",
