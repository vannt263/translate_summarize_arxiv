    "the thermodynamic stability of dense ionic mixtures bears important consequences not only on our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of dense binary systems but also on the structure and the evolution of gaseous giant planets .",
    "indeed , the interior of jovian planets is composed essentially of hydrogen and helium under either atomic or molecular form in the outermost envelope and under the form of a partially or fully ionized plasma in the inner regions @xcite @xcite . temperatures and pressures along the jupiter or",
    "saturn internal isentrope conditions range from about 100 k to @xmath2 20000 k and from about 1 bar to @xmath3 mbar . under these conditions , not only the hydrogen / helium mixture experiences pressure ionization but the homogeneous mixture may become thermodynamically unstable .",
    "such an immiscibility between helium - rich droplets and a hydrogen - rich fluid will liberate extra gravitational energy , modifying significantly the energy balance and thus the cooling of the planet @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite . for terrestrial applications , inertial confinement fusion experiments or laser - driven shock - wave experiments on hydrogen isotopes reach densities and temperatures characteristic of the aforementioned planetary conditions , probing the thermodynamic properties of dense plasmas and requiring a correct theoretical foundation to describe their equilibrium properties .",
    "the theoretical description of the thermodynamic phase diagram of a dense two - component system is a particularly complicated task , for it requires a correct description of the _ excess _ free enthalpy ( in a pressure - temperature diagram ) of the mixture with respect to the pure phases .",
    "this excess quantity is very small compared with the contributions of both the mixture and the pure phases ( it is by definition close to zero near the critical point ) and therefore must be calculated with very high accuracy .",
    "early calculations , based on simplified analytic or semi - analytic calculations of the free energy of the plasma , assumed hydrogen and helium atoms to be fully ionized @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . moreover , these calculations assumed either a rigid electron background , the so - called binary ionic mixture ( bim ) model , or a polarizable electron background within the linear response approximation .",
    "although correct at very high density or temperature , these assumptions fail when electrons and protons start to recombine .",
    "the phase diagrams calculated under these conditions are thus restricted to a reduced ( high ) density - temperature range .",
    "further attempts to do a consistent , first - principle determination of the h / he phase diagram , with no assumption on the electron distribution around the ionic centers and a correct treatment of the various @xmath4-body ion and electron interactions , were based either on extrapolation at finite - temperature of zero - temperature calculations @xcite or on incorrect thermodynamics integration @xcite and thus remain also of doubtful validity . under such circumstances , it is clear that not only the thermodynamic phase diagram of a hydrogen - helium system at high density has not been established accurately yet , but the correct calculation of the excess free enthalpy of a concentration of atoms immersed in an interacting system of different species remains to be done .    in this paper , we derive a new method to address this very point , which is crucial for a reliable determination of the thermodynamic phase diagram of dense binary mixtures .",
    "this method is applied in the microcanonical ensemble and allows the direct calculation , from first principles , of the excess chemical potential of a binary mixture of nuclei and electrons interacting through the coulomb potential .",
    "calculations in the microcanonical ensemble allow a fully consistent calculation between the forces acting on the particles and the induced trajectories , without the introduction of thermostats .",
    "we first derive the thermodynamic equations which allow the exact determination of the excess chemical potential .",
    "we then combine the density functional theory ( dft ) to describe the quantum mechanical properties of the electrons and molecular dynamics ( md ) to integrate the ion classical equations of motion to calculate this chemical potential .",
    "since the present paper is devoted to the derivation of the method , we use a simplified functional form for the electrons , namely the thomas - fermi approximation , in order to speed up the minimization of the energy .",
    "we limit our calculations to three different values of the appropriate input thermodynamic quantities , namely energy and density in the microcanonical formulation used in the present paper . in a future work , devoted to the global analysis of the h / he mixture under various thermodynamic conditions ,",
    "a more general functional form will be implemented .",
    "section 2 presents the derivation of the chemical potential of @xmath0 atoms of a given species interacting with @xmath1 nuclei of a different species .",
    "section 3 describes our general energy functional to take into account the quantum behaviour of the electrons when computing the ionic configurations , a necessary condition for an accurate treatment of the problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the description of the md numerical computations , to the discussion of the finite size effects and to the presentation of the results obtained for different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the ultimate goal of our calculations is to determine the thermodynamic stability of a given number @xmath0 of atoms immersed in a system of @xmath1 particles of a different species under given thermodynamic conditions , without any assumption on the electron distribution around the nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ on the degree of ionization of the atoms .",
    "the stability of such a mixture involves the calculation of the mixing enthalpy of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ of the excess chemical potential of each immersed atom .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath5 of a particle @xmath6 immersed in a plasma corresponds by definition to the change of the state function of the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble when one adds or removes this particle to / from the plasma .",
    "when the thermodynamic limit is achieved @xmath7 , @xmath8constant@xmath9 , the result does not depend either on the ensemble or on the fact that the particle has been added to or removed from the surrounding plasma .",
    "because of the large fluctuations of the system away from its equilibrium configuration , one can not add or remove directly a particle , in particular at high density or if the interaction potential is too stiff .",
    "the correct approach consists in modifying progressively the interaction potential @xmath10 between the particle @xmath6 and the surrounding particles @xmath11 .",
    "the case @xmath12 corresponds to the case where the particle @xmath6 does not interact with the other particles , but retains its discernability character ( case of an ideal mixture ) , whereas the case @xmath13 corresponds to the sought two - component system with full interactions .",
    "this method illustrates the so - called thermodynamic integration approach . in the microcanonical ensemble , with fixed energy , volume and number of particles @xmath14 , the chemical potential of a particle  1 \" of mass @xmath15 corresponds to the calculation of the following expression derived in appendix a - c :    @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "the brackets @xmath21 denote a microcanonical average .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the ideal part of the chemical potential , arising from the entropy cost due to the particle insertion or removal , while the second term represents the non - ideal contribution of the chemical potential , which depends on the interaction between the particle under consideration and the rest of the system .",
    "the integral can be estimated by a gauss - legendre quadrature @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are the zeros of legendre polynomials and @xmath24 are the associated weights @xcite .    these calculations , in practice , require great caution . by definition of the microcanonical ensemble , the total ( potential+kinetic ) energy of the system must be conserved along the simulation . as a consequence , at each step where the potential goes from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , the kinetic part of the energy",
    "must be renormalized in order to maintain the total energy constant . therefore",
    ", the correct calculation of the chemical potential consists in generating several particle configurations ( to be described in  4 ) corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath27 , and in computing the averages which appear in eq.([eq_chem_pot ] ) .",
    "this can be done by a fully classical simulation if the interaction between each kind of particles is described by a classical 2-body potential between particles .",
    "such an approach , however , can not take into account the fact that the potentials strongly depend on the density and the temperature , evolving from a potential characteristic of atoms at low density and temperature to a long - range coulomb potential characteristic of a fully ionized plasma at high density and/or temperature .",
    "therefore , the correct phase diagram , without any assumption on the interaction potentials , requires _",
    "ab initio _ generations of representative ionic configurations .",
    "this approach is presented in the next sections .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a correct study of the problem under consideration requires a correct treatment of the ion and electron interactions .",
    "this implies to take into account the effects of the quantum nature of the electrons on the forces acting on the ions . since the pioneering work of hohenberg and kohn @xcite ,",
    "many problems involving interacting electrons have been tackled within the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this theory turns the diagonalization problem of a many - body hamiltonian into the minimization of a functional @xmath28 $ ] of the electron density , a much easier approach when dealing with many electrons . for this reason ,",
    "the dft has been extensively used in condensed matter and is described in detail in many textbooks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the framework of the dft , the grand potential of the electrons can be written in the form :    @xmath29=\\int { \\mathrm{d } } { \\bm r}\\ , ( v_{\\mathrm{ie}}({\\bm r})-\\mu ) \\ , n({\\bm r } ) + f[n({\\bm r } ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 $ ] is a universal functional of the ground state density @xmath31 of the interacting electrons and @xmath32 denotes the external ion - electron potential .",

    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are the fermi integrals , where @xmath40 is obtained by the inversion of the relation : @xmath41 .",
    "accurate fitting formulae of the fermi integrals and inverse integrals have been published in the literature @xcite @xcite . for a given configuration of the nuclei , we are able to find the electronic density @xmath31 which corresponds to the ground state of the system .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite @xcite enables us to calculate the forces arising from this electron density acting on the nuclei and the stress tensor on a cell ( of which diagonal terms correspond to the pressure components ) .",
    "+ within the born - oppenheimer approximation , we can thus make a classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of the nuclei sub - system , while taking into account in the calculation of the forces the quantum behaviour of the electrons .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation expresses the fact that the electrons respond instantaneously to a change of configuration of the ions , a fairly good assumption for dense ionic systems .",
    "the calculation of the last term on the right hand side of eq.([eq_tffunc ] ) , _ i.e. _ the interaction with the external ionic potential , involving effective pseudopotentials , is described below .",
    "we have computed eq.([eq_chem_pot ] ) for a number of @xmath0 helium atoms of nuclear charge @xmath42 and mass @xmath43 immersed in a system of @xmath1 hydrogen particles of charge @xmath44 and mass @xmath45 .",
    "the thermodynamic averages in eq.([eq_chem_pot ] ) are estimated by generating a set of representative configurations of the system in a cubic reference cell of size @xmath46 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is done by a dynamical simulation of the equations of motion for the ions :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the mass of the @xmath6th nuclei .",
    "the forces @xmath49 between particles ( or equivalently the total potential @xmath50 ) arising from electron and ion @xmath4-body interactions , beyond any linear approximation for the electron - induced screening effects of the core potential , are calculated from a density functional approach .",
    "these forces involve the ones arising from the quantum electron distribution obtained from eq.([eq_tffunc ] ) and the ones derived from the interionic potential @xmath51 .",
    "the equations of motion are solved with a standard verlet velocity algorithm @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of the present paper is that these calculations are completed in the microcanonical ensemble , _",
    "i.e. _ at constant energy , volume and total momentum @xcite .",
    "standard simulations , in other thermodynamic ensembles , imply the introduction of a thermostat , either by reinitializing the velocities `` periodically '' or by introducing new degrees of freedom .",
    "these thermostats , however , yield a perturbation of the trajectories , which no longer represent the ones determined by the forces .",
    "such unphysical effects are avoided in the present microcanonical calculations , which insure full consistency between the forces and the trajectories .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations , with the aforedescribed functional , have been performed with the abinit code @xcite .",
    "we replace the bare coulomb potential of the nucleus by a pseudopotential , which differs from the true coulomb potential below a cutoff radius @xmath52 , removing the cusp constraint at @xmath53 and avoiding the @xmath54 singularity .",
    "the pseudopotentials used in our simulations are those of hartwigsen _ et al .",
    "_ for helium @xcite , and goedecker _ et al . _ for hydrogen @xcite .",
    "these pseudopotentials are constructed so as to reproduce with high accuracy the kohn - sham free energy .",
    "the aforementioned cutoff radius determines an upper bound in density for the domain of validity of the pseudopotentials .",
    "the ones used in the present calculations  @xcite have @xmath55 bohr , which implies a density limit : @xmath56 , _ i.e. _ @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the density parameter , @xmath59 is the mean distance between nuclei and @xmath60 is the bohr radius .",
    "this condition corresponds to @xmath61 .    as mentioned earlier , in order to maintain the total energy constant during the process of switching on or off the interaction , the kinetic contribution @xmath62 must be renormalized . for the thermodynamic conditions of our runs",
    ", this corresponds to a decrease of @xmath62 because the potential energy increases as the interaction is switched on ( @xmath63 . this implies a large initial kinetic energy .",
    "the condition is more easily fulfilled if one chooses to switch _ off _ the interaction instead of switching it on ( @xmath64 . indeed , during such a process , the kinetic part must be increased ( instead of decreased ) , which is always possible . as a consequence of this renormalization , we can not associate an accurate temperature until the thermodynamic limit is reached .",
    "this process is represented on figure [ fig_ekin ] , which displays the kinetic energy during the whole process , and shows the discontinuities appearing in the mean value of @xmath62 when @xmath65 changes from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "we have tested our procedure on a system consisting of 63 hydrogen nuclei and 1 helium nucleus .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions of our microcanonical simulation are : @xmath68 hartree and @xmath69 bohr@xmath70 , which correspond to @xmath71 , @xmath72 k and @xmath73 gpa .",
    "the reference cell of the simulation assumes periodic boundary conditions , with one particle exiting the cell on one side replaced by one entering the opposite side . in order for the final results not to depend on the initial distribution , which corresponds to a random distribution of the positions and velocities ( obtained by a classical molecular dynamics simulation to prevent atoms to overlap ) , we let the system relax during 4000 time steps , a very conservative limit for the considered densities and temperatures .",
    "even though the main contribution to the total energy at @xmath74 comes from the nearly uniform electron background , the forces depend partly on the non - uniformity of this electron density distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the forces correctly , the electronic density , more precisely the departure of the density from a homogeneous distribution , must be calculated with very high accuracy . in order to fulfil this condition",
    ", we require the energy to converge within @xmath75 .",
    "unfortunately , high accuracy in the functional minimization does not preclude energy fluctuations during the simulation due to the discretization of the newton equations and , most importantly , to finite - size effects .",
    "these points are examined below .",
    "the equations of motion are solved using the verlet algorithm with a time step equal to @xmath76 a.u .",
    "this time step enables us to resolve the dynamics of our system accurately for any value @xmath77 of the he - h interaction .",
    "figure [ fig_e22 ] displays the conservation of the total energy obtained in our simulation with this time step .",
    "the integral eq.([eq_chem_pot_quad ] ) is first calculated with a @xmath78-point gauss - legendre quadrature .",
    "after the first 4000 time steps to let the system relax , an other 4000 time steps simulation is ran to generate several configurations .",
    "the argument @xmath79 is calculated numerically , by calculating @xmath80 every 10 time steps for a fixed configuration and @xmath81 .",
    "a last run is devoted to the calculations of the ideal part of the chemical potential by generating 10000 different configurations of 63 h and the evaluation of @xmath82 .",
    "we have tested the validity of the @xmath78-point quadrature to estimate the integral eq.([eq_chem_pot_quad ] ) by doing similar calculations , for the same thermodynamic conditions , with a 3-point , 6-point and a 9-point quadrature .",
    "the results are shown on figure [ fig_quadra ] , and the resulting evaluations of the integral are given in table [ tab - gauss ] .",
    "as seen in this table , a 6-point quadrature is enough to calculate accurately the integral ( [ eq_chem_pot_quad ] ) .",
    "our calculations of the chemical potential @xmath83 of a helium atom embedded in a 63-h plasma for our thermodynamic conditions ( @xmath84 corresponds to the ideal part of the chemical potential and @xmath85 to the excess contribution ) yield :    @xmath86    in order to estimate the @xmath4-dependence of our result , we have also calculated the entropy cost which corresponds to the removal of 2 he - particles surrounded by 126 h , and 4 he - particles surrounded by 252 h , for the same thermodynamic conditions ( density and energy ) as for the \\{1 he , 63 h } system .",
    "these computations are much more time consuming ( the computation time scales roughly as @xmath87 ) , and the removal of the helium atom must be done 2 and 4 times , respectively . we expect a very small dependence of the results on the size ( @xmath4 ) of the simulated system .",
    "indeed , we do not calculate the chemical potential of _ one _ he atom but the chemical potential of a constant @xmath88 ( @xmath891/64 ) of he in a h - he mixture . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the results stems from the interaction between a he atom with its replicas ( due to the periodic condition boundaries ) and from the fact that the accessible phase space increases with the total number of atoms .",
    "the first effect becomes important when the characteristic length of interaction is of the same order as the simulated box , _ i.e. _ at much higher density than the present simulations .",
    "quantification of the second effect requires simulations with different values of @xmath4 .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab - ndep ] .",
    "the chemical potential is estimated with a centered scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ the chemical potential corresponding to a helium fraction @xmath891/128=0.008 is evaluated from the entropy difference between the \\{0 he , 63 h } system and the \\{1 he , 63 h } system ( with full interaction ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on @xmath90 are @xmath91 for the \\{1 he , 63 h } and \\{2 he , 126 h } systems , and @xmath92 for the \\{4 he , 252 h } one ( achieving the same statistical uncertainties scales as @xmath93 ) .",
    "the results between the three systems for a he fraction equal to 0.008 , as shown in the table , are thus fully compatible , and no statistically - significant trend appears .",
    "the same simulations yield also the estimation of the helium chemical potential for different number fractions .",
    "all the results are given in table [ tab - ndep ] , and are compatible within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "for the \\{1 he , 63 h } mixture , we have also conducted calculations for two other thermodynamic conditions , displayed in table [ tab - diffthermo ] . as expected intuitively",
    ", it is easier to add an atom in a low density plasma than in a high density one ( at constant total energy ) , or in a cold plasma than in a hot one ( at constant density ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the limit of rigid electronic background at high density for the binary ionic mixture , the so - called bim limit @xcite @xcite .",
    "our reference conditions , @xmath94 hartree and @xmath69 bohr@xmath70 , _ i.e. _ @xmath71 , correspond to @xmath95 k , @xmath96 gpa and @xmath97 ( table [ tab - ndep ] ) in the simulation . for this density and temperature",
    ", the bim corresponds to @xmath98 gpa and @xmath99 .",

    "<S> the choice of this simple functional is motivated by the fact that the present paper is devoted to the derivation and the validation of the method but more complicated functionals can and will be implemented in the future . this new method is applied in the microcanonical ensemble , the most natural ensemble for molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids the introduction of a thermostat in the simulation , and thus uncontroled modifications of the trajectories calculated from the forces between particles . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are conducted for three values of the input thermodynamic quantities , energy and density , and for different total numbers of particles in order to examine the uncertainties due to finite size effects . </S>",
    "<S> this method and these calculations lie the basic foundation to study the thermodynamic stability of dense mixtures , without any _ a priori _ assumption on the degree of ionization of the different species . </S>"
