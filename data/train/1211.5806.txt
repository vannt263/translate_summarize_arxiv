    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period interacting binary stars , consisting of a white dwarf primary and a low - mass late spectral type secondary star .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe and transfers matter to the primary via a gas stream and an accretion disc .",
    "accretion disc formation is prevented in systems with strongly magnetic white dwarfs in which mass accretion continues through accretion columns . for a detailed review of observational properties of cvs , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the long - term evolution of cataclysmic variables as a function of the secondary star metallicity .",
    "they showed that pop ii cvs with a low metallicity secondary star have a detached phase with a smaller orbital period width , a shorter minimum period @xcite and a slightly higher mass transfer rate , resulting in shorter evolutionary timescales compared to cvs where the secondary star has a solar chemical composition . according to their population synthesis model , most pop ii cvs",
    "are expected to be found below the period gap @xcite .",
    "@xcite express that the high @xmath0 velocities ( systemic velocities or center of mass velocities ) of some systems found by @xcite suggest these systems to be pop ii cvs .",
    "however , most of these cvs are magnetic systems ( dq her and am her stars ) , where the doppler - shifts of spectral lines originate mainly from the accretion stream .",
    "consequently , the errors in the @xmath0 velocities may be noticeably high .",
    "still , finding magnetic systems below the period gap should not be a surprise as these systems concentrate towards shorter orbital periods , with little evidence for a period gap @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this narrow ( or none ) period gap is consistent with the predictions from the study of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite found magnetic systems to be much older than non - magnetic systems while they also emphasized doubts about the reliability of @xmath0 velocities obtained from the observations of magnetic systems .",
    "some cvs have been suggested to be the members of old populations in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "clearly , it is hard to detect thick disc and halo cvs if they are not outbursting systems .",
    "cvs in globular clusters could be detected from their outbursts , emission lines , x - rays or their blue colours .",
    "low metallicity values extracted from spectra can be another indicator for thick disc and halo cvs @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic confirmation of these detections is difficult as they are very faint systems . for a detailed discussion on the detection of cvs in globular clusters",
    ", we refer to knigge s ( @xcite ) review and references therein .    a reasonable observable sample of pop ii cvs ( thick disc and halo cvs )",
    "can only be found at vertical distances from the galactic plane @xmath1 @xmath2 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , the faintness of cvs restricts most of their photometric and spectroscopic studies to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "although some abundance anomalies in uv and ir were found for cvs @xcite , there are no reliable metallicity measurements for cvs . in the absence of metallicity measurements , only kinematical and the dynamical methods",
    "are expected to provide reliable results in the recognition of the thick disc and halo cvs in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "although the development of sensitive ccd cameras , spectrographs and larger size telescopes made it possible to observe relatively faint cvs , we lack the necessary observational information to understand the kinematical properties of cvs in the galactic scales .    in the next section we use the kinematical properties of 159 cvs in the solar neighbourhood to distinguish different galactic populations among them .",
    "the kinematical data used in this study are taken from @xcite .",
    "the most important inputs used in their study are distances , @xmath0 velocities and proper motions .",
    "the proper motions of cvs were mostly obtained from the nomad catalogue @xcite .",
    "the types , equatorial coordinates and orbital periods of cvs were mostly taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition 7.7 ) and @xcite .",
    "the distances were predicted using the plcs relation of @xcite .",
    "the plcs relation is based on orbital period and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) jhk@xmath3 photometric data @xcite .",
    "this relation is reliable and valid in the ranges @xmath4 @xmath5p@xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 mag . for a detailed description of the method by the plcs relation",
    ", we refer to ak et al.s ( @xcite ) studies .",
    "the distances obtained from this relation differ in general less than 4@xmath10 from those obtained from trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the last important inputs used in @xcite are the radial velocities which are used to calculate total space velocities .",
    "the radial velocity with respect to the sun comes from measurements of doppler - shifts in spectral lines .",
    "however , one has to take here into account that cvs are binaries , and thus one has to determine the radial velocity of the center of mass of the system .",
    "@xcite adopted the criteria defined by @xcite when collecting @xmath0 velocities from the literature and merged these @xmath0 velocities with those collected by @xcite .",
    "radial velocities , and consequently @xmath0 velocities , derived from emission lines are likely affected by the motion in the accretion disc or the matter stream falling on the disc from the secondary .",
    "thus , @xcite analyzed @xmath0 velocities statistically and looked for possible systematic errors in the @xmath0 values obtained from emission lines .",
    "they concluded that there is no substantial systematic difference between systemic velocities derived from emission and absorption lines and that the observed @xmath0 velocities can be reliably used for statistical analysis ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "from the celestial coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , proper motion components ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , systemic velocity ( @xmath0 ) and the parallax ( @xmath15 ) , @xcite computed galactic space velocities and their propagated errors with respect to the sun using the algorithms and transformation matrices of @xcite .",
    "although the sampled cvs are relatively nearby objects , @xcite applied corrections for differential galactic rotation to space velocities as described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the propagated errors of space velocities , with respect to lsr ( local standart of rest ) , and refined their sample by removing systems with a total space velocity error @xmath16 @xmath17 30 km s@xmath18 .",
    "although they collected input data from the literature for 194 cvs , this analyses decreased the number of usable systems in their sample to 159 . in this study ,",
    "the final sample of 159 cvs in @xcite is used to calculate the galactic orbital parameters of systems .      in order to determine possible galactic orbits of cvs ,",
    "we first perform test - particle integration in a milky way potential which consists of a logarithmic halo of the form    @xmath19    with @xmath20 km s@xmath18 and @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the disc is represented by a miyamoto - nagai potential :    @xmath22    with @xmath23 , @xmath24 kpc and @xmath25 kpc .",
    "finally , the bulge is modelled as a hernquist potential ,    @xmath26    using @xmath27 and @xmath28 kpc .",
    "the superposition of these components gives a good representation of the milky way .",
    "the circular speed at the solar radius is taken @xmath29220 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the orbital period of the lsr is @xmath30 years while @xmath31 km s@xmath18 denotes the circular rotational velocity at the solar galactocentric distance , @xmath32 kpc .",
    "the same formulae were already used to determine the galactic orbits of objects from different classes , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .    in order to analyse galactic orbits of cvs , the mean radial galactocentric distance ( @xmath33 )",
    "is taken into account as a function of the stellar population and the orbital shape .",
    "we consider the planar and vertical orbital eccentricities , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is defined as the arithmetic mean of the final perigalactic ( @xmath36 ) and apogalactic ( @xmath37 ) distances , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the final maximum and minimum distances , respectively , to the galactic plane whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as follows :    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    respectively , where @xmath42 @xcite . due to @xmath1-excursions @xmath36 and @xmath37 can vary , however this variation is not more than 5@xmath10 .",
    "calculated orbital parameters of the 159 cvs are listed in table 1 . the columns of the table are organized as follows : name , equatorial ( @xmath43 ) coordinates , the final perigalactic ( @xmath36 ) and apogalactic ( @xmath37 ) distances , the maximum ( @xmath38 ) and minimum ( @xmath39 ) distances to the galactic plane , total orbital angular momentum ( @xmath44 ) , and the planar ( @xmath34 ) and vertical ( @xmath35 ) orbital eccentricities .",
    "apogalactic and perigalactic distances are determined from the averaged maximum and minimum galactocentric distances of systems in the calculated galactic orbits within the integration time of 3 gyr , i.e. backwards in time over an interval of 3 gyr .",
    "this integration time is chosen to correspond to 12 or 15 revolutions around the galactic center so that the averaged orbital parameters can be determined reliably .      in order to determine the population types of the cvs , we define some dynamical and kinematical criteria . the criteria defined to select thick disc or halo cvs are as following :    1 .   the total space velocity ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that stars with @xmath46 100 km s@xmath18 are thick disc or halo objects .",
    "the relative probability for thick disc to thin disc membership ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that the stars with @xmath48 are thick disc or halo objects .",
    "the maximum distance from the galactic plane ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is well known that the thick disk is the dominant component of the galaxy between 1 and 5 kpc above the galactic disc while halo objects have @xmath38 values larger than 5 kpc @xcite .",
    "4 .   vertical orbital eccentricity ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that vertical eccentricities of galactic orbits calculated for the thick - disc and halo stars are larger than @xmath290.1 .",
    "planar eccentricity of the galactic orbit ( @xmath34 ) . using main - sequence stars",
    ", @xcite found that stars with @xmath34 @xmath2 0.3 belong to the thick disc .",
    "@xmath47 is calculated using a purely kinematical approach described by @xcite .",
    "these probabilities were estimated and listed by @xcite . according to the criteria defined by @xcite",
    "the stars are selected from four different @xmath47 intervals : @xmath49 ( i.e. `` high probability thin - disc stars '' ) ; @xmath50 ( i.e. `` low probability thin - disc stars '' ) ; @xmath51 ( i.e. `` low probability thick - disc stars '' ) and @xmath52 ( i.e. `` high probability thick - disc stars '' ) .",

    "our results is consistent with this suggestion .",
    "in this study we calculated , for the first time , the galactic orbital parameters of a large number of cvs . we also determined their population types using these calculations and the kinematical parameters as found by @xcite    our analysis shows that almost all of the cvs in the sample are in the thin disc component of the galaxy . only nine cvs in the sample are thick disc stars .",

    "it is found that the fraction of thick disc cvs to thin disc cvs in the sample is @xmath296@xmath10 which is in very good agreement with the fraction of pop ii field stars to pop i field stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "this suggests that our cv sample is complete for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "so , we conclude that statistical studies using this sample give reliable and self - consistent results .",
    "@xcite found that the middle point of the period gap is at 2.62 hr for the objects in the sample .",
    "an inspection of the thick disc cvs in table 2 reveals that @xmath2960@xmath10 of thick disc cvs are located below the orbital period gap .",

    "although 21 of them are included in our sample , only one of them ( ak cnc ) is identified as a thick disc cv in this study .",
    "it must be emphasized that the galactic latitude is not a reliable indicator for the population type of an object .",
    "our analysis shows that the most probable thick disc cvs in table 2 have high galactic angular momentums , implying that they are in a population different than the thin disc ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as thick disc and halo objects have eccentric orbits , they can pass through the solar neighbourhood during their nuclear evolution .",
    "that is why the analysis of galactic orbits is very important in the determination of population types .",
    "the dispersion of the total space velocities is an indicator of population types , as the velocity dispersion of a group of objects is related to their kinematical age .",
    "the total space velocities of the six systems with @xmath38 @xmath2 1 kpc in table 2 were taken from @xcite and the dispersion of the total space velocities is calculated as 101 km s@xmath18 . using the equation given by @xcite and @xcite , the kinematical age of the six most probable thick disc cvs in the sample",
    "is calculated as 13 gyr .",
    "this value is consistent with the age of the thick disc population in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "our study shows that there are thick disc cvs in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "our study also implies that halo cvs , if they are present , must be very rare in the vicinity of the sun .",
