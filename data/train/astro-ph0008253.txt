    "most submillimeter - wave radiation from astronomical sources is absorbed by irregular concentrations of atmospheric water vapor before it reaches the earth s surface ; ground - based submillimeter - wave observations are beset by nearly opaque , variable skies .",
    "astronomers have therefore sought high , arid sites for new submillimeter telescopes , to find better transparency and reduced sky noise . among the most promising sites for submillimeter - wave astronomy",
    "is south pole , an exceptionally dry and cold site which has unique logistical opportunities and challenges .",
    "summer - only submillimeter observations from south pole were begun by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a year - round observatory has been established in the past decade by the center for astrophysical research in antarctica ( cara ) , an nsf science and technology center .",
    "cara has fielded several major telescope facilities : ast / ro ( the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory , a 1.7-m telescope ( see figure  [ fig : astro ] ) , python and viper ( cosmic microwave background experiments ) , dasi ( the degree - angular scale interferometer ) , and spirex ( the south pole infrared explorer , a 60-cm telescope , now decommissioned ) .",
    "these facilities are conducting site characterization and astronomical investigations from millimeter wavelengths to the near - infrared ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also url http://astro.uchicago.edu/cara ) .",
    "ast / ro was installed at south pole in austral summer 1994 - 1995 @xcite , and was the first submillimeter - wave telescope to operate on the antarctic plateau in winter .",
    "ast / ro is designed for astronomy and aeronomy with heterodyne and bolometric detectors at wavelengths between 3 mm and @xmath1 .",
    "an up - to - date list of scientific publications and technical memoranda from ast / ro may be found at the observatory website at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/@xmath2adair/ast_ro .",
    "observing time on ast / ro is now open to proposals from the worldwide astronomical community .",

    "the ast / ro telescope is located in the _ dark sector _ of the united states national science foundation amundsen - scott south pole station .",
    "the station provides logistical support for the observatory : room and board for on - site scientific staff , electrical power , network and telephone connections , heavy equipment support , and cargo and personnel transport .",
    "the station powerplant provides about 25 kw of power to the ast / ro building out of a total generating capacity of about 490 kw .",
    "south pole has been continuously populated since the first station was built in november 1956 .",
    "the current station was built in 1975 , and new structures have been added in subsequent years to bring the housing capacity to 210 people in austral summer and 45 in the austral winter .",
    "new station facilities are under construction and are expected to be operational by 2005 .",
    "these include living quarters for a winter - over staff of 50 , a new powerplant with greater generating capacity , and a new laboratory building .",
    "heavy equipment at south pole station includes cranes , forklifts , and bulldozers ; these can be requisitioned for scientific use as needed .",
    "the station is supplied by over 200 flights each year of lc130 ski - equipped cargo aircraft .",
    "annual cargo capacity is about 3500 tons .",
    "aircraft flights are scheduled from late october to early - february so that the station is inaccessible for as long as nine months of the year .",
    "this long _ winter - over _ period is central to all logistical planning for polar operations .",
    "the sis receivers used on ast / ro each require about 2 liters of liquid helium per day .",
    "as of mid-2000 , total usage of liquid helium at south pole averages 30 liters per day for all experiments .",
    "one or two helium - filled weather balloons are launched each day .",
    "there is an ongoing loss of helium from the station , as it is used for a variety of experiments . the national science foundation and its support contractors must supply helium to south pole , and the most efficient way to transport and supply helium is in liquid form .",
    "before the winter - over period , one or more large ( 4000 to 12000 liter ) storage dewars are brought to south pole for winter use ; some years this supply lasts the entire winter , but in 1996 and 2000 it did not . in december 1998 , no helium was available during a period scheduled for engineering tests , resulting in instrumental problems for ast / ro during the subsequent winter .",
    "the supply of liquid helium has been a chronic problem for ast / ro and for south pole astronomy , but improved facilities in the new station should substantially improve its reliability .",
    "internet and telephone service to south pole is provided by a combination of two low - bandwidth satellites , les-9 and goes-3 , and the high - bandwidth ( 3 mbps ) nasa tracking and data relay satellite system tdrs - f1 .",
    "these satellites are geosynchronous but not geostationary , since their orbits are inclined .",
    "geostationary satellites are always below the horizon and can not be used .",
    "internet service is intermittent through each 24-hour period because each satellite is visible only during the southernmost part of its orbit ; the combination of the three satellites provides an internet connection for approximately 12 hours within the period 116 hr greenwich lst .",
    "the tdrs link helps provide a store - and - forward automatic transfer service for large computer files .",
    "the total data communications capability is about 5 gbytes per day .",
    "ast / ro typically generates 12 mbytes per day .",
    "additional voice communications are provided by a fourth satellite , ats-3 , and high frequency radio .",
    "on ast / ro , all engineering operations for equipment installation and maintenance are tied to the annual cycle of physical access to the instrument .",
    "plans and schedules are made in march and april for each year s deployment to south pole : personnel on - site , tasks to be completed , and the tools and equipment needed .",
    "all equipment must be ready for shipment by the end of september .",
    "orders for new equipment should be complete by june and new equipment should be tested and ready to ship by august . for quick repairs and upgrades , it is possible to send equipment between south pole and anywhere serviced by commercial express delivery in about five days during the austral summer season .",
    "ast / ro group members deploy to south pole in groups of two to six people throughout the austral summer season , carry out their planned tasks as well as circumstances allow , and return , after stays ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months .",
    "each year there is an ast / ro _ winter - over scientist _ , a single person who remains with the telescope for one year . the winter - over scientist position is designed to last three years : one year of preparation and training , one year at south pole with the telescope , and one year after the winter - over year to reduce data and prepare scientific results . if there are no instrumental difficulties , the winter - over scientist controls telescope observations through the automated control program _ obs _",
    "( see  4 ) , carries out routine pointing and calibration tasks , tunes the receivers , and fills the liquid helium dewars .",
    "if instrumental difficulties develop , the winter - over scientist carries out repairs in consultation with ast / ro staff back at their home institutions and with the help of other winter - over staff at south pole .",
    "ast / ro is located on the roof of a dedicated support building across the aircraft skiway in the _ dark sector _ , a grouping of observatory buildings in an area designated to have low radio emissions and light pollution .",
    "the ast / ro building is a single story , @xmath3 , and is elevated @xmath4 above the surface on steel columns to reduce snow drifts .",
    "the interior is partitioned into six rooms , including laboratory and computer space , storage areas , a telescope control room , and a coud room containing the receivers on a large optical table directly under the telescope .",
    "ast / ro is a prototype , the first submillimeter - wave telescope to operate year - round on the antarctic plateau . as such",
    ", its operation has been an experiment , minimally staffed and supported , intended to demonstrate feasibility and to identify areas of difficulty .",
    "a unique challenge of south pole operations is the lack of transport for personnel and equipment during the nine month winter - over period .",
    "spare or replacement parts for most of the critical system assemblies have been obtained , shipped to south pole station , and stored in the ast / ro building . in a typical year",
    ", failure occurs in two or three system subassemblies , such as a drive system power supply or a submillimeter - wave local oscillator chain .",
    "usually a repair or work - around is effected by the winter - over scientist .",
    "there are , however , single points of failure which can cause the cessation of observatory operations until the end of the winter . between 1995 and 2000 , observations or engineering tests were planned for a total of 54 months , of which about half were successful .",
    "the most important cause of telescope downtime has been incapacitation of the single winter - over scientist , resulting in 14 months of lost time .",
    "failure of the liquid helium supply was responsible for a further 11 months of lost time .",
    "in future , both of these causes for failure will be substantially reduced . starting in 2002",
    ", it is planned that ast / ro will field two winter - over scientists . beginning in 2003",
    ", the completion of a new liquid helium supply facility as part of the new south pole station modernization plan will eliminate single points of failure for the liquid helium supply .",
    "the sky is opaque to submillimeter wavelengths at most observatory sites .",
    "submillimeter astronomy can only be pursued from dry , frigid sites , where the atmosphere contains less than 1 mm of precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) .",
    "water vapor is usually the dominant source of opacity , but thousands of other molecular lines contribute @xcite a _ dry air _ component to the opacity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the dry air opacity is relatively more important at the south pole than at other sites .",
    "dry air opacity is less variable than the opacity caused by water vapor , and therefore causes less _",
    "sky noise_. physical parameters of the south pole site of ast / ro are given in table 1 .",
    "the south pole meteorology office has used balloon - borne radiosondes to measure profiles above the south pole of temperature , pressure , and water vapor at least once a day for several decades @xcite .",
    "these have typically shown atmospheric water vapor values about 90% of saturation for air coexisting with the ice phase at the observed temperature and pressure .",
    "the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) values consistent with saturation are , however , extremely low because the air is dessicated by the frigid temperatures . at the south pole s average annual temperature of @xmath5 c ,",
    "the partial pressure of saturated water vapor is only 1.2% of what it is at 0 c @xcite .",
    "judging by other measures of pwv such as lidar and mid - infrared spectroscopy , the calibration of the hygrometers used on balloon sondes was accurate between 1991 and 1996 . on february 22 , 1997",
    ", the balloon radiosonde type was changed from an a.i.r .",
    "model 4a to the a. i. r. model 5a , and the average pwv values indicated by the new radiosondes dropped by 70% ( see figure  [ fig : hygrometer ] ) ; these new values appear to be spuriously low .",
    "a firm upper limit to the pwv can be set by calculating what the pwv would be if the column of air were 100% saturated with water vapor at the observed temperature and pressure , the _ saturation - point pwv_. since the temperature and pressure measurements from balloon sondes are accurate , and since the atmosphere can not be significantly supersaturated , the saturation - point pwv is a reliable upper limit to the true pwv .",
    "values of the saturation - point pwv for a 38 year period are shown in figure  [ fig : satpoint5998 ] @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pwvaveyear ] shows the pwv for each day of the year averaged over all the years in this data set to show the average seasonal variation in the water vapor content of the atmosphere .",
    "_ pwv values at south pole are small , stable , and well - understood . _",
    "quartile values of the distribution of pwv with time are plotted in figure  [ fig : pwvbargraph ] ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where they are compared with corresponding values for mauna kea and for the proposed alma site at chajnantor .",
    "the relation between pwv and measured opacity at 225  ghz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s. foster , private communication ) was used to derive the pwv values for mauna kea and chajnantor .",
    "recent fourier transform spectrometer results from mauna kea @xcite show that this pwv-@xmath6 relation may overestimate pwv by about 12% .",
    "the data are separated into the best 6-month period and the remainder of the year .",
    "of the three sites , south pole has by far the lowest pwv , during austral summer as well as winter .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter - wave atmospheric opacity at south pole has been measured using skydip techniques . @xcite",
    "made over 1100 skydip observations at 492  ghz ( 609 ) with ast / ro during the 1995 observing season .",
    "even though this frequency is near a strong oxygen line , the opacity was below 0.70 half of the time during the austral winter and reached values as low as 0.34 , better than ever measured at any ground - based site .",
    "the stability was also remarkably good : the opacity remained below 1.0 for weeks at a time .",
    "the 225  ghz ( 1.33 mm ) skydip data for south pole were obtained during 1992 @xcite using a standard nrao tipping radiometer similar to the ones used to measure the 225 ghz zenith opacities at mauna kea and chajnantor , and the results are summarized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tight linear relation between 225 ghz skydip data and balloon sonde pwv measurements is discussed by @xcite .    from early 1998 ,",
    "the 350@xmath7 m ( 850 ghz ) band has been continuously monitored at mauna kea , chajnantor , and south pole by identical tipper instruments developed by s. radford of nrao and j. peterson of carnegie - mellon u. and cara .",
    "results from south pole are compared to chajnantor and mauna kea in figure  [ fig : threesites ] .",
    "these instruments measure a broad band that includes the center of the 350 window as well as more opaque nearby wavelengths .",
    "comparison of the @xmath8 values measured by these instruments is tightly correlated with occasional narrow - band skydip measurements made within this band by the cso and ast / ro ; the narrow band @xmath8 values are about a factor of two smaller than those output by the broadband instrument . _",
    "the 350  opacity at south pole is consistently better than at mauna kea or chajnantor . _",
    "the simulations shown in figure [ fig : pardo ] were made with the  atmospheric transmission at microwaves \" ( atm ) model @xcite .",
    "they include all water and oxygen lines up to 10 thz and account for the non - resonant excess of water vapor absorption and collision - induced absorption of the dry atmosphere according to the results of @xcite .",
    "for the comparison we have plotted typical transmission profiles for the three sites calculated for winter time 25% pwv quartiles . for south pole , we use 0.19 mm pwv @xcite . for mauna kea and chajnantor",
    "we use the values 0.9 and 0.6 mm , respectively .",
    "the collision - induced non - resonant absorption of the dry atmosphere is higher at south pole due to the higher ground level pressure compared with the other two sites .",
    "the much smaller pwv levels of south pole , however , make its total zenith submillimeter - wave transmission considerably better than chajnantor and mauna kea .",
    "the success or failure of various submillimeter - wave observational techniques depends critically on atmospheric opacity . just as it makes no sense to carry out visual - wavelength photometry in cloudy weather",
    ", there is an atmospheric opacity above which any particular submillimeter - wave observational technique will fail to give usable results .",
    "this threshold depends on the details of the particular technique and its sensitivity to the spectrum of atmospheric noise , but for many techniques the threshold lies near @xmath9 .",
    "weather conditions above the threshold can not be compared to those below the threshold by simple gaussian noise analysis : ten days where @xmath10 can never be the equivalent of one day where @xmath11 . for deep background experiments , it is important to choose the best possible site .",
    "_ sky noise _ refers to fluctuations in total power or phase of a detector caused by variations in atmospheric emissivity and path length on timescales of order one second .",
    "sky noise causes systematic errors in the measurement of astronomical sources . in an instrument that is well - designed , meaning that it has no intrinsic systematic noise ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sky noise will determine the minimum flux that can be observed , the flux below which the instrument will no longer  integrate down \" .",
    "this flux limit is proportional to the power in the sky noise spectral energy distribution at the switching frequency of the observing equipment .",
    "@xcite show analytically how sky noise causes observational techniques to fail : fluctuations in a component of the data due to sky noise integrates down more slowly than @xmath12 and will come to dominate the error during long observations .",
    "sky noise is a source of systematic noise which is not within the control of the instrument designer , and the limits to measurement imposed by sky noise are often reached in ground - based submillimeter - wave instrumentation .",
    "sky noise at south pole is considerably smaller than at other sites at the same opacity .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xcite and shown in figure [ fig : pardo ] , the pwv at south pole is often so low that the opacity is dominated by the _ dry air _ component ; the dry air emissivity and phase error do not vary as strongly or rapidly as the emissivity and phase error due to water vapor .",
    "the spectral energy density of sky noise is determined by turbulence in the atmosphere and has a roughly similar spectral shape at all sites @xcite .",
    "measurement of spectral noise at one frequency can therefore be extrapolated to other frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : threesites ] gives a direct indication of sky noise at submillimeter wavelengths at the largest timescales .",
    "the value @xmath13 is the root - mean - square deviation of opacity measurements made within an hour s time . as a measure of sky noise",
    ", this value has two defects : ( 1 ) during the best weather it is limited by detector noise within the nrao - cmu tipper ( which uses room - temperature bolometers ) rather than sky noise and ( 2 ) the @xmath14 fluctuations it measures are at much lower frequencies than the switching frequencies used for astronomical observations .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is an upper limit to sky noise at very low frequencies ; figure  [ fig : threesites ] nevertheless gives a clear indication that the power in sky noise at south pole is often several times less than at mauna kea or chajnantor .",
    "other instruments are sensitive to sky noise at frequencies near @xmath15 and can be used to give quantitative results over more limited periods of time .",
    "sky noise at south pole has been measured in conjunction with cosmic microwave background experiments on python @xcite and white dish @xcite .",
    "python , with a @xmath16 throw , had @xmath17 sky noise on a median summer day , whereas white dish , which had a @xmath18 throw , was much less affected by sky noise . extrapolating to 218 ghz and a @xmath19 throw ,",
    "the median sky noise is estimated to be @xmath20 even in the austral summer , lower by a factor of ten than the sky noise observed during sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect observations on mauna kea @xcite .",
    "@xcite have compared the python experiment at south pole with the site testing interferometer at chajnantor @xcite .",
    "these are very different instruments , but the differences can be bridged by fitting to a parametric model .",
    "@xcite have developed an atmospheric model for sky noise with a kolmogorov power law with both three- and two - dimensional regimes , and have applied it to data from python and the chajnantor testing interferometer .",
    "they find that the amplitude of the sky noise at south pole is 10 to 50 times less than that at chajnantor .",
    "_ sky noise at south pole is significantly less than at other sites . _",
    "the best observing conditions occur only at high elevation angles , and at south pole this means that only the southernmost 3 steradians of the celestial sphere are accessible with the south pole s uniquely low sky noise  but this portion of sky includes millions of galaxies and cosmological sources , the magellanic clouds , and most of the fourth quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "the strength of south pole as a submillimeter site lies in the low sky noise levels routinely obtainable for sources around the south celestial pole .",
    "this is crucial for large - scale observations of faint cosmological sources observed with bolometric instruments , and for such observations south pole is unsurpassed .",
    "the instrumental design of the ast / ro telescope is described in @xcite .",
    "this section describes the current suite of instrumentation and aspects of the telescope optics which affect observations .",
    "currently , there are five heterodyne receivers mounted on an optical table suspended from the telescope structure in a spacious ( @xmath21 ) , warm coud room :    *   a 230 ghz sis receiver , 5575 k double - sideband ( dsb ) noise temperature ; *   a 450495 ghz sis waveguide receiver , 200400 k dsb @xcite ; *   a 450495 ghz sis quasi - optical receiver , 165250 k dsb @xcite ; *   a 800 - 820 ghz fixed - tuned sis waveguide mixer receiver , 9501500 k dsb @xcite ; *   an array of four 800 - 820 ghz fixed - tuned sis waveguide mixer receivers , 8501500 k dsb ( * ? ? ?",

    "the hrs uses a 5 mw hene - laser at 632 nm wavelength .",
    "the stability of these aos are high , with @xmath22 allan variance minimum time for the two lrs and @xmath23 for the hrs measured at the ast / ro site under normal operating conditions .",
    "the designs of these aos are very similar to the aos used at the kosma observatory @xcite .",
    "all aos are set up for nearly full nyquist sampling of the spectra , the pixel spacing of the lrs is 670 khz at 1.1 mhz resolution bandwidth per pixel , while the hrs has 32 khz pixel spacing at 60 khz resolution bandwidth .",
    "the fluctuation bandwidth of the spectrometers , which is the effective bandwidth per channel appearing in the radiometer equation , is 50% larger than the resolution bandwidth .",
