    "localization of wannier functions ( wf ) has attracted great attention of scientists in the recent years . despite the success of describing most of the physical phenomena in crystals in terms of bloch waves ( bw ) ,",
    "wannier functions have obvious advantages .",
    "to mention a few : wfs provide a chemically intuitive picture of the electronic structure in crystals , using localized wfs , physical quantities such as effective born charges and spontaneous polarization can be evaluated in a very simple way ,  @xcite and they play a central role in many post hartree - fock electron correlation methods .",
    "@xcite    several rigorous schemes for the localization of wfs have been proposed so far .",
    "they fall into two categories , those which are based on the variational principle ,  @xcite and those which are an extension of the foster - boys localization criterion @xcite for periodic systems .",
    "@xcite all these methods can only be applied to isolated band complexes , i.e.  a group of bands which are separated from the other bands by an energy gap over the _ entire _ brillouin zone .",
    "this restriction appreciably confines the possible applications of those methods and only a limited number of systems can be treated . in particular , the energy bands of the unoccupied bloch waves usually do not exhibit any such band gaps .",
    "thus , none of the localization schemes developed so far can be applied routinely to selectively generate virtual wannier functions as needed , for instances , in our wave - function - based post hartree - fock correlation methods for valence _ and _ conduction bands .",
    "@xcite    recently , souza _",
    "et al_.  @xcite have extended the original marzari - vanderbilt localization scheme  @xcite to systems with entangled bands .",
    "the method is based on a preselection of optimal bloch waves having maximal similarity at neighboring @xmath0-points by minimizing a suitable functional . like the original scheme , the new method is especially designed for a plane wave representation of the bws and heavily relies on numerical @xmath0-space differentiations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a similar extension for the wannier - boys localization scheme developed by zicovich - wilson , dovesi and saunders.@xcite this scheme differs in many aspects from the algorithm proposed by marzari _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in particular , it is much better suited for bws given in a linear combination of atomic - like orbital ( lcao ) representation as employed in many widely used program packages for periodic systems such as crystal ,  @xcite gaussian ,  @xcite dmol@xmath1 ,  @xcite nfp - lmto ,  @xcite or band  @xcite ( the periodic variant of adf@xcite ) .    in sec .",

    "the new projective wannier - boys scheme we want to present here sets out from the original wannier - boys ( wb ) localization procedure which is discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "like all localization schemes for composite bands , it relies on the initial specification of a fixed set of energy bands .",
    "these bands determine the space of the bloch functions which are allowed to participate in the multi - band wannier transformation , the so - called active space .",
    "for example , the valence bands of a system can be chosen as such a set of bands .",
    "the wb algorithm is a combination of two steps : the so - called wannierization and a foster - boys localization of the obtained wfs within the reference unit cell .",
    "recently , the algorithm has been extended to operate with a multi - cell foster - boys localization to better preserve the space group symmetry of the system under consideration .",
    "@xcite    the wannierization step starts from a set of trial wannier functions @xmath2 which are linear combinations of atomic - like orbitals @xmath3 we follow the notation from ref .   here .",
    "thus , @xmath4 runs over all atomic basis functions @xmath5 in the reference unit cell , @xmath6 denotes their centers , and @xmath7 runs over all lattice vectors of the underlying bravais lattice . to reduce the spacial extent of each of these wfs , the orbital coefficients @xmath8",
    "are set to zero for all sites @xmath9 at which the atomic mulliken populations@xcite of the given wannier function falls below a certain threshold ( for details see ref .  ) .",
    "the wfs obtained this way , the so - called ` model functions',@xcite are transformed to @xmath0-space , projected onto the active space spanned by the selected bws , orthonormalized again , transformed back to real space , and moved back into the reference unit cell ( if necessary ) .",
    "the resulting ( real ) wfs , @xmath10 , then enter the foster - boys step , where they are subject to an orthogonal transformation @xmath11 that minimizes the spread @xmath12 $ ] given by the functional @xmath13 = \\sum_{s=1}^n\\bigl(\\langle\\omega_s |r^2| \\omega_s\\rangle                         - \\langle\\omega_s |{{\\mbox{\\normalsize \\boldmath $ r$}}}| \\omega_s\\rangle^2\\bigr )    \\quad.\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the number of energy bands involved in the localization . finally , the optimized functions @xmath15 are used as new ( orthonormal ) trial functions for the wannierization and the whole procedure is repeated until convergence is reached .",
    "the discarding of orbital coefficients and the subsequent projection onto the active space is the crucial part of the wb algorithm .",
    "it is combined with a foster - boys localization to ensure localization of the wfs also _ inside _ the unit cells .",
    "the described algorithm performs well for isolated band complexes . in the case of entangled bands",
    ", however , the selection of proper bands to set up a suitable active space becomes problematic . avoided and symmetry allowed crossings between the energy bands in mind and other ,",
    "disturbing energy bands occur , and the orbital character one is looking for is spread over several bws which in turn exhibit more or less strong admixtures from other , contaminating orbitals . to overcome this difficulties give up the concept of an rigid active space , abandon the constraint that the number of selected bloch waves per @xmath0-point has to coincide with the number @xmath14 of wannier functions per unit cell , and allow additional bws to be included in the active space at each @xmath0-point .",
    "the selection of an appropriate @xmath14-dimensional active subspace is then done in the projection step during the wannierization . to this",
    "end the ` model bloch waves ' @xmath16 which are the @xmath0-space transformed of the model functions @xmath17 , are projected onto the active space via @xmath18 with the number @xmath19 of selected bws @xmath20 at each @xmath0-point being at least as large as the number of wfs per unit cell .",
    "the matrices @xmath21 showing up here establish a generalization of the unitary hybridization matrices used in conventional multi - band wannier transformations.@xcite the new projected functions @xmath22 are those functions in the active space which resemble the initial model bloch waves @xmath23 the most .",
    "they span the @xmath14-dimensional subspace used in the subsequent multi - band wannier transformation . in this sense",
    ", the procedure outlined here is very similar to the one proposed by souza _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in particular , our extended projection step during the wannerization can be regarded as an analog to the band preselection scheme used in their method .    as for any hybrid orbitals , the orbital energies @xmath24 of the projected model bloch waves have little in common with the canonical band energies @xmath25 they originate from . yet , by diagonalizing the subblock @xmath26 of the fock operator @xmath27 of the system , @xmath14 new , so - called disentangled energy bands @xmath28 can be obtained . where the contamination of the canonical bws with orbitals of wrong character is small",
    ", the disentangled bands will essentially coincide with the canonical ones .",
    "close to band crossings , where the contamination is larger , they will deviate substantially from the canonical bands in order to be able to follow the chemical nature of the underlying bws . by this",
    "the disentangled bands form an _ effectively _ isolated complex of @xmath14 bands with none of them showing any kinks and cones ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] for more details ) .",
    "the eigenvectors resulting from the diagonalization of @xmath29 can be regarded as sort of optimal bloch wave hybrids with minimal orbital contamination and vanishing off - diagonal terms in the fock operator .",
    "we will refer to these hybrids as disentangled bloch waves .",
    "the _ canonical _ bloch waves @xmath20 , to be included in the active space , can be selected in various ways , for example , by specifying an energy window and taking all bws whose band energies @xmath25 fall into this window .",
    "alternatively , a so - called energy tube around a given pair of reference bands @xmath30 may be used , i.e. all bws with band energies @xmath31\\ ] ] are considered where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are some user - specified energy tolerances .",
    "we have implemented the above projection and rediagonalization scheme as an extension to the original wb localization routine in the crystal 200x code ,  @xcite a precursor of the most recent public version of the crystal program package .",
    "@xcite its ability to disentangle energy bands properly will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] where our method is applied to the virtual bands of _ trans_-polyacetylene , diamond and silicon .",
    "all band structures shown here are calculated on the hartree - fock level of theory .",

    "the localization of the wfs is performed a posteriori with the wb algorithm @xcite as implemented in crystal 200x@xcite in conjunction with our extension for entangled bands which has been built into this version of crystal .    in all cases ,",
    "we focus on the first few , low - lying virtual bands of our systems . because of the larger extent of the localized virtual wannier functions compared to the occupied ones , the former wfs are quite sensitive to the number of @xmath0-points in the monkhorst - pack grid.@xcite we chosed the grids sufficiently fine to remove any ambiguities resulting from the discrete @xmath0-space integration .      _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene ( tpa ) , [hc = ch]@xmath34 , suits perfectly as illustrative example for band disentanglement , because , in the basis set employed here , it exhibits three low - lying entangled virtual bands which are separated from the rest of the unoccupied band structure ( fig .",

    "two different geometries are considered , flat tpa ( the experimental structure ) and a distorted configuration with the hydrogens being bent out - of - plane by 20@xmath38 in such a way that the inversion symmetry of the polymer is preserved .",

    "the symmetry separation is perfect , for the distorted structure some mixture between @xmath41 and @xmath40 bonds occurs .",
    "nevertheless , the two types of bws remain quite different in their orbital character which should facilitate the band disentanglement significantly . in this sense , our first system very much resembles the one chosen by souza _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite they used copper which exhibits a @xmath44 band manifold which is entangled with a single @xmath45 valence band .    of course , for tpa one could localize the virtual bloch waves by means of the original wb algorithm .",
    "but what we want to demonstrate here , is that it is also possible to localize the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands _",
    "separately_. we first consider the flat tpa chain . in that case , the bws come in two different symmetries and the disentanglement could simply be achieved by a proper labeling of the energy bands and the associated bloch waves . yet , such symmetry classifications are hard to implement in localization schemes for periodic systems , and thus usually not exploited .",

    "the apparently extremely weak coupling of the two bands is due to ` soft symmetry selection rules'.@xcite that means , the impact of the c - c bond length alternation in tpa on the c  h anti - bond dominated @xmath54 bands is so small that they essentially behave as if there would exist an additional glide plane symmetry in the system ( like in equidistant tpa ) .",
    "this concept is corroborated by a detailed analysis of the involved bloch waves .    a more interesting situation for band disentanglement",
    "arises when the symmetry of the system is lowered by moving the hydrogen atoms out of plane .",

    "after having demonstrated that our projective wannier - boys scheme is able to separate energy bands appropriately , the effect of the disentanglement on the locality of the resulting wannier functions should be addressed . for that purpose",
    "we turn our attention to the more complex case of bulk materials , diamond and silicon in our case .      because of the rather diffuse , atom - optimized basis functions present in the original carbon cc - pvtz basis set of dunning,@xcite ( outermost @xmath56 and @xmath57 exponents of 0.1285 and 0.1209 , respectively ) it can not be used for a hartree - fock calculation of bulk diamond .",

    "the bws from the upper part of this crossing are excluded from the active space while those of the lower part are present , and it seems that there is still a substantial part of the necessary orbital character present in this upper bws to cause the abrupt change in the uppermost disentangled band . obviously , the @xmath77 valence orbital character moves up much higher into the unoccupied band structure of silicon than one might expect at first glance .",
    "this is the reason why we switched to the larger energy window of @xmath79  ev , though a non - negligible upwards shift of the disentangled virtual bands arises .",
    "nevertheless we consider the disentangled bands and bloch orbitals from the enlarged energy window to be the more appropriate ones .",

    "the spatial extent of them is found to be controllable by the size of the active space , i.e. , the number of selected bloch waves per @xmath0-point .",
    "the more bloch waves are considered , the more compact the localized wannier functions become . yet , at the same time , an increasing tendency for an overall upwards shift in the energies of the disentangled bands is observed .",
    "the same trend is discernible in the kohn - sham energies of silicon discussed by souza _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite though , because of the tight energy window employed there ( up to @xmath8311  ev ) , the effect is not very pronounced .",
    "the spread of the maximally localized virtual wannier function of silicon reported there is 30.13  bohr@xmath66 ( based on a @xmath84 monkhorst - pack grid ) which is quite close to the value of 33.03  bohr@xmath66 we found for the @xmath72  ev energy window .",
    "the choice of the systems considered here was not accidental .",
    "subsequent use of the localized wannier functions in wave - function - based post hartree - fock correlation methods for periodic systems which explicitly exploit the local character of virtual wannier functions was the driving force of this work , for example the method used in our study of the valence and conduction bands of _ trans_-polyacetylene@xcite or in analogue investigations of the band structure of bulk materials like diamond.@xcite the more compact the wannier functions are the better these local correlation methods perform .",
    "we thank the crystal group in torino for making available to us the source code of the crystal 200x code without which the present study would not have been possible ."
