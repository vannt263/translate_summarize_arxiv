    "the study of the systems with strongly correlated electrons has become in the last time one of the central problem of condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the most important models of strongly correlated electrons is periodic anderson model ( pam)@xmath2}$ ] .",
    "this model is used to describe the physics of mixed valence systems , heavy fermion compounds , high - temperature superconductivity as well as other phenomena in which the strong coulomb repulsion of the localized electrons is present .",
    "this model describes the intermetallic compounds which contain magnetic moments of rare earth or actinide ions included in the host metal .",
    "this ions have a partially filled @xmath0 shell and can be considered as scattering centers for conduction electrons of the host metal . because of the strong coulomb repulsion of the electrons with opposite spins located at the same site of lattice",
    "the magnetic ion electrons are strongly correlated .",
    "there is also the hybridization of states between the uncorrelated conduction electrons and localized correlated ones when both of them are present on the same lattice site .",
    "magnetic properties of the impurities ions affect in a different manner the properties of the host matrix and of the system as a whole . for different regime of physical parameters , determined by coulomb local interaction , hybridization of the wave functions and exchange interaction ,",
    "it is possible to obtain different classes of the system phases .",
    "there are already an enormous number of approximate methods and approaches devoted to pam , as perturbation expansions , static and dynamic mean field theories , variational and numerical approaches , large @xmath3 expansion , slave boson methods , non crossing approximations ( nca ) , bogoliubov inequality method and others .",
    "also some exact results are known , obtained in special with the bethe ansatz , renormalization group methods and bogoliubov inequality method .",
    "we will not enlarge upon the most essential stages in the development of this model because exists a number of consistent reviews @xmath4}$ ] and books @xmath5}$ ] on this field and we shall use the references to previous our papers .",
    "we consider the simplest form of pam with a spin degeneration of the level of localized @xmath0 electrons , a simple energy band of conducting @xmath1 electrons , coulomb one - site repulsion @xmath6 of correlated @xmath0 electrons with opposite spins and one - site hybridization between both group of electrons of this system .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads : @xmath7 where @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the hybridization amplitude assumed constant .",
    "we have indicated with @xmath10 the creation operator for an uncorrelated ( correlated ) electron with spin @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattice site , @xmath13 is the number operator for @xmath0 electrons , @xmath14 is the band energy with momentum @xmath15 of conductivity electrons spread on the entire width @xmath16 of the band .",

    "the strong on - site repulsion @xmath6 between @xmath0 electrons of opposite spins is the main term in the hamiltonian .    as the conduction electrons can belong not only to the @xmath20 but also to the @xmath21 atomic shell",

    "it is obvious that at @xmath23 in the given model with two subsystems superconductivity arises simultaneously in both subsystems .    in the present paper",
