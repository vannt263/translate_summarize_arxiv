    "to fully understand the complex processes and ecosystems which influence the structure and evolution of the galaxy , it is essential to have panoramic surveys of high angular resolution and sensitivity . the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ; mills 1981 , mills 1985 , robertson 1991 ) has at present the largest collecting area of cm - wavelength radio telescopes in the southern hemisphere . with sub - arcmin resolution and brightness sensitivity of @xmath6",
    "k it is very well suited to imaging the galactic plane which has radio emission detectable on a wide range of angular and intensity scales .    the second epoch molonglo galactic plane survey ( mgps-2 ) was undertaken concurrently with the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; bock , large & sadler 1999 , mauch et al .",
    "2003 ) to produce deep imaging coverage of the whole sky south of @xmath7 , which is the northern limit of most for a fully synthesized image .",
    "the scale and detail provided by mgps-2 makes it a valuable asset in undertaking multwavelength studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "mgps-2 covers an area of 2400 deg@xmath8 defined as @xmath9 with @xmath1 in radio continum at 843  mhz with an angular resolution of @xmath2cosec(@xmath10 ) .",
    "the overarching goal of mgps-2 was to study the processes and structures in the ism and how they might increase our understanding of the star formation cycle .",

    "this paper presents the complete set of images from mgps-2 with the goals of identifying a sample of new supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the diffuse extended emission seen in the survey and investigating the large filamentary structures which may not be discrete sources but part of the larger galactic scaffolding .",
    "representative images of the survey are shown here and the complete set of mosaics can be found at www.physics.usyd.edu.au/sifa/main/mgps2 .    in section 2 , we review the observations and data products from mgps-2 .",
    "section 3 presents the new snr candidates and the search criteria used .",
    "section 4 describes the extended filamentary structures which appear to be predominantly thermal and a property of the ism rather than discrete sources . in section 5",

    "the telescope produces a fully synthesised image of an area @xmath12 deg@xmath13 in 12 hours for declinations @xmath14 .",
    "the mgps-2 is a survey of the galactic plane undertaken concurrently with the extragalactic sumss survey over the period 1997 to 2006 .",
    "the technical specifications of the telescope and the survey parameters are given in table 1 .    because of the complexity and strength of the emission from the galactic plane the data quality is dynamic range limited and the strategy for observations was to complete the coverage expeditiously since achieving uniform sensitivity was not possible .",
    "the data are not noise limited .",
    "the confusion limit for the telescope , with its given frequency and angular resolution , is 120  @xmath15jy beam@xmath5 , well below the @xmath16 rms achieved for the survey .",
    "the pointing grid for observations is shown in figure 1 , taken from murphy et al .",
    "the sensitivity varies with declination , the relative position in the field of view and the operational performance of the telescope .",
    "the telescope forms fan beams on the sky which are then accumulated over the course of an observation .",
    "it does not record @xmath11-visibilities and hence , the calibration of individual baselines is not possible .",
    "however , the telescope elements are combined so that most baselines are observed many times , making the array highly redundant .",
    "the calibration of the telescope for both flux density and position is described in bock et al .",
    "the calibration is based on a sample of strong unresolved sources measured by campbell - wilson & hunstead ( 1994 ) .",
    "the shortest baseline that the telescope records is 16 m , which means that smooth structures with a scale larger than @xmath17 are resolved out and the total fluxes of large sources are underestimated .",
    "however , the telescope is very sensitive to filaments and edges .",
    "there is no opportunity at present to add single dish observations to enable total flux estimates .        after calibration and quality control ,",
    "the individual images were combined into mosaics @xmath18 , which are slightly overlapped for continuity in analysing large - scale structure .",
    "the beam for each mosaic was held constant and was calculated for its central position , which means the southern section of each mosaic has a beam slightly broader than the natural data resolution and the northern part is slightly over - resolved .",
    "the variation is minor for the declination range covered by mgps-2 and was done to enable quantitative analysis of the mosaics .",
    "the pointing centres were chosen to mesh with sumss and are in equatorial , rather than galactic coordinates .",
    "this is to preserve a quantifiable beam shape for each mosaic as the natural observing mode of the telescope is in equatorial .",
    "two representative mosaics from mgps-2 are shown .",

    "there is an asymmetry in the distribution and size of snrs between the northern hemisphere ( 1st and 2nd quadrants ) and the south ( 3rd and 4th quadrants ) , particularly with regard to galactic latitude .",
    "figure 13 shows the distribution with respect to both galactic longitude and latitude",
    ".    the different distribution in longitude may be due to the fact that the south has clear tangent directions along at least 4 spiral arms , resulting in a greater volume of the thin disk of the galaxy being probed , whereas in the northern quadrants , the sightlines cut across smaller sections of the arms .",
    "this is presuming that most snrs are the result of massive star collapse , and these stars are short - lived and do not move far from their nascent molecular clouds , which are distributed close to the plane .",
    "the greater number of snrs found at higher latitude in the northern hemisphere may be due to the larger number of radio telescopes undertaking surveys that are located there , particularly single dishes with lower angular resolution and the capacity to detect total fluxes .",
    "these instruments have an advantage at higher latitude .",
    "close to the plane , confusion is problematic and interferometers are more successful .",
    "it is hoped that the present results ( with sub - arcmin resolution ) will serve as finding charts for the low frequency mwa for future multiwavelength studies .",
    "the structures observed in mgps-2 that are highly filamentary and of irregular morphology are mostly thermal , given their corresponding mir emission .",
    "it may be that these features are the consequence of overlapping snr explosions , whereby the ism becomes a clumpy multiphase medium with a substantial fraction of wim .",
    "the argument for this model is well explained in chapter 39 of draine ( 2011 ) .",
    "more detailed mapping of these structures requires measurement of velocity and hence distance .",
    "radio recombination lines at frequencies just below 1 ghz are a promising avenue , accessible in particular to new widefield instruments such as the australia telescope ska pathfinder ( askap ; johnston et al .",
    "2007 ) and the revitalised molonglo telescope .",
    "one of the challenges is that the morphology of these features does not show the characteristic profile of a shock front , typically seen in snr shells .",
    "their scalloped morphology is frequently similar to the wind - blown bubbles associated with massive stars .",
    "the present survey is not able to distinguish whether the filaments are relics of highly evolved snrs dissipating into the ism or wind - blown bubbles from progenitor stars , such as are seen in the radio continuum images of thermal bubbles reported in wendker et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , cappa et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2002 ) and kantharia et al . ( 2007 ) . in some cases",
    ", there is also a spatial separation between the radio and the mir filaments , occuring around hii regions where the size and compositon of dust grains influences emission ( see example in cohen & green 2001 ) .",
    "the second epoch molonglo galactic plane survey ( mgps-2 ) undertaken with the most has produced a valuable archive of images that can be used as a template for future surveys of variable and transient sources as well as for current studies of the myriad of weak extended sources that the survey reveals .",
    "the survey covers 2400 deg@xmath8 and includes many extragalactic sources , mostly unresolved .",
    "there is also likely to be a number of small diameter young snrs not yet identified .",
    "a search for snr candidates that have a shell - like morphology with an angular diameter at least @xmath52 and an absence of measurable mir emission , from the _ msx _ survey data , has produced 23 new candidates .",
    "included in the list are some candidates which were proposed earlier ( whiteoak & green 1996 ; duncan et al .",
    "1997 ) but not yet confirmed because they were observed with poorer angular resolution or were only able to be compared with the much coarser and less sensitive fir survey from _ iras_. it is planned to observe these candidates with the mwa to understand the evolution of snrs through their low frequency properties . using the molonglo results",
    "will avoid potential confusion limitations with the lower frequency telescope .",
    "the wim contributes  25% to the mass fraction of the galactic ism and may have a very important role to play in modelling the energy budget of the galaxy .",
    "some of the filamentary thermal features may be the result of wind - blown bubbles from massive stars .",
    "however , some features have a braided or more diffuse character , which may be ionisation fronts or signposts of the clumpy multiphase nature of the ism in the spiral arms . a comparison of the morphology of these structures against the hi survey of mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "( 2001 ) may show where future star formation is likely to occur .",
    "the most is owned and operated by the university of sydney , with support from the australian research council and science foundation within the school of physics .",
    "the molonglo observatory site staff , led by the site manager duncan campbell - wilson , are responsible for the smooth and efficient operation of the telescope and have provided exceptional support in managing the operation of the telescope and the observations that have enabled the survey .",
