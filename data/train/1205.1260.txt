    "one mystery in modern cosmology is the identity of the dark matter , which constitutes 23% of the energy density of the current universe . by now",
    ", a host of observations as well as numerical simulations of structure formation have established that dark matter must be cold and collisionless nonbaryonic particles that interact primarily via the gravitational interaction .",
    "since no known particles have these properties , one has to turn to physics beyond the standard model for suitable candidates .",
    "currently , the leading candidates of cold dark matter ( cdm ) are axions and weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the former originates from peccei and quinn s dynamical solution to the strong cp problem @xcite , while the latter naturally arises from r - parity - conserving supersymmetry .    for a long time",
    ", it is believed that the two candidates are indistinguishable on observational grounds , even though fundamentally they are very different .",
    "the reason for this has to do with the fact they can both be viewed as classical approximations of quantum fields , albeit in different limits .",
    "wimps , as fermions , are in the regime of classical particles , in which we take @xmath0 and @xmath1 while keeping their energy @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 finite . on the other hand , axions , as bosons ,",
    "reside in the classical field regime , in which we take @xmath0 and the occupation number @xmath4 for constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 to keep @xmath7 and @xmath8 fixed @xcite .",
    "hence , both behave as a pressureless perfect fluid , and have similar properties as far as large scale structure is concerned . for example , it has been demonstrated that the evolution of cosmological perturbations in an axion bec and ordinary cold dark matter are practically indistinguishable on scales of observational interest provided the bec does not rethermalize @xcite . as such , it is widely held that the verdict on the true identity of dark matter can come only with a direct detection in experiments ( there is of course the possibility that neither candidate is correct ) .",
    "currently , a large number of experiments worldwide are actively searching for both candidates , so far with negative results .",
    "recently , however , it has been pointed out that dark matter axions , being a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , could potentially give rise to novel avenues to differentiate them from wimps . if , for example , thermal contact were established between the axions and photons after big - bang nucleosynthesis and before recombination , various cosmological parameters ( namely the effective number of neutrinos @xmath9 and the primordial abundance of light elements such as @xmath10he , @xmath11he , @xmath12li , etc . ) would change @xcite .",
    "hence , a more precise measurement of @xmath9 by the _ planck _",
    "mission in the near future might help shed light on the identity of dark matter .",
    "in addition to cosmological parameters , the study of the catastrophe structure of inner caustics of galactic halos may provide yet further clues @xcite .",
    "caustics are formed as galaxies accrete dark matter particles in their vicinity during structure formation .",
    "they are surfaces of high density which can be viewed as the envelope of particle trajectories , as dark matter particles fall in and out of the gravitational well .",
    "this process of particle infalling and outfalling occurs repeatedly , and a set of inner ( as well as outer ) caustics form .",
    "it turns out that there exists a dichotomy in the classification of the inner caustics in terms of their catastrophe structure , depending on the distribution of angular momentum of the infalling particles .",
    "the first case is characterized by  net overall rotation \" ( @xmath13 ) , and the corresponding inner caustic is a closed tube whose cross section is a section of the elliptic umbilic ( @xmath14 ) catastrophe , called a `` caustic ring '' .",
    "the second case is characterized by irrotational flow ( @xmath15 ) , which gives rise instead to inner caustics with a tent - like structure .",
    "tidal torque theory predicts that ordinary cold dark matter such as wimps would be irrotational @xcite , hence giving rise to tentlike caustics .",
    "in contrast , `` net overall rotation '' ( @xmath16 vortices ) in an axionic bec would result in ring caustics @xcite .",
    "for the first case (  net overall rotation \" ) , the radii of the caustic rings @xmath17 can be predicted in terms of a single parameter , @xmath18 , under the assumption that the time evolution of the galactic halo is self - similar @xcite .",
    "that is , the phase space structure of the halo is time - independent under appropriate rescaling of all distances , velocities , and densities @xcite .",
    "if initially the overdensity in the halo has the profile @xmath19 , where the parameter @xmath20 is estimated to lie in the range 0.25 to 0.35 from the observed power spectrum of density perturbations on galaxy scales , the prediction for @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the galactic rotation velocity and @xmath23    intriguing hints for caustic rings with radii consistent with the prediction of eq . have been found in a multitude of observations : the distribution of bumps in the rotation curve of the milky way ( mw ) @xcite , and the appearance of a triangular feature in the iras map of the mw in the precise direction tangent to the nearest caustic ring @xcite . outside our home galaxy",
    ", further corroboration can be found in the statistical distribution of bumps in a set of 32 extended and well - measured galactic rotation curves @xcite ; the recent rotation curve of the andromeda galaxy , which shows three bumps at locations consistent with the prediction of ; and gravitational lensing evidence in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "together , these observations lend credence to the argument that an axion bec constitutes a substantial fraction of dark matter .",
    "further evidence that may favor the existence of caustic rings is the recently - discovered monoceros ring of stars , an over - density of stars in the plane of the galaxy at a galactocentric distance of @xmath24 kpc @xcite .",
    "their proximity to the @xmath25 inner caustic has led to speculations that their origin has to do with the presence of the ring @xcite . to test this claim ,",
    "one will have to resort to numerical simulations involving the gravitational field near a caustic ring .",
    "unfortunately , the expression for the gravitation field is in general in the form of an integral , whose evaluation is computationally expensive , rendering numerical simulations difficult .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to help circumvent this difficulty by evaluating the near - field caustic - ring gravitational field by analytical methods .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our calculation of the gravitational field near a caustic ring ( in the limit of infinite radius ) , specializing to the case where @xmath26 , a parameter which we shall define and expect to be close to one , equals unity . in section iii , we compare our analytic results with numerics , to establish the validity of our formulae in section ii .",
    "finally , we note that , building on insights acquired in section ii , we can straightforwardly generalize our calculation to the case where @xmath27 .",
    "the computational method employed in section ii remains applicable , though the algebra becomes more cumbersome . since the generalization is not particularly illuminating , it is omitted in this paper .",
    "much of the discussion in this subsection is taken from @xcite . assuming axial symmetry and that the radius of the ring far exceeds the transverse dimensions of the caustic , the distribution of cdm near a caustic ring at some given time is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the usual cylindrical coordinates @xcite ( the angular coordinates @xmath31 is absent due to rotational symmetry ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 characterize the caustic ring ( see @xcite for a good summary ) .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is a temporal coordinate , and denotes the time when the cdm particle crosses the @xmath34 plane .",
    "hence @xmath35 can be viewed as the age of the particle .",
    "the variable @xmath36 is an angular coordinate , with @xmath37 being the polar angle of the particle at its last turnaround .",
    "hence we have two related sets of variables describing the dynamics of the particles : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the location of the caustic is obtained from eqs . and by solving for the values of @xmath40 and @xmath33 at which the jacobian determinant between the two sets of coordinates vanishes : @xmath41 the density of the dark matter particles in physical space is given by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are solutions to @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the number of solutions @xmath47 represents the number of flows at location @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath48 is the mass of dark matter particles falling in per unit solid angle and time .    for convenience ,",
    "we introduce two new variables @xmath49 the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 have clear physical meanings : @xmath50 is the longitudinal dimension of the caustic ( the caustic extends from @xmath52 to @xmath53 at @xmath34 ) , while @xmath51 is the transverse dimension ( the highest point of the caustic are at @xmath54 ) .    under the assumption that @xmath55 ( i.e. infinite caustic radius ) , the gravitational field @xmath56 is given by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is integrated from @xmath59 to @xmath60 and @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath60 .    performing a coordinate transformation from @xmath63 to @xmath39 and using eq . , and ignoring the spatial variation of @xmath48 over the size of the caustic , we have @xmath64 to simplify the calculation , we introduce the following rescaled variables @xmath65 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath66 . the surface of the caustic",
    "is then given by : @xmath67    from eqs .",
    "and , we see that the caustic extends from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , independent of the value of @xmath26",
    ". however , the highest ( lowest ) point of the caustic @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) does depend on @xmath26 , and is given by @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the caustic possesses a @xmath74 symmetry , as its three cusps rotate into one another under a rotation by @xmath75 .",

    "( for example , based on the iras map of the galactic disk , sikivie estimated in @xcite that the @xmath88 caustic ring has dimensions @xmath89 pc and @xmath90 pc . using the relation @xmath91 ,",
    "one then obtains @xmath92 ) . the @xmath73 case has the additional advantage that the algebra is less complicated .",
    "generalizing to the case @xmath27 is not difficult but rather tedious , and the method used in this paper applies straightforwardly .",
    "our goal in this section is to compute the following integrals @xmath93 and",
    "@xmath94    eq . can be rewritten as @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102    the poles @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are simple , so the a integral can be evaluated straightforwardly using residue theory .",
    "the remaining task now is to determine the location of the poles at given @xmath107 , and @xmath108 to see which contributes to the a integral .",
    "using identities such as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we have @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath112.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we generalize a to a complex variable , and use as our contour the real axis and the upper half - circle of infinite radius and counter - clockwise orientation .",
    "( note that one could use instead the lower half - circle , and our procedure still works ) .",
    "the contribution from integrating over the upper - half - circle perimeter vanishes since our integrand has the form @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are polynomials , and the degree of @xmath114 is less than that of @xmath115 by two .",
    "hence , each pole in the upper half plane would contribute @xmath116 times its residue to eq . .",
    "slight complication arises when the poles are on the real axis , in which case we will have to deform the contour to avoid the poles .",
    "however , the reality of the integral ensures that another pole enters the upper half plane simultaneously as another leaves it , so that our original recipe of each pole within the contour contributing @xmath117 remains valid .",
    "we now analyze the behavior of the poles as @xmath108 changes , given fixed @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are @xmath120 we can solve for where ( as a function of @xmath108 ) each pole crosses the real axis by setting any of the above to @xmath59 .",
    "the resultant condition is a quartic equation of the form @xmath121 to express the four roots of this equation in a more concise form , we first define the functions    @xmath122    with these , we further introduce @xmath123 now the four roots are given by @xmath124    in the galactic plane @xmath81 , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath125 , and can be easily factored .",
    "the four roots are @xmath126 ( twice ) , @xmath127 .",
    "hence , the gravitational field admits a particularly simple form in this case , as we alluded to earlier .",
    "when @xmath128 vanishes , eqs . to become undefined .",
    "this occurs when @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the first condition implies that @xmath131 , which means that the second condition becomes @xmath132 which implies @xmath133 . combining these conditions",
    ", we see that roots as given by eqs . to are ill - defined on the two lines @xmath131 , @xmath133 .",
    "note that the line corresponding to the minus sign connects the highest point ( @xmath134 ) and the rightmost tip ( @xmath135 ) of the caustic , while the other is its vertical reflection about the @xmath81 axis .    to solve for the roots on these two lines , we use the facts @xmath129 and @xmath130 to first simplify eq .",
    ", from which we can solve for the four roots : @xmath136 where @xmath137    among the four roots , only the real ones correspond to poles crossing the real - axis of the @xmath138-complex plane .",
    "it turns out that qualitative differences exist between the behavior of the poles within and outside the caustic , so we have to study these two cases separately . within the caustic ( boundary given by ) , all four roots are real ; outside , only two of the four roots are real .",
    "this difference has to do with why a kink in the gravitational field appears as we cross the boundary of the caustic ring , which we saw in the case of @xmath81 discussed earlier .      within the caustic , all four roots to the quartic equation",
    "are real , implying that the poles cross the real axis a total of four times .",
    "in particular , the pole @xmath103 would cross the real axis three times , while @xmath104 would only do so once .",
    "since only poles in the upper half plane contribute to the integral , we will have to partition our integral over @xmath108 into multiple regions accordingly , and evaluate each partition separately . while it is nontrivial to determine precisely which of the roots of the quartic equation correspond to which pole , operationally this information is not essential , as we can always just reorder the roots and use them appropriately .",
    "that is , we compute the four roots using eqs .  ( @xmath139 ) and rank them in increasing order , and relabel them as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 .",
    "the smallest root @xmath142 is the value of @xmath108 at which @xmath104 crosses the real axis ( at fixed @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , while the other three larger roots are when @xmath103 crosses the real axis .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath143 , both @xmath103 and @xmath104 are in the upper half plane , and they would contribute @xmath144 $ ] to the integral .",
    "as @xmath108 increases beyond @xmath142 , @xmath104 leaves the upper half and plane , and @xmath105 enters , while @xmath103 remains .",
    "hence , now @xmath103 and @xmath105 would contribute @xmath145 $ ] to the integral .",
    "this holds until @xmath146 , when @xmath103 also leaves the upper half plane and @xmath106 enters simultaneously , so now @xmath105 and @xmath106 contribute to the integral .",
    "when @xmath108 gets to @xmath147 , @xmath103 reenters while @xmath106 leaves . finally , @xmath103 leaves again for @xmath148 .",
    "summarizing , at given @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the poles that are in the upper half complex a plane as a function of @xmath108 are given by :    * @xmath149 * @xmath150 * @xmath151 * @xmath152 * @xmath153    note also our calculation allows for an arbitrary constant which can be fixed by taking the limit that the caustic tube shrinks to a line . in this limit",
    ", the caustic is an infinite line at @xmath154 , and the density of dark matter particles is proportional to @xmath155 . using gauss law",
    ", we can show that @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the radial unit vector pointing away from the origin ( recall that @xmath158 and @xmath56 point in opposite directions ) .",
    "hence , we have to add @xmath159 to our solution for @xmath160 and @xmath59 to @xmath161 . alternatively , we could obtain these constants from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath162 at @xmath81 ( and taking advantage of the rotational symmetry that emerges in this limit of vanishing cross section size ) .",
    "hence after integrating over @xmath138 , the integral @xmath160 ( inside caustic ) becomes    @xmath163    which can be integrated to yield @xmath164 this can be simplified further to @xmath165    meanwhile , the integral @xmath161 becomes @xmath166 which can be readily integrated to yield @xmath167 as before , this can be simplified further to @xmath168 note that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are respectively the real and imaginary part of the same quantity .",
    "this is expected since the gravitational field is conservative .",
    "outside the caustic tube , the quartic polynomial has two complex and two real solutions .",
    "only the real solutions correspond to poles crossing the real axis .",

    "as @xmath108 increases , first @xmath104 crosses the real axis and leaves the upper half complex plane while @xmath105 enters .",
    "after that @xmath103 also exits while @xmath106 enters simultaneously .",
