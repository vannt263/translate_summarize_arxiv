    "it is known that variation of the topological charge of the gauge field can take place by overcoming an effective potential barrier . at",
    "zero temperature the most efficient mechanism is tunneling via the bpst instanton @xcite . for finite temperatures",
    "the tunneling effect is associated with the caloron @xcite , which is a periodic instanton - type solution .",
    "recent developments and a corresponding list of references for the caloron can be found in reviews @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the periodic conditions was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was named the periodic instanton .",
    "it proved useful for applications related to multiparticle production and studies of the barion and lepton number violation in high energy collisions and early universe @xcite . at finite temperatures there",
    "exists another possibility for variation of the topological charge , when the field goes over the top of the effective barrier , which separates valleys with different topological charges . in this case the field should be provided with sufficient amount of energy , which is obtained from the temperature .",
    "the configuration of the field at the top of the barrier is described by the sphaleron solution , as is explained by klinkhamer and manton @xcite .",
    "thus , the instanton and caloron provide quantum tunneling through the barrier , whereas the sphaleron plays a role when temperature excitations , which are classical processes , are considered",
    ". however , in both these cases the probability of the transition is exponentially suppressed . for the instanton - caloron related processes it is suppressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coupling constant .",
    "if the temperature @xmath2 is not extremely high , the sphaleron related probability is also suppressed , this time by the boltzmann factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the sphaleron mass .",
    "this work addresses a question of whether it is possible to enhance the probability of the transition , which is accompanied by variation of the topological charge .",
    "the idea is to combine the tunneling mechanism with thermal excitations .",
    "assume that first the gauge field obtains ( say , from the temperature ) a fraction of energy that is needed to go over the top of the barrier , so that with this amount of energy a classical jump over the barrier remains impossible .",
    "however , the field can tunnel through the remaining part of the barrier",
    ". one can think that transition through this remaining part of the barrier may be more probable than penetration through the initial barrier , which takes place for instanton - related processes .",
    "we will see that indeed , this combined , excitation plus tunneling , mechanism proves effective .",
    "this mechanism is described with the help of a particular configuration of the gauge field , in which the action reaches its minimum provided the euclidean energy is fixed .",
    "correspondingly , the energy plays the role of a parameter , which makes it convenient to refer to this field configuration as the energon @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the action means that the energon describes a classical solution .",
    "we will discuss two points of view on the energon , looking at it either by fixing its energy , or the temperature .",
    "the former description may present interest for those applications , which take place in non - equilibrium states .",
    "the latter , which relies on the temperature , presumes that the equilibrium is attained .",
    "several properties of the energon match some of the properties of instanton , caloron , and sphaleron , though it remains distinctively different from other phenomena .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields of the energon are collinear , which is similar to the main property of the instanton , though a coefficient of proportionality between the fields for the energon is more sophisticated , it is a function of the euclidean time .",
    "the instanton and sphaleron can be considered as particular examples of the energon for specific values of energy .",
    "when energy is zero , the energon is reduced to the instanton .",
    "if , on the other hand , the energy equals the sphaleron mass , the energon becomes identical to the sphaleron solution proposed in ref .",
    "for negative euclidean energies the energon exhibits a periodic behavior , which is reminiscent of a similar property of the caloron . if , however , energy is positive , the energon shows no periodicity .",
    "the energon has nonzero topological numbers , exhibiting therefore a nontrivial topological structure . however , in difference with the instanton and caloron the topological charge and chern - simons number for the energon are not integers , which can be compared with a non - integer chern - simons number @xmath5 of the sphaleron .",
    "discussing these and other properties of the energon below we will see that it represents an interesting and useful phenomenon .",
    "consider the su(2 ) non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "let us compare the instanton and sphaleron configurations of the gauge field .",
    "the instanton solution for the potential @xmath6 and the field @xmath7 reads ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 here @xmath10 defines the size of the instanton , the conventional gauge is taken , and notation of the euclidean formulation is adopted in which @xmath11 are the space - time coordinates in which the indexes run over @xmath12 , while the isotopic indexes for the su((2 ) gauge group take on values @xmath13 .",
    "the self - dual and anti - self - dual thooft symbols @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined conventionally @xmath16 generically , the instanton is characterized by its size , location and orientation . to simplify notation only @xmath10",
    "is presented explicitly in eqs.([ains]),([ains ] ) , the instanton position is set at the origin , while its orientation is specified indirectly , through the choice of the thooft symbols .",
    "however , later on , see subsection [ positive ] , we will keep in mind that the instanton position and orientation are the free parameters .    considering the sphaleron configuration",
    "let us remember that the sphaleron was introduced by klinkhamer and manton @xcite as a self - consistent solution for interacting gauge and higgs fields in the context of the electroweak theory . later on it",
    "was argued by ostrovsky , carter and shuryak in @xcite that important properties of the sphaleron structure can be described using the pure gauge field , which is restricted by specific conditions .",
    "this structure possesses only the magnetic field and has a simple analytical form . at the same time it retains the main features of the sphaleron solution ,",
    "in particular its topological number ( chern - simons number ) @xmath5 is the same as in the sphaleron solution of @xcite .",
    "we will use the configuration found in @xcite calling it the cos - sphaleron ( an abbreviation from the names of the authors ) .",
    "the cos - sphaleron has the following form @xmath17 here @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are spacial components of coordinates @xmath11 , which comprise a 3-vector @xmath20 , @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is the following function @xcite @xmath23 in which @xmath10 denotes the size of the sphaleron . in order to see similarity between the instanton and sphaleron solutions",
    "let us apply to the sphaleron in eq.([asph ] ) the gauge transformation defined by the unitary matrix @xmath24 \\label{u}\\ ] ] in which @xmath25 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the potential ( [ asph ] ) and gauge transformation identified in ( [ u ] ) belong to a set of potentials defined in ( [ am ] ) and set of transformations ( [ ug ] ) . applying eqs .",
    "( [ alpha])-([h ] ) , in which @xmath26 and @xmath27 we rewrite the cos - sphaleron in the following form @xmath28 compare now the instanton and sphaleron by matching eq.([ains ] ) with ( [ asp ] ) .",
    "take the same size @xmath10 in both cases .",
    "clearly there are distinctions between the two configurations .",
    "the instanton in eq.([ains ] ) is obviously a time - dependent solution , while the sphaleron in eq.([asp ] ) is a static configuration .",
    "but one can spot a similarity as well . by taking the instanton solution at the moment of time @xmath29 one",
    "observes that its vector potential equals the potential of the sphaleron @xmath30 this implies that the magnetic fields of these two configurations at this moment of time are also equal @xmath31 consider energy @xmath32 of the gauge field in euclidean formulation @xmath33 here the dot - product refers to conventional scalar product of spacial coordinates of vectors , the electric field accounts for the kinetic energy @xmath34 , while magnetic field is responsible for the potential energy @xmath35 of the field .",
    "the latter is taken with the negative sign , which is specific for the euclidean formulation . to mark the euclidean formulation explicitly the upperscript @xmath36",
    "the same upperscript is applied below for such quantities as total energy , potential energy , lagrange function etc . if necessary to refer to the minkowski formulation , these quantities are either marked by the upperscript @xmath37 , or left without any upperscript , for example the potential energy for the minkowski formulation reads in this notation @xmath38 .",
    "consider behavior of the potential and kinetic energies as functions of the euclidean time @xmath39 for the instanton solution . from eqs.([finst]),([pot ] ) and ( [ k ] ) one finds @xmath40 one verifies validity of this result by calculating the action @xmath41 which reproduces the well known instanton action . for the initial moment of time one finds from eq.([uinst ] ) @xmath42 the last identity here follows from eq.([b = b ] ) , which matches the magnetic field of the instanton with that of sphaleron , and from the simple fact that an absolute value of the potential energy for the sphaleron equals its mass .",
    "remember that the sign minus in the left - hand sides of eqs.([uinst]),([msph ] ) is related to the euclidean formulation , in which the motion within the instanton configuration is classically allowed , and the potential energy in eq.([uinst ] ) represents a potential well shown in fig .",
    "the solid horizontal line in this figure indicates the energy level of the instanton configuration , which according to eq.([uinst ] ) equals zero .",
    "the solid curve shows the profile of the potential energy for the instanton versus the euclidean time .",
    "the minimum of this well is associated with the sphaleron configuration , which is static , has zero kinetic energy , and whose potential energy equals @xmath43 .    in the minkowski space instead of",
    "the potential well there exists an effective potential barrier @xmath44 . in that case",
    "the instanton solution describes tunneling through the barrier , whose probability is @xmath45 .",
    "the sphaleron configuration describes events that take place at the top of the effective barrier , with the sphaleron mass equaling the energy of the effective barrier at its top .",
    "if the gauge field has a finite temperature , which is below the sphaleron mass , @xmath46 , then the field can overcome the top of the barrier using thermal excitations , but a probability of this event is suppresses by the boltzmann factor @xmath3 .",
    "thus , to overcome the barrier the field can either tunnel through it , or jump over its top , as has been well known previously . consider the possibility of a new event , in which the gauge field first acquires some energy from the temperature presuming that this energy is below the top of the barrier , @xmath47 , and then tunnels through the potential barrier .",
    "the idea is that this ` combined ' mechanism can be more effective than either direct tunneling , or direct temperature excitation .    in terms of the euclidean formulation our purpose",
    "can be illustrated using fig .",
    "[ ras ] , which shows two important energy levels , @xmath48 for the instanton and @xmath49 for the sphaleron .",
    "consider the situation when the gauge field has an energy in between the two , @xmath50 .",
    "one such energy level is shown by the dotted horizontal line in fig .",
    "one can try to adjust the configuration of the field in such a way , as to make a transition from the region described by negative @xmath39 to the region of positive @xmath39 the most effective .",
    "a possible configuration of the field , if exists , differs from the instanton simply because @xmath51 , and therefore the potential energy of this configuration should be different from the potential energy of the instanton .",
    "the dotted curve in the figure shows a possible profile of the potential energy .",
    "we presume that this possible configuration has a scaling factor , and that by tuning this factor one can normalize the minimum of the potential curve for this configuration to make it equal to the minimum of the potential well for the instanton ( minus sphaleron mass ) .",
    "the proposed potential well , which is shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ ras ] , in the minkowsi formulation represents a potential barrier .",
    "the idea is to look for the configuration of the field , which provides the best possible chance ( at the given energy ) to overcome this effective barrier .",
    "if such configuration is found for any energy @xmath50 , it would inevitably include the instanton and sphaleron configurations .",
    "let us find a set of configurations for the gauge field , which interpolates between the instanton and sphaleron solutions presuming that the energy plays the role of a parameter .",
    "for simplicity in this subsection we restrict ourselves to a simplified variational approach , postponing a more rigorous treatment until the next subsection [ minimum - action ] .",
    "we can derive a possible useful form of the variational configuration from eqs .",
    "( [ ains]),(([asp ] ) , which describe the instanton and sphaleron solutions .",
    "introduce first @xmath52 , @xmath53 which is defined with the help of a function @xmath54 ( remember @xmath55 ) that should be found from a variational procedure formulated below .",
    "define then the following potential @xmath56 where @xmath57 . calculating the field @xmath58 , which corresponds to this potential one observes that it has a simple appealing form @xmath59 here the modified @xmath60-symbol is defined",
    "as follows @xmath61 for an arbitrary function @xmath62 the modified symbol @xmath63 differs from @xmath14 , in particular it is not self - dual . if , however , @xmath64 then @xmath65 , similarly , @xmath66 leads to @xmath67 , which makes the field selfdual or anti - selfdual correspondingly .",
    "the field configuration described by eqs.([aam])-([heta ] ) exhibits similarities with the instanton solution from eqs.([ains])-([eta ] ) .",
    "in particular , eq.([f]),([heta ] ) show that its magnetic field equals magnetic field of the instanton , while its electric field differs from the instanton field by only a factor @xmath68 note though that the fields of the energon and instanton in these relations are taken at different values of euclidean time , which equals @xmath39 for the energon and @xmath62 for the instanton . since electric and magnetic fields of the instanton",
    "coincide , @xmath69 , eqs.([bb]),([ee ] ) imply an interesting relation between the fields for the configuration defined by eqs.([aam])-([heta ] ) @xmath70 using eq.([f ] ) one finds the density of the kinetic @xmath71 and potential @xmath72 energies @xmath73 integrating , one derives the kinetic and potential energies themselves @xmath74 let us find now the function @xmath62 that provides a minimum for the classical action @xmath75 .",
    "this minimum is important for us since in minkowski picture it governs the probability of the tunneling through an effective potential barrier , see eq.([we ] ) below .",
    "specify first the lagrange function of our system @xmath76 clearly , we can consider @xmath77 here as an effective coordinate within the lagrange formalism , and @xmath78 as a corresponding effective velocity . realizing this",
    ", we can formulate and resolve the lagrange equation for @xmath62 , finding hence the desired minimum for the action .",
    "since we have only one function to specify , we can simplify our task by resolving from the very beginning the energy conservation law .",
    "introduce the effective momentum @xmath79 , which in the lagrange formalism reads @xmath80 then derive the effective hamiltonian @xmath81 , which corresponds to the given lagrange function @xmath82 observe now that this _ effective _ hamiltonian can be identified with the energy of the gauge field @xmath83 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined in ( [ kk ] ) and ( [ uu ] ) .",
    "this equality is not self - evident , for an arbitrary parametrization of the potential of the gauge field it does not hold .",
    "the fact that it is satisfied supports the soundness of the parametrization of the potentials chosen in eqs.([aam]),([aa4 ] ) and makes arguments relying on the energy conservation law reliable .",
    "( reasons explaining why the chosen parametrization of the potentials proves successful become clear in the next subsection , which argues that this potential provides a local minimum for the action . )    stating the energy conservation law , @xmath84 , where @xmath32 is a constant , one finds from eq.([h ] ) @xmath85 here the sign depends on a choice of initial conditions . in what follows",
    "we will usually presume the sign plus . substituting ( [ dqdt ] ) in eq.([p ] ) one expresses the momentum @xmath79 as a function of the coordinate @xmath77 , which is necessary for calculation of the action , see ( [ s ] ) below . integrating eq.([dqdt ] ) we derive @xmath86 here @xmath78 is a function of @xmath77 defined in ( [ dqdt ] ) , which makes the right - hand side a function of @xmath77 . resolving this function",
    "one finds @xmath62 explicitly .",
    "consequently , eq.([tq ] ) completely specifies the configuration of fields in eqs.([aam]),([aa4 ] ) .",
    "we see that this configuration depends on two parameters , one being the scaling factor @xmath10 , which is similar to the scaling factor in the instanton and sphaleron solutions .",
    "the other is the euclidean energy , which according to eq.([dqdt ] ) takes on the values in the interval @xmath87 .",
    "clearly , for nonpositive energies @xmath88 @xmath62 as a function of @xmath39 exhibits oscillations , whose properties are studied in some detail below , see section [ negative ] . for positive energies ,",
    "@xmath89 the energon behaves differently . in that case a variation of @xmath39 in some finite region @xmath90 is accompanied by a corresponding monotonic variation of @xmath62 from @xmath91 to @xmath92 . as a result",
    "the energon exhibits a phenomenon of localization in the finite region of @xmath39 , see discussion in section [ positive ] .",
    "consider eq.([aam ] ) for the case when @xmath93 .",
    "then eqs.([dqdt]),([tq ] ) show that @xmath94 , eq.([z ] ) gives @xmath95 .",
    "consequently , eqs.([aam]),([aa4 ] ) are reduced to the instanton form ( [ ains ] ) .",
    "this means that the instanton solution presents a particular example of the energon configuration , in which energy equals zero .",
    "equation ( [ eb ] ) complies with this conclusion .",
    "it shows that if @xmath96 , then electric and magnetic fields are equal , precisely what happens for the instanton solution .",
    "take now the limit @xmath97 , where the sphaleron mass is defined in ( [ msph ] ) .",
    "then according to eq.([dqdt ] ) we have @xmath98 , and eqs.([kk]),([uu ] ) give @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus , properties of the energon with @xmath101 are similar to the sphaleron configuration .",
    "equation ( [ eb ] ) supports this conclusion .",
    "it shows that for @xmath102 the electric field does not play a role , while the magnetic field of the energon equals the field of sphaleron , as evident from eqs.([b = b]),([bb ] ) for @xmath103 .",
    "we see that the instanton and sphaleron can be considered as particular examples of the energon configuration .",
    "consider the classical action and the energy of the gauge field @xmath104 the signs in front of the terms @xmath105 here comply with the euclidean formulation .",
    "using conventional cauchy s inequality we can write @xmath106 equations ( [ ene ] ) and ( [ cauchy ] ) allow one to estimate the action . note",

    "the latter takes place when @xmath109 since the integrals in eq.([cauchy ] ) run only over spatial coordinates @xmath110 , the coefficient in eq.([ekb ] ) is allowed to be an arbitrary ( real - valued ) function of @xmath39 , @xmath111 .",
    "equations ( [ estac]),([ekb ] ) show that if the energy of the gauge field @xmath32 is fixed , then one can search for a minimum of the action using condition ( [ ekb ] ) .",
    "the point is that eq .",
    "( [ ekb ] ) represents a non - linear differential equation for the 4-potential of the gauge field . generally speaking",
    ", it may have presented a formidable problem .",
    "however , our previous discussion shows that the solution of this problem exists , eq.([ekb ] ) can be resolved .",
    "compare ( [ ekb ] ) with eq.([eb ] ) .",
    "see that these equations differ only by the name of a coefficient in them , so that changing @xmath112 in ( [ ekb ] ) , into @xmath113 , @xmath114 , one reduces ( [ ekb ] ) to ( [ eb ] ) .",
    "remember that the later equality was derived from the potential in ( [ aam ] ) .",
    "we see that the potential ( [ aam ] ) gives a solution of ( [ ekb ] ) .",
    "this implies that the potential ( [ aam ] ) guarantees an equality in eq.([estac ] ) .",
    "note a simple important point .",
    "our search for a minimum of the action resulted in the particular potential ( [ estac ] ) , which depends only on one function @xmath62 , so that if we minimize the action further by adjusting this function , we accurately represent the minimum . from the potential eq.([aam ] ) one derives the field ( [ f ] ) and calculates the spatial integral in eq.([estac ] ) ( remember this is an equality now ) .",
    "the result has a form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the familiar lagrange function , which was introduced in the previous subsection in eq.([l ] ) .",
    "after that one minimizes the action in ( [ sl ] ) by choosing the function @xmath62 appropriately . recall that precisely this procedure was undertaken in the previous subsection [ energ ] with the same lagrange function , see eqs.([l])-([dqdt ] ) .",
    "therefore we can state again that the function @xmath62 is defined by eq.([tq ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the local minimum of the action , which is restricted by a given value of energy , is provided by the potential ( [ aam ] ) , in which @xmath62 is specified in eq.([tq ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to present this result in terms of the modified action , which takes into account the energy related restriction explicitly .",
    "this can be achieved by using the conventional method of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "remember that along with the energy @xmath32 we also need to fix the size @xmath10 for the energon , which can be achieved if we introduce the following condition @xmath117 where @xmath35 is the potential energy defined in eq.([pot ] ) . adding a linear combination @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the lagrange multipliers , to the action @xmath121 in ( [ act ] ) we present the resulting modified action in the following form @xmath122 here restrictions posed by the fixed values of energy and scaling factor prompt a subscript ` res ' in the action , and the functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 include the terms from the original action in ( [ act ] ) as well as the lagrange multipliers , @xmath125 , @xmath126 . generally speaking , these functions should be derived from a complete minimizing procedure , but one can find without calculations that they are @xmath127 to verify this identity remember the similarity between the potentials for the energon ( [ aam ] ) and instanton ( [ ains ] ) , which also manifests itself for their fields in eqs . ( [ bb]),([ee ] ) .",
    "basing on this resemblance one finds that the action for the energon can be derived from the conventional action for the gauge field in eq.([act ] ) using the following transformations in the action s integrand @xmath128 these changes reproduce definitions in eq.([em ] ) thus justifying the later identity .",
    "alternatively , ( [ em ] ) can be verified by writing the classical equations of motion that follow from it and comparing the result with eqs.([bb]),([ee ] ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath123 and @xmath129 play a role , which is similar to the dielectric constant and permeability in conventional electrodynamics .",
    "we learn from this discussion that the energon is characterized by two important properties .",
    "firstly , it can be considered as a classical solution , in which euclidean energy is fixed .",
    "secondly , it can be viewed as a configuration , in which the electric and magnetic fields are collinear and the ratio of these fields is a nontrivial function of the euclidean time .",
    "each of these two properties that the energon is not a selfdual configuration . to clarify this point let us take into account that the magnetic and electric fields of any selfdual solution are necessarily equal ( their equality gives another representation of the selfdual condition ) .",
    "consequently , the kinetic energy , which is expressed via the electric field , and the euclidean potential energy , which is derived from the magnetic field , are necessarily identical in magnitude and opposite in sign for any selfdual configuration .",
    "this makes the total energy of any selfdual solution zero .",
    "thus , a selfdual solution is characterized by equal electric and magnetic fields and zero energy , in contrast to the energon which has dissimilar fields and nonzero energy .",
    "this discussion underlines the fact that the energon differs from any selfdual solution , including the instanton and caloron .",
    "to describe behavior of the energon at an arbitrary negative energy @xmath130 we calculate @xmath131 numerically from eq.([tq ] ) , and then evaluate the potential energy from eq .",
    "( [ uu ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "each curve in this figure represents a profile of the euclidean potential energy @xmath132 as a function of the euclidean time @xmath39 for a fixed euclidean energy @xmath133 .",
    "a set of energy levels is shown by horizontal lines , each such line touches the corresponding potential curve .",
    "observe that the potential curves are different for different energy levels @xmath133 , as one would expect .",
    "however , if we keep the size - factor @xmath10 same , the potential curves for different energies have the same minimum @xmath134 . for each energy level",
    "the potential energy represents a potential well .",
    "hence , the system considered oscillates in this well .",
    "the period of oscillations is finite for all negative energies , while in the limit @xmath135 the period diverges ( see eq .",

    "as we know , the limit @xmath139 implies that @xmath98 .",

    "the found properties of energon at low negative energies , @xmath153 , can be compared with the results of khlebnikov , rubakov , and tinyakov @xcite .",
    "these authors developed an approach , calling it ` periodic instantons ' , which is based on the idea that a classical solution can be approximated by a function periodic in @xmath39 that describes a chain of instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "the energon complies with this idea in the energy region considered , as evident from the discussion above , see the energy level shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "however , generically the energon is defined for a wide range of energies where it reveals very different properties , which may strongly deviate from the simple bpst instanton . to illustrate this point , recall the solutions that correspond to the energy levels at the bottom of the potential well in fig .",

    "the above description of @xmath62 is valid only within the interval @xmath163 where the function @xmath62 is finite and allows one to define the energon . at the boundaries , @xmath164 , this function diverges ,",
    "@xmath165 . as a result",
    "both electric and magnetic fields are decreasing here , @xmath166 .",
    "thus the energon as a function of @xmath39 is well localized within the interval @xmath167 .",
    "this property will be called the ` localization ' of the energon .",
    "the definition for the energon can be extended beyond the interval @xmath167 , but such extension is not uniquely defined and incorporates an interesting structure .",
    "cover the entire axis @xmath168 by a set of finite intervals of time @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "presume then that in each given interval there exists an energon solution .",
    "we discussed above how to construct this solution for the interval @xmath167 .",
    "similar approach is valid for any other interval @xmath169 .",
    "one takes the lower limit in the integral in eq.([tq ] ) as @xmath172 thus specifying @xmath62 in the interval @xmath169 , and then defines the energon using eqs.([aam]),([aa4 ] ) .",
    "the point is that one can use an arbitrary instanton solution in eqs.([aam]),([aa4 ] ) .",
    "this means that the instanton orientation , size , and location , which are essential parameters there , may be taken differently in different intervals @xmath169 .",
    "the opportunity for this divergence is related to the localization of the energon , which implies that what happens with the energon solution in the interval @xmath169 does not interfere with the solution defined in any other interval @xmath173 because on the boundaries @xmath172 between the intervals the fields of the energon are all zero .",
    "there is one restriction in this construction though .",
    "clearly , the substitution @xmath174 makes eq.([t0 ] ) applicable to any interval @xmath169 .",
    "the resulting equation shows that the length @xmath175 of the interval @xmath169 is defined by the size of the instanton chosen for this interval . in other words",
    "the lengths of all intervals that cover the axis @xmath39 and the sizes of instantons used in ( [ aam]),([aa4 ] ) for each interval are interrelated . however , apart from this restriction all other instanton parameters in this construction are arbitrary .",
    "we see that on the axis @xmath168 the energon exhibits a rich structure governed by an infinite number of parameters that describe different instantons used to define the energon in different intervals of @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , even if all these parameters are set equal , there still remains a freedom to choose the sign in eq.([dqdt ] ) , which may be taken differently in different intervals of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , on the axis @xmath176 there exists an infinite variety of energon solutions .",
    "in particular , there is an option to construct solutions periodic in @xmath39 , but they represent only a small fraction of all available opportunities .",
    "generically the energons defined by this procedure do not show periodicity .",
    "we learn from this discussion that the energon behaves very differently for different areas of energy .",
    "it is a uniquely defined periodic function of @xmath39 for negative energies .",
    "in contrast , for positive energies the energon exhibits a phenomenon of the localization , which implies that it can be well described within a finite interval of @xmath39 .",
    "alternatively , the energon can be defined on the whole axis @xmath39 , but the localization makes this definition dependent on an infinite set of parameters .",
    "for negative energies the energon configuration interpolates between the instanton and sphaleron .",
    "since these two later solutions are both topologically nontrivial , one has to expect that the energon possesses nontrivial topological properties as well .",
    "consider the topological current @xmath177 ( the signs comply with the euclidean formulation . )",
    "the divergence of this current equals the density of the topological charge @xmath178 for the energon configuration ( [ aam])-([f ] ) we find the topological current @xmath179 and the corresponding density of the topological charge @xmath180 topological properties of the gauge field are closely related to the chern - simons number , which , up to a gauge transformation , equals the integral of the charge density of the topological current @xmath181 here the maurer cartan form ( winding number ) @xmath182 takes into account the fact that the topological current is not invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "correspondingly the chern - simons number is also not invariant , its variation is given in eqs.([cs]),([cm ] ) . using eq.([etc ] )",
    "we find for the energon that the first term in ( [ nnu ] ) reads @xmath183 to assess the second term @xmath182 in eq.([nnu ] ) , we have to remember that the vector potential in eq.([aam ] ) exhibits a long tail @xmath184 at @xmath185 , which poses a problem . to eliminated it one has to choose the gauge appropriately . with this purpose",
    "let us make the gauge transformation defined by eq.([ug ] ) , in which @xmath186 .",
    "taking into account eqs.([am]),([alpha])-([h ] ) one verifies that in order to keep the potentials regular at the origin and at the same time eliminate the tail @xmath184 at infinity , it suffices to have @xmath187 presuming that @xmath188 rapidly converges to its limiting value @xmath189 when @xmath185 . according to eq.([1/2 ] )",
    "condition ( [ 0infty ] ) implies that @xmath190 . combining this result with eqs.([cs ] ) and ( [ nnu ] ) we derive the following expression for the chern - simons number @xmath191",

    "hence , the chern - simons number as a function of @xmath39 satisfies @xmath194 which implies @xmath195 an additional insight into the properties of this function comes from a general relation between the chern - simons number and an integral over the density of the topological charge",

    "alternatively , one can use it to derive anew eq.([n ] ) .",
    "( though in this case one needs first to justify ( [ n12 ] ) independently .",

    "it is instructive to introduce the maximum and minimum of the chern - simons number , @xmath198 , which are achieved when @xmath77 in eq.([n ] ) takes on the values @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively ( remember @xmath150 is a maximum of @xmath62 defined by condition @xmath201 , where @xmath78 is given in eq.([dqdt ] ) ) .",

    "it also complies with the previous calculations presented in fig .",

    "when calculating this derivative via eq.([s ] ) one needs to calculate the derivative of @xmath79 over energy , which according to eqs.([p]),([dqdt ] ) equals @xmath232 using this fact we find from eq.([s ] ) @xmath233 here the half - period @xmath148 describes the time interval during which @xmath62 goes from @xmath213 to @xmath150 . eq.([t1",

    "the results shown by the solid line in fig .",

    "[ pat ] . with increase of temperature",
    "the energy increases as well . the highest temperature for which eq.([tau12 ] )",
    "admits solution is defined by the smallest possible half - period , which according to eq.([1.99 ] ) equals @xmath236 .",
    "this value restricts the highest temperature @xmath237 .",
    "the absence of solutions of eq.([tau12 ] ) for higher temperatures indicates that the direct process , in which the field acquires enough energy from the temperature to overcome the top of the barrier , presents the most efficient mechanism .",
    "thus at @xmath238 the conventional cos sphaleron presents the most plausible opportunity for overcoming the barrier .",
    "figure [ west ] shows the behavior of the energon action @xmath229 in eq.([wt ] ) .",
    "remember , the energon is a combined process , which uses both the tunneling mechanism and thermal excitations to overcome the barrier .",
    "figure [ west ] compares it with two well known pure processes .",
    "one of them is the instanton , which represents the tunneling process and is governed by the tunneling exponent @xmath239 . the solid line in fig",
    ". [ west ] shows that @xmath229 is always smaller than @xmath240 , thus indicating that at any finite temperature the energon is a more probable process than the pure tunneling .",
    "however , at low temperatures the difference between @xmath229 and @xmath240 is small , the solid curve converges to unity . with the increase of temperature",
    "this distinction becomes more prominent .",
    "the tunneling action for the caloron configuration equals @xmath241 @xcite , which is similar to the instanton action .",
    "the difference is that the coupling constant for the caloron depends on the temperature .",
    "however , this dependence is of a conventional logarithmic nature .",
    "therefore it results only in a preexponential factor .",
    "the latter is important for detailed calculations , but if we are content with an exponential estimate , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ west ] , then the caloron and instanton give a similar contribution to the tunneling probability .",
    "a dashed curve in fig . [ west ] presents a ratio @xmath242 , which compares a capability of the energon to overcome the barrier with the sphaleron , i. e. direct boltzmann excitations over the top of the barrier ( given by the sphaleron mass @xmath243 ) . at low temperatures",
    "the energon is more efficient , the mentioned ratio being smaller than 1 . with an increase of temperature",
    "the distinction becomes less prominent and eventually disappears at @xmath244 , where the dashed curve reaches unity .",
    "above this temperature the mechanism related to sphaleron , i. e. direct boltzmann excitations , is the dominant process .    observe a region in the vicinity of @xmath245 , which is distinguished by arrows in fig .",
    "here the energon - based tunneling process prevails over both the instanton and sphaleron based mechanisms . at this temperature",
    "the tunneling action for instanton , @xmath240 , equals the factor @xmath246 , which governs the boltzmann excitations .",
    "the energon action @xmath229 at this point represents @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) of @xmath249 .",
    "reduction of the large tunneling action @xmath240 by @xmath250 indicates an enhancement for the processes accociated with the energon , which is described by a large exponential factor @xmath251 take , for example , the electro - weak theory .",
    "then the instanton action is very large , @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "this fact makes the instanton tunneling process strongly forbidden , though , as thooft mentioned @xcite , it presents interest since it results in the barion non - conservation .",
    "equation ( [ ken ] ) shows that the enhancement to the tunneling process at finite temperatures due to the energon can be as large as @xmath254 , which is a huge boost , though the remaining @xmath255 of the action still represents a formidable suppression . for qcd processes the enhancement provided by",
    "the energon is less dramatic , but the instanton is a more probable phenomenon there .",
    "we discussed a family of configurations of the yang - mills field , referring to it as the energon , which exhibits several interesting properties .",
    "it can be defined via the minimum of the classical action , and hence it is a solution of classical equations of motion , albeit this minimum and the corresponding equations are taken with restrictions , which state that the euclidean energy and size of the energon are presumed fixed and play the role of parameters . another way to define",
    "the energon is through a relation between its electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these fields are collinear , and their ratio is a function of the euclidean time , which is specified by the energy conservation law . the instanton and cos - sphaleron prove to be particular examples of the energon .",
    "they appear when the energon energy takes on specific values , i. e. zero and ( minus ) sphaleron mass for the instanton and sphaleron respectively .",
    "the energon possesses nonzero chern - simons number .",
    "due to this reason in minkowsky space it can be considered as a process , which provides transition through the effective barrier , which separates valleys with different topological numbers .",
    "we found that for temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath256 , the energon strongly , exponentially enhances the probability of this transition .",
    "several problems arise for further consideration .",
    "the energon was derived here by a deformation of the single - instanton solution .",
    "it seems plausible that multi - instanton solutions can also be deformed in a similar way , leading to multi - energon configurations .",
    "if this anticipation proves true , the result may shed new light on the properties of multi - sphaleron configurations .",
    "an important issue is the interaction of the energon with other fields , fermions and scalars .",
    "it is known that the instanton interacts with them very strongly , revealing nontrivial features related to the anomaly @xcite .",
    "the sphaleron also shows very strong interaction with other fields @xcite .",
    "it is inevitable therefore that the energon should interact with other fields strongly .",
    "this problem is directly related to possible practical applications , in which one has to specify whether the energon takes place in the higgs phase of , for example , electroweak theory , or in the confining phase , as for the case of qcd .",
    "the interaction of the energon with external fields in these phases may lead to different results .",
    "a related issue presents connection between the energon and sphaleron solution of @xcite .",
    "this particular sphaleron incorporates self - consistently strong interaction of the gauge and higgs fields . therefore in order to search for a possible connection between the energon and the sphaleron of @xcite one has to establish how the energon interacts with the scalar field .",
