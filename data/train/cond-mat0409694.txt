    "large-@xmath1 methods and slave bosons are useful for the study of the effect of charge fluctuations on various electronic properties as they can be included at @xmath11 , however , spin fluctuations are typically neglected unless complicated @xmath12 contributions are considered . the effect of spin fluctuations on superconductivity in quarter - filled systems has been addressed through rpa ( random phase approximation ) calculations which consider antiferromagnetic instabilities induced by the on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath8 [ ] , finding that @xmath10 superconductivity still prevails .",
    "however , well in the charge ordered insulating phase it is known that the spins order antiferromagnetically due to the presence of a next - nearest neighbor spin exchange interaction@xcite .",
