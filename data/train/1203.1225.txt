    "while the standard picture of the hierarchical build - up of large - scale structure in the universe has been supported by ever increasing observational evidence , it is still an ongoing task to understand thoroughly the detailed baryonic physics associated with galaxy formation , such as gas accretion , star formation and feedback .",
    "direct observation of these gaseous processes is challenging . on the other hand ,",
    "given the large galaxy samples currently available to us , such as sdss dr7 @xcite , statistical analysis of galaxy properties has proved to be invaluable to probe the underlying physics affecting galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the morphology - density correlation for galaxies , uncovered already in the 1930s @xcite , shows a clear segregation , with early - type galaxies preferentially existing in high density regions @xcite .",
    "further investigation has indicated that it is the star - formation related properties , such as color and emission - line flux , that are more directly correlated with environmental density @xcite . at fixed color ,",
    "the residual dependence of morphology on the environmental density is rather weak @xcite .",
    "it is also emphasized by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , that the environment dependence is in fact quite local .",
    "while galaxies with abundant close neighbors have clearly different properties from those of isolated galaxies , on scales larger than @xmath10 , environmental effects probably have little influence on galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it has long been known from extensions of press - schecter theory that massive halos preferentially reside in dense environments @xcite .",
    "galaxies therein have properties that are different from those in small halos . on the other hand ,",
    "the excursion set theory with sharp - k filter and with dynamics described by the spherical collapse model predicts that the formation history of halos of fixed mass should depend only on smaller - scale structure not on their large - scale environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "incorporating the ellipsoidal collapse model into excursion set theory gives halo mass functions and bias in better agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in its simple version , however , the theory takes into account the ellipsoidal collapse by considering the average tidal field , and thus also predicts no correlations between the formation history of halos and their specific large - scale environment @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations show that halo properties can be strongly correlated with their environment .",
    "halo assembly bias reveals that old halos tend to cluster more strongly than their younger counterparts , and this bias is particularly significant for low mass halos @xcite . using filters other than the sharp - k filter in the excursion set theory leads to non - markovian random walks , which in turn generate correlations between halo formation history and large - scale environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite shows that under the spherical collapse model , the correlations arising purely from this non - markovianity are expected to be stronger for more massive halos , in disagreement with the trend seen in simulations .",
    "taking into account ellipsoidal collapse and the effects of large - scale environment on halo formation statistically @xcite and dynamically @xcite , the age dependent assembly bias can naturally arise and be more apparent for less massive halos .",
    "it is also noted by @xcite that environmental density plays the determining role in the virialization redshift of halos , and that the morphology of large - scale structure contributes mostly to its scatter .",
    "however , given a fixed halo mass , the analytical model of @xcite predicts that the median formation redshift of halos decreases with increasing environmental density , defined as the linear density fluctuation smoothed over @xmath11 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the results from simulations .",
    "@xcite emphasize that for galactic - scale halos of fixed mass , an early formation epoch is closely related to a reduced mass - growth rate at late times that is mainly due to the tidal effects of neighboring massive halos .",
    "as galactic halos are enhanced in filaments near massive halos , the dependence of their formation epoch on environmental density is expected ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for cluster - scaled halos , however ,",
    "@xcite show that tidal effects from large - scale structure can not play an important role in the environment dependence of formation history .",
    "gas physics allows more complicated interactions between galaxies and their environment .",
    "galaxies are more subject to ram pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and shock heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in denser regions .",
    "both the cooling efficiency and the gas compression rate are directly related to environmental density .",
    "it has been observed in hydrodynamical simulations that most cold flows are highly anisotropic and follow dark matter filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use sdss dr7 data to examine the dependence of galaxy properties on their large - scale environment .",
    "we focus on the influence of the morphology of environment over and above the well - known dependence on environment density .",
    "this analysis may provide important constraints on the theories and hypotheses discussed above .",
    "it can also help clarify if large - scale environment should be included in the halo occupation distribution model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe our measurements of large - scale tidal field with sdss dr7 . in section 3 , we present our results .",

    "these definitions can show clearly the filament - node nature of large - scale structure at least in a two - dimensional cut .",
    "however , this classification is highly degenerate with a classification by density . as shown in the left panel of figure 1 , the overdensity distributions of points in these different categories are very different , and thus the dependence of galaxy properties on such `` tidal environments '' may mainly reflect a density dependence . to address the dependence of galaxy properties on tidal properties other than overdensity , we here describe the tidal environment of galaxies with parameters describing ellipticity @xmath0 and prolateness @xmath50 . specifically , we define @xmath0 and @xmath50 as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",

    "by introducing the additional parameter @xmath0 , however , these two regions can be separated clearly .",
    "the main purpose of our study is to investigate if galaxy properties depend on the morphology of their large - scale environment in addition to the known density dependence . to do that",

    "previous studies have shown that galaxy properties are influenced by their environmental densities mainly locally @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if we simply smooth the environments on a scale larger than expected for any physical impact , we may still see an apparent environment - density dependence which arises merely due to the correlation between the environmental density on the considered smoothing scale and that on the scale where environmental effects are the strongest .",

    "we note that while the tidal interactions of dark matter halos are naturally accounted for in the sam , tidal disruption of galaxies is not . for massive clusters ,",
    "however , it is expected that their strong tidal forces may destroy galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as those satellite galaxies are mostly red , such disruptions can decrease the level of clustering of red galaxies , and therefore reduce the discrepancies in color - density relation between the sam and the observations in high density regions .",
    "further , this can also alleviate the overly - fast - growth problem for central galaxies in the sam @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that hot gas in satellite galaxies may not be immediately stripped away by ram pressure when they merge into a larger system as often assumed in sams .",

    "the black lines here represent results from the mock catalogue , and will be discussed in  4.3 .",
    "the three panels correspond to the smoothing with @xmath78 , with the @xmath88-nearest - neighbor distance , and with the @xmath117 .",
    "it is seen that the contour behaviors are qualitatively similar to those of figure 4 for the sdss . in the sam",
    ", the distance to the @xmath88-nearest neighbor also corresponds to the peak scale of the color - density dependence , at which , the tidal @xmath0-dependence of galaxy properties is nearly null .",
    "the density @xmath97 at the optimal adaptive smoothing scale plays the dominant role for the environmental effects .",
    "the weak negative / positive @xmath32-@xmath0 correlations at smaller / larger smoothing scales again reflect correlations between @xmath94 at the smoothing scale and @xmath97 .",
    "a notable difference between figure 9 and figure 4 is the density dependence of color , which is significantly stronger in figure 9 than that shown in figure 4 .",
    "this is consistent with the result shown in figure 8 , which also show that the sam predicts a considerable stronger color - density correlation than seen in observations .      to make a realistic comparison between the results for the sam and the sdss ,",
    "different observational effects must be taken into account .",
    "we thus build mock catalogs from the sam data following @xcite .",
    "we first test the influence of fiber collisions which reduce the number of redshift measurements for galaxies in close pairs by about @xmath118 .",
    "because our smoothing scale is nearly always larger than @xmath119 , fiber collisions do not affect our analysis significantly .",
    "the most notable influences from obervations are the redshift distortion effect and the effect from the survey geometry .",
    "the redshift - space distortion affects mainly the high density regions and plays a role of `` mixing '' . in redshift space ,",
    "galaxies in massive clusters present a finger - of - god configuration along the line of sight . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies in filaments surrounding a massive cluster have a tendency to be flowing into the cluster , which squashes the filaments along the line of sight .",
    "in other words , galaxies in filaments and galaxies in massive clusters are somewhat mixed in redshift space .",
    "thus the color scatter in a given density bin becomes larger in redshift space , resulting in a lower color - density correlation coefficient in high density regions , as shown by the green solid line in figure 8 .",
    "furthermore , the redshift - space distortion makes the measured environmental density systematically lower than that measured in real space .",
    "the ellipticity calculated in the redshift space is systematically lower / higher for regions with high / low @xmath0 in real space .",
    "that is , filaments become rounder and clusters tend to be more anisotropic in redshift space . such effects cause color mixing in the @xmath120 $ ] plane , and thus lead to flatter color contours with respect to the ellipticity @xmath0 and weaker correlations with @xmath42 ( see the black contour lines in figure 9 ) .    in low density regions , measurements of environmental density and ellipticity",
    "are mainly affected by survey geometry .",
    "both are biased to lower values . in the left panel of figure 10 , we show the value of @xmath0 with respect to the distance to the survey boundary for sdss sample @xmath2420 .",
    "different lines represent different environmental density ranges with longer dashes corresponding to higher densities .",
    "physically , we do not expect any correlations between @xmath0 value and the distance to the survey boundary . for high - density lines , they are indeed nearly flat . for low - density lines , however , the measured @xmath0 is systematically lower for galaxies closer to the survey boundary .",
    "the effect is significant for galaxies that are within @xmath121 of the boundary .",
    "this is clearly an observational effect due to padding the regions outside the survey boundary with the average number density .",
    "such a measurement bias on @xmath0 can lead to artificial correlations between galaxy properties and environmental ellipticity .",
    "the significance of the effect depends on the the fraction of galaxies that are within @xmath121 of the boundary .",
    "volume - limited samples with smaller volume are affected more . in the right panel of figure 10",
    ", we show the ratio of color in high @xmath0 regions to the color in low @xmath0 regions vs. minus the absolute magnitude of galaxies -@xmath24 . here",
    "high and low @xmath0 are defined as above the @xmath122 level and below the @xmath123 level with respect to the average @xmath0 ( see the right panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "we present results for different sdss volume - limited samples , @xmath2418 , @xmath2419 and @xmath2420 from smaller to larger volume .",
    "for @xmath2418 , we see the decrease of the color ratio with respect to -@xmath24 of galaxies .",
    "that is , for relatively faint galaxies , the ones in low @xmath0 regions tend to be bluer than those in high @xmath0 regions . for bright galaxies ,",
    "the ratio is close to @xmath124 . for @xmath2419 and @xmath2420",
    ", there is no detectable dependence of the color ratio on -@xmath24 , and the ratio is always close to @xmath124 . to test",
    "if the @xmath24-dependence of the color ratio seen in @xmath2418 is physical or due to the boundary effect , we construct subsamples of galaxies with distances less than @xmath125 from @xmath2419 and @xmath2420 , respectively . this cut corresponds roughly to the distance limit of @xmath2418 .",
    "the results for the @xmath2419 and @xmath2420 subsamples are shown by unfilled green triangles and unfilled red squares , respectively . the apparent correlation with @xmath24 of galaxies",
    "is then seen .",
    "this demonstrates that the correlation seen for @xmath2418 sample is largely due to the boundary effect . as shown in the left panel of figure 10 , in low density regions , the @xmath0 value is biased to a lower value for galaxies closer to the survey boundary . because galaxies in low density regions tend to be bluer than those in high density regions , this bias leads to an increase in the number of relatively blue galaxies in low @xmath0 regions , and thus increases the color ratio between high @xmath0 and low @xmath0 regions .",
    "the increase of the color ratio is more significant for fainter galaxies because the observed ones reside in a smaller volume around the observer and thus suffer more from the boundary effect .    in figure 11",

    "therefore our results are in agreement with theirs concerning the dominant importance of the nearby environment .",

    "our results are also in accordance with the theoretical study of @xcite , which showed that environmental effects on dark matter halo formation mainly reflect environmental density , and are influenced little by @xmath0 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite found that the anti - correlation between the formation epoch of galactic halos and their environment density is , in fact , mainly attributable to tidal suppression by neighboring massive halos . because of the enhanced environment density near massive halos , this suppression shows up as an assembly bias , and provides a possible explanation for galaxy variation with environment density . on the other hand , @xcite chose the smallest eigenvalue @xmath140 of the tidal tensor as an indicator of the strength of tidal field , and they found a stronger dependence of halo formation epoch on @xmath140 than on environment density .",
    "our results manifest a strong degeneracy between @xmath140 and environment density . just as for ellipticity , @xmath140 can be geometrically more strongly correlated with environment density on the optimal smoothing scale than on a larger scale .",

    "redshift - space distortion is significant in high density regions .",
    "it mixes galaxies in filaments and galaxies in clusters causing an increase of color scatter at given density , and therefore reduces the color - density correlation coefficient considerably . the survey boundary affects environment measurements mainly in low density regions , biasing both the environmental density and the ellipticity to lower values .",
    "the effect is notable for galaxies within @xmath121 of the survey boundary .",
    "while it is negligible for @xmath2420 , the effect is considerable for @xmath2418 which occupies a relatively small volume and therefore has a large fraction of its galaxies close to the boundary .",
    "it induces an artificial correlation between galaxy properties and the environmental ellipticity for @xmath2418 .    in summary",
    ", our analysis of sdss data shows that in addition to environment density , there is no significant further dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of large scale structure .",
    "geometrically , both ellipticity and density on one smoothing scale correlate strongly with each other , and with ellipticity / density on other smoothing scales .",
    "if the smoothing scale is not chosen properly , an appeared dependence of galaxy properties on both environment ellipticity and environment density arises which is merely due to geometry .",
