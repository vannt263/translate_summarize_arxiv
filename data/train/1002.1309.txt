    "we consider the effect of photoionization by the metagalactic radiation field on the non - equilibrium ionization states in the conduction fronts .",

    "non - equilibrium effects become significant when the ionization time - scale is long compared to the rate of temperature change .",
    "the gas then tends to remain `` underionized '' compared to gas in ionization equilibrium at the same temperature .",
    "because the energy losses in the evaporating gas are dominated by atomic and ionic line emissions from many species , the cooling efficiencies are affected by the non - equilibrium abundances .",
    "for underionized gas , cooling is enhanced .",

    "theoretical models of cloud evaporation in a hot medium have been studied extensively .",
    "cowie & mckee  ( 1977 ) developed an analytical solution for the mass loss rate and temperature profile in static conductive interfaces around spherical clouds .",
    "in their solution , they included the possible effects of heat flow saturation that occurs when the electron mean free path is not small compared to the temperature scale height ( see  2 ) .",
    "the saturation in the flow can be measured by one global parameter , the `` saturation parameter '' @xmath0 .",
    "mckee & cowie  ( 1977 ) studied the effects of radiative losses on the interface .",
    "in particular , they demarcated the range of saturation parameters for which radiative losses may be neglected . the situation becomes much more complicated if the dynamics of the evaporation are affected by magnetic fields ( e.g.  slavin  1989 ; borkowski , balbus & fristrom  1990 ) or if the evaporation is time - dependent ( e.g.  shelton  1998 ; smith & cox  2001 ; vieser & hensler  2007 ) .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization in conductive interfaces was considered previously in several studies ( ballet , arnaud & rothenflug  1986 ; b@xmath7hringer & hartquist  1987 ; dalton & balbus  1993 ; slavin  1989 ; slavin & cox  1992 ; shelton  1998 ; smith & cox  2001 ) .",
    "however , most of these works explored only a limited range of parameters ( with @xmath10  @xmath11  k and @xmath12  pc ) , appropriate for interstellar clouds .",

    "we consider the effects of non - equilibrium cooling and reexamine the criterion derived by mckee & cowie  ( 1977 ) for the neglect of radiative losses in the evaporative flows .    as applications , we then focus on the example of the local `` ionized high - velocity clouds '' . over the past decade ,",

    "<S> we present computations of the ionization structure and metal - absorption properties of thermally conductive interface layers that surround evaporating warm spherical clouds , embedded in a hot medium . </S>",
    "<S> we rely on the analytical steady - state formalism of dalton and balbus to calculate the temperature profile in the evaporating gas , and we explicitly solve the time - dependent ionization equations for h , he , c , n , o , si , and s in the conductive interface . we include photoionization by an external field . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate how departures from equilibrium ionization affect the resonance - line cooling efficiencies in the evaporating gas , and determine the conditions for which radiative losses may be neglected in the solution for the evaporation dynamics and temperature profile . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that non - equilibrium cooling significantly increases the value of the saturation parameter @xmath0 at which radiative losses begin to affect the flow dynamics . as applications </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the ion fractions and projected column densities arising in the evaporating layers surrounding dwarf - galaxy - scale objects that are also photoionized by metagalactic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to the uv metal - absorption column densities observed in local highly - ionized metal - absorbers , located in the galactic corona or intergalactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> conductive interfaces significantly enhance the formation of high - ions such as c@xmath1 , n@xmath2 , and o@xmath3 relative to purely photoionized clouds , especially for clouds embedded in a high - pressure corona </S>",
    "<S> . however , the enhanced columns are still too low to account for the columns ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) observed in the local high - velocity metal - ion absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that column densities larger than @xmath6  @xmath5 can not be produced in evaporating clouds . </S>",
    "<S> our results do support the conclusion of savage and lehner , that absorption due to evaporating likely occurs in the local interstellar medium , with characteristic columns of @xmath6  @xmath5 . </S>"
