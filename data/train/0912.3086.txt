    "the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) , due to its computational advantages , is the only tractable approach to the calculation of ground- and excited - state properties of medium to heavy mass nuclei  @xcite .",
    "currently , nuclear edf calculations rely on phenomenologically adjusted skyrme and gogny functionals .",
    "even though these empirical functionals have been successful in providing a satisfactory description of bulk and certain spectroscopic properties of known nuclei , they lack predictive power away from the region where they are fit . in light of this",
    ", various groups are pursuing different strategies to improve the predictive power of such phenomenological functionals  @xcite .",
    "one of these approaches is based on the explicit addition of microscopic long - range physics  @xcite through the use of the density matrix expansion method  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in evolving chiral effective field theory ( eft ) interactions  @xcite to lower resolution scale using the renormalization group methods  @xcite makes the construction of microscopically - based energy density functionals a feasible endeavor . towards such a goal , we derive the hartree - fock contribution from chiral eft two- and three - nucleon interaction at n@xmath0lo .",
    "furthermore , the highly nonlocal nature of the resulting energy density functional requires the application of the density matrix expansion  @xcite to derive a skyrme - like quasi - local energy density functional  @xcite .",
    "still , the edf thus obtained only contains the hartree - fock physics such that further correlations must be added to produce any reasonable description of nuclei . in the short term",
    ", such an addition of correlations can be done empirically  @xcite .",
    "eventually though , it is our goal to compute higher - orders in perturbation theory and design a generalized density matrix expansion that is suited to simplify the non - localities in both space and time that arise beyond the hartree - fock level  @xcite .    the tremendous algebra required to derive a skyrme - like energy density functional from the exact hf energy through the dme makes a manual calculation impractical",
    "this is especially true for the contribution from the three - nucleon interaction .",
    "in addition , such a derivation displays several features that make it amenable to symbolic automation  @xcite : ( i ) it involves many similar and repetitive algebraic steps ( ii ) most of it does not involve numerical computation , and ( iii ) the part of it that seems to require numerical computation , such as multidimensional integrals , can be performed using a combination of analytic expansion and symbolic integration  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the first part of the mathematica solution in which we implemented the calculation of the hf energy from the chiral eft three - nucleon interaction at n@xmath0lo and its subsequent simplification and re - expression in terms of scalar / vector - isoscalar / isovector parts of the one - body density matrix .",
    "the second part , which is the subject of a subsequent publication , will deal with the application of the dme to the output of the first part , thereby yielding a skyrme - like energy density functional .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ 3nfhf ] , the starting expression of the hf contribution from the chiral eft three - nucleon interaction at n@xmath0lo is written in such a way that its mathematica implementation becomes transparent .",
    "this is followed by section [ mathe - implem ] where the mathematica implementation is discussed in detail .",
    "the subject of section [ moreonpack ] is devoted to the organization of the notebooks and the generation of the mathematica code itself from the attached python script , as well as to the modifications required to adapt the application of the notebook to more general three - nucleon interactions and to relax the isospin symmetry imposed in the present work .",
    "the last section contains the conclusions .",
    "from a general standpoint , three - nucleon interactions can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the volume used in the box - normalization of the momentum basis states @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the kronecker delta and @xmath6 is a matrix element in momentum space and an operator in spin - isospin space . in the above expression , the dependence of the interaction on spin and isospin degrees of freedom is not displayed .",
    "the chiral eft three - nucleon interaction at n@xmath0lo has three main components ( i ) the e - term ( ii ) the d - term and ( iii ) the c - term that are diagrammatically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_all ] . as the present work relies only on the operator structure of the interaction which is provided below , we do not specify the actual values of the various constants that appear in the interaction .",
    "refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the regulator function as we are dealing with a hf calculation .",
    "this is justified because the hf calculation does not probe high - momentum single - particle states . specifically , one can neglect the regulator so long as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the local fermi momentum and @xmath9 is the cutoff parameter employed in the interaction .",
    "the absence of the regulator function makes the interaction local in coordinate space .",
    "even though section  [ extension ] illustrates how to extend the approach to non - local interactions , the locality of the interaction brings significant reduction in the complexity of the second part of the problem , viz , the application of the dme to produce a quasi - local edf .",
    "lo and the relevant coupling constants of the interaction .",
    "[ fig_all ] ]      the following definitions hold for the various operators that appear in the analytical expressions for e- , d- and c - terms of the interaction that are stated below . @xmath10 and",

    "specifically , for the chiral eft three - nucleon interaction at n@xmath0lo , @xmath28 depends on @xmath29 and @xmath30 and , in general , on the spin - isospin coordinates of the three nucleons .",
    "after a few basic algebraic manipulations , the hf energy from the three - nucleon interaction can be expressed in terms of only one of the three @xmath31 operators , e.g. @xmath32 , as @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the exchange operator ( of particles @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) whereas @xmath37 denote occupied hf single - particle states .",
    "note that for ease of notation , we are using the single - particle basis that diagonalizes the one - body density matrix of the hf slater determinant .",
    "@xmath34 is defined as @xmath38 with @xmath39 the coordinate exchange operator and the spin - isospin exchange operators given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one can identify three groups of terms in eq . :",
    "direct , single exchange and double exchange terms .",
    "the direct term corresponds to the expectation value of @xmath32 , the single - exchange term to the expectation value of @xmath42 and the double - exchange term to that of @xmath43    @xmath44    as the derivation of the a skyrme - like quasi - local edf from the exact hf energy requires the application of the dme , we need to express the hf energy in the @xmath45 single - particle basis .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dme , as formulated  @xcite , is most naturally applicable to the one - body density matrix expressed in coordinate space .",
    "hence , we perform inverse - fourier transformation of the interaction to express the matrix elements in @xmath46 single - particle basis .",
    "this transformation leaves the spin - isospin dependencies untouched . confining the discussion to the @xmath47 dependence",

    "the only momentum vector that appears is @xmath108 and it appears twice as can be seen from the combination of eqs . and .",
    "since energy is invariant with respect to rotation in coordinate , spin and isospin spaces , we next form the list of all possible scalars from the selected group . in each scalar , we can pick only one of the two possible choices originating from the same density matrix .",

    ", it should be clear that we do nt need to further apply the dme to obtain a local energy density functional as the interaction is of zero - range .",

    "our convention is that , when using such an interaction in eqs . - , gradients must act on the density matrices prior to making use of the delta functions .",

    "the most important advantage of this automation is that once the rules for mapping the nonlocal densities onto the local ones are established , calculating the energy density functional for different spin - isospin and gradient structures requires a negligible fraction of the effort required to perform the corresponding derivation manually .",
