    "whenever a physical system has long - range interactions and/or long - range microscopic memory and/or evolves in a ( multi)fractal - like space - time , the extensive , boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics might turn out to be inadequate in the sense that it fails to provide _ finite _ values for relevant thermodynamical quantities of the system . in order to theoretically deal with nonextensive systems of this ( or analogous ) kind ,",
    "two major formalisms are available : the so - called quantum groups @xcite and the generalized thermostatistics ( gt ) , proposed by one of us a decade ago @xcite .",
    "this two formalisms present in fact deep connections @xcite .",
    "we focus here the gt . within this framework",
    ", nonextensivity is defined through a generalized entropic form , namely s_q = k(q ) where @xmath9 is a positive constant and @xmath10 is a set of probabilities associated to @xmath11 microscopic configurations . we can immediately check that the @xmath12 limit recovers the usual , extensive , bg entropy @xmath13 . also , if a composed system @xmath14 has probabilities which factorize into those corresponding to the subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then @xmath17 .",
    "this property exhibits the fact that @xmath1 characterizes the degree of nonextensivity of the system .    especially during the last five years",
    ", a wealth of works have appeared within this formalism .",
    "in fact , it is possible to ( losely ) classify these works as follows : ( i ) some of them @xcite address the generalization of relevant concepts and properties of standard thermostatistics , such as boltzmann s h - theorem , fluctuation - dissipation theorem , onsager reciprocity theorem , among others ; ( ii ) other gt works @xcite focuse applications to some physical systems where bg statistics is known to fail ( stellar polytropes , turbulence in electron - plasma , solar neutrino problem , peculiar velocities of spiral galaxies , levy anomalous diffusion , among others ) , and yields satisfactory results ; ( iii ) finally , an area of interest which is progressing rapidly , addresses the long standing puzzle of better understanding the physical meaning of the entropic index @xmath1 .",
    "this line concerns the study of nonlinear dynamical systems ( both low @xcite and high @xcite dimensional dissipative ones , as well as hamiltonian systems @xcite ) in order to clarify the connection between @xmath1 , the sensitivity to the initial conditions and a possible ( multi)fractality hidden in the dynamics of the system .",
    "this paper belongs to the last class of efforts and is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize recent related results . in section 3",
    "we introduce a new map which generalizes the circular one , and study its main properties .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the most important dynamical quantities that are used to characterize the chaotic systems are the liapunov exponent @xmath18 and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath19 ( the meaning of the subindex 1 will soon become transparent ) .",
    "let us define , for a one - dimensional map of the real variable @xmath20 , the quantity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are discrepancies of the initial conditions at times @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "it can be shown that , under quite generic conditions , @xmath26 satisfies the differential equation @xmath27 , hence @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the system is said to be _ strongly _ insensitive ( sensitive ) to the initial conditions .",
    "similarly , for a dynamical system under certain conditions , we can define @xmath19 as essentially the increase , per unit time , of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that , with some restrictions , @xmath32 if @xmath33 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "this is frequently referred to as the pesin equality @xcite .",
    "the case we are focusing in the present work is the so called _ marginal _ case , corresponding to @xmath35 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , in this case , the differential equation satisfied by @xmath26 is @xmath36 , hence    \\(t ) = ^1/(1-q ) ,    where @xmath37 is the generalized liapunov exponent .",
    "one can verify that @xmath38 recovers the standard , _ exponential _ case whereas @xmath39 yields a _ power - law _ behavior . if @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) the system is said to be _ weakly _ insensitive ( sensitive ) to the initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , for this marginal case we can define the generalized kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath42 as the increase , per unit time , of @xmath43 . finally ,",
    "for this anomalous case , it has been argued @xcite that the pesin equality itself can be generalized as follows : @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "recently , these ideas have been applied to some dissipative one - dimensional maps ( a logistic - like and a periodic - like map , sharing the same universality class , as well as the standard circular map , which belongs to a different universality class ) , and the numerical results suggested a close relationship between the nonextensivity parameter @xmath1 and the fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension @xmath7 associated with the dynamical attractor @xcite . very specifically , in those examples , when @xmath7 approaches unity ( which is the euclidean dimension of the system ) from below then @xmath1 also approaches unity from below , and does that in a _",
    "monotonic manner_. naturally , this fact strongly suggests that the validity of the statistical @xmath38 ( bg ) picture is intimately related to the _ full _ occupancy of the phase space .",
    "however , an important question which remains open is whether the full occupancy is _ sufficient _ for having a bg scenario .",
    "we will show here that it is not !",
    "we shall introduce in this paper a generalized circular map ( characterized by an inflexion power @xmath6 ) , and show that , at the critical point , @xmath47 , and nevertheless @xmath41 ! this fact consistently complements the new scaling relation proposed in @xcite , namely = - ,    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the extremes of the multifractal singularity spectrum @xmath5 of the attractor ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "this relation clearly indicates that once the scaling properties of the dynamical attractor are known , one can precisely infer the proper entropic index @xmath1 that must be used for other purposes .",
    "the circle map is an iterative mapping of one point on a circle to another of the same circle .",
    "this map describes dynamical systems possessing a natural frequency @xmath48 which are driven by an external force of frequency @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is known as the `` bare '' winding number .",
    "these systems tend to mode - lock at a frequency @xmath51 and @xmath52 is known as the `` dressed '' winding number . the standard circle map , for one - dimension ,",
    "is given by    _",
    "t+1 = + _ t - ( 2_t )   mod(1 ) ,    with @xmath53 ; @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    "the circle map is linear at the vicinity of its extremal point and exhibits only periodic motion . from now on we take @xmath56 , the onset value above which chaotic orbits exist . for this map ,",
    "once mode - locked , @xmath57 remains constant and rational for a small range of the parameter @xmath58 with the `` dressed '' versus `` bare '' winding number curve exhibiting a `` devil staircase '' aspect@xcite ( if @xmath59 then one shall use @xmath60 in order to leave it @xmath61 ) . at the onset to chaos , a set of zero measure and universal scaling dynamics is produced at special irrational dressed winding numbers which have the form of an infinite continued - fraction expansion @xmath62 with @xmath63 integers .",
    "the best studied one is when @xmath64 equals the golden mean , i.e. , @xmath65 ( @xmath66)@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the golden mean is the asymptotic ratio between consecutive numbers of the fibonacci series ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . in order to determine the bare winding number at this critical point , we iterate the map for a large number of time steps ( @xmath71 steps ) starting with @xmath72 and use a linear regression to numericaly compute @xmath64 .",
    "the bare winding number @xmath58 is then adjusted to have the renormalized winding number @xmath64 equal to the golden mean , which results in @xmath73 with these parameters , the standard circle map has a cubic inflexion ( @xmath74 ) near its extremal point @xmath75 .",
    "a generalized version of the circle map can be defined as    _",
    "t+1 = + ^z/3  ,    where @xmath76 ( @xmath74 reproduces the standard case ) . for every value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the golden mean of @xmath64 corresponds to different `` bare '' winding numbers , which we call as @xmath77 . in order to determine these critical values of @xmath58 , one searches , within a given precision ( @xmath78 digits in our calculations ) , the value of @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath79 with the same precision .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath77 , as a function of @xmath6 , are shown in fig .",
    "the numerical values are indicated in the table .",
    "we remark that , in the limit @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) we verify that @xmath82 ( @xmath83 with @xmath84 ) .    for our present purpose , a very important feature of this map",
    "is that , for every value of @xmath6 , the critical attractor visits the _",
    "entire _ circle ( @xmath85 ( mod 1 ) @xmath86 ) and therefore has a support fractal dimension @xmath87 .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath7 , using a box counting algorithm , are indicated in fig .",
    "2 . in what concerns the sensitivity to the initial conditions , the function @xmath88 is given by    ( t)= || = _ t=1^n \\{^z/3}= + = _",
    "t=1^n \\{^-1 }    and displays , for @xmath89 , a power - law divergence , @xmath90 , from where the value of @xmath1 can be calculated by measuring , on a log - log plot , the upper bound slope , @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath91 and @xmath92 cases have been illustrated ; see also the table .    in order to check the accuracy of the scaling relation ( 3 )",
    ", one needs to determine the @xmath3 and @xmath4 values of the @xmath93 curve .",
    "therefore , one has to study the structure of the trajectory @xmath94 , @xmath95, ... ,@xmath96 , ... and to estimate the singularity spectrum ( strength of singularities @xmath97 and their fractal dimensions @xmath98 ) of this cantor - like set . to perform the numerical calculation we truncate the series @xmath96 at a chosen fibonacci number @xmath99 ( we recall that @xmath100 gives the golden mean and therefore defines the proper scaling factor ) .",
    "the distances @xmath101 between consecutive points of the set define the natural scales for the partition with measures @xmath102 attributed to each segment .",
    "after that , the singularity spectrum can be directly obtained following a standard prescription@xcite . in general , @xmath103 and , in the present case , @xmath104 .",
    "we define @xmath105 through @xmath106 .    however , the situation for the generalized circle map is somewhat different than that of the standard circle map in the sense that the standard one has a fast convergence of the @xmath93 curve when larger number of iterations are considered , whereas the generalized map presents only a slow and oscillatory convergence .",
    "an example of a sequence of @xmath5 curves obtained from increasing number of iterations is shown in figure 4 .",
    "notice its non - monotonic behavior , specially near the upper edge . in figure 5 , we plot the numerically obtained values of @xmath3 , @xmath105 and @xmath4 as a function of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the number of iterations . from these data , we are not able to accuratelly estimate their asymptotic values for large map inflexion @xmath6 . in figure 6",
    "we plot the extrapolated @xmath93 curves for typical values of @xmath6 .",
    "although these show the main expected trends of the singularity spectra , namely @xmath6-dependent shape but @xmath109 for all @xmath6 , their extremal points may need further corrections . we shall point out that this feature is inherent to the numerical method used to estimate the @xmath93 curve representing the singularity strengths of a multifractal measure .",
    "its extremal points are governed by the scaling behavior of the most concentrated ( @xmath3 ) and most rarefied ( @xmath4 ) sets in the measure , the latter being usually poorly sampled .      in figure 7",
    ", we show the critical sequence of the distances around @xmath114 for a large value of the map inflexion ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the data provide an accurate estimation of the universal factor @xmath123 from which precise values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be inferred . in the table",
    "we list the results for @xmath124 , together with the values of @xmath105 from the extrapolated @xmath93 curves and @xmath1 obtained from both the scaling relation ( 3 ) and from the sensitivity function ( 7 ) .",
    "notice that the scaling relation ( 3 ) is satisfied for all @xmath6 ( see also figure 8) , just like the case of the logistic - like maps @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these results indicate two other important points : ( i ) even though the fractal dimension of the support @xmath7 is euclidean ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) for all @xmath6 , the system sensitivity to initial conditions is still @xmath6-dependent .",
    "( ii ) what matters is @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and not @xmath7 , in other words , what precisely controls the entropic index @xmath1 is not @xmath7 but the sensitivity to initial conditions , reflected by the multifractal nature of the attractor .",
    "in this paper , we contribute to the field of low - dimensional dissipative systems by introducing a convenient generalization ( with inflexion power @xmath6 ) of the standard circular map and then studying its critical point ( analogous to the chaos threshold of logistic - like maps ) .",
    "more precisely , we have numerically studied its sensitivity to the initial conditions and have shown that it is given by a _",
    "power_-law ( @xmath125 ) instead of the usual _ exponential _ behavior .",
    "moreover , we have shown that this example , as the logistic - like maps , satisfies the scaling law given in eq .",
    "although @xmath126 and @xmath4 depend on @xmath6 , @xmath7 _ does not_. this is a quite important result because it illustrates that , for having a boltzmann - gibbs scenario ( @xmath38 ) , it is not enough to fully occupy the phase space during the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "what is essentially necessary is to have a _ quick _ , exponential - like occupation of the phase space , so that ergodicity and mixing are naturally attained .",
    "in addition to this , it is worth mentioning that there are also other efforts along this line which address high - dimensional dissipative systems , namely those exhibiting self - organized criticality @xcite . amongst them",
    ", the study of the bak - sneppen model for biological evolution @xcite and the suzuki - kaneko model for the battle of birds defending their territories @xcite can be enumerated . in both cases",
    "it is shown that , at the self - organized critical state , a power - law sensitivity to initial conditions emerges , like in the present case .    as a final remark",
    ", it should be emphasized that these ideas seem to be valid and applicable not only to low- and high - dimensional dissipative systems but also to conservative ( hamiltonian ) systems with long - range interactions .",
    "this fact has been illustrated very recently @xcite on the long - range classical @xmath127 ferromagnetic model , whose entire liapunov spectrum collapses ( for an infinitely wide energy interval ) to zero at the thermodynamic limit if ( and only if ) the range of the interactions is sufficiently long .",
    "further efforts focusing , along these lines , both dissipative and conservative systems are welcome .",
