    "the last few years have seen important progress in calculating the thermodynamic properties of condensed matter using _ ab initio _ techniques based on density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "there has been particular attention to the thermodynamics of crystals , whose harmonic free energy can be obtained from phonon frequencies computed by standard dft methods  @xcite .",
    "the _ ab initio _ treatment of liquid - state thermodynamics is also important , and thermodynamic integration has been shown to be an effective way of calculating the dft free energy of liquids  @xcite .",
    "these developments have made it possible to treat phase equilibria , including melting properties , by completely _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "we report here dft free - energy calculations on high - pressure / high - temperature liquid iron , which we combine with earlier results on the solid  @xcite to obtain the complete melting curve and the variation of the volume and entropy of melting along the curve .",
    "we also present results for some key thermodynamic properties of the liquid , which we compare with data from shock experiments and other sources .",
    "the general methods developed here may be useful for other problems involving phase equilibria under extreme conditions .",
    "a brief report of this work was presented earlier  @xcite .",
    "the properties of high - pressure / high - temperature fe are of great scientific importance because the earth s core consists mainly of fe , with a minor fraction of light impurities  @xcite .",
    "the melting curve is particularly important , since it provides one of the very few ways of estimating the temperature at the boundary between the liquid outer core and the solid inner core  @xcite .",
    "because of this , strenuous efforts have been made to measure the melting curve  @xcite , but the extreme pressures and temperatures required ( @xmath0  gpa , @xmath1  k ) make the experiments very demanding .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations therefore have a major role to play , and several independent attempts to obtain the melting curve using different _ ab initio _ strategies have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "the rather unsatisfactory agreement between the predictions makes a full presentation of the technical methods all the more important .",
    "the calculation of melting properties using _ ab initio _ free energies was pioneered by sugino and car  @xcite in their work on the melting of si at ambient pressure .",
    "related methods were subsequently used by de  wijs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to study the melting of al . in both cases , thermodynamic integration",
    "( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) was used to obtain the _ ab initio _ free energy from the free energy of a simple reference system , and we follow the same strategy here .",
    "the other recent calculations  @xcite on the high - pressure melting of fe employed _ ab initio _ methods in a different way .",
    "free energies were not calculated , but instead an empirical parameterised form of the total - energy function was fitted to dft total energies calculated for representative configurations of the solid and liquid . the empirical energy function was then used in molecular dynamics simulations of very large systems containing coexisting solid and liquid .",
    "the detailed dft techniques used in this work are identical to those used in our work on h.c.p . fe  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) for exchange - correlation energy , in the form known as perdew - wang 1991  @xcite , which reproduces very accurately a wide range of experimental properties of solid iron , as noted in more detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we also use the projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) implementation of dft  @xcite , which is an all - electron technique similar to other standard implementations such as full - potential augmented plane waves ( flapw )  @xcite , as well as being closely related to the ultrasoft pseudopotential method  @xcite .",
    "we have used the vasp code  @xcite , which is exceptionally stable an efficient for metals , with the implementation of an extrapolation of the charge density which increases the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations by almost a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of melting properties demands very high precision for the free energies of the two phases , as emphasised elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the required precision is set by the value of the entropy of melting , and one finds that in order to calculate the melting temperature to within 100  k the non - cancelling error in the free energies must be reduced to @xmath2  mev / atom .",
    "the use of identical electronic - structure methods in the two phases is clearly necessary ; but it is certainly not sufficient , since the detailed free - energy techniques differ in the two phases . in the solid , we relied heavily on harmonic calculations , whereas the liquid - state calculations rely on relating the free energy to that of a reference liquid .",
    "it is therefore essential to reduce the statistical - mechanical errors below the tolerance , and we aim to demonstrate that this has been achieved .    in the next section ,",
    "we summarise the technical methods , and sec .  3 then reports our results for the dft free energy of liquid fe over a wide range of thermodynamic states .",
    "presents our calculated melting properties , which we compare with experimental results and the predictions of other _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "our free - energy results have been used to compute a variety of other thermodynamic quantities for the liquid , and we compare these in secs .",
    "[ sec : hugoniot ] and [ sec : liq_therm ] with direct shock measurements as well as published extrapolations of other experimental data . in the final section , we give further discussion and a summary of our conclusions .",
    "the key thermodynamic quantity calculated in this work is the _ ab initio _ helmholtz free energy @xmath3 , which , with the statistical mechanics of the nuclei treated in the classical limit , is : @xmath4 \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are the positions of the @xmath7 nuclei , @xmath8 is the thermal wavelength , with @xmath9 the nuclear mass and @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is the dft electronic free energy calculated with the @xmath7 nuclei fixed at positions @xmath12 .",
    "this is given , following the mermin formulation of finite - temperature dft  @xcite , by @xmath13 , where the dft energy @xmath14 is the usual sum of kinetic , electron - nucleus , hartree and exchange - correlation terms , and @xmath15 is the electronic entropy , given by the independent - electron formula : @xmath16 $ ] , with @xmath17 the thermal ( fermi - dirac ) occupation number of orbital @xmath18 .",
    "in exact dft , the exchange correlation ( free ) energy @xmath19 has an explicit dependence on @xmath20 but we assume here that @xmath21 has its zero - temperature form . it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that quantum corrections to the classical approximation to the free energy are negligible in the high - temperature solid , and the same will be true _ a fortiori _ in the liquid .",
    "our earlier work  @xcite should be consulted for technical details of the paw implementation of dft that we use .",
    "we note here that under earth s core conditions it is not accurate enough to neglect the response of the @xmath22 electrons , and in principle these should be explicitly included in the valence set along with the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 electrons .",
    "however , as shown earlier  @xcite , the computational effort of including 3@xmath25 electrons explicitly can be avoided with almost no loss of precision by mimicking the effect of the 3@xmath25 electrons by an effective pair potential . the procedure for constructing this pair potential",
    "was described in ref .",
    "the pair potential used here is exactly the same as we used in our thermodynamic calculations on the h.c.p .",
    "solid , so that a good cancellation of any residual errors is expected . to avoid any possible doubt on this score ,",
    "we have also done spot checks on the effect of including both 3@xmath26 and 3@xmath25 electrons explicitly in the valence set , as reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : melting ] .",
    "the outermost core radius in our paw calculations is 1.16   . at earth s",
    "core pressures , the atoms in both liquid and solid come closer than the diameter of the ionic cores , which therefore overlap",
    ". we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : melting ] that this too has only a very small effect on the free energies .    the present calculations , like those reported earlier on the h.c.p . solid , make use of ` thermodynamic integration '  @xcite , which is a completely general technique for determining the difference of free energies @xmath27 of two systems whose total - energy functions are @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the basic idea is that @xmath27 represents the reversible work done on continuously and isothermally switching the energy function from @xmath29 to @xmath28 .",
    "to do this switching , a continuously variable energy function @xmath30 is defined as : @xmath31 so that the energy goes from @xmath29 to @xmath28 as @xmath32 goes from 0 to 1 . in classical statistical mechanics ,",
    "the work done in an infinitesimal change @xmath33 is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the thermal average evaluated for the system governed by @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath36 we use this technique to calculate the _ ab initio _ free energy @xmath37 of liquid fe by identifying @xmath28 as the _ ab initio _ total energy function @xmath38 and @xmath29 as the total energy @xmath39 of a simple model reference system , whose free energy @xmath40 can be calculated .",
    "then @xmath37 is given by : @xmath41 in practice , we calculate @xmath42 for a suitable set of @xmath32 values , and perform the integration numerically .",
    "the average @xmath43 is evaluated at each @xmath32 using constant - temperature _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics , with the time evolution generated by the total - energy function @xmath44 .    as explained in more detail elsewhere  @xcite , the computational effort needed to perform the thermodynamic integration",
    "is greatly reduced if the fluctuations of the energy difference @xmath45 are small , for two reasons .",
    "first , the amount of sampling needed to calculated @xmath46 to a given precision is reduced ; second , the variation of @xmath46 as @xmath32 goes from 0 to 1 is reduced .",
    "in fact , if the fluctuations @xmath47 are small enough , one can neglect this variation and approximate @xmath48 , with the average taken in the _ ab - initio _ ensemble . if this is not good enough , the next approximation is readily shown to be : @xmath49 our task is therefore to search for a model @xmath50 for which the fluctuations @xmath51 are as small as possible .",
    "the problem of mimicking the fluctuations of _ ab initio _ energy @xmath52 in high-@xmath25/high-@xmath53 liquid fe using a reference system was studied in detail in a recent paper  @xcite .",
    "we showed there that a @xmath50 consisting of a sum of pair potentials : @xmath54 in which @xmath55 can be arranged to mimic the fluctuations of @xmath52 very precisely , if we choose @xmath56 to be a repulsive inverse - power potential @xmath57 , with suitable values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this expression for @xmath50 , we have included a term @xmath60 which depends on thermodynamic state , but does not depend on the positions @xmath5 .",
    "we define this @xmath61 so as to minimize the mean square value of @xmath62 , which requires the following condition : @xmath63 it might at first seem surprising that such a simple @xmath50 can reproduce @xmath52 accurately , since it does not explicitly represent the metallic bonding due to partial filling of the @xmath64-band , which is absorbed into the term @xmath60 .",
    "however , the only requirement on @xmath50 is that the fluctuations @xmath65 should be small for the given liquid state , and we shall demonstrate below that this is indeed achieved .",
    "we comment further on this question in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    the free energy of the reference system can be expressed as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the free energy associated with @xmath68 .",
    "an important advantage of our chosen form of @xmath50 is that @xmath67 depends non - trivially only on a single thermodynamic variable , rather than depending separately on temperature @xmath53 and atomic number density @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the excess free energy of the reference system , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between @xmath67 and the free energy @xmath71 of the perfect gas at the given @xmath53 and @xmath69",
    ". then the quantity @xmath72 depends only on the dimensionless thermodynamic parameter @xmath73 defined as : @xmath74 this simplifies the representation of @xmath75 , since we can write : @xmath76    we also expect the representation of @xmath60 to be simple .",
    "note first that since @xmath60 is defined so that @xmath77 , then from eqn  ( [ eqn : uth_def ] ) we must have : @xmath78 now if the fluctuations of @xmath79 are indeed small , then the value of @xmath80 should be very close to the value of @xmath79 evaluated at zero temperature with all atoms on the sites of the perfect h.c.p .",
    "lattice having the same density as the liquid . denoting by @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 the values of the zero - temperature _ ab initio _ and pair - potential energies for the perfect lattice , and defining @xmath83 , we can then write : @xmath84 where @xmath85 will be a small quantity depending weakly on volume and temperature .",
    "the accurate computation and representation of @xmath81 were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the accurate computation of @xmath82 is clearly trivial , so that the treatment of @xmath86 is straightforward .",
    "the small difference @xmath87 is evaluated from the aimd simulations described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ref2full ] .",
    "we conclude this section by summarising our route to the calculation of the _ ab initio _ free energy @xmath37 of the liquid .",
    "we employ eqn  ( [ eqn:2nd_order ] ) , ignoring the higher - order fluctuation terms .",
    "recalling that @xmath88 , and combining eqns  ( [ eqn : f_ref ] ) and ( [ eqn : delta_uth ] ) , we have : @xmath89 we now turn to the calculation of the reduced free energy @xmath90 of the reference system and the small quantities @xmath85 and @xmath91",
    ". we shall also give evidence that with our chosen reference model the higher - order fluctuation terms omitted from eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) are indeed negligible .",
    "the paw calculations used to validate the inverse - power reference system are those reported in ref .",
    "they consist of a set of aimd simulations performed at 16 thermodynamic states covering the temperature range @xmath92  k and the pressure range @xmath93  gpa .",
    "all the simulations were performed on a 67-atom system using @xmath94-point sampling , with a time step of 1  fs .",
    "we stress that such a small system with such limited sampling can not be expected to yield very precise results for thermodynamic quantities , and our only purpose here is to demonstrate the adequacy of the reference system . at each thermodynamic state ,",
    "the system was equilibrated using the reference system itself , and aimd data were then accumulated for a time span of 5  ps .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the inverse - power model , with parameters @xmath95 and @xmath58 chosen so that for @xmath96    the potential @xmath97 is 1.95  ev , reproduces very closely the _ ab initio _",
    "liquid for the state @xmath98  k , @xmath99  kg  m@xmath100 .",
    "we have studied the strength of the @xmath101 fluctuations for all 16 thermodynamic states , using exactly the same reference model for all states , and we report in table  [ tab : fluct ] the normalized strength of these fluctuations , which we characterize by the quantity @xmath102^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "two points should be noted : first , @xmath103 is small , since its typical value of 100  mev is markedly smaller than the typical thermal energies @xmath104 ( 258  mev at the lowest temperature of 3000  k ) .",
    "once @xmath103 is as small as this , little is gained by further improvement of the reference system .",
    "second , @xmath103 does not vary strongly with thermodynamic state , so that the reference system specified by the values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 given above can be used for all the thermodynamic states of interest here .      in order to cover the range of thermodynamic states of liquid fe that interests us",
    ", we need accurate values of the excess free energy of the reference system for @xmath73 values going from 2.5 to 5.0 .",
    "there have been many studies of the thermodynamic properties of inverse - power systems , including one on the free energy of the liquid @xmath105 system  @xcite , but since these do not provide what we need we have made our own calculations of @xmath106 for the @xmath107 case .",
    "our strategy is to start with standard literature values for the excess free energy of the lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid ( we use the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and to use thermodynamic integration to go from the lj system to the inverse - power system , so that @xmath29 and @xmath28 in eqns  ( [ eqn : thermint_1][eqn : thermint_2 ] ) represent the lj and inverse - power total energies respectively . in doing this",
    ", our target was to keep technical errors small enough so that the final free energy @xmath75 is correct to better than 5  mev / atom .",
    "we note the following technical points .",
    "the calculations were done at a standard volume per atom , usually taken to be 8.67  @xmath108 , with the temperature chosen to give the required value of @xmath73 .",
    "ewald techniques were used to avoid cutting off the inverse - power potential at any distance  we regarded this as essential , since a cut - off would compromise the scaling properties of the reference system .",
    "the classical molecular dynamics simulations used to compute @xmath109 were done using the constant - temperature technique , with each atom taken to have a mass of 55.86 a.u . , and the time - step set equal to 1  fs . for each thermodynamic state",
    ", we are free to choose any convenient values for the lj parameters @xmath110 and @xmath103 .",
    "our criterion for choosing these is that the fluctuations of @xmath111 should be kept reasonably small , but with the proviso that the initial lj system must be in the liquid state . in many cases ,",
    "we have checked for consistency by using different @xmath110 and @xmath103 values .",
    "since we require @xmath106 in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size , we have made careful checks on size effects .",
    "tests on systems containing up to 499 atoms show that size errors in @xmath106 are less than 1 mev / atom , and this is small enough to ensure that @xmath75 has a precision of better than 5  mev .",
    "most of this error arises from the error in the literature values of the lj free energy .",
    "as a further check on our techniques , we have done calculations on the @xmath105 system at selected thermodynamic states , and compared with the free energy results of laird and haymet  @xcite .",
    "we have checked our procedures by repeating most of the calculations using the perfect gas as reference system , so as to be free from possible errors in the free energy of the lj system . for these calculations",
    "we used a different form for @xmath30 , namely @xmath112 where @xmath28 is the total energy of the inverse power system and @xmath113 is that of the perfect gas . using this functional form eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermint_3 ] ) becomes @xmath114 the advantage of using this different functional form for @xmath30 is that the value of the integrand does not need to be computed for @xmath115 , where the dynamics of the system is that of the perfect gas . in this case , since there are no forces in the system , there is nothing to prevent the atoms from overlapping , and the potential energy @xmath28 diverges .",
    "not computing the integrand at @xmath116 only partially solves this problem , since for small values of @xmath32 the forces on the atoms are small , the atoms can come close together , and the potential energy @xmath28 fluctuates violently",
    ". however , we found that by performing long enough simulations , typically 1  ns , we could calculate the integral with an accuracy of _ ca .",
    "_  1  mev / atom . these calculations with the perfect - gas reference system",
    "give excess free energies of the inverse power system that are systematically 5  mev / atom lower than those obtained using the lj reference system .",
    "our belief is that the discrepancy arises from a small systematic error in the free energies given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after all these tests , calculations of @xmath106 were done at a regularly spaced set of @xmath73 values at intervals of 0.25 , and we found that the results could be fitted to the required precision by the following 3rd - degree polynomial : @xmath117 the values of the coefficients are : @xmath118 .      to achieve our target precision of 10  mev / atom in the _ ab initio _ free energy @xmath37 of the liquid , two sources of error must be studied : system size effects and electronic @xmath119-point sampling . an important point to note",
    "is that these errors only affect the small terms @xmath85 and @xmath120 in eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) , since @xmath106 refers already to the infinite system , and @xmath119-point errors in @xmath86 are negligible .",
    "we also study the validity of neglecting the higher - order fluctuation terms in eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) .",
    "we focus first on the quantity @xmath85 in eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) .",
    "to study size errors in this quantity , we calculated the thermal average @xmath121 for a range of system sizes .",
    "these test calculations were done on systems of up to 241 atoms at @xmath122  @xmath108/atom and @xmath98  k using @xmath94-point sampling .",
    "the preparation and equilibration of these systems were done using the inverse - power reference system . since the latter so closely mimics the _ ab initio _",
    "system for the 67-atom cell , it should provide a well equilibrated starting point for _ ab initio _ simulation of larger systems .",
    "the duration of all the _ ab initio _ simulations after equilibration was 1  ps .",
    "the results of these tests are summarised in table  [ tab : size_and_kpoints ] , where we report the value of @xmath85 per atom , i.e. the quantity @xmath123 / n$ ] ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : techniques ] ) . since @xmath124 is independent of the system size , the variation of the reported quantity arises solely from size dependence of @xmath125 .",
    "we see that with @xmath126 atoms @xmath127 is converged to better than 5  mev / atom , and that already with 67 atoms the size error is of the order of 10  mev / atom .",
    "we tested for @xmath119-point errors in @xmath85 by performing calculations using both four and 32 monkhorst - pack  @xcite sampling points . since explicit aimd calculations with",
    "so many @xmath119-points would be extremely expensive , we use the following procedure . from an existing @xmath94-point simulation",
    "we take a set of typically 10 atomic configurations separated by 0.1  ps .",
    "the _ ab initio _ total energies of these configurations calculated with the different @xmath119-point samplings are then compared . for sampling with four @xmath119-points , we did calculations on systems of up to 241 atoms , but the heavier calculations with 32 @xmath119-points were done only on the 67-atom system .",
    "the results of these tests for the thermodynamic state @xmath122  @xmath108/atom and @xmath98  k are also reported in table  [ tab : size_and_kpoints ] , where we see that for the smallest system containing 67 atoms the difference with respect to a calculation with the @xmath94-point only is @xmath128  mev / atom , but as the number of atoms in the cell is increased above @xmath126 the difference becomes negligible .",
    "the result for the calculation with 32 @xmath119-points is identical to the one with four @xmath119-points and is not reported in the table .",
    "we also found that fluctuations of the energy differences between the calculations done with the @xmath94-point only and those with 4 @xmath119-points are extremely small .",
    "similar , but less extensive , tests of system - size and @xmath119-point errors have also been performed at the state @xmath129",
    "@xmath108/atom , @xmath130  k , and we find that the variation of these errors with system size is numerically almost the same as before .",
    "the indication is therefore that @xmath85 can be obtained to a precision of _ ca . _  5  mev / atom from simulations on systems of 125 atoms or more .",
    "unfortunately , it is not practicable yet to do all our aimd simulations with this system size , and in practice we have computed @xmath85 from @xmath94-point simulations on the 67-atom system , and corrected the results by adding 10  mev / atom , which from the present evidence appears to the almost constant error in the @xmath94-point 67-atom results .",
    "as expected , the numerical values of @xmath85 are small , and depend weakly on temperature and pressure across the range of thermodynamic states of interest .",
    "we find that they can be represented to within @xmath131  mev / atom by a sum of third - degree polynomials in @xmath132 and @xmath53 : @xmath133 with the following fitting parameters ( units of ev ,   and k ) : @xmath134 ; @xmath135 ; @xmath136 ; @xmath137 ; @xmath138 ; @xmath139 ; @xmath140 ; @xmath141 .    to test the validity of neglecting the higher - order fluctuation terms omitted from eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) , we have performed full thermodynamic integration for four different thermodynamic states , the first three with @xmath122  @xmath108/atom and @xmath98 , 6000 and 8000  k and the fourth with @xmath129  @xmath108/atom and @xmath142  k , using the five equally spaced @xmath32 values 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1.0 .",
    "these calculations were done using @xmath94-point sampling on the system of 67 atoms .",
    "we have seen that this system size is not big enough to yield the required precision for @xmath37 , but it should certainly be enough to test the adequacy of the second - order formula . in table  [ tab : small_lambda ] we report a comparison between the results obtained from the integral using the five @xmath32 values and those from the second order formula , and we see that they are practically indistinguishable .",
    "the table also indicates that the term @xmath143 is rather insensitive to thermodynamic state and can be approximated to the required precision by setting it equal to 10  mev / atom .",
    "we have used this constant value in evaluating the _ ab initio _ free energy by eqn  ( [ eqn : f_ai ] ) .",

    "the new shock results of nguyen and holmes  @xcite using improved techniques indicate that there is no solid - solid transition , and we place greater weight on their hugoniot melting point .",

    "@xcite ( see also following section ) .",
    "we now consider possible sources of error in our dft calculations .",
    "first , we recall that even with the best available gga for exchange - correlation energy the low - temperature @xmath148 relation for h.c.p . fe is not in perfect agreement with experiment .",
    "this has been shown by a number of independent calculations using all - electron techniques  @xcite as well as pseudopotential  @xcite and paw  @xcite techniques , all of which agree closely with each other .",
    "roughly speaking , the pressure is underpredicted by _",
    "ca . _  10  gpa at near - ambient pressures and by _ ca . _  8  gpa in the region of 300  gpa .",
    "the pressure error can be thought of as arising from an error in the helmholtz free energy , so that the true free energy @xmath149 can be written as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is our calculated free energy and @xmath152 is the correction .",
    "if we take the pressure error @xmath153 to be linear in the volume , then @xmath152 can be represented as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are adjustable parameters determined by least - squares fitting to the experimental pressure .",
    "if we now neglect the temperature dependence of @xmath152 , and simply add @xmath157 to the calculated free energies of solid and liquid , this gives a way of gauging our likely errors .",

    "_  70  k in the region of 300  gpa .    the second error source we consider is the paw implementation , and specifically our choice of the division into core and valence states , and the paw core radii .",
    "as mentioned earlier , at earth s core pressures the @xmath22 electrons , and to a lesser extent the @xmath158 electrons , must be treated as valence states .",
    "moreover , the choice of the maximum paw core radius may also affect the calculations , because under such high pressures and temperatures the atoms come so close that the cores overlap .",
    "these errors may affect the melting curve if they fail to cancel between the liquid and the solid . to check both these possible problems ,",
    "we have performed trial paw calculations with the much smaller core radius of 0.85  and with both @xmath158 and @xmath22 states in the valence set ; with this choice of core radius the overlap of the cores in the liquid and the high temperature solid is almost negligible .",
    "we have then used eq .",
    "( [ eqn : second_order ] ) to calculate the free energy difference between the systems described with the two paw approximations , repeating the calculations for both the liquid and the solid . to do that we have drawn two sets of 30 statistically independent configurations from two long simulations performed with the original paw approximation on the solid and the liquid at @xmath159  @xmath108/atom and @xmath160  k.",
    "as expected , we find a significant shift in the total electronic ( free ) energies .",
    "this shift is almost constant , thus validating the use of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : second_order ] ) , but the important result is that it is almost the same for the liquid and the solid , the two numbers being @xmath161  ev / atom @xmath162  ev / atom . here , @xmath163 is the free energy calculated with small core and @xmath158 and @xmath22 states in valence , and @xmath164 the free energy with large core and the @xmath158 and @xmath22 frozen in the core , plus the effective pair - potential ; the superscripts @xmath26 and @xmath165 indicate the solid and the liquid respectively .",
    "the effect is small , and stabilises the liquid by 6  mev / atom , which has the effect of shifting the melting curve down by @xmath166  k.    as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : melting_curve ] , if we include both these corrections they bring our low - temperature melting curve into quite respectable agreement with the dac measurements of shen _ et al .",

    "( this relation is satisfied identically by our results , since they are all derived from free energies . )",
    "the strong decrease of @xmath173 between 50 and 200  gpa and its approximate constancy thereafter is mainly due to the variation of @xmath171 .",
    "since shock experiments are the only direct way of obtaining thermodynamic information for high-@xmath25/high-@xmath53 liquid fe , it is important to test our predictions against the available shock data .",

    "[ sec : hugoniot ] ) , it is possible that some of the disagreements may be due to deficiencies in the experimental extrapolation .",
    "in assessing the reliability of our results , we consider three sources of error : first , the uncontrolled dft errors inherent in the gga for exchange and correlation energy ; second , the controllable errors in the detailed electronic - structure implementation of gga , and specifically in the use of paw to calculate the total _ ab initio _ ( free ) energy @xmath210 for each set of atomic positions @xmath12 ; third , the statistical - mechanical errors , including system - size effects .",
