    "in high energy heavy ion collisions , it is believed that a new form of strong interaction matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is created and observed . while normal nuclear matter has its smallest building blocks  the quarks and gluons  deeply confined inside hadrons , when heated to high enough temperature these quarks and gluons get deconfined to form the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the qgp is primordially hot and dense : it once occupied the early universe at a few microseconds after the big bang , and is now the hottest matter created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "transport properties provide unique means of probing the structure and dynamics of matter .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) fields , for example , were used hundreds of years ago to induce charge transport processes inside normal materials , the responses of which were measured and the interpretations of which significantly advanced our understanding of those condensed matter systems .",
    "important findings such as ohm s law , the generation of electric current in response to external electric field @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the absolute value of electron charge , were made .",
    "more recent examples of probing matter with em field induced transport include , e.g. the famous quantum hall systems .    for the qgp as a new form of strong interaction matter , its charge transport properties under external ( maxwell ) electric and magnetic fields are of great theoretical interest as well as of phenomenological importance .",
    "in particular , significant efforts have been made to understand the _",
    "anomalous transport effects _ in the qgp , with the so - called chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite as a distinguished example .",
    "the term `` anomalous '' implies that these effects do not exist in normal circumstance due to symmetry constraint ( e.g. parity ) but can occur in a parity - odd _",
    "environment_. in the hot qgp created in heavy ion collisions as well as that occupying early universe , such an environment ( a p - odd bubble of qgp ) may indeed exist due to the topological fluctuations in the gluonic configurations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( see e.g. discussions in @xcite ) . with chiral symmetry restoration at high temperature the light flavor quarks",
    "are approximately chiral in qgp and through the famous triangle anomaly the parity - oddness from qcd topological fluctuations gets translated into an imbalance of quark chirality ( i.e. difference between number of right - handed and left - handed quarks ) , usually parameterized by a nonzero axial chemical potential @xmath12 .",
    "the cme predicts the generation of an electric current @xmath13 in response to an external magnetic field @xmath14 , @xmath15 . the coefficient of proportionality ( cme conductivity ) was computed and found to be fixed by axial anomaly uniquely and universal from weak to strong coupling if the dynamical gauge bosons are absent  @xcite .",
    "when the dynamical gauge bosons are included in the calculation , however , the cme conductivity may receive radiative corrections ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the case of an external electric field @xmath16 was investigated only very recently and a new effect , the chiral electric separation effect ( cese ) , was found in @xcite .",
    "the cese predicts the generation of an axial current @xmath1 in response to the electric field , @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the chemical potential corresponding to certain vector charge density ) .",
    "interesting collective excitations arising from interplay between vector and axial currents in external @xmath16 and/or @xmath14 fields have also been studied and nontrivial modes such as chiral magnetic wave ( cmw )  @xcite and chiral electric wave ( cew )  @xcite have been identified .",
    "the cmw is based on the mutual induction of @xmath19 via the cme and another effect known as chiral separation effect ( cse , which induces an axial current along magnetic field )  @xcite with both of them propagating in an entangled manner .",
    "finally as pointed out first in @xcite , in a relativistically rotating fluid a quantum particle feels a similarity between fluid vorticity and an external magnetic field , and thus a new effect in analogy to cme has been found to predict the generation of a vector current along the vorticity @xmath20 known as chiral vortical effect ( cve )  @xcite . for recent reviews on such anomalous transport effects , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of any such anomalous transport effect in e.g. heavy ion collisions would provide indications of the manifestation of qcd topology and anomaly as well as possible `` environmental symmetry violation '' in primordial matter .",
    "it is thus of fundamental significance . in recent years a lot of experimental efforts have been invested to look for one or more of the anomalous transport effects in heavy ion collisions at rhic and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "charge - dependent azimuthal correlations have been measured across a wide span of collision beam energy to search for a charge separation across the reaction plane ( i.e. an out - of - plane charge dipole ) possibly induced by cme  @xcite .",
    "the charge - dependent splitting of pion elliptic flow has also been measured with very encouraging features in line with a charge quadruple distribution of qgp induced by cmw  @xcite .",
    "a new measurement of a possible baryon separation across the reaction plane has also been released by the star collaboration  @xcite , which might be induced by cve .",
    "many works have been done in order to fully and accurately extract the interpretations of these data and their implications for the search of anomalous transport effects  @xcite . at this point",
    "the status of such search is not conclusive yet ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) , with more detailed measurements , more sophisticated modelings , as well as more precise theoretical determinations of pertinent transport coefficients badly needed .",
    "this paper will focus on studying the newly introduced chiral electric separation effect in the qgp . specifically , we aim to quantify a new transport property , the cese conductivity , of the qgp in a high enough temperature regime where a perturbative framework can be justified .",
    "previous works have computed this conductivity for a qed plasma  @xcite and for strongly coupled holographic gauge plasma  @xcite .",
    "the precise value of cese conductivity for qgp , however , is not calculated yet to the best of our knowledge .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to determine this quantity .",
    "we will first use the kinetic theory framework to develop an intuitive picture of the emergence of the cese and point out the general structure of the cese conductivity .",
    "next we use the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) framework to compute the cese conductivity to the leading - log accuracy for high temperature qgp .",
    "summary of our results and physical discussions will given in the end .",
    "kinetic theory provides a natural and simple framework to intuitively understand the current generation as linear response to externally applied fields . very recently a number of studies  @xcite have used kinetic framework to understand the various anomalous transport effects mentioned above . here",
    "let us use this approach to show in general how the cese arises in a plasma containing charged chiral fermions . in kinetic theory , we use a phase space distribution function @xmath21 to describe each species of the fermions , with indices defined as follows : @xmath22 with @xmath23 for positively / negatively charged and @xmath24 for right - handed / left - handed fermions , respectively .",
    "the distribution function evolves according to the boltzmann equation @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 on the left - hand side ( lhs ) is the external force acting on the fermions and the collision kernel on the right - hand side ( rhs ) is a functional depending on the distributions of all particle species involved in the microscopic interactions with the fermions ( including those beyond the fermions we consider , e.g. gluons ) .    at this point , some comments are in order . for a plasma containing chiral fermions ,",
    "the kinetic equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) is not complete because it lacks the contributions from the berry curvatures  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the berry curvatures will modify the identifications of @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath26 with @xmath29 and thus introduce new terms into the kinetic equation .",
    "these new terms encode the axial anomaly into the kinetic equation and are responsible to the kinetic description of the cme and cse . however ,",
    "for our purpose , these berry curvature terms do not play a role because we will consider a plasma in a homogenous electric field with no external magnetic field being present .",
    "thus , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , all the berry curvature induced terms disappear .",
    "this illustrates that the cese , although arising only in p - odd environments , does not originate directly from the axial anomaly .    for demonstration of current generation in the linear response regime ,",
    "we consider the relaxation time approxiation , i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 the relaxation time for each specific species . here",
    "@xmath32 is the equilibrium distribution while the @xmath33 is the small deviation from equilibrium due to the externally applied fields .",

    "it is not difficult to see that a static and homogeneous solution in this case is given by : @xmath36 now one can compute the current generated .",

    ". however , on the other hand , @xmath0 is time - reversal odd because @xmath1 is time - reversal odd but @xmath16 is time - reversal even .",
    "this time - reversal oddness of @xmath0 suggests cese to be dissipative  @xcite .",
    "thus the dissipation property of cese is quite nontrivial and deserves a careful analysis .",

    "in this section , we compute the cese conductivity for qgp at very high temperature . in such temperature regime the qgp is weakly coupled and the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) approach provides a standard framework for calculating various transport coefficients , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we will extend such htl - based method to determine the cese conductivity in a very hot quark - gluon plasma with nonzero vector and axial chemical potentials .",
    "we consider the qgp in a general situation , with given temperature @xmath46 , @xmath53 vector chemical potential @xmath18 , and @xmath54 axial chemical potential @xmath12 .",

    "in summary , we have determined a new transport coefficient for the quark - gluon plasma at very high temperature .",

    "the perturbative result is first obtained here via kubo s formulae within the htl framework : @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again the cese is an anomalous transport effect that occurs in a parity - odd environment with nonzero axial charge density ( or equivalently axial chemical potential ) .",
    "it is also tempting to compare the perturbative results here with the strong coupling results obtained in certain holographic model  @xcite where it is found that @xmath116 with the coefficient @xmath117 . comparing numbers may not carry much meaning as the holographic model does not bear a direct correspondence to qgp .",

    "let us end with discussions pertinent to phenomenology of high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "firstly , it would be of great interest to extend such calculations to the temperature regime of few hundred @xmath121 , by e.g. employing certain nonperturbative effective models of qgp at those temperatures .",
    "secondly , it would be very useful to develop realistic simulations to estimate the axial charge transport and possible azimuthal charge distribution as signal in e.g. cu + au collisions at rhic , see the discussion in ref .",
    "the special distribution may be measured by using , e.g. , the two particle correlation @xmath122{\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "observation of a nonzero @xmath123 may indicate the occurrence of cese .",
    "lastly , one may wonder about possible analogy of cese in the case of a fluid field ( rather than the electric field ) : a plausible guess would be @xmath124 with @xmath27 the flow velocity but more investigation is needed to tell whether this is the case .",
