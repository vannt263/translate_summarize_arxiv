    "in recent years , the development of numerical methods for the approximation of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) has become a field of increasing interest , see .",
    "e.g @xcite and references therein . whereas strong approximation methods are designed to obtain good pathwise solutions @xcite , weak approximation focuses on the expectation of functionals of the solution .",
    "second order stochastic runge - kutta ( srk ) methods for the weak approximation of sdes were proposed by kloeden and platen @xcite , komori @xcite , mackevicius and navikas @xcite , tocino and vigo - aguiar @xcite , and the authors @xcite . however , these methods were not suitable for problems with high numbers @xmath0 of wiener processes , because for these methods the number of function evaluations per step increases quadratically in @xmath0 .",
    "recently , new classes of srk methods were introduced by rler @xcite which overcome this problem . in section [ sec : srk - methods ]",
    "we present the one of these classes which is suitable for it sdes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a full classification of all the explicit methods within this class with minimal stage number , which is done in section  [ sec : parameter - families ] . as an application , in section [ sec : optimal - schemes ]",
    "we extend the well known rk32 scheme @xcite to an srk method with minimized leading local error term .",
    "the performance of this method is illustrated by some numerical examples in section  [ sec : numerical - example ] .",
    "+   + we denote by @xmath1 the solution of the @xmath2-dimensional it sde defined by @xmath3 with an @xmath0-dimensional wiener process @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the borel - measurable coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy a lipschitz and a linear growth condition such that the existence and uniqueness theorem  @xcite applies . in the following ,",
    "let @xmath8 denote the @xmath9th column of the diffusion matrix @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "+   + let a discretization @xmath12 with @xmath13 of the time interval @xmath5 $ ] with step sizes @xmath14 for @xmath15 be given .",
    "further , define @xmath16 as the maximum step size .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the space of all @xmath18 fulfilling a polynomial growth condition and let @xmath19 if @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .    a time discrete approximation @xmath24 converges weakly with order @xmath25 to @xmath26 as @xmath27 at time @xmath28 if for each @xmath29 exist a constant @xmath30 and a finite @xmath31 such that @xmath32 holds for each @xmath330,\\delta_0[\\,$ ] .",
    "we consider the stochastic runge - kutta methods introduced in @xcite for the weak approximation of sde  ( [ st - lg - sde - ito-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2-dimensional approximation process @xmath34 with @xmath35 of an explicit @xmath36-stage srk method is defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath15 with stage values @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 with @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the vectors and matrices of coefficients of the srk method , @xmath49 for @xmath50 with a vector @xmath51 . in the following , the product of column vectors is defined component - wise .",
    "the coefficients of the srk method  ( [ srk - method - ito - wm - allg01 ] ) are determined by the following butcher tableau :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ) .,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ] ) .,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]",
    "in the present work , a full classification of the coefficients for a new class of efficient explicit srk methods of order @xmath52 for @xmath53 and order @xmath54 for @xmath55 stages as well as for order @xmath56 with @xmath57 stages is calculated .",
    "based on this classification , coefficients for an extension of the deterministic rk32 scheme to the stochastic case with minimized error constant are given . for three examples ,",
    "this scheme is finally compared with the order two platen and extrapolated euler scheme , the schemes rdi3wm and rdi4wm and non .",
    "it turns out that the new developed scheme performs very well and especially much better than all other schemes in the case of a high number of wiener processes .",
    "the authors are very grateful to the unknown referees for their comments and suggestions ."
