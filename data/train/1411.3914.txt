    "<S> this approach has several advantages . </S>",
    "<S> first , it provides improved precision due to the fact that the effective `` size '' of the system and output is now @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the observation time and @xmath1 is the system size . </S>",
    "<S> the second advantage arises from the fact that open systems can feature _ dynamical _ phase transitions ( dpts ) @xcite which , in contrast to static transitions , are characterised by singular changes in observables on the whole dynamical evolution and not just on the state of the system . we show that at a first - order dpt @xcite the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) of the system - and - output may become quadratic in @xmath12 giving rise to heisenberg scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we also clarify the behaviour away from the transition point . here </S>",
    "<S> heisenberg scaling of the qfi is present for times shorter than the correlation time of the dynamics , while asymptotically linear scaling is recovered . </S>",

    "<S> _ measurement schemes . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that near a dpt the system - output state can have a large qfi . but to exploit this , and achieve quantum enhanced sensitivity , it is necessary to measure an appropriately chosen observable . </S>",

    "<S> however , the measurement of @xmath18 will be difficult to engineer in most practical situations . </S>",
    "<S> one needs therefore to find an alternative which is both practical and whose snr is as close as possible to the qfi .    despite the fact that the intricacy of the optimal measurement makes it impractical </S>",
    "<S> , we can still formulate general characteristics for a measurement that achieves enhanced precision . </S>",
    "<S> the first consideration is whether the measurement should be on the system or output , or both . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the regime of enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the qfi involves measuring both system and output . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the precision achievable by measuring only the output is bounded by @xmath116 , which scales linearly in time . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath117 are the mps states associated to the individual active / inactive stationary states , and @xmath118 are their probabilities , see eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> this last result is the precision of an idealised protocol given by a first measurement of the system to project onto one of the subspaces associated with the competing stationary states , followed by an optimal measurement of the conditioned system - output state @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the second consideration is what should be the time extension @xmath12 of a single measurement run . </S>",
    "<S> here we imagine that the total time available to the experiment is @xmath119 and one performs @xmath120 independent repetitions of an efficient system - output measurement of the state @xmath121 . </S>",

    "<S> equation tells us that this optimal time is of the order of the correlation time , @xmath124 .    for the case of phase estimation at a dpt </S>",
    "<S> , the bimodality of the system - output state means that it is essentially of the form of a `` schrdinger cat '' state . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for simplicity that the competing stationary states are pure , it reads , @xmath125 where @xmath126 are coherent states with amplitudes @xmath127 , where @xmath128 are the photon emission rates of the phases , see eq .   and fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in fact , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the state is approximately a ghz state with relative phase @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for neither counting nor homodyne measurements achieve heisenberg scaling , which highlights the general challenge of identifying optimal measurements . </S>",
