    "since its inception by bennett and brassard in 1984 @xcite , quantum cryptography has made the transition from a concept to a technology mature enough for commercial development @xcite .",
    "there are several flavors of quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution .",
    "the initial formulation , and all current commercial systems implement so - called prepare and send ( pas ) protocols @xcite , where some degree of freedom of light is prepared by one party , alice , and sent to the other party , bob , who then measures it in one out of several complementary bases .",
    "estimation of the errors in the measurement results of the receiver allows both parties to place an upper bound on the knowledge of an eavesdropper , and is used for a subsequent removal of this knowledge in a privacy amplification step .",
    "another family of protocols evolved out of a proposal by ekert in 1991 ( e91 , @xcite ) .",
    "these protocols use entanglement as the main resource , and combine some of the measurements on the biphotons such that a bell inequality can be tested , or the state is tomographically estimated @xcite to evaluate the knowledge of an eavesdropper .",
    "an important development was an explicit way to calculate the amount of information leaked to an eavesdropper out of a less than perfect violation of a bell inequality @xcite , which makes it possible to implement this idea in a practical system with imperfect sources and measurement devices @xcite .",
    "these protocols reduce the assumptions about the physical implementation ( like e.g. the size of the hilbert space used to encode information ) in comparison with most pas qkd schemes .",
    "an entanglement - based bb84-type qkd scheme was described by bennett , brassard and mermin in 1992 ( bbm92 , @xcite ) . there , the prepare part of bb84 is replaced by a measurement scheme similar to the receiver side , but the knowledge of an eavesdropper is still evaluated from the observed errors .",
    "this results in a larger fraction of final key bits than under a full e91 protocol in its quantitative version @xcite , and probably maintains the insensitivity against an unknown size of the hilbert space , as long as the measurement devices can be trusted .",
    "furthermore , this scheme retrieves the randomness for the key used for encryption directly out of the measurement process on a quantum system , and does not need to provide for an active choice of a key bit .",
    "this qkd scheme has been demonstrated in the field @xcite using optical fiber links without amplifiers or signal regeneration stages . if the link is to be established _",
    "ad hoc _ , e.g. in a mobile environment , or it is not feasible to have a fiber deployed ( e.g. in the satellite qkd proposals @xcite ) , propagation of the photons through free space is necessary .",
    "a free space transmission channel using polarization encoding of the qubits has the advantage of not inducing decoherence ( negligible birefringence of air ) , and has low absorption under clear weather conditions .",
    "so far , such entanglement based qkd systems over free space have been demonstrated at night , taking advantage of low background light levels @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate daylight operation of a qkd system implementing a bbm92 protocol .",
    "continuous operation over a full day / night cycle brings free space entanglement based qkd one step closer to the stage of development of free space pas protocols , where such daylight operation has been shown @xcite .",
    "the main challenge for operating over a free space channel in daylight is to handle the high background from the sun .",
    "first , actively quenched avalanche photodiode ( apd ) detectors may be subject to irreversible destruction when exposed to an excessive amount of light ; such a situation may occur if there is excessive scattering in the optical communication link . for passively quenched apds",
    "this is not a problem , since the electrical power deposited into the device can be limited to a safe operation regime at all times .",
    "second , saturation of detectors leads to a reduced probability of detecting photons at high light levels .",
    "this effect can usually be modeled by a dead time @xmath0 or recovery time for the device . for passively quenched apds ,",
    "this time is about @xmath1s , but may be over an order of magnitude smaller for actively quenched devices .",
    "while modeling the saturation with a single dead time @xmath0 may not completely reflect the details of the re - arming of a detector , it gives a useful estimation of the fraction of time a detector can register photoevents . given an initial photoevent rate @xmath2 ( i.e. , the rate a detector with no recovery time would report ) , a detector with dead time @xmath0 will register a rate of    @xmath3    third , a high background level will lead to detection events which are mistaken with the detection of a photon pair .",
    "these are uncorrelated in their polarization and lead to an increase in the quantum bit error ratio ( qber ) , which is used to establish a bound for the knowledge of an eavesdropper . in the following",
    ", we estimate the operational limit for generating a useful key under such conditions , assuming an implementation of a symmetrical bbm92 protocol , i.e. , both complementary measurement bases are chosen with an equal probability of 50% on both measurement units .    assuming that all quoted rates already include detector efficiencies , we can characterize a pair source by its single event rates , @xmath4 , and its coincidence rate @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the transmission of the entire optical channel as @xmath6 , in which we include absorptive losses in optical components , the air , geometrical losses due to imperfect mode transfer from an optical fiber , and losses in spatial filters .",
    "the signal or raw key rate for a symmetric bbm92 protocol is given by half of the detected coincidence rate , @xmath7    for an external background event rate @xmath8 , a coincidence time interval of @xmath9 , and assuming no correlations between source and background events , the accidental coincidence rate with matching bases is given by @xmath10    assuming that only one of the detectors , here with index 2 , is exposed to the background events .",
    "imperfections in practical entangled photon pair source and the detector projection errors are often characterized by visibilities of polarization correlations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the intrinsic qber @xmath13 of the qkd system with a symmetric usage of both bases is given by    @xmath14    the polarization of background events on one side can be assumed to be uncorrelated the photons detected in the other arm , thus the qber due to accidentally identified coincidences is @xmath15 .",
    "the total qber @xmath16 of the complete ensemble is given by the weighted average over both components , @xmath17    the detector saturation modifies both signal and accidental rates similarly to equation ( [ eq : saturation ] ) by the same dead time correction factor @xmath18 , where we assume an equal distribution of photoevents over all four detectors , resulting in a dead time constant of @xmath19 :    @xmath20    therefore , the resulting qber @xmath16 in equation ( [ eq : qbertot ] ) does not get affected .",
    "however , the signal rate does , leading to the modified expression    @xmath21    for typical parameters in our experiment ( @xmath22=78kcps , @xmath23=71kcps , @xmath24=11kcps , @xmath25s , @xmath6=15% , @xmath13=4.3% , @xmath9=2ns ) , the total detector rate @xmath26 on the receiver side , the available raw key bit rate @xmath27 and the resulting qber @xmath16 are plotted as a function of an external background rate @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : saturation ] . above a certain background rate , @xmath16 would exceed the limit of 11% for which a secret key can be established for individual attack schemes @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the excess qber due to background events :    @xmath28    in a parameter regime useful for key generation , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and for simplicity assuming @xmath31 , this quantity can be approximated by    @xmath32    while the source property @xmath33 and the channel transmission @xmath6 are typically optimized already , the only way to reduce the excess error @xmath34 is to reduce the background rate @xmath8 and the coincidence time window @xmath9 .",
    "the limitation on reducing @xmath35 is the timing jitter of all detectors , which in our case is on the order of a nanosecond .",
    "emphasis thus has to be drawn to reduce the background rate @xmath8 .",
    "we prepare the polarization - entangled photon pairs in a source based on type - ii parametric down conversion ( pdc ) in a non - collinear configuration @xcite .",
    "it is pumped with a cw free - running diode laser with power of 30mw and a center wavelength of 407 nm , producing pairs at a degenerate wavelength around 814  nm ( similar to @xcite ) in single mode fibers . when directly connected to single photon detectors",
    ", we typically observe single rate per arm of 78kcps and 71kcps , with a coincidence rate of 12kcps .",
    "the visibility of polarization correlations in the hv and @xmath36 basis are @xmath37% and @xmath38% , respectively .",
    "while these sources have been substantially surpassed in quality and brightness @xcite , this particular device is both simple and robust .",
    "the minimal incident angle @xmath39 of the sun and the line of sight was about @xmath40 .",
    "as endpoints in our transmission channel , we use a pair of custom telescopes to transmit one member of the entangled photon pair across a distance of 350 m for convenient logistics .",
    "the relative orientation of both telescopes is adjusted using manual tip / tilt stages with an angular resolution of @xmath4110@xmath42rad , mounted on tripods intended for mobile satellite links .",
    "the telescopes are not actively stabilized , but this could be added for spanning larger distances , or to compensate for thermal drifts in the mounting stages @xcite .",
    "similarly to @xcite , the sending telescope consists of fiber port , a small achromat with @xmath43 mm to reduce the effective numerical - aperture of the single mode fiber , and a main achromat with @xmath44 mm and 75 mm diameter , transforming the optical mode of the fiber to a collimated gaussian beam with a waist parameter of 20 mm .",
    "nominally this results in a rayleigh length of 1.6 km at our operation wavelength , well above our target distance .    a combination of spectral , spatial and temporal filtering is used to reduce the background to tolerable levels . at the receiving end , an identical @xmath44 mm achromat as the front lens focuses the incoming light onto a pinhole of 30@xmath42 m diameter at its focal position for spatial filtering .",
    "assuming diffraction - limited performance of that lens , this corresponds to a solid angle of @xmath45sr .",
    "the pinhole is then imaged with a magnification of 6.8 through an interference filter onto the passively quenched silicon avalanche detectors with an active diameter of 500@xmath42 m in a compact module that performs passively the random basis selection for the measurement @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "our pair source has a measured spectral width of 8.7 nm , given by the phase matching conditions , and the geometry of the collection @xcite .",
    "an interference filter with a peak transmission of 72% and a full width at half - maximum of 6.7 nm was chosen to maximize the amount of signal transmitted and eliminate the background outside of the spectral region of the source ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "this filter reduces the ambient background level by about two orders of magnitude , much less than what can be achieved in pas experiments based on extremely narrow band lasers and matching spectral filters .",
    "a significant reduction of background events was also achieved addressing scattering from various elements in the field - of - view ( fov ) of the detector , and from scatterers close to the optical channel ( see figure  [ fig : telescopes ] ) .",
    "reduction of the fov with a smaller pinhole is finally limited by diffraction ; we found a 30@xmath42 m pinhole to be the optimal choice when considering pointing accuracy and signal transmission .",
    "this corresponds to a fov of @xmath46 mm diameter for our test range which will strongly contribute to daylight background counts .",
    "a circular area with a diameter of about 3 fov as well as the inside of the sending telescope is covered with low scattering blackout material .",
    "the blackout area was also shielded against direct sunlight .",
    "together , these steps reduce the background by about 12db . a set of apertures at the receiver telescope",
    "removes light coupled to the detector by multiple reflections from outside the line - of - sight .",
    "five concentric apertures extending 30 cm upstream , and seven apertures with tapered diameters downstream of the main receiver lens matched the receiving mode and reduced the background by about 3 - 4db .",
    "the processing of detection events into a final key has been described in @xcite and the software is available as open source @xcite .",
    "each detector event results in a nim pulse which is sent to a custom timestamp unit with a nominal resolution of 125ps , referenced to a local rb oscillator .",
    "our time stamp units exhibit a dead time of 128ns , and are able to transfer up to @xmath47 events per second to a commodity host pc via a usb connection .",
    "the timing information on one of the sides is then losslessly encoded as differences between consecutive events with an adaptive resolution , and together with the basis information sent to the other side on a classical channel , in our case over a standard wireless tcp / ip connection .",
    "the encoding , together with a small overhead , consumes about 13% more bandwidth than necessary due to the shannon limit . to minimize the bandwidth for this communication",
    ", the timing information was sent from the source side with lower overall detection rate during daylight conditions .    to identify corresponding photon pair events , the temporal correlation of the two photons generated in the pdc process",
    "is used @xcite , with a coincidence time window determined by the combined timing jitter from both photodetector sets , the timestamp electronics , and the time difference servoing .    for that process to work ,",
    "an initial time difference between the two receiver units due to different timing origins and light propagation is determined to a resolution of 2ns using a tiered cross correlation technique on a set of detector events acquired over @xmath48 seconds .",
    "once that time difference is established , coincidences are identified within a time window of @xmath49ns .",
    "its center drift due to residual frequency differences between the two reference clocks is tracked with a servo loop with an integration time constant of 2s for events falling in a time window @xmath50ns around the expected center for coincidence events .",
    "we were able to resynchronize the system during daylight conditions at a coincidence rate of 1500cps up to an ambient light level of 250kcps , well below saturation of the detectors .    to maintain a common time frame when no useful signal is available for servoing , one of the clock frequencies",
    "was manually adjusted such that the relative frequency difference was @xmath51 .",
    "this would allow a loss of signal over a period of two hours without loss of timing lock .",
    "again , the tight time correlation of the photon pairs emerging in pdc acts as a natural way of comparing differences and synchronizing clocks at a distance easily . the ability to resynchronize during daytime and the use of the pdc signal for mutual calibration of the clocks makes this system very robust against signal interruptions or temporal unavailability of the channel .    in the discussion of temporal",
    "filtering we have assumed that all detectors on one side have the same relative lag , or more generally , that their temporal response is identical . this detector equivalence is not guaranteed , and is necessary for an efficient time filtering and , more importantly , to prevent information leakage to an eavesdropper @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : histos ] shows the measured time differences between those pairs of detector combinations which contribute to the key generation .",
    "the figure shows that detectors from the same basis are well matched , but there is significant difference between the two bases .",
    "given our detector assignment , the information leakage is 0.52% and 0.44% in the hv and @xmath52 basis , respectively . for continuously pumped sources , extraction of timing information by an eavesdropper would need a measurement of the presence of a photon in the communication channel without disturbing the polarization state ; with pulsed sources , however , the problem becomes more acute , as the pulse train provides a clock with which to compare the publicly exchanged timing information .",
    "the experiment was run continuously over a period from 9.11.2008 , 18:00 sgt to 14.11.2008 , 2:00 sgt over four consecutive days . in this period",
    "we saw extremely bright sunlight , tropical thunderstorms and partly cloudy weather ; over the whole period the rate of detected pairs and background events varied by about 2 orders of magnitude . in figure  [ fig:24hrs ] we show the results collected over two consecutive days . on the second day we identified @xmath53 raw coincidences . after sifting ,",
    "this resulted in @xmath54 of raw uncorrected bits , with a total of @xmath55 errors corrected using a modified cascade protocol @xcite , which was carried out over blocks of at least 5000 bits to a target bit error ratio of @xmath56 .    for the privacy amplification step ,",
    "we arrive at a knowledge of an eavesdropper on the error - corrected raw key determined by ( a ) the actual information revealed in the error correction process , and ( b ) the asymptotic ( i.e. assuming infinite key length ) expression for the eavesdropping knowledge inferred from the actually observed qber @xmath57 , @xmath58 of an equivalent true single photon bb84 protocol .",
    "privacy amplification itself is carried out by binary multiplication / addition of blocks of raw key vectors with a length of at least 5000 bits with a rectangular matrix filled with a pseudorandom balanced bit stream from a 32 bit linear - feedback shift register , seeded with a number from a high - entropy source for each block .",
    "we are left with @xmath59 of secure bits for this 24 hour period , corresponding to an average key generation rate of 385 bits per second ( bps ) . in these conditions ,",
    "the key generation rates are far from uniform during the acquisition period ; we see a maximum secure key generation rate of 533bps in darkness and a minimum of 29bps around noon in rainy conditions .",
    "the raw key compression ratio in the privacy amplification step should actually also take care of a limited entropy in the raw key due to part - to - part variation in detector efficiencies .",
    "this information was obtained before the main key generation process by establishing the complete correlation matrix ( see table [ tab1 ] ) out of an ensemble of 148493 coincidence events with matching bases .",
    ".correlation events between each of the four detectors on both sides [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the asymmetry between 0 and 1 results in the hv basis is @xmath60 , and in the @xmath61 basis @xmath62 . using again entropy as a simple measure of information leakage , this detector asymmetry would allow an eavesdropper to obtain 0.45% of the raw key for events in the hv basis , and 0.18% in the @xmath61 basis . at the moment , however , it is not obvious that a simple reduction of the final key size in the privacy amplification step due to various information leakage channels would be sufficient to ensure that the eavesdropper has no access to any elements of the final key .",
    "we also note that the choice between the two measurement bases is not completely balanced ; the ratio of hv vs. @xmath36 coincidences is @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , this asymmetry varies over time . for the combined asymmetry between logical 0 and 1 bits in the raw key we find around 51.5% during night time , and 54.0% during daytime .",
    "a system which captures this variability in detection efficiencies ( and also would allow to discover selective detector blinding attacks ) would have to monitor this asymmetry continuously .    as introduced in section [ chap : theory ] we can estimate how well the experiment performs for a given number of background events .",
    "figure  [ fig : saturation ] shows theoretical values for background- and signal rates according to equations ( [ eq : qbertot ] ) and ( [ eqn : rs ] ) , and experimental data for the 25000 recorded outputs of the error correction module during the two days of the experiment .",
    "the dead - time affected detector response is also shown assuming @xmath64s .",
    "the night time periods with @xmath65kcps and a total dark count rate of 7kcps contribute to events on the low background regime of the experiment forming a vertical line to the left of figure  [ fig : saturation ]",
    ". we can not differentiate between fluctuations due to changes in the source and those in the transmission channel , but since the source itself was protected against thermal fluctuations , we attribute them to variations in transmission @xmath6 due to changes in the coupling of the telescopes .",
    "the strongly fluctuating background during daytime contributes to the broadly scattered data between @xmath8 = 20 and 500kcps .",
    "if the source properties and channel coupling were constant , the deviation of @xmath66 and @xmath67 from the theoretical value would be both randomly distributed .",
    "figure  [ fig : saturation ] , however , shows more structure in @xmath67 than in @xmath16 which we attribute to changes in the coupling between the telescopes due to thermal expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental values fit the theoretical prediction well .",
    "we note that saturation of the detectors is never a problem .     for parameters representative for our experiment :",
    "the _ detected _ background rate @xmath68 shows saturation , due to the intrinsic dead time of the four detectors .",
    "less counts are detected for higher count rates . the observed background rate increases up to @xmath41 450kcps , which leads also to a reduction of the sifted key rate , @xmath67 , by 20% and an increase of the resulting qber @xmath16 up to 6.5% .",
    "the efficient filtering of the ambient light prevents a higher background , which would lead to an increase of the qber above the threshold of 11% where no private key can be established between the two parties at a count rate of 1.8@xmath69cps .",
    "this threshold is not reached during the whole experiment , thus continuous operation is possible when the coupling between the parties is maintained . ]",
    "there are two contributors to the variability in key generation rate : first , atmospheric conditions such as rainfall reduce the transmission and thus the number of raw key events before the error correction and privacy amplification steps , but the qber remains unchanged .",
    "on the other hand we have extremely bright conditions where accidental coincidences increase significantly . in this regime , as the background rises , the signal rate is reduced due to the dead time of the detectors .",
    "furthermore , the qber increases according to equation  ( [ eq : qbertot ] ) , occasionally preventing the generation of a secure key @xcite .",
    "but even under bright conditions , the system still keeps track of the time drift between the two reference clocks with the time - correlated coincidences from the source without a need for re - synchronization .",
    "we have demonstrated the continuous running of a free space entanglement qkd system over several full day - night cycles in variable weather conditions . a combination of filtering techniques is used to overcome the highly variable illumination and transmission conditions .",
    "the software and synchronization scheme can tolerate the remaining 16db variation in light levels without interruption of the key generation .",
    "we continuously generate error corrected , privacy amplified key at an average rate of 385bps . with",
    "the newly available bright sources larger distances and/or a higher key generation rates are possible ."
