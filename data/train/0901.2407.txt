    "consequences of the @xmath0 restoration have been investigated if the restoration is associated with the chiral transition @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the instanton liquid model , it was speculated that drastic @xmath0 restoration at the chiral transition could be expected because the chiral transition is caused by the rearrangement of the instanton configurations in that model .",

    "@xcite , where the topological susceptibility @xmath6 , a correlator of topological charges , was considered . in the large @xmath7 ( number of colors ) limit , @xmath6 is related to the @xmath2 mass through the witten - veneziano mass formula @xcite , @xmath8 , so it can be used to probe the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "the njl model calculation @xcite reproduced the lattice data @xcite above the critical temperature up to 1.5 times the chiral phase transition temperature with temperature independent t hooft coupling constant .",

    "the medium response of the @xmath0 anomaly is even less understood , largely because of the lack of lattice data due to the fermion sign problem @xcite .",

    "we will just focus on the light quark region .    at @xmath15 , the physical point of quark masses",
    "is located in the crossover region , meaning that qcd has a crossover at @xmath15 .",
    "if the cep exists at finite @xmath1 , then the physical point should enter the first order phase transition region at finite @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite , it was found that near @xmath15 , the region of the first order phase transition shrinks as @xmath1  increases .",

    ".    given that lattice computations at higher @xmath1  are still challenging , it is our hope that model calculations might shed light on this problem .    inspired by the fact that the @xmath0  anomaly could induce the first order transition in massless three - flavor qcd",

    ", the absence of the @xmath0  anomaly leads to the disappearance of the first order transition .    for simplicity",
    "let us assume an ( unphysical ) extreme case that the @xmath1 dependence lies only in the anomaly term @xmath44 and @xmath39 at @xmath45 .",
    "then as we go from @xmath46 to higher @xmath47 on the @xmath47 axis , the strength of the first order transition gets weakened . at @xmath48 ,",
    "the first order transition disappears completely , and above @xmath49 , the transition turns into second order .",
    "however , if fluctuations are taken into account , the above mean - field picture is modified .",
    "the second order transition above @xmath50 has the @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "the renormalization group analysis tells us that there is no infrared stable fixed point for this universality class @xcite .",
    "this means that the fluctuations wash out the critical point and make it a fluctuation induced first order transition .",
    "thus , at @xmath16 , the transition remains first order on the @xmath1  axis even if the @xmath0 symmetry is restored .",
    "this implies that as we go to @xmath49 , the first order region around @xmath16 would ever shrink , but the critical surface can never touch the @xmath1 axis but only approaches it asymptotically .",
    "the above discussion gives a clear picture about the eventual shrinking of the first order region if @xmath0  is completely restored above a certain @xmath1 ( if terms higher order than eq .",
    "( [ gl2 ] ) can be neglected ) . for partial restoration with the gl coefficients depending on @xmath1 ,",
    "the eventual shrinking does not have to happen .",

    "( [ gap ] ) .",
    "if @xmath44  decreases , @xmath52can still increase if the parameter @xmath41 ( or @xmath53 ) decreases sufficiently fast .",
    "this means that even if the @xmath0  symmetry is partially restored when @xmath1  increases , the first order region may still expand .",
    "in fact , this is confirmed in the njl calculation in the next section .",
    "in contrast , even without the @xmath0  symmetry restoration , the critical surface can still shrink if @xmath41 or @xmath53 increases due to some mechanism .",
    "this is similar to what happens if a repulsive interaction between  vector currents is added to the njl model , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "thus , the @xmath0  restoration is just one possible explanation to the shrinkage of the first order region at small @xmath1 .",

    "this raises the possibility that despite the shrinking of the first order region at lower @xmath129 , the qcd critical end point might still exist due to the expansion at higher @xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "very high precision lattice data will be needed to detect the back - bending of the critical surface with the currently available analytic continuation or taylor expansion approaches .",
    "finally , since the @xmath130 mass and the topological susceptibility are sensitive to the strength of the @xmath0 anomaly , lattice computations of these quantities at small @xmath47 could check whether the strength of the @xmath0 anomaly is reduced when @xmath47 is increased .",
    "these calculations , however , have to be carried out using either imaginary chemical potential or derivative expansions due to the fermion sign problem with finite @xmath47 .",
