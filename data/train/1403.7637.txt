    "effects of simple inorganic salts on the molecular properties of water are at the heart of a vast number of interesting and complex processes such as the stability of proteins and nucleic acids  @xcite and environmentally relevant processes  @xcite . understanding the effect of dissolved ions on the structural and dynamical properties of water is essential in this regard . the hofmeister effect , which includes highly ion - specific effects on aggregation dynamics of proteins  @xcite and other biologically relevant processes  @xcite has been of significant interest lately .",
    "spectroscopic techniques have been instrumental in probing the cooperative ion hydration mechanism and consequent long - range structural and dynamical effects of certain salts , or ion combinations , on water  @xcite .",

    "two sub - populations of water molecules were identified for various salts : one with reorientation timescales comparable to pure water ( @xmath22.6 ps ) and the other showing characteristically slower reorientations ( @xmath210 ps ) .",
    "the fraction of total water molecules contributing to the sub - population of slow - water molecules was seen to increase with increase in salt concentration for all salts and the magnitude of increase was observed to be highly dependent on ion combinations : being largest for combinations of strongly hydrated ion species ( mg@xmath3 , so@xmath4 ) .    despite the recent experimental results  @xcite , the existence of long - range temporal effects of salts , beyond first hydration shell , is controversial owing to results from other experimental  @xcite as well as simulation  @xcite studies which suggest the contrary .",
    "while an intense cooperative slowdown of water reorientation has been observed in presence of ions with high charge densities , the range of presence of slow water molecules has been found to be confined to the first hydration shell of the ions  @xcite .",
