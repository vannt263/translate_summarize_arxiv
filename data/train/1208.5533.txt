    "long - lived charged massive particles ( champ ) are predicted in new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "such long - lived champs induce nonstandard nuclear reactions in big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and drastically change light element abundances  @xcite . by comparing the theoretical predictions with observational data ,",
    "we can obtain constraints on model parameters relevant with the long - lived champs . because the bbn is sensitive to lifetime from @xmath7  sec to @xmath8  sec",
    ", it should be one of the best tools to check an existence of the long - lived champs .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with r - parity conservation is one of the leading candidate providing long - lived champs .",
    "several mssm scenarios predict a long - lived stau as the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "an example is the scenario that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is gravitino . in this scenario ,",
    "the interaction of the gravitino lsp with the stau nlsp is suppressed by planck scale , and hence the stau has longevity  @xcite .",
    "another example is an axino lsp scenario , in which the decay rate of the stau nlsp is suppressed because of loop processes or a decay constant scale @xmath9  @xcite . among such scenarios ,",
    "the most attractive one is a bino - like neutralino lsp scenario .",
    "the longevity of the stau nlsp is brought by tight mass degeneracy of the stau and the neutralino lsp .",
    "a remarkable feature of this mass - degenerate scenario is to be free from the @xmath0li problem @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0li problem is a discrepancy between the observed abundance of @xmath0li , e.g. , @xmath10",
    "@xcite , and a theoretical one predicted in the standard bbn , @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "( there is also a severer observational limit which worsens the fitting  @xcite . ) in order to explain the observed abundance of the dark matter by the bino - like neutralino lsp based on a thermal relic scenario , the so - called stau coannihilation mechanism is required to work well  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism requires of order or smaller than @xmath12 degeneracy in mass between the neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp . due to this tight degeneracy",
    ", the stau can be long - lived @xcite and trigger exotic nuclear reactions at the bbn era .",
    "one of such exotic reactions is an internal conversion process in a bound state of the stau and @xmath0li ( @xmath0be ) nuclei  @xcite . in the internal conversion process",
    ", @xmath0li ( @xmath0be ) can be destroyed into lighter nuclei and their abundances are fitted to the observational ones .",
    "therefore , in the mass - degenerate scenario , the observed abundances of the dark matter and all light elements are simultaneously realized .",
    "it is further worth examining the bbn in the mass - degenerate scenario . in general , the mssm has sources of intergenerational mixing , though we had assumed the lepton flavor conservation in our previous works . with the intergenerational mixing ,",
    "the mass eigenstates are linear combinations of flavor eigenstates .",
    "as we will discuss later in detail , the intergenerational mixing reduces the number density of the slepton via two types of processes . success and failure of solving the @xmath0li problem",
    "strongly depends on the number density of the slepton .",
    "furthermore , major and minor of modifications on the light element abundances are also determined by the number density of the slepton .",
    "thus , the modified abundances of the light elements can be predicted by the number density that is a function of mixing parameters . as a result , we can constrain the mixing parameters from the consistency between the modified and the observed abundances of the light elements .",
    "the aim of this work is to predict the slepton mixing parameters in the mass - degenerate scenario . in this scenario ,",
    "the exotic nuclear reactions catalyzed by the long - lived slepton induce both a fusion process  @xcite and destruction processes through internal conversions for @xmath13li and @xmath13be  @xcite , and spallations for @xmath14he  @xcite .",
    "these processes can modify the abundance of the light elements .",
    "in fact , @xmath1li is produced via the former process after forming a bound state of the slepton with @xmath15he .",
    "a fit by the observational abundance @xmath1li/@xmath0li",
    "@xmath16  @xcite gives an allowed region in a parameter space of the mixing parameters .",
    "in addition , both deuterium ( d ) and tritium ( t ) ( or @xmath17he after its decay ) are produced nonthermally by the latter processes . by adopting recent observational constraints",
    "d / h = @xmath18  @xcite and @xmath17he / d @xmath19 0.87 + 0.27  @xcite , an upper bound on the number density of the slepton is obtained as a function of its lifetime .",
    "thus , the upper bound on the number density results in a lower bounds on the mixing parameters of the slepton . on the other hand , a sufficient number density of the slepton at the bound state formation with @xmath0li ( @xmath0be ) is required for solving the @xmath0li problem .",
    "then , an upper bound on the mixing parameters is obtained .",
    "hence , intriguingly , the mixing parameters of the slepton are predicted with pinpoint accuracy from both above and below in light of the current observed light element abundances .",
    "this long - lived slepton scenario can be also examined at terrestrial experiments .",
    "for example , due to the longevity longer than _  the first three minutes of the universe \" _ , a small number of the long - lived slepton would decay in detectors  .",
    "some of them decay into the neutralino lsp and electron ( or muon ) via the intergenerational mixing . combined with the predictions on the mixing parameters using the light element abundances , we find monochromatic and diffuse spectrum in momentum distributions of the final electron ( or muon ) .",
    "these spectrum are characteristic signatures of the mass - degenerate scenarios , and therefore we can distinguish our scenario from others .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the number density of the long - lived slepton and the intergenerational mixing in the mass - degenerate scenarios .",
    "then , we present a set of boltzmann equations for calculating the number density as a function of the mixing parameters . in sec .  [ sec : ana ] , we analytically estimate bounds on the mixing parameters .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show our numerical results . allowed region on the intergenerational mixing parameter",
    "is shown from the viewpoint of observed light element abundances . in sec .",
    "[ sec : col ] , applying the results , we discuss collider implications of this long - lived slepton . finally , we summarize our results and discuss the prospects .",
    "long - lived slepton leads some kinds of exotic nuclear reactions and changes light element abundances .",
    "predicted light element abundances depend on the number density of the slepton at the bbn epoch .",
    "interestingly , the number density is quite sensitive to the intergenerational mixing parameters of the slepton in the mass - degenerate scenarios .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain the intergenerational mixing , the number density has to be accurately calculated as a function of the intergenerational parameters .",
    "a calculation of the number density of the slepton consists of two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the total number density of susy particles is calculated at a time of their chemical decoupling .",
    "after the chemical decoupling , the number density of the slepton continues to evolve till the temperature @xmath20 via scattering off the cosmic thermal background .",
    "here @xmath21 is the mass difference between the slepton nlsp and the lightest neutralino lsp .",
    "furthermore the number of the slepton is reduced by its own natural decay . then ,",
    "as the second step , the evolution of the number density is acquired by solving relevant boltzmann equations implementing the scatterings and the decays .",
    "we explain the calculation of the number density , and then present a set of boltzmann equations for the calculation .      as the first step ,",
    "we calculate the total number density of susy particles .",
    "the total number density is equal to the relic number density of the neutralino dark matter in the current universe because all susy particles decay into the neutralino lsp in the end under the r - parity conservation .",
    "calculation of the relic density of the neutralino dark matter in the stau - neutralino coannihilation scenario has been developed so far  @xcite .",
    "assuming the intergenerational mixing is not so large and the main component of the slepton is stau , the calculation method is applicable for our calculation .",
    "that is , cross sections of coannihilation processes are firstly calculated , and then we solve the boltzmann equations for sum of the number densities of susy particles .",
    "after the chemical decoupling , the total number density of susyparticles remains the value at the freeze out .",
    "this value does not have correlation with the intergenerational mixing .",
    "this value is required as the initial condition for calculating the slepton number density as a function of the intergenerational mixing .      [ !",
    "t ]     for @xmath22gev and @xmath23 .",
    "solid line is the lifetime of the pure stau , and others are the lifetime of slepton with each intergenerational mixing parameters . , width=321 ]    a key ingredient for constraining the mixing parameters is the evolution of the number density of the slepton after the chemical decoupling of susy particles .",
    "thermally - produced slepton decays according to its lifetime after the chemical decoupling .",
    "hereafter we assume that the mass difference @xmath21 is smaller than the mass of tau lepton .",
    "in this situation , the decay of slepton into the neutralino lsp and a tau lepton are forbidden kinematically . in this case",
    "the slepton becomes long - lived @xcite .",
    "the decay of the slepton is categorized into two types .",
    "the first one is 3- or 4-body final state processes through the stau component ; @xmath24 in the mass - degenerate scenario , the decay rates of these modes considerably depend on @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] on this work and fig.2 in ref .",
    "the second one is 2-body final state processes through the selectron or smuon component ; @xmath25 the 2-body decay process are dominant when the mixing parameters are not very small so that the decay rates are larger than those of 3- and 4-body decays . on the contrary ,",
    "when the intergenerational mixing is tiny , 3- or 4-body decay processes dominate over 2-body decay processes in spite of a tight kinematical suppression .",
    "the constraint on the mixing from these decay processes must be therefore studied carefully as both functions of @xmath21 and the mixing parameters .",
    "exchange processes by scattering off the thermal background also play an important role in constraining on the mixing parameters . even after the chemical decoupling of susy particles ,",
    "the ratio of the number density of the slepton to the neutralino continues to evolve via exchange processes , @xmath26 note that the process @xmath27 must not be included .",
    "the decay mode @xmath28 is always open in the presence of the intergenerational mixing , and the process @xmath29 should be counted as one of the corrective part for this decay ( or inverse decay ) mode with soft emission ( or absorption ) .",
    "thus , including the process @xmath30 in addition to this decay mode results in a double counting .",
    "similarly , when the mode @xmath31 is open , then the corresponding exchange process @xmath32 also must be taken out .",
    "these exchange processes keep the slepton and the neutralino in kinematical equilibrium . due to this kinematical equilibrium ,",
    "the number density ratio between the slepton and the neutralino maintain the boltzmann distributions .",
    "the number density of the slepton for a fixed @xmath21 therefore decreases as the temperature of the universe decreases ; @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the temperature , and @xmath35 is a sum of the densities of the slepton and the neutralino that are obtained in the first step ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : tot ] ) .",
    "the kinematical equilibrium is broken when the hubble expansion rate overwhelms the reaction rate of the exchange processes .",
    "hence it is important to know when the hubble expansion rate overwhelms the reaction rate .",
    "we numerically solve a set of boltzmann equations to obtain accurate resultant number density of the slepton .",

    "the first requirement is the sufficient longevity of the slepton , and the second one is the sufficient number density at the moment of decoupling from the exchange processes .",
    "for the first requirement , the lifetime of the slepton must be longer than @xmath59 to solve the @xmath0li problem .",
    "the slepton with this lifetime can form a bound state with @xmath0li and @xmath0be and destroy these nuclei via the internal conversion processes  @xcite .",

    "both @xmath2 and @xmath56 is different for @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the lifetime should be studied in each @xmath21 region to obtain bounds on the mixing parameters .",
    "we can derive another upper bounds on the mixing parameters from the second requirement that the number density should be sufficient at the decoupling time from the exchange processes to destroy the @xmath0li and @xmath0be nuclei .",

    "the former exchange process keeps working even after the freeze out of the latter process .",
    "this is because densities of electron and photon are still quite large in thermal bath for @xmath80 .",
    "then , as explained in the previous section , the slepton number density continues to decrease .",
    "the reaction rate with the electron is proportional to @xmath81 .",

    "the reaction rate of @xmath82 must be suppressed to ensure a sufficient number density of the slepton .",

    "mixing or pure stau case , freeze out of the exchange processes ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) occurs at @xmath85mev , and is almost independent of both @xmath21 and @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "then the number density of the slepton manages to be a sufficient amount .",
    "this fact suggests that the reaction rate of @xmath87 must be smaller than that of the processes in the absence of the intergenerational mixing at @xmath88mev .",

    "the region on the bottom - left side of thick dotted line is free from @xmath13li problem at 3@xmath122 , and the region on the other side of the line is excluded due to insufficient density of the slepton .",

    "the @xmath14he spallation processes exclude shadowed , light shadowed , and dark shadowed regions due to over - productions of d / h , @xmath17he / d , and @xmath13li / h at 2@xmath122 , respectively .",
    "the region on the bottom - left side of left blue solid line is excluded by @xmath121li over - production .",

    "[ ! t ]     events in a bin.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +   events in a bin.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    finally , we have a short discussion on collider signatures of the long - lived slepton .",
    "the long - lived sleptons stopped in a detector decay into 2-body final state ( @xmath138 ) and 4-body final state ( @xmath139 ) . from the results in previous section",
    ", we can predict the ratio of the number of events between these decays .",
    "one of the way to confirm our scenario is to search for double peaks in electron momentum distribution in the decay of the long - lived slepton , and count the event number ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : decay_dist ] shows expected event distributions of the decay as a function of electron momentum .",
    "the event distributions of both 2-body and 4-body decays are plotted in log scale in top panel , and bottom panel plots the distribution of only 4-body decay in linear scale .",
    "we took @xmath140gev , @xmath141gev , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "this parameter set is found in allowed region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ce ] ) .",
    "we assumed detector resolution to be 1mev , and normalized number of 2-body decay to @xmath144 events in a bin .",
    "one can see in the top panel that there is a peak at the momentum of @xmath145gev .",
    "the peak corresponds to 2-body decay because the momentum is the same value of @xmath21 . on the other hand , in the bottom panel",
    ", one can see that 4-body decay also shows a peak around @xmath146 gev .",
    "this peak is broader than that of the 2-body decay .",
    "number of event of 2-body decay is almost 100 times more than peak number of 4-body decay .",
    "thus , the event distribution shows a double peak structure , and this is a characteristic feature for mass - degenerate scenario .",
    "we have considered a scenario of the mssm where the slepton nlsp is long - lived due to a small mass difference between the nlsp and the neutralino lsp , and studied the effects of the intergenerational mixing of sleptons on big - bang nucleosynthesis . in this scenario ,",
    "the so - called internal conversion processes occurs in the bound states between the slepton nlsp and light nuclei in bbn .",
    "then , the @xmath0li and @xmath1li problems can be solved simultaneously when the slepton nlsp is enough long - lived and its number density is sufficient at the era of bbn .",
    "we have analyzed the yield value and the lifetime of the slepton with the intergenerational mixing as well as the relic abundances of the light elements including the internal conversion processes in bbn .    in sec .",
    "iii , we have calculated the yield value and the lifetime of the slepton nlsp and derived upper bounds on the mixing parameters @xmath56 .",
    "the upper bounds are obtained by requiring the yield value and the lifetime to be @xmath147 and @xmath148 sec . to solve the @xmath0li problem . in the case of @xmath63 ,",
    "the upper bounds are given as @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath101 mev , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath62 , the upper bounds , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , are given for @xmath154 and @xmath155 mev , respectively .",
    "we have also analyzed the the relic abundances of the light elements by solving the boltzmann equations taking into account all the exotic processes listed in sec.[sec : result ] .",
    "we derived an allowed region on @xmath2 by adopting @xmath156 uncertainties for d / h ,  @xmath157he / d and @xmath1li/@xmath0li , and @xmath156 and @xmath158 uncertainty for @xmath0li / h . we found that , assuming @xmath65 , the @xmath0li and @xmath1li problems can be solved simultaneously in the range of @xmath159 .",
    "these results are consistent with the estimations given in sec .",
    "ii .    in the end",
    ", we have discussed the decays of the slepton in a case of @xmath160 gev and @xmath161 as an illustrating example .",
    "we found that the @xmath66-body decay shows a sharp peak at the momentum of an outgoing electron close to while the @xmath162-body decay shows a broad peak in the momentum distribution .",
    "the sharp peak is found at the momentum equal to @xmath21 , and the expected number of events for @xmath66-body decay is @xmath101 times larger than that for @xmath162-body decay .",
    "these features as well as heavy charged tracks are unique in the degenerate - mass scenario . in the case",
    "that lifetime of the long - lived slepton is @xmath163  sec , even present working detectors can stop the produced long - lived sleptons and accumulate @xmath1640.5% of them approximately  @xcite .",
    "if exotic charged tracks of long - lived particle are discovered , new facility may be constructed with higher accumulation efficiency and high momentum resolution .",
    "discovery of unique signatures of the decay in addition to charged tracks of long - lived particle will be a strong evidence of this scenario .",
