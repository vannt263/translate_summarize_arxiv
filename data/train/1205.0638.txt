    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of continuous random variables .",
    "@xmath1 is a lower record value if it is smaller than all preceding values @xmath2 and by definition , @xmath3 is taken as the first lower record value .",
    "an analogous definition can be provided for upper record values . *",
    "such data may be represented by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th record value meaning new minimum ( or maximum ) and @xmath7 is the number of trials following the observation of @xmath5 that are needed to obtain a new record value @xmath8 . throughout this paper , we denote the observed value of these record data by @xmath9 . *",
    "record statistics arise naturally in many practical problems and in applied fields such as athletic events ( kuper and sterken , 2003 ) , biology ( krug and jain , 2005 ) , catastrophic loss ( hsieh , 2004 and pfeifer , 1997 ) , climate research ( benestad , 2003 ) , financial markets ( bradlow and park , 2007 and de haan _ et al . _ , 2009 ) , industrial application ( samaniego and whitaker , 1986 and 1988 ) , spatial patterns ( yang and lee , 2007 ) , and traffic analysis ( glick , 1978 ) .",
    "hence , finding optimal statistical inferential procedures based on record data becomes very important and useful from a data - analysis point of view .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present briefly the notation to be used through out the paper and also the form of pareto distribution to be studied here . in section 3",
    ", we describe the basic form of record data to be considered and the corresponding likelihood function . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the optimal point estimation of the pareto parameters , while the interval estimation is handled in section 5 .",
    "tests of hypotheses concerning the parameters are discussed in section 6 and finally a numerical example is presented in section 7 in order to illustrate all the inferential procedures developed here .",
    "throughout the paper , we will use the following notation : +   +    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     from and , the mle of @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the basis of record data are obtained to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . from , an equi - tailed @xmath14 confidence interval for @xmath10",
    "is obtained to be @xmath15 similarly , a minimum - width @xmath14 confidence interval for @xmath11 in the class is obtained as @xmath16 for testing @xmath17 against the alternative @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 , which gives @xmath20 from table [ table : doost : bala ] , we have @xmath21 . therefore , implies that @xmath22 is not rejected .",
    "since we can not find @xmath23 in , we can not test the hypothesis @xmath24 against the alternative @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", one may conduct a simulation study and calculate the percentile of @xmath26 in by specifying @xmath27 , and then carry out a likelihood - ratio test .",
