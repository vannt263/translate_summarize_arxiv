    "ultracold fermi atoms in optical lattices have attracted considerable interest both experimentally mk05,hm05,jkc06,tr06,ts06,ns07,rj08,us08,yal10,ns10,lt12,jsk12,dg13,jh13,gp14,pmd15 and theoretically mr03,mr04,xj05,mi05,mi130,ez06,xg07,lm07,am07,sjg07,fk07,ba07,mrb08,mt08,mt10,mm08,kw08,yc09,ah10,ks11,ay11,kk12,dv12,zs12,st14 , because these setups are powerful platforms to simulate rich physics of strongly - correlated materials @xcite .",
    "one of advantages of this system is that the spatial geometry of optical lattices can be well controlled .",
    "especially , using a strong harmonic transverse confinement , one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices have been achieved experimentally hm05,yal10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative parameters have high controllability , and moreover , can reach the regimes that can not be accessible in the conventional condensed - matter physics .",
    "for example , the two - body interaction between fermi atoms can be tuned by a magnetic - field - dependent feshbach resonant technique @xcite , and thus ranges from the positive ( repulsive ) to the negative ( attractive ) . for the on - site repulsive interaction ,",
    "a well - known second - order quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic mott insulator and a metallic phase can emerge @xcite .",
    "another important breakthrough in recent experiments of ultracold fermi atoms is to successfully create a synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , with equal rashba and dresselhaus strengths , by a pair of counter - propagating raman lasers @xcite .",
    "indeed , soc describes interaction between the spin and orbit degrees of freedom of a particle .",
    "in contrast to the typical property of solid state materials that the intrinsic soc strength is generally smaller than the fermi velocity of electrons , this synthetic soc strength realized can reach the same order as ( or even larger than ) the fermi velocity of atoms , and moreover , can also be tuned in a wide range @xcite .",
    "recent theory has revealed that soc can generate exotic superfluids , including topological bardeen - cooper - schrieffer mg11,jz11,mg12,ks12,rw12,xijl12,mi13,hh13 and topological fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov @xcite phases , for the attractive fermi atoms .",
    "the fundamental picture for achieving these nontrivial topological superfluids is that soc , zeeman field , and @xmath4-wave interaction can induce triplet @xmath5-wave pairing @xcite . in parallel with the attractive case ,",
    "it is natural to ask what novel physics can occur in the repulsive fermi atoms driven by the synthetic soc @xcite .    inspired by the above experimental developments and theoretical considerations , here we investigate spin - orbit coupled repulsive fermi atoms in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "recently , spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensates in the 1d optical lattice has been prepared experimentally ch14 . using a similar technique ,",
    "the system considered could also be achieved in the near future .",
    "physically , the spin - orbit coupled fermi atoms in the optical lattices have two characteristics .",
    "one is that soc can make fermi atoms hop between the nearest - neighbor sites with spin flipping ; see the hamiltonian ( [ hsoc ] ) in the following .",
    "moreover , it has a strong competition with the on - site repulsive interaction , and especially , with the conventional spin - independent hopping ; see the hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) in the following .",
    "the other is that in the presence of soc , for different chemical potentials , the fillings are quite different ; see fig .",
    "[ energyband ] .",
    "notice that in 1d quantum fluctuation becomes significant , and the mean - field results are , in principle , unreliable @xcite .",
    "here we capture the required ground - state properties , including momentum distribution and spin - correlation , by using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite , which is a powerful numerical method to study lower - dimensional strong - correlated systems us05 .",
    "the main results are given as follows .",
    "section @xmath6 is devoted to introducing our proposal and deriving a 1d fermi - hubbard model with the synthetic soc .",
    "section @xmath7 is devoted to addressing the generalized results without the on - site repulsive interaction . in this section , the unconventional momentum distribution , which depends crucially on the filling , are found .",
    "we call the corresponding phase the soc - induced metallic phase .",
    "section @xmath8 is devoted to discussing the results in the presence of the on - site repulsive interaction . by means of the spin - correlation function",
    ", we find that soc can drive the system from a spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator to a spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator . as a result ,",
    "a second - order quantum phase transition between the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator and the soc - induced metallic phase is predicted at the strong soc . here",
    "the spin rotating means that the spin orientations of the nearest - neighbor sites are not parallel or antiparallel , i.e. , they have an intersection angle @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice ] in the following ) . in the spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator , @xmath9 , and",
    "the quasi - long - range spin correlation decays as a power law and changes the sign with a period @xmath10 , whereas for the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator , @xmath11 , and the quasi - long - range spin correlation also decays as a power law but with the period @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we show that the momentum @xmath1 , at which peak of the spin - structure factor appears , can also be affected dramatically by soc . the analytical expression of this momentum with respect to the soc strength is also derived .",
    "it suggests that the predicted spin - rotating ferromagnetic ( @xmath2 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath3 ) correlations can be detected experimentally by measuring the soc - dependent spin - structure factor via the time - of - flight imaging @xcite .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are given in section @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ setup ] shows our proposal that repulsive fermi atoms in a 1d optical lattice are driven by a pair of counter - propagating raman lasers . for the specific experiments ,",
    "3d optical lattice is first prepared by the interference of three pairs of counter - propagating laser beams ml07,ts10 .",
    "the corresponding periodic potential can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lattice depth , @xmath16 is the wave vector , and @xmath17 is wavelength . by further using a strong harmonic transverse confinement @xmath18 in the 3d optical lattice , i.e. , the 2d harmonic potential frequency @xmath19 is far larger than the trapping frequency @xmath20 along the weakly - confining axis , the required 1d optical lattice can be generated hm05,yal10 ; see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) . in such case ,",
    "the two - body interaction between fermi atoms is described effectively by @xcite @xmath21with the 1d @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath22where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the 3d @xmath4-wave scattering length , and @xmath26 is the atomic mass . in addition , a pair of counter - propagating raman lasers shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) are used to create the required 1d synthetic soc , with equal rashba and dresselhaus strengths @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the corresponding two spin states are chosen as @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29k system pw12 , or @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32li system @xcite ; see fig .",

    "for example , the hopping magnitude @xmath42 can be controlled by the intensities of lasers @xcite , the 1d on - site repulsive interaction strength @xmath43 can be tuned by feshbach resonance cc10 , and the soc strength @xmath44 can be driven through a fast and coherent modulation of raman lasers @xcite . as a consequence , for a proper optical lattice , the soc strength @xmath44 has the same order of the hopping magnitude @xmath42 @xcite .      in terms of the soc - induced properties ( see introduction ) , here we mainly focus on momentum distribution and spin correlation , which can be measured experimentally by the time - of - flight imaging @xcite .",
    "the momentum distribution functions for spin - up and spin - down atoms are written respectively as @xcite @xmath45@xmath46for the hamiltonian ( [ th ] ) , the spin - up and spin - down atoms are equal .",
    "it means that @xmath47 is the same as @xmath48 , and thus we only consider @xmath47 in the following discussions .",
    "the spin - correlation function is defined as @xcite @xmath49where @xmath50 is a distance between different sites and @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding spin - structure factor is given by @xcite @xmath52since the spin - structure factor has the sum extending over all lattice sites @xmath40 and @xmath53 , it reflects spin correlation globally , and is thus used experimentally to detect the magnetic order @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will perform the dmrg calculations , with open boundary condition , to calculate eqs .",
    "( [ mdf])-([scfm ] ) .",
    "the basic energy scale is chosen as @xmath54 . in the detailed calculations ,",
    "we retain @xmath55 truncated states ( which is sufficient ) per dmrg block and @xmath56 sweeps with the maximum truncation error @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "in order to better understand the fundamental physics induced by soc , we first consider a simple case without the on - site repulsive interaction ( @xmath58 ) , in which the hamiltonian ( [ th ] ) reduces to @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 in experiments , the 1d noninteracting fermi atoms can be realized by tuning the 3d @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath61 to its zero crossing . in such case , the 1d @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath62 , and",
    "the 1d effective two - body interaction @xmath63 then becomes zero @xcite ; see eqs .",
    "( [ 1dei ] ) and  ( [ 1ds ] ) .      in the absence of soc ( @xmath64 ) , the system have three known features .",
    "firstly , the energy bands of the hamiltonian @xmath65 are degenerate , and the system is located at the metallic phase . secondly , all fermi atoms occupy the degenerate energy bands from @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the minimum of the energy bands . moreover ,",
    "there are two degenerate fermi surfaces at the fermi momentum @xmath68 @xcite , with filling factor @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the total atomic number .",
    "at last , the chemical potential cuts the degenerate energy bands , with the fermi momenta @xmath71 . as a result , the momentum distribution function @xmath47 has a plateau of @xmath72 , with sharp edges at @xmath73 ; see the black solid curve of fig .",
    "n_k(a ) . in the large-@xmath74 limit",
    ", this plateau of @xmath72 disappears and two plateaus of @xmath75 emerge , as expected . for the different chemical potentials , the fillings are similar , and the momentum distributions are thus similar ; see the black solid curves of figs .",
    "[ n_k](b ) and  [ n_k](c ) .    in the presence of soc ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "the results are very interesting . in this case , the energy bands governed by the hamiltonian @xmath77 split into two nondegenerate subbands , whose minima and maxima are given respectively by @xmath78@xmath79it is easy to find that @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , @xmath66 , as expected . in the presence of soc ( @xmath82 )",
    ", there are generally four fermi points , when the chemical potential cuts two nondegenerate subbands . if the chemical potential is identical to the critical chemical potential @xmath83 that just cuts the contact point [ see the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ energyband](b ) ] , three fermi points can emerge . more importantly , for the different chemical potentials , the fillings are quite different ; see fig .",
    "[ energyband ] .",
    "these different fillings affect dramatically on momentum distributions . as examples ,",
    "we plot , in fig .",
    "[ n_k ] , the momentum distribution functions @xmath84 for the different soc strengths @xmath85 , when the filling factors are chosen as ( a ) @xmath86 , ( b ) @xmath87 , and ( c ) @xmath88 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ n_k](a ) that for a smaller filling , any soc leads to a new momentum distribution , in which the corresponding function @xmath84 has two plateaus of @xmath89 , apart from the conventional plateau of @xmath72 .",
    "the physical explanation is given as follows .",
    "when the soc strength is not strong enough ( see , for example , @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 , and thus both the lower and upper subbands are partly occupied ; see fig .",
    "[ energyband](c ) .",
    "the occupation in the upper subband determines the plateau of @xmath72 , while the occupation in the lower subband governs two plateaus of @xmath89 . with the increasing of the soc strength @xmath92 ,",
    "i.e. , the chemical potential @xmath93 decreases @xcite , the occupation in the upper subband becomes less , and thus the wide of the plateau of @xmath72 becomes narrower . in particular , when @xmath94 , the plateau of @xmath72 disappears , since in this case @xmath95 , and thus no occupation in the upper subband can be found .",
    "if further increasing the soc strength @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath96 , a plateau of @xmath75 emerges around @xmath97 ( not in the large-@xmath74 limit ) .",
    "this is because there is no occupation around @xmath97 when @xmath96 ; see fig .",
    "[ energyband](a ) . for the half filling ( @xmath87 ) , we find that the momentum distribution function @xmath47 usually has two plateaus of @xmath72 and @xmath89 [ see fig .

    "[ n_k](d ) .",
    "it should be noticed that in the case with a zeeman field , but without soc , the chemical potential cutting the zeeman - split bands also results in more than two fermi points . but the momentum distribution function @xmath102 is quite different from that induced by soc . in such case , the momentum distribution function @xmath47 only has the plateaus of @xmath103 .",

    "however , in the antiferromagnetic mott insulator , @xmath150 , @xmath153 , and @xmath169 . in the spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator , @xmath9 , @xmath170 , and @xmath3 .",
    "whereas in the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath2 .    in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] , we give a schematic phase diagram as a function of the soc strength @xmath85 and the on - site repulsive interaction strength @xmath171 . in this figure ,",
    "the mott insulator and the metallic phase are separated by the gap @xmath136 ( thermodynamical limit ) @xcite . the metallic phase and",
    "the soc - induced metallic phase are separated by the momentum distribution function @xmath47 . the antiferromagnetic mott insulator and the spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator",

    "we also find that the transitions between the metallic phase and the antiferromagnetic mott insulator , between the soc - induced metallic phase and the spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator , and between the soc - induced metallic phase and the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator are of second order , because the second - order derivative of the ground - state energy is discontinuous at the critical points .",
    "for the other transitions , the ground - state energy and its derivative vary smoothly .",
    "it means that no phase transition can be found , although for the different phases , the momentum distribution and the spin correlation are different .",
    "before ending up this paper , we make one remark . in the real experiment ,",
    "the zeeman field usually exists .",
    "when the zeeman field is considered , an extra hamiltonian @xmath173should be added in the hamiltonian ( [ th ] ) .",
    "this zeeman field can lead to spin flipping in the same site .",
    "moreover , it has a strong competition with soc , which makes fermi atoms hop between the nearest - neighbor sites with spin flipping , and the conventional spin - independent hopping between the nearest - neighbor sites . as a consequence",
    ", rich magnetic properties can emerge .",
    "the deep understanding of relevant behavior is very complicated ( we need introduce more physical quantities ) , but interesting .",
    "we leave this important problem for further investigation .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated spin - orbit coupled repulsive fermi atoms in a 1d optical lattice by the dmrg method .",
    "we have found that soc can generate the filling - dependent unconventional momentum distribution , whose corresponding phase is called the soc - induced metallic phase , and drive the system from the spin - rotating antiferromagnetic mott insulator to the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator . we have predicted a second - order quantum phase transition between the spin - rotating ferromagnetic mott insulator and the soc - induced metallic phase at the strong soc .",
    "finally , we have also shown that the momentum , at which peak of the spin - structure factor appears , can be affected dramatically by soc .",
    "the analytical expression of this momentum with respect to the soc strength has also been derived .",
    "attributed to the recent experimental realization of the spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensates in the 1d optical lattice @xcite , we expect that our predictions could be observed in the near future .",
    "in particular , the spin - rotating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations can be detected by measuring the soc - dependent spin - structure factor via the time - of - flight imaging @xcite .",
