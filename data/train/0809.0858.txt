    "the state of thermal equilibrium of a closed system is achieved when its entropy is at maximum . in this state ,",

    "ultimately , these fluctuations can be related to the fluctuations of thermal occupancy .",
    "for instance , thermal occupancy of quantum gases can be derived starting with a generally non - equilibrium state , followed by maximization of entropy subject to constraints ( conserved quantities).@xcite    this approach to fluctuations , however , neglects sample - specific variations : it assumes that sampling occurs in the ensemble of identical systems that are in different states , slightly away from the equilibrium.@xcite on the other hand , it has become abundantly clear over the last half - century that sample - specific variations are an important source of fluctuations , as witnessed by developments in mesoscopic physics .",
    "these must be included when thermodynamic properties of many identically prepared , yet not identical , systems are studied . in this work",
    "we investigate the combined contribution of mesoscopic fluctuations and fluctuations of thermal occupancy to fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we use a simple formalism that gives fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities as a sum of two terms : the first due to thermal occupancy fluctuations and the second due to sample - specific fluctuations .",
    "the latter is expressed in terms of the correlation function of the density of energy levels .",
    "the results are illustrated for the fluctuations of the number of particles and of the specific heat in systems with the fixed chemical potential and volume . as a model system",
    ", we use the degenerate , two - dimensional , non - interacting electron gas with level statics corresponding to classically chaotic and integrable motions respectively .",
    "in the most general form , the value of a thermodynamic quantity , whose density is expressed as a function of energy , can be computed as the integral over the spectrum @xmath3 where @xmath4 level density and @xmath5 is the thermal occupancy . under an obvious assumption that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are uncorrelated variables , we find the following expressions for the mean and the variance @xmath8@xmath9 where the over - bar stands for a mean value .  using @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the chemical potential and @xmath12 is temperature , we find @xmath13 combining eqs .",

    ", we find @xmath18",
    "we apply the above results to a non - interacting , degenerate , two - dimensional electron gas occupying area @xmath19 . in this case",
    "@xmath20 is a constant inverse average level spacing and @xmath21 is the electron mass . using standard low - temperature ( sommerfeld )",
    "expansion,@xcite we find @xmath22-@xmath23 @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is the fermi energy , and @xmath25 next , we proceed to evaluate @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the classically chaotic and integrable circumstances respectively and compare those to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    to simplify calculation",
    ", we assume a unitary ensemble ( broken time reversal symmetry ) in the classically chaotic case@xcite@xmath30 we also use a simplified ansatz in the classically integrable case@xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the the energy scale corresponding to the shortest classical periodic orbit.@xcite in a square well , for instance , @xmath33 .",
    "the simplified ansatz neglects large oscillations of the density correlation function for @xmath34.@xcite these should be of little consequence at finite temperatures since harmonics with incommensurate frequencies will be mixed it to wash out the effect of such oscillations.@xcite still , unlike in the chaotic case , the correlation function depends on @xmath35 via @xmath32 .",
    "however , due to relevant @xmath35 s being restricted to the interval of order @xmath12 around @xmath23 , we can replace @xmath36 @xmath23 @xmath37 with this substitution , it will be shown below that for @xmath38 the result for integrable systems is due to the delta function term in ( [ rho_rho - in ] ) .",
    "conversely , for @xmath39 , the full oscillatory behavior of the level correlation function discussed in ref.@xcite should be of little consequence since their scale is defined by @xmath32 .",
    "this reasoning is ultimately confirmed by numerical evaluation using the full form of the correlation function@xcite ( with substitution @xmath40 @xmath23 ) , which yields results that are extremely close to the analytical results for @xmath26 obtained below using ( [ rho_rho - in ] ) .    to eliminate temperature - independent divergencies",

    "further integration on @xmath12 gives @xmath47 and @xmath48 for classically chaotic and integrable systems respectively , with @xmath32 given by ( [ em ] ) and zero - temperature fluctuations given by @xmath49 the latter is simply the variance of the number of levels over the fermi sea and we use the results for the level number fluctuations from ref.@xcite to find @xmath50 and @xmath51 for classically chaotic and integrable systems respectively .",

    "notice , that for temperatures below the energy scale where level rigidity sets in@xcite,@xcite - @xmath55 for classically chaotic and @xmath32 for classically integrable systems - the main effect of temperature is to _ reduce _ sample specific fluctuations of the number of particles relative to the zero - temperature limit .",
    "furthermore , the temperature - dependent part of such fluctuations largely cancels the fluctuations ( [ nvar2d - f_cvar2d - f ] ) due to thermal occupancy .",
    "incidentally , since in this limit the temperature - dependent sample - specific fluctuations are dominated by the @xmath56-function term in ( [ rho_rho - ch ] ) and ( [ rho_rho - in ] ) , the temperature - dependent particle number fluctuation can be found directly from @xmath57 confirming the results in ( [ nvar2d_ch - p ] ) and ( [ nvar2d_in - p ] ) .",

    "in contrast with chaotic systems , in integrable systems the decay of fluctuations of the specific heat at high temperature is consistent with the greater level rigidity at larger energy scales , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we showed that the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities can be separated into those that are due to sample - to - sample ( mesoscopic ) fluctuations and those due to thermal occupancy fluctuations . for a 2d non - interacting degenerate electron gas",
    ", both effects were included in evaluation of the particle number and specific heat fluctuations for classically chaotic and integrable cases . in the integrable case , the specific heat fluctuations due to either effect are comparable over a wide range of temperatures . for the particle number fluctuation ,",
