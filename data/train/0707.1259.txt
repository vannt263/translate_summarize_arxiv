    "allowing for a dependence on @xmath114 also implies the appearance of new functions , such as the sivers function @xcite @xmath115 : @xmath116 upon integration over transverse momentum the @xmath114-odd sivers function @xmath115 drops out .",
    "similarly , a chiral - odd tmd can arise that is also @xmath114-odd : @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , the fragmentation function analogues @xmath118 and @xmath119 arise .",
    "the sivers effect can lead to a non - zero @xmath99 in @xmath120 , but also to azimuthal spin asymmetries in many different processes , such as in semi - inclusive dis or back - to - back jets in @xmath121 scattering .",

    "[ fig : bacchetta ] ) the sivers function leads to     and @xmath122 indicated @xcite . ]    a @xmath123 asymmetry ( @xmath124 ) , which can be distinguished from the collins asymmetry @xmath125 which arises with the transversity function ( @xmath126 ) @xcite .",
    "bacchetta presented the complete expressions of all 18 possible semi - inclusive dis structure functions in terms of tmds @xcite .",
    "the first azimuthal spin asymmetry measurement was done by the hermes collaboration @xcite . at dis 2007 the",

    "compass results on these and other asymmetries show that for the deuteron these asymmetries are all consistent with zero , indicating cancellations rather than small functions @xcite .     measured by star @xcite . ]    as mentioned , the sivers effect can also lead to a non - zero @xmath99 asymmetry for back - to - back jet production in @xmath91 scattering @xcite . in general ,",
    "the two jets are not exactly back - to - back and an asymmetric distribution of one jet around the other may arise from the sivers effect .",

    "the data are also consistent with a recent prediction presented by bomhof @xcite , based on sivers function input from semi - inclusive dis which probes mostly the large-@xmath32 part of the sivers functions .",
    "one concludes that the smaller @xmath32 part that is probed in the back - to - back jets sivers asymmetry is likely to be small .",
    "however , another aspect that contributes to the suppression of the magnitude of the back - to - back jets sivers asymmetry is that the color flow of the process makes it less sensitive to the sivers function .",
    "it has been noted several years ago by collins @xcite that tmds can exhibit a calculable process dependence , leading to the result that the sivers function that enter the semi - inclusive asymmetry enters the analogous drell  yan asymmetry with opposite sign .",

    "there has been important technical progress in the description of hard exclusive processes , with full nlo results in @xmath34 available for most relevant channels , partial nnlo results for compton scattering and a better understanding of the evolution of gpds . at dis2007 diehl",
    "presented such nlo calculations for exclusive meson production at hera collider and at fixed target kinematics  @xcite .",
    "new avenues have been opened for the parameterization of gpds : luiti introduced an alternative to the mathematical ansatz of double distributions in that gpds are generated from direct constraints from experimental data combined with lattice calculations yielding a model independent extraction  @xcite .",
    "experimental access to gpds is very difficult as the count rates for hard exclusive reactions typically drop drastically with increase of the hardness of the process . nevertheless , there is great progress on the experimental side .",
    "hermes has presented an overview about the so far measured dvcs observables which comprises the full set of azimuthal and single - spin asymmetries w.r.t .  the charge and helicity of the lepton beam , and w.r.t .  to the spin polarization of the target , either longitudinal or transverse w.r.t .",
    "the lepton beam  @xcite .",
    "these results are very promising in view of the greatly improved detection capabilities for exclusive processes with the information from the recoil detector installed early 2006 .",
    "hermes also presented the dvcs beam - spin asymmetries measured with a variety of nuclear targets ranging from deuterium to xenon  @xcite which may provide information about the nuclear forces as well as on the modification of nucleon properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "[ fig : exclusive ] , left panel , shows the ratio of the nuclear to free proton dvcs beam - spin asymmetries as a function of the atomic mass number @xmath149 .",
    "for the coherent region this ratio is predicted  @xcite to have values ranging from 1.85 to 1.95 for @xmath150 to @xmath151 .    the jefferson laboratory hall - a experiment presented a measurement of the dvcs cross - section in the valence quark region on proton and neutron targets  @xcite .",
    "the experiment on the proton provides a strong indication of factorization at @xmath31 as low as 2 gev@xmath152 , therefore validating a gpd based analysis .    of particular interest in the context of spin physics is the proton helicity - flip distribution @xmath153 which has connection with two crucial aspects of spin physics : transverse polarization effects and the orbital angular momentum @xmath154 carried by quarks in the nucleon .",
    "key observables for these studies are transverse target - spin asymmetries in dvcs and in exclusive @xmath155 production .",
    "hermes has presented preliminary results for both channels  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusive ] right panel for the @xmath156 asymmetry ) . their comparison with a model calculation  @xcite using the total angular momentum of quarks , @xmath157 , as input parameter in the ansatz for @xmath153 shows that these asymmetries are indeed sensitive to @xmath158 in the hermes kinematics .",
    "the measurement of the dvcs cross - section on the neutron at jefferson laboratory hall - a experiment  @xcite provide information about @xmath159 using the same gpd model . the complementary constraints on the total angular momenta of up- and down - quarks from both experiments remarkably coincide with recent calculations of @xmath157 from lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "exciting new information has been obtained on the nucleon spin structure from polarized lepton  nucleon and proton  proton scattering .",
    "however , a detailed measurement of the gluon polarization remains one of the most important issues in spin physics .",
    "running rhic at higher energy ( @xmath160 gev ) will shed more light on this issue .",
    "transverse spin physics turns out to be a very active and quickly developing field .",
    "important results comprise the first extraction of the transversity as well as of transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation functions like the sivers distribution and the collins fragmentation function .",
    "these achievements can be considered as milestones in the field .",
    "they constitute the first step towards a complete description of the partonic structure of hadrons beyond the collinear parton model .",
    "a rich future is expected for the elegant concept of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "intensive experimental efforts have demonstrated the feasibility of measurements of hard - exclusive reactions in a large variety of channels .",
    "it turned out that polarization observables serve as a very powerful tool to access the different gpds .",
    "the interplay between spin degrees of freedom and parton orbital angular momentum will be a key to understand the spin structure of the nucleon .",
