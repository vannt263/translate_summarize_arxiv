    "discrete logarithm computations in finite fields is one of the important topics in algorithmic number theory , partly due to its relevance to public key cryptography . the complexity of discrete logarithm algorithms for finite fields @xmath4 depends on the size of the characteristic @xmath2 with respect to the cardinality @xmath5 . in order to classify the known methods ,",
    "it is convenient to use the famous @xmath6 function . if @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 are two constants , we set @xmath9 and sometimes we simply write @xmath10 if the constant @xmath11 is not made explicit .",
    "when we consider discrete logarithm computations , we treat separately families of finite fields for which the characteristic @xmath2 can be written in the form @xmath12 for a given range of values for @xmath13 .",
    "we say that we are dealing with finite fields of _ small characteristic _ if the family is such that @xmath14 ; _ medium characteristic _ if we have @xmath15 ; and _ large characteristic _ if @xmath16 . in this article",
    ", we concentrate on the cases of medium and large characteristic .",
    "this covers also the situation where @xmath17 , that we call the medium  large characteristic boundary case .",
    "we start with a brief overview of the general situation , including the small characteristic case for completeness ( all the complexities mentioned here are based on unproven heuristics ) .",
    "the case of small characteristic is the one that has been improved in the most dramatic way in the recent years . before 2013 ,",
    "the best known complexity of @xmath18{32/9})$ ] was obtained with the function field sieve  @xcite but a series of improvements  @xcite has led to a quasi - polynomial complexity for fixed characteristic , and more generally to a complexity of @xmath19 when @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the case of large characteristic is covered by an algorithm called the number field sieve ( nfs ) that is very close to the algorithm with the same name used for factoring integers  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for prime fields , and it shares the same complexity of @xmath22{64/9})$ ] . in the case of small extension degrees ,",
    "the main reference is a variant by joux , lercier , smart and vercauteren  @xcite who showed how to get the same complexity in the whole range of fields of large characteristic .",
    "the case of medium characteristic was also tackled in the same article , thus getting a complexity of @xmath22{128/9})$ ] , with another variant of nfs .",
    "the complexities listed above use versions of nfs where only two number fields are involved .",
    "it is however known that using more number fields can improve the complexity . for prime fields",
    "it has been done in  @xcite , while for large and medium characteristic , it has been recently studied in  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the complexity remains of the form @xmath23 , but the exponent constant @xmath11 is improved : in the large characteristic case we have @xmath24{(92 + 26\\sqrt{13})/27}$ ] , like for prime fields , while in the medium characteristic case , we have @xmath24{2^{13}/3 ^ 6}$ ] . for the moment",
    ", these multiple number field variants have not been used for practical record computations ( they have not yet been used either for records in integer factorization ) .    in the medium ",
    "large characteristic boundary case , where @xmath25 , the complexity given in  @xcite is also of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath11 varies between @xmath26 and @xmath27{2^{13}/3 ^ 6}$ ] in a way that is non - monotonic with @xmath28 .",
    "we also mention another variant of nfs that has been announced  @xcite that seems to be better in some range of @xmath28 , when using multiple number fields .    in terms of practical record computations , the case of prime fields has been well studied , with frequent announcements  @xcite . in the case of medium characteristic , there were also some large computations performed to illustrate the new methods ; see table 8 in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however in the case of non - prime field of large characteristic , we are not aware of previous practical experiments , despite their potential interest in pairing - based cryptography .",
    "* summary of contributions .",
    "* our two main contributions are , on one side , new complexity results for the finite fields of medium characteristic , and on the other side , a practical record computation in a finite field of the form @xmath1 .",
    "key tools for these results are two new methods for selecting the number fields ; the first one is a generalization of the method by joux and lercier  @xcite and we call the second one the conjugation method .",
    "it turned out that both of them have practical and theoretical advantages .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the norms that must be tested for smoothness during nfs based on the conjugation method or the generalized joux - lercier method are smaller than the ones obtained with previous methods for certain kind of finite fields . therefore , the probability of being smooth is higher , which translates into a better complexity .",
    "depending on the type of finite fields , the gain is different :    * in the medium characteristic finite fields , nfs with the conjugation method has a complexity of @xmath18{96/9})$ ] .",
    "this is much better than the complexity of @xmath18{128/9})$ ] obtained in  @xcite and also beats the @xmath29{2^{13}/3 ^ 6})$ ] complexity of the multiple number field algorithm of  @xcite .",
    "* in the medium ",
    "large characteristic boundary case , the situation is more complicated , but there are also families of finite fields for which the best known complexity is obtained with the conjugation method or with the generalized joux - lercier method . the overall minimal complexity is obtained for fields with @xmath30{12})$ ] , where the complexity drops to @xmath22{48/9})$ ] with the conjugation method .    on the practical side ,",
    "the two polynomials generated by the conjugation method ( and for one of the polynomials with the generalized joux - lercier construction ) enjoy structural properties : it is often possible to use computations with explicit units ( as was done in the early ages of nfs for factoring , before adleman introduced the use of characters ) , thus saving the use of schirokauer maps that have a non - negligible cost during the linear algebra phase .",
    "furthermore , it is also often possible to impose the presence of field automorphisms which can be used to speed - up various stages of nfs , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the presence of automorphisms can interact with the general nfs construction and lead to several units having zero virtual logarithms .",
    "this is again very interesting in practice , because some dense columns ( explicit units or schirokauer maps ) can be erased in the matrix .",
    "a careful study of this phenomenon allowed us to predict precisely when it occurs .",
    "all these practical improvements do not change the complexity but make the computations faster .",
    "in fact , even though the conjugation method is at its best for medium characteristic , it proved to be competitive even for quadratic extensions .",
    "it was therefore used in our record computation of discrete logarithm in the finite field @xmath1 for a random - looking prime @xmath2 of 80 decimal digits .",
    "the running time was much less than what is required to solve the discrete logarithm problem in a prime field of similar size , namely 160 decimal digits .    * outline . * in section  [ sec : refresher ] we make a quick presentation of nfs , and we insist on making precise the definitions of virtual logarithms in the case of explicit units and in the case of schirokauer maps . in section  [ sec : galois ]",
    "we show how to obtain a practical improvement using field automorphisms , again taking care of the two ways of dealing with units .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : vanishing ] we explain how to predict the cases where the virtual logarithm of a unit is zero , and in section  [ sec : units ] we show how to use this knowledge to reduce the number of schirokauer maps if we do not use explicit units . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : polyselect ] we present our two new methods for selecting polynomials , the complexities of which are analyzed in section  [ sec : complexity ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : effective ] with a report about our practical computation in @xmath1 .",
    "in a nutshell , the number field sieve for discrete logarithms in @xmath4 is as follows . in the first stage , called polynomial selection , two polynomials @xmath31 in @xmath32 $ ] are constructed ( we assume that @xmath33 ) , such that their reductions modulo @xmath2 have a common monic irreducible factor @xmath34 of degree @xmath35 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are monic .",
    "we call @xmath38 a monic polynomial of @xmath32 $ ] whose reduction modulo @xmath2 equals @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath39 be algebraic numbers such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be a root of @xmath34 in @xmath4 , allowing us to write @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the number fields associated to @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 their rings of integers .",
    "for the second stage of nfs , called relation collection or sieve , a smoothness bound @xmath48 is chosen and we consider the associated factor base @xmath49 that we decompose into @xmath50 according to the ring of integers to which the ideals belong . an integer is @xmath48-smooth if all its prime factors are less than @xmath48 . for any polynomial @xmath51 $ ] , the algebraic integer @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) in @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) is @xmath48-smooth if the corresponding principal ideal @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) factors into prime ideals that belong to @xmath56 ( resp .",
    "@xmath57 ) .",
    "this is almost , but not exactly equivalent to asking that the norm @xmath58 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) is @xmath48-smooth .    in the sieve stage ,",
    "one collects @xmath60 polynomials @xmath51 $ ] with coprime coefficients and degree bounded by @xmath61 , for a parameter @xmath62 to be chosen , such that both @xmath52 and @xmath63 are @xmath48-smooth , so that we get _ relations _ of the form : @xmath64 the norm of @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "of @xmath63 ) is the product of the norms of the ideals in the right hand side and will be ( crudely ) bounded by the size of the finite field ; therefore the number of ideals involved in a relation is less than @xmath65 .",
    "one can also remark that the ideals that can occur in a relation have degrees that are at most equal to the degree of @xmath66 , that is @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to include in @xmath67 only the ideals of degree at most @xmath61 ( for a theoretical analysis of nfs one can consider the variant where only ideals of degree one are included in the factor base ) .    in order to estimate the probability to get a relation for a polynomial @xmath66 with given degree and size of coefficients , we make the common heuristic that the integer @xmath68 has the same probability to be @xmath48-smooth as a random integer of the same size and that the bias due to powers is negligible .",
    "therefore , reducing the expected size of this product of norms is the main criterion when selecting the polynomials @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in the linear algebra stage ,",
    "each relation is rewritten as a linear equation between the so - called virtual logarithms of the factor base elements .",
    "we recall this notion in section  [ ssec : virtual logarithms ] .",
    "we make the usual heuristic that this system has a space of solutions of dimension one . since the system is sparse , an iterative algorithm like wiedemann s  @xcite is used to compute a non - zero solution in quasi - quadratic time .",
    "this gives the ( virtual ) logarithms of all the factor base elements .    in principle",
    ", the coefficient ring of the matrix is @xmath69 , but it is enough to solve it modulo each prime divisor @xmath70 of @xmath71 and then to recombine the results using the pohlig - hellman algorithm  @xcite . since one can use pollard s method  @xcite for small primes @xmath70 , we can suppose that @xmath70 is larger than @xmath72 .",
    "it allows us then to assume that @xmath70 is coprime to @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the class numbers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the orders of the roots of unity in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these assumptions are used in many places in the rest of the article , sometimes implicitly .    in the last stage of the algorithm ,",
    "called individual logarithm , the discrete logarithm of any element @xmath75 of @xmath4 in the finite field is computed . for this , we associate to @xmath76 the algebraic number @xmath77 in @xmath44 and check whether the corresponding principal ideal factors into prime ideals of norms bounded by a quantity @xmath78 larger than @xmath48 .",
    "we also ask the prime ideals to be of degree at most @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath79 does not verify these smoothness assumptions , then we replace @xmath76 by @xmath80 for a randomly chosen integer @xmath81 and try again .",
    "this allows to obtain a linear equation similar to those of the linear system , in which one of the unknowns is @xmath82 .",
    "the second step of the individual logarithm stage consists in obtaining relations between a prime ideal and prime ideals of smaller norm , until all the ideals involved are in @xmath67 .",
    "this allows to backtrack and obtain @xmath82 .      in this section ,",
    "we recall the definition of virtual logarithms , while keeping in mind that in the rest of the article , we are going to use either explicit unit computations or schirokauer maps .",
    "the constructions work independently in each number field , so we explain them for the field @xmath44 corresponding to the polynomial @xmath36 . during nfs ,",
    "this is also applied to @xmath45 .",
    "we start by fixing a notation for the `` reduction modulo @xmath2 '' map that will be used in several places of the article .",
    "let @xmath83 be the map from @xmath46 to @xmath4 defined by the reduction modulo the prime ideal @xmath84 above @xmath2 that corresponds to the factor @xmath38 of @xmath36 modulo @xmath2 .",
    "this is a ring homomorphism .",
    "furthermore , if the norm of @xmath76 is coprime to @xmath2 , then @xmath85 is non - zero in @xmath4 .",
    "we can therefore extend @xmath83 to the set of elements of @xmath44 whose norm has a non - negative valuation at @xmath2 .",
    "since in this article we will often consider the discrete logarithm of the images by @xmath83 , we restrict its definition to the elements of @xmath44 whose norm is coprime to @xmath2 , for which the image is non - zero .",
    "let @xmath86 be the class number @xmath44 that we assume to be coprime to the prime @xmath70 modulo which the logarithms are computed",
    ". we also need to consider the group of units @xmath87 in @xmath46 . by dirichlet",
    "s theorem it is a finitely generated abelian group of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the unit rank given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of real roots of @xmath36 and @xmath92 the number of complex roots , and @xmath93 is cyclic .",
    "any unit @xmath94 can be written @xmath95 for _ fundamental units _",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 a root of unity .    for each prime ideal @xmath99 in the factor base @xmath56 ,",
    "the ideal @xmath100 is principal and therefore there exists a generator @xmath101 for it .",
    "it is not at all unique , and the definition of the virtual logarithms will depend on the choice of the fundamental units and of the set of generators for all the ideals of @xmath56 .",
    "we denote by @xmath102 this choice , and will use it as a subscript in our notations to remember the dependence in @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , the notation @xmath103 used just below means that the definition of the virtual logarithm depends on the choice of @xmath102 , and does not mean that the logarithm is given in base @xmath102 ; in fact all along the article we do not make explicit the generator used as a basis for the logarithm in the finite field .",
    "let @xmath99 be an ideal in the factor base @xmath56 , and @xmath101 the generator for its @xmath86-th power , given by the choice @xmath102 .",
    "then the virtual logarithm of @xmath99 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath102 is given by @xmath104 where the @xmath105 notation on the right - hand side is the discrete logarithm function in @xmath4 .",
    "in the same manner , we define the virtual logarithms of the units by @xmath106    we now use this definition to show that for any polynomial @xmath66 yielding a relation , we can obtain a linear expression between the logarithm of @xmath107 in the finite field and the virtual logarithms of the ideals involved in the factorization of the ideal @xmath54 : @xmath108 after raising this equation to the power @xmath86 , we get an equation between principal ideals that can be rewritten as the following equation between field elements : @xmath109 where the @xmath110 are integers used to express the unit that pops up in the process .",
    "we then apply the map @xmath83 , and use the fact that it is an homomorphism .",
    "we obtain therefore @xmath111 from which we deduce our target equation by taking logarithms on both sides : @xmath112 in this last step , the contribution of the root of unity @xmath98 has disappeared . indeed ,",
    "the following simple lemma states that its logarithm vanishes modulo @xmath70 .",
    "[ lem : roots of unity ] let @xmath98 be a torsion unit of order @xmath113 and assume that @xmath114 .",
    "then we have @xmath115 .    since @xmath116 in @xmath44 , we have @xmath117 in @xmath4 and we get @xmath118 .    in order to make the equation  [ eq : explicit ] explicit for a given @xmath66 that yields a relation , it is necessary to compute the class number @xmath86 of @xmath44 , to find the generators of all the @xmath100 and to compute a set of fundamental units .",
    "these are reknowned to be difficult problems except for polynomials @xmath36 with tiny coefficients .",
    "we now recall an alternate definition of virtual logarithms based on the so - called schirokauer maps , for which none of the above have to be computed explicitly .",
    "let @xmath119 be the multiplicative subgroup of @xmath120 of elements whose norms are coprime to @xmath70 .",
    "a schirokauer map is an application @xmath121 such that    * @xmath122 ( @xmath123 is linear ) ; * @xmath124 is surjective ( @xmath123 preserves the unit rank ) .",
    "schirokauer  @xcite proposed a fast - to - evaluate map satisfying these conditions that we recall now .",
    "let us define first an integer , that is the lcm of the exponents required to apply fermat s theorem in each residue field modulo @xmath70 : @xmath125 then , by construction , for any element @xmath126 in @xmath119 , we have @xmath127 congruent to @xmath128 in all the residue fields above @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the map @xmath129 is well defined for @xmath130 . taking the coordinates of the image of this map in the basis @xmath131",
    ", we can expect to find @xmath89 independent linear combinations of these coordinates .",
    "they then form a schirokauer map .",
    "in  @xcite , schirokauer gave heuristic arguments for the existence of such independent linear combinations ; and in practice , in most of the cases , taking the @xmath89 first coordinates is enough .",
    "from now on , we work with a fixed choice of schirokauer map that we denote by @xmath123 .",
    "we start by taking another set of @xmath89 independent units : for each @xmath132 $ ] , we choose a unit @xmath96 such that @xmath133 where the coordinate @xmath86 is in the @xmath134-th position .",
    "we can then refine the choice of the generators of the @xmath86-th power of the factor base ideals , so that we get another definition of the virtual logarithms .",
    "let @xmath123 be a schirokauer map as described above .",
    "let @xmath99 be an ideal in the factor base @xmath56 , and @xmath101 an ( implicit ) generator for its @xmath86-th power , such that @xmath135 .",
    "then the virtual logarithm of @xmath99 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath123 is given by @xmath136 the virtual logarithms of the units are defined in a similar manner : @xmath137    as shown in  @xcite , by an argument similar to the case of explicit generators ,",
    "one can write @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the @xmath134-th coordinate of @xmath123 .      equation   can be written for the two polynomials @xmath36 and @xmath37 and hence we obtain a linear equation relating only virtual logarithms .",
    "we remark that it is completely allowed to use the virtual logarithms in their explicit version for one of the polynomials if it is feasible , while using schirokauer maps on the other side .    using explicit units",
    "requires to compute a generator for each ideal in the factor base , and therefore the polynomial must have small coefficients ( and small class number ) .",
    "a lot of techniques and algorithms are well described in @xcite .",
    "these include generating units and generators in some box or ellipsoid of small lengths , and recovery of units using floating point computations .",
    "these are quite easy to implement and are fast in practice .",
    "we may do some simplifications when @xmath44 has non - trivial automorphisms , since in this case the generators of several ideals can be computed from one another using automorphisms ( see section [ sec : galois ] ) .    in the general case ,",
    "one uses schirokauer maps whose coefficients are elements of @xmath140 for a large prime @xmath70 . in our experiments ,",
    "the values of the schirokauer maps seem to spread in the full range @xmath141 $ ] and must be stored on @xmath142 bits . in a recent record  @xcite ,",
    "each row of the matrix consisted in average of @xmath143 non - zero entries in the interval @xmath144 $ ] and two values in @xmath141 $ ] , for a prime @xmath70 of several machine words .",
    "it is then worth to make additional computations in order to reduce the number of schirokauer maps .",
    "this motivated our study in section [ sec : units ] .",
    "using automorphisms of the fields involved in a discrete logarithm computation is far from being a new idea .",
    "it was already proposed by joux , lercier , smart and vercauteren  @xcite and was a key ingredient in many of the recent record computations in small characteristic  @xcite . in this section",
    "we recall the basic idea and make explicit the interaction with both definitions of virtual logarithms , using or not schirokauer maps .",
    "the results of this subsection apply potentially to both number fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 independently .",
    "therefore , we will express all the statements with the notations corresponding to the polynomial @xmath36 ( that again , we assume to be monic for simplicity ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath44 has an automorphism @xmath145 , and we denote by @xmath146 and @xmath147 the polynomials of @xmath148 $ ] such that @xmath149 and @xmath150 . for any subset @xmath151 of @xmath44 ,",

    "at this point we could test that the logs on the f - side were correct .",
    "the last step is that of computing some individual logarithms .",
    "we used @xmath518 as a generator for @xmath508 and the following `` random '' element : @xmath519 we started by looking for an integer @xmath81 such that @xmath520 , seen as an element of the number field of @xmath36 , is smooth .",
