    "it is important to study qcd at high temperature and high density by numerical simulations of lattice qcd . in particular",
    ", studies of the equation of state ( eos ) can provide basic input for the analysis of the experimental signatures for qgp formation , e.g. the eos will control the properties of any hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "we extend studies of the eos to non - zero baryon number density .",
    "simulation at non - zero baryon density is known to be difficult ; however recent studies have found that a taylor expansion with respect to chemical potential @xmath3 is an efficient technique to investigate the low density regime , interesting for heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the calculation of the taylor expansion coefficients , i.e. calculation of the derivatives at @xmath4 , the technical difficulty for non - zero @xmath3 does not arise and a quantitative study becomes possible within the error by truncation of higher order terms . since",
    "thermodynamic quantities can be defined by derivatives of the partition function , e.g. chiral condensate @xmath5 , quark number density @xmath6 , quark number susceptibility @xmath7 , and isospin susceptibility @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the calculation of first derivatives yields basic qcd thermodynamics observables , and the calculation of higher derivatives is a natural extension .    in this study",
    ", we evaluate the taylor expansion coefficients of thermodynamic quantities and compare these results to the predictions from the perturbation theory in the high temperature limit and from the hadron resonance gas model in the low temperature hadron phase",
    ". also fluctuations of quark number , isospin number and electric charge are discussed near the transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "they are estimated by @xmath12 , @xmath13 and charge susceptibility @xmath14 , and are related to the critical endpoint expected at non - zero @xmath15 .",
    "moreover we study the taylor expansion coefficients of chiral condensate and heavy quark free energy .",
    "the details of simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "-0.8 cm    -0.6 cm [ fig : c2c4c6 ]",
    "we define the expansion coefficients by @xmath16 , @xmath17/t^2 \\equiv   \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty } n(n-1 ) c_n [ c_n^i ] ( \\mu_q / t)^{n-2}$ ] and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "we expect the equation of state to approach that of a free quark - gluon gas ( stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) gas ) in the high temperature limit .",
    "the coefficients in the sb limit for 2 flavour qcd with @xmath19 are well known as @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "moreover the sign of @xmath23 is negative starting at @xmath24 in perturbation theory . on the other hand , in the low temperature phase qcd",
    "is well described by a hadron resonance gas model in which the pressure is obtained by summing over the contributions from all resonance states of hadrons . in this model ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath25 from each individual hadron which has baryon number @xmath26 is in proportion to @xmath27 , hence the pressure can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mesonic and baryonic components of @xmath25 at @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here , the mesonic component for @xmath12 is zero because mesons have baryon number zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the region where the hadron resonance gas provides a good approximation .",
    "we investigate these coefficients .",
    "the results for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2c4c6 ] .",
    "we find that these results are consistent with the prediction from the hadron resonance gas model for @xmath42 and approach the sb values , i.e. @xmath43 , @xmath44 , in the high temperature limit .",
    "also @xmath23 is negative at high temperature as expected in the perturbation theory .",
    "these results suggest that the models of free quark - gluon gas and hadron gas seem to explain the behaviour of thermodynamic quantities well except in the narrow regime near @xmath11 .",

    "dashed lines are the results from @xmath50 expansion . since the statistical error of @xmath23 is still large near @xmath11 , the location and height of the peak are less accurately determined , and also the error from the truncation of higher order terms of @xmath46 seems to be visible for large @xmath46 . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2c4c6 ] , @xmath23 changes its sign at @xmath11 .",
    "this means the peak position of @xmath12 moves left , which is corresponding to the change of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath51 in @xcite is about @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 increases with higher orders of the expansion for @xmath53 which confirms the existence of a peak .",
    "this suggests the presence of a critical endpoint in the @xmath54 plane . on the other hand , @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsus ] does not show any singular behaviour .",

    "the free energy is expected to be exponentially screened at large distances , @xmath60 .",

    "we find @xmath64 .",
