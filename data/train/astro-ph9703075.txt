    "cyclotron lines in an astrophysical x - ray spectrum are the clear signature of a superstrong magnetic field in the line - forming region .",
    "consequently , they are an important clue to the nature of the source and the properties of the emission region , especially at energies @xmath15 kev where atomic lines are not available .",
    "cyclotron lines have been important in identifying accreting magnetized neutron stars as the source of radiation in about a dozen x - ray pulsars ( mihara 1995 ; makishima and mihara 1992 ) , including her x-1 ( trmper _ et al .",

    "although the observation of spectral features in gamma - ray bursts and their interpretation continue to be controversial , they are perhaps the strongest evidence that at least some gamma - ray bursts come from strongly magnetized neutron stars associated with our own galaxy .    by building theoretical models of line - forming regions and comparing the emerging spectra with observations ,",
    "theorists have been able to infer _ quantitatively _ many properties of the sources that are believed to possess cyclotron lines .",
    "for example , mszros and nagel ( 1985 ) use a feautrier calculation to show that the spectrum of her x-1 could be produced in a region with magnetic field @xmath16=3.3 oriented parallel to the normal of a slab atmosphere with column depth ( slab width ) @xmath17 and electron temperature @xmath18=7 kev .",
    "other fits to accretion - powered pulsar spectra include those of @xcite , who infer the presence of a magnetic field approaching the critical field , @xmath19 from the spectrum of a0535 + 26 . for gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "@xcite use a monte carlo radiative transfer code ( wang , wasserman , and salpeter 1988 ; lamb _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) to show that the cyclotron lines in the spectrum of the burst gb880205 could be produced in a region with @xmath20=1.7 , @xmath21=1.2 , and with electrons at the equilibrium compton temperature , @xmath0 , which is 5.3 kev in this case .",
    "@xcite inject an initial photon distribution into a plane - parallel slab atmosphere from a source plane below the slab .",
    "here we consider both this model and one in which the photons are injected at a source plane embedded inside the slab . a slab illuminated from below may correspond to a line - forming region in the magnetosphere of a neutron star ( cf .",

    "@xcite take the magnetic field to be oriented along the slab normal , @xmath22 ( i.e. @xmath23 ) .",
    "such fields are found near the magnetic poles of neutron stars with dipole fields .",
    "kaminker , pavlov and shibanov ( 1982 , 1983 ) and @xcite consider the effects of varying the angle @xmath24 between the magnetic field and the slab normal .",
    "however , these authors do not include the effects of scattering in the cyclotron line core ( see section [ secmc ] ) ; @xcite calculate the spectrum in the continuum only , while kaminker , pavlov , and shibanov s ( 1982 , 1983 ) calculation is valid for the continuum and the line wings .    in the present work",
    ", we consider scattering in line - forming regions with @xmath25 , _ including _ core scattering .",
    "fields at angles other than @xmath23 occur when lines are formed in structures near the magnetic poles , such as accretion columns or mounds ( burnard , arons , and klein 1991 ) .",
    "line - forming regions with @xmath25 also correspond to non - polar regions on the surface or in the magnetosphere of neutron stars with dipole fields , as well as regions on stars with more complicated fields .",
    "for example , the surface of a neutron star may be threaded by local fields with various orientations relative to the local slab normal , instead of or in addition to a global dipole field ( see , e.g. , ruderman 1991a , b , c ; lamb , miller , and taam 1996 ) .",
    "we will show that if the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the slab normal ( @xmath26 ) and the photon source is embedded in the slab , the line properties are similar to those for a cylindrical line - forming region .",
    "thus a slab line - forming region with this geometry is a good approximation to the cylindrical line - forming region expected in the canonical model of accretion - powered pulsars .    in section [ seclfr ]",
    "we discuss the geometry of the line - forming regions we use in our calculations . in section [ secmc ]",
    "we describe the monte carlo radiative transfer code .",
    "we show how the equilibrium compton temperature varies with the field orientation in section [ seccompton ] . in section [ secspectra ]",
    "we present the spectra calculated by the monte carlo code and discuss the effects of the line - forming region geometry on the properties of the emergent lines .",
    "finally , in section [ secdisc ] we discuss the implications of our calculations for accretion - powered pulsars and gamma - ray bursters .",
    "the principal spatial geometry we study in this paper , a plane parallel slab , is shown in figure [ geometry]a . photons are injected at the source plane , travel through an electron - proton plasma , and emerge from one or the other of the faces of the slab .",
    "the horizontal extent of the slab is infinite .",
    "the angle @xmath27 is the polar angle of a photon s direction of propagation _ with respect to the magnetic field_. the polar angle is usually specified in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , of a photon _ with respect to the slab normal _ and @xmath31 .    as the figure shows , @xmath32 is the column depth between the top of the slab and the source plane , while @xmath33 is the column depth between the source plane and the bottom of the slab . in some circumstances",
    ", we will also specify the column depth in terms of the thomson depth , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the thomson cross section .",
    "we stress that in general the optical depth encountered by a given photon will differ from the thomson depth since the actual scattering cross section varies with photon energy , direction , and polarization .",
    "we characterize the position of the source plane by the ratio of @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , for a slab illuminated from below , as in wang _",
    "( 1989 ) , the column depth between the source plane and the bottom of the slab is zero ; we call this the 1 - 0 geometry . similarly , a slab with the source plane embedded in the middle of the slab , so that @xmath36 , has a 1 - 1 geometry .",
    "slater , salpeter , and wasserman ( 1982 ) and wang , wasserman , and salpeter ( 1988 ) determine that the mean number of scatters between the source and the top edge that a resonant photon experiences prior to escape approaches a limiting value as the atmosphere becomes semi - infinite ( i.e. as @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is generally within ten percent of its limiting value in the 1 - 1 geometry and indistinguishable from its limiting value in the 1 - 4 geometry .",
    "the corresponding mean path length the photon travels between the source and the top edge displays similar behavior , as does the median frequency shift of the escaping photon . thus the 1 - 4 geometry is an excellent approximation to a semi - infinite atmosphere .",
    "unfortunately , our monte carlo simulations show that the total number of scatters per injected photon in the 1 - 4 geometry is approximately three times the number of scatters in the 1 - 1 . the computer time required for",
    "the simulation increases proportionately .",
    "consequently , we use the 1 - 1 geometry in the present work as a compromise between the quality of the approximation to a semi - infinite atmosphere and the amount of computer time required .",
    "we refer to photons that emerge from the top of the slab as _ transmitted _ and those that emerge from the bottom as _",
    "reflected_. the former reach the observer . in the 1 - 0 geometry ,",
    "we assume that the latter return to the stellar surface where they are thermalized , i.e. , absorbed by nonresonant inverse magnetic bremsstrahlung . in the 1 - 1 geometry",
    "the reflection symmetry of the line - forming region across the source plane ensures that the transmitted and reflected spectra for isotropically injected photons are the same .",
    "we can , therefore , set the transmitted spectrum for isotropic injection equal to the _ sum _ of the transmitted and reflected spectra for _ semi_-isotropic injection . by doing so , we can reduce the computer time required per transmitted photon by an additional factor @xmath38 in the 1 - 1 geometry as compared with the 1 - 4 geometry .",
    "we also consider a cylindrical geometry , as shown in figure [ geometry]b . the length of the cylinder is infinite .",
    "we only consider magnetic fields oriented parallel to the cylinder axis , as expected in the canonical model of the emission region of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "photons are injected along the cylinder axis and emerge from the surface of the cylinder . as in the slab geometry , the angle @xmath27 is the polar angle of a photon s direction of propagation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the column depth between the cylinder axis and the surface of the cylinder is @xmath32 .",
    "our monte carlo radiative transfer code is an extended version of that used by wang _",
    "the code injects an initial photon distribution @xmath39 into an isothermal , fully ionized slab atmosphere with a uniform magnetic field at an angle @xmath24 to the slab normal .",
    "it then follows each photon through the slab and determines the emergent spectrum .",
    "the code uses resonant scattering cross sections that have been averaged over the initial polarization states and summed over the final states .",
    "@xcite argue that polarization averaged cross sections are appropriate for first harmonic scattering in optically thick media when the vacuum contribution to the dielectric tensor dominates the plasma contribution .",
    "this will be the case when",
    "@xmath40    where @xmath41 is the plasma frequency parameter , @xmath42 is the plasma frequency , @xmath43 is the cyclotron energy , @xmath44 is the magnetic vacuum polarization parameter ( see , e.g. , adler 1971 ) , and @xmath45 is the electron number density .",
    "this condition will generally hold under the physical conditions studied in this paper .",
    "we work in the cold plasma approximation , in which @xmath46 . in this approximation ,",
    "the landau level spacing is much larger than the typical electron energy so the landau levels are not collisionally populated .",
    "we further assume that the photon densities are sufficiently low so that the levels are not radiatively populated .",
    "thus , in each scattering the initial and final electron state is the landau ground state ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we denote scattering channels by the sequence of landau levels that the electron occupies , e.g. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .    in our treatment of electron - photon scattering",
    ", we adopt the approximation    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the matrix element for the @xmath53 scattering channel . in general , this approximation is a good one only near the line centers .",
    "consequently , eq . ( 2 ) is valid for line - forming regions which are not optically thick in the line wings of the first harmonic ( see below ; also wasserman & salpeter 1980 ; lamb _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , that is    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    is the polarization- , angle- , and frequency - averaged optical depth in the first harmonic ,    @xmath56    is the dimensionless natural line width ,    @xmath57    is the doppler width associated with the @xmath58 harmonic ,    @xmath59    is the radiative width for the @xmath58 harmonic , and @xmath60 is the fine structure constant .",
    "even when the line - forming region is optically thick in the line wings , eq .",
    "( [ basicassump ] ) is still a good approximation if the spectrum has an exponential rollover such that there are very few photons beyond the first harmonic .",
    "this is usually the case for the spectra of accretion - powered pulsars ( mihara 1995 ) .",
    "thus , for instance , for rollover energies of @xmath61 , the number of photons with energies significantly above the first harmonic is negligible . in this case only continuum and first harmonic scattering will be significant .",
    "however , if neither of these conditions hold , we can not ignore the cross terms when squaring the matrix element , as we have in eq .",
    "( [ basicassump ] ) . for the most part , in the present work , we confine ourselves to cases where eq .",
    "( [ basicassump ] ) is valid .",
    "however , we shall see below that when the magnetic field is parallel to the slab , photons traveling along the slab see a very large column depth _ and _ a large cross section and so can scatter multiple times with a wide range of electron velocities .",
    "some of these photons can therefore continue to scatter far in the line wings above @xmath62 where eq .",
    "( [ basicassump ] ) no longer holds . however , the range of magnetic field orientations and photon directions where this occurs is small .",
    "the scattering cross section we use is valid in the limit @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the photon energy , and the superscript @xmath66 denotes quantities measured in the frame of reference where the electron is at rest ( @xmath67 ) prior to scattering , that is , the pre - scattered electron s rest frame ( see , e.g. , daugherty and ventura 1977 ) .",

    "_ required the magnetic field to be oriented along the slab normal ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "when this is the case , the line - forming region is azimuthally symmetric .",

    "we therefore use relativistic kinematics throughout this calculation , except where we indicate otherwise .",
    "for zero natural line width , relativistic kinematics prohibits scattering at the @xmath58 harmonic above a cutoff frequency @xmath113 ( daugherty and ventura 1978 ; harding and daugherty 1991 ; see appendix of wang , wasserman , and lamb 1993 for a physical derivation ) .",
    "@xcite show that under physical conditions where electron recoil is important , photons escape more readily in the red wing than in the blue . since there was less of a focus on the blue wing , and for simplicity , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite took the resonant scattering profile to be zero for @xmath114 , ignoring the effects of the finite natural line width . for @xmath115 , the effects of finite line width",

    "we therefore calculate spectra for atmospheres at the resonant compton temperature , except where we indicate otherwise .",
    "consequently , it is important to understand how this temperature is affected by the geometry of the line - forming region .",

    "our treatment is similar but not identical to the analytic treatment of lww . in their treatment , lww used the resonant single scattering power to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "thus , their treatment depended solely on the distribution of injected photons with respect to the magnetic field ( i.e. , on the direction of the non - gyrating component of the electrons velocities ) ; it did not address the particular geometry of the scattering medium . in the present analytic treatment",
    ", we explicitly consider an optically thin slab geometry and study the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath24 . in the evaluation of @xmath0 , we assume an isothermal atmosphere which is threaded by a magnetic field whose strength is much less than the critical field @xmath123 and where the electron temperature @xmath18 is much less than @xmath124 ( we use @xmath125 throughout section [ seccompton ] ) .    to calculate the compton temperature , we require that the _ net _ power in scattered photons , that is , the scattered power minus the incident power , be equal to zero .",
    "equivalently , the heating and cooling of the atmosphere by the plasma exactly balance at @xmath126 so that the total energy change of the photons @xmath127 , which has been summed over scatters and averaged over the scattering photon distribution , is equal to zero .",

    "the increase in high @xmath105 photons that scatter is due to the increased optical depth for photons moving parallel to the field ( along the slab normal ) , and the multiple scattering of photons that were injected perpendicular to the field ( along the slab ) .",
    "while the analytic model assumes zero natural line width and includes first harmonic scattering only , the calculations shown in figure [ tcthick ] assume finite natural line width and include scattering at the first three harmonics .",
    "as shown in table [ ttemps ] , the effect of the finite line width and higher harmonics is small .",
    "as we increase the column depth to @xmath21 = 12 , we find a small _ increase _ in compton temperature , in contrast to the results of lww .",
    "the difference is due to the effects of blue wing scattering . because higher energy photons are able to scatter , the cooling of the electrons is less efficient , which raises the compton temperature .      in a closed system in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "in which the photon density is low enough that stimulated scattering can be ignored , the photons have a wien distribution with temperature @xmath187 ( see , e.g. rybicki and lightman 1979 ) .",
    "there is no net energy transfer between the photons and the electrons , and the photons have an isotropic angular distribution , i.e. @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the net photon flux .",
    "we expect that at optical depths that are large enough so that @xmath190 and the flux to density ratio , @xmath191 , the photons behave approximately as in a closed system .",

    "in addition , the mean number of scatters experienced per escaping photon , @xmath198 , and the mean energy of escaping photons ( averaged over the emerging photon distribution ; see below ) are listed .    to simulate the behavior of a system with large optical depth",
    ", we inject a wien spectrum with @xmath187 . for @xmath18",

    "we include only continuum and first harmonic scattering in these calculations .",
    "higher harmonics are not important , due to the exponential rollover in the continuum spectrum which occurs well below the first harmonic .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ basicassump ] ) with only the first term on the right hand side is a valid approximation for these simulations , even for line - forming regions that are optically thick in the line wings .",
    "as table [ tparms ] shows , at the largest optical depths , the mean energy of the transmitted photons is considerably smaller than the mean injected energy .",
    "for example , for @xmath200 and the 1 - 1 geometry , the mean energy of the transmitted photons is 15.5 kev , compared to a mean energy of @xmath201 kev for the injected photons .",
    "most of the energy redistribution occurs deep in the slab , as shown in figure [ netflux ] . here",

    "it is evident from this figure that an optical depth of @xmath206 is not sufficient for thermal equilibrium between the electrons and the photons . on the contrary ,",

    "the line wings are optically thin and there is a slight increase in @xmath202 .",
    "the reason that thermal equilibrium does not occur at @xmath206 is apparent in eq .",
    "( [ nonrescross ] ) and figure [ profile]c . for @xmath209 , the scattering profile for a @xmath210 photon decreases with energy like @xmath211 .",

    "if @xmath212 is large enough so that @xmath215 , then from eqs . ( [ classcross])-([rescross ] ) ,    @xmath216    because of the strong angle and frequency dependence of the cross section in a strong magnetic field , the use of the thomson depth to indicate optical depth in the continuum is misleading . even at @xmath206 , a significant number of photons can escape without scattering .",
    "the energy shift in figure [ netflux ] occurs because photons diffuse in angle- and frequency - space until their angle with the magnetic field is small and @xmath217 .",
    "they are then able to escape without further scattering .",
    "the importance of this redistribution is illustrated by comparing the cumulative spectrum of the emerging photons with that of the injected photons , as shown in figure [ cumspec ] .",
    "as the figure shows , even though only 14% of the photons are injected with @xmath218 kev , 45% escape below this energy .",
    "this effect could be even more pronounced if we did not use polarization - averaged cross sections ; at low energies , the scattering profile for extraordinary mode photons goes like @xmath211 , regardless of the direction they are traveling .    to test the hypothesis that the shift in the photon energies is due to the form of the scattering cross section at low @xmath65 , we ran a 1 - 1 , @xmath192 simulation in which the non - lorentzian factor was removed from the scattering cross section .",
    "as figure [ profile]f shows , without this factor , the scattering profile approaches @xmath86 as @xmath108 , so the line - forming region is no longer optically thin to low energy photons .",

    "in addition , without the non - lorentzian factor , the ratio @xmath220 remains much smaller than unity through most of the slab , as expected for a thermal distribution of photons .",
    "clearly the detailed behavior of the scattering cross section plays an important role in forming the redshifted spectrum of the escaping photons .",
    "the transfer of energy from the photons to the electrons deep in the slab implies that the electron temperature @xmath221 assumed in the calculation is less than the compton temperature at large depths .",
    "in this situation , the photons will heat the electrons until @xmath222 is reached .",
    "however , as figure ( [ netflux ] ) indicates , @xmath18 already equals @xmath222 above @xmath223 .",
    "the shape of the curve indicates that a self - consistent calculation requires a temperature profile , @xmath224 , rather than a constant value of @xmath18 throughout the slab .",

    "when the viewing angle is directly _ along _ the field ( e.g. , figures [ spectra0]a and [ spectra90]j ) , the scattering profile for the higher harmonics is dominated by the @xmath243 factor and the higher harmonics are suppressed .",

    "increasing the column depth two orders of magnitude from @xmath21=0.12 to 12 increases the width at @xmath260 from @xmath261 to 0.39 .",
    "however , keeping @xmath21 at 0.12 but rotating the field so it lies along the slab increases the equivalent width in this @xmath158 bin from @xmath261 to 0.64 .",
    "as @xmath158 approaches unity , the equivalent width decreases and can become negative .",
    "this is especially true for the 1 - 1 geometry .",

    "the presence of such a feature in an angular bin requires a surplus of photons emerging in the bin compared with the number of photons that were injected . in figures",

    ", we develop a better understanding of line shoulders by investigating how they are affected by viewing angle , spawning , electron temperature , and source plane position .",
    "@xcite shows that photons that scatter isotropically in a slab atmosphere emerge disproportionately at high @xmath158 because of the lower column depth along the slab normal .",
    "the tendency of photons to emerge at high @xmath158 is the reason the shoulders in the present calculation become more prominent as @xmath268 .",
    "the shoulders are weak or nonexistent for low @xmath158 because the enhanced column depth along the slab ensures that most photons are scattered out of the line of sight , resulting in the formation of absorption - like features .",
    "figure [ binhist ] displays monte carlo calculations of the emergent angular distribution of resonantly scattered photons .",
    "the photons are injected monochromatically at @xmath269 so that every photon scatters . as the figure shows , the number of photons _ emerging _ generally increases with @xmath158 , even though they were _ injected _ isotropically .",
    "this is true for both the 1 - 0 and 1 - 1 geometries and for fields both parallel and perpendicular to the slab normal . in the 1 - 0 geometry ( figures [ binhist]a and c )",

    "however , the shoulders are prominent in the 1 - 1 geometry even when spawning is not included in the calculation .",
    "this is because photons injected initially into the bottom half of the slab in the 1 - 1 geometry can escape through the top half after multiple scatters thereby providing an effective additional source of first harmonic photons ( see figure [ flux0 ] below and associated discussion ) .",
    "figures [ shoulders0 ] and [ shoulders90 ] also reveal that the spacing of the line shoulders is of the same order as the width of the corresponding pure absorption lines .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that in media optically thin in the line wings the shoulder spacing is given approximately by the doppler width @xmath275 times a factor @xmath276 as a result of multiple scatters ( cf .",
    "osterbrock 1962 ; wang , wasserman , salpeter 1988 ) .",
    "the relative size of the red and blue shoulders is determined by the relationship between the electron temperature and the compton temperature . at the compton temperature , by definition , the photons on average",

    "the photons on average lose more energy than they gain and the red shoulder is larger ( figures [ shoulders_vs_t]a and b ) .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite , who use a temperature ( 5.2 kev ) that is below the compton temperature , and report a slightly greater flux in the red shoulder over the blue . for @xmath278 , we find the blue shoulder is larger than the red , as expected ( figures [ shoulders_vs_t]e and f ) .",
    "the line shoulders are more prominent in the 1 - 1 geometry than in the 1 - 0 at modest optical depths because of an excess in the flux of photons near the line center in the 1 - 1 .",

    "figure [ flux0 ] shows the angle - integrated flux of photons moving upwards ( @xmath279 ) as a function of energy at four points in the slab : @xmath280=1.00 ( the source plane ) , 0.32 , 0.02 , and 0.00 ( the upper surface ) . at the source plane ,",
    "the excess of photons in the 1 - 1 geometry takes the form of a prominent peak ( figure [ flux0]d ) .",
    "the reason for the peak is that as line photons scatter , they can cross the source plane many times .",
    "the peak contains photons which were injected towards the bottom of the slab ( @xmath281 ) , but which subsequently scattered upwards and crossed the source plane ( an odd number of times , in general ) .",
    "the peak also contains photons which were injected towards the top of the slab ( @xmath282 ) , but which , in the course of multiple scatters cross the source plane twice ( or , in general , an even number of times )  once downwards and once upwards . in other words , the photon flux in the 1 - 1 geometry , like the emergent spectrum , is the sum of transmitted and reflected components ( cf .",
    "section [ seclfr ] ) .",
    "the two components contribute about equally to the peak .",
    "the peak does not appear in the 1 - 0 geometry because photons that are traveling downwards from the source plane have escaped the slab and are part of the reflected spectrum .",
    "the peak is responsible for the prominence of the shoulders in the 1 - 1 geometry .",
    "as the photons in the peak move upwards through the slab their frequencies are redistributed in multiple scatterings  they are scattered out of the line  and shoulders form .",
    "shoulders are diminished in the 1 - 0 geometry , compared to their appearance in the 1 - 1 , because there is no photon excess near the line center .",
    "note also the formation of the higher harmonic features , which , being effectively true absorption features , is essentially independent of geometry .      in sections [ ssecshapes][ssecshoulders ] we discussed the spectra emerging from line forming regions with a moderate column depth of @xmath283 .",
    "but the emission regions of accretion - powered pulsars are thought to have column depths @xmath284 . in this section",
    "we discuss our monte carlo results for the emerging spectra for slabs with column depths in this range .",
    "table [ tparms ] , above , lists the key parameters for these simulations .",
    "figure [ flux ] shows the angle - integrated flux of photons moving upwards ( @xmath279 ) as a function of energy at four points in the slab : @xmath280=1.00 ( the source plane ) , 0.32 , 0.02 , and 0.00 ( the upper surface ) .",
    "as expected , the line becomes broader and deeper as the column depth increases . at @xmath285 ,",
    "virtually no photons escape in the line core .",
    "the @xmath286 simulation shows a prominent red wing shoulder .",
    "the blue shoulder is less evident , due in part to the exponential decline of the injected spectrum above the line energy . at @xmath287 , substantial scattering in the wings",
    "significantly shifts the centroids of the shoulders and broadens them . at @xmath285 ,",
    "the slab is optically thick in the continuum .",
    "scattering in the continuum broadens the shoulders so that they are no longer discernible .",
    "the influence of the continuum can be seen in the mean number of scatters a photon experiences before escaping the slab . taking a typical @xmath288 , we see from figure [ profile ] that continuum scattering dominates below @xmath289 kev . for @xmath286 and 1,500 ,",
    "the mean energy of escaping photons is about 29 and 25 kev , respectively , so that photons escape primarily in the wings after multiple core - wing excursions ( though for @xmath286 , the wings are only marginally thick ) .",
    "the number of scatters , @xmath198 , is then dominated by core and wing scatters . since these scatters are accumulated mostly in the region where @xmath290 ( cf . figure [ netflux ] ) , @xmath198 follows the zero recoil scaling , viz , @xmath291 ( adams 1971 ; wasserman & salpeter 1980 ) . for @xmath285 ,",
    "the mean energy of escaping photons is about 15 kev , so that photons escape primarily in the continuum . in this case , photons enter the continuum after multiple core - wing excursions .",
    "since the continuum is optically thick , they can return to the wings after many scatters in the continuum and escape in the continuum after a few such continuum - wing transitions .",
    "the addition of the continuum domain breaks the @xmath292 scaling and increases @xmath198 above that expected for pure line transfer .",
    "this increase can be seen clearly in table [ tparms ] where @xmath198 for runs both with and without the continuum are listed . for @xmath293 ,",
    "core and wing scatters still dominate the total number of scatters so that @xmath292 remains good to @xmath294% . for much larger column depths , however , photons escape in the continuum only after many continuum - wing - core transitions , thereby resulting in much larger @xmath198 .",
    "thus , at @xmath295 , for instance , we find @xmath296 with the continuum turned on and about @xmath297 with it turned off .",
    "the mean energy of escaping photons in this case is about 10 kev .",
    "the number of ( line ) scatters with continuum turned off ( @xmath298 ) is less than that expected from the @xmath292 scaling ( @xmath299 ) because this scaling ignores the non - lorentzian factor ( cf .",
    "[ [ rescross ] ] ) which substantially reduces the scattering cross section at very low energies .",
    "if the radiation from an accretion - powered pulsar emerges from the stellar surface , the spectrum is similar to the spectrum emerging from a 1 - 1 line - forming region with @xmath23 .",
    "if the spectrum emerges from the sides of a cylindrical accretion column , however , it will be similar to that of a 1 - 1 line - forming region with @xmath172 viewed in the @xmath300 plane .",
    "we illustrate the latter case in figure [ cyl ] , which shows a monte carlo spectrum emerging from a cylindrical line - forming region .",
    "the magnetic field is oriented along the cylinder axis and has strength @xmath254 .",
    "the column depth , measured radially from the cylinder axis to the surface is @xmath21=1.2 .",

    "the figure shows that the cylindrical spectrum is qualitatively similar to a 1 - 1 spectrum with @xmath172 viewed in the @xmath300 plane .",
    "shoulders appear in the spectrum at small values of @xmath105 ( figure [ cyl]a ) but not large values ( figure [ cyl]d ) .",
    "the separation between the shoulder peaks is comparable to the line width for an absorption spectrum and increases as the line of sight approaches the cylinder axis due to the increase in the doppler width .",
    "we stress that the typical radial column depth expected for an accretion column is @xmath301 , much larger than the value used in figure [ cyl ] .",
    "but we expect that , as the column depth of a cylindrical line - forming region increases , the properties of the emerging spectrum continue to be similar to those of a 1 - 1 line - forming region with @xmath172 , @xmath300 , and similar column depth .",
    "specifically , the spectrum emerging from a cylindrical line - forming region with high @xmath32 should possess a cyclotron line with large equivalent width at all viewing angles , and with no visible shoulders .",
    "our understanding of how cyclotron line properties depend on geometry can provide important insights into the sources of observed cyclotron lines . it can shed light on the optical depth and location of the line - forming region in accretion powered pulsars ; for example , whether line - formation occurs in the accretion column or in a thin scattering layer located in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "understanding geometrical effects can also explain how cyclotron lines in gamma - ray bursts could be formed , e.g. , by sources in a galactic corona .",
    "constructing fully self - consistent accretion - powered pulsar models that produce spectra in agreement with observation presents many challenges .",
    "these include determining what spectrum is appropriate for the injected photons , explaining why observed accretion - powered pulsar spectra contain an excess of photons at low energies compared with a wien function , and reproducing the properties of the observed cyclotron features .    if the luminosity of the pulsar is small enough so that radiation forces are not important , the accreting material is stopped and the photons are produced at depths @xmath302 beneath the stellar surface ( miller , salpeter , and wasserman 1987 ; miller , wasserman , and salpeter 1989 ) . since the stopping depth is optically thick to ( non - magnetic ) thomson scattering , many calculations assume a wien spectrum at these depths .",
    "however , as we discussed in section [ tclarge ] , in a strong magnetic field the photons will not generally have a wien distribution at these depths .",
    "consequently , the injected spectrum needs to reflect the physics of the stopping process .    the @xmath211 dependence of the cross section for @xmath303 may play an important role in creating the photon excess at low energies .",
    "the excess in our own simulations is small compared with observations , but this is most likely due to our choice of a wien distribution for the injected photons and our neglect of the velocity of the accreting material above the stopping depth",
    ".    observed cyclotron features are broad , but shallow .",
    "for example , @xcite report a full - width half - maximum of 15.8 kev , but an equivalent width of only 10.3 kev for the line in the phase - averaged spectrum of her x-1 ( centroid at @xmath304 kev ) .",
    "in contrast , as we saw in figure [ flux ] , theoretical calculations for line - forming regions with column depths typical of accretion columns ( @xmath301 ; lamb , pethick , and pines 1973 ) generate lines which are extremely deep , with large equivalent widths .",
    "similarly , in fits to the spectra of 4u 1538 - 52 and vela x-1 , bulik _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 , 1995 ) are unable to generate sufficiently broad lines in models with constant field strength . however , using a model with two field components , differing in strength by a factor @xmath305 , they obtain acceptable fits to the data .",
    "they suggest that scattering at the lower field component could correspond to scattering in a dipole field , @xmath306 at an altitude @xmath307 , where @xmath308 is the surface dipole field strength and @xmath309 is the stellar radius .",
    "the scattering could occur in an accretion mound , as in the model of @xcite , or in a suspended scattering atmosphere , as in the model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus the spectrum could be the product of a combination of scattering near the surface and scattering in the magnetosphere .",
    "the spectral signature of the geometry of the line - forming regions can provide insight into the contribution of each region to the spectrum . at moderate optical depths , spectra formed in the 1 - 1 geometry are characterized by prominent shoulders ; these are smaller or absent in the 1 - 0 .",
    "although the prominence of the shoulders is a straightforward consequence of scattering in a semi - infinite atmosphere , shoulders have not been reported in the observed spectra of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "_ if the shoulders persist after the model spectra have been folded through the detector response matrix , and they prevent an acceptable fit to an observed spectrum , their absence in the observed spectrum could be a significant clue to the geometry of the line - forming region _  it indicates either a geometry analogous to a 1 - 0 slab with no restriction on the column depth or a geometry analogous to a 1 - 1 slab with a column depth @xmath310 .    using both 1 - 1 and cylindrical geometries , @xcite consider the effects of line shoulders on the spectrum of the accretion - powered pulsar a0535 + 26 .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) report hexe observations of 50 and 100 kev features from this pulsar at 2 and 4.5 @xmath311 respectively .",
    "osse observations by @xcite of a feature at 110 kev confirm the high energy feature reported by hexe ; the low energy feature is too close to the 45 kev osse threshold for a conclusive observation .",
    "@xcite consider the possibility that the 110 kev feature is a second harmonic line in a spectrum where the first harmonic has been filled in by the line shoulders .",
    "they fit this model to the observed spectrum , for @xmath312 ; the fit is poor compared with a model in which the 110 kev feature is the fundamental .",
    "the latter model is plausible in light of the low significance of the 50 kev feature in the hexe observation .",
    "although the column depths in araya and harding s ( 1996 ) calculation are suitable for scattering in the magnetosphere ( see below ) , they are much smaller than the column depths usually considered typical of accretion columns .",
    "the results of section [ secspectra ] in the present work , which show that the line shoulders disappear at large column depths , support the conclusion of @xcite that a0535 + 26 does not possess a @xmath313 kev first harmonic line that has been filled in by the line shoulders .",
    "however , the spectrum of a0535 + 26 could possess a @xmath313 kev first harmonic that has been mostly filled in with photons spawned by scattering at higher harmonics in a medium that is optically thick in the wings .",
    "it is difficult to assess this conjecture until second and higher harmonic scattering at such optical depths are better understood .",
    "in addition , the fact that the first harmonics observed in other accretion - powered pulsars are broad but shallow , with @xmath9 much smaller than those given by theoretical models , gives pause .",
    "in many accretion - powered pulsars , the pulse profiles are complex and strongly energy - dependent , and elude explanation by simple models .",
    "dermer and sturner ( 1991 ) and sturner and dermer ( 1994 ) suggest that some of these properties can be explained by photon scattering in the pulsar magnetosphere , in a layer of plasma supported by radiation pressure .",
    "such an atmosphere has a geometry similar to the 1 - 0 . by equating the momentum per second carried by the radiation to the gravitational force on the suspended plasma , sturner and dermer",

    "they are located at a distance of a few stellar radii from the star s center . a calculation of the _ actual _ suspended mass needs to take into account the scattering cross section , the effects of multiple scatterings , and the stability of the suspended layer .",
    "we will address these issues in a separate paper .",
    "sturner and dermer calculate the effect of scattering in the suspended plasma on the radiation _",
    "pulse profiles_. they report that the scattering flattens the pulse profiles .",
    "the flattening corresponds to the reduction in flux at the line center that we see in our monte carlo spectra . in the present work we speculate about the signature of magnetospheric scattering on the _",
    "spectrum_. if a suspended layer could be formed , spectral features formed there would have small or no shoulders , in agreement with observations . at @xmath23",
    ", it would be difficult for a layer with @xmath314 to form the broad lines required for the case of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "however , as the present work shows , broad lines are not a problem as @xmath24 approaches @xmath255 .",
    "the lines would be broadened even more if the line - forming region covers an extended region in which the magnetic field strength varies significantly .",
    "however , if the lines from an accretion - powered pulsar are formed in this way , one expects that the dipole field @xmath308 at the neutron star surface would be @xmath315 times larger than the dipole component of the field @xmath316 in the line - forming region in the magnetosphere .",
    "the field @xmath316 can be inferred from the cyclotron line energy . for most sources , such as her x-1 ,",
    "the field inferred from the cyclotron lines is _ larger _ than the dipole field inferred from the accretion torque model of ghosh and lamb ( 1979a , b ; 1991 ) , contrary to what would be expected if the lines are formed in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , it is possible that the _ non-_dipole components of the field in the line - forming region is large enough to account for the discrepancy .",
    "there are also some accretion - powered pulsars in which the field inferred from the cyclotron line energy could conceivably be much _ larger _ than the dipole surface field inferred from the accretion torque theory ( ghosh and lamb 1979a , b , 1991 ; mihara 1995 ) .",
    "the fit to the spectrum of gamma - ray burst gb880205 made by wang _",
    "( 1989 ) assumes a static line - forming region with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the slab normal . as we mention in section [ intro ] , this geometry is suitable , for example , for the magnetic polar cap of a neutron star with a dipole field .",
    "lww point out that if the line - forming region is indeed at the polar cap , the static model is valid only if the bursters lie at distances less than several hundred parsecs .",
    "otherwise , the burst luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity and the radiation force creates a relativistic plasma outflow along the field lines .",
    "however , in order to explain the brightness and sky distributions of the burst observed by batse , it has been suggested that , if the bursters are galactic , the sources are in a galactic corona at distances of 100 - 400 kpc ( for a review , see lamb 1995 ) . in light of the batse results ,",
    "it is important to explore line - formation models that are appropriate for sources at these distances .",
    "one possibility is line - formation in a relativistic outflow ( miller _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , 1992 ; isenberg , lamb , and wang 1996 ) .",

    ".    one promising line of future research is to calculate spectra for a region of a neutron star s surface large enough so that the field strength and orientation vary over the region . by comparing such calculations to observations",
    ", we can put a limit on how large a radiating area is compatible with the narrow lines found in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "there are still many open issues concerning both models .",
    "for example , for the large magnetic fields and source distances required by the galactic corona model , the optical depths for the processes @xmath317 and @xmath318 are both much larger than unity ( schmidt 1978 ; daugherty and harding 1983 ; burns and harding 1984 ; brainerd and lamb 1987 ) .",
    "the production of electron - positron pairs by these processes could lead to line - forming regions that are optically thick in the continuum , which might prevent the formation of the narrow lines observed in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in addition , pair production could truncate the spectrum at the pair production threshold , 1 mev .",
    "truncation is inconsistent with observations by comptel ( winkler _ et al .",

    "various solutions to these problems have been proposed ( for a review , see higdon and lingenfelter 1990 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the entire spectrum is produced at the magnetic polar cap in a medium with bulk motion corresponding to a lorentz factor of @xmath320 .",
    "the radiation would then be beamed into an angle @xmath321 . for corona distances , the optical depth for the two photon process",
    "would then be reduced enough to be consistent with the observed spectra above 1 mev ( schmidt 1978 ; baring and harding 1993 ; harding and baring 1994 ; harding 1994 ) .",
    "additional calculations are necessary to determine whether the observed cyclotron features could be formed at the polar cap under these physical conditions .    alternatively , the gamma - ray burst spectrum could consist of two components produced in two distinct physical regions : a soft ( @xmath322 mev ) component produced in plasma trapped in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere ( lamb 1982 ; katz 1982 , 1994 ) and a hard component ( @xmath247 mev ) produced by relativistic outflow at the magnetic polar cap .",
    "because the magnetic field traps the plasma in the line - forming region , the line - forming region can be static , even for highly super - eddington luminosities , as is the case if the bursts come from neutron stars in a galactic corona .",
    "the hard component could be produced in a relativistic pair outflow or expanding fireball at the magnetic polar cap .",
    "if so , the cross section for the two photon process is further reduced by the bulk motion of the pairs .",
