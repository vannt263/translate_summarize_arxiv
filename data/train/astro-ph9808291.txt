    "in an interesting paper , webb et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) describe an observational method for investigating possible time and space variations in the fine structure constant @xmath0 , using quasar absorption systems ( see also drinkwater et  al .",
    "webb et  al .",
    "present intriguing evidence suggesting that @xmath0 was smaller in the past ( for redshifts @xmath9 ) .",
    "the claimed fractional change is ( for @xmath10 ) , @xmath7 .",
    "since a varying value of @xmath0 can , in principle at least , have significant consequences for cosmology ( e.g.  concerning recombination ) , we examine in the present letter possible variations in @xmath0 in a broader context , although still under a particular set of assumptions . we also show that in the context of the theory presented in this paper the result obtained by webb et  al .",
    "appears to be in conflict with results of tests of the equivalence principle .",
    "the experimental constraints on variations of @xmath0 were explored extensively by bekenstein ( 1982 ) by constructing a dynamical theory relating variations of @xmath0 to the electromagnetic fraction of the mass density in the universe .",
    "bekenstein s ( 1982 ) framework for @xmath0 variability was based on _ very general assumptions _ : covariance , gauge invariance , causality , time reversal of electromagnetism , and that gravitation is described by a metric of spacetime which satisfies einstein s equations .",
    "he obtained the following equation for the temporal variation of @xmath0 ( adopting a robertson - walker metric ; we correct here a misprint in the original paper ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a length scale of the theory , @xmath14 is the total rest mass density of matter , @xmath15 is the expansion scale factor , and @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter which measures the fraction of mass in the form of coulomb energy of an average nucleon , @xmath17 , compared to the free proton mass , @xmath18 . in order to be able to integrate eq .",
    "( 1 ) , bekenstein ( 1982 ) assumed that @xmath19 ( which is affected by transformations of hydrogen into heavier nuclei in stars ) is constant .",
    "he was able to show that this assumption is reasonable up to redshifts @xmath20 , by the following consideration .",
    "the proton conversion rate ( via the reaction 4h@xmath21  he@xmath22 ) can be estimated from the mean luminosity density ( e.g.  davis , geller & huchra 1978 ) to be @xmath23  @xmath24  s@xmath25 . since a minimal nucleon number density in the universe",
    "can be determined from nucleosynthesis to be ( e.g.olive , schramm & steigman 1981 ) @xmath26  @xmath24 , the timescale for proton conversion ( and thereby for a change in @xmath19 ) is @xmath27 .",
    "the timescale for changes in @xmath14 or @xmath15 is @xmath28 .",
    "thus , for as far back as the luminosity of galaxies does not change significantly ( up to @xmath20 ) , the assumption of a constant @xmath19 is a reasonable one .",
    "however , it is interesting to push this analysis to higher redshifts ( e.g. the main change in @xmath0 claimed by webb et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) occurs at @xmath29 ) by extending bekenstein s ( 1982 ) analysis with a determination of the behavior of @xmath19 at higher redshifts .",
    "we achieve this as follows .",
    "as explained above , the rate of change of the coulomb contribution to the baryon mass depends on the rate of conversion of hydrogen into helium .",
    "following bekenstein we find : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass fractions in hydrogen and helium , respectively . in order to determine the conversion rate we adopted three possible star formation rate ( sfr ) histories for the universe : ( i )  one that follows the madau et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) curve , ( ii )  one that rises from the present up to a peak at @xmath33 and then is flat at the peak value up to @xmath34 ( as is perhaps suggested by the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment ; hauser et  al .",
    "1998 ; calzetti & heckman 1998 ) , and ( iii )  a sfr that is constant ( at the peak value ) for all redshifts ( as a limiting case ) .",
    "these star formation histories were used to synthesize a mean stellar population of the universe as a function of time , using the bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) evolutionary models .",
    "the bolometric luminosity from the mean stellar population was then used to calculate the hydrogen to helium conversion rate . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the proton conversion rate as a function of redshift up to @xmath35 , for the three assumed sfr histories .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the timescale for proton conversion satisfies @xmath36 up to @xmath35 . since @xmath37",
    ", we can still take @xmath19 to be constant in integrating eq .",
    ". indeed direct calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) shows that it varies by less than 1 % over the redshift interval that we consider .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an ( unknown ) integration constant . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) with @xmath40 and @xmath41 we find for @xmath19 the value @xmath42 ( see also bekenstein 1982 )",
    ". we will consider in the following the case of a low @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , see below ) universe .",
    "the results however would not change significantly in a @xmath45 universe .",
    "( [ eq : derivative ] ) can be integrated in time by taking into account that for @xmath46 one has @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the baryon fraction at the present time @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the critical density @xmath51 , and that @xmath52 .",
    "we find : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the planck length .",
    "we have verified that the above analytical approximation is applicable to the redshift interval of interest . as an example , in fig .",
    "2 we plot for the case @xmath55 the difference between the expression of eq .",
    "( 4 ) and the result of a direct numerical integration of eq .  (",
    "( [ eq : generalresult ] ) has two quite different regimes depending on the value of @xmath56 .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath57 which is perhaps the most physically founded since there is no a priori reason for having @xmath58 .",
    "we find : @xmath59 in order to obtain an absolute upper limit on the variability , we will assume that _ all _ the matter density is nucleonic , by taking @xmath60 ( e.g.  garnavich et  al .  1998 ; perlmutter et  al .",
    "we can also use the results of the etvs - dicke - braginsky experiments ( etvs , parker & fekete 1922 ; roll , krotkov & dicke 1964 ; braginsky & pamov 1972 ) , designed to test the equivalence principle , to infer @xmath61 .",
    "thus , our final upper limit is : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : redshiftfive }     if we assume instead that @xmath58 we can set an upper limit to @xmath63 by considering constraints on @xmath64 . from shlyakhter s ( 1976 )",
    "analysis of the oklo natural reactor we have @xmath65 .",
    "more recently , damour and dyson ( 1996 ) have derived the less strong but more robust limit of @xmath66 , which we will adopt in the following . when used in combination with eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative ] ) and with @xmath67 this gives : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : tclimits }    @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalresult ] ) becomes dominant and we obtain : @xmath69 if @xmath70 or @xmath71 otherwise .",
    "both limits , regardless of the value of @xmath39 , are at variance with the webb et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) result .",
    "the analysis of experimental constraints for the variation of the fine structure constant within the framework of rather general dynamical theories provides upper limits to any change in @xmath0 which are at variance with the webb et .",
    "al  ( 1998 ) detection .",
    "we have verified that varying the cosmological parameters ( i.e. the values of @xmath43 , @xmath72 , primordial helium fraction ) does not affect our constraints significantly .    we should note that variations in @xmath0 in the context of the theory discussed in the present paper result in no modifications to the planckian spectrum of black body radiation .",
    "in fact one could think of varying @xmath0 as a varying permittivity of the vacuum .",
    "this would simply be equivalent to changing the expansion factor @xmath73 to a different function , which can not modify the planck spectrum .",
    "variations of the fine structure constant @xmath0 could be driven also by a different dynamics . in theories with extra dimensions ( e.g. , kaluza - klein or superstrings theories ) variations in the observed value of @xmath0 can be induced by variations in the length scale of the compact dimensions ( see , e.g. , marciano 1984 , barrow 1987 ) .",
    "the effects of extra dimensions were discussed in detail by barrow ( 1987 ) who found upper limits to @xmath74 of @xmath75 for both kaluza - klein and superstring theories .",
    "this upper limit is also much smaller than the claimed detection by webb et .",
    "al(1998 ) .",
    "however , note that in these theories the variations of all physical constants are inter - related .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the calculations leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalresult ] ) would have to be modified if a significant component of the dark matter in the universe were to decay electromagnetically at redshift @xmath29 ( e.g.  sciama 1982 , 1997 ) .",
    "we hope that the present letter will inspire more attempts to determine possible variations of @xmath0 observationally .",
