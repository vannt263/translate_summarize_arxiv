    "topological matters have attracted enormous attention in recent years because they can host exotic edge or surface states protected by nontrivial bulk topology .",
    "topological insulators , as well known examples , are characterized by a fully insulating gap in the bulk and symmetry protected metallic states on the boundaries @xcite . nowadays",
    ", the research interest in topological materials has moved in part from insulators to semimetals as semimetals with topologically non - trivial fermi surfaces can also support robust surface states . in general , the bulk band structures of topological semimetals possess point or line nodes in momentum space @xcite .",
    "3d dirac semimetal is one class of topological semimetals with four - fold degenerate point nodes and the electrons have linear dispersions near the dirac nodes .",
    "na@xmath0bi @xcite and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 @xcite have been experimentally confirmed to be topological dirac semimetals , where the dirac nodes are protected by crystalline symmetry .",
    "if inversion or time - reversal symmetry is broken , each dirac node splits into two weyl nodes , separated in the momentum space , and the systems become weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "weyl nodes with distinct chiralities lead to a variety of exotic measurable consequence , such as fermi arc surface states and chiral anomaly .",
    "weyl semimetals have become a hot topic because the real weyl semimetal materials has been theoretically proposed @xcite and experimentally discovered in the inversion symmetry breaking taas class crystal @xcite .",
    "differently from the dirac / weyl semimetals where the conduction band touches the valence band at discrete points in the momentum space , the conduction and valence bands in topological line - node semimetals touch each other on closed lines and symmetry protected drumhead surface states emerge @xcite .",
    "recently , several theoretical proposals @xcite and experimental studies",
    "@xcite appeared on line - node materials .",
    "since the dimension of line nodes is different from that of point nodes in dirac / weyl semimetals , one expects that line - node semimetals exhibit new topological transport and response phenomena characteristic to line nodes .",
    "several works , indeed , have shown novel phenomena in line - node semimetals , e.g. , the minimal conductivity @xcite , quantized hall conductivity @xcite , flat landau level @xcite , plasmons @xcite , and electric polarization and orbital magnetization @xcite .",
    "one way to realize nontrivial transport phenomena in semimetals is to irradiate the materials by light .",
    "dirac / weyl semimetals in the presence of circularly polarized light have been theoretically studied within the framework of floquet theory @xcite .",
    "the circularly polarized light couples to electrons in a nontrivial form : the angular momentum of the incident light interacts with that of an electron which can break the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the anomalous hall effect due to the light - induced interaction , which is called photovoltaic anomalous hall effect @xcite , occurs when the fermi level is located near the weyl nodes .    in this paper",
    ", we study the transport phenomena of line - node semimetals in the presence of circularly polarized light within the framework of floquet theory .",
    "we find that the light - induced interaction in line - node semimetals , unlike that in the dirac / weyl semimetals @xcite , has strong dependence on the direction of incident light and highly anisotropic .",
    "we present that photovoltaic anomalous hall effect in line - node semimetals with time reversal and inversion symmetries , such as in ca@xmath0p@xmath1 @xcite , can be generated by applying circularly polarized light .",
    "we calculate the hall conductivity @xmath2 as functions of fermi level @xmath3 and temperature .",
    "it is found that for @xmath4 , which means the fermi level is located at line node , the hall conductivity depends on the radius of the line - node but it does not depend on the strength of the light - induced interaction . for @xmath5 ,",
    "on the other hand , the hall conductivity depends both the radius of the line - node and the strength of light - induced interaction . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 is sensitive to @xmath3 in the presence of a weak intensity of the incident light .",
    "we consider a line - node semimetal with time - reversal and spatial - inversion symmetries which can be described by a minimal two - band model . in the absence of applied electromagnetic field , the low - energy effective model hamiltonian of line",
