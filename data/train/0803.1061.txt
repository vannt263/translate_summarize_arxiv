    "there have been several radar observations of enhanced plasma and ion lines at the topside ionosphere during ground based heating experiments in which the transmitting frequency has been kept somewhat lower than the critical plasma frequency of the f2 layer maximum .",
    "a proposed explanation for the observed topside plasma and ion lines is a nonlinear decay of large amplitude z mode waves , which have been mode converted from the o mode heater wave at the bottomside of the ionosphere , into langmuir and ion acoustic ( ia ) waves .",
    "the observations have attracted much interest since both the ordinary ( o ) and fast extraordinary ( x ) electromagnetic waves are reflected at or below the critical region where @xmath0 , except at a very narrow angular range around the critical angle of incidence ( the spitze angle ) where the o mode wave is mode converted to z mode waves @xcite .",

    "similar observations at eiscat were done in the e region by @xcite , where there were no clear dependence of the power of the topside echoes on the power of the plasma turbulence at the bottomside .",
    "there are several observations at eiscat of topside echoes over an angular range of several degrees @xcite . in the experiment at eiscat by @xcite , which was performed with low duty cycle ( 200 ms every 10 s ) , topside excitation of ion and plasma lines were also observed in a angular range of many degrees from the spitze angle , including vertical incidence . in order for normally incident o wave to tunnel through the f peak , conversion of the o mode to the z mode should occur , and the following conditions are necessary .",
    "first , that the transmitter frequency should be near the maximum plasma frequency of the f peak so that @xmath7 for the peak plasma frequency of the f layer , as discussed by @xcite and shown in the linear e - region simulations for a parabolic density profile @xcite .",
    "second , the existence of the density / electric field fluctuations within the critical layer , which can occur due to the generation of electrostatic turbulence excited by the parametric instability or in the earlier phase of the nonlinear thermal self - focusing instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the topside plasma and ion lines could be due to resonant scatter of the hf pump wave into z mode waves on the small - scale magnetic field aligned striations , which in turn are created by the hf pump wave via the resonant instability , or , in the case of the low duty cycle experiments with pump frequencies near a multiple of the electron gyro frequency , due to a second - order four wave interaction @xcite .",
    "rocket observations during heating experiments in arecibo @xcite revealed z mode waves and field aligned striations above the o mode reflection point , and evidence of generation of bernstein waves where the local plasma frequency matches an electron gyro harmonic .    during experiments where the eiscat uhf beam was directed along the magnetic field lines , @xcite discovered spectra with an unusually large spectral width ( up to 200 khz ) and a mean frequency shifted by 200 - 300 khz away from the heating frequency in both the upshifted and downshifted channels .",
    "this feature has been named the hf - induced outshifted line ( hfol ) .",
    "the hfol spectra come from a height about 3 - 6 km above the reflection height .",
    "@xcite propose that the hfol feature can be consistently explained if the upper region is the reflection layer of the z mode appearing due to the mode conversion at the reflection level of the injected o mode wave .",
    "their scenario includes large - scale density depletions at the airy maxima of the z mode , the parametric decay of the z mode into electron bernstein and lower hybrid waves @xcite , and the production of suprathermal electrons by the electrostatic turbulence , which in turn excite langmuir waves inside the density depletions , yielding the hfol .",
    "the interaction between the electromagnetic pump wave and the electrostatic turbulence have been modeled with zakharov - type equations @xcite and wave kinetic equations @xcite , to understand the wave spectra and radiation generation from electromagnetically driven langmuir turbulence @xcite . in this letter",
    "we analyze the conversion of o mode waves into z mode waves and the generation of topside ionospheric turbulence numerically with a full - scale simulations of a generalized zakharov model @xcite based on a nested grid method @xcite .",
    "we are using realistic length scales and ionospheric parameters relevant for the high - latitude facility eiscat near troms , norway , but similar parameters may be also found at high - latitude facilities such as haarp , alaska and hipas , near fairbanks , alaska .",
