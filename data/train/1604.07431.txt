    "unidentified extragalactic variable x - ray sources with extended emission at radio and optical wavelengths are often associated to active galactic nuclei ( agns * ? ? ? * ) or ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "multiwavelength analyses , from radio to gamma - ray are needed to disentangle and characterise the different components and nature of such astrophysical systems .    of particular interest",
    "is the x - ray source 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 , located within the spiral galaxy ngc300 , belonging to the nearby sculptor group of galaxies .",
    "it was first studied by @xcite , who suggested an x - ray binary nature for the source , based on hardness - ratio values and its variable behaviour obtained from observations performed with the high resolution imager of _",
    "rosat_. later on , @xcite showed that the source ( named xmm5 in their work ) presents a radio counterpart ( atca j005450.3@xmath12373850 ) , whose extended radio emission may be the result of synchrotron radiation from jets , possibly associated to an extragalactic microquasar .",
    "a study of the global properties of x - ray point sources in ngc300 , and their optical counterparts was performed by @xcite , who associated the source ( named source 7 in their work ) with an apparently extended optical counterpart .    in this paper , we report results of a combined optical and x - ray analysis using archival data of the hst , xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observatories , together with new optical spectroscopic _ gemini _ observations , of the extragalactic x - ray source 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 , and we provide convincing evidence about its true nature as a seyfert-2 agn galaxy located at @xmath13 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect.2 we describe _ hubble _ , _ gemini _ , xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations and data reduction .",
    "optical / x - ray analysis and results are shown in sect.3 .",
    "finally , in sect.4 , we discuss the implications of our results and summarise our main conclusions .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ spectable ]     + error values are 1-@xmath14 ( 68% ) for every single parameter and unabsorbed fluxes in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev energy range are given in units of 10@xmath15  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath10 .",
    "parameters indicated with a @xmath16 were tied between each other during the fit .",
    "model i corresponds to values of @xmath17 tied and model ii to values of @xmath3 tied , respectively .",
    "spectra for 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 were taken with the gemini multiobject spectrograph ( gmos ) at the gemini south telescope under the program gs-2015b - dd-6 ( pi : j. combi ) .",
    "we have adopted a single long - slit of width @xmath18 to obtain the spectra of the target .",
    "we used the r400@xmath19g5325 grism and obtained five exposures of 1200s in two different central wavelengths ( three in 6700  and two in 6500 ) .",
    "this setup resulted in a spectral coverage of 42009050  and a resolution ( defined as @xmath20fwhm measured in some emission lines of the cuar arc lamps spectra ) @xmath21 .",
    "the flat - field frames were observed at the same position of the target .",
    "the cuar arc lamps were observed as day - time calibrations , thus flexures can introduce some systematic uncertainties in the wavelength calibration which are not important to the aims of this work .",
    "the observations were reduced using the gemini package within iraf .",
    "we checked the position of 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 in chandra observations running the wavdetect task which throwed @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( j2000.0 ) with a positional uncertainty of @xmath18 .",
    "this value agrees very well with the values reported by @xcite on their 3xmm - dr5 catalogue : @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( j2000.0 ) with a @xmath26 position error .",
    "we also used the srcextent ciao task to calculate the size of the source , which resulted point - like at chandra resolution .    in order to analyze the physical properties of the x - ray emission detected from 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 in detail , we extracted spectra from circular regions centered at the position of the source for both xmm - newton and chandra observations . for xmm-_newton _ data",
    ", spectra were obtained in the 0.5@xmath1212 kev energy range , for radii of @xmath27 using evselect sas task with the appropriate parameters for epic mos  1/2 and pn cameras , and ancillary and response matrices were created using arfgen and rmfgen tasks , respectively . for the spectral extraction in mos1/2 and pn cameras we selected events with flag = = 0 . in the case of _ chandra _ data , we extracted spectra using radii of @xmath28 by means of the specextract ciao task . for both telescopes ,",
    "background spectra were extracted from annuli regions centered at the position of the source and the spectra were grouped with a minimum of 16 counts per bin .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the xspec package version 12.8 @xcite in the 0.58.0  kev energy range , where the source is detected .",
    "we simultaneously fitted the spectra obtained with the xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ detectors , using a power - law ( pl ) model modified by interstellar absorption ( phabs ; * ? ? ? * ) . in order to fit the data we used to alternatives . in model",
    "i , we tied the hydrogen column density , @xmath2 , of all observations allowing to vary freely the spectral indices , @xmath3 , and their normalizations , while , in model ii , we tied @xmath3 , allowing to vary the @xmath17 . for model i ,",
    "the best fit model returned an hydrogen column density @xmath29@xmath6 and power - law indices varying from @xmath42 , for obs . 1 and 2 , to 1.481.65 for obs . 3 to 6 , with a total @xmath30 of 216.18 for 226 d.o.f .",
    "unabsorbed x - ray fluxes in the 0.58.0  kev energy range run from 0.145 to 0.057 @xmath31  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath10 . for model ii , the best fit corresponds to a spectral index @xmath32 , and absorption columns varying from @xmath33  @xmath6 , for obs . 1 and 2 , to @xmath34@xmath6 , for obs .",
    "3 to 6 , with a total @xmath35 of 229.67 for 226 d.o.f .",
    "unabsorbed x - ray fluxes in the 0.58.0  kev range show a similar behaviour to model i , being independent to the chosen model .",
    "the available data do not allow us to adequately fit the whole set of spectra leaving all the parameters untied , as there are no enough statistics .",
    "however , in both cases we observe the presence of a long - term x - ray variability .",

    "we show the corresponding full 2000 - 2014 unabsorbed x - ray light curve in the 0.5 - 8.0  kev energy range . on the right panel of figure  [ fig_lc ]",
    "we display the spectral results from model ii . on its upper panel ,",
    "we show the evolution of the absorption column @xmath17 , while on its lower panel we plot the corresponding x - ray light curve in the same ranges .",
    "although a few years of data are missing ( 2001 - 2005 ) , in both cases the source displays at least two different states .",
    "regardless of the model chosen , the unabsorbed flux evolution shows the same behaviour which confirms the long - term x - ray variability of the source . to make this clear , on figure  [ fig_spectra ] we show background - subtracted pn spectra of xmm-_newton _ observations 1 and 4 of 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 as fitted by the absorbed power - law model .",
    "figure  [ fig : imghst ] shows the hst images of the field surrounding 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 in the aforementioned three filters .",
    "the chandra x - ray contours are overlaied in fig.[fig : imghst ] , left panel .",
    "as it can be seen , the x - ray source is positionally coincident with the geometrical centre of the extended optical source , whose morphology clearly matches an r@xmath38-type ring galaxy , in which two outer pseudorings are conspicuous .",
    "these features are thought to arise from gaseous rings that developed at the outer lindblad resonances in a spiral galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the optical source also displays a barely resolved nuclear component ( which we associate with a bulge plus an unresolved nucleus ) , located at the centre of an `` oval '' , with hints of spiral structure , and two `` hot - spots '' , clearly seen in the @xmath39-band image at position angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( i.e. , almost at diametrically opposite sides of the nucleus ) .",
    "the inner disk ( the `` oval '' feature ) has an ellipticity @xmath42 and a position angle @xmath43 , spanning @xmath44 and @xmath45 along its major and minor axes , respectively .",
    "the pseudorings , in turn , present an angular size of @xmath46 on the plane of the sky .      in fig .",
    "[ sp ] , we show the gmos spectrum over the spectral range 55008500  .",
    "emission lines of h , , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] were identified in the spectrum and measured for radial velocities .",
    "we obtained a mean @xmath47 ( 13 measurements ) .",
    "we have also identified some absorption lines of , , and the g - band .",
    "five absorptions gave a @xmath48 ( 5 values averaged ) , thus they are originated at the same distance as the emission lines .",
    "the spectrum presents hydrogen and forbidden lines of the same width with a mean @xmath49 km  s@xmath10 , compatible with a seyfert  2 galaxy spectrum .",
    "also , the ratio h@xmath50 and [ ] @xmath515007 is 0.1 ( typical in sy  2 , following * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also measured the @xmath52 of the emission lines in the spatial dimension .",
    "all of them resulted similar to the @xmath52 of the whole trace of the spectrum , thus the spectral source should be considered as point - like ( at least , considering the seeing - limited gemini s spatial resolution ) .",
    "through this paper , for the first time , we present a deep study of the x - ray source 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 an its optical counterpart to unveil its real nature .",
    "the information gathered in the previous sections from the optical and x - ray analysis shows that 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 poses typical characteristics of a seyfert-2 agn galaxy , located at @xmath0 behind ngc300 , as demonstrates the optical spectroscopic observations that we obtained with gemini .",
    "the x - ray source is positionally coincident with the central region of an extended optical source detected with hst showing a complex structure , that clearly matches the morphology of a r@xmath38-type spiral galaxy with a conspicuous outer pseudo - rings structure .",
    "the positional correlation strongly suggests a physical association between both sources .",
    "we also note that this galaxy is unrelated to either of the two clusters detected in the background of ngc300 ( schirmer et al .",
    "2003 ) , with measured redshits @xmath53 ( cappi et al . 1998 ) and @xmath54 ( collins et al .",
    "1995 ) , respectively .",
    "the object s redshift implies a luminosity distance @xmath55mpc and a spatial scale 3.606 kpc/@xmath56 ( we made use of ned wright s _ _ cosmology calculator _ _ , with standard cosmological parameters : @xmath57kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the ( projected ) major axis of the pseudo - rings system is thus @xmath60kpc , while the surface brightness profile of the inner `` oval '' feature can be fit by an exponential with a scale - length of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 kpc ) in the @xmath63-band ( rest - frame @xmath64-band ) .",
    "the rings are resolved into several `` knots '' with apparent magnitudes ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 mag ( @xmath67 ) and relatively red colours ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus , they are probably large star - forming complexes ( the h@xmath69 emission falls within the f814w passband at the object s redshift ) , significantly reddened by the intervening dust in the disc of ngc300 .",
    "though a small fraction of observed rings may be due to collisions or mergers of galaxies , or to accretion of intergalactic gas , the vast majority of rings are probably simple resonance phenomena , caused by the actions of a rotating bar or other non - axisymmetric disturbance on the motions of gas clouds in the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , outer pseudo - rings are in fact spiral arms with a very low pitch angle , winding upon themselves following the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) .",
    "these features are quite common in seyfert galaxies @xcite , and it has been suggested that galaxies with outer ( pseudo)rings tend to display enhanced nuclear star formation @xcite ; however , the real dependence of agn activity on the global structure of the host galaxy is still debated @xcite .",
    "the information obtained from the optical data are in accordance with the results of our temporal and spectral x - ray analysis of 3xmm j005450.3@xmath12373849 , where we have shown that the source was in two different states , showing typical agn variability .",
    "the x - ray spectra available were best - fitted using an absorbed power - law model , with absorption columns in the @xmath70  @xmath6 range and spectral indices of 1.52 typical of agns . in the 20002001 period ,",
    "the source showed the highest flux , reaching 0.120.14 @xmath31  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath10 .",
    "contrarily , during the 20052010 period , the source was fainter with a flux of @xmath40.06 @xmath31  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath10 with a higher absorption , returning to a brighter state in the last 20102014 period . taking into account the derived unabsorbed x - ray fluxes of the source , assuming a 1110  mpc distance to the source , we compute x - ray luminosities in the @xmath48@xmath7110@xmath72 to 2@xmath7110@xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 range for the 0.58.0  kev energy band , for any of the spectral models assumed , which correspond to a weak agn with little obscuration @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that considering an @xmath73 for ngc300 @xcite and assuming @xmath74 , we deduce an @xmath75 .",
    "thus , following @xcite we obtain a total absorption column @xmath76  @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the best fit values obtained for the absorption columns in both spectral models are at least a factor of 5 higher than the foreground material .    in any case , this particular galaxy has signatures of strong star formation activity , as well as of an agn .",
    "the two hot spots , as said , are prominent in the f435w image ( which corresponds to the @xmath77-band at the source rest - frame ) .",
    "such spots , roughly aligned on opposite sides of the nucleus , are associated to strong ongoing star - formation , as is the case of other well - studied starburst galaxies ( e.g. , m94 ; * ? ? ?",
