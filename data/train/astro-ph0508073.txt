    "+ absorption modifies the intrinsic source spectrum according to @xmath3 . the optical depth @xmath4 is obtained by convolving the ebl photon density distribution @xmath70 with the pair production cross - section @xmath71 , and integrating over the @xmath0-ray photon path from the source to the observer :      ( where @xmath73 is the proper line element , @xmath71 is already integrated over angles for an isotropic field of background photons , and the photon density and energies depend on redshift ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath4 strongly depends on the spectrum of the background photons ( see e.g. ref[19 ] ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 ( or equivalently the ebl sed @xmath75 ) , the optical depth appears constant with energy , while for @xmath76 ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) , the optical depth @xmath78 . note that in the first case , the observed spectrum simply reproduces the spectrum emitted by the source , attenuated by a constant factor .",
    "+ the energy dependence of the optical depth translates to strong modifications of the source spectrum even with relatively small differences in @xmath10 , due to the exponential dependence .",
    "for example , given an intrinsic power - law spectrum @xmath79 , a difference of only one unit in @xmath10 between 0.2 and 1 tev increases the spectral index by @xmath80 .",
    "figure si-1 shows the attenuation factor as a function of energy in four relevant cases ( p1.0 , p0.4 , p0.4+e@xmath14 , p1.0+uv ) .",
    "+ for a @xmath0-ray photon of a given energy @xmath81 , because of the threshold effect ( @xmath82 ) , only ebl photons of energy above threshold ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) contribute to the absorption . also , because of the relative narrowness of the @xmath84 cross - section , for broad - band ebl spectra more than half of the interactions occur with a narrow interval of target photons @xmath85 ( ref[6,19 ] ) around the cross - section peak , where @xmath86 ( this relation is illustrated on the upper axis in fig .",
    "si-3 and si-4 , as a guideline ) .",
    "thus , the optical depth at @xmath87 tev is controlled only by the ebl fluxes at uv ",
    "o wavelengths ( below 1  micron ) , since nir photons are below the energy threshold , while the optical depth at @xmath88 tev is controlled mainly by the nir flux .",
    "the uv  o band has a more limited impact on @xmath88 tev photons since the interactions occur far from the cross - section peak .",
    "an increase or decrease of the uv  o flux alone changes the optical depth at 0.2 tev much more than at 1 tev .",
    "+ therefore , it is possible to reduce the energy dependence of the optical depth ( and thus to avoid the hard reconstructed spectra ) by assuming either very low o  nir fluxes ( reducing @xmath10 at tev energies ) or very high uv  o fluxes ( increasing @xmath10 at sub - tev energies ; e.g. , see fig .",
    "si-1 , right panel ) .",
    "+ these two new objects provide significantly stronger constraints on the ebl than any previous tev blazar because of a favourable combination of hard observed spectrum and relatively high redshift . for sources at smaller redshifts @xmath7 is smaller , while at the same redshift a softer spectrum can be misinterpreted as a hard spectrum which has been more heavily absorbed .",
    "both cases allow the ebl to have a wider range of possible fluxes without yielding implausible values in the reconstructed blazar spectrum .",
    "this is the reason why the tev spectra of the two previous most distant objects , 1es 1426 + 428 [ 11 ] ( z=0.129 , @xmath89 ) and pks 2155@xmath1304 [ 10 ] ( z=0.116 , @xmath90 ) , did not provide such strong constraints as these two new sources , even when measured with much higher signal - to - noise ratio ( pks2155@xmath1304 ) .",
    "the intrinsic spectra of h1426 + 428 and pks 2155@xmath1304 start to become very hard ( @xmath91 ) for ebl fluxes around p1.0+e@xmath14 and above .",
    "+ the determination of an ebl limit from gamma - ray spectra needs to take into account the statistical and systematic errors of the spectral determination , which amount for these data  at the 1@xmath49 level  to @xmath92 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the absolute energy scale of cherenkov telescopes is only determined to @xmath93% .",

    "value , and the photon energies lower . using the same @xmath22 limit on the intrinsic spectrum",
    ", these errors can be translated into an equivalent uncertainty for the scaling factor p : namely , by finding the values for which @xmath94 , and shifting the bin energies @xmath95% . for the 1es1101@xmath1232 spectrum , which provides the most stringent constraints ,",
    "the errors in @xmath9 translate to @xmath96 ( the relation is linear , and is approximately @xmath97 ) , and the energy scale error into @xmath98 .",
    "all three contributions ( @xmath99 statistical , @xmath100 systematic , @xmath95% energy scale uncertainty ) combined yield @xmath26 .",
    "+ in the calculation of the optical depth , we have not included the effects of galaxy evolution between @xmath101=@xmath102 and @xmath103 to 0.186 .",
    "that is , we assume a constant ( rather than decreasing with redshift ) ebl co - moving energy density .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that all the background photons seen today were already in place at the source redshift . to estimate the impact of this approximation in the redshift range considered here",
    ", we used the model by primack [ 12 ] in 2001 , interpolating a set of ebl seds as a function of redshift ( kindly provided by the authors ) .",
