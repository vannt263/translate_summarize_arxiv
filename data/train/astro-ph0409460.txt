    "the results are often difficult to interpret .",
    "the problem of @xmath14 neutrinos crossing the earth is indeed quite complicated because of the complex terrestrial neutrino opacity at different energies and angles of arrival .",
    "in addition , several factors have to be taken into account , such as the amount of energy transferred in the @xmath19 - @xmath14 lepton conversion , as well as the @xmath14 energy losses and interaction lengths at different energies and materials .",
    "this makes the estimate of the links between the input neutrino - output @xmath14 air shower very difficult .",
    "such a prediction is further complicated by the existence of a long list of theoretical models for the incoming neutrino fluxes ( gzk neutrinos , z - burst model flux , @xmath20 flat spectra , agn neutrinos , topological defects ) .",
    "many authors have investigated this @xmath15 signature by their convolution of flux models and the earth new opacity ; however the results are varied , often in contradiction among themselves , and the expected rates may range over a few order of magnitude ( fargion , aiello , & conversano 1999 ; fargion 2002 ; bertou et al . 2002 ; feng et al .",

    "so far , the majority of the current studies on this topic is based on monte - carlo simulations assuming a particular model of the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "most of the authors focus on the uptaus tracks in underground detectors .",
    "to face such a complex problem , we considered the simplest approach : first we disentangle the incoming neutrino flux from the consequent @xmath14 air - shower physics ; therefore , to establish the @xmath14 production rate we introduce an effective volume and mass for earth - skimming @xmath14 s , which is independent on any incoming neutrino flux model .",
    "this volume describes a strip within the earth crust where neutrino / antineutrino - nucleon , @xmath21 , interactions may produce emerging @xmath22 leptons which then shower in the atmosphere outside the earth .",
    "we present a very simple analytical and numerical derivation ( as well as its more sophisticated extensions ) which takes into account , for any incoming angle , the main processes related to the neutrinos and @xmath14 leptons propagation and the @xmath14 energy losses within the earth crust .",
    "our numerical results are constrained by upper and lower bounds derived in simple approximations ( see fargion et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "the effective volumes and masses will be more severely reduced at high energy because we are interested in the successful development of the @xmath14 air - shower .",
    "therefore we included as a further constraint the role of the air dilution at high altitude , where @xmath14 decay and the consequent air - shower may ( or may not ) take place .",
    "we showed ( fargion et al .",
    "2004 ) that our results give an estimate of the @xmath14 air - shower event rates that exceeds earliest studies but they were comparable or even below more recent predictions ( yoshida et al .",
    "2004 ) . secondly , we point out here , for the first time , that the consequent @xmath7 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 signature of hortaus largely differs from that of horizontal uhecr backgrounds .",
    "finally we introduce in the calculation of the number of events an additional suppression factor related to the altitude at which air showers are observed .",
    "this guarantees the optimal extension and the largest flux for the shower to be detected at each observational @xmath24 altitude .     and",
    "@xmath25 for rock and water .",
    "as one can see from the picture , @xmath26 is shorter than @xmath25 at energies above @xmath27 ev , thus it corresponds to a smaller effective volume where @xmath28 s are produced while keeping most of the primary neutrino energy .",
    "the energy label on the x axis refers to the newly born tau for @xmath29 : @xmath30,width=207 ]",
    "to calculate the effective volume we assume that the neutrino traversing the earth is transformed in a tau lepton at a depth @xmath31 , after having travelled for a distance ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "the angle @xmath36 is included between the neutrino arrival direction and the tangent plane to the earth at the observer location ( @xmath37 corresponds to a beam of neutrinos tangential to the earth s surface ) and it is complementary to the nadir angle at the same location .",

    "as we will show in the next section , the probability for the outcoming @xmath14 to emerge from the earth keeping its primary energy @xmath41 is @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 at energy @xmath46 ev ) . by the interaction length",
    "@xmath47 we mean the characteristic length for neutrino interaction ; as we know its value may be associated to the inverse of the total cross - section @xmath48 , including both charged and neutral current interactions .",
    "it is possible to show that using the @xmath49 in the @xmath39 factor includes most of the @xmath50 regeneration along the neutrino trajectory making simpler the mathematical approach .",
    "indeed the use of the total cross - section in the opacity factor above must be corrected by the multi - scattering events ( a neutral current interaction first followed by a charged current one later ) ; these additional @xmath51 events ( `` regenerated taus '' ) are summarized by the less suppressing @xmath49 factor in the @xmath52 opacity term . the only difference between the real case and our very accurate approximation is that we are neglecting a marginal energy degradation ( by a factor @xmath53 ) for only those `` regenerated taus '' which experienced a previous neutral current scattering .",
    "we also neglected all the charged current events deep inside the earth whose tau lepton birth and propagation is source of lower energy tau neutrinos which pile up at energy @xmath27 ev and below ; such a @xmath19 regeneration ( absent in @xmath54 or @xmath55 cases ) may be here neglected because of its marginal role in the range of energy ( @xmath56 ev ) we are interested in .",
    "therefore our estimates give a lower bound for the detection of @xmath14 air showers from uhe @xmath19 skimming the earth .",
    "the rarer short range decay of uhe @xmath14 inside the earth , with a marginal energy loss , may be an additional source of `` uhe regenerated '' @xmath19 even at energy @xmath57-@xmath58 ev ; their additional contribution ( here neglected ) will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the curves obtained ( the red line for an earth outer layer made of water and the pink line for the rock ) are compared with a simplified model of the earth , considered as an homogeneous sphere of water ( green line ) and rock ( blue line ) .",
    "here we used the interaction length @xmath59 and the volume is expressed as a function of the final tau energy . note that above @xmath60 km@xmath61 the effective mass - volume in the energy range 3 @xmath62 10@xmath63 - 10@xmath64 ev is larger than the volume of the atmospheric layer , whose ability to convert downward neutrino in observable air shower is negligible . only horizontal neutrino interaction in the atmosphere may be detected , at a much lower rate than the hortaus ones.,width=196 ]    the effective volume per unit surface is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is any arbitrary surface above the corresponding effective volume .",
    "for instance this expression has been first estimated for all the earth . in this case",
    "a is just half of the terrestrial surface , due to the request of selecting only the upward direction .    under the assumption that the @xmath31 depth is independent of @xmath47 and @xmath67 ,",
    "the above integral becomes :    @xmath68    where the energy of the neutrino @xmath38 has been expressed as a function of @xmath69 via the introduction of the parameter @xmath70 , the fraction of energy transferred from the neutrino to the lepton . at energies greater than @xmath71",
    "ev , when all mechanisms of energy loss are neglected , @xmath72 , meaning that the 80% of the energy of the incoming neutrino is transferred to the newly born @xmath14 after the @xmath73 scattering ( gandhi 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "when the energy losses are taken into account , the final @xmath14 energy @xmath74 is a fraction of the one at its birth , @xmath41 .",
    "their ratio @xmath75 is related to @xmath76 by the following expression    @xmath77    this ratio defines the fraction of energy of the outgoing @xmath14 compared to the incoming @xmath19 .",

    "the terrestrial chord , @xmath88 shown in fig . [ dteta ] , is responsible for the @xmath89 opacity , and @xmath90 is the interaction length for the incoming neutrino in a water equivalent density , where @xmath91 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that both @xmath90 and @xmath92 , converted into the water equivalent chord , depend on the number density @xmath93 ( and the relative matter density @xmath94 of the inner shell tracks ) .",
    "in reality the earth interior has been idealized as an homogeneous sphere of water of column depth @xmath95 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ dteta ] ) and the interactions are considered for the water density .",
    "we remind that the total neutrino cross section @xmath96 consists of two main component , the charged current and neutral current terms , but the @xmath97 production depends only on the dominant charged current whose role will appear later in the event rate number estimate .",
