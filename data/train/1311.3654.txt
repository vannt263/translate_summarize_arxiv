    "the atlas and cms collaborations at cern are trying to determine whether the discovered boson is the expected standard model ( sm ) higgs  @xcite .",
    "they do this by examining its couplings to other particles .",
    "so far it appears to be very sm like , however there are discrepancies .",
    "one such discrepancy might be the coupling to two photons .",
    "the atlas collaboration measures the rate at which the higgs decays to two photons to be above the predicted sm rate  @xcite while the cms collaboration measures a defect in different productions  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs does not couple to photons at tree level , but only through loops of charged particles .",
    "any model introducing new charged particles which couple to the higgs has the potential to greatly affect the coupling to photons , since they enter at the same order . at this point ,",
    "the observed rates are not compelling evidence of new physics , but leave the possibility open . as a natural solution to the hierarchy problem , models with supersymmetry ( susy ) are one of the preferred new physics scenarios , which also have the ability to alter this coupling from the corresponding sm value .",
    "susy models also have several problems .",
    "for instance , models with general soft breaking terms pose issues in the flavor sector .",
    "moreover , in minimal scenarios even generating the observed higgs mass is not an easy task . within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the higgs boson mass is bounded at tree level by the mass of the @xmath8 boson ( @xmath9 91 gev ) . to raise this value to the observed 125.5 gev ,",
    "large quantum corrections are needed .",
    "such large corrections can only come from top / stop loops and require either a large average mass of the stops or large stop mixing  @xcite .",
    "large masses and/or mixings can lead to more fine tuning , introducing the so called little hierarchy problem .",
    "this problem can be relaxed significantly at the cost of giving up on minimality , e.g.  introducing extra particles that modify the tree - level prediction for the higgs mass , allowing for naturally larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "this kind of extensions would be of special interest if the new particles could also help to modify the mssm rate of higgs to diphoton decays .",
    "one such class of models introduces an additional zero hypercharge ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 triplet , chiral superfield to the mssm  @xcite .",
    "this extra triplet is coupled to the higgs fields , which has the effect of helping to raise the mass of the higgs without the necessity of large stop masses or mixings . as an @xmath12 triplet with no hypercharge",
    ", the field contains singly electrically charged states . due to the coupling with the higgs",
    ", these additional charged states help to modify the mssm rate of higgs to diphoton decays .",
    "the additional triplet states couple with the higgs , but not directly to quarks or gluons , so the production cross section for the triplet states at the lhc will be negligible . the presence of these extra states will only be inferred through their indirect effects on other processes ( such as the @xmath13 ratio ) . another way these extra states",
    "may be inferred is in stop decays , which will be the main focus of this paper .",
    "many different direct searches for supersymmetry , including searches for sfermions and gluinos , are being undertaken at the lhc  @xcite . in many of these searches",
    "a simplified model is used in which the stops decay either only to a top quark and a neutralino or only to a bottom quark and a chargino . this assumption is not always representative of the mssm , but it allows for a search method .",
    "the addition of the triplet field introduces an extra chargino and neutralino . despite the stop not having direct couplings to the triplet states",
    ", its decays can be modified due to mixing between the fermionic triplets and the higgsinos . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how this effect can introduce significant changes in the branching ratios of the stops , compared to the mssm ones .",
    "these changes , of course , complicate the interpretation of direct searches analyses for stop pair production , as well as gluino pair production which cascades through stops .",
    "the content of this paper goes as follows . in section  [ section_themodel ]",
    "we will describe the setup of the model , including some considerations of the electroweak constraints on scalar triplets , as well as the parameters we will be using throughout this work . in section  [ section_stopdecays ]",
    "we examine the decays of the lightest stop in the triplet extension , and show how the branching ratios are affected by the fermion triplets , comparing the results with the mssm branching ratios . in section  [ sec_lhc ] , we do a quick lhc simulation and detector level analysis to exemplify how these changes can affect the direct searches of stop pairs .",

    "in fact , the area of parameter space that we have worked in does not allow for a 125.5 gev higgs in the mssm , but it is allowed with the addition of the triplet chiral superfield .",

    "from the point of view of susy searches at the lhc , and in particular in stop pair production , the phenomenology can also be quite different , even if the triplet can not couple directly to the stops .",
    "we have shown that fermion triplet states can introduce significant changes in the landscape of the stop decays via mixing in the neutralino / chargino sectors .",
    "these changes depend on the stop spectrum and in many cases can be as large as to modify the dominant decay modes of the lightest stop .",
