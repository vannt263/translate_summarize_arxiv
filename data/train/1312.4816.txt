    "as we see in table  [ tab : chiral ] ,  the orbital angular momentum fractions @xmath166 for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks in the ci have different signs and they add up to zero ,  i.e.  @xmath167 .",
    "this is the same pattern seen with dynamical fermions configurations with light quarks  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath166 for the @xmath168 and @xmath15 quarks in the di is due to the fact that @xmath164 in the di is large and negative ,  i.e.  @xmath169 for each of the three flavors .  all together",
    ",  the quark orbital angular momentum constitutes a fraction of @xmath13 of the nucleon spin .",
    "the majority of it comes from the di .",
    "the quark spin fraction of the nucleon spin is @xmath12 and glue angular momentum contributes a fraction of @xmath170 .",
    "we show all the different contributions to the momentum ,  angular momenta and orbital angular momenta in figs .",
    "[ fig : pie_diag_first_mom ] ,  [ fig : pie_diag_am ] and [ fig : pie_diag_orb_am ] .",
    "the left panels show the combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 contributions from ci and di separately while the right panels show the contributions from the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks ( with both ci and di combined together ) .",
    "we note from table  [ tab : chiral ] that the orbital angular momenta contribution from each quark flavor is strongly dependent on the corresponding quark spin ,  particularly in the case of di .",
    "as opposed to earlier calculations  @xcite ,  the recent lattice calculations with light dynamical fermions  @xcite have obtained smaller quark spin contributions from di .",
    "however ,  preliminary study  @xcite of the anomalous ward identity with light valence overlap fermion on @xmath171-flavor dynamical domain wall fermion sea configurations suggests that the di contributions are not small , though this study has larger error bars .",
    "more detailed dynamical fermion calculations with controlled statistical and systematic errors are needed to settle this issue .",
    "we should point out that a small @xmath172 from the di does not explain the small quark spin @xmath173 from the global fitting of dis  @xcite , in view of the fact that most of the lattice calculation of @xmath174 is @xmath175 which is much larger than @xmath176 .",
    "on the other hand ,  one could imagine that @xmath174 may turn out to be smaller than @xmath177 when the quark mass is close to the physical one in future lattice calculations ,  such as in  @xcite where @xmath174 is found to be much smaller than @xmath177 when the chiral extrapolation of the lattice results is carried out .",
    "however ,   this will not explain the octet @xmath178 .",
    "when both the ci and di are small ,  the calculated @xmath179 will be smaller than the experimental value of @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "thus ,  it is difficult to explain simultaneously @xmath164 and @xmath179 with a small @xmath181 in di .  to clarify this issue ,",
    "a full qcd simulation for @xmath164 and @xmath179 ( both ci and di ) around the physical point by taking into account the @xmath182 breaking effect is necessary .    in the constituent quark model ,",
    "the proton spin comes entirely from the quark spin .  on the other hand ,  in the skyrmion ,",
    "the total proton spin is from the collective rotational motion of the pion field  @xcite .",
    "what we find in the present calculation seems to suggest that the qcd picture ,  aside from the glue contribution ,  is somewhere in between these two models .  following wilson s renormalization group approach to effective theories ,",
    "it is suggested  @xcite that the effective theory for baryons between the scale of @xmath183 and @xmath184 mev may be a chiral quark model with renormalized couplings and renormalized meson ,  quark and gluon fields which preserve chiral symmetry .",
    "models like the little bag model with skyrmion outside the mit bag  @xcite ,  the cloudy bag model  @xcite and quark chiral soliton model  @xcite could possibly delineate the pattern of division among the components of the proton spin with large quark orbital angular momentum contribution .",
    "in summary ,  we have carried out a complete calculation of the quark and glue momentum and angular momentum in the nucleon for the first time on a quenched @xmath1 lattice with three quark masses .",
    "the calculation includes both the connected insertion ( ci ) and disconnected insertion ( di ) of the three - point functions for the quark energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we have used complex @xmath126 noise to estimate the quark loops in the di and the gauge field tensor from the overlap operator in the glue energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we find that reasonable signals can be obtained for the glue operator constructed from the overlap dirac operator .",
    "after chiral extrapolation ,  the momentum and angular momentum sum rules are used to normalize the quark and glue momentum and angular momentum fractions on the lattice .",
    "the renormalization and mixing of the quark and glue energy - momentum operators are obtained through one - loop perturbation ,  and the final results are reported in the @xmath25 scheme at @xmath26  gev .",
    "the renormalized momentum fractions for the quarks are @xmath185 for the ci and @xmath186 for the di .",
    "the glue momentum fraction is @xmath187 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the vanishing anomalous gravitomagnetic moment ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_2_sum ] ) ) is a consequence of momentum and angular momentum conservation .    after subtracting the quark spin ( @xmath164 ) from a previous calculation on the same lattice  @xcite from the angular momentum @xmath165",
    ",  we obtain the orbital angular fraction @xmath166 .  in the ci",
    ",  we find that the @xmath7 quark contribution is negative ,  while the @xmath8 quark contribution is positive .",
    "the sum is @xmath167 which is small .",
    "this behavior is the same as observed in dynamical calculation with light quarks  @xcite .",
    "the majority of the quark orbital angular momentum turns out to come from the di ,  because the quark spin from the di is large and negative for each of the three flavors .  in the end",
    ",  we find the quark orbital angular momentum ,  the quark spin ,  and glue angular momentum fractions of the nucleon spin are @xmath188 and @xmath170 ,  respectively .",
    "finally ,  this work should be extended to dynamical fermion calculations with light quarks and continuum and large volume limits to control the systematic errors of lattice qcd .",
    "we are in the process of carrying out the same calculation with the valence overlap fermion on @xmath171-flavor dynamical domain wall fermion sea configurations to remove the systematic errors due to the quenched approximation .",

    "<S> we report a complete calculation of the quark and glue momenta and angular momenta in the proton .  these include the quark contributions from both the connected and disconnected insertions .  </S>",
    "<S> the quark disconnected insertion loops are computed with @xmath0 noise ,  and the signal - to - noise is improved with unbiased subtractions .  </S>",
    "<S> the glue operator is comprised of gauge - field tensors constructed from the overlap operator .  </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is carried out on a @xmath1 quenched lattice at @xmath2 for wilson fermions with @xmath3 ,  and @xmath4 which correspond to pion masses at @xmath5 ,  and @xmath6  mev ,   respectively .  </S>",
    "<S> the chirally extrapolated @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark momentum / angular momentum fraction is found to be @xmath9 ,  the strange momentum / angular momentum fraction is @xmath10 ,  and that of the glue is @xmath11 .  the previous study of quark spin on the same lattice revealed that it carries a fraction of @xmath12 of proton spin .   </S>",
    "<S> the orbital angular momenta of the quarks are then obtained from subtracting the spin from their corresponding angular momentum components .  </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quark orbital angular momentum constitutes @xmath13 of the proton spin with almost all of it coming from the disconnected insertions . </S>"
