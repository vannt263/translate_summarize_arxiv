    "while the ps97 profile has a well known 2d sky projected form - the sersic @xcite profile , there has been no such analytical counterpart for the einasto profile .    in this paper",

    "the sersic @xcite profile , which has been used to describe the projected surface brightness profiles of galaxies , is similar in form to the einasto profile in 3d and is given by : @xmath24 = -q[(\\frac{r}{r_e})^{\\frac{1}{m } } -1 ]    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 where , @xmath28 is the projected distance in the plane of the sky , @xmath29 is the line of sight projected surface brightness at a projected scale radius @xmath30 , which can be defined to be the half - light radius of a sersic profile under the condition : @xmath31 ( ps97 ) with @xmath32 ( or @xmath33@xmath26@xmath34 ) characterizing the shape of the sersic profile .",

    "how well a projected einasto profile is described by a sersic profile , we numerically project and find that a sersic profile produces acceptable fits only in a limited range of the projected radius @xmath28 .",
    "we shall show in  3 that this range also depends on whether one fits the numerically projected einasto profile in linear scale ( large errors with increasing r ) or log scale ( large errors with decreasing r ) of density .",

    "@xcite have shown that within the limited radial range of @xmath72 and shape parameter @xmath73 , a deprojected sersic profile also fits the 3d distributions almost as well as the einasto profile , and a sersic profile fits the non - parametrically estimated 2d surface densities of dark matter haloes with acceptable errors ( @xmath74 per cent ) .    in the following discussion , we argue that if a 3d distribution is einasto - like , the 2d distribution need not be sersic - like and provide an analytically motivated functional form for the 2d projection , which can be used to describe the surface mass density of the einasto family of dark matter haloes subscribing to a wide range of the shape parameter ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) and over a wide radial ( projected ) range @xmath77 @xmath8 .      in terms of the line of sight distance ( @xmath41 ) , the surface mass density @xmath78(r ) can be estimated from : @xmath79 while an exact analytical expression for the integral in for the einasto profile has so far eluded us , we derive below an excellent semi - analytical approximation .    to intuitively motivate the functional form of @xmath80 for the einasto profile ,",

    "we have observed that fits with a sersic function ( @xmath62 ) to a numerically projected einasto profile ( @xmath64 ) are sensitive to whether one fits using linear density @xmath62 ( errors increasing for large r ) or log density @xmath235 ( errors increasing for small r ) yielding widely varying results .",

    "finally , we note that the form similarity of and , i.e. fitting functions that describe the 3d mass density of dark matter haloes and the 2d light distributions of galaxies , respectively , could be largely coincidental and should be used with caution when drawing conclusions about the similarity of dynamical evolution that lead to the formation of the stellar components of ellipticals and dark matter haloes .",
