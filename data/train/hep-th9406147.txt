    "throughout the development of modern nonlinear dynamics the investigation of lattices has played a significant role .",
    "often the motivation for such studies is that molecular crystals are lattices , and in these applications quantum effects can not be ignored .",
    "typical experiments  such as infra - red absorption , raman scattering , and neutron diffraction ",
    "deal with line spectra , where every line corresponds to a pair of quantum states , each with a particular number of quanta . at larger quantum numbers  approaching the correspondence limit ",
    "one is often interested in knowing how quantum corrections alter the results of classical calculations .",
    "our aim in this paper is to present some results of an exact theory of lattice solitons in the quantum regime . to this end",
    "we consider the following specific models , which are defined on one - dimensional lattices of @xmath0 freedoms ( or lattice sites ) with periodic boundary conditions and with @xmath10 being the ratio of anharmonicity to nearest neighbor hopping energy .",

    "the ablowitz - ladik equation is of interest because the corresponding classical system is integrable via the inverse scattering method @xcite and the quantum system is a simple example of a @xmath16-boson model @xcite .",

    "the reduced hamiltonian operator is @xmath21,\\label{h3}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are standard fermion raising and lowering operators satisfying the anticommutation relations @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "these systems are chosen to exhibit three different types of fundamental quanta : i ) standard bosons , ii ) @xmath16-deformed bosons , and iii ) standard fermions .",
    "a classical analog ( or correspondence limit ) exists only in the first two examples .",
    "since each of these three models is assumed to satisfy periodic boundary conditions , the hamiltonians are invariant under the action of the translation operator with eigenvalue @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the crystal momentum . for a fixed number of quanta @xmath28",
    "the energy eigenstates for a particular value of @xmath27 are separated into bands , and the band of lowest energy is of the form @xcite @xmath29 which is of particular interest for two reasons :    * within this band there is but a single eigenstate for each value of @xmath27 . * the @xmath6 quanta of the eigenfunctions for the band are located more closely together than in the bands of higher energy .",
    "we call this lowest band the _ soliton band _ and use equation ( [ a5 ] ) to compute the binding energy , effective mass , and maximum group velocity of the corresponding quantum soliton .    in the following section we sketch our procedure for computing @xmath30 as a function of the ratio of anharmonicity to nearest neighbor hopping energy ( @xmath10 ) , and in section 3 we give complete descriptions of the bands of our three models for the second quantum level ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "asymptotic expressions for @xmath30 at small and large values of @xmath10 are derived in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we use these results to construct wave packets  over @xmath6 and @xmath27of pure eigenstates that correspond to classical solitons , and some conclusions are presented in section 6 . throughout the discussion",
    "we assume units of energy and time for which @xmath32 .",
    "we have chosen to call our method of analysis the number state method , to distinguish it from the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of each of these two methods is discussed at some length in @xcite . in all cases where",
    "both techniques have been used they give ( as expected ) the same results .",
    "however it is important to note that the first model we consider ( qdnls ) is nonintegrable and can not be analysed by the qism .",
    "in our study of these three quantum lattices we take advantage of the fact that each hamiltonian operator commutes with a number operator @xmath33 , which counts the number of fundamental quanta ( bosons , @xmath16-deformed bosons , or fermions ) associated with each degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "thus a general eigenfunction of @xmath33 can be written in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of different ways that @xmath6 quanta can be arranged on @xmath0 freedoms , @xmath36 is the number state corresponding to a particular arrangement , and the @xmath37 are a set of @xmath38 arbitrary complex constants .",
    "for example if we are placing two bosons @xmath1 on two freedoms @xmath39 , there are three possible number states @xmath40 :    @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , which for typographical convenience we write as [ 20 ] , [ 11 ] , and [ 02 ] . requiring @xmath44 to satisfy the time independent schrdinger equation @xmath45 generates a @xmath46 matrix equation for the @xmath37 s , which determines the energy eigenvalues , and the eigenvectors  upon substitution into equation ( [ b1])yield the corresponding stationary state wave functions .",
    "we refer to this technique as the `` number state method '' ( nsm ) to differentiate it from the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) over which it has some theoretical and computational advantages @xcite .",
    "in effect the nsm diagonalizes the infinite hamiltonian matrix into finite blocks of size @xmath38 .",
    "for the bosons of @xmath47 and the q - deformed bosons of @xmath48 @xmath49 only one of the fermions of @xmath50 can be placed on a single freedom so in this case @xmath51 a moment s reflection will convince the reader that @xmath38 can easily become inconveniently large , but this is not a problem particular to the number state method .",
    "exact quantum wave functions on lattices are complicated objects , and the same difficulty appears with the qism @xcite .",
    "each of our three systems has translational symmetry so these @xmath52 blocks can be further diagonalized into smaller blocks with fixed values of crystal momentum @xmath27 , where @xmath53 is an eigenvalue of the translation operator @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is defined by the property @xmath56 so that @xmath57 = [ n_f n_1\\ldots n_{f-1}]$ ] .",
    "in this manner we find @xmath58 for every allowed momentum state with a minimum of computational effort .    as a simple example of this method , consider the first quantum level @xmath59 .",
    "the energy bands for all three models are identical because there are just @xmath0 ways that a single quantum can be placed on @xmath0 freedoms .",
    "thus we find @xmath60\\ , , \\label{ps1}\\ ] ] and @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath0 even and @xmath64 for @xmath0 odd .    since the effective mass @xmath3 is defined as @xmath65 we have @xmath66",
