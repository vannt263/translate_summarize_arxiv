    "recently , large sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect surveys from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , and _",
    "planck _ have delivered catalogs with hundreds of massive galaxy clusters @xcite . in the case of act and spt , which operate from the ground with modest frequency coverage near 150  ghz and arcminute resolution",
    ", unresolved galaxies present a potential systematic uncertainty in characterizing ( or even detecting ) galaxy clusters via the sz effect @xcite . both instruments",
    "have accurately measured the blank sky population of bright radio sources @xcite and the anisotropy power spectrum from both radio and dusty submillimeter sources @xcite .",
    "however , there are few observational constraints on the 150  ghz emission from member galaxies in massive clusters , even though clusters are known to host a significant number of radio galaxies . for example , within 0.5  arcmin of the cluster center there are @xmath0 times more radio sources compared to blank sky and from 0.5 to @xmath4  arcmin of the cluster center there are @xmath5 times more radio sources compared to blank sky @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the study of extragalactic radio sources at mm wavelengths is relatively immature , and it is therefore non - trivial to properly account for these radio sources in 150  ghz sz data .",
    "even worse , the bulk of the 150  ghz observational data is limited to very bright flat - spectrum sources and is not particularly relevant to the dimmer steep - spectrum sources typical of central cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the low frequency properties of radio sources are well understood .",
    "first , radio sources are generally grouped into two families : flat - spectrum and steep - spectrum .",
    "steep spectrum sources have a @xmath6  ghz spectral index of @xmath7 and flat spectrum sources have a @xmath6  ghz spectral index of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 describes a source spectrum of the form @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "physically , a flat spectrum is typically due to synchrotron self - absorption ( i.e. , the medium is optically thick ) , which usually means the jet is oriented towards the viewer . in contrast , when the jet is orthogonal to the viewing angle , the optically thin lobes are visible , which tend to have a steep spectrum @xcite .",
    "for both families of radio sources , the spectral index tends to decrease at higher frequencies due to electron aging ( relativistic energy loss ) and/or the medium becoming less optically thick at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "this steepening has been observed in both flat spectrum sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) and steep spectrum sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although some measurements do not find such steepening ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , steep spectrum sources are generally associated with powerful elliptical and s0 galaxies ( i.e. , the bcg of a massive cluster ) , and nearly all of the radio sources associated with clusters have a steep spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , steep spectrum sources tend to have little or no temporal variability @xcite .",
    "this wealth of knowledge has been exploited in a range of calculations and simulations to estimate the amount of radio contamination in 150  ghz sz measurements @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that radio contamination in massive clusters at 150  ghz should be relatively minor , but they have not yet been systematically verified via observational data .",
    "during the period from 2006 to 2012 we observed a set of 45 massive galaxy clusters using bolocam at the caltech submillimeter observatory @xcite .",
    "these clusters have a median mass of m@xmath11  m@xmath12 and masses as low as m@xmath13  m@xmath12 , which is similar to the spt and act mass limits @xcite .",
    "is the mass enclosed within a sphere with an average density of 500 times the background density . ]",
    "all of the masses were computed using _",
    "chandra _ x - ray data according to the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the median redshift of our sample is @xmath14 , and the median sz s / n is 12 .",
    "a complete description of these observations and data are given elsewhere @xcite , and we briefly summarize the relevant details below .",
    "for all of these observations , bolocam was configured to operate at 140  ghz ,  ghz for the radio sources with @xmath15 ) .",
    "this difference in effective band center produces less than a 1% change in the extrapolated flux density from 30  ghz , and is therefore not included in our analysis .",
    "furthermore , we note that our data are calibrated against objects with approximately thermal spectrum , and both the source spectrum and the bolocam spectral response were fully accounted for in the calibration @xcite . ] with a 58  arcsec full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "all of the cluster images are @xmath16  arcmin squares centered on the cluster .",
    "the centers of the images generally have noise rmss of @xmath17  mjy / beam , ( @xmath18  @xmath19k@xmath20-arcmin ) increasing to approximately twice that value at the lower coverage edges of the images .",
    "this depth is similar to the spt and act survey depths  @xcite .    in order to subtract atmospheric fluctuations from these data ,",
    "we remove the time - instantaneous average signal over the field of view and then high pass filter the datastreams at a characteristic frequency of 250  mhz .",
    "this process also removes some astronomical signal from the data , and we quantify this via simulation to obtain a signal transfer function .",
    "for the results presented in this manuscript , the cluster signal transfer function was computed as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we did not explicitly compute transfer functions for the point sources .",
    "instead , we processed point source models centered on the galaxy positions determined from low frequency data through our reduction pipeline and then directly fit the resulting filtered image to our data . in all cases",
    "the point source models were normalized to an amplitude of 1  mjy .",
    "we note that the effective filtering of the point source model is independent of the amplitude of the model for sources @xmath21  jy , which is at least 3 orders of magnitude brighter than any of the radio sources in our sample .",
    "most of our radio source flux densities at @xmath0  ghz were obtained from previously published results from the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) , the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array , and the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) @xcite .",
    "however , we reduced data collected by these facilities for an additional 13 radio sources ( 3 from ovro / bima and 10 from sza ) .",
    "our reduction of these previously unpublished data followed the methods described in e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to those manuscripts for additional details . to obtain point source flux densities we simultaneously fit for the cluster sz signal and all of the point sources .",
    "we modeled the cluster sz emission using the best - fit generalized navarro , frenk , and white ( gnfw ) pressure profiles from @xcite , which are described by @xmath22^{(\\mathcal{\\beta }        -\\mathcal{\\gamma})/\\mathcal{\\alpha}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the pressure , @xmath24 is the pressure normalization , @xmath25 is the radial coordinate , @xmath26 is the concentration parameter , and @xmath9 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 describe the power - law slopes at moderate , large , and small radii .",
    "corrections for the sza primary beam were accounted for in both the cluster and point source fits .",
    "there are a significant number of bright radio galaxies near the centers of massive clusters ( e.g. , @xcite find that @xmath29% of radio sources within 0.5  arcmin of the cluster center are cluster members ) .",
    "unfortunately , these sources are difficult to detect in our arcmin - resolution sz data due to the large degeneracy between the inner slope of the sz profile and the radio source flux density .",
    "consequently , we have searched the 1.4  ghz nvss catalog within 1  arcmin of each cluster center @xcite in order to select probable cluster member galaxies .",
    "we chose the nvss survey for our galaxy selection because it has approximately uniform depth over the full sky above dec @xmath30 , and is complete above a flux density of 2.5  mjy . throughout this paper",
    "we refer to the nvss selected sources within 1  arcmin as cluster member galaxies",
    ". however , based on the results of @xcite and the blank - sky source density of the nvss catalog , we expect @xmath31% of the sources to be field galaxies unassocated with the clusters .",
    "our search radius of 1  arcmin was chosen for two main reasons .",
    "first , the results of @xcite indicate that a 1  arcmin search radius is large enough to contain the bulk of the bright cluster member radio galaxies without including a significant number of foreground and background galaxies that are not associated with the cluster ( see figure  [ fig : number ] ) .",
    "second , by chosing a search radius approximately equal to our beam fwhm we include all of the galaxies that wo nt be resolved separately from the cluster sz peak .",
    "our choice of a fixed angular search radius means that the search radius in physical distance ( e.g. kpc ) varies significantly over our sample , which could produce biases in our galaxy selection . however , given that the number of nvss sources falls dramatically beyond @xmath32  arcsec in radius , it is unlikely that a significant number of bright cluster member galaxies will fall outside of our search radius .",
    "furthermore , as justified above , our search radius is small enough such that the contamination from non - cluster - galaxies is expected to be small .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any significant biases in our galaxy selection due to our choice of search radius .    over our sample of 45 clusters",
    ", we find 31 nvss sources spread between 26 clusters ( three clusters contain two sources and one cluster contains three sources , see table  [ tab : radio_1 ] ) . in agreement with previous results ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "most of our cool - core clusters have at least one compact nvss source ( 15/17 ) , while less than half of the disturbed clusters in our sample have a compact nvss source ( 6/16 ) .",
    "note that our classification of clusters as cool - core or disturbed is based on x - ray measurements and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the projected luminosity ratio ( @xmath33 ) is used to define cool - core systems @xcite , with clusters having l@xmath34 classified as cool - cores .",
    "the centroid shift parameter ( w@xmath35 ) , which measures the difference between the x - ray peak and the x - ray centroid as a function of radius , is used to define disturbed systems @xcite , with clusters having w@xmath36 classified as disturbed .",
    "we note that two systems are both cool - core and disturbed , so the number of non - cool - core disturbed systems with compact nvss sources is 4/14 .",

    "first , we jointly fit a point source template centered on the nvss coordinates , along with a template for the sz emission , to our data .",
    "our fitting procedure is described in detail in @xcite , and we refer the reader to that manuscript for additional details .",
    "the normalization of the point - source template gives the flux density of the source ( in mjy ) .",
    "for the sz template , we used the morphology - dependent best - fit gnfw pressure profiles from @xcite ( e.g. , we used the best - fit cool - core template for the cool - core clusters in our sample ) , allowing the normalization of the template ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) to be a free parameter .",
    "these profiles were used because all of the point sources we fit are in the central regions of the cluster , where the shape of the pressure profiles varies significantly with morphological type .",
    "we then inserted the best - fit sz and point - source templates into 100 noise realizations and repeated the fit in order to characterize our uncertainty on the point - source flux density . for most of our data",
    "the raw point - source sensitivity is @xmath6  mjy , but our uncertainties on the flux densities of these point sources are @xmath222  mjy , with the degradation due to degeneracies between the sz and point source templates .",
    "the sensitivity degradation depends strongly on the separation of the sz and point - source centroids , along with the angular size of the sz template . for clusters with multiple radio sources , we fit for each source separately .",
    "the best - fit flux densities are given in table  [ tab : radio_1b ] .",
    "we then derived an independent estimate for the 140  ghz flux densities of the sources by extrapolating the low frequency data .",
    "we have primarily combined 1.4  ghz nvss data with @xmath0  ghz measurements from sza and/or ovro / bima , which exist for 24/28 sources @xcite .",
    "three of the sources without 30  ghz data have measurements at either 4.85  ghz and/or frequencies below 1.4  ghz , which have been used to constrain the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of those sources @xcite .",
    "we fit an sed of the form @xmath223 , and we find all of the galaxies have @xmath224 ( see figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "our fits include both the measurement uncertainties and overall flux calibration uncertainties on the source flux densities , the latter of which is equalt to 3% for the nvss measurements , 4% for the ovro / bima measurements , and 5% for sza measurements",
    "we note that there are some systematic differences in calibration between the datasets ( e.g. , using pre- or post - wmap planetary models ) , but these differences are below the flux calibration uncertainties quoted for each dataset .",
    "furthermore , for our sed fits we assume a single observing frequency for each dataset independent of source spectrum .",
    "this results in a negligible bias in our results due to the small fractional bandwidths and large separations in band centers among our datasets ( 1.4 , 30 , and 140  ghz ) .",
    "although our source selection using 1.4  ghz data favors steep spectrum sources , we note that the @xmath0  ghz data do not contain any point source detections without an nvss counterpart .",
    "the @xmath0  ghz data are generally sensitive to sources with flux densities larger than @xmath225  mjy , and would therefore have detected bright flat spectrum sources if they exist in the central regions of these clusters .",
    "since all of the bright central radio sources are steep spectrum sources , which tend to have little or no temporal variability @xcite , the asynchronous nvss / sza / ovro / bima observations should provide an accurate characterization of the source sed .",

    "all of these galaxies are steep spectrum sources , and we find a median spectral index of @xmath228 .",
    "the spectral indices for the disturbed and cool - core sub - samples are also shown , and have been offset by 0.01 for ease of viewing .",
    "compared to the full sample , the galaxies associated with cool - core clusters have shallower spectral indices on average . ]",
    "none of the nvss sources near cluster centers are detected at a significant level in our 140  ghz images ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "consequently , we have characterized the average point - source signal measured in our data by comparing our measured flux density to the predicted flux density based on the extrapolation from lower frequency measurements . to avoid correlations and biases in this average measurement ,",
    "we have discarded the data from clusters with multiple nvss sources , those with no 30  ghz data , and also abell 2261 due to the fact that the sz template does not provide a good description of those data .",
    "for the 17 remaining clusters we formed the quantity @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the best - fit flux density in our bolocam image , @xmath232 is the extrapolated flux density based on the lower frequency measurements assuming a constant spectral index , @xmath233 is the uncertainty on the bolocam measurement , and @xmath234 is the uncertainty on the extrapolated flux density .",
    "if our extrapolation of the spectral index found at lower frequencies perfectly describes our data then the values of @xmath235 will have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 .",
    "we find a mean @xmath236 , which indicates that our data show no statistically significant evidence for a change in the spectral index above 30  ghz , although our data are consistent with a slight steepening of the spectral index ( a steepening is consistent with previous results and theoretical expectations @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that a one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov goodness of fit test shows that our values of @xmath235 are consistent with a gaussian distribution with a probability to exceed of 0.60 . in addition , we directly computed the standard deviation of the 17 values of @xmath235 , and we find that this standard deviation is @xmath237 .",

    "analogous to the quantity @xmath235 , we formed the quantity @xmath269 we find a mean @xmath270 , indicating that our 140  ghz data do not show statistically significant evidence for the presence of these radio sources .",
    "however , if we focus solely on the brightest sources with @xmath271  mjy , then we find a mean @xmath272 , showing a detection of these sources at modest statistical significance ( @xmath273 ) .",
    "this implies that our non - detection of the ensemble - average of all radio sources is likely due to the fact that most of the sources are well below the bolocam noise rms , which means that averaging over these sources adds a significant amount of noise but very little signal . for completeness",
    ", we note that the mean value of @xmath235 for these brightest sources is @xmath274 , which is also consistent with no change in the spectral index between 30  ghz and 140  ghz .",
    "since the extrapolation of the radio galaxy flux densities from lower frequencies provides a good description of our 140  ghz data , we subtracted each of the radio galaxies using the extrapolated flux density .",
    "a complete list of the subtracted radio sources is given in table  [ tab : radio_2 ] .",
    "in most cases the measurement uncertainty on the extrapolated flux density is quite small , and our overall uncertainty is therefore dominated by the 30% intrinsic scatter in the extrapolation .",
    "we then computed the peak sz s / n for each cluster both with and without the radio source(s ) subtracted using the optimal filtering formalism described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we construct an sz template of the form @xmath275 , weight this template by the signal transfer function of our map and the inverse of the map variance , convolve our map with the resulting filter , and search for the peak s / n .",
    "this is repeated for @xmath276 , and the maximum peak s / n over all filter scales is used to describe the sz s / n .",
    "this is essentially the same algorithm used by both act and spt to search for clusters in their survey data @xcite .",
    "we find the maximum fractional change in sz s / n for any of the clusters is @xmath1% , and only 13/45 of the clusters show a fractional change in sz s / n larger than 1% ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "consequently , for the high - mass and moderate - redshift clusters in our sample contamination from radio emission is in general small compared to the noise in our data .",
    "furthermore , for the brightest radio galaxies we generally find that the value of @xmath277 with the maximum sz s / n is smaller when the radio source is subtracted from the map , which is due to the resulting cluster profile being more sharply peaked ( recall that these radio sources partially fill in the sz decrement at 140  ghz ) .",
    "although the overall level of radio contamination in our sample is small , we note that 11/12 of the brightest radio sources are associated with cool - core systems , and therefore 11/17 cool - core systems show a fractional change in sz s / n larger than 1% . )",
    "is slightly lower than the median redshift of the full sample ( @xmath14 ) and the median redshift of the disturbed systems ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "consequently , some of the difference in radio contamination for the different morphological classifications may be due to these differences in redshift rather than the cluster environment . ]",
    "previous studies have found a similar relationship between strong radio emission and cool - core systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . further supporting this trend of cool - core systems hosting the brightest radio galaxies",
    ", we also find a correlation between the strength of the radio emission and the projected x - ray luminosity ratio , which we have used to separate cool - core and non - cool - core systems ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "this correlation is quantified by a spearman rank coefficient of 0.46 and null hypothesis probability of 0.02 ( for 25 data points ) .",
    "in addition , we find that there is no significant correlation between the fractional change in sz s / n and cluster mass for our sample , quantified by a spearman rank coefficient of -0.11 and a null hypothesis probability of 0.59 ( again for 25 data points , see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "consequently , the fractional change in sz s / n due to radio contamination is approximately independent of mass for these high mass systems .",
    "since there is no evidence for a correlation between cluster mass and fractional change in sz s / n , and since our sample approximately spans the mass range of objects discovered by the act and spt surveys @xcite , the amount of radio contamination in those surveys should be similar to what we have found for our sample .",
    "however , we caution that those surveys contain a significantly larger fraction of low - mass clusters , and the negative spearman rank coefficient indicates that our data favor an on - average increase in fractional change in sz s / n with decreasing cluster mass ( although at low significance given the 59% probability of our data being consistent with no trend in mass ) .    due to the way we have selected the cluster - member radio sources , anything below the nvss detection limit ( 2.5 mjy at 1.4 ghz )",
    "will not be included in our analysis .",
    "however , even if we assume the smallest magnitude spectral index found for any of the radio galaxies in our sample ( @xmath279 ) , a source undetected by nvss would have a maximum 140  ghz flux density of @xmath280  mjy .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that a source undetected by nvss would have more than a 1% effect on the optimally filtered peak sz signal we measure for any of the clusters in the bolocam sample .",
    "we do note that , of the 21 central radio sources detected by @xcite , there were two sources with spectral indices smaller in magnitude than @xmath281 , and one source with a spectral index of @xmath282 . since our @xmath0  ghz data are most sensitive to these flat spectrum sources , we consider the the extreme case of a source with @xmath282 and a @xmath0  ghz flux density just below our detection limit of @xmath283  mjy .",
    "such a source could go undetected in our @xmath0  ghz data and still have a 140  ghz flux density of @xmath284  mjy .",
    "such a source would likely produce a @xmath6% change in the sz s / n measured by bolocam ( see figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "however , given the rarity of such flat spectrum sources in the centers of clusters , coupled with the fact that the source would also need to be close to our detection threshold , it is unlikely that there are a significant number of such sources in the bolocam cluster sample .",
    "although the number of cluster radio galaxies drops quickly with radius , there are likely to be some cluster member radio galaxies outside of our 1  arcmin diameter search radius . for example",
    ", the total number of radio sources in the central @xmath4  arcmin radius of our images is enhanced by a factor of @xmath5 compared to the blank - sky average @xcite .",
    "however , there are significantly fewer sources in these regions compared to the cluster centers ( a factor of @xmath32 ) , and the contamination from these sources will be much less degenerate with the cluster sz signal due to the relatively large spatial separation .",
    "therefore , we expect the contamination from these sources to be significantly smaller than the contamination from the central radio galaxies . consequently , we examine the effects of these sources in a statistical sense .    first , the factor of 3 increase in the number of radio sources will increase the corresponding noise fluctuations from undetected sources by a factor of @xmath285",
    ". however , even with this enhancement the noise fluctuations from radio sources will still be sub - dominant to the noise fluctuations from dusty star - forming galaxies and negligible compared to the noise rms in our images ( @xmath286  mjy compared to @xmath6  mjy ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that the increased number of radio sources in the direction of the cluster will systematically fill in the sz decrement , which is referenced to the average signal level outside of the cluster , and bias our results . based on a simple power - law extrapolation of the measured number counts at @xmath287  ghz , which constrain the number counts above @xmath32  mjy , we estimate that the sz decrement will be filled in by @xmath288  mjy / arcmin@xmath289 due to the higher than average number of radio sources towards the cluster @xcite .",
    "this surface brightness is almost 3 orders of magnitude below the average sz surface brightness towards the clusters in our sample and therefore should produce a @xmath290% bias in the average sz signal recovered .",
    "consequently , contamination from radio galaxies outside of 1  arcmin in radius from the cluster center should generally be negligible .",
    "in addition to radio emission , some of the cluster - member galaxies are likely to have thermal dust emission .",
    "studies of clusters out to @xmath291 in the mid - ir with _",
    "spitzer _ have shown that there can be significant enhancements in the number of 24 @xmath19m - detected sources within narrow redshift slices centered on clusters @xcite .",
    "however , the total number of 24 @xmath19 m objects detected towards clusters is @xmath292% above the number detected towards blank fields at similar sensitivities , due to the fact that the sources are detected over a wide range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "compared to 24  @xmath19 m observations , our data are significantly more sensitive to high - redshift galaxies and less sensitive to dust emission from cluster - member galaxies @xcite , and so the effective enhancement compared to a blank field will be even smaller in our bolocam images .",
    "furthermore , _ herschel _ has recently published results characterizing the dust emission from 68 cluster bcgs at frequencies as low as 600  ghz @xcite .",
    "15 of the bcgs are detected in one or more herschel bands , and grey - body fits of the _ herschel _ data result in extrapolated flux densities at our observing band of @xmath293  mjy for all but two of these sources . based on our analysis of the contamination from central radio galaxies ,",
    "even these brightest dusty sources would result in @xmath294% fractional changes in the sz s / n",
    ". in summary , the dust emission sourced by cluster - member galaxies in our images is likely to be negligible , and we therefore do not account for it in this analysis .",

    "fortunately , we are able to easily detect and subtract these sources from our data because they have little or no degeneracy with our template of the sz signal .",
    "we search for these sources by selecting pixel excursions with a s / n @xmath312 in maps that have had the best - fit sz template subtracted and are beam - smoothed for improved point source extraction .",
    "we find 15 such excursions , 12 with positive flux density and three with negative flux density .",
    "six of these positive flux candidates have counterparts in nvss , and we estimate the 140  ghz flux density of each of these sources by fitting a point source template to our maps using the nvss coordinates as a prior @xcite .",

    "although our detection threshold is not uniform due to residual sz contamination , the varying depths of our maps , and the tapered coverage within our maps , the spt source counts measured by @xcite indicate we should see @xmath4 sources above 10  mjy in our maps .",
    "therefore , we detect approximately three times as many bright radio sources as expected , although this excess is not significant due to the small number of sources .",
    "for the five clusters that contain these six radio sources we have computed the sz s / n both before and after subtraction of the source(s ) .",
    "note that in all cases we have removed the bright central radio sources described in table  [ tab : radio_2 ] .",
    "these six radio sources are located at a range of positions relative to the cluster centers ( between 2.5 and 6.6  arcmin ) , and have 140  ghz flux densities between 8.7 and 51.4  mjy . in most cases",
    "the sz s / n decreases after subtraction of the radio source(s ) , due to the fact that the radio source(s ) are mainly in the ring of positive flux surrounding the sz decrement caused by the high - pass filtering applied to the data . in the extreme case of abell 963 , with a 26.8  mjy radio source located only 2.5  arcmin from the cluster center ,",
    "the fractional change in the sz s / n is 12% .",
    "however , the median fractional change in sz s / n due to these bright sources is @xmath311% .",
    "if we therefore assume that a source brighter than 2.5 times below our detection threshold would be required to produce a @xmath313% fractional change in the sz s / n , then based on the results of @xcite we expect @xmath314 such sources among our sample of 45 clusters . therefore , given the results of section  [ sec : central ] , where 13 clusters had central radio galaxies that produced a @xmath313% change in the sz s / n , contamination from undetected back / foreground radio galaxies should be a factor of @xmath315 below the contamination from central cluster member radio galaxies .",
    "after removing the six sources with nvss associations , we are left with nine unassociated pixels ( six positive and three negative ) .",
    "all of these unassociated pixels have s / n just above four .",
    "statistically , based on gaussian noise , we only expect @xmath6 noise excursion with s / n larger than four , and it is unclear why we have nine such excursions .",
    "however , we do note that most of our images have significant sz signal in them ( s / n  @xmath316 ) , and relatively modest differences between our sz model and the underlying cluster profile could therefore combine with noise excursions in some clusters and cause such high s / n pixels in our best - fit - sz - model - subtracted images .",
    "in addition , the noise in our images is not perfectly white , and large - angular - scale noise could also be responsible for some of these",
    "s / n  @xmath312 pixels . given that our data show an excess of bright radio sources exclusive of these nine unassociated pixels , we assume that they are the result of one of the non - idealities mentioned above rather than an actual radio source . we do not attempt to further account for these nine unassociated pixels with s / n @xmath312 .",
    "using a combination of 140  ghz bolocam data , 1.4  ghz nvss data , and @xmath0  ghz data from ovro / bima and sza , we have studied the 140  ghz emission from cluster - member galaxies in a sample of 45 massive clusters . in agreement with previous results",

    "<S> we describe in detail our characterization of the compact radio source population in 140  ghz bolocam observations of a set of 45 massive galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of 1.4 and 30  ghz data to select a total of 28 probable cluster member radio galaxies and also to predict their 140  ghz flux densities . </S>",
    "<S> all of these galaxies are steep - spectrum radio sources and they are found preferentially in the cool - core clusters within our sample . in particular , 11 of the 12 brightest cluster member radio sources are associated with cool - core systems . </S>",
    "<S> although none of the individual galaxies are robustly detected in the bolocam data , the ensemble - average flux density at 140  ghz is consistent with , but slightly lower than , the extrapolation from lower frequencies assuming a constant spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our data indicate an intrinsic scatter of @xmath0% around the power - law extrapolated flux densities at 140  ghz , although our data do not tightly constrain this scatter . for our cluster sample , which is composed of high mass and moderate redshift systems , we find that the maximum fractional change in the sunyaev - zeldovich signal integrated over any single cluster due to the presence of these radio sources is @xmath1% , and only @xmath2 of the clusters show a fractional change of more than 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of contamination is strongly dependent on cluster morphology , and nearly all of the clusters with @xmath3% contamination are cool - core systems . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that radio contamination is not significant compared to current noise levels in 140  ghz images of massive clusters and is in good agreement with the level of radio contamination found in previous results based on lower frequency data or simulations . </S>"
