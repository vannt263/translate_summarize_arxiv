    "one of the main issues in modern electronics is that as devices get ever smaller the removal of waste energy generated by joule heating ( which is in turn caused by the scattering of the information carrying conduction electrons ) becomes problematic . a possible solution to this problem of excess heating is offered by spintronics  @xcite in nonitinerant materials .",
    "since charge transport is absent in such materials , the energy that is dissipated in the transport of a single information carrier ( a spin ) in a nonitinerant system  @xcite is much lower than in both itinerant electronic- and spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been theoretically shown that the energy required for a single logic operation is low in a spin based device .",
    "@xcite    clearly , energy considerations are not the only factor that play a role in the determination of the feasibility of spintronics in nonitinerant materials .",
    "other important criteria are the operating speed of potential devices , and the possibility of creation , control , and read out of the signals used in these systems . indeed , it has been proposed that spin - based devices in nonitinerant systems could operate at high frequencies .",
    "@xcite furthermore , there have been various proposals to create ( by means of spin pumping  @xcite and the spin seebeck effect  @xcite ) and read out ( by means of the inverse spin hall effect  @xcite ) these pure spin currents in nonitinerant systems .",

    "that is , a device that has a spin conductance that is zero for applied dc driving fields and increases with frequency for applied ac driving fields .",
    "traditional capacitors have a wide range of applications in electronics , most notably in frequency selection , noise reduction , and temporary energy storage .    the device that we propose consists of a spin chain with anisotropy @xmath4 in the exchange interaction in the @xmath5 direction .",
