    "it is known that spin operators satisfy neither fermi nor bose commutation relations .",
    "for example , the pauli matrices for @xmath3 operator commute on different sites and anticommute on the same site .",
    "the commutation relations for spins are determined by @xmath1 algebra , leading to the absence of a wick theorem for the generators . to avoid this difficulty and",
    "construct a diagrammatic technique and path integral representation for spin systems various approaches have been used . the first class of approaches is based on representation of spins as bilinear combination of fermi or bose operators @xcite-@xcite , whereas the representations belonging to the second class deal with more complex objects like , e.g. the hubbard @xcite and supersymmetric @xcite operators , the nonlinear sigma model @xcite etc .",
    "however , in all cases the fundamental problem which is at the heart of the difficulty is the local constraint problem . to illustrate it ,",
    "let s consider e.g. , first class of representations .",
    "introducing the auxiliary fermi or bose fields makes the dimensionality of the hilbert space , where these operators act , greater than the dimensionality of the hilbert space for the spin operators . as a result",
    ", the spurious unphysical states should be excluded from the consideration which leads in turn to some restrictions ( constraints ) on bilinear combinations of fermi / bose operators , resulting in substantial complication of corresponding rules of the diagrammatic technique .",
    "the representations from the second class suffer from the same kind of problem , transformed either into a high nonlinearity of resulting model ( non - linear sigma model ) or hierarchical structure of perturbation series in the absence of wick theorem ( hubbard operators ) .",
    "the exclusion of double occupied and empty states for a @xmath3 impurity interacting with conduction electron bath ( single impurity kondo model ) , is controlled by fictitious chemical potential ( lagrange multiplier ) of abrikosov pseudofermions @xcite . at the end of calculations this `` chemical potential '' @xmath4 should be put @xmath5 to `` freeze out '' all unphysical states . in other words",
    ", there exists an additional @xmath6 gauge field which freezes the charge fluctuations associated with this representation .",
    "the method works for dilute systems where all the spins can be considered independently .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to generalize this technique to the lattice of spins results in the replacement of the local constraint ( the number of particles on each site is fixed ) by the so - called global constraint where the number of particles is fixed only on an average for the whole crystal .",
    "there is no reason to believe that such an approximation is a good starting point for the description of the strongly correlated systems .",
    "another possibility to treat the local constraint rigorously is based on majorana fermion representation . in this case",
    "fermions are `` real '' and corresponding gauge symmetry is @xmath7 .",
    "the difficulty with this representation is mostly related to the physical regularization of the fluctuations associated with the discrete symmetry group .",
    "an alternative approach for spin hamiltonians , free from local constraint problem , has been proposed in the pioneering paper of popov and fedotov @xcite .",
    "based on the exact fermionic representation for @xmath3 and @xmath8 operators , where the constraint is controlled by purely imaginary lagrange multipliers , these authors demonstrated the power and simplification of the corresponding matsubara diagram technique .",
    "the semi - fermionic representation ( we discuss the meaning of this definition in the course of our paper ) used by popov and fedotov is neither fermionic , nor bosonic , but reflects the fundamental pauli nature of spins .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a brief introduction to a semi - fermionic ( sf ) approach .",
    "a reader can find many useful technical details , discussion of mathematical aspects of semi - fermionic representation and its application to various problems in the original papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , we reproduce the key steps of important derivations contained in @xcite,@xcite in order to make the reader s job easier .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section i , the general concept of semi - fermions is introduced .",
    "we begin with the construction of the sf formalism for the fully antisymmetric representation of @xmath0 group and the fully symmetric sf representation of @xmath1 group using the imaginary - time ( matsubara ) representation .",
    "we show a `` bridge '' between different representations using the simplest example of @xmath8 in @xmath1 and discuss the sf approach for @xmath2 group .",
    "finally , we show how to work with semi - fermions in real - time formalism and construct the schwinger - keldysh technique for sf . in this section",
    ", we will mostly follow original papers by the author @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the reader acquainted with semi - fermionic technique can easily skip this section . in section",
    "ii , we illustrate the applications of sf formalism for various problems of condensed matter physics , such as ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and resonance valence bond ( rvb ) instabilities in the heisenberg model , competition between local and non - local correlations in kondo lattices in the vicinity of magnetic and spin glass critical points and the kondo effect in quantum dots . in the epilogue , we discuss some open questions and perspectives .",
    "to begin with , we briefly reproduce the arguments contained in the original paper of popov and fedotov . let s assume first @xmath3 .",
    "we denote as @xmath9 the hamiltonian of spin system .",
    "the standard pauli matrices can be represented as bilinear combination of fermi operators as follows : @xmath10 on each site @xmath11 of the lattice .",
    "the partition function of the spin problem @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the operator obtained from @xmath15 by the replacement ( [ rep1 ] ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the number of sites in the system and @xmath18 is inverse temperature ) .",
    "to prove equation ( [ pf1 ] ) we note that the trace over the nonphysical states of the @xmath11-th site vanishes @xmath19 thus , the identity ( [ pf1 ] ) holds .",
    "the constraint of fixed number of fermions @xmath20 , is achieved by means of the purely imaginary lagrange multipliers @xmath21 playing the role of imaginary chemical potentials of fermions . as a result",
    ", the green s function @xmath22 is expressed in terms of matsubara frequencies @xmath23 corresponding neither fermi nor bose statistics .    for @xmath8",
    "we adopt the representation of @xmath15 in terms of the 3-component fermi field : @xmath24 the partition function @xmath12 is given by @xmath25 it is easy to note that the states with occupation numbers 0 and 3 cancel each other , whereas states with occupation 1 and 2 are equivalent due to the particle - hole symmetry and thus can be taken into account on an equal footing by proper normalization of the partition function . as a result , the green s function in the imaginary time representation is expressed in terms of @xmath26 frequencies .    in this section ,",
    "we show how semi - fermionic ( popov - fedotov ) representation can be derived using the mapping of partition function of the spin problem onto the corresponding partition function of the fermionic problem .",
    "the cases of arbitrary n ( even ) for su(n ) groups and arbitrary s for su(2 ) group are discussed .",
    "we begin with the derivation of sf representation for su(n ) group .",
    "the su(@xmath17 ) algebra is determined by the generators obeying the following commutation relations : @xmath27= \\delta_{ij}(\\delta^\\rho_\\alpha \\hat s^\\beta_{\\sigma i}-\\delta^\\beta_\\sigma \\hat s^\\rho_{\\alpha i}),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt the definition of the cartan algebra @xcite of the su(@xmath17 ) group @xmath29 similar to the one used in @xcite , noting that the diagonal generators @xmath30 are not traceless . to ensure a vanishing trace",
    ", the diagonal generators should only appear in combinations @xmath31 which effectively reduce the number of independent diagonal generators to @xmath32 and the total number of su(@xmath17 ) generators to @xmath33 .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the representations of su(n ) group determined by rectangular young tableau ( yt ) ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) and mostly concentrate on two important cases of the fully asymmetric ( one column ) yt and the fully symmetric ( one row ) yt .    the generator @xmath34 may be written as biquadratic form in terms of the fermi - operators @xmath35 where the `` color '' index @xmath36 and the @xmath37 constraints @xmath38 restrict the hilbert space to the states with @xmath39 particles and ensure the characteristic symmetry in the color index @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the number of rows in rectangular young tableau whereas @xmath42 stands for the number of columns .",
    "the antisymmetric behavior with respect to @xmath43 is a direct consequence of the fermionic representation .",
    "let us consider the partition function for the hamiltonian , expressed in terms of su(@xmath17 ) generators @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the trace taken with constraints ( [ gconst ] ) . as it is shown in @xcite , the partition function of @xmath0 model",
    "is related to partition function of corresponding fermion model through the following equation : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a distribution function of imaginary lagrange multipliers .",
    "we calculate @xmath47 explicitely using constraints ( [ gconst ] ) .",
    "we use the path integral representation of the partition function @xmath48 where the actions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined by @xmath51 and the fermionic representation of su(@xmath17 ) generators ( [ fermi ] ) is applied .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath52 .",
    "we denote the corresponding distribution by @xmath53 , where @xmath41 is the number of particles in the su(@xmath17 ) orbital , or in other words , @xmath54 labels the different fundamental representations of su(@xmath17 ) . @xmath55 to satisfy this requirement , the minimal set of chemical potentials and the corresponding form of @xmath53 are to be derived .",
    "to derive the distribution function , we use the following identity for the constraint ( [ const1 ] ) expressed in terms of grassmann variables @xmath56 substituting this identity into ( [ z1 ] ) and comparing with ( [ z2 ] ) one gets @xmath57 where @xmath58 since the hamiltonian is symmetric under the exchange of particles and holes when the sign of the lagrange multiplier is also changed simultaneously , we can simplify ( [ eq : p_v1 ] ) to @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the integer part of @xmath61 . as shown below ,",
    "this is the minimal representation of the distribution function corresponding to the minimal set of the discrete imaginary lagrange multipliers .",
    "another distributions function different from ( [ dfu ] ) can be constructed when the sum is taken from @xmath62 to @xmath17 . nevertheless , this df is different from ( [ dfu ] ) only by the sign of imaginary lagrange multipliers @xmath63 and thus is supplementary to ( [ dfu ] ) .    particularly interesting for even @xmath17",
    "is the case when the su(@xmath17 ) orbital is half  filled , @xmath64 .",
    "then all lagrange multipliers carry equal weight @xmath65 taking the limit @xmath66 one may replace the summation in expression ( [ nn2 ] ) in a suitable way by integration . note , that while taking @xmath66 and @xmath67 limits , we nevertheless keep the ratio @xmath68 fixed . then , the following limiting distribution function can be obtained : @xmath69 resulting in the usual continuous representation of the local constraint for the simplest case @xmath52 @xmath70 we note the obvious similarity of the limiting df ( [ pg ] ) with the _ gibbs canonical distribution _ provided that the wick rotation from the imaginary axis of the lagrange multipliers @xmath71 to the real axis of energies @xmath72 is performed and thus @xmath73 has a meaning of energy .    up to now , the representation we discussed was purely fermionic and expressed in terms of usual grassmann variables when the path integral formalism is applied .",
    "the only difference from slave fermionic approach is that imaginary lagrange multipliers are introduced to fulfill the constraint .",
    "nevertheless , by making the replacement @xmath74 we arrive at the generalized grassmann ( semi - fermionic ) boundary conditions @xmath75 this leads to a temperature diagram technique for the green s functions @xmath76 of semi - fermions with matsubara frequencies different from both fermi and bose representations ( see fig.[fig : frequencies_spin ] ) .    the exclusion principle for this case",
    "is illustrated on fig.[fig : su(n)_rep ] , where the @xmath3 representation for the first two groups su(2 ) and su(4 ) are shown .",
    "the first point to observe is that the spin hamiltonian does not distinguish the @xmath77 particle and the @xmath77 hole ( or @xmath78 particle ) subspace .",
    "( [ eq : mu_k ] ) shows that the two phase factors @xmath79 and @xmath80 accompanying these subspaces in eq .",
    "( [ dfu ] ) add up to a purely imaginary value within the same lagrange multiplier , and the empty and the fully occupied states are always canceled . in the case of @xmath81 , where we have multiple lagrange multipliers , the distribution function",

    "we note that in @xmath106 ( or @xmath66 ) limit , the continuum `` chemical potentials '' play the role of additional u(1 ) fluctuating field whereas for finite @xmath85 and @xmath17 they are characterized by fixed and discrete values .",
    "when @xmath85 assumes integer values , the minimal fundamental set of matsubara frequencies is given by the table in fig.[fig : frequencies_spin ] .",
    "the exclusion principle for su(2 ) in the large spin limit can be also understood with the help of fig.[fig : su(n)_rep ] and fig.[fig : spin_rep ] .",
    "one can see that the empty and the fully occupied states are canceled in each given circle similarly to even-@xmath17 su(@xmath17 ) algebra .",
    "the particle - hole ( ph ) symmetry of the representation results in an equivalence of single occupied and @xmath93 occupied states whereas all the other states are canceled due to proper weights in the distribution function ( [ lsu ] ) . in accordance with ph symmetry",
