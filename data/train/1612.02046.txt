    "silicon strip and pixel detectors are widely used to provide accurate position information regarding charged particles emitted in nuclear and particle physics experiments . to measure energetic light charged particles , such as protons or alphas with @xmath3 mev , which will penetrate through the thickest commercially available si strip detectors , si detectors",
    "are often backed by scintillators with thickness between 1 to 10 cm . of the various scintillators",
    "suitable for detecting charged particles , thallium doped csi crystals have the virtue of scintillating at wavelengths that can be measured with silicon photodiodes . with energy resolutions for charged particle that are typically better than 1% , they are easily machined and are only mildly hygroscopic in air .",
    "their cost also make them a popular choice to construct highly - efficient arrays @xcite .",
    "[ fig : csirange ] shows the maximum measurable energies of @xmath4he and @xmath2 particles as a function of the csi thickness . as the electronic stopping power decreases inversely with the energy of the detected particle , the scintillator thickness required to stop a particle increases rapidly with energy . while longer crystals allow detection of higher energy particles , the efficiency for the measurement of the full energies of these particles decreases with energy due to scattering and reaction losses within the scintillator .",
    "this paper focuses on calculating the loss in detection efficiencies of light particles as functions of the particle type and the detector thickness . as the energy of a particle increases , its range in the csi crystal increases and the probability that the particle will undergo a nuclear reaction becomes more significant @xcite .",
    "in addition , there can be losses due to coulomb multiple - scattering that occurs whenever the scattering deflects the charged particle out of the csi crystal before it deposits its total energy .",
    "such multiple scattering effects have been neglected in some previous calculations of reaction losses @xcite where it may have been justified by the geometry of the crystal .",
    "we show , however , that this can be important whenever the charged particles pass sufficiently close to the inner boundaries of the crystals in close - packed arrays .",
    "energy range for @xmath5 ( blue line , closed circle ) , @xmath6 ( dashed line , open circle ) , @xmath7 ( red line , closed diamond ) , @xmath1he ( dashed line , open star ) and @xmath2 ( solid line , closed star ) as a function of the csi thickness.,width=325 ]",
    "the method described in this paper can be applied to any si - csi detection system . to provide concrete examples ,",
    "we have performed the simulations on individual telescopes of the large area silicon array ( lassa ) @xcite , the high resolution array @xcite and the mur  strip ( must2 ) @xcite .",
    "the configuration for each telescope used in this work consists of a double sided silicon detector ( dssd ) backed by a close - packed array of 4 , 4 and 16 csi scintillator crystals corresponding to detection in the hira , lassa or must2 arrays respectively .",
    "these telescopes were chosen because the authors are familiar with these devices and because they have geometries that are similar to other existing or planned arrays where we expect the present calculations can be of assistance in estimating the magnitude of such effects .",
    "we note however that most measurements with hira have utilized shorter 4 cm csi crystals ( hira ) .",
    "the recently completed upgraded hira array referred as hira10 in this paper has 10 cm crystals .",
    "relevant details of the telescopes used in the simulations are listed in table  [ tab_telescope ] .    a typical schematic drawing of a close - packed 2@xmath82 crystal configuration is shown in fig .  [ fig : geometry_crystal ] to illustrate the design of the hira and lassa arrays .",
    "the square dssd has an active area of @xmath9 mm@xmath10 backed with 4 identical crystals .",
    "each crystal is @xmath11 mm long , with a front width of @xmath12 mm and a back width of @xmath13 mm . in order to minimize the multiple scattering effects on the outer edges of the crystal ,",
    "the front width of two crystals is larger than the active area of the silicon detector as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_crystal ] with @xmath14 .",
    "the larger edges of the crystals allows the particles to go deeper into the crystal while reducing the efficiency loss near the outer edges of the crystals due to multiple scattering .",
    "some details for the geometry of the hira10 and lassa arrays are listed in table .",
    "[ tab_crystal_geo ] .    for these calculations ,",
    "we have adopted the nptool framework @xcite that takes the full advantages of both root analysis framework @xcite and geant4 simulation toolkits @xcite .",
    "the nptool framework utilizes geant4 version 10.01 , a monte carlo particle transport model that include the electromagnetic processes or hadronic processes or both .",
    "these processes can occur when the particles travel through the detector materials .",
    "in addition , the calculations for the must2 array utilize c++ classes that were developed within the nptool framework @xcite .",
    "we developed analogous new classes for the lassa and hira10 detectors so that all the different simulations and analysis are done consistently .",
    "these calculations take into account the known intrinsic energy resolution of different elements of the telescopes .",
    "in this work we will focus on the detection of light charged particles with mass number @xmath15 , i.e. protons to @xmath2 particles .",
    "similar calculations can be performed for any kind of charged particle . in the following ,",
    "the effects of coulomb multiple scattering are explored separately in section 2.1 and in conjunction with reaction losses in section 2.2 .       99 a. wagner _",
