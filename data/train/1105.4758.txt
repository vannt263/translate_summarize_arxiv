    "<S> we analytically show that a gap is induced around the dirac point in the electronic spectrum of a previously metallic nanotube , in the presence of electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the tube axis . for realistic values of the fields , a gap of at least a few mev can appear . despite the quasi - one dimensional nature of the system , </S>",

    "<S> this is revealed when the flux through the tube is varied by one flux quantum , which leads to exactly one electron per spin being transported between the ends of the tube .    the behavior of electrons in carbon nanotubes under the influence of magnetic fields has received both theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite attention . when a strong magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the tube axis , the fermi velocity of states around the dirac points is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this `` flattening out '' of the dispersion relation is reminiscent of the dispersionless landau levels in a 2d sample exposed to a constant magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to ask whether a carbon nanotube in a perpendicular magnetic field supports a hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> one type of hall effect has already been pointed out theoretically@xcite . in a strong magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> we study a different type of hall effect . in order to observe it , </S>",
    "<S> a gapped state is induced by means of an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism that is responsible for the gap is the same as in ref .. when the fermi energy is in this gap , a circumferential electric field induces a current along the tube axis . at the heart of the effect </S>",
    "<S> is the anomalous velocity of karplus and luttinger@xcite and the berry curvature of the band structure of dirac fermions@xcite . to make a link with the two dimensional topological invariant that appear in this context , a further magnetic field , parallel to the tube axis is introduced . the resulting flux through the tube plays the role of crystal momentum in the transverse direction in this one - dimensional system@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our main results are the following . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic and electric fields perpendicular to the tube axis produce a gap around the dirac point in the electronic spectrum ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[mu ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a magnetic field of @xmath0 t together with an electric field of @xmath1v/@xmath2 m produces a gap of @xmath3mev in a tube with radius @xmath4 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an expression for the hall conductance when the fermi energy is in the gap ( eq.[sigma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that varying the flux through the tube by one flux quantum @xmath5 , leads to exactly one electron per spin being transported between the ends of the tube . </S>",
    "<S> the argument is the reverse of laughlin s argument for the quantization of the hall effect@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these effects occur when electrons are confined to a single graphene sheet that is rolled up into a cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to vary the flux through the cylinder by at least one flux quantum . in a @xmath6 t field parallel to the cylinder axis , this requires a radius of @xmath7 nm or more . </S>",
    "<S> single wall tubes found to date have radii @xmath8nm@xcite and are therefore too narrow to contain a quantum of flux . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wall carbon nanotubes on the other hand have outer radii of several tens of nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> there is experimental evidence@xcite that at low temperatures , and small bias voltages , transport in a multi - wall tube is confined to the outermost wall . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect that effects considered in this letter can be observed in multi - wall nanotubes .    </S>",
    "<S> however , since a multi - wall tube is not the cleanest system to display the effect@xcite , we also mention another possible experimental method to obtain the system we consider . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to manufacture an ultra - wide single wall tube starting from a multi - wall tube and manually removing all the inner cylinders . </S>",
