    "there is currently renewed interest in the understanding of multi - exciton complexes in highly excited semiconductor nanostructures and their interaction with light .",
    "two examples are bi - exciton - exciton cascade for the generation of entangled photon pairs in self - assembled quantum dots@xcite and enhancing the efficiency of photovoltaic cells by generation of multi - exciton complexes ( meg ) from a single , high - energy photon absorbed in semiconductor nanocrystals ( ncs).@xcite while much progress has been achieved in the understanding of multi - exciton complexes in self - assembled quantum dots@xcite and nanocrystals,@xcite the mixing and decay of complexes with different numbers of excitons are much less understood .",
    "these processes are important for the understanding of decoherence in entangled photon pairs and energy - to - charge conversion .",
    "nozik@xcite has put forward a proposal of converting the energy of the high - energy exciton generated by a high energy photon into several low - energy electron - hole pairs rather than allowing this energy to be dissipated . the theoretical threshold photon energy , at which the excited exciton is expected to convert into a biexciton , depends on the nanocrystal size , but is typically about twice the semiconductor bandgap , @xmath1 .",
    "such carrier multiplication process has been demonstrated in pbse , pbs , pbte , cdse , inas , and si ncs,@xcite with efficiency reaching 700% ( seven electron - hole pairs out of one photon).@xcite however , a careful analysis of these experiments revised these efficiencies to lower values.@xcite    coherent coupling of bi - exciton to highly excited exciton can lead to coherent conversion from biexciton to exciton and vice versa .",
    "however , phonon - assisted relaxation in the exciton subsystem was suggested to destroy coherence and leads to finite bi - exciton lifetime.@xcite exact theoretical estimation of this lifetime is challenging , as even a realistic computation of single - particle states in ncs is difficult : for example , for a cdse nc with diameter of @xmath2 nm with @xmath3 atoms , in the energy range of @xmath4 there are approximately @xmath5 exciton and @xmath6 bi - exciton states .",
    "as an approximation , one typically starts with the computation of nc single - particle states using the @xmath7  @xcite , tight - binding@xcite or empirical pseudopotential methods.@xcite next , one builds the electron - hole pair configurations to be coupled , e.g. , the exciton ( x ) and bi - exciton ( xx ) of similar energy , and neglects all coulomb coupling ( correlations ) within each subsystem .",
    "finally , one computes the coulomb coupling matrix element between the chosen x and xx configurations and computes the lifetime of the xx state using the fermi s golden rule.@xcite as typically there are many x states close in energy to the xx state , one utilizes a quasi - resonant approach , scaling the xx - x transition rate by the density of x states and/or using a `` resonance window''.@xcite    a more advanced approach was presented recently by witzel _",
    "et al._@xcite in this work , a time - dependent evolution of a single - photon excitation coupled coherently with multi - exciton states , considered in the @xmath7 approach , is simulated .",
    "decay of each multiexciton state is accounted for in the relaxation - time approximation .",
    "it is shown that the relaxation times of different multiexciton complexes , and in particular that of x , play a crucial role in the efficiency of meg .",
    "engineering of materials and nanostructures directed at optimization of the meg gain requires therefore a comprehensive , microscopic theory of ( i ) coupling of multiexciton states with different number of excitations , and ( ii ) relaxation processes of these multiexciton states . in this work we focus on the former , as the latter requires an additional realistic simulation of the phonon modes in the nc and a treatment of the carrier - phonon coupling.@xcite we provide a detailed derivation of the coulomb matrix element coupling the multi - electron - hole configurations differing by one electron - hole pair.@xcite further , we express the states of the system in the basis of configurations with different number of excitations .",
    "the form of this expansion is obtained by exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian accounting for _ all _ coulomb interactions of quasiparticles . from such an eigenstate",
    "we extract the spectral function of the state with the larger number of pair excitations , assuming that it is `` immersed '' in a dense spectrum of the states with fewer pairs . to make contact with the language of the state lifetime , used in experiments , we relate the amplitude and the characteristic width of this spectral function to the amplitude and time constants of the coherent time evolution of the system .",
    "we illustrate this framework on the mixing of x and xx in a spherical cdse nanocrystal .",
    "the current work is built upon our recent calculation of the electronic and optical properties of low energy x and xx states in the cdse nc.@xcite we utilize the qnano computational platform@xcite to carry out atomistic tight - binding computation of the single - particle states in the nc with diameter of @xmath8 nm .",
    "these states are used to construct the _ correlated _ ground state of the xx as well as the excited states @xmath9 with energies close to that of the xx .",
    "from the exact diagonalization of the xx interacting with @xmath9 in this energy range we extract the spectral function of the xx ground state and discuss its properties in connection with the coherent time evolution of the coupled system without relaxation .",
    "for the nc studied we find that the xx-@xmath9 coupling is weak , resulting in quantum beats between the xx and @xmath9 states . we demonstrate that contact with the description of the xx population in terms of lifetime can be established only if very fast decay of the @xmath9 states due to phonons is assumed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a framework theoretical approach to the system in which the multiexciton states differing in the number of excitations are coupled .",
    "we establish the general form of the hamiltonian for the system , and , on an example of the @xmath10 system , demonstrate the derivation of the coupling coulomb matrix elements .",
    "we write the eigenstates of the coupled system , define the spectral function of the system of @xmath11 electron - hole pairs immersed in the spectrum of @xmath12 and @xmath13-pair excitations , and relate this function to the time evolution of the system .",
    "we illustrate these concepts in detail in section iii on the example of the coupled @xmath14 system confined in a single cdse nanocrystal . in section",
    "iv we present conclusions and outlook .",
    "in this section we present a general derivation of the coulomb matrix elements which couple the multiexciton configurations differing in the number of electron - hole pairs .",
    "we demonstrate how to include these elements in the exact diagonalization study of the mixed system and how to extract physically relevant quantities from that calculation .",
    "we start the derivation by writing the all - electron hamiltonian for the semiconductor nanostructure .",
    "if by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) we denote the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron on state @xmath17 , we have : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the single - particle energies of the nanostructure , while @xmath20 are the coulomb scattering matrix elements computed for the single - particle states .",
    "since in the typical ncs we deal with @xmath21 atoms , or @xmath22 electrons , we can not treat the above hamiltonian directly and introduce the language of quasiparticles . to this end",
    ", we divide the basis of single - particle states into two sets : the valence states , henceforth enumerated by greek indices , and the conduction states , enumerated with latin indices . as a result ,",
    "the first term of the above hamiltonian will split into two , while the coulomb operator will result in the appearance of @xmath23 terms . among these terms",
    "there are those which describe the interaction of carriers on conduction states only , as well as that of carriers on valence states only .",
    "further , we find terms describing the interaction between conduction and valence carriers , consisting of the direct and exchange component .",
    "next , we have terms which describe all possibilities of the coulomb scattering with transfer of one carrier from the valence to conduction band or the other way around .",
    "all of them consist of the `` direct''-like and `` exchange''-like component . finally , there are terms describing the coulomb scattering with transfer of _ two _ carriers , from the valence to conduction band and the other way around . due to the two - body character of coulomb interactions ,",
    "the above hamiltonian exhausts all possibilities of coulomb scattering in the system .",
    "we shall write all these terms explicitely below .    in order to complete the transition into the language of quasiparticles ,",
    "we define the `` vacuum '' reference state of our system , in which all valence orbitals are occupied , and all conduction orbitals are empty : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the true zero - electron state .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is treated as the reference level . in what follows",
    ", we will consider the charge - neutral electron - hole excitations from that state , which can be written as @xmath28 here the hole creation ( annihilation ) operators are defined as @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "as is evident from the discussion opening this section , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_complete ] ) describes direct coupling of a configuration with @xmath11 electron - hole pairs and configurations with @xmath31 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath32 pairs .",
    "however , we need to translate it into the language of quasiparticle operators . by replacing the valence operators with the hole operators and rearranging terms , we obtain : @xmath33 where the part conserving the number of excitations is @xmath34 and the part changing the number of excitations is @xmath35 in the above hamiltonian , the single - particle energies are those of quasiparticles , and therefore have to be properly dressed in selfenergy and vertex correction terms .",
    "we shall not analyze them in greater detail , as all methods of calculation of the single - particle structure , i.e. , @xmath7 , tight - binding , or pseudopotential approaches , at some point are fitted to the experimental bandgaps , and therefore are parametrised with already dressed single - particle energies .",
    "note that all coulomb elements are computed with previous , electron rather than the quasiparticle orbitals .",
    "these orbitals are computed directly in the single - particle methods and care must be taken to translate the coulomb elements into the quasiparticle language .",
    "for example , the hole coulomb matrix element @xmath36 , that is , it is a complex conjugate of the electron element , while the relation for electron - hole interactions is even more complicated .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) allows to appreciate the terms changing the number of excitations in a clearer fashion : the terms changing the number of excitations by one have three quasielectron and one hole operators ( or conversely ) , while the terms changing the number of excitations by two are built of four creation or four annihilation operators .    in semiconductor",
    "nanostructures the scattering with transfer of one carrier must necessarily modify the energy of a configuration by at least one gap energy @xmath37 , while the transfer of two carriers introduces a modification of at least @xmath1 .",
    "the largest mixing of configurations with different numbers of excitations will be seen for configurations close in energy .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain coupling between a low - lying two - pair excitation , or bi - exciton ( xx ) , and an exciton ( x ) , one has to consider highly excited exciton states ( excited by at least @xmath37).@xcite the x - xx - tri - exciton mixing will start at even higher energies ( of at least @xmath38 ) , i.e. , both x and xx must be highly excited .",
    "we shall describe this case here in a greater detail .",
    "let us first write explicitely the coulomb matrix elements coupling the x and xx .",
    "we couple a one - electron - hole - pair configuration @xmath39 with a two - pair configuration @xmath40 and obtain:@xcite @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left [   \\left ( \\langle \\alpha j|v_{ee}|\\gamma\\beta \\rangle - \\langle \\alpha j|v_{ee}|    \\beta\\gamma\\rangle \\right ) \\delta_{ik } \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left .",
    "\\left ( \\langle \\alpha",
    "k|v_{ee}|\\beta \\gamma   \\rangle - \\langle \\alpha k|v_{ee}|\\gamma \\beta \\rangle \\right ) \\delta_{ij } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{mixing_element}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above formula , the terms in the first square bracket apply to the scattering event whereby the creation of an electron - hole pair is accompanied by a scattering of the electron constituting the exciton , while the exciton s hole _ must not _ change its orbital .",
    "the second square bracket contains analogous terms for the case when the exciton s hole is scattered , but its electron must stay on the same orbital .",
    "this gives a selection rule for the pair creation process : the exciton and biexciton configurations must share at least one carrier .",
    "the process in which the hole is shared is illustrated in the transition fig .",
    "[ fig0](a)-(b ) .     appearing as a result of this scattering event",
    "is marked with the rectangles.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) we show schematically a one - pair configuration , in which the hole occupies the single - particle ground state , while the electron is highly excited . in the scattering process , the electron transfers to a lower single - particle level , while an additional electron - hole pair is created . in fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) this negatively charged trion complex @xmath42 is marked with the rectangle , with the empty circle denoting the initial level of the excited electron .",
    "note that the shared hole is a spectator quasiparticle and does not take part in this process .",
    "the scattering event with shared electron would conform to similar rules , only in this case we would deal with a highly excited hole converting to a positively charged trion , while the shared electron would be inert . in the case of the x - xx coupling , the selection rule severely limits the number of excited x configurations to which any xx configuration can couple directly",
    ". henceforth we shall refer to these exciton configurations as @xmath43 .",
    "however , there are also excited x configurations , which are not directly coupled to the xx configuration , but do couple to @xmath43 .",
    "these configurations shall be referred to as @xmath44 .",
    "we shall discuss the importance of @xmath44 later on .",
    "let us now move on to the coupling between the two- and three - pair excitations , whose one variant is visualized schematically in the transition fig .",
    "[ fig0](b)-(c ) .",
    "the matrix element between the two - pair configuration @xmath40 and the three - pair configuration @xmath45 is computed similarly to the one connecting the one- and two - pair configurations .",
    "we shall not write it here as it is composed of a large number of terms describing various permutations of particles .",
    "let us only emphasize that the scattering process involves a creation of a negatively charged trion @xmath42 out of one excited electron , or a positively charged trion out of one excited hole , just as in the case of the x - xx coupling .",
    "figure  [ fig0](c ) depicts the former , as the excited electron is scattered down the ladder of single - particle states ( blue arrow ) with a simultaneous creation of the third electron - hole pair ( red arrow ) .",
    "the resulting negatively charged trion is denoted in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) by the blue rectangle .",
    "the remaining three `` spectator '' particles are inert and form a positively charged trion @xmath46 .",
    "finally , there is also a possibility of coupling the one- and three - pair exictations directly via the two last terms of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) .",
    "however , in this case the energies of the configurations must necessarily differ by at least @xmath1 .",
    "this is why in the following we shall neglect this term .",
    "presently we solve for the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system with a non - constant number of excitations .",
    "to this end , we use a procedure consisting of two steps .",
    "first , we solve for eigenstates and eigenenergies of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) in the subspaces spanned by the configurations with a _ conserved _ number of excitations . in this case , only the first five terms of that hamiltonian are considered .",
    "we solve this problem in the exact diagonalization approach , in which the hamiltonian matrix is written in the basis of configurations of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ ehconfig ] ) and diagonalized numerically . as a result of this procedure ,",
    "for a system with @xmath11 electron - hole pairs we obtain the eigenstates of the form @xmath47 where the coefficients @xmath48 compose the @xmath49-th eigenvector of the hamiltonian matrix , and the energy of this state is @xmath50 . since the number of possible @xmath11-pair configurations can be very large , we restrict the basis to the region of energies of interest and control the convergence of the resulting energy levels with the width of that region .    in the second step , utilizing the energies and eigenstates of systems with conserved excitation numbers , we set up the full matrix of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) .",
    "the only nondiagonal elements in this matrix will result from the hamiltonian terms changing the number of excitations .",
    "they are computed as linear combinations , which , for example , for the coupled @xmath43-xx system take the form : @xmath51 note that although the individual coupling elements under the sum may vanish due to the selection rule described above , the elements connecting the correlated states may still be finite .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix to obtain the eigenstates with mixed number of excitations .",
    "the @xmath52-th state can be written as the linear combination : @xmath53 the energy of this state is referred to as @xmath54 .",
    "the degree of mixing between states with different number of excitations can be extracted from the eigenstates @xmath55 by calculating the spectral function @xmath56 of the @xmath49-th state with @xmath11 electron - hole pairs @xmath57 .",
    "this function is computed as @xmath58 and , for example , for the @xmath49-th biexciton state will take the form @xmath59 , i.e. , it is readily obtained from the eigenvectors of the system . for weak coupling",
    "we expect that the spectral function will have the value close to @xmath60 for @xmath52 such that @xmath61 , and decay as we move to the other eigenstates @xmath55 .    in practice , one is typically interested in the lifetime of the multiexciton state and attempts to engineer the system so as to achieve long lifetimes of states with many excitons .",
    "if the dynamics of the system is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) only and is not changed by any incoherent relaxation processes , we can trace the time evolution of the state @xmath62 of the coupled system simply by @xmath63 assuming that the system is prepared in the state @xmath57 . since @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 and we can observe the time evolution of our state by computing the projection @xmath66 .",
    "the time evolution of the system , and in particular the change of the number of excitations from the one prepared in the system , is related to the fourier transform of the spectral function in the time domain . at this point",
    "it is useful to consider two limiting examples of the spectral function .",
    "first , if @xmath56 is finite only for several states @xmath52 , we may expect a complex time evolution , with oscillating contributions from all these states .",
    "second , if our state @xmath57 is immersed in a quasi - continuous spectrum of other states ( possibly with different @xmath11 ) and if its spectral function can be approximated by a lorentzian , @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 on resonance , then the time evolution is described by an exponential decay , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being the characteristic width of the spectral function . at long times and with strong mixing ( the value of @xmath71 )",
    ", the state of the system can no longer be identified with the state @xmath57 , as the probability density is distributed _ coherently _ in the multitude of states of the system .",
    "the above analysis shows that the characteristic decay time constant @xmath72 is _ not _ related simply to the bare coupling between the state @xmath57 and other states _ at the same energy _",
    ", as this will predominantly affect the spectral function maximum value @xmath73 .",
    "the dynamics of this `` dissolution '' of our state @xmath57 is decided by its coupling to states off - resonance : the stronger that coupling , the broader the spectral function and the faster the decay .",
    "note also that the probability of finding the system in the state @xmath57 does not decay to zero , but rather the amplitude @xmath74 .",
    "we shall supplement this intuitive picture with a detailed analysis of the dynamics in the next section .",
    "in this section we apply the general approach to describing the dynamics of the bi - exciton xx in a cdse nanocrystal with diameter of @xmath8 nm , as studied in ref .  .",
    "we choose to focus on the low - energy xx states , which allows us to consider their coupling only to excited exciton states of similar energy .",
    "below we will discuss the entire procedure , starting from the computation of single - particle states , then the correlated states of x and xx , coupling matrix elements , treatment of the mixed system and extraction and analysis of the spectral function .",
    "we start the parametrization of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) with the computation of single - particle states and their energies . to this end",
    "we utilize the atomistic tight - binding @xmath75 approach .",
    "we look for the single - particle wave function @xmath17 in the form of a linear combination @xmath76 of atomic orbitals @xmath77 .",
    "the index @xmath78 enumerates the types of orbitals ( @xmath79 , three @xmath49 , five @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , of which all are degenerate spin - doublets ) , while the index @xmath82 enumerates atoms . the coefficients @xmath83 and the energies @xmath84 of states are computed by diagonalizing the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath85 written in the basis of atomic orbitals .",

    "the overlap between the relevant orbitals appears to be more substantial , resulting in a much larger coupling of @xmath113 ev .",
    "note that all these matrix elements are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those connecting different two - pair configurations to each other.@xcite      we now proceed to computing the electronic properties and dynamics of the coupled xx - x system .",
    "according to the procedure described in section  [ eigenstates_mixed ] , having diagonalized the xx subsystem separately , we should now perform a separate diagonalization of the x subsystem and then connect the two .",
    "we found , however , that a more computationally efficient procedure involves writing the entire hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) in the basis of the single - pair and two - pair configurations .",
    "this is due to the fact that in such large bases , the calculation of elements ( [ coupling_correlated ] ) coupling correlated @xmath43 and xx states takes a very long time .    in order to be able to compute the spectral function , we require all the eigenstates of the coupled system .",
    "this sets another limit of the basis size , which , by necessity , was chosen to be about @xmath114 basis states : @xmath115 of the two - pair , and @xmath116 of the single - pair configurations . as a result , the eigenstates of the coupled system , defined in eq .",
    "( [ mixed_state ] ) , can be written as @xmath117 while the pure xx states are described by eq .",
    "( [ correlated_biexciton ] ) .",
    "since the spectral function is defined in terms of a projection of one of the xx states onto the spectrum @xmath55 , in this case we have : @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot the spectral function @xmath119 of the xx ground state ( @xmath120 ) as a function of the energy of the eigenstates of the coupled system .",
    "the red vertical lines represent the xx ( i.e. , not mixed with @xmath121 ) eigenstates , while the gray vertical lines denote the energies @xmath122 of the mixed eigenstates @xmath55 .",
    "the values of the spectral functions for different @xmath52 are represented by the height of the blue bars .",
    "we find that the value of the spectral function is @xmath123 at the energy corresponding to that of the unmixed xx ground state , and smaller by about an order of magnitude at the energy corresponding to the next state @xmath55 .",
    "its value falls off very fast as we move away from this energy , becoming negligibly small already at about @xmath60 mev away .",
    "we conclude that our xx level is coupled very weakly to the underlying spectrum of the @xmath109 states and is not resonant with any of them .",
    "next we examine how this weak coupling translates into the dynamics of the coupled system .",
    "we assume that the system is prepared in the xx ground state and simulate its time evolution as described in section  [ spectral_theory ] .",
    "the resulting probability of finding the system in the state @xmath124 at time @xmath125 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "we find that this probability oscillates around the value of @xmath126 with no appreciable decay .",
    "the oscillations are not regular , as there are several states which are effectively coupled to @xmath124 and the values of coupling elements vary strongly from state to state .",
    "it is clear , however , that we can not define the xx lifetime in our system in a meaningful fashion .",
    "the treatment of our system in terms of the coherent evolution of weakly coupled multiexciton states does not reflect the experimental situation , in which finite lifetimes , of order of tens of picoseconds , are found.@xcite in section  [ spectral_theory ] we have demonstrated that we can obtain a population of the multiexciton state which decays in time even within the coherent model if its spectral function is sufficiently broad . in our system , such broadening can occur as a result of mixing of the @xmath109 one - pair configurations , which can be directly coupled to the two - pair configurations , and the @xmath127 one pair configurations , which exhibit no such coupling . to account for this mixing , however",
    ", we would have to generate _ all _ the single - pair configurations with energies falling into the chosen energy window .",
    "this results in prohibitively large basis sizes .",
    "the second broadening mechanism involves relaxation of the one - pair configurations due to phonons .",
    "such relaxation is not relevant for the xx subsystem , as we focus on the xx ground state only .",
    "coherent simulations of the time evolution of such a system have been reported,@xcite however there the electronic structure was computed within the four - band @xmath7 approach .",
    "our simulations on model systems indicated that if the relaxation times of the single - pair states are very short , the dynamics of the biexciton can be described by a single lifetime obtained using the fermi s golden rule@xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the ground state energy of the biexciton state and @xmath130 is the energy of the @xmath131-th exciton state .",
    "the influence of scattering and relaxation processes is introduced into this rule by broadening the delta function such that @xmath132 $ ] , where @xmath133 is a model broadening . in an attempt to model fast relaxation processes ,",
    "one typically chooses @xmath133 to be sufficiently large so that the result of the calculation does not depend on it .    to make contact with previous work,@xcite we begin by assuming that the states @xmath124 and @xmath134 are uncorrelated and are simply represented by the two - pair and one - pair configurations , respectively .",
    "the single - pair energies are computed as the respective expectation values of the quasi - particle hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_quasiparticle ] ) : @xmath135 . on the other hand",
    ", we treat the xx energy @xmath129 as an independent variable , whose value will be tuned artificially in order to examine the values of lifetimes over an energy region . however , to compute the matrix element we always use the xx ground state .    in fig  [ fig8 ]",
    "we show the lifetimes computed as a function of the biexciton energy for four broadenings @xmath133 .",
    "mev ( gray ) , @xmath136 mev ( green ) , and @xmath137 mev ( magenta ) . both exciton and bi - exciton states",
    "are uncorrelated.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the actual ground - state energy of the uncorrelated xx is marked with the black arrow , while the energy corresponding to the fully correlated xx is denoted by the red arrow .",
    "we find that for a small broadening of @xmath138 mev , the lifetime as a function of the xx energy exhibits very fast oscillations over many orders of magnitude .",
    "increasing the broadening leads to averaging of these oscillations and an emergence of a monotonic dependence of @xmath139 on @xmath129 .",
    "this dependence seems to be converged for @xmath140 mev .",
    "we find that the lifetime increases with the energy , which is consistent with the decrease of the coupling element with energy ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in general , we find that depending on the biexciton energy the calculated lifetimes can vary from about @xmath141 ps to about @xmath142 ps . as we change the xx energy from its uncorrelated to correlated value , the lifetime changes by a factor of @xmath143 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that accounting for correlations in the many - body states is of crucial importance .    finally , we examine how the xx lifetime changes if we also include correlations in the many - body states , i.e. , depending upon how we compute the coupling matrix element in the fermi s golden rule .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the lifetime as a function of energy assuming that the x states are correlated while the xx state is not ( a ) and the other way around ( b ) .",
    "preparation of the x states in their correlated form does not introduce any drastic changes into the lifetime .",
    "these correlations can be modeled essentially by an additional broadening in the density of states of single - pair configurations . on the other hand , introducing correlations into the xx ground state increases the lifetime by about a factor of @xmath144 for lower energies , while for higher energies the lifetime is reduced by a factor of @xmath136 . clearly , the xx lifetime strongly depends on the details of the sample and its coupling with relaxation mechanisms .",
    "detailed _ ab initio _ studies of the nanocrystal electronic structure and coupling with phonons are necessary to obtain predictions of the lifetime which could be compared to the experimental data .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a theory of the coupling between states with different numbers of electron - hole excitations in semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "we have derived the appropriate quasiparticle hamiltonian and demonstrated that the states are coupled by a coulomb interaction element .",
    "this element accounts for the process whereby one electron - hole pair is annihilated and another carrier is scattered within the same band .",
    "we have shown that these processes involve the creation or collapse of a charged trion , while the remaining particles act as spectators .",
    "the general hamiltonian for such a coupled system can be diagonalized exactly in the basis of states with different number of excitations .",
    "the spectral function of the state with higher number of pairs among the states with fewer pairs was calculated and shown to be related to the time - dependent evolution of the system by the fourier transform .",
    "this methodology was applied to analyzing the dynamics of the bi - exciton ( xx ) state immersed in the excited exciton ( x ) states of similar energy confined in a cdse spherical nanocrystal .",
    "the nc single - particle energies and states were computed within the @xmath75 tight - binding approach and the coulomb scattering matrix elements were obtained with these atomistically resolved wave functions .",
    "we derived the spectral function of the xx ground state immersed in the excited exciton states for an example nanoscrystal of @xmath8 nm diameter .",
    "we found that the ground xx state is coupled only to a few @xmath9 states close to it in energy .",
    "this property was reflected in the time evolution of the state of the coupled system , which involved clear coherent oscillations in the population of the xx state without decay .",
    "lifetime of the xx state could be defined only by introducing additional coupling of excited exciton states and their nonradiative decay mediated by phonons .",
    "the exciton - phonon coupling was accounted for in a model fashion by broadening the resonance condition in the fermi s golden rule treatment of the xx lifetime .",
    "we found that the lifetime is very sensitive to that broadening ( characteristic relaxation times ) , if the broadening itself is small , but has a convergent behavior for large broadenings . on the other hand ,",
    "a large change in the xx lifetime was seen when the correlated character of the xx state was accounted for . to investigate this dependence further",
    ", we plan to improve on the elements of our approach which were carried out in a model fashion : treatment of surface , a simplified treatment of the distance - dependent dielectric function , and the approximate treatment of relaxation mechanisms of the excited exciton states .",
    "such an approach could be used to provide more quantitative estimates of xx lifetime in ncs .",
