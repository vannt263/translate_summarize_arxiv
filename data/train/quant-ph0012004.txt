    "the introduction of complex potentials is generally accepted way to describe absorption at quantum scattering @xcite . based on an analogy with electrodynamics this method can be , nevertheless , disputed in qm because of quite different nature of wave functions and electromagnetic field .",
    "proposed recently approach to the absorption using restricted feynman - type integrals @xcite seems to be more adequate to this problem .",
    "also , absorption can be treated in connection with the well - known problem of collapse of particles scattered by singular potentials @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of regular potentials the scattering by singular potentials leads to two linear independent solutions of radial schrdinger equations that are both square - integrable and form overfull nonorthogonal set .",
    "this means that corresponding hamiltonians are not self - adjoint . to describe elastic scattering",
    "the procedure of self - adjoint extension @xcite has been applied by imposing suitable boundary conditions at singularity points . for the case of the singular attractive potential @xmath1",
    "they have been found in @xcite .    on the contrary , to describe absorption one has to refuse from the self - adjiontness and permit non - hermitean hamiltonians .",
    "they have been first employed with this aim in @xcite where the capture of ions by polarization forces in @xmath2-potential was considered .",
    "such interpretation of the collapse problem has been developed in @xcite for the case of the singular attractive potentials @xmath3    the absorption problem became practically important in last years in connection with atom interferometer experiments on scattering neutral polarizable atoms by a charge wire @xcite as well as with superimposed magnetic field with the aim to observe the effect of the ab topological phase on this process .",
    "these processes are effectively governed by the schrdinger equation with the ab - and the attractive @xmath0 potential in two dimensions .",

    "the partial scattering amplitudes are equal to @xmath66 and the partial absorption cross sections are equal to their maximal values @xmath67    for the intermediate case of eq .",
    "( [ incs2 ] ) the condition of the total absorption @xmath68 is realized if @xmath69 then the corresponding wave function reads @xmath70 we note that absorption can happens for the pure ab scattering when the attractive potential is absent ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "then , for the partial modes with @xmath72 i.e. for the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 it is possible to get any value of the partial absorption cross sections up to its maximal value @xmath75 for the pure attractive potential ( @xmath44 ) the number of modes that can be absorbed , @xmath76 depends on the value of @xmath77",
    "we consider now the schrdinger equation eq .",

    "we keep the ab potential in addition to the potential ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "then the radial equation takes the form @xmath79 and by the substitution @xmath80 can be reduced to the mathieu equation of imaginary argument @xmath81 with the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83    asymptotic behaviour of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) at large @xmath42 ( large positive @xmath84 ) is well known , @xmath85 the mathieu functions eq .",

    "( [ re1 ] ) can be represented by their linear combination @xcite @xmath86 with these radial functions we obtain the following expression for the phase function of eq .",
    "( [ asymr ] ) @xmath87 now we can choose the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath50 in accordance with the different criteria discussed above .",
    "for this aim we have to consider the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) at small @xmath42 ( large negative @xmath84 ) .",
    "there are two other mathieu functions which describe the ingoing and outgoing waves nearby the singularity line @xmath88 @xmath89 which also form a complete set .",
    "now , to work out the elastic scattering , we have to impose the self - adjointness condition on the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ re1 ] ) @xcite , taking the linear combination @xmath90 using their connections with the mathieu functions @xmath91 we obtain the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath50 and the phase function ( [ incs4 ] ) of the elastic scattering . on contrary ,",
    "eliminating of the outgoing wave at @xmath92 to describe absorption we have to connect the solution @xmath93 with the mathieu functions @xmath91 to find another coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 in this way the inelastic scattering of ions by polarization forces has been considered and the capture cross section has been evaluated in @xcite . at least , to get the total absorption of given modes we have to put zero the corresponding coefficients @xmath94    the choice of the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath50 depends on model of absorption under consideration .",
    "for example , one can put @xmath95 for large @xmath96 ( large impact parameters ) and @xmath68 for @xmath97 or to consider a intermediate regime from the elastic scattering to the total absorption .    up to now we dealt with potentials that are singular on the line .",
    "the similar results can be obtained for potentials with singularities on a surface .",
    "for example , one can use the potential that is singular on the cylinderic surface @xmath98 @xmath99 which will imitate absorption in a thin layer of width @xmath100 nearby this surface . of cause ,",
    "the analytical calculations in this case are very cumbersome , if possible .",
    "the main result of the paper is following : if partial wave functions of a quantum mechanical problem are not fixed by the normalization conditions as this happens in the presence of singular potentials , then the corresponding arbitrariness can be used to describe not only elastic scattering but also inelastic one ( absorption ) . by different choice of partial radial wave functions various models of absorption",
    "can be realized , beginning from almost elastic scattering till maximal possible values of partial absorption coefficients .",
    "we give up unsolved very important problem what type of physical situations with regular potentials corresponds in a singular limit to different choice of the partial wave functions describing elastic scattering or absorption .",
