    "a lot of effort has been put into the study and understanding of non - markovian effects and dynamics within the description of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "these efforts have faced quite a huge amount of difficulties arising both because of practical as well as fundamental reasons . indeed , on the one hand the treatment of non - markovian systems is especially demanding because one can not rely on simplifying assumptions such as weak coupling , separation of time scales between system and environment , and the factorization of the system - environment state . on the other hand ,",
    "in the non - markovian case there is no general characterization of the equations of motion , such as in the markovian setting thanks to the theory of quantum dynamical semigroups , and the very notion of non - markovianity in the quantum case still has to be cleared up . in the last few years",
    "this topic has experienced a significant revival , leading to important improvements and to the deeper understanding of quite a few issues in the theory of open quantum systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    apart from the explicit detailed treatment of many specific quantum systems where memory effects show up , efforts have been made to obtain general classes of non - markovian equations leading to well - defined completely positive time evolutions @xcite . at the same time advances",
    "have been made in order to actually define what is meant by a non - markovian quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "this work has raised all sorts of questions regarding the connection among the different approaches , as well as the relationship between the notion of non - markovianity used in classical and quantum setting , together with the quest for clearcut signatures of non - markovian behavior .",
    "the present paper is devoted to address some of these questions , focussing in particular on the connection between the very definition of non - markovian process used in classical probability theory , and the markovian or non - markovian behavior in the dynamics of a physical system .",
    "it will naturally appear that these two notions are quite different .",
    "starting within the classical framework , we will analyze how the non - markovianity of a process reflects itself in the behavior of its one - point probability density , which naturally leads to criteria for the characterization of non - markovian behavior in the dynamics .",
    "these criteria can be extended to the quantum setting , thus providing natural tools to assess the non - markovianity of a quantum time evolution .",
    "they are based on the possibility to connect the probability vectors giving the state of the system at different times through well defined transition matrices , and to the behavior of solutions corresponding to different initial states with respect to the kolmogorov distance .    despite the abstract framework",
    ", the whole presentation is built with reference to explicit examples .",
    "these examples find their common root in being related to realizations of a class of non - markovian processes for which , as an exceptional case , an explicit characterization is available , namely semi - markov processes .",
    "this approach will enable us to construct different non trivial dynamics both in the classical and the quantum case , showing quite different behaviors and amenable to an explicit analysis , both in terms of the previously introduced criteria and of the recently proposed measures of non - markovianity , thus allowing for a concrete comparison of these measures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pcpdiv ] we introduce the notion of classical and quantum map for the dynamics of an open system , introducing the notions of p - divisibility and cp - divisibility which will turn out to be useful in order to compare different behaviors . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cnm ] we recall the notion of non - markovianity for a classical process , showing its relation to the behavior of the one - point probability density .",
    "we further consider examples of classical semi - markov processes characterized by different stochastic matrices and waiting time distributions , studying their p - divisibility and the behavior with respect to the kolmogorov distance . in sect .",
    "[ sec : qnm ] we perform a similar analysis in the quantum setting , considering classes of dynamics which can be related to semi - markov processes .",
    "these dynamics still allow for an exact determination of their divisibility properties and of their quantum measure of non - markovianity according to the recent proposals .",
    "in particular we provide exact expressions for the values of these measures , thus allowing for their explicit comparison .",
    "we further comment on our results in sect .",

    "if the initial state of system and environment factorizes , the dynamics of an open quantum system can be described by a trace preserving completely positive ( cpt ) map , so that the state of the system @xmath1 evolving from an initial state @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 the most general structure of such time evolution maps is not known , apart from the important subclass of maps which obey a semigroup composition law , which can be characterized via a suitable generator @xcite . in order to characterize and actually define markovianity or non - markovianity in this",
    "setting one can follow essentially two approaches : either one assumes that the map @xmath4 is known , and therefore relys on looking at certain mathematical properties of the map itself , which is essentially the path followed in different ways in @xcite ; or one studies the behavior in time of the solutions @xmath1 allowing the initial condition to vary over the possible set of states , which is the approach elaborated in @xcite relying on a suitable notion of distinguishability of quantum states @xcite , an approach which captures the idea of information flow between system and environment .",
    "note that markovianity or non - markovianity should be a property of the map or equivalently of the time evolved states , not of the equations admitting such states as solutions .",
    "indeed quite different form of the equations , e.g. integrodifferential or local in time , might admit the very same solutions , as we shall also see in the examples in sect .",
    "[ sec : qnm ] .",
    "of course , since in a concrete physical setting one is rather faced with the equations of motion rather than with their general solution , it is therefore also of great interest to assess possible links between the equations themselves and the markovian or non - markovian behavior of their solutions .    to better understand and compare these two approaches , besides the notion of complete positivity and trace preservation other finer characterizations of the time evolution map @xmath5 turn out to be useful , where we have set for the sake of simplicity @xmath6 .",
    "if the map @xmath7 can be split according to @xmath8 for any @xmath9 , with @xmath10 itself a cpt map , we say that the map @xmath5 is cp - divisible , which implies that @xmath10 is itself a well - defined time evolution having as domain the whole set of states .",

    "the existence of @xmath10 as a linear map is granted if @xmath11 is invertible , which is typically the case away from isolated points of time , so that @xmath12 the existence of @xmath10 as a linear map , however , does not entail its complete positivity .",
    "indeed , we will say that the map @xmath13 is p - divisible if @xmath10 send states into states but is only positive , and that it is indivisible if neither p - divisibility nor cp - divisibility hold .",

    "its matrix elements satisfy therefore @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which provide the necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring that probability vectors are sent into probability vectors @xcite . once again",
    "this need not generally be true , even if the map @xmath22 is invertible as linear operator . note that we are here only considering the one - point probabilities @xmath23 , which are certainly not enough to assess markovianity or non - markovianity of a process according to the mathematically precise definition used in classical probability theory .",
    "let us now recall what is the very definition of non - markovian process in the classical probabilistic setting .",
    "indeed the analysis of classical processes is a natural starting point , also adopted in @xcite .",
    "suppose we are considering a stochastic process taking values in a numerable set @xmath24 .",
    "the process is said to be markovian if the conditional transition probabilities satisfy @xmath25 with @xmath26 , so that the probability that the random variable assumes the value @xmath27 at time @xmath28 , given that it has assumed given values @xmath29 at previous times @xmath30 , actually only depends on the last assumed value , and not on previous ones . in this sense",
    "the process is said to lack memory .",
    "this statement obviously involves all @xmath0-times probabilities , so that the non - markovianity of the process can not be assessed by looking at the one - time probabilities only @xcite .",
    "it immediately appears from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mp ] ) that such a definition can not be transferred to the quantum realm , since the very notion of conditional probability does depend on the measurement performed in order to ascertain the previous value of the random variable , and on how it transforms the state for the subsequent time evolution .",
    "if we know that the process is markovian the @xmath0-point probabilities can be easily obtained in terms of the initial probability density and the conditional transition probability @xmath31 according to @xmath32 the markov condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : mp ] ) in turn implies that the conditional transition probability @xmath31 obeys the chapman - kolmogorov equation @xmath33 with @xmath34 , whose possible solutions characterize the transition probabilities of a markov process .",
    "a markov process is therefore uniquely characterized by its conditional transition probability and the initial distribution .",
    "if @xmath14 denotes the vector giving the one - point probability of a markov process taking values in a finite space , and if @xmath19 is its conditional transition probability expressed in matrix form , the probability vectors at different times are related according to @xmath35 with @xmath9 and @xmath19 a stochastic matrix obeying the chapman - kolmogorov equation , which in this case is equivalent to the requirement of p - divisibility in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdiv ] ) .",
    "however , in general validity of the chapman - kolmogorov equation and p - divisibility obviously do not coincide , since the p - divisibility does not tell anything about the higher - point conditional probabilities .",
    "indeed , for a given process one might find a matrix @xmath19 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : plp ] ) even if the process is non - markovian , however in this case the matrix is not the conditional transition probability of the process @xcite .",
    "similarly to eq .",

    "the conditional transition probability of a non - markovian process does depend on the initial probability vector @xcite .      to spell out this situation in detail",
    "let us consider an example .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that generally very little is known on non - markovian processes",

    "we consider a system having a finite set of states , which can jump from one state to the other according to certain jump probabilities @xmath38 , waiting a random time in each state before jumping to the next .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the notion of non - markovianity for the dynamics of open quantum systems , starting from the classical setting and focusing on concrete examples .",
    "while knowledge of a non - markovian classical process requires information on all the conditional probability densities , when studying the dynamics of an open system one only considers the evolution of the state , expressed by a probability vector in the classical case and a statistical operator for a quantum system .",

    "it turns out that the notion of p - divisibility , in the sense of the existence of well - defined stochastic matrices connecting probability vectors at different time points , as well as monotonic decrease in time of the kolmogorov distance among states arising from different initial conditions , are typical features of markovian processes in the classical case .",
    "the lack of these properties can thus be interpreted as signature of non - markovianity , and used to quantify it .",
    "note that due to the fact that the classical definition of non - markovianity actually involves all @xmath0-point probability densities , these signatures as expected indeed provide a different notion of non - markovianity , which only gives a sufficient condition in order to assess non - markovianity in the original sense .",
    "this behavior is shown by means of example relying on the study of certain semi - markov processes .",
    "such signatures of non - markovianity can be brought over to the quantum framework , considering the notion of cp - divisibility , corresponding to the fact that the quantum time evolution map can be arbitrary split into cpt maps corresponding to intermediate time intervals , and of the trace distance , which is the quantum version of the kolmogorov distance .",
    "these two criteria are at the basis of two recently introduced measures of non - markovianity for open quantum systems @xcite , which we here compare considering a quantum counterpart of classical semi - markov processes .",
    "moreover , analyzing both the integrodifferential and the time local form of the equations of motion , we show that one can point to possible signatures of non - markovianity to be read directly at the level of the equation , despite the fact that markovianity or non - markovianity itself is a feature of the solution . in this respect",
    "it appears that the time local form of the equations , despite isolated singularities , is certainly more convenient .",
    "more specifically , the classes of examples discussed in the paper , besides clarifying the relationship between the distinct notions of non - markovianity used for classical processes and for dynamical evolutions , allow an exact evaluation of the measure of non - markovianity introduced for quantum dynamical maps , see e.g. the remarkable result given by eq .",

    "we have discussed the different definitions of non - markovianity relevant for classical stochastic processes and dynamical evolutions .",

    "[ sec : qnm ] the original definition of non - markovianity for a classical process can not be transferred as such to the quantum realm , because of basic principles of quantum mechanics . on the one hand to make statements about the value of a certain observables at different times , a measurement scheme has to be specified , which affects the subsequent time evolution ; on the other hand the statistical operator of a quantum systems provide different , and generally incompatible , classical probability densities for different observables , as a typical feature of quantum probability with respect to classical probability @xcite . in this respect",
    "one should be satisfied with different definitions and measures of non - markovianity within the classical and the quantum framework .",
    "it is clear that physical systems can provide us with much more complicated dynamics than the one considered in this paper and the recent literature .",
