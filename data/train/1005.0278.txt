    "<S> they are relevant for interfaces containing ( or covered by ) well - separated charged interfacial groups which interact _ individually _ with ions in solution ( see figure [ correlations ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ correlations]b are behind a new experimental phenomena , namely the inversion of selectivity observed in a biological nanochannel@xcite in presence of multivalent cations . </S>",
    "<S> this biological nanochannel is the so - called ompf ionic channel found in the outer membrane of _ </S>",
    "<S> e. coli_. this is a relatively wide ionic channel in the sense that it allows the simultaneous permeation of both cations and anions ( in _ hydrated _ form ) at high rates . </S>",
    "<S> this channel is made of three identical monomerical nanopores ( see figure [ fig : snapshot ] ) , each one leaving an hourglass - shaped aqueous pore with a diameter between 1 - 4 nm surrounded by many charged titratable residues with an overall negative charge @xcite at @xmath5h=7 . in presence of monovalent electrolyte , it has a slight cationic selectivity ( i.e. the flux of cations is larger than the flux of anions across the pore ) which is well understood from basic electrostatic concepts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unexpected experimental results@xcite show that the cationic selectivity of the channel found for 1:1 electrolytes is reversed for sufficiently high concentrations of 2:1 or 3:1 electrolytes . </S>",
    "<S> the different divalent cations ( mg@xmath6 , ca@xmath6 , ba@xmath6 , ni@xmath6 ) give almost identical results , whereas trivalent cations ( la@xmath7 ) induce a substantially larger effect . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting piece of evidence is provided by x - ray@xcite data obtained from crystalls of ompf protein channels in 1 m of mgcl@xmath8 . in this structure , </S>",
    "<S> hydrated mg@xmath6 ions were found in contact with certain negatively charged residues , suggesting a strong cation - interfacial group interaction . </S>",
    "<S> all this evidence ( strong dependence on valency but small dependence on the particular cation , strong role of particular chemical groups ) suggests the existence of important ion - interfacial group correlations of electrostatic origin in this system .    in order to identify the basic physical mechanism underlying the observed selectivity inversion , we have performed all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with namd2 @xcite of the ompf channel in different electrolytes ( see fig.[fig : snapshot ] ) . in order to study the transport properties of the channel </S>",
    "<S> , we have applied an external electric field of @xmath9 mv / nm perpendicular to the lipid bilayer , which creates an electrostatic potential drop of @xmath10 mv across the membrane+channel system ( see supporting online material ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the potential drop was selected in order to be high enough to ensure ion permeation across the channel during the simulation and also because it is experimentally accessible . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be stressed that full - atomistic md simulations of transport in protein channels are extremely challenging , becoming possible only due to recent improvements in algorithms and computer power @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have conducted the first simulations of ionic transport in a protein channel in divalent electrolyte , which extraordinarily increases the need for longer simulation times and larger simulation systems , as discussed in detail in ref @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all simulation details , algorithms , processing of the data and simulation movies can be found in the online supplementary information @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .ionic fluxes ( number of ions observed to cross the ompf channel during production runs of duration @xmath11 ) and occupancy numbers ( defined as number of ions of each species inside the protein channel averaged over the simulation runs , statistical errors in the mean are estimated from @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results correspond to simulations in three different conditions : 1 m kcl , 1 m mgcl@xmath8 and a mixture of 1 m mgcl@xmath8 and 1 m kcl . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     further insight on the physical basis of this inversion phenomenon can be obtained by analyzing the effect of adding a high amount of screening monovalent salt to a situation with inverted selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the two different kinds of ionic correlations illustrated in figure [ correlations ] behave in opposite ways under the addition of high amounts of background monovalent electrolyte . </S>",
    "<S> experiments in silica nanochannels found selectivity inversion@xcite in presence of mgcl@xmath8 but the original selectivity of the channel is recovered@xcite ( no inversion ) in mixtures of multivalent electrolyte and kcl . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is in agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite based on ion - ion correlations between multivalent ions near strongly charged interfaces ( see figure [ correlations]a ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , theories predict that the short range electrostatic correlations between multivalent ions and interfacial groups ( see figure [ correlations]b ) are essentially not affected by the addition of 1:1 electrolyte . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one expects that the original selectivity is not recovered after the addition of 1:1 salt ; rather one may expect to observe a _ weakened _ inverted selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this is what we observe in our simulations of the ion channel bathed by a mixture of 1 m kcl and 1 m mgcl@xmath8 ( see table [ table : fions ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strong transversal correlations between mg@xmath6 cations and acidic groups are also observed , with a similar intensity to that observed in the previous case with only mgcl@xmath8 ( see table [ table : binding ] and the isodensity figure available as online supporting material).the observed anionic current is larger than the cationic current : the initial cationic selectivity of the channel is not recovered . </S>",
    "<S> the cationic current obtained with 1 m of mgcl@xmath8 and 1 m of kcl is _ significantly smaller _ than that obtained in presence of only 1 m of kcl . </S>",
    "<S> also , both the occupancy number and flux of cl@xmath13 observed in this case are close to the values observed in the case with only kcl , in spite of having 3 times more anions in the electrolyte solution ( see table [ table : fions ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can say that selectivity effects are weakened by the addition of 1:1 salt ( thus demonstrating their electrostatic origin ) but the inversion of selectivity has not been suppressed by adding 1:1 salt . </S>",
    "<S> this different response to added 1:1 electrolyte between our system and silica nanochannels emphasizes the different nature of the ionic correlations found in each case .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , our calculations provide a strong evidence showing the role played by electrostatic correlations in the selectivity of ionic transport in a wide biological nanochannel . in the view of recent nanotechnological applications of biological nanochannels and their engineered versions ( modified by directed mutagenesis ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is tempting to suggest that our results may have also implications in the design of responsive channels for biotechnological applications . from the point of view of biophysics , it is also interesting to note that recent electrophoretic results in phospholipid vesicles @xcite also show a complex behavior in presence of multivalent ions which is robust against addition of 1:1 electrolyte . </S>",
    "<S> all these evidences suggest that biologically relevant molecules ( lipids or proteins ) have mechanisms to preserve a strong interaction with multivalent ions even in presence of physiologically amounts of screening salt . </S>"
