    "fragment and residual nuclei production has attracted many people s interests , not only nuclear physicists but also astrophysicists and nuclear engineers .",
    "the production of intermediate mass fragments from high energy proton - nucleus reactions or nucleus - nucleus reactions has been a hot topic in nuclear physics for a decade @xcite .",
    "astrophysics and cosmic ray physics have been interested in residual nuclei production in order to calculate the production of cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial matter by solar and galactic cosmic rays .",
    "recently , nuclear engineering has needed the particle production cross sections for the development of accelerator - based systems for transmutation of radioactive nuclear waste . from the radiation safety aspect",
    ", it has also become more important to estimate the amount of radioactivity produced from various targets , as new applications of high energy proton accelerators , such as spallation neutron sources and the production of beams of unstable nuclei are being developed .    in 1997 ,",
    "the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) nuclear energy agency ( nea ) conducted benchmark calculations on activation yields to determine the predictive power of current nuclear reaction models and codes @xcite .",
    "the results calculated using many different codes which are based on a combination of different models , such as the intranuclear cascade model ( inc ) , the exciton model , the evaporation - fission model , the quantum molecular dynamics model and the statistical multifragmentation model , were compared with experimental data .",
    "it became clear that most of the computer codes did not reproduce light fragment production reactions , such as fe(p , x)@xmath4be , especially at low proton - incident energy .",
    "they considered that an adequate description of the fermi break - up model @xcite and a fragmentation model was urgently needed .",
    "the evaporation model has been very successful in describing residual nuclei production from hot nuclei . in many codes ,",
    "not only those codes that were used in the benchmark calculation by oecd / nea , but also the codes that are widely used for shielding calculations , such as the lahet code @xcite , the evaporation model is used to describe the de - excitation of thermalized nuclei . despite its success",
    ", the model has not been used to describe light fragment emission , except for a few studies concerning break - up of highly excited nuclei @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we propose a generalized evaporation model ( gevap ) for monte carlo simulation , based on the weisskopf - ewing model @xcite .",
    "nucleons and helium nuclei are the dominant particles emitted from an excited nucleus .",
    "therefore , only these particles are treated as ejectiles in the dostrovsky s evaporation models@xcite implemented in the lahet code @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some studies @xcite consider light nuclei heavier than @xmath5 particles as ejectiles since there is no reason that those particles can not be emitted from excited nuclei via evaporation process . in our generalized evaporation model , 66 nuclides up to mg",
    "are included as ejectiles , not only in their ground states but also in their excited states .",
    "besides , we use the accurate level density function for the total decay width calculation instead of an approximate form of level density function which is used in the dostrovsky s evaporation models @xcite .",
    "light fragments produced from proton - induced reactions are analyzed by the combination of the inc model implemented in the lahet code @xcite and the generalized evaporation model ( gevap ) . in order to estimate light particle production from a nucleon - nucleus reaction by the generalized evaporation model",
    ", we have to assume the ensemble of hot nuclei which are produced after the initial non - equilibrium stage .",
    "since the excitation energy , the mass , and the charge of the hot residual nuclei produced from high energy reaction are widely distributed , we can not use the simple assumption that a single excited nucleus represents the ensemble of hot thermalized nuclei .",
    "however , the inc model can provide an ensemble of residual nuclei with broad distribution in excitation energy , nuclear mass and charge .",
    "the lahet code employs the bertini intranuclear cascade model @xcite for a non - equilibrium stage of nuclear reaction , and the fermi break - up model @xcite and the evaporation model proposed by dostrovsky _",
    "@xcite for a thermalized stage .",
    "mass @xmath6 , charge @xmath7 , excitation energy @xmath8 , recoil energy , and the direction of recoil motion are extracted from the inc calculation done by the lahet code .",
    "then the de - excitation process of the hot nucleus with these quantities are calculated by gevap , instead of by the fermi break - up model and the evaporation model employed in the lahet code . in the following , we call this calculation procedure ` inc / gevap ' .",
    "we focus mainly on @xmath4be produced by proton - induced reactions in the energy range from 10 mev to 3 gev , because @xmath4be is the most intensively measured light fragment produced from various targets , and many experimental data are available for comparison .",
    "we compare the inc / gevap results with experimental data as well as the results calculated by using lahet , to make the effect of using different de - excitation models clear .",
