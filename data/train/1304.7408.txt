    "m51 ( ngc  5194 ) , the ` whirlpool galaxy ' , is a nearby grand - design spiral galaxy viewed almost face - on ( table  [ properties ] ) , with two prominent spiral arms that can be traced close to the nuclear region , and is undergoing an interaction with a small companion , ngc  5195 , 4.5 to the north - east . with its large angular size and strong spiral structure is well studied across a broad range of wavebands from x - ray to radio , and has been the subject of numerous studies investigating the origin of grand design spiral structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the relationship between spiral arms and star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is a seyfert 2 @xcite and hosts a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) surrounded by a @xmath0100pc disk of warm dense gas @xcite .",
    "the two prominent spiral arms in , presumed to be caused via tidal interaction with the companion , are rich in molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with molecular gas dominant over atomic gas until the outskirts of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "molecular clouds provide the fuel for star formation , and in nearby galactic disks knowledge of the distribution of molecular hydrogen gas is a crucial tool for investigating star formation and spiral structure .",
    "since molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect directly , as it lacks a permanent dipole moment , carbon monoxide ( co ) , observable at ( sub)millimetre ( submm ) wavelengths , is widely used as a tracer of molecular hydrogen gas both in molecular clouds in the milky way and in external galaxies . at a distance of 8.2mpc (",
    "* corresponds to @xmath3  pc ) and an inclination @xmath4 @xcite , the proximity and face - on nature of makes it possible to use single - dish ( sub)mm telescopes to study spiral arm structures and sub - structures at spatial resolutions of a few hundred parsecs . at this spatial resolution",
    "we are not sensitive to individual molecular clouds but rather clumps of molecular clouds , or giant molecular associations ( gmas ) , as well as diffuse gas .",
    "the spiral arms of contain numerous gmas ( as many as 16 are noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* )    since stars form not from the diffuse envelopes of molecular clouds but from their dense molecular cores , tracing the warm dense gas is important for our understanding of star formation .",
    "the @xmath2=3 - 2 transition of co ( the @xmath2=3 level is 33k above ground state ) is a tracer of this warm , dense gas , while the lower critical density transition ( the @xmath2=1 level is 5.5 k above ground state ) is sensitive to the majority of gas in the cold ism , including , for example , more diffuse gas .",
    "in fact , many authors have shown that the and lines can not be tracing exactly the same components of molecular gas , and , importantly , that is the better tracer of warm dense gas ( and hence star forming potential ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    although has been mapped in low-@xmath2 rotational @xmath5co and @xmath6co transitions in a number of single - dish and interferometric studies , until now complete mapped observations of the full disk of in the higher energy level transition line have been lacking , in particular because of the need for good telescope sites for higher frequency observations .",
    "single - dish maps of the and transitions were presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( using the iram 30 m and nobeyama telescopes ) , and aperture synthesis maps have been presented by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies have indicated that co is mainly confined to the spiral arms .",
    "other authors have studied tracers such as co , ci , and cii in the central region or at individual positions in the spiral arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations to date have been restricted to the central regions and inner spiral arms of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have also had a relatively coarse angular resolution .",
    "aperture synthesis mapping of the central region has also been carried out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but aperture synthesis maps are known to resolve out and miss both a significant proportion of the co flux and any extended emission .",
    "single - dish observations of the full disk of are thus essential for determining the true distribution of molecular gas including any diffuse emission in the inter - arm regions , and thus its relation to star formation and the total reservoir of star - forming gas .    as well as understanding the distribution of molecular gas as a function of the spiral structure , it is also important to understand the relationship across multiple wavebands , from observations of the stellar component through to the dust and atomic gas components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "previous studies have suggested that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in the mid - infrared is a tracer of dust and gas in the cool ism .",
    "for example , @xcite found that within nearby galaxies pah emission is correlated with co line emission , and several studies using _ spitzer _ data have found that pah emission is correlated with cool ( @xmath020  k ) dust emission in nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , using harp observations of the spiral galaxy ngc  2403 , @xcite found the scale length of the radial profile to be statistically identical to the scale length of the continuum - subtracted 8 ( pah ) emission but found no correlation on sub - kpc scales .",
    "in this paper we present the first complete map of covering the entire optical galaxy disk over an area of @xmath010@xmath17 ( @xmath024@xmath117kpc ) at a spatial resolution of @xmath0600pc .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : obs - data ] we describe our harp - b observations , the data reduction and processing of the harp - b data , and our treatment of ancillary data we took from the literature .",
    "sections  [ sec : images][sec : spiral ] present our results . in section  [ sec : images ] we present the harp - b map , describe the distribution of the emission in a qualitative way , and compare our map to maps of other tracers of molecular gas ( , ) , atomic gas ( ) , star formation ( , 24 ) and pah 8 emission using data available in the literature .",
    "we also investigate the contamination of submm continuum emission by in - band line emission . in section  [ sec : geometry ]",
    "we discuss how the appearance of s bright molecular gas rich spiral arms varies for different projected orientations and in section  [ sec : coratio ] we disucss maps of the co line ratio . in section  [ sec : spiral ]",
    "we examine and discuss the distribution and properties of the emission as a function of the distance along the spiral arms and inter - arm regions , and compare this to the distribution seen for other wave bands .",

    "the mean value in each interval is used ; this is the central value in each radial interval , except for r@xmath71.7kpc where the mean radius is 1.1kpc and r@xmath86.7kpc where the mean radius os 7.6kpc ; columns 2 , 3 and 4 : parameters of the linear fits to equation  [ eq : rel ] ) . [",
    "tab : rel ]    in section  [ sec : coratio ] we noted an apparent trend for in the inter - arm regions to increase with radius . from inspection of figure  [ fig : coratio - ico ] ( lower middle panel ) we can now see clearer evidence of this . here , for a given co intensity",
    "high values of the ratio always occur at higher radii .",
    "this is in contrast to the behaviour seen in the spiral arms ( lower left panel of  figure  [ fig : coratio - ico ] ) , where larger radii exhibit higher ratios for lower co intensities than small radii , and likewise smaller radii exhibit low ratios for higher co intensities than large radii .",
    "these trends can be explained as follows .",
    "the general dropoff in all co ratios with radius , for both spiral arms and inter - arm regions , is likely explained by the decreasing beam - averaged molecular gas column density with radius . for the spiral arms , which contain star - forming regions ,",
    "high ratio values reflect high gas densities and/or temperatures .",
    "the trend with radius suggests that active star - formation sites occur at lower co intensities at larger radii , which may reflect an underlying star formation threshold ( e.g. the toomre q parameter ; * ? ? ?",
    "one would not expect the same trend in the inter - arm regions since they contain little or no active star formation ( see figure  [ fig : spiral ] , which shows that with the exception of inter - arm ii to the north - east at large radii there are no significant regions of star formation that are not included within our spiral arm mask ) .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for the apparent trend with radius in the inter - arm regions .",
    "one possibility is that the temperature and/or density is increasing with radius , but this does not seem likely in the inter - arm regions .",
    "another possibility is that the inter - arm medium consists of a diffuse molecular medium ( dominating the lowest emission lines most ) in which dense clouds are embedded .",
    "loss of the diffuse medium at large radii would result in the observed behaviour .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the co begins to become optically thin at large radii . under typical excitation conditions all low co lines are optically thick , and if the density and temperature are high enough will have higher optial depth than the lower lines .",
    "thus , if cloud column densities in the inter - arm region decrease with radius , may become optically thin while remains optically thick , hence producing the observevd trend .",
    "variation of the co ratio with co surface density suggests a relation to star formation and local heating .",
    "variation with radius , on the other hand , suggests a relation to a more diffuse component in the disk .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig : coratio - ico ] clearly suggests that the line emission is also tracing a more diffuse and radius - dependent component of molecular gas than the higher co transitions .    while it is clear that the variation of co ratio with co surface density is dependent on galactocentric distance , the important result from this plot is that a simple relationship between the co ratio and the integrated intensity can not be used to scale the -derived @xmath9-factor for use in determining molecular gas surface density from the line without talking into account the spatial location of the emission in the galaxy",
    " the variation in the relationship implies that applying a global scaling for sub - kiloparsec scales will overestimate the molecular gas surface density at large galactocentric radii and underestimate it at small radii .     in both co transitions ) .",
    "we colour - code the plotted points according to galactocentric radius at smaller radial intervals than for figure  [ fig : coratio - ico ] ; here we show the central emission with r@xmath71.7kpc and 1 kpc intervals thereafter .",
    "the solid lines show bi - variate least squares fits , whose parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the dashed lines show the radius - dependent relationship given by equation  [ eq : rel ] using the mean distance of pixels in each radial bin .",
    ", width=302 ]    , for all pixels detected above 3@xmath10 .",
    "points are colour - coded as in figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - fit ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    in figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - fit ] we investigate the radial dependence of the relationship between co ratio and intensity , by plotting the data at radial intervals of @xmath01kpc and fitting a bi - variate linear function for each bin ( shown as solid lines in figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - fit ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the linear fits are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "we find that the pearson s correlation coefficient decreases considerably with galactocentric radius , from 0.95 in the centre to 0.5 at @xmath07kpc .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - fit ] show radius dependent relations given by a linear function of the co ratio with both intensity and galactocentric radius such that @xmath11 for the parameters given in table  [ tab : rel ] .",
    "we find that a relationship with a slope of 0.6 reasonably describes the emission between radii of 1.7 and 5.7  kpc , but that different relationships are needed to describe both the central regions ( shallower slope ) and regions at radii larger than @xmath06  kpc ( steeper slope ) .",
    "nonetheless , a global fit across all radii yields a slope of 0.6 , which is comparable to the value found by @xcite for ngc  2403 .",
    "the relationship between the co ratio and equation  [ eq : rel ] for individual pixels is shown in figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - rel ] .",
    "the scatter in the relationship clearly increases with radius , as indicated by the decreasing correlation coefficient ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the relationships between pahs , cold dust , molecular gas and atomic gas emission in with those in other late - type galaxies , and in particular whether pah emission is a tracer of gas and dust in the cool ism .",
    "a good target for a simple comparison is the nearby ( @xmath03  mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sabcd spiral galaxy ngc2403 , whose relationships between these properties were studied by @xcite . while previous authors have found that pah emission in nearby galaxies is strongly correlated with cold dust emission ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found a correlation between pah emission and co line emission in nearby galaxies , @xcite find that , in ngc2403 , the and pah surface brightnesses are uncorrelated on sub - kpc scales .    for both and ngc2403 , as for many late - type spiral galaxies , the strongest regions of star formation",
    "are located outside the centre of the galaxy .",
    "qualitatively , the structures seen in the , pah , 24 and images for and ngc2403 are similar . exceptions for are the inner part of arm ii , the south - west where co emission is seen to trace the spiral arm but relatively little pah emission is seen , and the very centre where there is a dip in the pah emission but not co ( the latter difference , however , may be due to the different spatial resolutions ) .",
    "conversely , an exception for ngc2403 is a hole in the co emission at the galaxy centre that is not seen in pah emission @xcite .",
    "+   +      +      following @xcite we used the integrated intensity and surface brightness images presented in figures  [ fig : maps - ico32 ] and  [ fig : maps - other ] to produce a map and radial profile of the / emission ratio ( left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : maps - ratio ] and the top panel of figure  [ fig : profiles - ratio ] , respectively ) .",
    "the two input images are in units of and mjysr@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "as before , only pixels detected above 3@xmath10 in the input images are shown .",
    "the / ratio ranges from 0.04 to 3.5 across , with a median value of 0.8 and standard deviation of 14.1 .",
    "the / ratio appears to broadly follow the spiral structure , with the highest values in the spiral arms and the lowest values in the inter - arm regions .    in the spiral arms we find a mean / ratio of unity , and values of @xmath00.7 in the inter - arm regions .",
    "the ratio appears to decrease with radius for the spiral arms , falling by a factor of about two between @xmath02 and 6  kpc .",
    "there appears to be no obvious overall trend with radius for the inter - arm regions , but we note , however , that the presence of strong features in the inter - arm profile at @xmath04 and @xmath06  kpc , which are similar to features in the spiral arms , suggests that the spiral arms traced in emission may be broader than for co emission .",
    "it is clear that the variation of the ratio of to emission in is very different to the profile that was found for ngc2403 by @xcite , who showed that in that galaxy the ratio increases with radius but decreases sharply in the central region ; ngc2403 typically has lower ratio values than found for .",
    "it seems likely that the and properties for are very different from those for ngc2403 . while @xcite showed that , for ngc2403 , the and emission does not trace the same structures on small spatial scales , in the present work for we find that the and emission _ do _ trace the same structures on sub - kiloparsec scales , as is also clear from simple visual inspection of figures  [ fig : maps - other][fig : maps - polar - other ] .",
    "the most striking feature is that the highest values of the / ratio are located @xmath01.52  kpc to the south - west , in arm i ( see figure  [ fig : maps - ratio ] ) . here ,",
    "ratio values are up to a factor of two higher than typically seen elsewhere in the spiral arms . from inspection of figure",
    "[ fig : maps - other ] , it is evident that this region of enhanced -to- emission corresponds to a region of reduced and 24 surface brightness . here",
    ", there are no strong features apparent in the image , but an integral field spectroscopy study of nebular emission lines in the central regions by @xcite does show an emission feature at this location after extinction correction and subtraction of a contribution from diffuse ionised gas .",
    "this is also just south along the spiral arm from the location where we have noted the highest and arm / inter - arm contrast ( section  [ sec : images ] ) .",
    "conversely , two obvious regions of low / ratio occur at symmetrically opposite locations @xmath06  kpc to the north - east ( arm i ) and south - west ( arm ii ) that are coincident with the locations of bright peaks in the , 24 and images that are not peaks in co.    in the top panel of figure  [ fig : co32-pah - spiral ] we plot the relationship between and surface brightness , colour - coded for different radial intervals as in previous figures .",
    "we find a strong correlation , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 and the best - fitting bi - variate least squares relation is described by @xmath13 .",
    "the largest scatter arises at the largest radii , both from the outermost parts of the galaxy disk and from inter - arm region ii at large radii .",
    "the extreme outliers correspond to pixels in the outer - most regions of the disk .",
    "the remainder of the scatter appears to arise from a more subtle dependence of the relationship on radius .",
    "we examine this further in figure  [ fig : co32-pah - fit ] by fitting separate linear relationships to different radial intervals , whose parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "we find strong correlations ( pearson s correlation coefficients of 0.80.9 ) in every radial interval with the exception of the largest radii ( 0.45 at r@xmath86.7  kpc ) .",
    "we note that the extreme outliers in the r@xmath86.7  kpc radial bin correspond to pixels in the outer - most regions of the disk .    with the exception of the innermost bin , @xmath14 , the slope of the relationship increases with increasing radius .",
    "the steep innermost bin corresponds to the region of the nuclear disk which is rich in molecular gas and exhibits high / ratios over most of the region , as seen in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : maps - ratio ] .",
    "the outliers below the fitted relation in this bin ( red points ) correspond to the region of highest / ratios ( and also the region of highest co arm - interarm contrast ) described above .    the results in the present work support the idea that pah emission is a good tracer of molecular gas , and that , for at least , the correlation between and emission holds on sub - kpc scales and across different physical regions ( whether in the nuclear region , spiral arms or inter - arm regions ) in the galaxy .",
    "with the exception of one region of enhanced / ratio , the dependence of the relationship appears to be one of galactocentric radius .",
    "one explanation for the relationship between and emission could be if the formation of molecular clouds occurs in regions with stellar potential wells @xcite .",
    "the co emission then arises from the new molecular clouds and the increase in stellar emission in the potential wells heats the diffuse ism , with enhanced pah emission occurring in the regions where the strength of the interstellar radiation field is increased ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case in , then the strong correlation between pah and co emission on sub - kiloparsec scales suggests that the two processes are occurring in physically similar locations .",
    "further evidence of this is the similar behaviour of with 24 emission , shown in the centre panels of figures  [ fig : maps - ratio ] and  [ fig : profiles - ratio ] .",
    "the relationship between and 24 emission ( lower panel of figure  [ fig : co32-pah - spiral ] , again colour coded for different radial intervals ) is described by the best - fitting bi - variate least squares relation @xmath15 with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 . the relationship appears to vary with radius in a very similar way to that seen for emission .",
    "again , the extreme outliers in the r@xmath86.7  kpc radial bin correspond to pixels in the outer - most regions of the disk .",
    "an explanation of the decrease of both the / and 24/ ratios with radius would be if the pahs are excited not only by uv photons ( from massive star - forming regions and hence traced by and 24 emission ) but also by softer optical photons which become relatively more important in the outer regions of the galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    ) .",
    "we colour - code the plotted points according to galactocentric radius as for figure  [ fig : coratio - ico - fit ] .",
    "the solid lines show bi - variate least squares fits , whose parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    ", width=302 ]      previous authors have found that pah emission does not trace star formation on sub - kiloparsec scales . we investigate this for the case of via the relationship between and 24 surface density .",
    "it is thought that pahs originate in the outflows of carbon - rich agb stars and their descendants or in interstellar shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "24 emission traces recent dust enshrouded star formation , though may also include a component of diffuse emission that is not associated with recent star formation .",
    "we examine the relationship between and 24 emission in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : maps - ratio ] and the lower panel of figure  [ fig : profiles - ratio ] , which respectively show a map of the ratio of to 24 surface density ( using images that both have units of mjy  sr@xmath12 ) and the radial profile of this ratio .",
    "the median ratio is 0.78 , with a standard deviation of 0.28 , and values for individual pixels range from @xmath70.1 to 1.8 .",
    "there are several things that are immediately striking .",
    "first , the surface density of emission dominates over 24 emission ( i.e. to 24 surface density ratios greater than unity ) in the two outer spiral arms and in regions of prominent spurs bridging the two spiral arms . elsewhere in the spiral arms",
    "there are are few pixels with values of about unity , but none within the central @xmath02  kpc .",
    "second , apart from the two outer arms , regions dominant in emission appear to be concentrated to the south of the galaxy , away from the companion .",
    "third , 24 surface density is larger than the surface density of emission at the locations of all the bright 24 peaks , but there are nonetheless some 24 peaks at whose locations surface density appears to be dominate .",
    "it is also clear that the ratio of emission to 24 emission increases with radius ( lower panel of figure  [ fig : profiles - ratio ] ) , which is contrary to the findings of @xcite for ngc2403 .",
    "lastly , it is also striking that the variation of this ratio as a function of distance along the spiral arms and interarms is most similar to the radial profile of the emission ( see figure  [ fig : spiral - profile ] ) .",
    "we have presented a new molecular line map of the nearby grand - design spiral galaxy obtained with harp - b on the jcmt .",
    "this map , covering an area of @xmath014@xmath110kpc and having a spatial resolution of @xmath0600pc , is the first co map in the transition to cover the full extent of the disk in .",
    "we have used the map together with and data and other data from the literature to investigate the molecular gas properties of as a function of distance along the spiral arms , adopting a simple approach for defining the spiral structure .",
    "we have found the following results :    * we detect emission over an area of @xmath021@xmath114kpc , across the entire disk of out to its companion ngc  5195 .",
    "the distribution of emission follows a clear two - armed spiral structure with broad ( @xmath01kpc ) arms , and is in close agreement with the distribution of emission .",
    "we detect inter - arm emission everywhere within a central area of @xmath014@xmath110kpc , as well as several spurs , or bridges , of co emission connecting the spiral arms . *",
    "we find that the contamination of submm continuum by in - band emission ranges from up to 20% in the spiral arms to @xmath710% in the inter - arm regions .",
    "* by projecting the co integrated intensity maps of to various edge - on orientations , we have shown that the major axis profile of a galaxy with bright molecular gas rich spiral arms can mimic a molecular ring for some viewing angles .",
    "* for the  and transitions there is a clear difference between the variation of arm and inter - arm emission with galactocentric radius , with the spiral arm emission decreasing with radius and the inter - arm emission relatively constant with radius .",
    "conversely , for line and emission the arm and inter - arm regions appears to follow a similar trend with radius .",
    "* the contrast between spiral arm and inter - arm intensity decreases with galactocentric radius , falling by a factor of @xmath03 over two kiloparsecs , there is a similar but less pronounced trend for line emission , but for and emission the arm ",
    "inter - arm contrast appears relatively constant with radius .",
    "* at this spatial resolution , the co  / line ratio varies from @xmath00.11.0 , with average values of 0.5 over the whole disk , 0.5 in the spiral arms , and 0.6 in the central @xmath01 . in the inter - arm regions , values range from 0.20.6 .",
    "* there is no clear evidence that the co line ratios vary as a function of distance along the spiral arms , but there does appear to be a trend for co line ratios in the inter - arm regions to increase with radius . * we find a strong relationship between the integrated intensity and the surface brightness .",
    "the ratio of to emission decreases with radius , and we find a strong relationship between this ratio and the intensity that varies with galactocentric radius . * a similar but slightly steeper relationship is found between and 24 surface brightness , with the ratio of to 24 surface brightness increasing with radius .",

    "<S> we present the first complete map of the nearby grand - design spiral galaxy ( ngc  5194 ) , at a spatial resolution of @xmath0600pc , obtained with the harp - b instrument on the james clerk maxwell telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the map covers the entire optical galaxy disk and out to the companion ngc  5195 , with emission detected over an area of @xmath09@xmath16 ( @xmath021@xmath114kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the integrated intensity map and combine our results with maps of , and other data from the literature to investigate the variation of the molecular gas , atomic gas and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) properties of as a function of distance along the spiral structure on sub - kiloparsec scales . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the  and transitions there is a clear difference between the variation of arm and inter - arm emission with galactocentric radius , with the inter - arm emission relatively constant with radius and the contrast between arm and inter - arm emission decreasing with radius . for line and emission </S>",
    "<S> the variation with radius shows a similar trend for the arm and inter - arm regions , and the arm  </S>",
    "<S> inter - arm contrast appears relatively constant with radius . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the variation of co line ratios ( @xmath2=3 - 2/2 - 1 , @xmath2=2 - 1/1 - 0 and @xmath2=3 - 2/1 - 0 ) as a function of distance along the spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> line ratios are consistent with the range of typical values for other nearby galaxies in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the highest co  / line ratios are found in the central @xmath01kiloparsec and in the spiral arms and the lowest line ratios in the inter - arm regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find no clear evidence of a trend with radius for the spiral arms but for the inter - arm regions there appears to be a trend for all co line ratios to increase with radius . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong relationship between the ratio of intensity to stellar continuum - subtracted 8 pah surface brightness and the intensity that appears to vary with radius .    </S>",
