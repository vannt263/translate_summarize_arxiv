    "semiconductor nanocrystals ( ncs ) ( refs .  ) are nano - sized crystalline particles with numbers of atoms of the order of @xmath3-@xmath4 . ncs with controlled and tunable sizes as well as good optical properties are fabricated in a colloidal growth process.@xcite this makes them excellent candidates for use in low - cost optoelectronic applications , including solar cells , biomarkers,@xcite light emitting diodes,@xcite photodetectors,@xcite single - photon sources in quantum cryptography,@xcite or lasers.@xcite in particular , it has been recently demonstrated that the optical gain in ncs can be blocked , created , and tuned by engineering the nc confinement@xcite or the type of multiexciton complex active in the stimulated emission process.@xcite    the ncs are considered as a promising material for the optically active media in solar cells .",
    "they offer a potential way to increase the efficiency of solar cells due to their tunable parameters amenable to optimization,@xcite as well as by generation of multi - exciton complexes ( meg ) following absorption of a single high - energy photon.@xcite during meg a high - energy photon with energy of at least twice the semiconductor bandgap , @xmath5 , is absorbed creating an excited state , which can be described as a superposition of configurations with one and more electron - hole pairs.@xcite alternatively , we can think of exciting a single exciton , which is then converted via coulomb interactions into additional interacting electron - hole pairs .",
    "energy relaxation of these multi - exciton complexes results in multiple carriers at the bottom of the conduction and the top of the valence bands .",
    "these multi - exciton states decay into exciton states by auger processes , limiting the number of additional charges generated in the meg process .",
    "the process of conversion of a single exciton into multiple electron - hole pairs competes with the phonon - assisted relaxation of exciton energy.@xcite since the original report by schaller and klimov,@xcite the meg process has been reported in pbse , pbs , pbte , cdse , inas , and si ncs,@xcite with efficiency reaching 700% ( seven electron - hole pairs out of one photon).@xcite however , proper assessment of the meg efficiency in these experiments is nontrivial.@xcite the potential explanation of meg has been given by shabaev , efros , and nozik@xcite and alternative interpretation proposed by zunger and co - workers@xcite and others.@xcite    the lowest - energy meg process involves conversion of an excited exciton into a low - energy bi - exciton following absorption of a photon with energy of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of the electronic and optical properties of the bi - exciton is needed . to date",
    ", theoretical attention has been focused mainly on the properties of low - energy exciton states , with the cdse ncs being the most studied system .",
    "the electronic and optical properties of an exciton ( x ) confined in a nc have been explored utilizing the multi - band @xmath7 method,@xcite , tight - binding@xcite and empirical pseudopotential methods.@xcite these studies show a fine structure in the low - energy states of x originating from the electron - hole exchange , with the energy gap between the lowest - dark , and the higher - bright states of the order of several mev .",
    "identification of bi - exciton ( xx ) signatures in emission spectra is complicated by the presence of the inhomogeneous broadening in the ensemble measurements on ncs .",
    "however , one can measure consistently the xx binding energies both in ensemble measurements in cdse@xcite and cds ncs.@xcite first single - nc experiments have also been reported.@xcite in particular , the exciton fine structure has been studied in individual ncs as a function of the magnetic field.@xcite thus , the state of experimental techniques is approaching that in epitaxially grown quantum dots , for which single - dot experiments , revealing details of the fine structure of multiexciton complexes , are now a standard.@xcite one of experimental tools utilized to obtain spectroscopic information about bi - excitons confined in ncs , the transient absorption , involves measuring with a short probe pulse the change of absorption induced by the pump laser pulse.@xcite by utilizing the transient absorption technique one can probe states of xx via both emissive and absorptive experiments , which opens a possibility of probing the fine structure of xx directly.@xcite the experimental results of ref .   obtained on cdse dots with the diameter of @xmath8 nm have been compared to the results of empirical pseudopotential calculations carried out on dots with diameter of @xmath9 and @xmath10 nm . however",
    ", to our knowledge , no systematic study of the dependence of the bi - exciton spectra on the parameters of the cdse ncs have been carried out.@xcite the quantitative analysis of these systems is computationally challenging due to the nc size .",
    "with @xmath11 electrons , ncs are too large for _ ab initio _ methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 methods are not accurate enough to capture important atomistic details , such as the asymmetry of the crystal lattice or the surface effects .",
    "this necessitates the use of the semi - empirical atomistic methods in the theoretical analysis .",
    "here we utilize the atomistic tight - binding approach to perform a systematic study of the electronic and optical properties of an x and xx confined in a single cdse nc as a function of nc size .",
    "we illustrate our calculations on a spherical nc with the diameter of @xmath9 nm for comparison with the empirical pseudopotential of ref .  .",
    "to this end we utilize the qnano computational platform.@xcite the atomistic single particle states are used in computation of the coulomb matrix elements , describing the carrier - carrier interactions , and the optical dipole elements .",
    "the many - body multi - exciton states are computed using exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "the results show the @xmath1 and @xmath2 shells in the low - energy electron spectrum as expected from a single - band effective mass theory . for holes",
    "we find a complex spectrum , consisting of a band of four kramers doublets forming a quasi - degenerate hole shell separated from the remaining hole levels by a gap .",
    "the energy separation of these states is much smaller than the characteristic coulomb hole - hole interaction matrix elements .",
    "therefore we predict the bi - exciton ( xx ) spectrum to be composed of a manifold of closely lying correlated states of two electrons residing mainly on the @xmath1-shell and a correlated complex of two holes occupying almost degenerate hole states , resulting in a fine structure of bi - exciton optical spectra .",
    "the exciton ( x ) spectrum , on the other hand , reveals the fine structure determined both by the hole shell degeneracy and the electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "we find that the correlated character of both the x and xx systems makes the computations challenging , with large basis sizes necessary to obtain converged values of their energies . in this work",
    "we discuss how this fine structure influences the absorption and emission spectra of both x and xx complexes .",
    "we find that for small ncs ( with diameter below @xmath12 nm ) the bi - exciton is unbound , whilst for larger ncs it is bound .",
    "also , the order of x and xx emission peaks with model inhomogeneous broadening depends on temperature .",
    "we show that due to details of the electronic structure and assignment of oscillator strengths , the thermal population of excited xx states leads to a shift of the inhomogeneously broadened xx peak to lower energies , whilst the analogous process leads to the increase of the x emission energy .",
    "the shifts are of the order of tens of mev and may lead to the reversal of the order of emission peaks .",
    "we analyze the electronic and optical properties of electrons and holes confined in a single , spherical cdse nanocrystal .",
    "the calculations are carried out utilizing the qnano computational platform and consist of the following steps : ( i ) the definition of the geometry and composition of the nanostructure on the atomistic level , ( ii ) the calculation of single - particle quasi - electron and quasi - hole states using the 20-band @xmath0 tight - binding ( tb ) model , ( iii ) the computation of many - body energies and states of @xmath13 quasi - electron - quasi - hole pairs in the configuration - interaction ( ci ) approach ( in this case @xmath14 and 2 ) , and ( iv ) calculation of emission and absorption spectra using fermi s golden rule .",
    "a detailed review of the qnano package and the computational procedure is given in ref .  .",
    "the computational procedure starts with a definition of the positions of all atoms present in the system .",
    "the underlying crystal lattice of the cdse nanocrystal is taken to be in wurtzite modification , which is built out of two hexagonal closely packed ( hcp ) sublattices , one made up of cations and another of anions , shifted with respect to one another . as a result , each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbors .",
    "the hcp structure is described by two lattice parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which , in principle , are independent . in this work",
    "we assume however that the nearest neighbors of each atom form a perfect tetrahedron .",
    "this relates the two lattice parameters with one another such that we have @xmath17 . with @xmath18 nm ( ref . ) , this gives @xmath19 nm , as compared to the experimental value of @xmath20 nm . if one parametrizes all the distances with the lattice constant @xmath16 , the positions of the four atoms in the wurtzite unit cell are as follows : we have two anions , in our case selenium , at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and two cations , in our case cadmium , at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "calculation of the single - particle states is carried out in the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) approximation , in which the carrier wave function is written as a linear combination @xmath25 of atomistic orbitals of type @xmath26 localized on the atom @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the total number of atoms in the system . in our @xmath0 model",
    "we deal with 10 doubly spin - degenerate basis orbitals on each atom .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 determining the @xmath30th single - particle state as well as the corresponding single - particle energies are found by diagonalizing the semi - empirical atomistic tb hamiltonian @xmath31 in which the operator @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) creates ( annihilates ) the particle on the orbital @xmath34 of atom @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian is parametrized by the on - site orbital energies @xmath35 , spin - orbit coupling constants @xmath36 , and hopping matrix elements @xmath37 connecting different orbitals located at neighboring atoms .",
    "in our model we use the nearest neighbor approximation , and therefore do not capture directly the crystal field splitting , which is due to the symmetry breaking on the level of third nearest neighbors . following ref .",
    "we include the crystal field splitting in an approximate manner by detuning the energy of the orbital @xmath38 from that of the orbitals @xmath39 , @xmath40 which remain degenerate .",
    "the tb parameters are obtained by calculating the band structure of bulk cdse and fitting the band edges and effective masses at high symmetry points of the brillouin zone to the values obtained experimentally or by _ ab initio _ calculations .",

    "[ fig4](a ) we plot the joint optical density of states ( jdos ) , i.e. , magnitude of dipole elements @xmath140 versus the energy gap between the ground electron ( @xmath141 ) and the four lowest hole states . for polarizations @xmath124 and @xmath128",
    "we obtain four nonzero elements , while for polarization @xmath129 the jdos consists of only two peaks .",
    "this structure of jdos can be understood by approximating the atomistic wave functions as products of the envelope and bloch part , as is done in the @xmath7 model .",
    "since the envelope function changes slowly on interatomic distances , one typically approximates the dipole element by a product of the overlap of electron and hole envelope functions and an integral involving the bloch components and the position operator appropriate for the @xmath124 , @xmath128 , or @xmath129 polarization .",
    "the electron ground state is built out of @xmath1-type atomistic orbitals modulated by an @xmath1-type envelope , while the hole states are built out of @xmath2-type atomistic orbitals . due to the spin - orbit mixing the envelope functions of the hole are mixtures of different symmetries.@xcite however",
    ", this projectional analysis will extract the part of the envelope function of the hole which is of the same symmetry as the electron envelope function ( in this case , symmetry @xmath1 ) .    using this approximation",

    "they are present in the @xmath124 and @xmath128 polarizations , but absent in the @xmath129 polarization .",
    "this means that the @xmath1-like term in the hole envelope function is associated with the bloch functions consisting of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but not @xmath38 atomic orbitals .",
    "the overlap of the electron and hole envelope functions is large for h1 , but very small for h4 , which indicates that the @xmath1-like component dominates in the envelope function of the hole ground state , while the state h4 is of a different symmetry .",
    "the two middle jdos peaks , h2 and h3 , appear in all polarizations , indicating that the bloch components of the corresponding hole functions are combinations of all three atomistic @xmath2 orbitals . of those two , h2 is consistently stronger than h3 , which suggests that the hole state h2 has a larger , and h3 - a smaller @xmath1-like component .",
    "further confirmation of this assignment of symmetries is obtained by computing the dipole matrix elements between the @xmath2 electron states and the four hole states .",

    "we find that the ground state h1 gives a negligible dipole matrix element with either of the three electron @xmath2 states , which confirms that the state h1 is of the @xmath1 type . on the other hand",
    ", the state h4 presents large dipole elements , which indicates that it has a dominating @xmath2-like component in its envelope function .    as previously with the @xmath1-type electron state , the two middle peaks , h2 and h3 , appear consistently in both polarizations , but now h3 is larger .",
    "we conclude that the hole states h2 and h3 are mixtures of @xmath1 and @xmath2-type envelopes .",
    "this assignment of symmetries is only approximate , as the details of the underlying crystal lattice and surface roughness break the rotational symmetry of the nanocrystal .",
    "however , a visual inspection of charge densities of the hole states suggests a picture consistent with the above analysis .",
    "note that all single - particle states are kramers doublets , whose degeneracy is due to the time - reversal symmetry of the single - particle hamiltonian . in what follows",
    "we shall distinguish the states forming the doublet by arrows up and down , respectively . due to the spin - orbit interaction these labels",
    "can not be identified with particle spins , but rather with bloch total angular momenta .",
    "in order to find the energies and states of the exciton ( x ) we generate all possible electron - hole configurations in the single - particle basis , write the full hamiltonian ( [ interacting_hamiltonian ] ) in a matrix form in the basis of these configurations , and diagonalize this matrix numerically .",
    "construction of the hamiltonian requires knowledge of the coulomb electron - hole scattering matrix elements .",
    "typically one distinguishes two types of coulomb matrix elements : the `` direct '' and the `` exchange '' ones , the latter originating from the antisymmetric character of the many - body wave function .",
    "this distinction is particularly clear in the case of diagonal matrix elements , i.e. , those arising when one computes the expectation value of the coulomb operator against any configuration . in this case",
    "the direct terms can involve pairs of particles with different spin , while the exchange elements connect particles with the same spins . due to the spin - orbit interaction present in our tb model",
    "the single - particle states can not be characterized by a definite spin . moreover , as already mentioned , all single - particle states are in reality kramers doublets , and any linear combination of the two constituent states is also a good eigenstate of the tb hamiltonian . in order to be able to separate and analyze the coulomb elements , we perform a rotation of each pair of states forming the kramers doublet so as to optimize the expectation value of the pauli @xmath142 operator . with the states",
    "thus prepared we compute the coulomb elements using the formulas ( [ coulomb_elements ] ) .",
    "let us now comment on the magnitudes of various coulomb matrix elements for our nc with diameter of @xmath9 nm .",
    "we will discuss these elements in two cases , depending on the treatment of the nearest - neighbor contributions : ( i ) the case when these contributions are computed exactly using slater orbitals , as shown in formula ( [ coulomb_nn_slater ] ) , ( ii ) the case when they are expressed simply by the formula ( [ coulomb_remote ] ) as for remote centers . in each case",
    "we scale the nearest neighbor contribution by the dielectric constant of @xmath143 , i.e. , half of the cdse bulk value .",
    "if we denote the states composing the lowest - energy electron doublet as @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and the analogous pair of hole states as @xmath146 and @xmath147 , we find the direct elements : @xmath148 mev in the case ( i ) , and @xmath149 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "these elements define the interaction energy of an electron - hole configuration @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , where @xmath152 denotes quasi - particle vacuum .",
    "the `` spin - flip '' electron scattering , described , e.g. , by an element @xmath153 , is not possible , as the value of this element is negligibly small .",
    "however , due to the much stronger spin mixing of the hole states resulting from the spin - orbit interaction one might expect that the transitions involving the hole spin flip should be possible .",
    "in fact , here the only elements of note are @xmath154 mev in the case ( i ) , and @xmath155 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "the scattering among the hole states , with the electron staying on the same level and without hole spin flip , @xmath156 and @xmath157 is very small .",
    "however , the scattering onto the fourth hole kramers doublet , @xmath158 , is much larger and its absolute value amounts to @xmath159 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath160 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "such an element describes the coulomb coupling between configurations @xmath150 and @xmath161 . also , scattering with hole transfer between the second and third kramers doublet is sizeable and amounts to about @xmath162 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath163 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "the energy scales set by these coulomb elements are to be compared with the energy separation of the hole states , which ranges from about @xmath164 to about @xmath165 mev .",
    "thus , the diagonal coulomb electron - hole terms , i.e. , those that do not lead to a change of the electron - hole configuration , are about @xmath166 times larger than the separation of the hole states . on the other hand , the scattering elements , describing the change of configuration , are approximately of the same order as this separation .",
    "therefore at this point it is not clear whether the ground state of the x can be approximated by a single configuration or it is rather a correlated system , with the hole spread out among the four lowest kramers doublets .",
    "the second type of the coulomb matrix elements in play is the electron - hole exchange .",
    "let us specify the exchange elements involving the lowest kramers doublets - one for the electron and one for the hole .",
    "as these elements are spin sensitive , let us first point out that the tb model allows us to compute only the states of electrons in the conduction and valence bands .",
    "in order to describe the optics of our system in the usual language of quasi - particles , we have to change the treatment of the valence band by renaming the missing valence electron `` spin up '' into the valence hole `` spin down '' . having this in mind , and working for the moment in the language of electrons only , we find that the absolute value of the element @xmath167 mev , while @xmath168 mev in the case ( i ) . in the case ( ii )",
    "the absolute value of these elements is @xmath169 mev and @xmath170 mev , respectively . in the language of quasi - particles",
    "these diagonal exchange terms describe the interaction correction to the electron - hole pairs with opposite spin ( the former two elements ) and parallel spin ( the latter two elements ) . since the electron - hole exchange interaction enters the total hamiltonian with the positive sign , the quasi - particle pairs with antiparallel spins ( i.e. , the optically active ones ) will have higher energy than those with parallel spins .",
    "the remaining exchange terms within this manifold of states are offdiagonal , and their absolute values do not exceed @xmath171 @xmath172ev . as a result , due to the electron - hole exchange we expect a fine structure of the x composed of two pairs of states , separated by a gap of several mev , and each pair nearly degenerate .    to conclude the discussion of the electron - hole coulomb matrix elements",
    ", we comment on how these elements are impacted by the difference in treatments of nearest neighbors , i.e. , the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we find that the treatment ( ii ) gives consistently larger magnitudes of the elements , however the difference is only about 5% in the direct terms and about 20% in the smallest exchange terms . from the general formulas for coulomb elements given by eqs .",
    "( [ coulomb_nn_slater ] ) and ( [ coulomb_remote ] ) we see that the nearest - neighbor term scales as the number of atoms @xmath28 , while the remote term scales as @xmath173 . as a result",
    ", the change in treatment of nearest neighbors will be more visible in smaller nanocrystals .",
    "in what follows we will employ the simplified treatment ( ii ) , as the resulting change of energies is small compared to other energy scales in the system , and the simplification of the treatment of nearest neighbors leads to a considerable speedup in calculations .",
    "let us now move on to constructing the correlated states of the interacting electron - hole pair . as was already mentioned ,",
    "we accomplish this by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ interacting_hamiltonian ] ) set up in the basis of electron - hole configurations . with @xmath133 atoms present in the system , and the tb basis of @xmath166 orbitals per atom , we can distribute our particles on @xmath174 single - particle states , out of which we have @xmath175 hole and @xmath176 electron states . as a result",
    ", there exist @xmath177 excitonic configurations . since in this work",
    "we focus on the low - energy excitonic configurations only , instead of dealing with the full basis we shall build the electron - hole configurations out of single - particle states closest to the bandgap .",
    "the computational effort grows rapidly with the increase of the number of single - particle basis involved in the calculation .",
    "the most time- and resource - intensive part is the computation of coulomb matrix elements , as each element involves @xmath178 operations , and for @xmath179 electron and @xmath180 hole states we require @xmath181 electron - electron elements , @xmath182 hole - hole elements , and @xmath183 electron - hole elements .",
    "the evolution of the x spectra as a function of the basis size is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - baseladders](a ) . in the left - hand panel",
    "we show the x energies resulting from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian built using @xmath184 electron states ( i.e. , the lowest , s - shell kramers doublet ) and @xmath185 hole states ( i.e. , the lowest four kramers doublets separated from the rest of the hole spectrum by a gap ) .",
    "this results in @xmath186 electron - hole configurations . in the middle panel",
    "we include more hole states by increasing @xmath180 to @xmath187 , whilst in the right - hand panel we compute with @xmath188 ( i.e. , the s and p shells ) and @xmath189 .",
    "this increase of the single - particle basis gives respectively @xmath190 and @xmath191 configurations .",
    "we see , overall , that as the basis is increased , the energy of the lowest level decreases , but not by a large amount compared to the bandwidth of the excitonic states . moreover , the excitonic states are grouped into blocks separated by gaps .",
    "the lowest energy block , consistent throughout the three spectra , is built out of configurations from the lowest electronic doublet and the four lowest hole doublets of single - particle states .",
    "the second block , apparent in the middle panel , involves the hole residing on higher single - particle states , and the gap separating it from the lower section is consistent with the gap in the single - particle hole spectrum .",
    "finally , in the right - hand panel we see two spectra from the middle panel , stacked on top of one another .",
    "further , the top half of this ladder of states is denser than the bottom half .",
    "such a distinct structure of the spectra is due to a large gap between the electron single - particle s and p shells . as a result",
    ", the third block from the bottom is composed of the hole residing on the four lowest single - particle levels , but the electron occupying one of the six p - shell levels .",
    "similarly , the highest block contains configurations with an electron on the @xmath2 shell and the hole on states deeper in the valence band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - baseladders](b ) we show the dependence of the x ground - state energy on the hole basis size for three cases : electron on the @xmath1 shell only ( black squares ) , on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 shells ( red circles ) , and on the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath92 shells ( green triangles ) .",
    "we see that as a function of @xmath192 the x energy follows a power law and it is not completely converged even for the largest hole basis used ( @xmath193 states ) .",
    "we notice also a marked decrease of the x energy as subsequent electronic shells enter the picture .",
    "as the electron spreads to the p shell , the energy drops by about @xmath194 mev , while allowing the electron to spread to the d shell results in a smaller decrease .",
    "note that the overall drop in energy is about @xmath166 mev , most of it accomplished by using the three electronic shells , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath92 ( altogether 18 states ) and increasing the hole basis to @xmath189 states .",
    "the energy drop is of the order of coulomb electron - hole direct scattering matrix elements and is somewhat larger than the separation of the lowest four hole single - particle states , but it is an order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal direct coulomb elements describing the electron - hole attraction .    in view of the slow convergence of x",
    "energies it is necessary to establish a scheme for extraction of their converged values . to this end",
    "we first extrapolate each of the curves from fig .",
    "[ fig : x - baseladders](b ) to zero ( i.e. , infinite number of hole basis states ) .",
    "then we use the energies obtained for each @xmath179 to extrapolate to infinite number of electron states . in our case ,",
    "the extrapolated ground - state energy of the exciton is @xmath195 ev .    because of the commensurability of the energy change due to correlations and the single - particle energy scale we now examine the spectral content of the several low - lying x states in the case of @xmath188 and @xmath189 , i.e. , in the regime when the energy is already relatively close to convergence .",

    "we find that the two lowest x states are nearly degenerate ( to within @xmath196 @xmath172ev ) and are composed predominantly ( in 95% ) of the configurations with the electron and hole occupying their respective lowest single - particle states , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , and assuming the same spin character ( i.e. , approximately `` spin parallel '' ) .",
    "such configurations can be written as @xmath150 and @xmath199 and are shown schematically in the upper left - hand and upper right - hand panel of fig .",

    "we now proceed to calculating the energies and wave functions of a system of two electron - hole pairs forming a bi - exciton ( xx ) .",
    "since now we deal with pairs of carriers of the same type , we need to establish the electron - electron and hole - hole matrix elements . in computations",
    "we also consider the two cases of treating the nearest - neighbor contributions , as discussed previously for the electron - hole elements .",
    "let us consider the electron - electron elements first .",
    "the diagonal element defining the interaction energy of the two - electron configuration on the lowest single - particle levels @xmath202 is @xmath203 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath204 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "it is somewhat smaller ( by about 5% ) than the fundamental electron - hole element discussed in the previous section .",
    "a similar element for the holes , defining the interaction energy of the hole pair @xmath205 is @xmath206 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath207 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "it is much larger than the fundamental electron - electron and electron - hole elements .",
    "we find this to be the case for all sizes of spherical cdse nanocrystals studied ( from @xmath208 nm to @xmath209 nm ) .",
    "a possible reason for this disparity between various types of matrix elements lies in the difference of charge densities corresponding to the electron and hole single - particle ground states .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the vertical cross - section of the ground - state charge density for the electron computed by the qnano package .",
    "as can be seen , this density is distributed across the entire crystal , it is largest in the center and tapers off towards the surfaces .",
    "small irregularities in this image are due to the lack of the symmetry plane of the nanocrystal , which is built out of @xmath210 layers of atoms .",
    "this is why we find a finite density on the lowest atomic layer , while the top layer appears to carry no charge .",
    "an analogous profile for the ground hole state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . here",
    "we see a clear lack of symmetry , with the maximum charge located in the lower half of the nanocrystal .",
    "also , the hole appears to occupy a much smaller volume than the electron does .",
    "note that neither of the wave functions is centered in the nc .",
    "this is due to wurtzite structure of nc , particularly due to polarity of the ( 0001 ) direction which results in the development of internal dipole moment .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of such a dipole in our dft calculations ( not shown here ) , however we find that the direction and strength of this dipole is sensitive to the type of ligands used to passivate the nc surface .",
    "the decreased spatial extent of the hole state leads to a large magnitude of the coulomb repulsion of two holes placed on the lowest kramers doublet , since the charge density of these two states is identical . in the electron case the more uniform spread of the density across the crystal diminishes the electron - electron element .",
    "the electron - hole element is also decreased , as we deal here with a relatively localized hole interacting with a distributed electron charge .",
    "let us now look at the scattering matrix elements , which describe the coulomb coupling between different configurations . for holes",
    "the largest element transferring the particle from the lowest kramers doublet is @xmath211 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath212 mev in the case ( ii ) . to assess the strength of this element in a meaningful way ,",
    "let us first analyze briefly a two - hole configuration @xmath213 .",
    "compared to the fundamental configuration @xmath205 , the excited configuration is created by moving the hole from the first to the fourth kramers doublet and so its single - particle energy is higher by about @xmath214 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction energy of the excited two - hole configuration is given by the matrix element @xmath215 , which is @xmath216 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath217 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "that is , in this excited configuration the holes repel by about @xmath218 mev weaker than in the fundamental one .",
    "so , altogether , the configuration @xmath213 is _ lower in energy , _ even though it has a larger single - particle energy part .",
    "the energy difference between the two configurations is then only about @xmath219 mev , suggesting that the offdiagonal scattering matrix elements will lead to the appearance of strongly correlated hole - hole states .",
    "let us now account for the presence of the two electrons .",
    "the electron - hole attraction gives a negative contribution to the total energy of the system .",
    "in any xx configuration we have four constituent terms , as each electron attracts two holes . for this discussion",
    "we need also the electron - hole matrix element @xmath220 mev in case ( i ) and @xmath221 mev in case ( ii ) . comparing this element with the fundamental electron - hole direct element given in the previous section",
    "we see that the electron attracts the hole on the level @xmath12 by about @xmath222 mev weaker than it does the hole on the ground single - particle level .",
    "now we are in a position to compare the energies of configurations @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "owing to the electron - hole direct terms we find that the former , i.e. , the fundamental configuration of the two electron - hole pairs , is about @xmath225 mev lower in total energy than that with one excited hole . as we see , the final alignment of levels results from cancellations of large interaction terms of comparable magnitude , and as such will be sensitive to the details of many - body computation .",
    "the smallest contribution to scattering comes from the electron - electron interaction .",
    "transfer of one electron from the @xmath1-shell orbitals to the @xmath2-shell orbitals due to this interaction is described , e.g. , by an element @xmath226 mev in the case ( i ) and @xmath227 mev in the case ( ii ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the energy gap between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic shells , which amounts to @xmath134 mev .",
    "so , the spread of electrons onto the @xmath2 shell due to the electron - electron interaction is expected to be small .",
    "we now proceed to diagonalizing the two - pair hamiltonian as a function of the size of the single - particle basis .",

    "let us now present a detailed comparison of the xx and x emission spectra . as already mentioned , the exciton recombines to vacuum , and therefore the position of the respective emission peak equals to the energy of the x. in the simplest treatment we approximate the x state by one configuration @xmath249 .",
    "the emission energy of such a state , neglecting for now the electron - hole exchange , is @xmath250 .",
    "the bi - exciton , on the other hand , recombines to the final - state exciton .",
    "the energy of the fundamental xx configuration @xmath251 is @xmath252 and accounts for the repulsion of the like carriers and attraction of each pair of opposite carriers .",
    "the position of the xx fundamental emission peak can then be evaluated as @xmath253 .",

    "if the electron - electron and hole - hole elements are equal to the electron - hole terms , the self - energy corrections cancel out and the xx emission peak matches that of the exciton .",
    "however , as demonstrated above , the hole - hole repulsive interaction is significantly larger than the electron - hole element , and so from that simple analysis we expect the xx peak to occur at the energy _ higher _ than that of x , i.e. , we expect the xx to be unbound , as is found in some epitaxial dots ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "let us now compare the emission peak positions of x and xx.@xcite figure  [ fig : xandxx - hitemp ] shows these spectra on the same energy scale .",

    "[ fig : xandxx - hitemp](top left panel ) with a black line . note that in this graph only the position of this peak is meaningful , since , as we have already mentioned , we do not model dynamical phenomena taking place in the system . on the other hand , as the temperature is increased to @xmath255k , excited x states are populated , resulting in optically allowed excitonic recombination .",
    "the high - temperature emission maximum computed assuming the maxwell - boltzmann thermal distribution of carriers and including model inhomogeneous broadening , is shown with the red continuous line in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xandxx - hitemp ] .",
    "as already discussed , this maximum is shifted towards higher energies by about @xmath166 mev .",
    "let us now move on to the xx spectra ( the two bottom panels of fig .",

    "this , however , does not have to mean that the emission peak will shift towards higher energies , as was the case for the exciton .",
    "indeed , the xx states recombine to excited x states , while the x states can only recombine to the vacuum .",
    "depending on the oscillator strengths appropriate for each of the possible xx - x transitions we may deal with additional higher - energy peaks ( when excited xx states recombine to low - lying x states ) or low - energy maxima ( when the final x states lie high in energy ) . figure  [ fig : xandxx - hitemp](lower right panel ) demonstrates that in the studied system we deal with the latter case .",
    "if we also account for inhomogeneous broadening ( red continuous line ) , we find that the overall emission maximum moves towards _ lower _ energies , i.e. , exhibits a trend opposite to that of the exciton .",
    "let us now compare the two spectra . in the @xmath12 k case ( the two left panels ) , due to the interplay of coulomb elements",
    ", we predict the xx emission peak at a slightly higher energy than the x maximum , i.e. , we find that the xx becomes unbound . however , as the temperature is raised to @xmath255 k ( the two right panels ) , the opposite shifts in the x and xx spectra lead to a rearrangement of the order of the peaks , so that the xx maximum is found below the x.    in the last element of our analysis we study the relative positions of the x and xx emission maxima as a function of the nc size . in fig .",
    "[ fig : unbindingsize ] we show several characteristic quantities measuring the position of the xx peak relative to the x peak , i.e. , the xx binding energy .",
    "black squares show the difference @xmath256 computed earlier in the single - configuration approach neglecting the electron - hole exchange .",
    "as can be seen , this difference is positive ( i.e. , the xx is unbound@xcite ) for all nc sizes studied .",
    "next we include the electron - hole exchange effects and correlations by computing the xx binding energy with the basis of @xmath188 and @xmath189 single - particle states . in this case",
    "we present two sets of results , shown with filled symbols .",
    "the red ( blue ) circles show the difference between the xx lowest - energy peak and that of the dark ( bright ) exciton ; the splitting between these two sets of data is due to the electron - hole exchange .",
    "we find that if the position of the xx peak is measured relative to the dark exciton , the xx becomes unbound for nc diameters smaller than @xmath12 nm . on the other hand , if the bright exciton is considered , the xx is always bound , in contrast to the single - configuration calculation .",
    "however , as demonstrated earlier , the basis set taken in this calculation is not sufficient to achieve convergence of the x and xx energies . to eliminate this systematic error",
    ", we extrapolate the x and xx energies presented in fig .",

    "note , however , that after extrapolation to the infinite basis set the xx becomes unbound , which demonstrates the need for systematic convergence study .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the electronic and optical properties of an exciton and a bi - exciton confined in a single , spherical cdse nanocrystal . using the atomistic tight - binding approach we have calculated the single - particle spectra and found that the lowest energy hole states form a shell consisting of four states separated from the rest of levels by a gap .",
    "the bi - exciton state was computed using configuration interaction techniques and found to be a strongly correlated state consisting of a two electron singlet in the @xmath1-shell of the conduction band and a strongly correlated state of two holes distributed on the degenerate hole shell , resulting in a fine structure of bi - exciton energy levels .",
    "the fine structure is also present in the exciton spectrum , however it is due to the electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "the bi - exciton fine structure becomes apparent in the absorption of the second exciton into the nanocrystal .",
    "we find that if the initial state exciton is prepared in the bright configuration , the maximum indicating the absorption of the second pair is found at the same energy as the emission peak from xx .",
    "however , if we prepare the exciton in the dark state , the absorption takes place to higher xx states in the quasi - degenerate manifold . as for the emission spectra",
    ", we found that at a low temperature the bi - exciton emission peak corresponds to an energy slightly higher than the energy of the excitonic ground , dark state , i.e. , the xx is unbound .",
    "however , at higher temperatures the exciton emits from the excited bright state , so that the inhomogeneously broadened x emission peak moves to higher energies . on the other hand , thermal population of higher xx levels leads to emission to excited final x states , moving the broadened xx emission peak to lower energies , even below the high - temperature emission maximum .",
    "a similar transition in the character of xx can be achieved by changing the diameter of the nanocrystal : for diameters of up to @xmath12 nm the xx is unbound , while for larger ncs the xx becomes bound . due to the complicated nature of the spectrum of the valence hole we find that in all elements of our analysis the correlations play a crucial role and that any qualitative conclusions as to the electronic and optical properties of x and xx can be drawn only after a careful convergence analysis",

    "we plan to improve the description of screening and carry out a computation of the distance - dependent dielectric function.@xcite we are going to develop a more realistic model of the surface passivation accounting for the presence of ligands . the more microscopic description of the surface is also needed for a proper description of the nc shape .",
