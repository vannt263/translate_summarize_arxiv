    "with the continual refinement of laser arrays , and optical fibers , the role of coupled waveguide systems in integrated optics has magnified in the past few years .",
    "the fabrication of arrays which use parallel dielectrics as guiding structures has been demonstrated in millimeter - wave dielectric circuits .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of waves in planar dielectric sheet waveguides provides a means of reflectionless signal transfer from one waveguide to another . for these systems , generally the constituent",
    "dielectric materials are presumed to have positive values of the electric permittivity , @xmath0 and magnetic permeability , @xmath1 .",
    "recently , however there has been interest in researching materials which have the unusual property of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 being negative , a concept first proposed by veselago @xcite long ago .",
    "these materials support electromagnetic wave propagation in which the phase velocity is antiparallel to the energy flow , or group velocity .",
    "furthermore , if both @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are negative in a medium , the refractive index has the extraordinary property of also being negative , therefore such media are given the name negative index media ( nim ) , compared with the more familiar positive index media ( pim)-where both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are positive . as discussed by veselago @xcite ,",
    "a multitude of other anomalous characteristics of nim follow from maxwell s equations , including reversal of the doppler shift , counter - directed cherenkov radiation cone , and the refocusing of em waves from a point source .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a nim slab can focus focus both near and far fields , attaining perfect resolution due to the amplification of the evanescent waves . subsequently however , the original  perfect lens \" model was modified @xcite to overcome limitations of imperfect materials by introducing a multilayer stack . while the study of various nim structures has intensified during the past few years",
    ", the number of theoretical works involving waveguides with nim components is less common .",
    "the @xmath2 parameters and electromagnetic properties were investigated @xcite numerically for a @xmath3 junction nim waveguide configuration , and a simple plane two - layered waveguide was shown @xcite to have a slow - wave factor that tends to infinity at small frequencies .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the fabrication of devices constructed with nim is less prolific , as there are no naturally occurring nim in nature , and thus one must artificially engineer a composite system having the desired electromagnetic properties .",
    "one such medium was constructed @xcite in which the effective permeability and effective permittivity were shown to be simultaneously less than zero over a finite frequency band .",
    "these structures that simulated a nim were comprised of a periodic array of unit cells , where each cell contained two split metallic rings located on a dielectric panel along with one copper wire .",
    "the overall medium is considered homogeneous since the elements of each cell varied over length scales much smaller than the wavelengths used in the experiments .",
    "the experimental situation involving these unconventional materials is thus in the early stages of development , and there exists a broad range of potential applications , including optical and microwave devices .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the electromagnetic properties of a coupled planar dielectric waveguide system . in order to study the interaction between nim and pim configurations ,",

    "in this section we give a brief overview of the model used for our coupled waveguide system .",
    "the schematic of the planar dielectric waveguide is illustrated in fig .",
    "the structure consists of two waveguide channels embedded in a medium characterized by the free space parameters @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . the upper waveguide layer of width @xmath6 has permittivity @xmath7 and permeability @xmath8 , and the lower guide of width @xmath9 has permittivity @xmath10 and permeability @xmath11 .",
    "the two channels are separated by a central film that is @xmath12 in width and is divided in the plane at @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 axis of the coordinate system coincides with the axis of the guide .",
    "we are interested in guided wave modes , which are electromagnetic waves that propagate along the waveguide with a given phase and group velocity , intensity distribution , and polarization .",
    "these modes are relevant since the corresponding fields satisfy the wave equation throughout the structure , and the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , each mode is characterized by its frequency @xmath15 and its wave vector @xmath16 . to proceed ,",
    "we assume a sinusoidal time dependence @xmath17 for the fields .",
    "the dielectric media is linear and isotropic in the @xmath18 and @xmath14 directions .",
    "the translational invariance in the @xmath18 and @xmath14 direction allows , ( for the case of tm modes ) one to write the magnetic field @xmath19 as , @xmath20 $ ] , where we have factored out the spatial variation of the field in the @xmath21 direction , and @xmath16 is the @xmath14 component of the wave vector . employing maxwell s equations",

    "what follows , we consider material parameters in the nim regions to be dispersive , otherwise the energy density would be negative @xcite .",
    "we take the permittivity and permeability to have the form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the effective electrical and magnetic plasma frequencies @xcite , respectively . to simplify the model , we have neglected damping .",
    "elementary solutions to eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) admit the following wave vectors , @xmath27 where the wave vectors are labeled according to the respective values of the permeability and permittivity in each region depicted in fig .",
    "it is clear that the longitudinal wave vector @xmath16 , common to all the layers , serves as a connection to constrain the transverse components .",
    "the widths of the middle layer and the two waveguide channels are given by @xmath28 , and @xmath29 respectively , where @xmath30 .",
    "the red curve corresponds to the symmetric modes , and the blue curve is for the asymmetric modes .",

    "the inset is a magnification of the same quantity localized around one of the bending features .",
    "the numbers label points of interest as discussed in the text .",
    "[ nim],width=384 ]    we consider first the case where the permittivity and permeability are both simultaneously negative in each waveguide core , and each of the guiding layers has the same width @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ pic ] ) . to derive the tm modes , we proceed to seek elementary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) that do not radiate away from the system . upon invoking the continuity of @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the interfaces ,",
    "we arrive at the following eigenvalue equation or dispersion relation for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes : @xmath34 where we have introduced a phase angle @xmath35 , @xmath36 we show in fig .",
    "[ nim ] , the dispersion relation for the case where all the dielectric layers are made of nim .",
    "we plot @xmath16 normalized by a design frequency @xmath37 versus the dimensionless frequency @xmath38 . in the following , we take @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "all curves are bound by the light line , @xmath41 , and the limiting line @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the  phase - space \" available for guided wave modes is contained within the area spanned by these two lines , and increases rapidly upon decreasing @xmath15 , due to material dispersion .",
    "the figure illustrates the dispersion diagram with a finite number of bands , which arise from the geometrical constraint placed upon the fields from the bounding surfaces . since the fields outside the waveguide channels decay over the length scale @xmath43 , regions of the dispersion curves near the light line correspond to a larger decay length , thus the fields reside mainly outside the guiding layer .",
    "the opposite is true for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 dispersion pair which reside in the vicinity of the line @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of increasing the coupling ( decreasing @xmath44 ) between the two waveguide cores has the trend of increasing the divide between the two modal bands with different symmetry .",
    "although not visible in the plot , the zeroth order tm mode is cutoff in frequency , in contrast to the usual pim case where there is no frequency cutoff . by way of comparison , we also show in fig .",
    "[ nim ] , the dispersion curve for a single nim waveguide .",
    "it is apparent that the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are centered about the single waveguide case .",
    "one of the most dramatic features of the dispersion relation is the bending back of the bands close to the light line .",
    "this is a behavior seen in general whenever a waveguide channel consisting of nim is in proximity to a material with pim characteristics .",

    "[ nim ] shows a close up of the second modal branch .",
    "some salient features to be noted are the change in slope of the dispersion curve , varying from positive to negative as one cycles through the points @xmath45 respectively .",
    "we thus find some peculiarities in the dispersion diagram that clearly deviate from the well understood coupled waveguide system with conventional dielectric material .",
    "as will be discussed below , there is an abrupt reversal of energy flow in the @xmath14-direction between the two different media , and this quite naturally is reflected in the allowed guided wave modes . in order to further investigate this anomalous behavior of the energy flow in the vicinity of a bend ,",
