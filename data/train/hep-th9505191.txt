    "self - gravitational correction as a possible physical mechanism for resolving ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theories has been discussed over the years by a number of authors .",
    "some of the earliest published speculations along this line were put forth by landau @xcite , klein @xcite , pauli @xcite , and deser @xcite .",
    "a definitive determination of the finite mass of the classical point charge was worked out by arnowitt , deser , and misner @xcite in the context of a non - singular metric ( different from the conventional singular reissner ",
    "nordstrm metric for this situation ) .",
    "this mass for the classical point charge has recently been independently rederived by the author @xcite .",
    "@xcite emphasizes that , for this highly singular source of gravitational field , the countervailing ( negative)effective energy density due to the resulting very strong gravitational field itself , carefully taken into account in self - consistent fashion , is critical to obtaining the correct finite value for the point charge s mass .",
    "subsequent work by dewitt @xcite , khriplovich @xcite , salam and strathdee @xcite , and isham , salam , and strathdee @xcite has approached the ultraviolet divergences of quantum electrodynamics through correcting the lowest - order feynman diagrams in which they occur by various types of summed graviton - exchange ladders .",
    "these simple graviton - exchange processes do not , however , include the non - linear feature that the virtual gravitons interact _ with each other _ , which was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to be so crucial to the proper self - gravitational resolution of the infinite mass of the classical point charge",
    ". moreover , the graviton - exchange ladder sums are generally not by themselves gravitationally gauge - invariant @xcite , and can in addition introduce difficulties with electromagnetic gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "khriplovich looked into the effects of making different choices of gravitational gauge in his approach , and found that some of these seemed unlikely to result in the suppression of the ultraviolet divergences @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quantized electron mass electromagnetic correction obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( by straightforward extension of the non - singular metric approach that was used for the classical point charge )  is found to incorporate a gravitationally induced effective cutoff radius which depends in a physically sensible way on the electron charge ",
    "in contrast with the puzzling charge independence of that effective cutoff radius in the result obtained by means of the ladder - sum approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    the self - gravitational treatment in this paper of the ultraviolet - divergent second - order `` vacuum polarization '' radiative correction insertion feynman diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacpol ] is essentially the same as the quantum field theoretic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in most respects .",
    "since the focus here is on self - gravitational suppression of the quantum electrodynamically induced ultraviolet divergence , the ref .",
    "@xcite restriction that gravity is only coupled to the electromagnetic interaction term of the action integral is observed , as it is this interaction term which generates the feynman diagram electromagnetic vertices , without which there could be no electromagnetically induced ultraviolet divergences .",
    "thus the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacpol ] is permitted to couple to intermediate virtual gravitons which travel between its two vertices ",
    "these produce the part of its self - gravitational correction which could be capable of impinging on its ultraviolet divergence . ref .",
    "@xcite uses the `` graviton superpropagator '' approximation framework to describe the propagation of these intermediate virtual gravitons .",
    "this `` graviton superpropagator '' is , of course , a member of the species of summed graviton - exchange ladders  whose shortcomings in describing ultrastrong gravitational effects engendered by an ultraviolet divergence were touched upon in the discussion above .",
    "the `` superpropagator '' approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite is therefore replaced by use of the full einstein field equation to self - consistently describe the propagation of the intermediate virtual gravitons .",
    "fourier transformed from four - momentum space to configuration space ",
    "time , the insertion diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacpol ] has the proper dimensions and other attributes of a stress - energy tensor , although , being complex - valued , it is , of course , a virtual stress - energy .",
    "it also possesses a non - integrable singularity on the light cone , which is the feature that results in its ultraviolet divergence upon fourier transformation back to four - momentum space .",
    "this complex - valued virtual stress - energy gives rise , via the einstein equation , to a complex - valued virtual metric that far more satisfactorily describes the intermediate virtual graviton propagation in this ultraviolet - divergent situation than does the `` superpropagator '' approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite . from this virtual metric",
    "we obtain the self - gravitationally corrected virtual stress - energy by the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely we calculate @xmath1 times the part of the einstein tensor which is linear in the virtual gravitational field ( that field is defined as the virtual metric tensor minus the minkowskian flat - space metric tensor ) .",
    "this self - gravitationally corrected virtual stress - energy tensor turns out to be non - singular ( it actually vanishes on the light cone ) , and it fourier transforms back to four - momentum space as the self - gravitationally corrected and ultraviolet - convergent version of the insertion feynman diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacpol ] .",
    "a notable by - product of full einstein equation propagation of virtual gravitons , which takes proper account of their non - linear interactions with each other , is that the subsequent perturbative treatment of these non - linearities is thus avoided  eliminating the source of the ultraviolet divergences of the second - quantized gravity theory itself .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out here that a systematic general approach to the full theory of self - gravitationally coupled quantum electrodynamics along the lines discussed above would involve the usual perturbation expansion in the purely electromagnetic interaction combined with a stationary treatment of the gravitational field degrees of freedom in the feynman path integration of the total action .",
    "the virtual stress - energy occurring in the resulting einstein equation for the virtual metric could then be simplified by eliminating terms which do _ not _ contribute in an ultraviolet - divergent fashion to the problem being treated , since any such `` ordinary '' self - gravitational corrections to quantum electrodynamics can be expected to be completely negligible at attainable energies .",
    "the justification of the key stationary approximation for the gravitational degrees of freedom in the feynman path integration can be argued as follows .",
    "when gravitational effects are sufficiently weak , gravity theory is essentially linear , and for linear field theories the stationary approximation to feynman path integration in their field variables happens to be exact .",
    "moreover , the gravitational action contains terms such as the integral over space ",
    "time of the curvature scalar _ divided _ by the factor @xmath2 , which become _ large _ compared to @xmath3 long before the non - linear corrections to gravity theory , which are typically suppressed by a factor of @xmath4 relative to the linear terms , begin to contribute significantly . of course ,",
    "the `` classic '' ( i.e. , correspondence principle ) situation which justifies the stationary approximation to feynman path integration occurs precisely when the action is large compared to @xmath3 .",
    "the very considerable _ overlap _ here between this state of affairs ( which always obtains for sufficiently _ strong _ gravity ) and the `` effectively linear theory '' justification for the stationary approximation ( up to the point where the non - linear effects of gravitation intervene ) ensures that the stationary approximation is _ uniformly _ valid for any strength of gravitational effect which may be present .",
    "it seems plausible that the general approach envisioned here will essentially parallel that of ref .",
    "@xcite , except that the `` graviton superpropagator '' of the latter will be replaced by full einstein equation propagation of virtual intermediate gravitons , and perturbative treatment of non - linear parts of the einstein equation can not arise .",
    "detailed formal development of this envisioned systematic general approach to self - gravitationally coupled quantum electrodynamics is not attempted in the present paper ; that very substantial endeavor is deferred to a future time .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : vpmomentum ] the usual four - momentum space treatment of the insertion diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacpol ] . is reviewed . in section  [",
    "sect : vpconfiguration ] the full details of the analogous treatment in configuration space  time , where this diagram is seen to be a virtual stress - energy tensor , are spelled out ( the virtual stress - energy character of the higher - order versions of this diagram is demonstrated as well ) . in section",
    "[ sect : selfgravitycorrection ] this virtual stress - energy is propagated with the full einstein equation to obtain its corresponding virtual metric , which in turn yields the self - gravitationally corrected virtual stress - energy .",
    "the consequences for the four - momentum space diagram itself of this self - gravitational correction , such as the suppression of the ultraviolet divergence , the absence of any contribution to charge renormalization , and its behaviour at extreme momentum transfer , are set forth in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "there it is also pointed out that the closely related second - order electromagnetic vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude correction diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vacvac ] , which has an extreme ( quartic ) ultraviolet divergence , can be shown to vanish identically after the same self - gravitational correction .",

    "in this section the standard four - momentum space approach to the ultraviolet - divergent `` vacuum polarization '' radiative correction insertion diagram shown in fig .",
