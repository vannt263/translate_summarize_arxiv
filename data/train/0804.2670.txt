    "we have detected the emission - line light echo and the low - energy ( nuv , optical , nir ) sed tail of a high - energy ( euv , x - ray ) outburst of the galaxy sdssj0952 + 2143 .",
    "the euv  x - ray part of the flare was not observed directly , but the presence of a strong ionizing continuum at high - state is implied by the strong h@xmath17 and heii lines and by the large iron - line fluxes relative to [ oiii ] .",
    "further , the ionization potentials of heii and of the iron lines ( up to 358 ev ; fexiv ) imply that the ionizing continuum extended into the soft x - ray regime .",
    "while x - ray variability is common in agn , amplitudes exceeding a factor of @xmath03050 are rare ( e.g. , komossa 2002 ) and they almost never come with a reported measurable emission - line response",
    ". outbursts of high amplitude are of special interest , because they provide tight constraints on accretion physics under extreme conditions .",
    "furthermore , as the flare travels through the circumnuclear material , its emission - line light echo puts us in the rare situation to be able to perform `` reverberation mapping '' not only of the blr , but potentially also of the accretion disk region , the coronal - line region ( clr ) , the molecular torus , and the narrow - line region ( nlr ) of active galaxies ( ulmer 1999 , komossa & bade 1999 ) , and it allows us to detect which of these regions are also present in non - active galaxies ( komossa 2002 ) .      since x - ray monitoring simultaneous with and after",
    "the sdss observations does not exist , we can only indirectly estimate the amplitude of variability of the outburst .",
    "the fluxes of the iron lines , relative to [ oiii ] , observed in 2005 ( 1 year after the highest observed state in 2004 ) , are much higher than those in any other agn in sdss - dr6 . the observed ( 2005 ; post - high - state ) ratio [ fex]/[oiii ] is a factor of 60 ( 20 ) higher than the seyfert 2 ( seyfert 1 ) average of nagao et al .",

    "it is possible that all emission lines were excited by the flare . alternatively ,",
    "sdssj0952 + 2143 may show permanent low - level activity traced by low - ionization lines .",
    "the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath21=2.5 puts the galaxy at the border between agn and liner .",
    "while the variable optical continuum likely is the tail of the high - energy continuum , the variable nir continuum during the 2004 sdss photometry high - state is best fit by an independent black body component of @xmath22 k , perhaps a signal of dust reprocessing before destruction .",
    "the measured temperature slightly exceeds the sublimation temperature @xmath23 of standard silicates and graphite ( e.g. , granato & danese 1994 ) , but non - standard grain sizes and decomposition may raise the limit on @xmath23 .      for the first time , transitions of [ fevii]3586,3759 as strong as [ oiii ] have been identified in a galaxy spectrum .",
    "several [ fevii ] line ratios can be used to estimate gas temperature and gas density",
    ". the observed high - state ratio of [ fevii]5158/[fevii]6087 @xmath24 0.2 implies a density of @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio [ fevii]3759/[fevii]6087=1 implies a temperature of at least @xmath26 k , and up to @xmath27 k if @xmath28 ( keenan & norrington 1987 ) . the high density and temperature inferred and the variability of the iron lines on the timescale of years implies an emission - region close to the active nucleus .",
    "possible sites of origin of the observed lines are the inner wall of the dusty torus , and/or the tidal debris of a disrupted star flung out from the system , and interacting with its environment ( khoklov & melia 1996 ) .",
    "monitoring of the fading lines will provide a key diagnostic of the physical conditions in the line - emitting region ; if this region corresponds to the dusty torus , we can do `` torus reverberation mapping '' this way .",
    "the h@xmath17 and h@xmath12 lines show a complex profile which can be decomposed into at least four components : a broad component with a width of 1930 kms@xmath3 redshifted by an extra 570 kms@xmath3 , a narrow component at the same redshift as other narrow forbidden lines , and two narrow horns , the more conspicuous one redshifted by 540 kms@xmath3 .",
    "double - peaked balmer lines have been detected in a number of agn ( see eracleous et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) . however , generally , it is the _ broad _ component of the balmer lines which is double peaked .",
    "the strong narrow horn has no counterpart in any other emission line ; it is only detected in h@xmath17 and h@xmath12 .",
    "one possible explanation is that it arises in a region of very high density ( such as the stellar post - disruption debris , or an accretion disk ; see sect .",
    "3.5 ) where forbidden lines are suppressed .",
    "the summed redshifted broad and narrow component of the h@xmath17 profile resembles to some extent , but not in detail , relativistic fek@xmath17 line profiles seen in some agn x - ray spectra ( review by miller 2007 ) .",
    "the broad balmer decrement , h@xmath17/h@xmath12=9.5 , likely implies a significant contribution from collisional excitation indicative of high density , or else is affected by optical depth effects .",
    "the highest amplitudes of variability detected to date , up to a factor of @xmath06000 , have essentially all been observed from non - active galaxies , and have been interpreted in terms of tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes ( komossa & bade 1999 , halpern et al .",
    "2004 , komossa et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "stars approaching a smbh will be tidally disrupted once the tidal forces of the smbh exceed the star s self - gravity , and part of the stellar debris will be accreted , producing a luminous flare of radiation which lasts on the timescale of months to years ( e.g. , carter & luminet 1982 , rees 1988 ; see komossa 2002 for a much longer list of references on theoretical aspects of tidal disruption ) .",
    "the outburst mechanism of sdssj0952 + 2143 is either related to processes in the accretion disk such as an instability ( only possible if sdssj0952 + 2143 is permanently active ) , or is else related to the tidal disruption of a star by the smbh at its center ( possible in both cases , active or non - active galaxy ) ; see komossa & bade ( 1999 ) for a discussion of relevant timescales of both mechanisms .",
    "at present , we can not tell whether sdssj0952 + 2143 harbors a permanent low - luminosity agn , traced by [ oii ] and [ oiii ] , or whether these lines were also excited by the flare and represent low - density ism / nlr emission close to our line of sight .    in the context of tidal disruption",
    ", the unusual profile and double - peakedness of the balmer lines can be understood as emission from the accretion disk formed from the stellar debris after disruption .",
    "while balmer line emission from different streams of the disrupted star looks complex during the first several months after disruption ( bogdanovic et al . 2004 ) , it would appear more like a normal disk - line thereafter .    while automized procedures are currently being set up to identify new flares rapidly in the course of current x - ray surveys ( yuan et al .",
    "2006 , esquej et al .",
    "2007 ) , spectroscopic surveys such as sdss - ii will allow us to perform independent flare searches by the detection of variable emission - line signatures .",
    "sdssj0952 + 2143 is exceptional among the few known flaring galaxies in its strong multi - wavelength variability , encompassing the nir , optical and nuv continuum sed , allowed and forbidden optical and nir emission lines , and the euv and x - ray sed .",
    "such a broadband line and continuum response has not been detected before .",
    "multi - wavelength monitoring of objects such as sdssj0952 + 2143 will enable us to follow the fading of the emission lines , providing a unique light echo mapping of the circumnuclear material potentially including the accretion disk , blr , torus , and ism ; and flung - out post - disruption stellar material if the cause of the flare was stellar tidal disruption ."
