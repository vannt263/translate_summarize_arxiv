    "in fact , by broadening the resonance condition in the kinetic equation , near - resonant interactions have recently been shown to have important consequences in statistical theories for the evolution of random wave fields ( janssen 2003 , annenkov & shrira 2006 ) .",
    "the present work , as with the foundational references , assumes an inherent heirarchy wherein much of the dynamics can be understood via exact and near - resonant interactions .",
    "of course , in reality there are contributions from interactions that are far from resonance .",
    "section 2.2 discusses exact resonances in the case @xmath8 ( for which there are no near - resonances ) , and section 2.3 discusses both exact and near - resonances for @xmath114 . in section 3 , the simulation results for the full dynamical equations ( 4 ) indicate that exact and near - resonances are indeed helpful to explain the evolution of energies and spectra associated with the dynamics for the parameter regimes considered herein .",
    "it is known that resonant interactions involving two wave and one vortical mode are catalytic in the sense that the vortical mode acts as a mediator of energy exchange between the wave modes but does not change itself ( bartello 1995 , embid & majda 1998 ) . keeping this mind , for the special case of for @xmath66 ( i.e.  @xmath115 ) , ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) simplify to    @xmath116    and we obtain bartello s equations ( see eqn 19 in bartello 1995 ) .",
    "note that , because there is no possibility of near - resonances when @xmath66 , the exchange of energy between the vortical and wave modes is likely to be a minimum , making the case @xmath8 quite possibly optimal in the sense of dynamical splitting between vortical and wave modes even at non - zero @xmath117 .",
    "+ in ( [ 9 ] ) , the vortical modes evolve as an independent 3d qg system , while the wave modes are advected via this qg flow ( see smith & waleffe 2002 for an explicit calculation showing that the @xmath118 interactions lead to the 3d qg potential vorticity ( pv ) equation ) .",
    "given that the vortical modes follow the 3d qg pv equation , we expect a large fraction of the energy entering these modes to flow upscale ( charney 1971 ) .",
    "further , the equations governing the wave modes are the same as those for a passive scalar and we have a situation wherein these uncoupled wave modes are advected by a predominantly large scale qg flow .",
    "further , this situation where the bulk of the energy of the advecting flow is at large scales qualitatively corresponds to the batchelor regime for passive scalars ( batchelor 1959 , kraichnan 1974 ) .",
    "this picture was verified by bartello s ( 1995 ) decaying simulations .",
    "starting from a ( fairly ) random large scale initial condition ( characterized by a scale @xmath119 ) and setting @xmath57 in ( [ 2 ] ) , it was seen that the energy in the vortical ( geostrophic ) modes moved upscale . for scales smaller than @xmath119",
    ", there emerged a transient @xmath19 potential enstrophy transfer spectrum .",
    "simultaneously , the energy in the wave ( ageostrophic ) modes moved downscale to be dissipated and resulted in a transient @xmath11 ( passive scalar like ) spectrum .",
    "as the wave mode frequencies begin to depend on wavenumber , not only do other classes of resonant interactions become permissible ( see below ) in the evolution of the wave and vortical modes , the aforementioned near - resonant interactions also enter the picture .",
    "indeed , when @xmath117 are small ( though @xmath120 ) and unequal , the vortical and wave modes are expected to evolve by and large independently , but we do expect some transfer of energy from the vortical to wave modes and vice versa due to the non - catalytic nature of the @xmath95 and @xmath121 near - resonances .",
    "+ _ vortical modes : _ it is expected that as long as both @xmath117 are small and comparable the vortical mode dynamics will be close to quasigeostrophy  as mentioned , these are the essential ingredients required for the rigorous demonstration of 3d qg dominance of the vortical modes ( babin et al .",
    "1997 , embid & majda 1998 ) . but",
    "note that in the @xmath122 , fixed @xmath25 limit ( i.e.  stratification dominated regime ) the vortical modes ( along with the @xmath123 slow wave modes ) evolve as a vertically sheared horizontal flow ( embid & majda 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast for @xmath124 , small @xmath25 ( purely rotating regime ) , the vortical mode in fact no longer exists .",
    "of course these are extreme cases , but they do prompt an inquiry into the behavior of the vortical modes as @xmath10 deviates from unity .",
    "+ _ wave modes : _ as compared to the @xmath125 case , we now have the added possibility of @xmath126 resonant and near - resonant interactions . however , exact @xmath126 resonances are difficult to achieve with discrete wavevectors given the algebraic complexity of simultaneously satisfying the triad and dispersion relations .",
    "in addition , they are only possible when @xmath127 or @xmath128 ( smith & waleffe 2002 ) .",
    "further , for @xmath129 , the analysis of babin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicates that the set of @xmath126 near resonances is very sparse .",
    "hence for moderate values of @xmath10 , it is unlikely that these additional resonant and near - resonant @xmath126 interactions would a cause significant deviation from the behavior seen for @xmath8 with constant wave mode frequencies .",
    "+ with regard to the @xmath121 interactions , as @xmath10 deviates from unity , these resonant and near - resonant interactions are restricted to wave modes that satisfy @xmath130 .",
    "thus the @xmath121 exact and near - resonances for @xmath131 are not as numerous as catalytic @xmath121 exact resonances for the case @xmath8 . in purely rotating flow , where the vortical mode no longer exists and @xmath75 denotes a zero frequency wave mode , this restriction ( which now becomes @xmath132 ) confines the @xmath121 interactions only to re - distribute energy among similar scales ( babin et al .",

    "in contrast , for a stratification dominated regime the presence of the vortical mode ( @xmath75 ) leads to the `` unfreezing '' of the ageostrophic forward transfer by the @xmath121 resonant and near - resonant interactions ( babin et al .",

    "by a series of numerical simulations we have examined the effect of varying @xmath45 on the vortical and wave modes of the 3d rotating boussinesq equations . specifically , we have focused on flows characterized by strong rotation and stratification , i.e.  both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are large so as keep @xmath150 and roughly comparable .",
    "in addition to the presence of the zero - frequency vortical mode , the system supports wave modes with frequencies @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "+ for @xmath152 ( i.e.  @xmath153 , stratification stronger than rotation ) , the wave mode energy saturates quite quickly .",
    "much like the well understood constant frequency ( @xmath66 ) case ( bartello 1995 ) , the resulting forward cascade continues to act as efficient way of removing ageostrophic energy from the system .",
    "simultaneously , the vortical modes exhibit a pronounced transfer of energy to large ( @xmath143 ) scales , while the high wavenumber energy spectra associated with the vortical modes scale as @xmath19 for @xmath13 . in essence , the picture painted in bartello ( 1995 ) involving the 3d qg dominance of the vortical modes and rapid adjustment via a wave mode cascade is valid for @xmath9 .",
    "this picture also agrees with the analytical work by babin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and embid & majda ( 1998 ) regarding the splitting of of the vortical and wave modes for @xmath154 wherein the vortical modes follow 3d qg dynamics while the wave mode cascades are `` unfrozen '' and result in an efficient transfer of energy to small scales . given that the wave modes saturate , it is also worth noting that our results clearly indicate the energetic dominance of the 3d qg dynamics when both @xmath107 are small ( though non - zero ) and the burger number is equal to or moderately larger than unity .",
    "interestingly , we observe that restrictions on the resonant and near - resonant @xmath121 interactions when @xmath114 appear to manifest themselves in a steepening of the high-@xmath22 wave mode spectra from a @xmath11 scaling ( a nonlocally dominated batchelor regime where the fast modes are predominantly driven in a passive manner ) to @xmath12 scaling ( a local 3d turbulence like behavior where the fast modes play a dynamically active role ) .",
    "further , we notice a bias in the partition of total energy among the different modes at varying scales . specifically , the vortical modes contain a large portion of the total energy at scales @xmath155 while the wave modes account for most of the energy at smaller scales .",
    "this naturally introduces a gradual steep - shallow transition in the total energy spectrum . in a broader context",
    ", the focus on forward transfers of energy in the present work serves as a counterpart to smith & waleffe ( 2002 ) wherein small scale random forcing was employed to probe the inverse transfer of energy for the regimes @xmath59 and @xmath156 , and to elucidate the resulting 3d qg or vshf dominance , respectively .",
    "+ proceeding to @xmath16 ( i.e.  @xmath157 , rotation stronger than stratification ) , we immediately detect an asymmetry in the behavior of the wave modes .",
    "indeed , now the wave modes never saturate and soon dominate the entire energy in the system . in spite of this , their spectra do appear to achieve near - invariance , i.e.  they appear to retain their shape while shifting upwards .",
    "further , for large @xmath10 there are signs of an emergent ( steeper than @xmath12 ) power law for an intermediate range of scales akin to the weak forward cascade in purely rotating turbulence ( cambon et al .",
    "1997 , yeung & zhou 1998 ) .",
    "this situation is similar to the observations for the shallow water equations whereby switching on rotation was seen to inhibit forward transfer ( yuan & hamilton 1994 ; see also farge & sadourny 1989 for remarks on the difficulty in achieving geostrophic adjustment in a similar scenario ) . as for @xmath18 ,",
    "the vortical modes continue to follow 3d qg dynamics though now their role is quite small since they contain only a small fraction of the total energy in the system .",
    "in fact , observing that the fraction of energy in the vortical modes decreases with increasing @xmath10 provides some hope that , at least in an energetic sense , the @xmath133 limit of the 3d rotating boussinesq system will transition smoothly to a purely rotating flow .",
    "the scaling of the vortical - mode spectra for @xmath16 shows a @xmath19 form for @xmath148 and is followed , for larger values of @xmath10 , by a shallower form for @xmath149 . finally ,",
    "in contrast to @xmath18 , now the wave modes dominate the total energy in the system for all @xmath23 .",
    "+ with regard to atmospheric phenomena , recent very high resolution studies of the rotating boussinesq equations with large scale forcing and @xmath158 in a skewed aspect ratio domain show a similar @xmath19 scaling for vortical - mode spectra , @xmath12 scaling for wave - mode spectra , and vortical - mode energy dominance at large scales ( kitamura & matsuda 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , the spectral transitions in the total energy ( also in the potential and kinetic energies ) that occur quite naturally in the boussinesq system ( see also the discussion in bartello 1995 ) when @xmath18 are reminiscent of the classic synoptic - mesoscale nastrom - gage spectrum ( nastrom & gage 1985 ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the @xmath12 portion of the boussinesq spectra arises from wave modes whereas some observational evidence points to a vortical mode dominance even at small scales ( cho , newell & barrick 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , as clearly put forth in the recent work of tulloch & smith ( 2006 ) , it is difficult to imagine a consistent theory of the midlatitude troposphere that does not explicitly address the potentially complicated evolution of buoyancy ( or potential temperature ) on domain boundaries ( see for example held et al .",
