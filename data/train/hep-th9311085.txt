    "the classical equations of motion for a string in curved spacetime are generally non - integrable due to their highly non - linear nature , and even if the system for some specific background can be shown to be integrable , it may be a very hard task to actually write down the general solution in closed form .",
    "in many cases of interest it is on the other hand not so difficult to find special solutions .",
    "the standard way is to make an _ ansatz _ that somehow exploits possible symmetries of the background and somehow is also based on physical insight in the specific case under consideration . if properly chosen this _",
    "ansatz _ may reduce the original system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations to something simpler , and special solutions may be found by quadratures .",
    "so for instance , if the background is axially symmetric one can look for circular strings , if the background is stationary one can look for stationary strings etc .",
    "a typical feature of non - linear systems is the presence of regions of unstable and chaotic motion , i.e. perturbations around certain special solutions develop imaginary frequencies and grow infinitely . in a recent paper loust and snchez @xcite considered such string - instabilities in black hole and de sitter spacetimes .",
    "their starting point was a method of studying string solutions in curved spacetimes , originally developed by de vega and snchez @xcite . by considering first order string perturbations around the center of mass motion of the string ( which is of course just a geodesic ) , loust and snchez fully analysed the behaviour of the solutions and found the regions of instability in the 3 cases of schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and de sitter backgrounds .    in this paper we will consider a somewhat similar situation .",
    "however , we will take as the unperturbed string configuration a circular string in the same 3 backgrounds , and we will in fact follow the analysis of ref.@xcite very closely . we will use a method , developed by frolov and the author @xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite),to study covariantly the physical perturbations around circular strings embedded in the curved spacetimes mentioned above .",
    "this program is mainly motivated by the recent interest in the dynamics of strings in curved backgrounds and the study of string instabilities in curved backgrounds : basu , guth and vilenkin @xcite showed that circular cosmic strings may nucleate in the end of the de sitter phase of the evolution of the universe ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) and thereby avoid to be inflated away from our visible universe .",
    "later vilenkin and garriga @xcite considered small perturbations around these nucleated strings both in the end of the de sitter phase and after having entered the radiation dominated aera .",
    "the evolution of circular cosmic strings in a radiation dominated universe has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , circular strings have recently been discussed in the context of a more systematic investigation of string dynamics in curved spacetimes @xcite , without considering perturbations around the rings , however .",
    "finally we mention that superconducting charge - current carrying circular strings in black hole backgrounds have been considered in @xcite .",
    "our work is a natural continuation of the analysis of loust and snchez @xcite and we hope it will give more insight into the connection between curved spacetimes and string - instabilities .",
    "we will confirm that in some cases ( for instance de sitter spacetime at @xmath1 @xcite ) the instabilities are really due to general features of the underlying curved background , while in other cases ( for instance reissner - nordstrm black hole for @xmath0 ) they are just artifacts of the dynamics of the special unperturbed solution considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will derive the equations of motion for the unperturbed circular string in the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and de sitter backgrounds",
    ". then we use the general formalism of ref.@xcite to obtain the linearised equations determining the physical ( transverse ) perturbations . for simplicity we will take only 4-dimensional spacetimes",
    "; it is of course trivial to include more `` angular '' space coordinates but concerning the perturbations they will all behave in the same way in our analysis . for both physical perturbations ( one `` radial '' and one `` angular '' ) we get schrdinger - like equations of the form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the comoving perturbation , @xmath4 is the radius of the unperturbed circular string and the string time @xmath5 plays the role of the spatial coordinate .    in section 3",
    "we analyse these equations , taking @xmath6 as a parameter . from the sign of @xmath7 we find the regions where we expect that the perturbations develop imaginary frequencies and eventually grow infinitely , in the 3 backgrounds considered . while in section 3 we only get indications of the emergence of string - instabilities , in section 4 we consider the exact time - evolution of the perturbations in the regions @xmath0 ( ring - collapse ) and @xmath1 .",
    "this provides a connection between the less strictly obtained results of section 3 and the question of bounded / unbounded perturbations .",
    "the details of our results are presented in sections 3 and 4 , and are summarized in fig.2 .",
    ":    for @xmath0 the perturbations in the direction perpendicular to the string plane are bounded in all 3 backgrounds , while the perturbations in the plane of the string grow infinitely .    for @xmath1",
    "both physical perturbations are boundeed in the case of schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes ( which is not surprising since these spacetimes are asymptotically flat ) , but unbounded in the case of de sitter spacetime .    throughout the paper we use sign - conventions of misner - thorne - wheeler @xcite and units where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the string tension @xmath10 .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the bosonic string are in the conformal gauge given by : @xmath11 where dot and prime denote derivative with respect to the string coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath12 , respectively . as usual these equations are supplemented with the 2 gauge constraints : @xmath13 in this paper we will consider perturbations around a circular string configuration embedded in schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and de sitter spacetimes",
    ". in static coordinates these spacetimes are all special cases of the line element : @xmath14 so in the first place we will keep @xmath15 as an arbitrary function .",
    "the components of the christoffel symbol and of the riemann tensor ( that we will need later ) corresponding to the metric ( 2.3 ) are listed in the appendix .",
    "let us first consider the unperturbed circular string .",
    "it is obtained by the _ ansatz _ : @xmath16 describing a circular string in the equatorial plane with only one physical mode namely the radial @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of motion and the constraints ( 2.1),(2.2 ) lead to : @xmath17 this system of equations can alternatively be formulated as a hamiltonian system : @xmath18 we can then eliminate the cyclic coordinate @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the `` energy '' of the string .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath6 is then determined by : @xmath22 that is solved by : @xmath23 by inverting this relation for @xmath4 we then obtain @xmath24 by integration of equation ( 2.7 ) .",
    "note also that the line element ( 2.3 ) is now : @xmath25 i.e. the invariant string size is given by @xmath4 .",
    "we will now consider the perturbations in the 2 physical directions normal to the string world - sheet .",
    "from the 2 tangent vectors : @xmath26 we find the 2 normal vectors : @xmath27 fulfilling the following equations : @xmath28 here @xmath29 takes the values @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "obviously @xmath33 is perpendicular to the string plane ( that is equal to the equatorial plane ) while @xmath34 is in the string plane .",
    "the general physical perturbation can then be expressed as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the comoving perturbations , i.e. the perturbations as seen by an observer travelling with the unperturbed circular string . in the following",
    "we will call these perturbations for the angular perturbation @xmath38 and the radial perturbation @xmath39 , respectively .    according to the general covariant analysis of physical perturbations propagating along strings in curved spacetimes , carried out by frolov and the author @xcite",
    ", the perturbations are determined by the following matrix equation : @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the intrinsic and induced metric , respectively , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the second fundamental form and normal fundamental form @xcite , respectively : @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spacetime covariant derivative .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the world - sheet dalambertian and covariant derivative , respectively : @xmath50 @xmath51 finally @xmath52 represents the spacetime riemann tensor .",
    "this extremely complicated system of 2 coupled linear second order partial differential equations fortunately simplifies enormously for the special cases considered here .",
    "one can show that all components of the normal fundamental form vanish , while the only non - vanishing components of the second fundamental form are : @xmath53 the non - vanishing components of the relevant projections of the riemann tensor become : @xmath54 @xmath55 finally the dalambertian reduces to ( conformal gauge ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the original system ( 2.15 ) now decouples and leads to the 2 equations : @xmath58 these equations can further be reduced to ordinary differential equations by fourier transforming the comoving perturbations : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the tilde denotes summation for @xmath61 only .",
    "the zero modes and the @xmath62 modes are excluded from the summations since they do not correspond to `` real '' perturbations on a circular string @xcite .",
    "they describe spacetime translations and rotations that do not change the shape of the string .",
    "they therefore correspond to simply `` jumping '' from one unperturbed circular string to another unperturbed circular string .",
    "we are then left with the 2 equations @xmath63 : @xmath64 until now we have kept the function @xmath65 in the line element ( 2.3 ) as an arbitrary function of @xmath6 .",
    "as announced in the abstract we will however only consider the 3 cases of schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and de sitter .",
    "these spacetimes are essentially the scalar curvature flat cases of ( 2.3 ) since , from the appendix , the condition @xmath66 is : @xmath67 that is integrated to : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants .",
    "this expression covers the cosmologically and gravitationally interesting cases of de sitter @xmath71 , schwarzschild @xmath72 as well as reissner - nordstrm @xmath73 spacetimes . in these cases ( 2.25 )",
    "leads to : @xmath74 and @xmath4 is determined by ( 2.9 ) : @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( the black hole cases ) @xmath4 is then a trigonometric function , while for @xmath77 ( de sitter case ) it is generally , but not always , elliptic .",
    "in this section we analyse the equations for the perturbations ( 2.28 ) taking @xmath6 as the parameter . both equations are schrdinger - like equations of the form @xmath78 , and we will then say that the solutions are oscillatory in time @xmath5 if @xmath7 is positive but non - oscillatory in time @xmath5 , developing imaginary frequencies , if @xmath7 is negative .",
    "we are using the words oscillatory and non - oscillatory in a weak ( and sloppy ) sense , that should not be confused with the more strict use of the words in the mathematical literature , where ( say ) oscillatory behaviour usually means that a function has infinitely many zeroes .",
    "note also that there is no simple one - to - one correspondence between oscillatory ( non - oscillatory ) and boundedness ( unboundedness ) of the solutions .",
    "this can for instance be seen from the simple example : @xmath79 in this case we would say that the solutions are oscillatory on the positive half - axis , but the general solution : @xmath80 is in fact neither oscillatory in the strict mathematical sense nor is bounded . in section 4",
    "we will see however , that in most of the cases considered here non - oscillatory behaviour of the perturbations , developing imaginary frequencies , will actually lead to unbounded solutions , indicating that the underlying unperturbed string configuration is unstable , in agreement with the string instability characterization given by loust and snchez @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed also that we are still only talking about the evolution of the comoving string - perturbations .",
    "the transformation to the perturbations as seen by an observer at rest is a highly non - trivial problem , that to our knowledge has only been done in the case of flat minkowski space @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider curved spacetimes where everything is of course somewhat more complicated .",
    "let us now consider the perturbations in the 3 cases .      in this case",
    "the unperturbed string solution is ( 2.29 ) : @xmath81 i.e. the string has its maximal radius @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",
    "it then contracts through the horizon @xmath84 for @xmath850,\\pi/2[\\;$ ] , and eventually falls into the singularity @xmath86 for @xmath87\\pi/2,\\pi[\\;$ ] .",
    "mathematically speaking it of course continues oscillating but for our purposes we only consider the proces of collapse from the maximal radius ; this somehow resembles the radial infall of a point particle .",
    "the collapse into the schwarzschild singularity of course takes infinite coordinate time .",
    "this can be explicitly seen by integrating ( 2.7 ) outside the horizon : @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "it follows that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we note in passing that the expression ( 3.2 ) is remarkably simple as compared to the corresponding relation for the radial infall of a point particle ; see for instance ref.@xcite . from the physical point of view",
    "we are mostly interested in the circular string and its perturbations outside the horizon , but considering our whole analysis as a stability analysis of some special solutions to some non - linear differential equations , there is no reason not to continue the solutions all the way through the horizon into the singularity at @xmath86 .    the equations determining the modes of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , are : @xmath94 according to the discussion at the beginning of section 3 @xmath92 is oscillatory in time for @xmath95 , i.e. the first mode ( @xmath96 ) becomes non - oscillatory at @xmath97 .",
    "the higher modes become non - oscillatory for smaller and smaller @xmath6 and for @xmath86 @xmath92 is extremely non - oscillatory ( non - oscillatory for all modes ) .",

    "@xmath92 is also oscillatory at the horizon @xmath101 while @xmath98 is oscillatory ( non - oscillatory ) at the horizon for @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .      in this case",

    "the equations determining the modes of @xmath92 and @xmath98 , respectively , are : @xmath116 formally the @xmath117-equation is identical to the @xmath117-equation in the schwarzschild case , but one should remember that in this case the charge of course is present through the expression for @xmath4 .    we now find that @xmath92 is oscillatory for all @xmath6 if @xmath118 .",

    "it may be a matter of taste whether or not to include the @xmath62 modes , but in any case we get the somewhat surprising result that the stationary circular string solution in de sitter spacetime is actually stable against `` real '' perturbations where @xmath152 .",
    "this concludes our investigations of oscillatory and non - oscillatory ( in the weak sense considered here ) behaviour of the comoving perturbations around a circular string in the 3 backgrounds of schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and de sitter spacetimes . in the next section",
    "we will relate some of these results to the question of bounded or unbounded comoving perturbations .",
    "in this section we address the question of bounded or unbounded comoving perturbations by considering the time evolution of some of the solutions found in section 3 , i.e. we now take @xmath5 as the parameter .",
    "it is clear from the general equations determining the perturbations ( 2.28 ) that we can only expect unbounded behaviour of the solutions in the 2 regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so we will restrict ourselves by considering the solutions in these regions only .",
    "it is also clear that in the 2 cases of black holes we need only consider @xmath0 since for @xmath1 ( that can of course only be obtained for @xmath153 , i.e. infinite string energy ) we have minkowski space , where the perturbations are obviously bounded ; they are just ordinary plane waves . for de sitter spacetime , on the other hand",
    ", we can get unbounded perturbations for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in all cases it will turn out that the behaviour of the perturbations in the asymptotic regions corresponds to different cases of the motion of a particle in the potential @xmath154 @xcite , in the sense that they are described by a stationary schrdinger equation with @xmath5 playing the role of the spatial parameter .",
    "it is an elementary observation that if @xmath155 and @xmath156 there are singular solutions for @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , as soon as we have obtained the potential with the 2 parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 we can conclude whether the perturbations blow up , indicating that the underlying circular string is unstable . for completeness we will however give the full solutions in the asymptotic regions , demonstrating explicitly if and how the perturbations blow up .",
    "in this case we have @xmath158 with @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath159 from below ( cf .",
    "subsection 3.1 ) .",
    "for @xmath0 we then have approximately : @xmath160 and the 2 equations determining the perturbations ( 3.3 ) become approximately : @xmath161 let us first consider the perturbations in the angular direction ( the @xmath162 s ) .",
    "keeping in mind that @xmath163 is positive in the relevant range of @xmath5 we find the 2 real independent solutions in terms of bessel functions @xcite : @xmath164 the most interesting feature of these solutions is that they are actually bounded @xcite : @xmath165 this therefore provides an example where the solutions were classified as non - oscillatory ( according to section 3.1 ) , but where the actual time evolution demonstrates that the solutions are bounded , and they are in fact oscillatory in the strict mathematical sense of having infinitely many zeroes .",
    "this is however an exceptional case ; in the other cases under consideration here we will find that non - oscillatory behaviour at @xmath0 or @xmath1 leads to unbounded solutions .",

    "the expression for @xmath178 in ( 4.10 ) is actually only the general solution provided @xmath182 . for @xmath183",
    "we find instead : @xmath184 which is however also bounded for @xmath157 .    for @xmath185 ( 4.9 )",
    "the general solution is : @xmath186 where @xmath177 are arbitrary real constants .",

    "<S> we find that the `` radial '' perturbations grow infinitely for @xmath0 ( ring - collapse ) , while the `` angular '' perturbations are bounded in this limit . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the perturbations in both physical directions ( perpendicular to the string world - sheet in 4 dimensions ) blow up in the case of de sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms results recently obtained by loust and snchez who considered perturbations around the string center of mass . </S>"
