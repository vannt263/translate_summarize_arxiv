    "the general theory of the quantum measurement of relative - phase is summarized in [ 1 ] wherein it is also shown to be equivalent to the quantum measurement of an angle about an axis ( complementary to the angular momentum along that axis ) when the relative - phase is taken to be between the `` up''and `` down '' oscillators of schwinger s harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum [ 2 ] .",
    "the quanta of schwinger s oscillators are presumably unphysical ( as they are spin-1/2 primitives which behave like bosons ) yet that model has proved useful for a variety of visualizations and calculations  including the analysis of beam splitters and interferometers in quantum optics [ 3 ] .",
    "a slight modification of schwinger s harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum permits the inclusion of photons [ 4 ] wherein the primitives become the physically realizable quanta of the right and left circular polarization modes of an electromagnetic plane wave . therein the quantum angle measurement ( equivalent to the relative - phase measurement between the two circular polarization modes ) provides novel insight on optical polarization ; including the fact that for x - polarized photon number states such angle will _ never _ correspond to the y - axis for an odd number of photons , but for an even number of photons it _ always _ can [ 1 ] , as demonstrated in fig . 1 for the cases of one , two and three x - polarized photon number states .",
    "owing to a factor of two between schwinger s model and its photonic variation [ 1,4 ] the analogy of this surprizing effect , for fermions and ordinary ( i.e. , non - photonic ) bosons , is that `` spin up can point down '' for bosons but it never does for fermions ( as demonstrated in fig . 2 for spin-1/2 , spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles ) ; wherein by `` spin up along @xmath0 '' we mean @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the eigenvalue of @xmath3 for a particle of total angular momentum labeled by @xmath4 ; and by `` point down '' we mean the angle about the z - axis , @xmath5 , is @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 corresponds to the x - axis ) .",
    "note in passing that fig .",
    "2 also demonstrates the phenomenon of `` spin up really does point up '' [ 4 ] i.e. , not only can @xmath7 occur for such states , but that is also its most likely value  in contrast to a vector model which ( prior to the establishment of the quantum angle formalism ) would attempt to _ infer _ @xmath5 from the measurement of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( rather than directly describing the _ measurement _ of @xmath5 ) .",
    "returning to the `` spin up can point down '' for bosons phenomenon : note that the angular distributions in fig .",
    "2 are also the relative - phase distributions between the two oscillators of schwinger s model . since such oscillators can also model the upward and downward paths in an interferometer the following question naturally arises .",
    "namely , can the surprizing behavior at @xmath10 in fig . 2 ( analogous to the surprizing behavior at @xmath11 in fig .",
    "1 ) be observed in a standard su(2 ) interferometer ?",
    "the answer turns out to be no .    the quantum phase representation of an su(2 )",
    "interferometer discussed herein shows that there is no inconistancy and illucidates the relationship between these two quantum measurements .",
    "it will also fascilitate the calculation of some of our results as well as provide insight on the range and sensitivity that one can expect from a quantum phase algorithm which can surpass the `` heisenberg limit '' by orders of magnitude while utilizing the simple apparatus of an su(2 ) interferometer !",
    "the transformation between linear and circular polarization basis annihilation operators follows that of their associated classical vectors : @xmath12 thus one x - polalrized photon @xmath13 is a supperposition of one right - handed ( @xmath14 ) circularly polarized photon and one left - handed ( @xmath15 ) circularly polarized photon , which have been created `` in phase '' ( which we define to mean that there is no phase shift between the creation operators which create the two modes ) i.e. , @xmath16 throughout this paper we adhere to the above definiiton of two modes being `` in phase , '' which is not to be confused with the probability of the outcome of zero when their relative - phase is measured .    to form the quantum angle representation of such a state we use the photonic primitives [ 1,4 ] ( instead of schwinger s [ 2 ] primitives ) which reflect the fact that a photon is a `` spin-1 particle with @xmath17 missing '' [ 5 ] wherein @xmath18 in general , as summarized in [ 1 ] , we can perform the quantum angle measurement via a `` snapshot '' in absolute time ( a conditional probability operator measure , which involves the addition of amplitudes associated with different @xmath4 ) or via a `` time average '' ( a marginal probability operator measure , which involves the addition of probabilities associated with different @xmath4 ) . for states with a unique value of @xmath4 however ( such as the x - polarized photon number states )",
    "both of these procedures reduce to a simple fourier transform of the complementary wavefunction @xmath19 , the magnitude square of which yeilds the quantum angle distribution , viz . , @xmath20 the quantum angle distribution of a single x - polarized photon utilizes ( 3 ) so that @xmath21 increments by two and we obtain @xmath22 ^ 2.\\ ] ] similarly , we have @xmath23 & & % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the quantum angle distribution of a two - photon x - polarized number state is @xmath24 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in general the x - polarized number states yield @xmath25 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is always an integer and @xmath21 so that the sum is from 1 when @xmath27 is odd ( in which case @xmath28 ) or from 2 when @xmath27 is even .",
    "the sum is to an upper limit of @xmath29 in increments of two ; and the coefficients are generated recursively from @xmath30 for @xmath31 with an initial condition of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for even @xmath4 ( otherwise it vanishes ) .",
    "we note that @xmath34 and we will later show how these coefficients are related to the wigner d matricies .",
    "note the generalization of `` spin-1 with @xmath17 missing '' is that @xmath35 is odd ( even ) when @xmath27 is odd ( even ) .",
    "therefore ( 8) reveals that x - polarized photon number states of an odd number have @xmath36 so that the angle will _ never _ correspond to the y - axis for such states . yet",
    "( 8) also shows that x - polarized photon number states of an even number have @xmath37 so that the angle _ always _ can correspond to the y - axis for such states .",
    "a subtle point which now bears mentioning is that the optical polarization basis transformation in ( 1 ) belongs to the u(2 ) group whereas rotations are isomorphic to su(2 ) ( where the s stands for special in that its unitary matricies also have a determinant equal to one ) .",
    "the beam splitters of section ii also belong to su(2 ) but notice we restricted our attention to only x - polarized photons in the above ( leaving the y - polarization in the vacuum state )",
    ". thus we will be able to map to analogous behavior by also restricting our attention to only single - port input excitations of the su(2 ) interferometer ( leaving the other input port in the vacuum state ) .",
    "formally , the quantum angle measurement for a state with a single value of @xmath4 , e.g. , that of a spin-@xmath4 particle , will require an additional system such as an electromagnetic field to provide a hilbert space large enough to permit wavefunction collapse ( or equivalently a desription of the measurement in terms of sets of commuting observables ) [ 1 ] .",
    "if however the field is in ( for example ) the vacuum state prior to the measurement then the single-@xmath4 , so simply presented in ( 4 ) , will manefest .",
    "to maintain an analogy with the x - polarized photon number states we now consider a spin-@xmath4 particle which is `` spin up along the x - axis , '' i.e. , a particle in the state @xmath38 where @xmath2 is the eigenvalue of @xmath3 .",
    "of course we need not employ any oscillators , but in schwinger s model these states would correspond to up / down oscillators for @xmath8 ( instead of @xmath39 ) of photon number @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( analogous to a single - port input excitation ) .",
    "we transform the @xmath42 representation into the @xmath43 representation via a @xmath44 rotation about the y - axis @xmath45 where we inserted a resolution of the identity operator , @xmath46 , on the left of the rotation operator , @xmath47 for kets without a subscript , the z - axis is implied ( as it is also implied for @xmath48 and @xmath5 throughout this paper ) . for simplicity we supressed the @xmath4 label in the kets ( and bras ) since our attention is currently on the single-@xmath4 statistics and the @xmath49 are from the well - known wigner d matrix elements : @xmath50 which can be calculated in a variety of ways [ 7 ] .",
    "the `` spin up along x '' kets have @xmath51 so the coefficients in their @xmath43 representation correspond to the first column of the wigner d matricies ( of @xmath52 ) .",
    "an explicit example will mitigate the risk of any notational confusion so let s consider spin - one ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) in the following .",
    "we have @xmath54 so that ( 4 ) yields @xmath55 ^ 2.\\ ] ] notice that the quantum angle distribution of spin-1 up along @xmath0 is related to that of the two - photon x - polarized number state as follows : @xmath56 which exemplifies how the surprizing behavior at @xmath11 illustrated in fig .",
    "1 turns into the surprizing behavior at @xmath10 illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . of course",
    ", the wigner d matricies can be calculated via schwinger s harmonic oscillator model [ 7 ] and we could have performed an analysis similar to that which led to ( 8) via schwinger s primitives instead of right and left circular polarized photons . moreover , schwinger s up / down oscillators can also model the upward / downward paths inside an su(2 ) interferometer[8 ] and the angle distribution in ( 4 ) is also the relative - phase distribution [ 1 ] between these two modes .",
    "in the quantum theory of an interferometer [ 3 ] there are many possible choices of beam splitter reference planes  which correspond to many possible choices of axies of rotation .",
    "we choose the y - axis so that the wigner d matrix elements will occur in what follows .",
    "thus , we can choose to have either the @xmath42 representation `` outside '' the beam splitters and the @xmath43 representation `` inside the interferometer '' or vice - versa .",
    "we choose the former in order to maintain similarity to the above , as well as to simplify the notation so that we wo nt need a subscript on @xmath5 since the z - axis will be implied .",
    "we also choose the first beam splitter to correspond to a rotation of @xmath57 and the second one to be of @xmath58 so that spin up will always correspond to the upward path .",
    "the transformation of the first beam splitter s input annihilation operators ( denoted with an `` a '' ) into its output annihilation operators ( denoted with a `` b '' ) follows that of @xmath59 : @xmath60    thus @xmath61 ( analogous to @xmath62 ) splits the single - port input into two `` in phase '' modes inside the interferometer ; and we create the @xmath43 representation of the input number states ( of @xmath42 representation ) in parallel with how we created the circular polarization representation of the linear polarized number states ; but this time , instead of ( 3 ) we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. , schwinger s primitives , so that each quanta is associated with a z - component angular momentum of 1/2 .",
    "notice that in ( 14 ) we changed @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 , because @xmath48 changed ) but the coefficients did not change . since we could also do that calculation via the wigner d matricies , the @xmath65 are an alternate way of calculating the same numbers as the first column of these matricies and we have @xmath66",
    "this also proves that the @xmath67 must be symmetric in @xmath48 , so their fourier transform results in terms only of the form @xmath68 and the interpretation of the surprizing effect at @xmath10 is that two modes which have been created `` in phase '' ( via an _ even _ number of creation operations ) can have a relative - phase of @xmath6 when it is measured ; yet those created via an _ odd _ number of creation operations can not . note in passing that a mode input to the @xmath69 port of this beam splitter would be split into two - modes which are created to be 180 degrees out of phase but herein we do not excite that input port , just as we did not bring the y - polarization out of the vacuum state in section ii .",
    "so we also need not concern ourselves with the difference between u(2 ) and su(2 ) , e.g. , the absence of an @xmath70 in @xmath71 as opposed to @xmath72 since we never used either of these equations ; and restricted our attention instead to @xmath61 and the analogous @xmath62 . moreover , if we excited some y - polarization ( or an input to the 180 degree splitter port ) then we would not be surprized to observe an optical polarization angle at @xmath44 ( or a relative - phase of @xmath6 ) . in the next section",
    "we derive the quantum phase representation of an su(2 ) interferometer without any restriction on its input state .",
    "after which , we will then return to the analysis of the single - port input statistics .",
    "although they correspond to quantum measurements which are realizable ( in principle ) no one , to date , has identified an apparatus which can realize the quantum phase or quantum angle measurements .",
    "interferometers are typically used to @xmath73 phase , so the question arises as to wheather or not such `` out of phase type behavior '' can be demonstrated in an su(2 ) interferometer ?",
    "the answer clearly is no , since if we phase shift the upper path by some amount @xmath74 and recombine the two via a beam splitter of reference planes associated with a rotation about @xmath75 by @xmath58 then at @xmath76 the interferometer reduces to the indentity operator  reproducing the input state at its output @xmath77 input states @xmath78 .",
    "thus , spin up at the input can never result in any photons going into the `` down port '' photodetector at the output when @xmath76  independent of the value of @xmath79 .",
    "this is not to say that such an effect can not be observed via some @xmath69 quantum measurement for which we presently have a physical realization ( e.g. , perhaps it could be observed in heterodyne or homodyne detection , etc . ) .",
    "it is instructive to explicitly demonstrate the relationship between the quantum measurement of phase and the quantum measurement realized in an su(2 ) interferometer : not only to demonstrate that there is no inconsistancy in their predictions and provide clues as to how one might modify the interferometer s apparatus in order to observe the surprizing effects above ; but also the quantum phase representation of an su(2 ) interferometer will provide novel insight as to how an interferometer works ( as did the analogies to rotations [ 3 ] ) .",
    "most importantly , it will facilitate proofs regarding the range and sensitivity one can anticipate in quantum phase statistical inference ( qpsi ) algorithms  which can yeild accuracies that are orders of magnitude better than the `` heisenberg limit , '' while utilizing the simple apparatus of an su(2 ) interferometer ( and classical signal processing that has been armed with quantum knowledge of the possible outcomes ) [ 8,9 ] .     of : m = j = 1/2 ( solid , blue ) ; m = j = 1 ( dashed , red ) ; and m = j = 3/2 ( dot - dashed , green ) .",
    "concentric gray circles deliniate steps of 20 db . ]",
    "first , there is a subtle point that we wish to clarify so that the notation is transparent to an audience wider than just the quantum optics community .",
    "recall we chose to have the @xmath42 representation `` outside '' the beam splitters and the @xmath43 representation `` inside the interferometer . '' but it would be wrong to say , for example , that with an input state of @xmath80 the state of the first beam splitter s output is @xmath81 and also utilize ( 10 ) , since that would be tantamount to performing the rotation assosicated with the input beam splitter , @xmath82 , twice .",
    "the beam splitter of course @xmath83 perform an operation on these states ( in accordance with the transformation of annihitaion operators in the heisenberg picture , as in ( 15 ) for our choice ) .",
    "the use of ( 10 ) makes it look as if we chose to use two different representations of the @xmath84 state  with its @xmath42 representation on the left of @xmath82 and its @xmath42 representation on the right of @xmath82 .",
    "the subtlety is that those are different _ spatial _ modes ( as clarified in ( 15 ) by the use of @xmath85 versus @xmath86 ) . in other words ,",
    "the upward / downward paths on the left are different spatial modes than the upward / downward paths on the right .",
    "perhaps the safest notation is to let @xmath78 represent the state at the output of the first beam splitter ( and let @xmath82 be thought of as part of the state preperation step  examples of which in the heisenberg and schrodinger pictures being given in the previous sections ) .",
    "thus , the interferometer s measurement statistics can be written as @xmath88 where      is the underlying wavefunction in measurement outcome @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 ( the eigenvalue of @xmath3 ) is 1/2 the difference of the number of photodetection events in the up / down photodetectors ( within some observation time @xmath92 ) when one imposes a differential phase shift @xmath74 between the upward and downward paths inside the interferometer  analogous to the rotation @xmath93 . for arbitrary states ( rather than those comprised of a single value of @xmath4 , such as the single - port photon number states )",
    "we could argue that the measurement outcomes from different @xmath4 are distinguishable in principle ( wheather or not we record @xmath4 ) so that in a standard interferometer we would add probabilities : @xmath94 [ 10 ] .      inserting a resolution of the identity operator in terms of the angle - kets , @xmath100 , on the left of the rotation operator in ( 17 )",
    "then yields @xmath101 now , utilizing the adjoint of ( 10 ) we have @xmath102 so that the quantum phase representation of an su(2 ) interferometer is @xmath103\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath104 are the fourier transforms of the m - th row of the wigner d matricies ( at @xmath105 ) .",
    "the @xmath104 functions represent the action of the output beam splitter and its two photodetectors ; as they project the angle - kets onto the kets of what the interferometer measures .",
    "these state - independent functions are known ( in as much as the @xmath106 are ) and the only dependence of the interferometer s measurement statistics on the quantum state of the field is via their convolution with its angle representation ( which reduces the action of the rotation operator to a simple translation of a functional argument ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the @xmath104 form a set of orthogonal functions ( for any @xmath4 ) @xmath107 so , from the orthogonality of the @xmath108 @xmath109 where the sum is over the columns of `` row m '' times `` row n '' ( and we supressed @xmath110 ) .",
    "but the n - th row of @xmath111 is also the n - th column of its inverse , hence @xmath112 ( the kronecker delta ) as asserted .",
    "when a single - port number state is input to the interferometer ( 16 ) shows that @xmath113 itself becomes @xmath114 so @xmath115 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\rightarrow & \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi } \\ s^{(j)}_{m = j}(-\\phi ) \\",
    "s^{(j)}_{m=- j}(\\phi ) % \\nonumber \\\\ % \\textit{as } \\phi & \\rightarrow & \\pi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath116 , where we used @xmath117 under a rotation by @xmath6 .",
    "orthogonality then shows that this vanishes , independent of the value of @xmath118 .",
    "thus there is no inconsistency .",
    "the state - independent behavior of the interferometer at the extremes of @xmath76 and @xmath119 can of course been seen more readily by considering it as one equivalent rotation , but now we have clues as to how we might modify the apparatus in order to reveal the behavior at @xmath10 .",
    "it is this squaring of the wigner d matrix elements which prevents the observation of such effects and we make the conjecture that instead of `` beating the signal with itself '' ( so to speak ) we should beat it with a seperate local oscillator ( as in heterodyne detection ) .",
    "an analgous conjecture would be that these effects might be observed in scattering experiments on trapped ions ( e.g. , perhaps as in raman heterodyne spectroscopy ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the use of this representation to provide insight on the range and sensitivity that one can expect from quantum phase statistical inference algorithms [ 8,9 ] .",
    "the squares of the @xmath120 turn out to be proportional to the binomial coefficients , thus we can prove that for the single - port number states we have @xmath121^{4j}$ ] . similarly we can show that @xmath122^{4 j -2 }   \\left [ \\text{sin}(\\phi /2)\\right]^{2}\\ ] ] etc . , lowering in the same fashion down to @xmath123^{4j}$ ] .",
    "closed - form expressions are useful but so are geometric interpretations .",
    "3 presents the @xmath124 versus @xmath74 for @xmath125 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath126 stems from ( 23 ) as it is the phase representation of the state convolved with itself .",
    "let @xmath127 for the moment . as @xmath48 decreases towards zero the higher frequency components in @xmath104 increase in amplitude ( because the @xmath128 get larger in absolute value ) so that their convolution with the phase representation will displace the resulting peaks further away from @xmath129 .",
    "the behavior for @xmath130 follows from a rotation by @xmath131 when we consider e.g. , a simultaneous lms fitting of these functions to measured interferometer statistics ( obtained during a fixed and unknown value of @xmath74 ) we see that the @xmath132 monotonicity of the @xmath133 on [ 0 , @xmath6 ] will resolve which side of the peaks we must be on for the other statistics ; which in turn enable decent sensitivity ( slope ) throughout this range .",
    "4 illustrates similar behavior for @xmath135 wherein we also see the increased sensitivity resulting from the use of more photons ; as well as the anticipation of good performance closer to zero and @xmath6 ( where all slopes must vanish due to symmetry ) .                        as designers of quantum measurements",
    "however one could envision a `` stroboscopic interferometer '' in which we would add the amplitudes for outcomes @xmath91 of different @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , such a measurement would be complementary to the `` snapshot '' angle measurement [ 1 ] ."
