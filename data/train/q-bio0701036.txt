    "in biological sequence analysis , probability distributions over finite ( @xmath0-dimensional ) sequences of symbols , representing nucleotides or amino acids , play a major role .",

    "a non - rna biological example is the modeling and prediction of cpg  islands in a dna sequence .",
    "a  sequence may flip between cpg and non - cpg states , with distinct hmms for generation of symbols in @xmath3 . for ease of hmm parameter estimation , and for finding the most probable parse , or path through the model ( e.g. , by the viterbi algorithm ) , the length of each cpg island and non - cpg region should be modeled in a markovian way , as the first hitting time in a finite - state markov chain .",
    "that  is , on  @xmath4 , the set of possible lengths , it should have a _ phase - type distribution _  @xcite .",
    "there is a theorem of the author s on such distributions  @xcite , which grew out of results on positively weighted _ regular _ sequences  @xcite .",
    "it says that without loss of generality , the structure of the markov chain can be greatly restricted : its ` cyclicity ' can be required to be at most  @xmath5 .",
    "this has implications for hmm parametrization .",
    "the generating function @xmath6 of a phase - type ( ph ) distribution on  @xmath7 ( which is a normalized @xmath8-weighted regular language over a @xmath0-letter alphabet ) is a _ rational _ function of  @xmath9 .",
    "going beyond regular languages to the context - free case yields an _ algebraic _ generating function : one of several variables , if each type of letter in the sequence is separately kept track  of . in rna secondary structure prediction , stochastic context - free grammars ( scfgs ) , usually in chomsky normal form , have been used  @xcite .",
    "they tend to be complicated ; if the grammar has @xmath10  non - terminal symbols , then it may have @xmath11  transition probabilities , which must be estimated from training sequences  @xcite .",
    "what is needed is a class of scfgs with ( i )  restricted internal structure , ( ii )  equivalent modeling power , and ( iii )  computationally convenient parametrization .",
    "finding such a class of models is a hard problem : even on the level of @xmath0-letter - alphabet ( i.e. , univariate ) generating functions , it involves the constructive theory of algebraic functions .    in section",
    "[ sec : algebraic ] , as a small step toward solving this problem , it is pointed  out that there is a class of probability distributions on  @xmath7 with generating functions ( i.e. , @xmath9-transforms ) that are algebraic and non - rational , which can be conveniently parametrized .",
    "this is the class of algebraic _",
    "hypergeometric distributions_. e.g. , the @xmath2-valued random variable  @xmath12 could satisfy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is gauss s ( parametrized ) hypergeometric function .",
    "if @xmath15 are suitably chosen , @xmath16 will be a probability density function with an algebraic @xmath9-transform .",
    "algebraic hypergeometric probability densities satisfy nice recurrence relations , and scfg interpretations for them can be worked  out .",
    "a more general approach toward solving the above problem , not restricted to the case of a @xmath0-letter alphabet , employs scfgs with a two - level structure . in  effect , these are scfgs wrapped around hmms .",
    "the following is an illustration .",
    "a  probabilistically weighted dyck language over the alphabet @xmath17 , i.e. , a distribution over the words in @xmath18 that comprise nested @xmath19@xmath20 pairs , is generated from a symbol  @xmath21 by repeated application of the production rule @xmath22 .",
    "the probabilities  @xmath23 sum to  @xmath0 .",
    "if each of @xmath24 in  turn represents a weighted _ regular _ language over some alphabet  @xmath25 ( e.g. ,  a ph - distribution if @xmath25  has only one letter ) , then the resulting distribution over words in  @xmath26 comes from a scfg with the stated two - level structure .",
    "this setup is familiar from ( unweighted ) language theory applied to compilation : the top - level structure of a program is specified as a word in a context - free language , and islands of low - level structure ( e.g. , identifier names and arithmetic literals ) as words in regular languages .    in section  [ sec : modeling ]",
    ", it is indicated how the idea of a scfg wrapped around hmms can be applied to rna structure prediction : initially , to the parametric stochastic modeling , in a given sequence family , of the recursive primary structure that induces secondary folding .",
    "the goal is parameter estimation and model validation , by comparison with data on real rna sequences .",
    "knudsen and hein  @xcite and nebel  @xcite have worked on this , using dyck - like languages , but stochastic modeling using distinct scfg and hmm levels is a significant advance .    on the level of primary rna structure , paired nucleotides will make  up a subsequence of the full nucleotide sequence , and must constitute a dyck word , for simplicity written as a word over  @xmath17 .",
    "a distribution over the infinite family of such dyck words is determined by the above stochastic production rule , the parameters @xmath27 in which are specific to the family being modeled .",
    "the production rule for _ full _ sequences , including unpaired nucleotides , will have not @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 on its right - hand side , but rather @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where each  @xmath36 expands to a ` run ' of unpaired nucleotides . if the four nucleotides are treated as equally likely in this context , each  @xmath36 will be a stochastic language over a @xmath0-letter alphabet , and the length of each run is reasonably modeled as having a ph - distribution .",
    "the ph class includes geometric distributions , but is more general .",
    "the overall scfg is obtained by wrapping the dyck scfg around the finite - state markov chains that yield the ph - distributions .    from a given family of rna sequences ,",
    "dyck scfg parameters can be estimated , e.g. , by the standard inside  outside algorithm  @xcite ; and then hmm parameters ( i.e. , ph - distribution parameters ) can be estimated separately . by employing a large enough class of ph - distributions ,",
    "it should be possible to produce a better fit to data on secondary structure than were obtained from the few - parameter models of knudsen and hein  @xcite and nebel  @xcite .",
    "once the family has been modeled , the most likely parse tree for any new rna sequence in the family can be computed by maximum a  posteriori estimation , using the cyk algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the sequence is predicted to have the secondary structure represented by that parse tree .",
    "since loops and bulges in rna secondary structure comprise runs of unpaired nucleotides , they can be modeled without taking long - range covariation into account .",
    "the appropriate stochastic model is an hmm _ with absorption _ , since the accurate modeling of run lengths is a goal .",
    "any such hmm will specify a probability distribution on the set of finite strings  @xmath26 , where @xmath37 is the alphabet set , and long words are exponentially unlikely .",

    "what the theorem says , since operations of types ( i),(ii),(iii ) correspond to parallel composition , serial composition , and cyclic iteration of markov chains , is that any ph - distribution arises without loss of generality from a markov chain in which cycles of states are nested at most @xmath5  deep .",
    "that  is , the chain may include cycles , and cycles within cycles , but not cycles within cycles within cycles .",
