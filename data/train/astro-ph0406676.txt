    "one of the major problems in modern cosmology is to determine the distribution of matter on large scales in the universe and understand the large scale structure ( lss ) formation .",
    "the last decade has witnessed phenomenal progress , particularly on the observational front where cmbr anisotropies ( eg . @xcite ) and galaxy redshift surveys ( eg . @xcite , 2003b ) in conjunction with other observations have determined the parameters of the background cosmological model and the power spectrum of density fluctuations to a high level of precision .",
    "these observations are all found to be consistent with a @xmath1cdm cosmological model with a scale invariant primordial power spectrum , though there are hints of what could prove to be very interesting features beyond the simplest model .",
    "another very interesting problem , on smaller scales in cosmology , is the formation of the first gravitationally bound objects and their subsequent merger to produce galaxies .",
    "observations of quasar spectra show the diffuse gas in the universe to be completely ionized at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "understanding the reionization process and its relation with the first generation of luminous objects produced by gravitational collapse is one of the challenges facing modern cosmology .",
    "observations of the redshifted 21 cm hi radiation provide an unique opportunity for probing the universe from the dark ages when the hydrogen gas first decoupled from the cmbr to the present epoch .",
    "such observations will allow us to probe in detail how the universe was reionized .",
    "in addition , redshifted hi observations will allow the large scale distribution of matter in the universe to be studies over a very wide range of redshifts .",
    "the possibility of observing 21 cm emission from the cosmological structure formation was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "later studies by @xcite and @xcite consider both emission and absorption against the cmbr .     when electrons and protons combine , for the first time , to produce hi .",
    "the subsequent era , until the formation of the first luminous objects at @xmath3 , is referred to as the dark ages or the pre - reionization era .",
    "the hi , in this era , is nearly uniformly distributed with small fluctuations which trace the dark matter .",
    "the first luminous objects reionize the hi . the reionization is initially confined to small bubbles surrounding the luminous objects .",
    "the bubbles of ionized hii gas grow until they finally overlap and the whole universe is reionized by @xmath4 .",
    "the hi distribution in the reionization era or the gray age is patchy .",
    "only the hi in dense collapsed objects survive the reionization .",
    "the surviving hi clouds which are seen as dlas in quasar absorption spectra are shown as points in the figure .",
    "the large scale distribution of these clouds is assumed to follow the dark matter . also shown",
    "is the cmbr which propagates through the intervening hi to the observer at @xmath5.,width=317 ]    the cosmological evolution of the hi gas is shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the 21 cm emission has been perceived as a very important tool for studying the epoch of reionization , and the expected signature , in 21 cm , of the heating of the hi gas and its subsequent reionization has been studied extensively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the timing , duration and character of the events which led to the reionization of the universe contains an enormous amount of information about the first cosmic structures and also has important implication for the later generations of baryonic objects .",
    "this process is not very well understood ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , but there are several relevant observational constraints .",
    "the observation of quasars at redshift @xmath6 which show strong hi absorption @xcite indicates that at least @xmath7 of the total hydrogen mass at @xmath8 is neutral @xcite , and the neutral mass fraction decreases rapidly at lower redshifts .",
    "this is a strong indication that the epoch of reionization ended at @xmath9 .",
    "observations of the cmbr polarization , generated through thomson scattering of cmbr photons by free electrons along the line of sight , indicates that the reionization began at a redshift @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed anisotropies of the cmbr indicate that the total optical depth of the thomson scattering is not extremely high , suggesting that reionization could not have started at redshift much higher than about 30 ( @xcite .",
    "a third constraint comes from determinations of the igm temperature from observations of the @xmath11 forest in the @xmath12 range @xmath13 to @xmath14 which indicates a complex reionization history with there possibly being an order unity change in the neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of observing the hi emission at @xmath16 , the post - reionization era , has also been discussed extensively particularly in the context of the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations will probe the large scale structure formation at the redshift where the hi emission originated .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed that observations of the angular fluctuations in the hi absorptions against the cmbr , originating in the @xmath12 range @xmath17 to @xmath18 corresponding to the dark age of the universe , would allow the primordial power spectrum to be probed at an unprecedented level of accuracy . @xcite",
    "have investigated this in detail including the effect of redshift space distortion and gas temperature fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the nature and the magnitude of the hi signal expected across the entire redshift range starting from the dark age of the universe at @xmath19 through the epoch of reionization to the present era .",
    "our discussion is in the context of observations using radio interferometric arrays to study the redshifted hi signal .",
    "such observations are sensitive to only the angular fluctuations in the hi signal .",
    "the quantity measured in radio interferometric observations is the complex visibility .",
    "typically , the visibilities are used to construct an image which is then analysed . an image of the hi distribution , while interesting , is not the optimal tool for quantifying and analysing the redshifted hi radiation .",
    "the quantities of interest are the statistical properties of the fluctuations in the redshifted hi radiation , and an image , if at all useful , is only an intermediate step in the process of extracting these statistical quantities . here",
    "we propose that correlations between the complex visibilities measured at different baselines and frequencies be used to directly quantify the angular and frequency domain clustering pattern in the hi radiation , completely doing away with the need for making an image .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we develop the formalism for calculating visibility correlations , bringing out the relation between this quantity and various properties of the hi distribution .",
    "the fluctuations , with angle and frequency , of the redshifted hi radiation can be directly related to fluctuations in the properties of the hi distribution in space .",
    "the mapping is a little complicated due to the presence of peculiar velocities which moves around spectral features along the frequency direction .",
    "this effect , not included in most earlier calculations , is very similar to the redshift space distortion in galaxy redshift surveys @xcite and has been included here ( also @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the possibility of using visibility correlations to study the hi distribution has been discussed earlier in the restricted context of hi emission from @xmath20 by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who have developed the formalism and used it to make detailed predictions and simulations of the signal expected at the gmrt .",
    "@xcite ( mh hereafter ) have discussed the use of visibility correlations in the context of detecting the hi signal from the epoch of reionization using lofar .",
    "they also address the issue of extracting the signal from the foreground contamination .",
    "@xcite ( zfl hereafter ) have proposed the use of the angular power spectrum to quantify the fluctuations in the redshifted hi radiation , in direct analogy with the analysis of the cmbr anisotropies , as noted by them , though this analogy is partially true in that both the redshifted hi radiation and the cmbr are background radiations present at all directions and frequencies .",
    "there is a major difference in that observations at different frequencies probe the hi at different distances whereas we expect exactly the same cmbr anisotropies at all frequencies .",
    "the multi - frequency angular power - spectrum introduced by zfl allows the cross - correlations in the angular fluctuations in the hi signal at different frequencies to be quantified .",
    "the cross correlation between the hi signal at different frequencies is expected to decay rapidly as the frequency separation is increased , and as noted by several earlier authors ( eg .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) this holds the possibility of allowing us to distinguish it from the contaminations which are expected to have a continuum spectrum and be correlated across frequencies .",
    "zfl discuss this issue focusing on the properties of the contaminants which could possibly limit the ability to extract the hi signal , and show that it should be possible to extract the signal provided point sources with flux @xmath21 can be identified and removed .",
    "in this paper we build up on the earlier work in this field .",
    "in particular , we generalize the formalism developed in @xcite so that it can be used for both , hi emission and absorption against the cmbr , thereby extending its scope to the entire redshift range starting from the epoch when hydrogen first recombines to the present .",
    "the formalism reported here presents progress over the earlier work ( mh and zfl ) on at least two counts .",
    "first , it incorporates the effects of redshift - space distortions , ignored in all earlier works except those by bharadwaj and collaborators ( mentioned earlier ) . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "this is a very important effect and not including it changes the signal by @xmath22 or more .",
    "second , our formalism shows , explicitly , how the the correlations in the hi signal decay with increasing frequency separation @xmath23 . the @xmath23 dependence ,",
    "though implicit in the formalism of mh and zfl , has not been explicitly quantified by these authors .",
    "a third point , which in our opinion is also a major advantage of our formalism over the angular power spectrum ( zfl ) , is that it deals directly with visibilities which are the primary quantity measured in radio - interferometric observations .",
    "further , the visibility correlations have a very simple relation to the three - dimensional power spectrum of hi fluctuations , the quantity of prime interest in hi observations .",
    "it may be noted that though the visibility - correlations and angular power - spectrum are equivalent descriptors of the redshifted hi observations , the former is simpler to calculate and interpret , it being related to the hi power spectrum through an exponential function instead of spherical bessel functions .",
    "we next present a brief outline of the paper . in section 3 , we trace the evolution of the cosmological hi from the dark ages to the present era , focusing on epochs which are of interest for 21 cm observations",
    ". in section 4 we present the results for the expected hi signal from the different epochs , and in section 5 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "finally , we bring to the notice of readers two recent papers @xcite and @xcite , submitted while this paper was being revised , addressing respectively the power spectrum sensitivity and the @xmath23 dependence of of the epoch of reionization hi signal .",
    "the story of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) starts at a redshift @xmath19 when , for the first time , the primeval plasma has cooled sufficiently for protons and electrons to combine .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the hi is very interesting , we shall come back to this once we have the formulas required to calculate the hi emission and absorption against the cmbr .",
    "the propagation of the cmbr , from the last scattering surface where it decouples from the primeval plasma to the observer at present , through the intervening neutral or partially ionized hydrogen is shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "along any line of sight , the cmbr interacts with the hi through the spin flip hyperfine transition at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) in the rest frame of the hydrogen .",
    "this changes the brightness temperature of the cmbr to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the optical depth , @xmath28 is the background cmbr temperature and @xmath29 is the spin temperature defined through the level population ratio @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer respectively to the number density of hydrogen atoms in the ground and excited states of the hyperfine transition , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the degeneracies of these levels and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the planck constant and @xmath37 the boltzmann constant .    the absorption / emission features introduced by the intervening hi are redshifted to a frequency @xmath38 for an observer at present .",
    "the expansion of the universe , and the hi peculiar velocity both contribute to the redshift . incorporating these effects ,",

    "also , @xmath44 is the ratio of the neutral hydrogen to the mean hydrogen density , and @xmath45 is the line of sight component of the peculiar velocity of the hi , both quantities being evaluated at a comoving position @xmath46 .",
    "the optical depth ( eq . [ eq : a3 ] ) is typically much less than unity .",
    "the quantity of interest for redshifted @xmath47 observations , the excess brightness temperature redshifted to the observer at present is @xmath48    it is convenient to express the excess brightness temperature as @xmath49 where @xmath50 depends only on @xmath12 and the background cosmological parameters , and @xmath51      \\label{eq : a6}\\ ] ] is the `` @xmath52 radiation efficiency '' @xmath53 introduced by @xcite , with the extra velocity term arising here on account of the hi peculiar velocities .",
    "we refer to @xmath54 as the `` 21 cm radiation efficiency in redshift space '' .",
    "this varies with position @xmath55 and redshift , and it incorporates the details of the hi evolution and the effects of the growth of large scale structures .",
    "we also introduce @xmath56 , the fourier transform of @xmath57 , defined through @xmath58 and the associated three dimensional power spectrum @xmath59 defined through @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the three dimensional dirac delta function .    when discussing radio interferometric observations , it is convenient to use the specific intensity @xmath62 instead of the brightness temperature . in the raleigh - jeans",

    "the crux of the issue of observing hi is in the evolution @xmath54 which is largely unknown .",
    "we shall discuss a possible scenario in the next section , before that we discuss the role of @xmath54 in radio interferometric observations .",
    "we consider radio interferometric observations using an array of low frequency radio antennas distributed on a plane .",
    "the antennas all point in the same direction @xmath68 which we take to be vertically up wards .",
    "the beam pattern @xmath69 quantifies how the individual antenna , pointing up wards , responds to signals from different directions in the sky .",
    "this is assumed to be a gaussian @xmath70 with @xmath71 _ i.e. _ the beam width of the antennas is small , and the part of the sky which contributes to the signal can be well approximated by a plane . in this approximation",
    "the unit vector @xmath39 can be represented by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a two dimensional vector in the plane of the sky . using this @xmath74",
    "can be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the components of @xmath78 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath68 .",
    "the component @xmath77 lies in the plane of the sky .",
    "the quantity measured in interferometric observations is the complex visibility @xmath79 which is recorded for every independent pair of antennas at every frequency channel in the band of observations . for any pair of antennas",
    ", @xmath80 quantifies the separation @xmath81 in units of the wavelength @xmath82 , we refer to this dimensionless quantity @xmath83 as a baseline .",
    "a typical radio interferometric array simultaneously measures visibilities at a large number of baselines and frequency channels .",
    "ideally , each visibility records a single mode of the fourier transform of the specific intensity distribution @xmath84 on the sky . in reality , it is the fourier transform of @xmath85 which is recorded    @xmath86    the measured visibilities are fourier inverted to determine the specific intensity distribution @xmath84 , which is what we call an image .",
    "usually the visibility at zero spacing @xmath87 is not used , and an uniform specific intensity distribution make no contribution to the visibilities .",
    "the visibilities record only the angular fluctuations in @xmath88 .",
    "if the specific intensity distribution on the sky were decomposed into fourier modes , ideally the visibility at a baseline @xmath83 would record the complex amplitude of only a single mode whose period is @xmath89 in angle on the sky and is oriented in the direction parallel to @xmath83 .",
    "in reality , the response to fourier modes on the sky is smeared a little because of @xmath69 , the antenna beam pattern , which appears in equation ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",
    "we now calculate the visibilities arising from angular fluctuations in the specific intensity excess ( or decrement ) @xmath90 produced by redshifted hi emission ( or absorption ) against the cmbr .",

    ", the contribution to @xmath79 from different modes is peaked around the values of @xmath78 for which @xmath96 .",
    "this is so because the visibility @xmath79 responds to angular fluctuations of period @xmath89 on the sky , which corresponds to a spatial period @xmath97 at the distance where the hi is located .",
    "it then follows that @xmath56 will contribute to a visibility @xmath79 only if the component of @xmath78 projected on the plane of the sky satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "the effect of the antenna beam pattern is to introduce a range in @xmath77 of width @xmath99 to which each visibility responds .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : a11 ] ) to calculate @xmath100 , the correlation expected between the visibilities measured at two different baselines @xmath83 and @xmath101 , at two frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath102 which are slightly different _ ie . _ @xmath103 .",
    "the change @xmath104 will cause a very small change in all the terms in eq .",

    "it then follows that visibilities at two different baselines are correlated only if @xmath110 and the visibilities at widely separated baselines are uncorrelated . to understand the nature of the visibility correlations it will suffice to restrict our analysis to @xmath111 , bearing in mind that the correlation falls off very quickly if @xmath112",
    "a further simplification is possible if we assume that @xmath113 for which we can approximate the gaussian @xmath92 with a dirac delta function using @xmath114 whereby the integrals over @xmath77 in equation ( [ eq : a14 ] ) can be evaluated .",
    "we then have @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "we expect @xmath117 to be an even function of @xmath118 .",
    "it then follows that the imaginary part of the visibility correlation is zero , and the real part is    @xmath119    considering the case @xmath120 first , we see that the visibility correlation @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath117 integrated over @xmath118 .",
    "this directly reflects the fact that a baseline @xmath83 responds to all fourier modes @xmath78 whose projection in the plane of the sky matches @xmath122 . a mode @xmath123 satisfies this condition for arbitrary values of @xmath118 which is why we have to sum up the contribution from all values of @xmath118 through the integral .",
    "further interpretation is simplified if we assume that @xmath117 is an isotropic , power law of @xmath124 _ ie .",

    "( [ eq : a17 ] ) will have a substantial value if the power spectrum falls significantly before the term @xmath132 can complete one oscillation , and the integral will vanish if the power spectrum does not fall fast enough . using the fact that the power spectrum will change by order unity when @xmath133 and that the @xmath134 term completes a full oscillation when @xmath135 , we have an estimate @xmath136 for the value of @xmath23 beyond which the visibilities become uncorrelated .",
    "the point to note is that the fall in the visibility correlation @xmath137 with increasing @xmath23 depends on the combination @xmath138 which in turn depends only on @xmath12 and the cosmological parameters .",

    "one of the salient features of our analysis is that for all the eras the visibility correlation signal from redshifted hi is maximum at small baselines . in the situation where the signal arises mainly from the large scale clustering of",
    "the hi whose distribution follows the dark matter the signal is nearly constant up to @xmath271 after which the signal falls rapidly dropping by an order of magnitude by @xmath272 .",

    "details of the reionization model aside , the baseline dependence of the visibility correlations is sensitive to size of the ionized patches and it should be possible to extract this information . also , an optimal observational strategy would preferentially sample the small baselines where the signal is largest .",
    "we next shift our attention to the correlation between the visibilities at the same baseline but at two different frequencies with separation @xmath23 .",
    "we see that the correlations fall off very fast as @xmath23 is increased .",
    "in the situation where the visibility correlation signal is from the large scale gravitational clustering of the hi the value of @xmath23 where the visibilities become uncorrelated scales as @xmath275 and it is around @xmath276 at @xmath235 at all frequencies . in the situation where the signal is from ionized patches ,",
    "the value of @xmath23 where the visibilities become uncorrelated is decided by @xmath258 and it is around @xmath277 independent of the value of @xmath128 .",

    "the latter is expected to dominate during the epoch when reionization is underway .",
    "it may be noted that the value @xmath278 quoted here is specific to the model of reionization which we have adopted .",
    "though the value is model dependent , we expect that the qualitative features discussed here should continue to hold even in a more general situation .    the main challenge in observing cosmological hi is to extract the hi signal from the various contaminants which are expected to swamp this signal .",
    "the contaminants include galactic synchrotron emission , free - free emission from ionizing halos @xcite , faint radio loud quasars @xcite and synchrotron emission from low redshift galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "fortunately , all of these foregrounds have smooth continuum spectra whose contribution varies slowly with frequency . the contribution from these contaminants to the visibilities at the same baseline but two frequencies differing by @xmath23 will remain correlated for large values of @xmath23 , whereas the contribution from the hi signal will be uncorrelated beyond something like @xmath276 or even less depending on the value of @xmath128 .",
    "it is , in principle , straightforward to fit the visibility correlation at large @xmath23 and remove any slowly varying component thereby separating the contaminants from the hi signal .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the level of visibility correlation detectable in a radio - interferometric observation .",
    "we consider an array of @xmath279 antennas , the observations lasting a time duration @xmath280 , with frequency channels of width @xmath281 spanning a total bandwidth @xmath282 .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of a finite channel width @xmath281 has not been included in our calculation which assumes infinite frequency resolution .",
    "this effect can be easily included by convolving our results for the visibility correlation with the frequency response function of a single channel .",
    "preferably , @xmath281 should be much smaller than the frequency separation at which the visibility correlation become uncorrelated .",
    "we use @xmath283 to denote the frequency separation within which the visibilities are correlated , and beyond which they become uncorrelated .",
    "noise in the a single visibility correlation is @xcite @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the system temperature and @xmath286 is the effective area of a single antenna .",
    "the noise contribution will be reduced by a factor @xmath287 if we combine @xmath288 independent samples of the visibility correlation . a possible observational strategy for a preliminary detection of the hi signal would be to combine the visibility correlations at all baselines and frequency separations where there is a reasonable amount of signal .",
