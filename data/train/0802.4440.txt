    "in a metal exhibiting superconductivity at low temperature , the amount of spin - up and spin - down electrons are equal , and the electron - phonon interaction leading to cooper pairing has a given , fixed strength .",
    "both the population of the spin - components and the electron - phonon interaction strength can not be arbitrarily tuned , and this restricts the experimental study of superconductivity to some given values in parameter space .",
    "nevertheless one would like to access a much larger region of parameter space to gain insight in pairing and the superconductivity .",
    "superfluid fermi gases have recently gained a lot of interest , precisely because of the accurate adaptability of the system parameters .",
    "the interaction strength between the two hyperfine spin states is an adjustable parameter .",
    "this allows to probe pairing and superfluidity in the crossover between a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of weakly bound cooper pairs and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of tightly bound molecules @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a mixture of two hyperfine spin states of a fermionic element , the amount of each hyperfine spin component can be controlled experimentally .",
    "this permits to investigate the effect that a population imbalance between the spin components has on pairing @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , these recent experimental breakthroughs @xcite have relaunched the theoretical efforts to understand imbalanced fermi superfluids in the crossover regime @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical study of cooper pairing in an imbalanced fermi mixture was performed in the context of bcs superconductors by clogston @xcite , who showed that a population imbalance destroys the superconductivity when the imbalance in chemical potentials is of the same order as the ` balanced ' order parameter .",
    "experiments confirm that imbalance frustrates pairing , and reveal that the excess spin component is preferentially expelled from the superfluid @xcite : demixing occurs @xcite .",
    "more exotic pairing scenarios have been predicted , most notoriously the ` fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ' scenario @xcite in which the fermi spheres of the two components spontaneously deform , leading to cooper pairs with nonzero center - of - mass momentum .    when the temperature is raised and excitations are populated , the superconductivity may be restored by creating a ` balanced ' pair condensate with an ` imbalanced ' gas of excitations .",
    "this may lead to ` reentrant superconductivity ' as proposed by sarma @xcite . in the sarma state",
    ", the excess spin component is expelled from the superfluid , not in position space , but in energy space .    in the context of the sarma state , the case of an imbalanced fermi gas with a @xmath1-wave order parameter is particularly interesting . in the current experiments on superfluid fermi gases ,",
    "the temperatures are low enough so that only the @xmath0-wave partial wave matters , and the @xmath1-wave scattering is much weaker than the @xmath0-wave interactions . however , the @xmath1-wave order parameter has directions in momentum space where it vanishes , even at zero temperature .",
    "this allows for a sarma scenario where the excess spin component is expelled from the superfluid , not in position or energy space , but in momentum space . in this contribution",
    ", we show that @xmath1-wave symmetry enables the superfluid to cope with imbalance all the way to temperature zero , using a similar scenario as proposed by sarma for nonzero temperature .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that imbalance can stabilize the @xmath1-wave pairs with respect to the @xmath0-wave pairs since the @xmath1-wave superfluid is more robust against population imbalance .",
    "moreover , since also the @xmath1-wave scattering length can be tuned through the feshbach mechanism , we investigate the @xmath1-wave superfluidity both in bec and bcs regimes .",
    "the case of the @xmath1-wave pairing in the bec / bcs crossover is also interesting from the point of view of high - temperature superconductivity@xcite , where the order parameter is found to exhibit @xmath1-wave symmetry@xcite .",
    "the current results , derived in the context of cold atomic gases , can also shed light on properties of the pseudogap state in the underdoped regime .",
    "this pseudogap ( which appears to have the same @xmath1-wave symmetry as the order parameter@xcite ) has been associated either with some competing order parameter in the normal state , or with the existence of `` pre - formed pairs'',@xcite where a notable candidate is the non - condensed bipolaron@xcite .",
    "also in the current treatment , pre - formed @xmath1-wave pairs appear , and we present results for the pair binding energy of these objects as a function of temperature , density and interatomic interaction strength .",
    "our formalism of choice to treat the imbalanced fermi gases is path - integration .",
    "the path - integral formalism was effectively applied to study fermionic superfluidity in dilute gases using the approach with the hubbard - stratonovic transformation , choosing a saddle point , and performing the integration over the fermionic variables .",
    "this leaves an effective action depending on the saddle point value and the chemical potential .",
    "the effective action can be applied to study the fermi superfluid in optical lattices @xcite or to investigate vortices in fermi superfluids @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , that approach was extended in order to take into account the fluctuations around the saddle point .",
    "the treatment starts from the partition function , which is the path integral over fermionic ( grassmann ) variables .",
    "after the introducing the auxiliary bosonic variables and integrating over the fermionic variables , the exact expression for the partition function from @xcite is the path integral over only the boson fields with an effective bosonic action . that action is then represented as a sum of the saddle - point contribution ( which is calculated exactly ) and the contribution due to gaussian fluctuations , which is taken into account as a perturbation . at @xmath4 , this approximation for the fluctuations",
    "is equivalent to that of nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite .",

    "near the unitarity limit where mean - field is known to fail it is necessary to include fluctuations , but also to incorporate the normal - state interactions in the description .",

    "firstly , for the @xmath1-wave interaction the @xmath140-axis is a function of @xmath141 in stead of @xmath142 .",

    "also the scale of the y - axis in the graph ( representing @xmath144 has this dependence on the details of the potential embodied in @xmath145 .",
    "a second difference between @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave resonant pairing , is that for @xmath0-wave interactions we find that there is pairing for all values of @xmath146 . for @xmath1-wave interactions ,",
    "it is no longer true that for any attractive potential there is pairing .",
    "there needs to be a fatal attraction before pairing occurs on the bcs side .",
    "the bec side , however , is more or less the same for @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave .",
    "deep in the bec regime it indeed should not matter whether we have @xmath0-wave or @xmath1-wave internal parameter .",
    "a third difference , is that the @xmath1-wave order parameter on the bcs side is much more robust to imbalance than the @xmath0-wave order parameter . for all negative scattering lengths ,",
    "there exists a critical imbalance that destroys superfluidity in the @xmath0-wave system .",
    "however , in the @xmath1-wave case , there is a range of negative scattering lengths for which the pairs remain bound up to the maximal imbalance .",
    "this confirms our intuition that the excess spin component can be nicely stowed away in the minima of the gap , near the @xmath147 point . at these points ,",
    "the gap vanishes naturally and it does not cost any energy to make excitations or to store broken pairs .",
    "the @xmath1-wave order parameter shows similarity to the @xmath0-wave when some imbalance already present ( the @xmath148 curve looks like the @xmath0-wave curve for nonzero imbalance ) , but it is much more robust to imbalance .",
    "one can imagine increasing imbalance in such a way that it suppresses the @xmath0-wave pairing channel and still allows the @xmath1-wave pairing channel .",
    "at finite temperatures , both phase fluctuations and amplitude fluctuations in @xmath94 are important .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations dominate the thermodynamics in the bcs regime , whereas the phase fluctuations dominate in the bec regime .",

    "@xcite for the @xmath0-wave case .",
    "indeed we expect in the deep bec  limit the details of the internal structure of the molecule to be of secondary importance .",
    "compared to the case of the @xmath0-wave scattering @xcite , the dependence @xmath159 for the @xmath1-wave scattering has a broad plateau around the point @xmath156 both for the saddle - point results and for those taking into account the fluctuations .",
    "this plateau is explained by the fact that the factor @xmath151 enters the gap and number equations through its fifth power , @xmath141 , which varies very slowly as compared to the case of the @xmath0-wave scattering in the unitarity region .",
    "another difference with the @xmath0-wave case is that there is a critical value of @xmath136 so that both @xmath3 and @xmath2 turn to zero .",
    "this means a minimum strength of the attraction is necessary to achieve pairing in the @xmath1-wave , whereas in the @xmath0-wave case for all values of the ( negative ) scattering length one has pairing .",
    "as the bec limit is approached , @xmath3 strongly increases , while @xmath2 tends to a constant value .",

    "this behavior of @xmath2 shows that at @xmath160 , 5 and 3 , the anti - crossing of bcs and bec regimes occurs at @xmath164 , and that with decreasing @xmath143 , the region of the anti - crossing of bcs and bec regimes shifts to lower values of the inverse scattering length .",

    "this allows to interpret , in the case of @xmath1-wave scattering , the value @xmath183 as the boundary between the regimes of the bcs - pairing ( for @xmath181 ) and the bec - pairing ( for @xmath182 ) .",

    "the regular part of @xmath129 is negligibly small with respect to the main contribution due to the aforesaid isolated pole , which describes the bec pairing .",
    "a first point to discuss , is the predicament of mean - field theory in the unitarity limit , @xmath193 .",
    "it is crucial that fluctuations are taken into account , as we have done in the previous section .",
    "higher - order fluctuation contributions can be taken into account , and many different approaches were developed for the balanced @xmath0-wave fermi superfluid .",
    "these approaches differ in the types of higher - order processes they take into account .",
    "strinati and co - workers @xcite work diagrammatically to improve on the results obtained by nozires and schmitt - rink for @xmath4 . levin and co - workers",
    "@xcite construct a finite temperature theory similar to that of strinati and co - workers but include different diagrams in the summation .",
    "alternatively , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite can be used to obtain results on the crossover physics the balanced @xmath0-wave fermi superfluid and put the crossover theories to the test . at the unitarity limit",
    "the existing theories do not succeed to find the free energy of the system with more than 10% accuracy with respect to the monte carlo results .",
    "as such , we expect the current theory to have a similar level of accuracy in the unitarity limit for the @xmath1-wave system .",
    "the problem that lies at the root of the difficulty to make a theory for unitarity is that one needs to take into account not only the fluctuations of the order parameter but also the normal - state interactions correctly .",
    "the diagrammatic approaches @xcite are based on a zeroth - order decoupling that emphasizes pair formation rather than normal - state interactions . put in the language of functional integration@xcite",
    ", we have made a particular choice for the hubbard - stratonovic decoupling : we took @xmath194 and @xmath195 types of products of grassmann variables .",
    "this emphasizes pairing , but when the pairing goes to zero at the saddle - point , the resulting normal state has no interactions , and fluctuation corrections are needed to remedy this .",
    "we could have made the choice to group @xmath196 and @xmath196 and apply the hubbard - stratonovic scheme to decouple the four - product in these densities rather than in the pairs .",
    "the resulting saddle - point approximation would yield the random phase approximation ( rpa ) results for the interacting normal state ; but it would lack pairing . the inability to include on the level of a saddle - point approximation both pairing and rpa normal - state interactions through the introduction of two collective fields",
    "is discussed by kleinert @xcite , who proposes variational perturbation theory as a solution@xcite .",
    "the fluctuation expansion used in the current work goes beyond that of ref.@xcite , in that we take not only the particle - pair @xmath194 and hole - pair @xmath195 excitations , but also particle - hole terms @xmath196 are present .",
    "these contributions appear in terms that do not vanish as the saddle point goes to zero , @xmath197 , so that the normal state in the present treatment is the interacting fermi gas rather than the ideal fermi gas . as such",
    ", the present treatment will be better suited in the unitary limit .      magnetically tuning the population imbalance in a fermi superfluid is out of reach at present in high - temperature superconductors . in cold atomic gases",
    "it has been successfully demonstrated and applied to reach the superfluid regime .",
    "the currently realized atomic fermi superfluids have @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the @xmath1-wave coupling strength generally is too small to dominate the @xmath0-wave scattering at low temperature .",
    "this can be overcome using a feshbach resonance in the @xmath1-wave scattering channel .",
    "@xmath1-wave feshbach resonances have been observed , for example , in various isotopes of rubidium@xcite .",
    "however , to reach the unitary limit for the @xmath1-wave scattering one needs a better control over the magnetic field than in the @xmath0-wave case , since the interaction parameter @xmath198 expression ( [ lambda ] ) , scales as @xmath199 as compared to @xmath200 .",
    "the current results suggest a different route towards @xmath1-wave superfluidity : imbalancing the gas .",
    "the dominant @xmath0-wave pairing is easily suppressed on the bcs side of the resonance by adding imbalance , whereas @xmath1-wave superfluidity is less sensitive to imbalance .",
    "both the use of a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance to obtain a large enough @xmath1-wave coupling strength , and of imbalance to suppress @xmath0-wave pairing , will be needed to realize @xmath1-wave superfluidity in the atomic gases .    in an inhomogneous trapping potential , phase separation can occur in real space .",
    "for @xmath0-wave superfluidity , this leads to a balanced superfluid at the center of the trap , surrounded by a halo of imbalanced ( or fully polarized ) normal gas @xcite . in effect",
    ", the excess spin component has been expelled from the balanced @xmath0-wave superfluid .",
    "the additional energy cost of placing the excess atoms fhigher up the trapping potential is compensated by the energy gained by allowing the balanced superfluid state to form . in the @xmath1-wave superfluid",
    ", this energy balance is different .",
    "increasing imbalance in the bcs side does not strongly reduce the free energy of the superfluid . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the @xmath1-wave order parameter is not strongly affected .",
    "therefore , expelling the excess atoms to the edge of the trap raises the total energy and we do not expect real - space phase separation .",
    "the situation is different on the bec side : here , the free energy of the @xmath1-wave superfluid is reduced by imbalance , and it becomes energetically favourable to expell excess atoms .",
    "note that the action for the fluctuations depends ( through @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) on the choice of saddle point @xmath94 .",
    "this means that the spectrum of excitations ( obtained from the diagonalized fluctuation action ) also depends on the choice of the saddle point .",
    "excitations for a vortex condensate may be different from excitations on top of a ground - state condensate . at nonzero temperature",
    "those excitations will be populated through bose statistics .",
    "but the physics is more complex than just bose populating excitations : the excitation spectrum itself ( the dispersion and lifetime of those excitations ) is temperature dependent : new single - particle and collective modes appear and shift as a function of temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the only single - particle excitations are @xmath203 , the energy spectrum for breaking a cooper pair , but at finite temperature , we also have the excitations of the thermal gas . these consist in taking the atoms of a broken cooper pair , and giving those atoms an extra kick : @xmath204 . besides those single - particle excitations",
    ", we will have collective excitations whenever @xmath205 .    in the case of an imbalanced fermi gas ,",
    "an alternative choice for the saddle point is @xmath206 where * k * represent a shortest wave vector connecting the fermi surface of the minority component to that of the majority component .",
    "the resulting equations describe the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state @xcite .",
    "however , this state has not yet been reported experimentally , so we have restricted the present analysis to the usual pairing scenario .",
    "we have investigated the imbalanced _",
    "d_-wave fermi gas , both at zero and at nonzero temperatures , and as a function of the @xmath1-wave interaction strength .",
    "we find that in the bcs regime , the @xmath1-wave pairing is more robust to the presence of population imbalance than the @xmath0-wave case . for a range of interaction strengths , we find that the @xmath0-wave superfluidity is suppressed whereas the @xmath1-wave superfluidity is not .",
    "this is shown to be related to the possibility of creating a polarized gas of excitations in the nodes of the gap .",
    "rather than phase separation in real space , phase separation can occur in reciprocal space .",
    "an additional difference with the @xmath0-wave bcs case , is that a critical attraction strength is needed in the @xmath1-wave case before pairing can occur ( in @xmath0-wave pairing occurs for all attractive interaction strengths ) . in the bec  regime ,",
    "the symmetry of the pairing interaction plays a less important role : as the molecule gets more tightly bound , the details of its internal wave function matter less , and we retrieve known results for the @xmath0-wave system in the same bec  limit@xcite .",
    "we then investigate how our results are affected by gaussian fluctuations , important both to describe the nonzero - temperature thermodynamics .",
    "both the critical temperature and the effect of temperature on the spectral density of the excitations are calculated .",
    "our investigation of the structure factor reveals that for the @xmath1-wave scattering , the damping of the pole for @xmath129 is very small even in the bcs regime , in contrast to that for the @xmath0-wave scattering .",
    "the critical temperature in the bcs regime reflects the pair binding energy .",
