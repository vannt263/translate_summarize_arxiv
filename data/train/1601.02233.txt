    "in this work we shall study entanglement conditions for bright multi - mode quantum optical fields of undefined intensities ( essentially , photon numbers ) .",
    "the experiments which we study involve pairs of spatially separated multi - port beam - splitter interferometers , of the kind studied in @xcite .",
    "multi - port techniques were tested by walker @xcite .",
    "ideas concerning their use to observe effects related with higher dimensional entanglement one can find in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the multi - port interferometers can perform any unitary transformations of finite dimensional single photon states was shown by reck _",
    "_ @xcite . in 2000",
    ", it was shown that two - photon higher dimensional entanglement leads to stronger violation of local realism than two - qubit one ( numerical results of @xcite , confirmed analytically in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "also , two - particle higher dimensional entanglement has specific traits which are not present in qubit systems @xcite .    the work of reck _",
    "provides a blueprint for any finite dimensional unitary transformations of single photon states .",
    "the transformations are produced with the use of passive optical devices : beam splitters and phase shifters .",
    "such multi - port devices give optical modes coupling which also leads to a unitary relation between the input and output modes .",
    "if single photon state is of a photon which is in ( mode ) beam @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath1 , and the modes are fully distinguishable ( i.e. , the states form an orthonormal basis ) , and the unitary transformation describing the action of the multi - port is @xmath2 , then the photon creation operator describing the modes transforms according to @xmath3 note that the basis property of the considered single photon state implies the following commutation relations @xmath4=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath5=0 $ ] .",
    "identical relations also hold for the ` out ' operators .",
    "such devices in principle allow to experimentally / operationally test basic single and two ( three ,  , etc . )",
    "particles quantum physics and quantum information processes via interference experiments , see e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we want to study the extensions of such experiments to the second quantized optical fields , having in mind especially states of light with undefined photon numbers .",
    "we investigate non - separability criteria . as an exemplary family of the entangled quantum optical states",
    "we shall take the ( multi - mode ) bright squeezed vacuum .",
    "such states have in theory perfect epr correlations .",
    "we shall show this can be extended to the multi - mode cases . using",
    "this property one can derive entanglement conditions , as separable states can not have epr correlations .",
    "such conditions were given for the case of four - mode squeezed vacuum in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "they are in the form on conditions for correlations of standard polarization measurements , that is for stokes parameters .",
    "however , one can reach more sensitive conditions by replacing the stokes parameters by ensemble averaged polarization measurements ( essentially , in each run we measure the ratios of intensities at the exits of polarization analyzers and then take their averages , see below ) @xcite . in the case of polarization correlation measurements",
    "such an approach has an advantage .",
    "the older approach based on the stokes parameters is giving correlation functions which are averages effectively weighted by ( fluctuating ) intensities .",
    "the approach of @xcite allows straightforward quantum mechanical averages of polarization correlation readouts over the ensemble of equivalently prepared runs .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend such an approach to number of local modes higher than two , and to study basic consequences of such an approach .    with the ongoing improvements in parametric down - conversion techniques , the birth of integrated optics , and laser imprinting methods to build such devices , the multi - port interferometry experiments , such as those suggested in @xcite , are becoming feasible . as a matter of fact",
    ", important tests of exactly such configurations were recently done , see schaeff _",
    "the schemes discussed here are involving parametric down - conversion for higher pump powers , in the case of which we do not have essentially emissions of pairs of correlated photons , but superpositions of multi - pair emissions . therefore new phenomena need to be studied .",
    "at least one should check to what extent the features of two - photon correlations are still present in the case of stronger fields .",
    "we shall consider sets of local interferometers , which are effectively unbiased multi - port beam - splitters @xcite , which in the case of single photons allow transformations to full sets of mutually unbiased unbiased state bases . because of the known problems ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) concerning sets of unbiased bases we shall consider only situations in which the number of local modes , @xmath7 , is a prime .",
    "even for @xmath7 which is a power of a prime , the algebraic proofs are quite cumbersome , and such cases will studied in forthcoming papers .",
    "as a by - product of our considerations we shall also get complementarity relations for multi - port interferometry of general quantum optical fields .",
    "we shall see that many of the traits of complementarity relations for single particle multi - port measurements still hold for fields of undefined photon numbers . if one replaces intensities at the outputs of such devices by rates ( ratios between the observed intensity at the given output divided by the total intensity ) , such relations are quite elegant .",
    "the other implication of our results is that they undermine the usual paradigm that the quantum coherence properties of optical fields can be revealed by intensity correlation functions , see _ any _ textbook of quantum optics .",
    "the results presented here show that , in the case in which one can use correlations between rates , instead of the usual intensity correlations , one often gains in the visibility of non - classical phenomena .",
    "this finding will be additionally supported in forthcoming publications .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , a new stokes operator to characterize the polarization of quantum light was introduced .",
    "the redefined stokes operators allow one to derive new kinds of bell inequalities which show strong violations for the four - mode bright squeezed vacuum ( bsv ) state .",
    "one can also derive new entanglement witnesses / indicators which detect entanglement for the states and situations in which the traditional approach , like in @xcite , fails .",
    "the results of @xcite are for the measurements of three mutually unbiased , complementary polarizations : e.g. , horizontal / vertical , diagonal / anti - diagonal and circular right / left handed . here",
    ", we shall derive generalizations of such entanglement conditions for the multi - mode cases .",
    "the construction of entanglement indicators of @xcite and @xcite takes as its starting point the fact that for the four - mode bsv one can observe perfect epr correlations ( in many pairs of polarization measurements bases ) , and that separable states do not have this property",
    ". they can be only classically correlated .",
    "the optimal choice is to use three mutually unbiased , complementary polarization measurement settings .    here , as our starting point we take multi - mode emissions in the down - conversion process @xcite .",
    "the emissions from the parametric down - conversion source are directionally correlated due to the phase matching conditions . in the type - i",
    "parametric down - conversion , the pairs of photons of the same frequency are emitted into a cone , in such a way that one can register coincidences into pairs of directions along the cone which lay in the same plane as the pump field , for details see @xcite .",
    "one can select in principle an arbitrary number of such pairs of such directions , and collect their radiations .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian which describes such an arrangement has the following form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation operators of @xmath0th signal - idler mode pair , and @xmath11 is a coupling constant proportional to the pumping power .",
    "the modes @xmath12 are directed ( via optical fibers , etc . ) to a detection station ` alice ' , while modes @xmath13 to ` bob ' .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian can be put in the followings form : @xmath14 if one takes a @xmath15 unitary matrix @xmath16 , one has @xmath17 .",
    "further if one defines @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , then one can transform it to an equivalent form : @xmath20 this symmetry of @xmath21 implies an invariance of the perfect epr correlations .",
    "such a transformation can be done using a specific pairs of ` conjugate ' multi - port interferometers , one for alice one for bob . in other words ,",
    "as the squeezed vacuum state resulting from the application of hamiltonian @xmath21 on initial vacuum reveals perfect correlations , such correlations also occur after the pair of local conjugate mode transformations .",
    "notice that one can consider the @xmath16 transformations matrices of modes which are associated with unitary transformations leading to unbiased bases for a @xmath7-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this is what we shall do .",
    "however to avoid technical problems we shall consider only @xmath7 which are prime numbers ( see introduction ) .",
    "consider @xmath22 . for three paris of schmidt modes ,",
    "the emitted photon pairs are prepared in the following entangled state : @xmath23 where @xmath24 here , the sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative integers @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 describes ` gain ' and is dependent on @xmath11 and the interaction time ( basically equal the length of the non - linear crystal divided by the speed of light ) .",
    "our measurement devices consist of an unbiased symmetric multi - port beam - splitter @xcite and detectors behind the beam splitters .",
    "the unbiased multi - port beam - splitter is defined as an @xmath7-input and @xmath7-output interferometric device , of the property that light entering via only a single port is split to all output ports , @xmath28 of the intensity into each exit . following the one photon case",
    "@xcite one can relate with each exit @xmath7th complex roots of unity , values @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the three - output case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : state_d3 ] .",
    "however , as we shall see , this is not a necessary technical tool , and the experience of the authors suggests that such an approach is not optimal , in terms of calculations , for @xmath31 .",
    "still , it will be presented here , as it gives a direct generalization of the conditions in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    ) , the six - mode bright squeezed vacuum state ( [ eq : bsv ] ) is generated .",
    "this entangled state has the perfect epr correlations between the local conjugate modes .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "we shall study here the approach which uses specific value assignment as in fig .",
    "[ fig : state_d3 ] ( see @xcite ) . consider four unitary transformations which lead to the unbiased ( complementary ) bases in a @xmath32-dimensional hilbert space ( note that when the dimension @xmath7 of a hilbert space is an integer power of a prime number , the number of mutually unbiased bases is @xmath33 @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath34 , while the other three , indexed with @xmath35 , have matrix elements which lead to the following transformations of the bases @xcite : @xmath36 with such transformations one can relate a multi - port beam - splitter ( interferometer ) which couples the input beams the creation operators , @xmath37 , with the output ones , @xmath38 in the following way : @xmath39 and we define @xmath40 . as our observables we shall define , for each or the four complementary ( local ) situations @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , is a photon number operator of @xmath45th mode , and @xmath46 .",
    "the symbol @xmath47 stands for the operator of the total number of photons ( it is invariant with respect to unitary mode couplings ) .",
    "finally , we have @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a vacuum state .",
    "thanks to this the operator @xmath50 acts only in the non - vacuum part of the fock space of photons .",
    "this trick makes the operator @xmath51 properly defined .",
    "as the squeezed vacuum state has epr correlations in measured numbers of photons , one has @xmath52 where indices @xmath53 denote measurements of alice and bob , respectively .",
    "we will show that any separable states can not hold the condition ( [ eq : zero_cond ] ) . to this end , we use the following two formulas . in appendix",
    "[ apx : derivation ] , we show the following operator relation @xmath54 while in appendix b we also show that for any separable states @xmath55 @xmath56 then , one can show that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an expectation for the reduced state @xmath59 of a subsystem @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , for three modes we have a _ necessary _ condition for a state to be separable , it reads @xmath61 it is easy to check that analog conditions involving photon numbers rather than rates read : @xmath62 where @xmath63 this is a generalization of the conditions of @xcite to @xmath22 .",
    "we shall not follow this approach for higher @xmath7 , as a more general one , without the application of a specific measurement value assignment ( i.e. , the powers of @xmath64 ) , allows one in a simple way to get results for an arbitrary prime @xmath7 .",
    "we will show the alternative approach in the next section .",
    "in appendix c we give an analysis of noise resistance of the above entanglement criteria .",
    "this is given for our ` reference ' state , the bright squeezed ( six - mode ) vacuum .",
    "the considered noise is the one for photon losses .",
    "we assume that all detectors in the two multi - port experiment of fig .",
    "[ fig : state_d3 ] are of a finite efficiency .",
    "the critical efficiencies for the two conditions are very interesting .    for the criterion ( [ intensities ] ) based on photon numbers rather than the rates ,",
    "we obtain requirement of @xmath65 , for _ all _ values of @xmath27 .",
    "notice that it is a very telling result .",
    "it means that , with even ideal detections we can not get an experiment revealing entanglement of bright squeezed vacuum by splitting the radiation of the source on both sides into four directions ( each beam ) and then directing each of the branches to four pairs of conjugate complementary interferometers , see fig .  [ fig : d3_comp ] ( if this is unclear for the reader , please note that in the @xmath66 case of polarized beams , as considered in @xcite an equivalent arrangement would be to split the beam leading say to alice into three of identical intensities , and measuring in each of the three beams , or branches , three fully complementary polarizations , and a similar action on bob s side ) . such splitting , if one recalls the rule that a passive optical device can be permuted ( if this does not lead to a different interferometric setup ) , acts in each branch in the same way as if the detection efficiency in the branch is @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we see that the intensity based criterion even for perfect efficiency inherits the usual complementarity features of single photon experiments .",
    "if one tries to make simultaneously measurements in _ all _ full complementary situations , the entanglement criterion is worthless .",
    "however , this is not so for the criterion based on the rates ( [ eq : ent_cond ] ) .",
    "for a very low gain @xmath27 the critical efficiency is by a whisker below @xmath67 ( this is reflecting the fact that the experiment in such a regime is effectively a two - photon one , and standard bohrian complementarity applies ) .",
    "but for very high @xmath27 one has @xmath68 , as a matter of fact it can be as low as @xmath69 . thus we have not only a better resistance to losses , but additionally , in principle we can detect entanglement of very bright squeezed vacuum by beam - splitting its radiation to each side into four channels and making all the measurements at the same time .",
    "the arrangements are not entirely complementary anymore .",
    "this hints that with the use of the rates we are probing deeper into the nature of multi - photon light",
    ".     of the  intensity  always goes to each branch .",
    "we have the following four branches : t - t ( two transmissions ) , t - r ( transmission first then reflection ) , r - t ( refection then transmission ) , and r - r ( two reflections ) .",
    "all three t - t branches ( each from a different original beam ) are fed into the interferometer @xmath70 which realizes ( for single photons ) mutually unbiased basis number one ( mub1 ) .",
    "all three t - r branches ( each from a different original beam ) are fed into the interferometer @xmath71 which realizes ( for single photons ) mub2 .",
    "all three r - t branches ( each from a different original beam ) are fed into the interferometer which realizes ( for single photons ) mub3 .",
    "all three r - r branches ( each from a different original beam ) are fed into the interferometer which realizes ( for single photons ) mub4 .",
    "thus , for perfect detectors , @xmath72 efficient , counts at conjugated mub@xmath0 s @xmath73 at alice s and bob s side ( the same `` @xmath0 '' on both sides ) , are identical as if there was just one pair of mub@xmath0 s ( of the same `` @xmath0 '' ) , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : state_d3 ] , and as if the efficiency of detection was 1/4 . only correlations for ( all )",
    "pairs conjugated interferometers of alice and bob are taken into account .",
    "thus all measurements in all pairs of conjugated bases , considered in the main text , can be done simultaneously , at the price of having a lower effective efficiency .",
