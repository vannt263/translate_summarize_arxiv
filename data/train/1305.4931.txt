    "we include a cell ( de-)refinement scheme  @xcite which enforces that all cells remain within a factor of two of a specified target mass so that the total number of baryonic elements in our simulations ( star particles and gas cells ) remains close to its initial value .",

    "a more detailed link between observed galaxies and their host dark matter haloes has been established along with an understanding of how galaxies and their host haloes evolve together in time . in particular ,",
    "one of the central results from these models is a parameterised relationship describing the evolution of the stellar mass to halo mass ( smhm ) ratio as a function of galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "comparing directly to abundance matching results  rather than using just the gsmf comparison in the previous section  has the added advantage that abundance matching models account for the asymmetric impact of observational errors on the stellar mass functions , while also inferring additional galaxy properties such as their star formation rates .",
    "it has been shown in paper i that the feedback physics included in our simulations produces a reasonable match to the abundance matching derived smhm relationship at redshift @xmath0 by reducing the efficiency of star formation in low mass and high mass haloes through efficient stellar and agn feedback . here",
    ", we focus on the evolution of the smhm ratios for the simulated galaxies compared against the abundance matching models of  @xcite and  @xcite at several redshifts , as well as  @xcite at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : smhm ] shows the simulated galaxy stellar mass vs. halo mass relation for three different redshifts .",
    "the solid lines indicate the median smhm relation as a function of simulation resolution ( top panel ) and feedback model ( bottom panel ) . in each figure , we show a two - dimensional histogram indicating the full distribution of simulated galaxies for the `` l25n256 '' simulation ( bottom panel ) and `` l25n512 '' simulation ( top panel ) .",
    "in the low mass regime at redshift @xmath0 , most of the feedback models yield smhm relations clustered around the abundance matching results .",
    "the spread in these models can be attributed to changes in the adopted wind model , as discussed in paper i. briefly , we note that the `` strong '' wind model suppresses star formation in low mass systems too efficiently , leading to an underestimate of the smhm relation .",
    "conversely , the `` weak '' wind simulation overproduces stars in these same systems .",
    "as we consider these relations at higher redshift , a similar trend remains true . at redshifts @xmath24 and @xmath25 the `` weak '' wind and `` strong '' wind models bracket the abundance matching smhm relation , with approximately the correct slope .",
    "the fiducial feedback model , which falls between these two cases , is in approximate agreement with the abundance matching results ( although the slope may be somewhat steeper at redshift @xmath25 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for high mass systems at redshifts @xmath24 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the relationship between the abundance matching smhm relation and the simulation result is heavily dependent on the adopted agn feedback model .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the location of the knee of the smhm relation is set by the adopted agn radio threshold ; i.e. a high radio threshold pushes the knee location to lower masses .",
    "the adopted radio threshold value was set to get the redshift @xmath0 smhm relation knee in the right location .",
    "the same trend can be observed at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "notably , the high and low radio threshold values bracket the desired location of the smhm relation knee .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : smhm ] shows the resolution dependence of the simulated smhm relation using our fiducial feedback model .",
    "while the redshift @xmath25 smhm relation is converged for the intermediate and high resolution simulation , the lowest mass systems show an offset between these two runs at redshift @xmath24 which becomes more pronounced by redshift @xmath0 .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath26 offset in the stellar masses of the intermediate and high resolution runs for low mass systems at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "while the intermediate resolution simulation agrees well with the  @xcite result , the high resolution simulation agrees better with the  @xcite result .",
    "although the `` strong winds '' simulation suppressed star formation too efficiently in low mass systems in the intermediate resolution simulation , it may provide a good fit to the smhm relation at high resolution .",
    "interestingly , the high resolution simulation ( red line ) smhm relation is in good agreement with the  @xcite abundance matching relation at redshifts @xmath0 and @xmath25 , but is slightly offset from the  @xcite relation at redshift @xmath24 . at redshift @xmath24 ,",
    "the simulated low mass galaxies have more stellar mass than we would expect from abundance matching models .",
    "the offset between the simulations and abundance matching results is roughly a factor of two in stellar mass .",
    "this is directly related to the flat evolution of the number density of low mass systems demonstrated in figure  [ fig : weinmann_low_mass_galaxies ] , and is another indication that the simulated low mass galaxies are building up stellar mass too rapidly at or around redshift @xmath24 . as discussed previously , stronger star formation driven winds can suppress stellar masses buildup in these systems leading to better agreement at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "however , this comes at the expense of the agreement between the abundance matching and simulation redshift @xmath0 smhm relationship .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider whether alternative galactic wind implementations which have successfully reproduced the normalisation , slope , and scatter of the smhm relation at intermediate and high redshift will achieve similar agreement at low redshifts  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that our fiducial feedback model is capable of reproducing the abundance matching derived smhm relation to within a factor of two in galaxy stellar mass at all plotted redshifts .",
    "this is an important result because it implies that we can compare simulated galaxies against observed galaxies by matching them based on their stellar mass .",
    "this also implies that the galaxies in our simulations are building up their stellar mass similarly to what is inferred via abundance matching models ( modulo the discussion of the low mass systems around redshift @xmath24 ) .",
    "we note that @xcite highlighted the fact that while many simulations reproduce the redshift @xmath0 smhm relation correctly , their intermediate and high redshift smhm relations lie far from abundance matching results .",
    "although our fiducial model slightly overproduces the stellar mass content of low mass galaxies at early times , we emphasize that the magnitude of this overproduction is an improvement over many previous results  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we examined the simulated gsmf and smhm relationships , finding that our feedback models are capable of producing galaxy populations that build up stellar mass consistent with observations . to further differentiate the performance of our various feedback model choices , we consider additional constraints on how and when galaxies build up their stellar mass from direct observations of the evolution of the global star formation rate and star formation main sequence .",
    "we contrast the results of our various feedback models with those observations in the following subsections .",
    "the global cosmic sfr density ( sfrd ) has been measured out to high redshift in several bands including the uv  @xcite , radio  @xcite , uv / ir  @xcite , and fir  @xcite .",
    "there is an increasingly clear picture for the cosmic sfrd emerging , where the sfrd increases substantially from redshift @xmath27 to @xmath28  @xcite , reaches a peak value around redshift @xmath29 , and then begins to decline rapidly thereafter  @xcite . while the sfrd is generally limited by the growth rate of dark matter haloes at high redshift  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , the location of the turnover of the sfrd function as well as the steepness of the subsequent decline depend heavily on the implementation of feedback physics  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the role of feedback in shaping the sfrd for the particular set of simulations used in this paper has been discussed in paper i. here , we extend the discussion of paper i by identifying which haloes have had their star formation rates impacted the most by feedback and relating this to the build - up of stellar mass discussed in the previous section .",
    "we note that although the simulation box used here is relatively small , it has been previously shown that this box should be sufficiently large to capture the proper late time evolution of the cosmic sfrd  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrdensity ] shows the global cosmic sfrd as a function of redshift , broken down as a function of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the three panels show three distinct feedback models : `` no feedback '' ( left ) , `` no agn '' ( center ) , and `` l25n256 '' ( right )",

    "galactic winds : ( i ) reduce the early peak sfrs in low mass systems and ( ii ) increase the sfr contributions from low mass systems at late times .    correcting the late time behaviour of the sfrd evolution requires the introduction of agn feedback to regulate the growth of massive systems  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "feedback ( in particular , galactic winds ) plays a role in determining the normalisation of this relation .",
    "stronger star formation driven winds lead to higher sfms normalisations .",
    "this trend  which can be seen in both figures  [ fig : ssfr ] and [ fig : ssfr_evolution ]  is driven by two effects : ( i ) strong winds suppress the stellar mass growth of galaxies , moving them `` to the left '' in figure  [ fig : ssfr ] and ( ii ) by reducing star formation in low mass systems , strong winds increase the amount of star forming gas that is available to more massive systems at later times .",
    "the second of these points can also be seen as an increase in the bright end on the luminosity function shown in figure  [ fig : luminosityfunction ] .",
    "however , most of the feedback models show the same overall trend with redshift , which is driven by the reduction in the accretion rate with redshift which scales roughly as @xmath38  @xcite .    the resolution dependence of these results is demonstrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ssfr ] where we show the sfms for our fiducial feedback model at three different resolutions and the left panel of figure  [ fig : ssfr_evolution ] which shows the sfms normalisation evolution for the same simulations .",
    "there is a weak resolution dependence in the derived sfmss .",
    "this is especially true for the intermediate and high mass sfms relations , which are nearly identical at all plotted redshifts .",
    "we conclude that our galaxy formation model predicts a star formation main sequence which is in reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "this result is similar to that found in other recent studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , simulations have difficulties obtaining a sfms with a slope substantially shallower than unity and often have sfmss that are mildly depressed in their normalisation relative to observations .",
    "neither of these issues can be easily corrected without introducing problems in the simulated gsmf  especially at the low mass end .",
    "the offset between the simulated and observational sfms is fairly minor , but it should be noted that improving the agreement here would give rise to tension in other observationally constrained relations .",
    "the previous two sections focused on examining the buildup of stellar mass in our simulations . we have shown that our feedback models are capable of producing galaxy populations that form and evolve over time consistently with a wide range of observational constraints . in this section , we explore the simulated tully - fisher and mass - metallicity relations .",
    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation describes the observed correlation between galactic mass ( or luminosity ) and rotational velocity  @xcite .",
    "this is an important indicator of galactic structure because it combines information about galactic mass , concentration , and angular momentum .",
    "it is a major goal of galaxy formation models to explain the slope , zero - point , scatter , and redshift evolution of the tf relation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : tf ] shows the tully - fisher relations for the various feedback models at redshifts @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath0 .",
    "we show the binned median tully - fisher relation for the various feedback models ( bottom ) and resolutions ( top ) along with a two dimensional histogram denoting the distribution of galaxies for the `` l25n256 '' ( bottom ) and `` l25n512 '' ( top ) simulations . for comparison ,",
    "observational tully - fisher relations are also shown .",
    "the simulated galaxy populations do contain positive correlations between the galaxy stellar mass and @xmath39 . to parameterise our results",
    ", we adopt a functional form for the tf relation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the stellar mass , and @xmath39 is the circular velocity at twice the stellar half mass radius .",

    "the best fit is plotted within figure  [ fig : tf ] as a solid black line and the parameters are printed within the plotted region for the  l25n256 \" ( bottom ) and  l25n512 \" ( top ) simulations .",
    "feedback is required to obtain a proper slope and normalisation for the tully - fisher relation at any of the plotted redshifts , as seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : tf ] .",
    "the simulated `` no feedback '' tully - fisher relation is too steep and extends to substantially higher rotational velocities than are seen observationally .",
    "most of the feedback models produce consistent tully - fisher relation slopes , but there is some variability in the normalisation as has been discussed already in paper i. at redshift @xmath0 the l25n256 simulation @xmath43 relation has a slope of @xmath44 which is similar to the local tf relation slope found by  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* @xmath48 ) .",
    "although we do not list their slopes explicitly , the other feedback models explored here all yield similar slopes ( with the exception of the `` no feedback '' simulation ) .",
    "all of feedback simulations show a slight evolution in the normalisation of the tully - fisher relation towards higher rotational velocities at a fixed stellar mass at higher redshifts . since this evolution is somewhat subtle ( compared to e.g. , the sfms evolution )",
    ", we have included the redshift @xmath0 tf relation in all redshift plots .",
    "the normalisation evolution is similar to that found in high redshift disk - dominated samples  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we note that while a number of previous studies have indicated that there is an offset in the high redshift tf relation relative to the local tf relation that increases with redshift  @xcite , there is also evidence suggesting that no such evolution occurs in the tf normalisation  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear exactly what drives the discrepancy in the observed normalisation evolution .",
    "however , one possibility is that the offset is sensitive to galaxy morphology  @xcite which could explain why the rotationally dominated selected samples  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found clear tf relation offsets .",
    "the resolution dependence of these inferences can be seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : tf ] where we show the simulated tully - fisher relation for our fiducial feedback model at three different resolutions .",
    "there is a noticeable offset between the low and intermediate resolution simulations at all redshifts , with the intermediate resolution simulation having lower rotational velocities at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "the magnitude of this offset decreases between the intermediate and high resolution simulations , and is particularly small for the most massive systems at all redshifts .",
    "this indicates that the simulated tully - fisher relation is numerically converging for our highest resolution simulations .",
    "moreover , we note that the highest resolution simulations are converging to a tully - fisher relation which is consistent with the marked observational relations at all redshifts . while the measured slope of the simulated intermediate resolution simulation remained fixed at @xmath47 over the plotted redshift range , the slope of the high resolution simulation remains nearly fixed at a slightly larger value of @xmath49  which is still consistent with the local and high redshift measured tf slopes .",
    "overall , we find that our fiducial feedback galaxy formation model describes the evolution of the slope and normalisation of the stellar tf relation reasonably well ( certainly much better than our model without feedback ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the conclusions of several previous simulation based studies that examined the local tully - fisher relation  ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , it is found that including feedback is critical to obtaining the correct tf normalisation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because it reduces buildup of stellar material in a central , compact component .",
    "we do not find any significant evolution in the slope of the tf relation with redshift , but we do find an evolution in the normalisation which is consistent with both observational results and previous simulation work  @xcite .",
    "after metals are returned to the ism from aging stellar populations , they can be retained in the ism , locked into future generations of stars , or ejected from the galaxy via outflow processes driven by stellar winds or agn activity .",
    "although not all of these processes are directly observable , hii region nebular emission line diagnostics allow for observational estimates of the metallicity of star - forming gas in galaxies .",
    "this provides information that can constrain the character of outflow models .",
    "although it is critical to many of the results presented in the previous sections that strong winds must operate on low mass galaxies in order for their stellar mass build - up to mimic observations , these same winds will carry metals along with them and can potentially deplete a substantial fraction of a galaxy s metal content . on the other hand , in the absence of any strong feedback we expect that galaxies will be unable to eject any metals which they produce , potentially leading to an overproduction of metals .",
    "figure  [ fig : mzr ] shows the mz relations for our various feedback models at redshifts @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the metallicities have been determined by finding the average star formation rate weighted oxygen abundance in each galaxy , which places an emphasis on star - forming gas as is done through metallicity estimates via nebular emission lines . in each figure , we show a two - dimensional histogram denoting the distribution of galaxies for the `` l25n256 '' ( bottom panel ) and `` l25n512 '' ( top panel ) simulations . additionally , we show coloured lines marking the binned median mz relation for the various feedback models ( bottom ) and resolutions ( top ) as noted in the legend .",
    "observational mz relations are shown within the figures for comparison .",
    "we include mz data from sdss dr7  @xcite , deep2  @xcite , and  @xcite at redshifts @xmath0 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 as compiled in table 1 of  @xcite for comparison against the simulation results .",
    "there are uncertainties in the overall normalisation of the observed metallicity abundance measurements , so we apply the empirical conversion of  @xcite and plot the observed mz data using the  ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter : kk04 ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter : pp04 ) diagnostics .",
    "the metal content of galaxies is strongly dependent on the adopted feedback model , as demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mzr ] . at redshift @xmath25 ,",
    "all of the models ( except for the `` no feedback '' case ) produce mz relations that are fairly similar in shape .",
    "there is some dispersion in their normalisations .",
    "simulations with strong feedback are efficient at ejecting metals out of galaxies , and tend to have lower mz relation normalisations .",
    "conversely , simulations with weak winds tend to have higher mz relation normalisations . at the low mass end ,",
    "the offset between the `` strong winds '' and `` weak winds '' simulations is about 0.3 dex , with the fiducial feedback model ( l25n256 ) falling right in - between .",
    "changes in the agn feedback do not have a major impact on the high redshift mz relation . in any case , at redshift @xmath25 all of the feedback models fall between in the pp04 and kk04 measured mz relations , and so we can not rule out any of the models clearly ( except for the `` no feedback '' case ) .    at redshift @xmath52 ,",
    "the observed mz relation has shifted slightly upward toward higher metallicities at all mass scales .",
    "many of the feedback simulations show a similar shift . however , the simulations evolve toward higher metallicities preferentially for massive systems , which steepens the simulated mz relation relative to the observed relation . as a result ,",
    "all of the feedback runs now have slopes that are slightly steeper than the observed relations .",
    "two of the runs ( `` weak winds '' and `` slow winds '' ) are well in excess of the observed kk04 mz relation .",
    "most of the other runs , however , are still situated between the pp04 and kk04 observational relations .",
    "overall , the most notable missing feature from the simulated mz relation is the flattening of the mz relation for some of the more massive systems .",
    "while the observed mz relation flattens for basically all metallicity diagnostics at all observed redshifts , our simulated mz relation does not show a similar behaviour .    at redshift @xmath0 ,",
    "the simulated mz relation is now clearly distinct in shape from the observed mz relation .",
    "the three main descriptive features of the observed mz relations are the low mass slope , the high mass flattening , and the overall normalisation .",
    "none of the feedback models accurately reproduce the low mass slope or the high mass flattening .",
    "instead , most of the feedback models produce a constant slope mz relation that is steeper than the observed relation .",
    "there remains a clear dispersion in the normalisation of the mz relation for the various feedback models .",
    "most of the models lie between the pp04 and kk04 mz relations in the galaxy mass range @xmath53 .",
    "however , owing to the their steep slopes , most of the models have both insufficiently low metallicity galaxies at the low mass end and overly enriched galaxies at the high mass end .    the resolution dependence of the simulated mz relation can be seen in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mzr ] .",
    "there are no major or systematic changes in the simulated mz relation between the different resolution simulations .",
    "this consistency holds true for all of the plotted redshifts , indicating that the mz relation is well converged .",
    "any issues with the shape of the simulated mz relation are not likely to substantially change if we moved to higher resolution simulations .",
    "the origin of the steep mz slope in our simulations is the low metal retention efficiency of low mass galaxies owing to galactic winds with large mass loadings .",
    "strong winds facilitate the mixing of the central metal rich disk gas with the metal poor hot halo gas . in low mass galaxies  where the mass loading factors for winds are very high ",
    "this prevents a substantial buildup of metal mass , which ultimately leads to the steep redshift @xmath0 mz relation shown in figure  [ fig : mzr ] .",
    "we note that this effect is stronger if we do not treat the mass and metal loading for our winds independently .",
    "as described above and in paper i , we have adopted a wind metal loading factor in our model , which determines the metallicity of the wind material relative to the local ism metallicity from where the wind is launched .",
    "even with a reduced metal loading factor , which helps galaxies maintain a larger fraction of the metals they produce , we still find that the lowest mass galaxies have gas - phase metallicities that are at or below the lowest of observational expectations .",
    "this exposes an interesting tension between our need for high wind efficiencies to reduce the buildup of stellar mass in low mass galaxies , and the need for low mass galaxies to be relatively efficient at retaining their metal content  @xcite .",
    "the solution to this tension likely either lies in : ( i ) fundamentally reducing the accretion efficiency of low mass galaxies via some feedback mechanism that is able to disrupt and heat the igm around these systems or ( ii ) a more detailed wind model that self consistently handles the entrainment of low metallicity material as winds propagate out of galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that many of our feedback models are capable of producing an mz relation which has an appropriate slope and normalisation at high redshift , but is notably steeper than observations at low redshift ( albeit with reasonable normalisations ) .",
    "several previous studies have been successful at reproducing the mz relation at both redshift @xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and higher redshifts  @xcite and we note that the mz results presented in this section are somewhat different from what has been found previously  .",
    "there are three principle sources of differences between our models and earlier ones , which are all numerical in nature .",
    "first , the gas fractions of the galaxies formed in the simulations presented are generally higher than those of  @xcite .",
    "this is partially due to differences in the way galaxies accrete gas  @xcite and form central gas reservoirs  @xcite , which makes it difficult to separate out particular aspects of the calculations that lead to results that are different from ours .",
    "higher gas fractions lead to diluted / lowered metallicity values , which is partially responsible for the lower metallicity values of low mass galaxies found in our simulations .",
    "second , while mixing is numerically suppressed in sph simulations , it can be artificially enhanced in grid based simulations due to poor resolution . employing a moving mesh hydro solver",
    "minimises the impact of artificial mixing significantly  @xcite . nevertheless , mixing in our simulations",
    "is more efficient than in previous sph simulations , which will lead to a systematic lowering ( or dilution via mixing ) of the central galactic gas phase metallicity .",
    "third , the wind prescriptions used in  @xcite are momentum conserving , which scale less steeply with galaxy mass than the energy conserving wind models adopted here .",
    "these effects translate into a shallower mz relation , which would be in better agreement with the redshift @xmath0 observed mz slope , as was found in  @xcite . the overall picture observed in our simulations of mixing dominating",
    "the reduction in the observed metallicity of low mass systems is similar to that presented in  @xcite , except in our case this process is too efficient to reproduce observations .",
    "this places constraints on the character of our wind model which will be considered in future work .",
    "simulating the formation and evolution of the galaxy population in a fully cosmological context is an inherently difficult numerical task .",
    "it requires a very large dynamic range such that galactic structural scales can be resolved within a full cosmic volume simulation box .",
    "furthermore , it requires numerically well - posed modelling of the complex baryon physical processes to yield realistic galaxy populations .    in paper",
    "i we introduced a new feedback module into the simulation code arepo which is intended to regulate the growth of galaxies by introducing star formation driven winds and agn feedback .",
    "it was shown that  with this feedback module included  our simulations are able to match a number of redshift @xmath0 observed galaxy relations . the primary goal of this paper is to extend the work presented in paper i by presenting a summary of high redshift galaxy properties as realised in a set of large - volume , high - resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with varied assumptions for the star formation driven winds and agn feedback .",
    "the critical point of including feedback in our models is to regulate when and where galaxies build up their stellar mass .",
    "the performance of any such model can be directly tested by comparing against observations at several epochs . as we have attempted to demonstrate throughout this paper ,",
    "we have constructed a reasonably self - consistent model , where galactic stellar mass measurements , star formation rate measurements , and even structural measurements are reproduced by our fiducial feedback model without major violations of observational constraints . however , our implementation of feedback is not unique , and it is worth discussing some of the more subtle tensions that exist in our models that might provide information about how we can improve upon them in the future .    our currently implemented star formation driven wind prescription is based on the kinetic wind model of  @xcite with a modification to allow for variable wind speeds based on the local dark matter velocity dispersion  @xcite . in our models , these winds are critical for reproducing the evolving low mass slope of the gsmf and regulating the magnitude of global star formation rate density in low mass haloes in the early universe .",
    "the two free parameters in this model ( the energy normalisation and the wind speed ) have been set based on their ability to reproduce the evolving sfrd and redshift @xmath0 gsmf ( and , similarly , the redshift @xmath0 smhm relation ) . by examining the evolution of low mass galaxies",
    ", we found there is an overproduction of stellar mass in these systems at early times compared to current observational standards as shown in figure  [ fig : gsmf ] as well as in figure  [ fig : smhm ] .",
    "this offset can not be fully corrected by simply introducing a larger energy normalisation for our wind model because of the characteristic flat evolution in the number density of low mass systems in all of our feedback model simulations at late times .",
    "similarly all of our simulations tend to mildly undershoot the observed sfms normalisation with a slope that is systematically steeper than sfms observational measurements .",
    "this makes the disagreement between our simulations and observations the worst for low mass galaxies .",
    "introducing stronger winds does tend to increase the normalisation of the sfms .",
    "however , the normalisation shift is most pronounced at late times ( after previously ejected wind material has had time to re - accrete ) , while the normalisation offset between observations and simulations is most dramatic at high redshift ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our fiducial feedback model matches a wide range of observational metrics .",
    "we note that our model only slightly overshoots in the mass buildup of low mass galaxies ( by a factor of @xmath54 ) and only slightly undershoots the observed star formation rates of low mass galaxies ( by , again , a factor of @xmath54 ) .",
    "given that observational uncertainties on , e.g. , stellar mass measurements  @xcite or star formation rate determinations can be of this same order , we would not stress this as being a critical issue to our model . however , we emphasise that within the context of our adopted kinetic wind model there are not any immediate or clear alternative parameter choices that will allow us to simultaneously reduce these tensions further .",
    "one clue regarding the nature of our wind model can be obtained from comparisons with observed mz relations .",
    "the large wind mass loading factors that are required to regulate the growth of low mass systems double back as very efficient mechanisms to eject metals from galaxies .",
    "this gives rise to an important , yet seemingly unappreciated , tension .",
    "empirical estimates of the total oxygen content of low mass galaxies indicate that these systems can eject only some reasonably small fraction ( e.g. , @xmath55 ) of their metals  @xcite . yet ,",
    "when cosmological simulations tune their wind prescriptions to match , e.g. , the galaxy stellar mass function , they often adopt very strong wind mass loading factors that substantially exceed this limit under the traditional assumption that the metallicity of wind material is the same as the metallicity of the local ism from where the wind was launched .",
    "there are two clear ways to resolve this issue .",
    "the first is to reduce the efficiency with which material is ejected out of galaxies .",
    "this can be achieved very straightforwardly in our models by lowering the energy normalisation for our winds .",
    "however , doing so would immediately increase the masses of all galaxies , ruining the agreement with the gsmf , smhm relation , and early sfrd evolution .",
    "a more robust solution would be to allow winds to have a more disruptive effect on the accretion of gas into low mass galaxies . by , for example , allowing winds to be pushed by cosmic ray streaming  @xcite or to carry along with them some thermal energy , it may be possible to reduce the star formation rates in low mass galaxies by disrupting the igm around these systems .",
    "the second possible solution is to modify our sub - grid picture for the wind structure , as we have done in this paper .",
    "substantially higher resolution simulations on the origin of galactic winds indicate that : ( i ) wind mass loading factors far in excess of unity are physically plausible and ( ii ) the origin and composition of ejected material can depend on the physical mechanism responsible for launching the wind  @xcite . by accounting for the impact of low metallicity gas entrainment that might occur as a wind propagates out of the systems",
    ", the evolution of the mz relation can be brought back into reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "it is likely that both of these issues are partially responsible for the mz relation tension , and it will be interesting to consider how alternative galactic wind formulations and modifications of our currently employed hydrodynamically decoupled wind prescriptions can resolve this issue .    the most promising next step to be taken with these models is to extend their application to larger simulation volumes at comparable mass and spatial resolution to the runs we have employed here .",
    "the @xmath56 mpc boxes used in this paper have served as excellent testbeds for understanding the impact of our feedback models . within these volumes",
    "we can already find a wide variety of galaxy properties and demonstrate the success of our model in reproducing basic observational constraints like the gsmf and cosmic sfrd .",
    "however , this ( relatively small ) simulation box does not do an adequate job of sampling different density environments or of producing a sufficiently large number of massive galaxies , groups , and clusters to perform detailed statistical modelling . for this reason ,",
    "our ability to discuss the high redshift cutoff the gsmf or the turnover in the smhm relation is limited .",
    "moreover , our ability to do detailed morphological classification and perform environment studies is limited .",
    "this can be remedied by moving to larger simulation volumes ( ideally without sacrificing mass or spatial resolution ) .",
    "using larger simulation volumes , many additional science question can be addressed including correlations between galactic star formation rate and environment , correlations between galactic morphology and physical properties , or the predominant formation venues for massive elliptical and star forming disk galaxies .",
