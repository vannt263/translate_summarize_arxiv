    "the first major event in the universe after the big bang and the inflation stage is the creation of light elements @xcite including d , he-3 and li , which are of importance for our everyday life or considered as energy source on the earth in the future .",
    "the combination of neutron and proton to form deuterium is the first step in the nuclear reaction chain .",
    "the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts when the temperature of the universe is about @xmath3mev ( redshift @xmath4 ) and the deuterium destroying high energy photons have become rare .",
    "bbn proceeds swiftly after this deuterium bottleneck is overcome and is over by @xmath5mev .",
    "the next major event in the universe is that of the recombination of primordial plasma ( @xcite;@xcite ) to form neutral atoms starting with helium iii to helium ii recombination at @xmath6 and ending with hydrogen recombination at @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we will explore a unique connection between these two major events , the recombination of beryllium @xmath0be and its decay to lithium @xmath8 and in the process also mention a doublet of narrow lines in the cosmic neutrino background .",
    "this unique event brings together the mev scale nuclear physics of nucleosynthesis and ev scale atomic physics of recombination .",
    "we will also find that the very low energy atomic physics of hyperfine transitions in @xmath2 has a surprisingly strong influence on the decay properties of @xmath2 usually associated with mev scale physics .",
    "this problem of beryllium to lithium conversion is one of the last problems not investigated in detail so far connected with the primordial nucleosynthesis and the process of recombination of ions and electrons in the radiation field of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "this problem is very attractive because it demonstrates a very rare case in astrophysics when the atomic processes and even the populations of the hyperfine structure influences nuclear processes .",
    "the cosmological parameters used for numerical calculations are hubble constant @xmath9 , matter fraction @xmath10 , cmb temperature @xmath11 , baryon fraction @xmath12 , cosmological constant @xmath13 .",
    "at the end of bbn the abundances of light elements relative to hydrogen are @xcite : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the abundance of all heavier elements , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the abundance of species @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei . note that about @xmath28 of the primordial @xmath29 comes from @xmath14 and only @xmath30 of @xmath29 is produced directly in bbn , this division is however sensitive to the baryon to photon ratio @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 in its fully ionized state in the early universe is stable .",
    "fully ionized beryllium can capture electrons from the plasma at the high densities in the stellar interiors @xcite .",
    "however the electron capture rate for the fully ionized beryllium from the plasma is completely negligible in the early universe due to the low electron density .",
    "once recombined with an electron beryllium decays by electron capture through the following reactions @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the excited state of lithium nucleus with energy @xmath34kev above the ground state .",
    "the q - value of the reaction is @xmath35kev @xcite .",
    "the laboratory value for the half life of @xmath2 is 53.2 days .",
    "the branching ratio is @xmath36 for reaction [ r2 ] .",
    "these laboratory values have been calculated and measured for neutral @xmath2 with four electrons .",
    "the @xmath2 in the primordial plasma will however decay as soon as it acquires a single electron .",
    "therefore we are interested in hydrogen - like @xmath37 .",
    "the electrons in the @xmath38 shell of neutral @xmath2 have a @xmath39 effect on the decay rate as shown by experiments involving @xmath40 as well as other chemical compositions @xcite and we will ignore the influence of 2s shell electrons in the discussions below .",
    "helium - like @xmath41 has practically the same lifetime and branching ratio as the neutral @xmath2 .",
    "the change in the decay rate and the branching ratio from helium - like @xmath41 to hydrogen - like @xmath37 depends strongly on the spin temperature of the hyperfine structure of hydrogen - like @xmath37 ions .",
    "this statement is easy to understand .",
    "we will make simple estimates of decay rates based on the calculations by @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 has a nuclear spin of @xmath43 which is different from the nuclear spin of @xmath44 of @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "the two initial states available for @xmath37 are with total angular momentum @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the two final states available to @xmath47 are @xmath48 .",
    "thus the angular momentum can only be conserved for the reaction [ r2 ] from the initial state @xmath46 of @xmath37 to the final state @xmath49 of @xmath42 .",
    "the reaction is suppressed for the other initial hyperfine state with total angular momentum @xmath45 .",
    "correspondingly for reaction [ r1 ] , where the nuclear spin does not change in the reaction , the two available final states have the same total angular momentum as the initial state , @xmath50 , and the reactions from both the initial hyperfine states are possible .",
    "millielectronvolt hyperfine splitting dictates the branching ratio for these two nuclear reactions . in hydrogen - like @xmath37 ion the population levels of the two hyperfine states ( or equivalently the spin temperature ) are determined by the rates of radiative decay and pumping due to well known physical processes .",
    "our calculation is simplified because pumping by the cmb radiation field and due to electron collisions is much faster than the decay rate and cosmological time , i.e. the spin temperature should be close to the cmb temperature @xmath51 equal at that time to the electron temperature .",
    "the energy of the hyperfine splitting is much smaller than the temperature at that time .",
    "this means that the spin temperature is very high compared to the hyperfine splitting and the hyperfine structure sublevels are populated according to their statistical weights .",
    "the lyman-@xmath52 resonant scattering @xcite with rate @xmath53 at @xmath54 , spin changing collisions with electrons with rate @xmath55 @xcite and stimulated emission and absorption of cmb at hyperfine transition with rate @xmath56 are all faster than the decay rate @xmath57 and would make the spin temperature equal to the matter / radiation temperature @xmath51 . above @xmath58",
    "is the absorption cross section for lyman@xmath59 photons including the line profile from doppler broadening .",
    "@xmath60 is the background cmb intensity .",
    "it corresponds to wien region of the black body spectrum for the lyman-@xmath52 photons and rayleigh - jeans region for the hyperfine transition radiation .",
    "@xmath61 is the einstein b coefficient for stimulated emission .",
    "@xmath62 is the electron number density and @xmath63 is the spin change cross section .",
    "@xmath64 for hydrogenic ions @xcite , where @xmath65 is the nuclear charge .",
    "there is also a mild energy dependence of the cross section at temperatures of interest of @xmath66 .",
    "the spin change cross section for hydrogen - electron collisions is of the order @xmath67 at @xmath68k ( @xcite;@xcite ) and thus for @xmath37 it will be @xmath69 .",
    "thus lyman-@xmath52 scattering , ionization and recombination , collisions with electrons and stimulated emission and radiation of cmb and maintains @xmath70 .",
    "these rates are plotted in figure [ fig1 ] along with the expansion rate defined by the hubble parameter @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a typical hydrogenic beryllium atom would have flipped its electron spin a billion times due to lyman-@xmath52 scattering and recombined and ionized @xmath72 times before finally being able to decay .",
    "the energy difference between the two hyperfine states is @xmath73 .",
    "thus the hyperfine states would always be distributed according to their statistical weights .    in helium - like",
    "@xmath41 ( or li - like and neutral @xmath2 ) spin directions of two @xmath74 shell electrons is always opposite and the problem radically differs from the problem in the hydrogen - like ion .",
    "thus there is no hyperfine splitting in the case of helium - like ions , but the relative direction of the spins of the captured electron and nucleus is of great importance .",
    "we can write the probabilities of the two reactions in helium - like ions in terms of the corresponding probabilities of the hydrogen - like ions in the two hyperfine states using the recent theoretical calculations of @xcite which have the support of experiments involving hydrogen - like and helium - like @xmath75 ions @xcite",
    ". then we can use these relations and the relative populations of the hyperfine structure sub - levels in the hydrogen - like ions to find the formula for the probabilities of both channels of interest .",
    "the reactions for hydrogen - like @xmath37 and helium - like @xmath41 are summarized in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .    for reaction [ r1 ] the initial and final spin of the nuclei",
    "are same , @xmath44 and the electron capture rates of @xmath41 and @xmath37 are related by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the decay rates from two hyperfine states of @xmath37 . if @xmath78 are the fraction of atoms in the two hyperfine states , the net decay rate is given by @xmath79 where we used the fact that @xmath80 .",
    "the factor of two can be understood as follows . in the helium - like atom",
    "both channels corresponding to @xmath81 and @xmath82 are available simultaneously which are added according to the statistical weights . for the hydrogen - like atom also for high spin temperature",
    "we add the probabilities of two channels according to the statistical weights .",
    "but for the helium - like atom the capture rate gets multiplied by a factor of two corresponding to the fact that any of the available electrons can be captured through any of the available channels .",
    "thus the factor of two is the result of the fact that there are two electrons available for helium - like atom and that for high spin temperature for the hydrogen - like atom we add the capture rates according to their statistical weights .",
    "this factor would , in general , be different from two if the atoms in the hyperfine state were not distributed according to their statistical weights , for example at low temperatures comparable to the energy difference between the two states .",
    "since the statistically averaged rate coefficients relevant for our calculation for the helium - like and hydrogen - like atoms differ by a just factor of two , we do not need the individual rates for @xmath81 and @xmath82 and can use the experimental result for the helium - like / neutral @xmath2 .",
    "for reaction [ r2 ] however the @xmath42 has a spin of @xmath83 and only capture from @xmath84 state is allowed .",
    "the above formula is valid with @xmath85 and for the net decay rate we have the same result , @xmath86 .",
    "we are using @xmath87 for the reaction rates of reaction [ r2 ] while no @xmath87 indicates the reaction rates for reaction [ r1 ] . using the laboratory value of @xmath88 for the total decay rate of @xmath41 ,",
    "we get net decay rate @xmath89 with the same branching ratio , @xmath90 of the decays following reaction [ r2 ] .",
    "the half life of hydrogen - like @xmath37 with the hyperfine states distributed according to their statistical weights is thus equal to 106.4 days .",
    "coincidently this is the same result we would have got from the simple considerations of the electron density at the nucleus .",
    "we must emphasize here that the exact life time of @xmath37 is not very important for us as long as it is much shorter than the cosmological time at the epoch of beryllium to lithium conversion and the duration of @xmath37 recombination .",
    "all the width of the two neutrino lines comes from the kinetics of recombination .",
    "in particular we have ignored the electron - electron interaction in the helium - like @xmath41 , the effect of which on our calculation of time of @xmath2 decay and the neutrino spectrum would be @xmath91 .",
    "now we can write down the kinetic equations for recombination of @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93\\\\ \\frac{dx_{\\besth}}{dz } & = \\frac{1}{h(z)(1+z)}\\left[-n_e(z)x_{\\besf}\\alpha_{\\besf } +    \\beta_{\\besth}x_{\\besth}+\\lambda_{\\rm{bbn}}x_{\\besth}\\right]\\\\ x_{\\bes } & = x_{\\lis}^{decay}+x_{\\besf}+x_{\\besth},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the number density of electrons at redshift @xmath95 , @xmath71 is the hubble parameter , @xmath96 is the total recombination coefficient including recombination to the ground state .",
    "@xmath97 is the lithium fraction coming from decay of beryllium and excludes the lithium produced during bbn . because of the extremely low number density of beryllium , the number of ionizing photons released during direct recombination to the ground state is negligible ( about 10 orders of magnitude less ) compared to the ionizing photons already present in the background radiation and can be neglected .",
    "@xmath98 is the total ionization coefficient which is related to @xmath96 by the condition that saha equation must be satisfied in equilibrium .",
    "thus @xmath99 note that the 2-photon decay rate from @xmath38 state of @xmath37 is @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this is much faster than the same rate for hydrogen @xmath101 due to the higher charge of the nucleus .",
    "more importantly it is much faster than the ionization rate @xmath102 at @xmath103 and the electron capture rate @xmath104 , @xmath105days .",
    "thus @xmath38 level must be included in the total recombination coefficient .",
    "the number of ly@xmath52 photons produced would be of order @xmath106 and can be neglected .",
    "thus equations for beryllium recombination are much simpler than that of hydrogen and helium recombination .",
    "@xmath96 is the total recombination coefficient including direct recombinations to the ground state and is given by @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 and @xmath65 is the nuclear charge .. figure [ fig4 ] shows the result of integrating the recombination equations for beryllium . for comparison the saha equilibrium solution for beryllium recombination is also shown .",
    "the beryllium to lithium conversion occurs significantly earlier at @xmath113 than the @xmath114 value predicted by the saha solution .",
    "the reason of the difference is connected with the short decay time of recombined @xmath37 . in the saha equation",
    "we follow the balance between the recombination and photoionization but a typical atom has recombined and ionized many times even though the net recombination in equilibrium may be small .",
    "in reality due to the decay of beryllium on a time scale much shorter than the cosmological time the equilibrium is never established .",
    "every decay of beryllium to lithium is accompanied by emission of an electron neutrino with @xmath115 of them having energy of @xmath35kev and nuclear recoil energy of @xmath116ev .",
    "@xmath90 of the decays go to excited state of lithium , electron neutrino gets @xmath117kev and nuclear recoil has energy of only @xmath118ev which is slightly larger than the thermal energy @xmath119 of the plasma at redshift @xmath113 .",
    "the recoil velocity of @xmath120 will result in a natural line width of @xmath121ev due to doppler shift for the @xmath34kev photon emitted when lithium relaxes to ground state almost instantaneously ( @xmath122fs ) .",
    "these photons will down scatter by compton scattering with electrons giving most of their energy to the plasma due to recoil effect @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer by compton scattering will become inefficient when the photons reach the critical energy of @xmath123ev when the energy transfer rate becomes less than the expansion rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "this will leave a small distortion in the high energy part of cmb .",
    "the energy transfered to plasma will additionally cause a @xmath124type distortion of @xmath125 .",
    "the neutrinos however will free stream to us and we can calculate the neutrino spectrum today .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ fig5 ] including both @xmath35kev neutrinos and @xmath117kev neutrinos , @xmath126,\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the density of hydrogen nuclei at @xmath128 .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for the first line is @xmath129ev and the central energy is @xmath130ev . for the second line",
    "the fwhm is @xmath131ev with a central energy of @xmath132ev .",
    "the line width at half maximum is @xmath133 .",
    "the width and asymmetric line profile of these lines is defined by the kinetics of recombination .",
    "at @xmath134 annihilation of electrons and positrons makes the biggest contribution to cosmic neutrinos , however these neutrinos have a much broader thermal spectrum and form part of the low energy cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) .",
    "decay of neutrons and other nuclear reactions during bbn also contribute neutrinos , but due to high redshift @xmath135 these neutrinos are also today redshifted to the sub - ev energies , @xmath136 .",
    "the spectrum of these neutrinos would be broad since they are emitted over a period when redshift changes by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "energy released during bbn is also quickly thermalized and does not lead to spectral distortions .",
    "decay of tritium created during bbn occurs at @xmath138 corresponding to half life of @xmath139 years .",
    "decay of tritium to helium-3 results in an electron with average energy of @xmath140kev and an antineutrino with average energy @xmath141kev .",
    "the antineutrino spectrum would be broad as they decay over a period corresponding to the age of the universe at that time and these antineutrinos would have an average energy of @xmath142 today assuming they have zero mass . about @xmath143 of tritium",
    "has decayed by @xmath144 and @xmath145 by z=@xmath146 leading to the width of the neutrino spectrum of @xmath147 .",
    "this broadening is comparable to the intrinsic width of the neutrino spectrum @xmath148 .",
    "thus non - thermal neutrinos from all sources before recombination other than @xmath2 decay would have a spectrum much broader than those from @xmath2 decay and would have much lower energy .",
    "these low energy neutrinos would be non - relativistic today in more than one mass eigenstates @xcite compared to relativistic neutrinos from @xmath2 decay .",
    "the energy released into the plasma from tritium decay in the form of energetic electrons would result in a chemical potential of @xmath149 in the cmb .",
    "this is about the same amount of entropy generated in the beryllium decay much later .",
    "lithium-7 observed today was originally produced as beryllium-7 during primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "although half life of beryllium atoms is very short , it has to wait until the beginning of recombination epoch to decay .",
    "we have calculated the exact redshift when this happens .",
    "we have also estimated the effect of energy release during the decay on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "in addition the neutrinos produced during the decay give rise to unique narrow lines in the cosmic neutrino background .",
    "these lines are too weak to be observable today .",
    "we should mention that the detection of the much more numerous but lower energy cnb neutrinos is currently being discussed @xcite .",
