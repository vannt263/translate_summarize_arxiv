    "turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection has been a system of much research interest .",
    "the system consists of a closed cell of fluid which is heated from below and cooled from above . when the applied temperature difference is large enough , the fluid moves and convection occurs .",
    "the flow state is characterized by the geometry of the cell and two dimensionless control parameters : the rayleigh number ra , which measures how much the fluid is driven and the prandtl number pr , which is the ratio of the diffusivities of momentum and heat of the fluid .",
    "the two parameters are defined by ra @xmath0 , and pr @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the maintained temperature difference , @xmath3 is the height of the cell , @xmath4 the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are respectively the volume expansion coefficient , kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the fluid .",
    "when ra is sufficiently large , the convection becomes turbulent .    besides the issue of the statistical characteristics of the velocity and temperature fluctuations , it is of interest to understand the heat transport by the fluid , which is an overall response of the system .",
    "the heat transport is usually expressed as the dimensionless nusselt number nu , which is the ratio of the measured heat flux to the heat transported were there only conduction . before the onset of convection",
    ", heat is transported only by conduction and nu is identically equal to one .",
    "when convection occurs , heat is more effectively transported by the fluid due to its motion and nu increases from 1 .",
    "a major question is then to understand how nu depends on ra and pr .",
    "the work of libchaber and coworkers on turbulent convection in low temperature helium gas@xcite showed that nu has a simple power - law dependence on ra : @xmath8 and the exponent @xmath9 is almost equal to @xmath10 , which is different from @xmath11 , the value that marginal stability arguments@xcite would give .",
    "this result led to the development of several theories@xcite which all give @xmath12 but were based on rather different physical assumptions . in particular , the chicago mixing - zone model @xcite emphasizes the heat transport by the thermal plumes , the coherent structures observed in turbulent convection while the theory by shraiman and siggia@xcite focuses on the effect of the shear of the large - scale mean flow on the heat transport ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent experimental results appeared to further complicate the situation .",
    "niemela et al.@xcite reported a value of @xmath9 close to 0.31 for measurements in low temperature helium gas that cover a much larger range of ra , from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "xu et al.@xcite studied turbulent convection in acetone in several experimental cells of different aspect ratios and concluded that there is no significant range of ra over which the scaling behavior eq .",
    "( [ nura ] ) holds .",
    "furthermore , they showed that for ra @xmath15 , the dependence of nu on ra can be represented by a combination of two power laws , which is consistent with a recent theory by grossmann and lohse@xcite . in grossmann and lohse s theory ,",
    "the viscous and thermal dissipation were decomposed into their bulk and boundary - layer contributions , and ten asymptotic regimes were obtained@xcite .",
    "another interesting feature observed in turbulent convection is the presence of a persistent large - scale mean flow which spans the whole experimental cell@xcite .",
    "the maximum mean velocity of the flow was also found to scale as ra to about 1/2@xcite .",
    "the presence of a large - scale flow naturally induces an interaction between the top and bottom thermal boundary layers .",
    "such an interaction was taken to be absent in the marginal stability arguments",
    ". one obvious effect of the velocity field , which satisfies the no - slip boundary condition , is that it produces a shear near the boundaries , which was first studied in ref.@xcite .    in convection ,",
    "the equations of motion are :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the velocity field , @xmath18 the pressure divided by density and @xmath19 the temperature field , while @xmath20 is the unit vector in the vertical direction .",
    "the velocity and temperature are thus coupled dynamically in a complicated fashion and have to be solved together .",
    "physically , the velocity field is driven by the applied temperature difference .",
    "the flow in turn determines the temperature profile , and thus the heat transport , in a self - consistent manner .    to gain insights of the problem of heat transport in turbulent convection ,",
    "we have turned to the simpler problem of heat transport by prescribed velocity fields that have features of the large - scale mean flow observed .",
    "the large - scale flow has two dominant features : ( i ) it is a circulating flow that spans the whole experimental cell and ( ii ) it generates a shear near the boundaries . in an earlier paper ,",
    "ching and lo studied separately these two features and their effects on the heat transport@xcite .",
    "they found that nu scales with the peclet number that measures the maximum velocity to an exponent 1/2 for a purely circulating flow and scales with the normalized shear rate to an exponent 1/3 for a pure shear .",
    "pure circulating or pure shear flows are , however , not physical fluid flows within a closed box . in this paper , we continue along these lines of thought and study the heat transport by _ physical _ velocity fields in a unit square cell that have both the circulating and the shear - generating features .",
    "we focus on the dependence of the heat transport on the maximum velocity and the shear rate of the flows .",
    "we first formulate our problem in sec .",
    "then we present our numerical results and discuss how these results can be understood in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we further discuss how these results are relevant to the understanding of heat transport in turbulent convection .",
    "finally , we end the paper with a summary and conclusions in sec . v.",
    "we solve the steady - state advection - diffusion equation @xmath21 for a prescribed incompressible velocity field @xmath22 in a unit square cell : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a temperature difference of @xmath2 is applied across the @xmath25-direction while no heat conduction is allowed across the @xmath26-direction .",
    "that is , the temperature field @xmath27 satisfies the following boundary conditions : @xmath28    for the velocity field , we take @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some function of @xmath31 or @xmath32 and @xmath33 is its derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is incompressible and separable in @xmath26 and @xmath25 . to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition ,",
    "we require @xmath35 moreover , for @xmath34 to be a circulating flow , we require @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are antisymmetric about @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "we have studied two forms of @xmath30 .",
    "the first form is algebraic .",
    "when @xmath30 is algebraic , eqs .",
    "( [ noslip ] ) and ( [ antisym ] ) imply that @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "thus we choose @xmath43 \\label{algebraic}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive constants .",
    "equation ( [ algebraic ] ) is the simplest algebraic form that allows us to change both the circulating strength and the shear rate of the flow ( see below ) .",
    "the other is an exponential form of @xmath30 : @xmath46 ^ 2 \\label{exponential}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positive constants . for @xmath49",
    ", the exponential form reduces to the algebraic form with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath48 is large , the velocity decays exponentially towards the center of the cell .",
    "we show the two velocity fields in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we characterize the velocity field by its maximum velocity @xmath52 and shear rate @xmath53 , which are defined by @xmath54 by varying the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 or @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can vary @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the velocity fields .    from the solved temperature field , we can calculate the heat transport , which is the heat conducted across the boundary @xmath55 .",
    "nu is therefore the ratio of the average of the magnitude of the vertical temperature gradient over the boundary @xmath55 to @xmath56 : @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the average over @xmath26 from 0 to @xmath3 .",
    "our goal is to study the dependence of nu on the peclet number pe @xmath59 and the normalized shear rate @xmath60 .",
    "we numerically solve @xmath27 for the two forms of @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the vertical and horizontal temperature profiles @xmath61 and @xmath62 . as was reported in turbulent convection experiments , the applied temperature difference concentrates in two narrow regions near the ` bottom ' and ` top ' boundaries @xmath55 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "interestingly , the circulation also induces a temperature difference between the two ` side ' boundaries @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for flows that are anticlockwise  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the side @xmath64 is colder than the side @xmath65 . the horizontal temperature profile @xmath62 resembles the vertical one @xmath61 in that it is almost constant = @xmath66 except for two small regions near the sides . in these two small regions , it is approximately linear in @xmath26 except at the boundaries where the horizontal gradient vanishes .",
    "hence , we approximate @xmath67 by @xmath68 where @xmath5 is about @xmath69 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    thus , there are also two thermal boundary layers of thickness @xmath70 at the ` side ' boundaries . furthermore , we find that nu is given by @xmath71 up to a factor @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath72 is weakly independent of @xmath74 and approaches @xmath75 as the viscous boundary layer thickness @xmath76 increases to 0.13  @xmath3  as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . defining @xmath77 to be the average thickness of the thermal boundary layer at the top and bottom boundaries",
    ", we see that the @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the side - wall thermal boundary layers are thicker than the top and bottom thermal boundary layers .",
    "we find that the functional form of nu(pe,@xmath74 ) depends crucially on the relative sizes of @xmath79 and @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath80 , nu scales with the shear rate : @xmath81 and the coefficient @xmath82 approaches 0.36 as @xmath83 increases to 0.13  @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for @xmath84",
    ", we see in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the dependence of nu on pe or @xmath74 for fixed @xmath83 is not a power law . for a short range of pe or @xmath74 ,",
    "the dependence might be described by an effective power law but the value of the effective exponent would depend on the range of pe or @xmath74 fitted .",
    "we shall understand these results in the following . since the velocity field is incompressible , eq .",
    "( [ adv - diff ] ) implies @xmath85 for any closed curve @xmath86 in the two - dimensional domain where @xmath87 is an outward normal . since we find that @xmath88 almost vanishes along @xmath39 , we choose @xmath86 to enclose the lower half of the unit cell  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . together with eq .",
    "( [ side_boundaries ] ) and the no - slip boundary condition , eq . ( [ surface ] ) then implies that @xmath89 thus , we can estimate nu by the heat transported across @xmath39 . using the antisymmetry of @xmath38 about @xmath40 and eq .",

    "( [ est ] ) , we have assumed that the parameters of the velocity field are chosen such that @xmath91 as in physical situations .",
    "the heat transported across @xmath39 is , therefore , contributed mainly by two ` jets ' of colder and hotter fluids moving down and up respectively along the two boundaries @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    using eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , we approximate @xmath38 by a linear function in @xmath26 for @xmath92 : @xmath93 hence , eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) , ( [ balance ] ) and ( [ est ] ) give @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we compare our estimated values of the coefficient @xmath95 with the computed values of @xmath82 .",
    "it can be seen that the two values agree within an error of 7% . moreover , the agreement is better for larger @xmath83 , as expected since the linear approximation eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) works better for @xmath96 for larger @xmath83 .    for @xmath97 , we need @xmath38 beyond the region where a linear approximation holds . as a first approximation",
    ", we take @xmath98 that is , we approximate the large - scale flow by a shear near the boundaries then followed by a band of circulation at the maximum velocity . as @xmath38 has to decay to zero towards the center of the cell , we expect the approximation eq .",
    "( [ uy_gen ] ) to work only for @xmath99 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ balance ] ) , ( [ est ] ) and ( [ uy_gen ] ) , we get a quadratic equation for nu . solving which gives @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "thus , nu does not have a power - law dependence on pe nor @xmath102 .",
    "physically , this is because we generally can not neglect the effect of the shear even when the edge of the side - wall thermal boundary layer is located at the band of maximum velocity of the large - scale flow .",
    "it is only in the limit pe@xmath103 that nu @xmath104 pe@xmath105 .",
    "away from this asymptotic regime , nu might be represented by an effective power law on pe or @xmath74 for fixed @xmath83 but the value of the effective exponent would depend on the range of pe or @xmath74 fitted . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we compare the numerical results to eq .",
    "( [ nu2 ] ) with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the agreement is not too bad for @xmath109 given that our approximation of @xmath38 being constant beyond the shear layer is rather crude .",
    "in turbulent convection , the heat transport is due both to the large - scale mean flow and the fluctuating part of the velocity field .",
    "our present work provides insights only to the heat transport by the large - scale mean flow .",
    "it is illuminating to see what results would be inferred if we neglect the effect of the fluctuating part of the velocity field .",
    "depending on the type of the viscous boundary layer , the strength and the shear rate would be related to each other .",
    "for example , if we follow grossmann and lohse to assume that viscous boundary layer is of blasius type@xcite : @xmath110 for moderate values of pr@xcite and that @xmath111 for very large values of pr@xcite , then @xmath112 our results eqs .",
    "( [ nu1 ] ) and ( [ nu2 ] ) would thus give nu as a function of pe and pr : @xmath113 for @xmath80 and @xmath114 for @xmath101 with @xmath115}\\ ] ] we emphasize that the non - power - law dependence on pr for @xmath97 echoes that the effect of the shear can not generally be neglected even when the edge of the side - wall thermal boundary layer is located at the band of the maximum velocity of the large - scale flow .",
    "next , we make use of a rigorous relation between the viscous dissipation and nu and ra , which is derivable from the equations of motion@xcite : @xmath116 ^ 2 \\rangle \\rangle = { \\kappa^2 \\over l^4 } ( { \\rm nu}-1 ) { \\rm ra } \\label{exact}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is an average over space * x * and time @xmath118 . neglecting the contribution from the fluctuating part of the velocity field to the viscous dissipation , we get @xmath119 for nu @xmath120 . using eqs .",
    "( [ gammape ] ) , ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ dom ] ) , we finally get @xmath121 @xmath122 for @xmath80 respectively for moderate and very large values of pr , and @xmath123 for @xmath101 . the results eqs .",
    "( [ moderatepr ] ) , ( [ largepr ] ) , and ( [ large ] ) , except for the non - power - law dependence on pr in eq .",
    "( [ large ] ) , resemble those obtained by grossmann and lohse@xcite , respectively for regimes @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , in which they took the boundary layer to dominate both the viscous and thermal dissipation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the heat transport by physical fluid flows whose velocity fields are prescribed to have both the two key characteristics of the large - scale mean flow observed in turbulent convection .",
    "the velocity fields that we have chosen are separable and incompressible circulating flows in a unit square cell .",
    "satisfying the no - slip boundary condition , they also generate a shear near the boundaries .",
    "overall , they are approximately a shear near the boundaries , almost constant with the maximum strength of circulation for a finite band , and then a decay towards the center of the cell .",
    "we focus on the functional dependence of nu on pe measuring the maximums strength of circulation and the normalized shear rate @xmath74 that characterize the velocity fields .",
    "we have shown that nu can be estimated by the heat transported across the mid - height of the unit square cell , which is in turn contributed mainly by two jets of hotter and colder fluids moving up and down the two sides .",
    "these two jets are confined to two narrow regions .",
    "that is , the velocity field also induces two thermal boundary layers at the side boundaries .",
    "these side - boundary thermal layers are thicker than those at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "it is then clear that the functional form of nu(pe,@xmath74 ) depends crucially on the relative sizes of the viscous boundary layer thickness @xmath83 and the thickness of the thermal boundary layers at the side boundaries @xmath70 . when @xmath80 , that is , the edge of the side - wall thermal boundary layer falls within the shear region of the large - scale flow , nu scales with @xmath74 to 1/3 and is very weakly dependent on @xmath83 or pe .",
    "when @xmath97 and the edge of the side - wall thermal boundary layer falls within the band of circulation with maximum strength , there is still contribution to the heat transport by the shear and nu depends on both pe and @xmath74 .",
    "the dependence is generally not a power law and scaling behavior is obtained only in the asymptotic regime pe@xmath103 .",
    "we have further discussed how our results are relevant to the problem of heat transport in turbulent convection . in turbulent convection ,",
    "the heat transport is due both to the large - scale mean flow and the fluctuating part of the velocity field . neglecting the effect of the fluctuating part of the velocity field , our results lead to results resembling those obtained by grossmann and lohse@xcite when they took the boundary layer to dominate both the viscous and thermal dissipation .",
    "it is not surprising that the boundary layer dominating the viscous dissipation is the same as the large - scale mean flow dominating the viscous dissipation since the gradient of the large - scale mean flow , which contributes to the viscous dissipation , concentrates in the boundary .",
    "our finding thus suggests that whether the boundary layer or the bulk dominates the thermal dissipation is physically equivalent to whether the large - scale mean flow or the fluctuating part of the velocity field dominates the heat transport .    we acknowledge d. lohse for pointing out to us that we can also derive eq .",
