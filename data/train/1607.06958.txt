    "the strong cp problem is one of the outstanding puzzle of particle physics today . it is a well - known",
    "fact that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) allows a cp violating term of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a constant parameter  @xcite .",
    "the stringent bound on the electric dipole moment of neutron implies that @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such a small value for @xmath1 is quite unnatural .",
    "this problem can be elegantly solved by the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism in which a global u(1)@xmath3 symmetry with a chiral anomaly is introduced and the cp violating @xmath1-term can be dynamically relaxed to zero  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding goldstone boson , the axion  @xcite remains massless at the classical level , but acquires a periodic potential and consequently a mass inversely proportional to the pq symmetry breaking scale , @xmath4 , due to non - perturbative qcd effect  @xcite .",
    "even though the original pq proposal with @xmath4 at the electroweak ( ew ) scale was soon ruled out by several experiments  @xcite , other variants of the pq mechanism circumvent the problem by creating a hierarchy between the pq breaking scale and the ew one via the introduction of a new standard model ( sm ) complex singlet field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) breaks the pq symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the scale of pq symmetry breaking is subjected to several observational constraints .",
    "for instance , the observation of the supernova sn1987a , white dwarfs and the globular clusters set a lower bound of @xmath5  gev on the scale of pq symmetry breaking  , where @xmath6 is the number of domain walls ; @xmath7 for ksvz models  @xcite , and @xmath8 for dfsz models  @xcite .",
    "we we elaborate on these models in appendix - a and b. ] ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . with such a high pq symmetry breaking scale , axion can be a good dark matter ( dm ) candidate  @xcite , whose couplings to other fields are suppressed by powers of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the energy stored in the coherent oscillations of axions today can make the entirety of the observed dm abundance for @xmath9  @xcite where @xmath10 is the axion misalignment angle at beginning of the axion oscillation phase .",
    "on the other hand , many puzzles of early universe cosmology can be solved by an early epoch of accelerated expansion , `` inflation '' ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "inflation is also responsible for seeding the primordial perturbations for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structures . during inflation ,",
    "if there exists any light field , such as moduli , whose mass is below @xmath11 , they obtain vacuum induced quantum fluctuations of @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 denotes the hubble parameter during inflation . in this case , such a light moduli can obtain large vev , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15  gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "typically , the moduli behaves like a condensate within our hubble patch  @xcite , and begins its coherent oscillations when the hubble expansion rate of the universe drops to the mass of the moduli .",
    "similarly , if the pq field is light compared to the hubble expansion rate during inflation , then the pq field can also be displaced from its minimum , which is determined by @xmath4  @xcite , and consequently after the end of inflation the pq field will start coherent oscillations when its mass would exceed the time dependent hubble scale .",
    "the pq field can also be displaced away from @xmath4 during inflation if it is coupled to the inflaton field  @xcite , and later starts oscillating once inflaton begins its own coherent oscllations around the minimum of its potential . if the initial vev of pq field during inflation is displaced by @xmath16 , the initial phase of oscillation takes place around the origin .",
    "this can lead to the restoration of the pq symmetry and formation of dangerous topological defects  @xcite   ( i.e. for ksvz - like models with only one extra heavy quark species ) , these defects are unstable and decay to cold axions leading to an upper bound on the pq breaking scale , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the cold axions abundance and @xmath19 is the observed abundance of cold dark matter ( cdm )  @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath20 ( i.e. for dfsz - like models or ksvz - like models with several extra heavy quark species ) , the topological defects are stable and dominate the energy density of the universe ruling out such scenario unless one fine - tunes a bias term that explicitly breaks the shift symmetry , and in this case @xmath4 is constrained to be less than @xmath21 in order to avoid the overproduction of axions  @xcite . ] .",
    "the non - thermal restoration of the pq symmetry can be avoided if the amplitude of the pq field at the beginning of the oscillation phase is less than @xmath22  @xcite or , if there is a coupling between the pq field and the total energy density of the inflaton , and the oscillation of the pq field is driven by a higher order term in the potential  @xcite .",
    "note that similar constraints would follow , if we had considered a moduli field instead of an inflaton field .",
    "once the amplitude of the pq field drops below @xmath4 , the oscillation of the field continues around its minimum at @xmath4 . in such a case",
    ", there will be no non - perturbative production of qcd axion during the second phase of the oscillation  @xcite , but it can still lead to dangerous consequences from a perturbative decay of the pq field .    in a wide range of parameter space ,",
    "the coherent oscillation of the pq field can decay dominantly into ultra - relativistic axions .",
    "if this decay occurs at sufficiently late times , the resultant axions will not thermalise with the plasma keeping their initial abundance and momenta .",
    "such hot axions will act as dark radiation , increasing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( dof ) , i.e. @xmath23 . the value of @xmath23 is constrained by the observation of cmb  @xcite , allowing us to put constraints on the pq parameter space .",
    "the constraints on the extra relativistic species induced by heavy decaying particles are extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "these include the discussion in the context of the supersymmetric axion models  @xcite , and in the context of the heavy moduli decay in string cosmology  @xcite , where reheating sm degrees of freedom remains a challenge .",
    "instead of considering these scenarios , where the mass of decaying particles is generically controlled by the supersymmetry breaking effects , here we focus on the standard non - supersymmetric pq mechanism , in which the decaying particle is identified as the radial component of the pq field .",
    "the mass of the radial field is determined by the self coupling constant and the pq symmetry breaking scale .",
    "we show that an upper bound on the reheating temperature can be placed , which is relevant to axion dm with a large decay constant .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we review the dynamics of the pq symmetry breaking followed by a brief review of axion thermalisation and thermal production in section  [ sec : th - prod ] . in section  [ sec : nonth - prod ] , we discuss the non - thermal production of ultra - relativistic axions from the coherent oscillation of the radial component of the pq field . we discuss the different constraints on the axion parameter space in section  [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "finally , we conclude our discussion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us now consider the dynamics of the pq symmetry breaking during the evolution of a real scalar field @xmath24 in the background .",
    "the field @xmath24 could be inflaton or moduli as such . our main focus in this paper is to understand the dynamics of pq field and @xmath24 field after inflation .",

    "this can also ameliorate the isocurvature bound on @xmath4 , since large @xmath33 reduces the power spectrum of isocurvature perturbation along the angular direction given by @xmath34  @xcite , which is bounded to be @xmath35 from cmb data  @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the pq symmetry gets broken after inflation leading to the formation of topological defects .",

    "we demand that the pq field does not come to dominate the energy density of the universe during the slow - roll phase , which constraints @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the typical value of @xmath42 during inflation .",
    "once the inflationary slow - roll conditions break down , the pq field starts oscillating . due to large amplitude , @xmath61 , the initial oscillations will take place around @xmath62 .",
    "this can result in large quantum amplification of the fluctuations in the pq field especially along the massless angular direction  @xcite , which may lead to the restoration of the pq symmetry and consequently the formation of potentially dangerous topological defects unless @xmath63  @xcite .",
