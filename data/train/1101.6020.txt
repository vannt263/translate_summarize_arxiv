    "herbig - haro ( hh ) objects are notable both for their high degree of collimation and their apparent `` knotty '' structure , as evident in observations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "knots are typically axially - aligned emission spots bright in h-@xmath0 and [ sii ] , thought to be a result of shock heating ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) . spacing between knots is usually of order the size of the knots themselves , though larger voids where little to no emission is present may be observed .",
    "the origin of the knotted structure remains under debate .",
    "several models have been proposed since their discovery @xcite ; an overview may be found in @xcite .    in @xcite , we proposed a generalization of the `` interstellar bullet '' model of @xcite .",
    "their model assumed a single , massive `` bullet '' ejected from a young stellar object ( yso ) source , moving through the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the model in @xcite assumed the launching velocity and density profile of a hh jet to vary on a scale less than the jet radius , producing a `` clumped '' jet .",
    "the model produces morphology similar both to observations and to jets seen in the lab setting , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the clumped jet model achieves complex structures reminiscent of that seen in observations , including nonaxial , co - moving bow shocks achieved without precession .",
    "our fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations utilize adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) in order to resolve clumps in the jet beam at sufficient resolution .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results presented in @xcite through a parameter space search designed to illuminate the role clump velocity dispersion , size , and density contrast play in the overall morphology . in ",
    "[ problem ] we describe the model and our numerical methods .",
    "  [ results ] highlights the results from the investigation , which are discussed in more quantitative detail in   [ analysis ] .",
    "we conclude in   [ discussion ] .",
    "the model employed is discussed in @xcite ; we briefly describe it here .",
    "constant inflow conditions are imposed on the left ( @xmath1 ) plane in a circle of radius @xmath2 , density @xmath3 , temperature @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 .",
    "starting at @xmath6 yr , at @xmath7 year intervals , spherical _ clumps _ are placed within the jet beam near the @xmath1 plane , with radius , density , temperature , and velocity @xmath8 , @xmath9 , & @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the values of these parameters are randomly chosen within certain bounds which differ depending on the simulation ; see table [ cj2_tab_parameters ] .",
    "there were 7 cases in all , which are discussed in detail later in this section .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 positions of the clumps also were randomly chosen , so long as a clump is placed entirely within the beam . in all cases , the ambient number density and temperature are @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 k , respectively . in all cases except case 5 , the jet number density , temperature , and velocity are @xmath16 @xmath14 , @xmath17 k , and @xmath18 km s@xmath19 ( @xmath20 au yr@xmath19 ) , respectively , producing an over dense ( @xmath21 ) , mach 30 jet .",
    "the radius of the jet was @xmath22 au . in case 5 ,",
    "the jet number density was changed to be @xmath23 @xmath14 .",
    "the simulations were performed using the _ _ astrobear _ _ code may be found online at http://www.pas.rochester.edu/@xmath24bearclaw/. a code - centered wiki is under active development , at http://clover.pas.rochester.edu/trac/astrobear ] computational code @xcite . in all cases except case 0e , the effects of radiative cooling is treated as a stiff source term based on the cooling curve of @xcite .",
    "case 0e includes a treatment of multiphysical dynamics , tracking helium and hydrogen ionization .",
    "advected tracers are used to track the clump material throughout the simulations .",
    ".physical parameters of the clumps instantiated in the simulations , normalized to the control jet values for radius , number density , and velocity of @xmath22 au , @xmath16 @xmath14 , and @xmath18 km s@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "values listed are minimums , means@xmath26standard deviation , and maximums for each case .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the role that different parameters play in the clumped jet model introduced in @xcite .",
    "we found the jet bow shock to be affected in many of the cases , with the smoothest bow shock occurring in case 1 ( excluding case -1 ) .",
    "when the clumps densities are kept fixed at @xmath27 , the role of velocity dispersion alone becomes apparent . with large dispersions as in case 4 ,",
    "the jet beam is partially disrupted , with roughly clump - sized cavities appearing both in the jet beam and in the jet bow shock .",
    "small dispersions , as in case 3 , on the other hand , do not affect the jet beam particularly but still have an effect on the jet bow shock .",
    "what if the clump density is not held fixed ?",
    "instead , we may consider a joint constraint on velocity , size , and density based on eq .",
    "[ cj2_tstar ] . in this case , the effects of the clumps are much more pronounced . in case 2 ,",
    "for example , which featured both high @xmath28 and high velocity dispersion , the clumps demonstrated an ability to completely disrupt the jet beam , injecting both clump and jet material laterally into the surrounding jet cocoon ( i.e. , the rarefied region swept over by the laterally - expanding jet bow shock ) .",
    "in contrast to case 3 , even when the velocity dispersion is small as in case 1 , the increased range of densities results in a modified jet morphology . as discussed , this is due primarily to the clump - clump collisions , which in case 1 do not allow all clumps to cross the length of the jet but instead forces mergers , like those seen near the head of the jet in fig .",
    "[ fig_vol ] .    however , a notable point is that , despite the variety of the cases mentioned above  and despite the jet beam disruption noted in case 2the most disparate case is case 5 . with these parameters ,",
    "the clumps are not numerous enough to mimic a jet beam .",
    "the fewer number of interactions results in an overall bow shock ( analogous to the jet bow shock of the other cases ) which is narrower or more slender .",
    "thus , one could imagine that if propagating through a medium which itself is heterogeneous as discussed in @xcite , this case would see the least degree of energy transfer between the chain of knots and the surrounding heterogeneity .",
    "we should note that with the parameters as chosen , the injected mass ( and therefore kinetic energy ) of case 5 is substantially less than that in the other cases",
    ". it would therefore be instructive to extend these simulations with a focus on the injected momentum or kinetic energy .",
    "recent high energy density laboratory astrophysics ( hedla ) investigations provide an unique window into the behavior of fully 3-d radiative hypersonic mhd jets .",
    "these experiments demonstrate that magnetized jet beams in the lab may rapidly break up into a sequence of quasi - periodic knots due to current driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "these knots may be displaced from the nominal jet axis and may propagate with varying velocities .",
    "this results in morphologies qualitatively reminiscent of hh - jet beams .",
    "the present simulations do not employ magnetic fields ; however , it remains an open question whether magnetic fields remain dynamically important on the length scales considered here ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems plausible that a process similar to what s observed in the lab could occur in the astrophysical context , beginning with a beam close to the central engine which becomes disrupted owing to the kink and sausage instabilities on small to intermediate scales .",
    "this would result in a series of knots which continue to evolve as they propagate away from the central engine .",
    "such a scenario would also explain the observed velocity differences between knots , attributable to the particulars of each knot s formation .",
    "the present simulations are an idealization of this model .    these simulations , as those in @xcite , feature on average a dozen computational zones per instantiated clump .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , when radiative cooling is important this resolution may not sufficiently resolve the dynamics .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite and references therein , higher resolution , leading to higher effective numerical reynolds number in an inviscid code such as @xmath29 , would allow faster mixing , but the gross morphology most likely would be little changed .",
    "the main effects we see in the simulations here have to do with the bulk mass of clumps impinging on their environment .",
    "the manner in which the subsequent mergers mix and intersperse certainly would be affected by higher resolution , and as such we have not attempted to quantify them at this stage .    finally , the simple linear model predicting the number of clump interactions would benefit and be improved by simulations of clump collisions .",
    "@xcite , among others , investigated the dynamics of clump - clump interactions in 2d axisymmetry without radiative cooling .",
    "they found , similar to the results in @xcite of adiabatic clumps , that after collision the clumps disrupted and dispersed in a short time after collision .",
    "when @xcite include radiative losses , the resulting collisions result in coalesce , not unlike the mergers seen in the present work .",
    "it therefore would be fruitful to reexamine the existing model with these and similar results in mind , in order to synthesize a more sophisticated model of clumped astrophysical jets .",
