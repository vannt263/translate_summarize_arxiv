    "quasar outflows have been considered as a primary feedback source to explain the co - evolution of the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies .",
    "theoretical studies and simulations suggested that kinetic power of order of only  1% of the eddington luminosity is deemed sufficient for significant feedback effects on the host galaxy ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ; di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ; moll et al .",
    "2007 ; hopkins & elvis 2010 ) . furthermore , in the past ten years",
    ", uv and x - ray spectroscopic studies have revealed powerful high - velocity outflows carrying kinetic power of at least a few percent of bolometric luminosity in some bright active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars ( e.g. , borguet et al . 2012 ; tombesi 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "finally , massive molecular outflows on the galactic scale were detected in infrared luminous quasars , which is thought in the early phase of nuclear activity , with velocities correlated with the agn luminosity ( e.g. , sturm 2011 ) .",
    "outflows may manifest themselves as blue - shifted absorption lines when they intercept the line - of - sight to the continuum source .",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) up to velocity in 0.2 c from the correspondent emission lines are seen in about 10 - 40% of quasar population ( e.g. gibson et al .",
    "2009 ; allen et al .",
    "2011 ) . technically , they are defined as absorption troughs with velocity widths @xmath32000 ^-1 kms@xmath4  at depths @xmath310 per cent below the continuum ( weymann et al . 1991 ) .",
    "most bal quasars display absorption lines of only high - ionization species , such as v1240 nv@xmath5 , iv1549 civ@xmath6  and iv1399 siiv@xmath7 , known as hibal ( weymann et al . 1991 ; gibson et al . 2008 ; filiz ak et al . 2013 ) , and a few percent also of low ionization species such as ii2798 mgii@xmath8   and iii1857 aliii@xmath9 , named as lobal ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; zhang et al .",
    "however , mass outflow rate and the kinetic power associated with bal outflows are poorly determined due to lack of density diagnostics or the distance to the central black hole .",
    "bal troughs are variable on time scales from several days to years , and the fraction of variable bals increases with increasing observing intervals ( gibson et al . 2008 ; capellupo et al .",
    "2011 ; wildy et al .",
    "so far , two mechanisms are invoked to explain the variability of bal troughs : ( 1 ) changes in the ionization of gas ; and ( 2 ) absorbing gas moving in and out of the line - of - sight . in the first case",
    ", the alteration of gas ionization can be caused by a varying incident ionizing continuum ( case 1a ) or the evolving gas density ( case 1b ) due to , e.g. , thermal instability ( waters et al .",
    "2016 ) . in either case",
    ", the variability of bal troughs can provide either important clues to origin or crucial diagnostics for the physical conditions of outflows ( lundgren et al .",

    "for example , in case 1a ) , the variability time scale will set an upper limit on recombination time scale , which in turn gives a lower limit on the gas density . in the second case , assuming a keplerian dominated transverse motion for the absorber , we can constrain the distance of the absorber to the central black holes using the variability time scale of the bal troughs ( moe et al .",
    "2009 ; capellupo et al .",
    "2011 ) . in order to use these constraints ,",
    "a first step is to establish which mechanism is responsible for the bal variability .",
    "these mechanisms predict very different relations between continuum and absortpion line variabilities . in case 1a ) , variability of continuum and absorption lines are highly correlated ; while in other two cases , they are independent ( see waters et al .",
    "2016 for thermal instability case ) . furthermore ,",
    "along the line sight , different part of outflows see the same ionizing continuum , thus different absorption components vary also coordinately in the case 1a ) , while in other two cases , we do not expect such coherent variations .",
    "previous studies showed that the same bal troughs of iv  civ  and iv  siiv  bals or different bal components of iv  civ  in one object vary in a coordinated manner ( strengthening or weakening ) ( e.g. filiz ak et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ; wildy et al .",
    "2014 ) , indicating that ionization change due to varying ionizing continuum plays important role ( hamann et al . 2011 ; wang et al .",
    "it is inconclusive whether variations of bal ew correlates with continuum flux in individual quasars ( as found in e.g , trevese et al .",
    "2013 ; capellupo , hamann & barlow 2014 ) .",
    "wang et al . ( 2015 , hereafter paper i ) presented a statistical study of ensemble correlation between bals and continuum for a large sample of variable bal quasars with multi - epoch spectroscopic dataset of the sdss dr10 .",
    "they found that the ews of the bals decrease ( increase ) statistically when the continuum brightens ( dims ) for about 70% bals , and concluded that varying ionizing continuum drove bal variability in most of these quasars .",
    "they also showed that emergence or disappearance of bals are also connected to the continuum variability .",
    "however , a number of issues have not been addressed in that paper .",
    "first , the coordinated variations of emission and continuum are also expected in the scenario of cloud moving in and out picture if bal outflows carry dust as suggested by some studies ( zhang et al .",
    "2015 ; he et al .",
    "2014 ; leighly et al .",
    "second , the relation between bal and continuum variability is not monotonic according to photoionization models ( see their figure 11 and also figure 3 in  3 ) .",
    "consequently , it lowers the ensemble correlation between bal and continuum variability .",
    "a quantitative analysis should take into account of this .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine the role of variation of continuum playing in the bal variabilities and give a quantitative estimation for the fraction of bal variability driven by the photoionization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the sample and data analysis in  2 .",
    "an indicator of the ionization state is described in  3 .",
    "the results are presented in  4 and  5 .",
    "the conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "we merged the bal quasar in the catalog of sdss data release 7 ( dr7 , shen et al .",
    "2011 ) with that of dr12 by pris et al . 2016 .",

    "we compared this catalog with the sdss spectroscopic catalog and selected quasars with multi - spectroscopic observations . to investigate the variability of iv  civ  and iv  siiv",
    ", we adopt a redshift cut 1.9 @xmath10 z @xmath10 4.7 . to ensure detection of major absorption lines , we only keep quasars with at least one spectrum with signal to noise snr @xmath310 .",
    "after these cuts , we obtain a sample of 2005 bal quasars with two spectra or more . for one quasar with m @xmath11 spectra ,",
    "there are @xmath12 spectra pairs . as a result , there are total 9918 spectrum pairs in the sample of 2005 bal quasars . in the following subsection",
    "we describe the method of construction of a variable absorption line quasar sample .",
    "one of the primary scientific goals of baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) is to search for the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) signal in the @xmath13  lyman@xmath13  forest .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , the fiber positions of boss quasar targets were purposefully offset in order to optimize the throughput of light at 4000 , while the standard stars used for flux calibration are positioned for 5400   ( dawson et al .",
    "2013 ) . as a result",
    ", there exists the systematic offest between the spectrophotometric flux calibrations of sdss and boss .",
    "the quasar locus for high redshift quasars overlaps with the stellar locus in sdss color - color space . as a result , many stars are targeted as quasars until the spectra were taken .",
    "these stars were observed in the same manner as the observed quasars ( harris et al .",
    "thus , they have the same systematic offset with the quasars in boss .",
    "we give an average correction to the boss quasar spectra .",
    "the correction is small at the bluest wavelength and up to about 17% at the reddest wavelength ( fig .",
    "13 of harris et al .",
    "2016 ) .      in order to determine the wavelength span of the iv  civ  and iv  siiv  bal trough",
    ", we fit the spectra using unabsorbed template quasar spectra as in paper i , which are drived from 38,377 non - bal quasars with @xmath14 and @xmath15 in sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) . like paper",
    "i , we fit these templates to the spectra using a double power - law function as a scale factor , @xmath16\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2000\\aa}\\right)^{a[2]}+       a[3]\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2000\\aa}\\right)^{a[4 ] } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where coefficients ( a[1],a[3 ] ) and exponents(a[2],a[4 ] ) are determined by minimizing @xmath17 .",
    "this fitting spans a wavelength range of 1150 to 2850  and we add a additional gaussian component at the @xmath13  lyman@xmath13 , v  nv , iv  siiv  and iv  civ  locations to the unabsorbed templates to improve the fits therein .",
    "we iteratively mask spectral pixels lower than the model with a significance of @xmath18 on the blue side of @xmath13  lyman@xmath13 , v  nv , iv  siiv , iv  civ  to exclude possible absorption lines .",
    "we select the best template according to the criterion of the maximum number of pixels within 1@xmath19 error as the final fitting .",
    "the fitting procedure is demonstrated in fig . 1 .    like paper i , we search contiguous deficient pixels for intrinsic absorption lines region of iv  civ  in the normalized spectrum .",
    "we screen the moderate to broad absorption lines , which are more likely intrinsic , deficiency over a width of @xmath20 , or 300 km  s@xmath4 in velocity , and statistically significant than 5@xmath19",
    ". then we check by eye to exclude the false ones , caused by an improper fit in most cases .",
    "the absorption line regions of iv  siiv  are defined according to the corresponding velocity of iv  civ .",
    "as described in paper i , in order to identify the variation region of iv  civ  bal , we select the higher @xmath21 spectrum of the pair of a quasar as a reference , and then rescale it using the double power - law function ( eq.[eq1 ] ) to account for potential variations of the continuum shape . as shown below , with this recipe we can fit the observations very well .",
    "examples of the fit are displayed in the figure 1 . to account for variations of emission line ew",
    ", we add / subtract a gaussian to / from the rescaled spectrum .",
    "we restrict the center of the gaussian to lie within @xmath22500 km / s of the line center at the source rest frame . the add / subtract gaussian",
    "will be used as an indicator of the increase or decrease of iv  civ  emission line ew . with this fit",
    ", we found that the scatter in the difference spectrum over emission - line regions is similar to that of continuum regions . compared with unabsorbed quasar template matching ,",
    "the rescaled reference matching usually produces a better fit outside the absorption line region . as a result",
    ", we will measure the absorption line variability from the difference spectrum rather than by comparing ews obtained in the template fitting .    to identify variable absorption - line components in the difference spectrum",
    ", we searched for contiguous negative and positive bins to determine the region of variable components ( paper i ) .",
    "we mark all pixels where the difference is larger than 5% of the average value and more than 3@xmath19 .",
    "adjacent marked pixels are then connected to form a variable region .",
    "then we expand such regime into neighboring pixels that have the same sign in the difference spectrum but at the less than 3@xmath19 significant level .",
    "after that , we merge the neighboring regions with the same variable sign and with a separation of less than four pixels",
    ". then it will generate the variable region of bal .",
    "after the visual check , a sample containing 2324 spectrum pairs from 843 quasars with detected variable absorption lines ( iv1549 civ@xmath6 ) and with the variations of continuum ( 1500 ) beyond 5% is identified ( fig .",

    "we consider a typical gas density of @xmath25 , since gas ionization is not sensitive to density at a given ionization parameter ( @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the source emission rate of hydrogen ionizing photons , r is the distance to the absorber from the source , c is the speed of light , and @xmath28 is the hydrogen number density ) . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , the iv  civ  and iv  siiv  column densities increase first , then reach a peak , and decrease after as the ionization parameter increases . due to the lower ionization potential , iv",

    "for each of the spectrum pairs , we take the mean value of the two observations @xmath31 as the indicator of the ionization state .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , the ionic column density of a specific species may respond to a continuum variation , negatively ( ew of the bal decreases when the continuum brightens ) or positively , depending on the ionization of absorbing gas .",
    "we divide the sample into two groups according to the pattern of the variation of bal with respect to that of continuum : the ew of the bal decreases ( increases ) when the continuum brightens ( dims ) as group t1 ; and the variation of ew and continuum in the opposite relation as group t2 . as a result , the distributions of r for t1 and t2 should be different , as long as the bal variabilities are driven by changes of the ionizing continuum .",
    "further more , the mean value of r distribution for t1 should smaller than that for t2 in statistics .",

    "<S> we present a statistical analysis of the variability of broad absorption lines ( bals ) in quasars using the large multi - epoch spectroscopic dataset of the sloan digital sky survey data release 12 ( sdss dr12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the sample into two groups according to the pattern of the variation of iv  civ  bal with respect to that of continuum : the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the bal decreases ( increases ) when the continuum brightens ( dims ) as group t1 ; and the variation of ew and continuum in the opposite relation as group t2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that t2 has significantly ( @xmath0 , student s t test ) higher ew ratios ( r ) of iv  siiv  to iv  civ  bal than t1 . </S>",
    "<S> our result agrees with the prediction of photoionization models that @xmath1 column density increases ( decreases ) if there is a ( or no ) @xmath1 ionization front while r decreases with the incident continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that bal variabilities in at least 80% quasars are driven by the variation of ionizing continuum while other models that predict uncorrelated bal and continuum variability contribute less than 20% . </S>",
    "<S> considering large uncertainty in the continuum flux calibration , the latter fraction may be much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> when the sample is binned into different time interval between the two observations , we find significant difference in the distribution of r between t1 and t2 in all time - bins down to a @xmath2 days , suggesting that bal outflow in a fraction of quasars has a recombination time scale of only a few days . </S>"
