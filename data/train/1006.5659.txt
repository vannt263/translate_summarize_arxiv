    "the clic linear collider is expected to probe physics at the multi - tev scale , complementing and extending the reach of the lhc on new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "if this new physics is manifested by a rich spectroscopic of new particles , as several models predict , their study will be a key part of the clic physics program . in this note",
    "we study the pair production of heavy supersymmetric higgs bosons , @xmath1 for the parameters of benchmark point  k , defined in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) extension in ref .",
    "this benchmark is characterised by very heavy supersymmetric particles , with kinematic thresholds for pair production between 2 and 3  tev .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath0 bosons have masses of 1141 and 1137  tev , respectively , with a natural width @xmath9 = 28  gev .",
    "the accurate determination of these masses is essential for outlining the susy profile and understanding the connection of susy with cosmology , through dark matter .",
    "the @xmath0 mass plays a special role in this respect .",
    "in fact , the relation between its mass , @xmath2 , and that of the lightest neutralino , @xmath10 , determines the cross section of the @xmath11 annihilation process in the early universe , which could have been responsible for determining the amount of relic dark matter we observe in the universe today  @xcite . pair production of heavy neutral higgs bosons at the linear collider has already been studied for several scenarios with lighter particles  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is interesting for assessing the detector requirements in terms of @xmath12-tagging efficiency , since the signal has four @xmath12 jets and small production cross section , jet clustering , di - jet invariant mass reconstruction and detector time stamping capabilities in presence of two - photon machine - induced background .",
    "for this study , signal events are generated with isasugra  7.69  @xcite and pythia  6.125  @xcite .",
    "the observed signal cross section at 3  tev is 0.3  fb , accounting for the clic luminosity spectrum .",
    "the main sm background processes are generated with pythia  6.125 .",
    "in addition , the irreducible inclusive @xmath13 sm background is generated with comphep  @xcite at the parton level and subsequently hadronised with pythia .",
    "the number of events generated for the various processes considered here and their cross sections are given in table  [ tab : mcstat ] .",
    "beamstrahlung effects are included using calypso for the clic  2008 accelerator parameters  @xcite .",
    "we assume the beams to be unpolarised .",
    "events are processed through full detector simulation using the geant-4-based mokka  @xcite program and reconstructed with marlin - based  @xcite processors assuming a version of the ild detector  @xcite , modified for physics at clic .",
    "a total of @xmath5100k sm and susy events have been generated , fully simulated , reconstructed and analysed ( see table  [ tab : mcstat ] ) .",
    ".summary of simulated samples [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fitm ]    while performances are comparable in absence of background , the statistical accuracy of the mass measurement is more stable with the amount of overlayed background when using the semi - inclusive anti - kt method .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is measured with a statistical accuracy of @xmath5  3  gev in absence of @xmath7 background , which increases to @xmath5  5  gev for 20  bxs of overlayed background .",
    "a @xmath5  3  @xmath14 systematic upward shift of the fitted mass value for 20 or more bunch crossings of background , which appears for the 4-jet clustering method , is removed by using the semi - inclusive anti - kt clustering and the fitted mass remains within less than 1  @xmath14 from its simulated value .     as a function of the @xmath12-tagging efficiency per jet , @xmath15 , for 20  bx of @xmath7 background overlayed.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    finally , we repeat the analysis by changing the @xmath12-tagging efficiency per jet , @xmath15 , in the range 0.75 @xmath16 0.95 and study the change in the statistical accuracy on @xmath2 as a function @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig : effb ] ) .",
    "the process @xmath1 has been studied for the parameters of a dark matter motivated , high mass susy scenario with @xmath2 = 1141  gev .",
    "the analysis is based on fully simulated and reconstructed events and includes both physics backgrounds and machine - induced @xmath7 events .",
    "clic at 3  tev can study the production of pairs of heavy higgs particles with high accuracy up to masses close to the production kinematic threshold .",
    "event shape discriminating variables and jet flavour tagging efficiently reduce the sm and susy backgrounds to achieve a good signal - to - background ratio in the signal region at high mass .",
    "a semi - inclusive jet clustering using a cone - like algorithm in cylindrical coordinates helps in reducing the impact of overlayed events and ensure a stable , unbiased mass determination up to largest number of overlayed bunch crossings considered in this study . due to the favourable kinematics of the signal events ,",
    "the di - jet invariant mass resolution can be significantly improved by performing a constrained kinematic fit , accounting for beamstrahlung .",
    "this fit further mitigates the impact of overlayed @xmath7 background up to @xmath5  20 - 30  bxs , corresponding to detector time stamping accuracies of 10 - 15  ns . under these conditions ,",
    "the @xmath0 mass can be determined with a statistical accuracy of @xmath173 - 5  gev for an integrated luminosity of 3  ab@xmath6 .",
    "this accuracy matches that required for obtaining predictions on the relic dark matter density in the universe from collider data with a precision comparable to that presently achieved in the study of the cosmic microwave background with the wmap satellite data  @xcite .",
    "the results reported in this note can be further improved .",
    "the particle flow algorithm still needs to be optimised for jets of @xmath18(1  tev ) .",
    "explicit @xmath12-tagging has yet to be performed and can profit from the considerable decay length of the energetic @xmath12 hadrons .",
    "the jet clustering algorithm can be further optimised for the reconstruction of events in presence of a diffuse background , as in the case of a large number of overlayed @xmath7 events .",
