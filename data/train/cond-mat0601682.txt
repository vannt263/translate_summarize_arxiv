    "anomalous behavior of heavy fermion ( hf ) metals has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental interest over the past 30 years since their discovery@xcite . due to the almost localized nature of f - electron bands , electrons in these materials",
    "have strong coulomb interactions , and exhibit a variety of very unusual properties , including heavy effective mass of carriers ( with @xmath4 ) , non - fermi liquid ground state properties@xcite , nontrivial magnetic order ( proposed for upt@xmath5 , uru@xmath6si@xmath6@xcite ) , and unconventional superconductivity , observed in most , if not all of hf superconductors ( see , for example , refs @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental interest in these materials has been focused on the quantum phase transitions .",
    "quantum critical anomalous power law behavior with temperature of thermodynamic , magnetic , and transport properties@xcite is observed in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition in hf compounds such as cecu@xmath6si@xmath6@xcite , cecu@xmath7au@xmath8@xcite , ybrh@xmath6si@xmath6@xcite , or cecoin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the surprising experimental discovery is that the quantum criticality in heavy fermion metals is also unconventional , i.e. , it does not follow the usual hertz - millis@xcite scaling analysis of a magnetic quantum critical point . instead",
    ", the fluctuations remain local , as it was demonstrated in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite , which strongly suggests a kondo - type local quantum criticality@xcite .",
    "the most interesting question remains the formation and the origin of heavy mass in these materials .",
    "nakatsuji , pines , and fisk@xcite(npf ) have recently shown that our understanding of kondo lattices is incomplete .",
    "npf propose that formation of heavy mass in heavy fermion materials ( in particular , in ce@xmath0la@xmath1coin@xmath2 and ceirin@xmath2 ) , which happens at a crossover temperature @xmath9 , can be described by a phenomenological theory similar in spirit to landau theory of superfluidity@xcite .",
    "the npf two - fluid phenomenological model@xcite states that thermodynamic , magnetic , and transport properties of kondo lattices can be described as a sum of two independent contributions , one involving the hf liquid , the other a lattice of weakly interacting kondo impurity centers .",
    "the relative fraction @xmath10 of the coherent hf state plays the role of the order parameter , which develops below the coherence temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "we demonstrate below that the same type of phenomenology directly follows from the lattice analogue of the slave boson broken symmetry ansatz of read and newns@xcite and coleman@xcite .",
    "the order parameter , the slave boson average , gives rise to the coherent heavy fermion liquid component , while the contribution from almost flat f - electron bands accounts for the kondo impurity component .",
    "although no actual symmetry breaking occurs in this case , an analog of landau two - fluid model in superconductors arises in the slave boson language .",
    "the heavy fermion liquid contribution corresponds to the bose - condensate of slave bosons , while the kondo impurity contribution is a complete analogue of the normal part@xcite .",
    "while the slave boson language provides a very attractive physical explanation of the npf phenomenology@xcite , in does not completely agree with it .",
    "we provide a detailed comparison of the slave boson results with the npf phenomenology in the summary .",
    "theoretical approach to understanding the physics of hf usually starts with the kondo lattice , or more general periodic anderson@xcite model hamiltonian , @xmath11 where    @xmath12    here the creation and annihilation operators for the f - electrons , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , carry the site index @xmath15 , and there is a coulomb interaction at each site for the f - electrons . the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to delocalized bloch states .",
    "the hybridization term @xmath18 accounts for the @xmath19 hybridization between the f - electrons and the bloch states : @xmath20 both anderson and kondo models have been solved exactly for a single f - electron site ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) . even though the bethe ansatz solution is by no means easy , most of our basic theoretical knowledge about kondo systems is inferred from it .",
    "unfortunately , exact solution can not be obtained for a periodic lattice , where correlations involve several conduction and f - electron spins .",
    "nevertheless , it can be treated quite successfully using various approximate methods , such as the non - crossing approximation , the @xmath3 approach@xcite , or dynamical mean field theory@xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath21 slave boson approach was developed in the mid-80-s by a number of authors@xcite for single impurity kondo and anderson models , and was later applied to lattices @xcite .",
    "the result of this approach for the single impurity models has been shown to approximate well exact results at both low and high temperatures@xcite . following these references",
    ", we can rewrite the periodic anderson model eq.([theh ] ) in the slave boson language .",
    "since the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath22 is very large for f - electron materials , it is usually taken as infinite .",
    "then the creation and annihilation operators for @xmath10-electrons need to be applied with special projection operators , which project out doubly occupied @xmath10-electron states@xcite",
    ". a convenient way to deal with this hamiltonian @xcite is to introduce a new slave boson field @xmath23 , which creates a hole on site @xmath15 , and to rewrite the anderson hamiltonian in a way which allows the @xmath3 expansion in the number of orbitals . as a result",
    ", the infinite-@xmath22 anderson model takes the following form : @xmath24 + \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{\\bm{k } , \\bm{q } , m } \\left ( c^{\\dagger}_{\\bm{k } m } f_{\\bm{q } m } b^{\\dagger}_{\\bm{q } - \\bm{k } } + h.c .",
    "\\right ) . \\label{slb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is a spin index , which runs from @xmath26 to @xmath21 ( i.e. , we assume @xmath21 degenerate f - levels * and * @xmath21 conduction bands ) , and the sums for @xmath27 and @xmath28 run over the brillouin zone .",
    "the absence of doubly occupied states is ensured by a constraint@xcite for every @xmath10-site @xmath15 : @xmath29 the large-@xmath21 slave boson formulation and the @xmath3 expansion around it have many well - known difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , the results of this model capture the low temperature heavy fermi liquid properties of kondo lattices rather well , and agree with many experiments@xcite .",
    "the mean field approach starts with a replacement of the slave boson operators with their averages @xcite , @xmath30 after taking into account the constraint eq.([constr ] ) , the resulting hamiltonian then can be written as : @xmath31 , \\label{mfh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the renormalized @xmath10-energy level .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fixed by the mean field equations , which are obtained by minimizing the free energy .",
    "a serious well - known limitation of the @xmath3 slave boson approach arises from the necessity to satisfy the constraint eq.([constr ] ) . according to quantum mechanics , the phase of the boson field is conjugate to the number operator for it .",
    "thus , a state in which the boson has a definite phase , such as one introduced by the usual slave boson mean field ansatz eq.([brs ] ) , results in infinite uncertainty for the boson number operator , and necessarily violates the local constraint eq.([constr ] ) .",
    "this introduces unphysical divergences in correlation functions , which do nt have direct physical meaning .",
    "these divergences must cancel for all physical properties . according to read@xcite , divergent goldstone mode phase fluctuations act to restore the true symmetry of the system , and @xmath34 .",
    "these phase fluctuations can be integrated out in the functional integral formalism , while the ansatz eq.([brs ] ) will hold for the boson amplitude . in this sense , this phase transition is similar to the kosterlitz - thauless phenomenon . in agreement with x - ray orthogonality catastrophe@xcite ,",
    "the local spin correlations in the single impurity model are critical , i.e. , have a power law decay at large times @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the constraint lead to large deviations from mean field at temperatures @xmath35 . nevertheless , if the limit @xmath36 is taken at finite filling @xmath37 , the mean field solution for a single impurity anderson model approaches the bethe ansatz solution at both high and low temperature end @xcite , with most deviations occurring around the mean field transition temperature @xmath38 .",
    "the convergence is excellent at low temperatures , although it remains rather poor at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this well - known problem with the slave boson method has prevented the development of the two - fluid microscopic model in the past .",
    "in particular , the kondo gas thermodynamic contribution from almost flat band , which appears already in the tree approximation , has always been dismissed as small , as an artifact of the above mentioned problem with the constraint , eq.([constr ] ) .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian eq.([mfh ] ) can be diagonalized by the canonical transformation , which results in a well known@xcite spectrum with a gap , @xmath40 the new energy spectrum gives rise to the mass enhancement given by @xmath41 which becomes rather dramatic in the kondo regime .",
    "it is convenient to introduce re - defined bare - fermion green s functions , @xmath42 where the thermal average is taken in a system described by eq.([mfh ] ) and @xmath43 is imaginary time . transforming to matsubara frequencies ,",
    "it is easy to find : @xmath44 the mean field parameters are determined by minimizing the free energy for the hamiltonian in eq.([mfh ] ) , which diagrammatically leads to vanishing of the sum of the `` tadpole '' graphs@xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath37 is the filling factor , @xmath46 .",
    "for free f - electrons above @xmath9 , eq.([second ] ) gives : @xmath47 so that the entropy for the f - levels @xmath48 setting the filling @xmath46 gives @xmath49 .",
    "exact entropy at high temperatures is not hard to find - one has n half - filled bands and @xmath50 coming from each @xmath21-fold degenerate f - level .",
    "thus , @xmath51 and we make a mistake of the order of @xmath52 in the entropy when we do mean field . in coleman",
    "approach@xcite the @xmath3 expansion takes place at a given @xmath37 , and @xmath37 is set to @xmath3 in the end .",
    "formally this gives a correction @xmath53)},\\ ] ] which is @xmath54 , which makes such @xmath3 expansion somewhat better suited for calculating finite temperature properties@xcite .",
    "however , the two - component physics is not evident in the coleman approach .",
    "the reason is that the fermi liquid sommerfeld expansion , which appears as an expansion in @xmath52 in the read and newns @xcite approach , becomes divergent at @xmath55 in the coleman approach .",
    "hence , the fermi liquid contribution can not be easily identified . in what follows ,",
    "we use the approach of read and newns@xcite to calculate two - component thermodynamics at the mean field level .",
    "the mean field equations eqs([first]),([second ] ) , together with the conservation of the total number of particles , @xmath56 = const , \\label{third}\\ ] ] define the order parameter for the second order phase transition in the slave boson method .    transforming the integration variable in the mean field equations eqs([first]),([second])to the new energy spectrum eq.([sp1 ] ) , @xmath57 ,",

    "one can simplify the gap equation eq.([gap0 ] ) in the kondo regime , where @xmath80 assuming a square band @xmath81 , following newns and read@xcite , keeping the leading terms in @xmath82 , @xmath83 the third equation , eq.([third ] ) , determines the shift of the chemical potential in the slave boson phase transition . in the kondo limit",
    "the number of electrons per @xmath10-level approximately stays at @xmath26 , and no significant shift of the chemical potential occurs .",
    "thermodynamic properties can easily be calculated from the mean field free energy for the hamiltonian eq.([mfh ] ) . from luttinger functional",
    ", we can write for the grand free energy density without the small free conduction electron contribution : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the grand free energy density for free non - hybridized f - centers , @xmath86 is the effect of hybridization ( mixed contribution ) .",
    "since @xmath85 corresponds to a free fermion at renormalized energy @xmath32 with respect to chemical potential , @xmath87 the third term in eq.([therm ] ) comes from the energy shift due to a slave boson average .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath86 can be expressed through the mixed green s function , @xmath88 we note that the rhs of this equation corresponds to the green s function expression in eq.([second ] ) .",
    "we can use eq.([second ] ) to replace the expression under the integral . since from eq.([second ] ) @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the density of f - levels . as a result",
    ", we easily obtain : @xmath92 houghton , read , and won@xcite have found that a similar expression for the grand free energy for a single - impurity model holds to two loops .",
    "thermodynamics is obtained , as usual , by differentiating the grand free energy with respect to temperature :    @xmath93    comparing this with expression eq.([haha ] ) for @xmath94 , and keeping the terms of lowest order in @xmath82 ( the first term is then small compared with the last term ) , we can write : @xmath95 or @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ". the heat capacity can be found by differentiating the entropy @xmath99 :    @xmath100    where we have neglected all terms smaller in @xmath101 in the first part , although all of them can be written out in the same fashion : @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the usual heavy fermi liquid contribution , @xmath104 while @xmath105 a factorized contribution .",
    "we note that unlike ref.@xcite , the dominant contribution in @xmath52 comes from differentiating the order parameter @xmath106 , @xmath107    in magnetic field we can write , neglecting free conduction electron contribution : @xmath108 now , @xmath21 in mf equations is replaced by sum over different @xmath109 . taking a partial derivative with respect to @xmath110",
    ", we find the magnetic moment : @xmath111 for small h , @xmath112 this obviously separates into two contributions . after some simple algebra , we find that the bulk spin susceptibility also has two separate contributions : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 is the mass enhancement at @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the second term on the rhs corresponds to the typical curie impurity contribution .",
    "a correct logarithmic correction to it appears in the next order in @xmath3@xcite    the origin of the two components in thermodynamics is shown schematically on fig.[2comp ] .",
    "indeed , the new energy spectrum for free fermions gives a singularity in density of states , @xmath118.\\ ] ] this singularity contributes to thermodynamic properties . since the mean field equations are derivatives of the free energy , the singularities that are encountered are of the same type as those for @xmath32 and @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the final results can be expressed in terms of @xmath106 .",
    "comparing the mean field results with experimental phenomenology of ref .",
    "@xcite , we find many similarities .",
    "for example , thermodynamics for the kondo lattice in the slave boson approach clearly factorizes into the kondo impurity and heavy electron liquid contributions .",
    "similar to situation in superconductivity this factorization is a direct result of the appearance of anomalous mixed averages of the type @xmath119 , which produces the energy gap , or the mean field order parameter @xmath94 , which corresponds to the fraction of the kondo liquid , eq.([fract ] ) .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath120 for @xmath121 , which is different from that given by eq.([haha ] ) , was found by fitting experiments in the 1 - 1 - 5 family in ref.@xcite . in case of @xmath122 ( @xmath123 )",
    "we find that numerically eq.([haha ] ) gives an order parameter which is almost linear ( see fig.[order ] )      the spin susceptibility @xmath124 follows the experimental behavior , and the behavior of thermodynamic functions factorizes into two components as well .",
    "clearly this is a very rough approximation , and many effects observed experimentally in ref.@xcite are not captured .",
    "for example , at zero temperature we find that @xmath125 , and the kondo impurity contribution is absent , unlike the limit @xmath126 found in ref .",
    "this discrepancy could , in principle , be explained by disorder , which would produce a finite population of the dos peak at zero temperature .",
    "we also note that the above model is considerably oversimplified .",
    "for example , the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath127 was neglected . in a realistic case",
    "@xmath128 may have zeroes on the fermi surface , which will lead to a @xmath129-dependent energy gap with a nodal structure , similar to that observed in unconventional superconductors .",
    "we also find that thermodynamics ( @xmath130 , @xmath99 , etc . ) does not completely follow the npf phenomenology .",
    "while the separation in two components is always present , we found that it is necessary to differentiate @xmath120 to get the correct answer for some quantities .",
    "it is also , perhaps , necessary to get to the next approximation , in order to find the log(t ) dependence of effective mass , observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "calculation of transport properties requires going beyond the mean field approximation @xcite , which , in principle , could also explain @xmath131 without introducing disorder .",
    "nevertheless , this approach can be regarded as the first approximation to understanding experimental results .",
