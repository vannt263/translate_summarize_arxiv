    "their description within the framework of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) has made substantial progress in the last three decades @xcite .",
    "the most common approach is hedin s gw approximation @xcite , which describes the response of the remaining electrons by a dynamically screened coulomb potential @xmath2 .",
    "the self - energy operator @xmath3 of an excited particle is thereby given by @xmath4 with the single - particle green s function @xmath5 .",
    "its numerical implementation @xcite usually yields single - particle excitation energies in good agreement with angle - resolved or inverse photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the optically excited quasielectron - quasihole pairs show additional interactions .",
    "they are described by the so called polarization function @xmath6 , which obeys a bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite .",
    "apart from the bare electron - hole exchange , which can be identified with crystal local - field effects ( lfes ) @xcite , its kernel is given by the derivative @xmath7 which is usually replaced by the leading term @xmath8 .",
    "it clearly represents the screened coulomb attraction between quasielectrons and quasiholes @xcite .",
    "optical spectra of real materials can be calculated from first principles by solving the eigenvalue problem ( evp ) for an effective two - particle hamiltonian @xmath0 corresponding to a reformulated bse .",
    "the eigensystem of @xmath0 then can be used to obtain a spectral representation of @xmath6 .",
    "usually , one of the following numerical approaches is applied to calculate @xmath6 or the directly related frequency - dependent dielectric function @xmath9 : ( i ) the explicit diagonalization of @xmath0 ( solving the evp directly @xcite ) , ( ii ) the iterative haydock method @xcite , or ( iii ) a time - evolution algorithm that is based on an initial - value formulation of the fourier - transformed dielectric function @xcite . meanwhile , the applications extend also to rather complex materials and structures such as semiconductor surfaces @xcite , nanocrystals and molecules @xcite , or even ice and water @xcite .",
    "the most important changes in the optical spectra with respect to the independent - particle limit concern a general redshift of the transition energies and a redistribution of oscillator strength towards lower energies @xcite .    for some systems also bound states of the electron - hole pairs  so called excitons @xcite  form and can be observed in optical spectra below the qp absorption edge .",
    "thereby , two fundamentally different types of excitons  the frenkel and the wannier - mott type  are distinguished .",
    "excitons of the frenkel type emerge in systems where the gap is confined by rather localized electronic states , as it is found for surfaces of covalently bonded semiconductors @xcite , insulators with strong ionic bonds @xcite , or crystals with hydrogen - bridge bonds @xcite . for materials with a pronounced dispersion of the first conduction band excitons of the wannier - mott type @xcite can form below the gap .",
    "they give rise to a hydrogen - like spectrum of pair eigenvalues and , in contrast to the frenkel type , an electron - hole distance much larger than the lattice constant .",
    "typically , their binding energies are much smaller than those of frenkel - like excitons .",
    "nevertheless , the lowest excitonic states can be probed by a variety of spectroscopic techniques .",
    "however , first - principles calculations , as outlined above , remain a challenging task especially for wannier - mott - like excitons with binding energies below 0.1  ev .",
    "the most important limitation is due to the high @xmath1-point densities required for sampling the brillouin zone ( bz ) , in order to describe the localization of the excitonic wave function in the fourier space sufficiently .",
    "the number of @xmath1 points directly relates to the rank @xmath10 of the bse hamiltonian , causing extreme demands in terms of storage and cpu time for the calculation of the spectra .",
    "the latter one rapidly becomes the limiting factor , since , of the previously discussed approaches , only the direct diagonalization of @xmath0  involving computational costs scaling like @xmath11  can be employed in the computation of bound pair excitations .",
    "attempts have been made to solve the problem by introducing an interpolation scheme for the electron - hole interaction @xcite or by @xmath1-point samplings restricted to only a small part of the bz @xcite .",
    "still , the question how the complete electronic structure influences the bound pair excitations and their the oscillator strengths remains open .",
    "also the effects of electron - hole exchange on the excitons @xcite have been studied little so far by a combination of _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations and the bse treatment of the two - particle excitations .",
    "another important point concerns the prediction of excitonic effects , e.g. binding energies and oscillator strengths , for semiconductors such as inn , whose sample quality does currently not allow their measurement .",
    "also the influence of polytypism of a material remains an open question .    in order to reduce the computational demands necessary for systematic studies addressing the aforementioned questions ,",
    "we combine the use of special @xmath1-point sets and an iterative matrix - diagonalization scheme , obtaining a computationally very efficient approach for the calculation of excitonic states below the absorption edge .",
    "the methodology of this approach is described in detail in sec .",
    "the computational details of the underlying _ ab initio _ calculations are summarized in sec .",
    "iii , before in sec .",
    "iv.a the approach is applied to and tested by means of the wannier - mott model exciton .",

    "the inclusion of excitonic effects in optical spectra requires to go beyond the independent-(quasi)particle approximation ( iqa ) for the polarization function @xmath6 by taking into account the electron - hole attraction and exchange . for this purpose",
    "a bse for the irreducible polarization can be derived from mbpt @xcite , @xmath12 with the iqa polarization function @xmath13 , the statically screened coulomb potential @xmath2 , and the bare coulomb potential @xmath14 without its long - range fourier component @xmath15 . for a detailed derivation and a generalization for collinear spin polarization we like to refer to @xcite .",
    "a commonly adopted basis for representing the bse is given by the bloch states @xmath16 of the crystal problem , characterized by the band index @xmath17 and a wave vector of the first bz @xmath1 .",

    "the latter truncation is achieved by introducing a cutoff energy for the transition energies of non - interacting pairs . for practical reasons we define this bse cutoff @xmath41 with respect to the single - particle energies without qp corrections , corresponding to the kohn - sham eigenvalues , @xmath42 . for the @xmath1 discretization",

    "the singularity correction decreases with increasing number of @xmath1 points , converging to zero in the limit of vanishing @xmath58 distance . in the case of regular",
    "@xmath1-point meshes the singularity correction leads to a rigid shift of the eigenvalues to lower energies @xcite . for inhomogeneously distributed @xmath1-point sets , however , its value is not constant over all @xmath1 points",
    ". therefore , we do not adopt the spherical approximation in order to avoid spurious effects on the absolute values and relative positions of the eigenvalues .",
    "instead , we carry out the six - dimensional integral numerically , taking into account the actual size and shape of @xmath43 .",
    "since the numerical convergence of these integrals is utterly slow but perfectly linear when plotted over the sampling - point distance along one direction , we extrapolate the value of the singularity correction from the results of two calculations using @xmath59 and @xmath60 sampling points inside @xmath43 .",

    "_ @xcite devised an efficient approach , scaling like @xmath68 with the dimension @xmath10 of the excitonic hamiltonian .",
    "this approach avoids the direct diagonalization of @xmath0 by reformulating as an initial - value problem and solving that .",
    "it , however , comes at the price of losing the explicit knowledge of the exciton excitation energies @xmath69 and wave - function coefficients @xmath70 .",
    "further , a certain broadening @xmath71 of the optical transitions is mandatory for the numerical convergence of the algorithm . for large and complex systems , where @xmath10 can reach up to @xmath72 or more ,",
    "the computational costs for a full diagonalization of @xmath0 become prohibitive due to their @xmath11 scaling .",
    "this renders the time evolution the only feasible approach for the calculation of the df .",
    "another method , also aiming at the df only , was proposed by benedict _",
    "it is , however , hard to compare in terms of computational efficiency due to its implementation in real space .          often , not the df itself but isolated exciton levels , especially bound states with pair excitation energies @xmath25 below the lowest qp gap , are of interest . due to the limited spectral resolution and the possibility of vanishing oscillator strength ,",
    "such excitations can not be studied with the time - evolution method .",
    "the same holds for the analysis of excitonic wave functions , which requires the knowledge of the respective eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in those cases",
    "needs to be solved directly , raising again the problem of excessive computational costs for complex systems . for wannier - mott - like excitonic states near the absorption edge ,",
    "usually a fairly small bse cutoff can be used in order to reduce the dimension of @xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a large number of @xmath1 points is required in the computations to ensure a sufficiently large crystal volume to accommodate the exciton , which can extend over several thousand unit cells according to exciton localization radii in the range of @xmath73  .    for excitons , numerical convergence",
    "is typically obtained for dimensions of @xmath0 somewhere in the range of @xmath74 .",
    "direct matrix diagonalization schemes can be used at the lower end of the aforementioned range with computational times of a few cpu hours .",
    "however , due to the rapid @xmath11 increase of computational costs , already problems of mid - range size are computationally too expensive for systematic studies .    given the combination of a large - rank hamiltonian and the interest in only a few of the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors renders the problem strongly reminiscent of the kohn - sham problem in dft .",
    "of course , this refers only to the dimensions of the problems , because in fact the bse - evp is less complicated , since no self - consistent update of the hamiltonian is required . using this observation",
    ", we propose to employ iterative minimization techniques similar to those used in dft for the study of distinct exciton levels .",
    "these are based on the minimization of the ritz functional , @xmath75=\\frac{{\\langle { \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\lambda}}\\,|}\\hat{h}{|\\,{\\tilde{\\phi}^{\\lambda}}\\rangle}}{{\\langle { \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\lambda}}| { \\tilde{\\phi}^{\\lambda}}\\rangle}},\\ ] ] with the trial vector @xmath76 .",

    "we follow the scheme devised by kalkreuter and simma @xcite . there",
    ", consecutive conjugate gradient ( cg ) steps are performed together with intermediate diagonalizations of @xmath0 in the low dimensional subspace @xmath80 , so called subspace rotations ( sr ) .",
    "the dimension @xmath81 of the subspace , thereby , roughly corresponds to the number of desired eigenvalues ( typically @xmath82 ) .",
    "we have chosen a cg - based algorithm for the sake of simplicity and due to its robustness .",
    "other algorithms , however , can be used as well and might also improve performance .",
    "as already stressed above , in practice only a limited number of excitonic levels are of interest for the study of excitons .",
    "further , this number does usually not depend on @xmath10 , the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , under the assumption that the number of total cg steps is independent of @xmath10 , the theoretical operation - count scaling of the cg+sr algorithm is found to be @xmath68 .",
    "the reason is that it involves only matrix - vector and vector - vector operations of dimension @xmath10 and diagonalizations of fixed - size @xmath83 matrices . in general",
    ", the assumption of a constant number of total cg steps , is of course , not true , since it is determined by the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "however , it is found that the convergence depends little on the matrix dimension , but more on its conditioning .",
    "figure [ fig : time.vs.dim ] confirms that the cg+sr method scales basically like @xmath68 .",
    "the crossover point is found below @xmath84 when competing with full diagonalization , or at 3000 when comparing against the lapack @xcite cheevx routine for calculating selected eigenvalues and vectors of randomly filled hermitian matrices .",
    "moreover , the cg+sr algorithm can be easily parallelized .",
    "mpi parallelization can help to meet the high memory demands for solving the bse by utilizing distributed memory .",

    "the @xmath1 points of the coarse mesh are indicated by unfilled circles , those of the refined mesh by red dots .",
    "further , the boundaries of the bz and its inner part are indicated . following the notation introduced in the text , the mesh shown here",
    "would be referred to as : hybrid @xmath85 .",
    "the right panel shows the localization of the wave function for an 1@xmath86 wannier - mott exciton ( with the parameters as in sec .",
    "[ sec : res : wm ] ) in reciprocal space . ]    even though the algorithm suggested in the preceding section keeps the computational costs for the calculation of excitons tractable , one drawback of the evp remains  its extreme memory demands .",
    "using very dense @xmath1-point meshes the bse hamiltonian matrices easily exceed 50  gb storage .",
    "since the storage requirements scale quadratically with the number of @xmath1 points , also the use of refined regular @xmath1-point meshes rapidly approaches the limits of today s supercomputers .    in order to reduce the memory demands , but also the computer time for setting up @xmath0 , one may benefit from noting that the wave functions of wannier - mott like excitons are well localized in @xmath1 space ( cf .",
    "[ fig : hyb_mesh ] ) . therefore , it is reasonable to refine the @xmath1 meshes only in the center of the bz @xcite .",
    "such a refinement , however , comes at the price of having to introduce varying weights ( see eqs .",
    "( [ equ : bse_ddef1])([equ : bse_gevp ] ) ) , turning into the generalized evp .",

    "secondly , an inner region , fenced in by @xmath1 points of the coarse mesh , is defined and the points inside this region including those on the borders are removed . in a third step , this inner region is filled with a fine - grained regular @xmath1 mesh , which must be constructed accordingly to include @xmath1 points on the borders of the inner region . finally , the latter @xmath1 points are centered inside their associated @xmath1-space volume . in some cases",
    "it is meaningful to further refine the @xmath1-point mesh in the inner region .",
    "this can be achieved by repeating steps two and three with respect to the inner mesh .",
    "hereafter , meshes constructed accordingly by double repetition of the latter steps are referred to as double - hybrid ones .",
    "the following notation is used to characterize the afore - described hybrid meshes ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : hyb_mesh ] and its caption ) .",
    "the first set of numbers indicates the @xmath1 points in the outer ( coarsely sampled ) part of the bz along the directions of the reciprocal basis .",
    "the second set indicates the size of the central part of the bz ( with refined sampling ) with respect to the @xmath1-point distance of the outer mesh , and the third set of numbers provides a measure for the sampling density inside the central part of the bz . for better comparison",
    "the latter set corresponds to the number of regular @xmath1 points in each direction necessary for sampling the whole bz at the density achieved by the refined sampling .",
    "double - hybrid meshes are characterized additionally by the size and sampling information of the second refinement region , encoded in the same manner as for the single hybrid meshes described before . to shorten the notation in case of isotropic sampling , only one number",
    "is given per set ( see also the caption of fig .  [",

    "this also involves @xmath90 points that are not part of the hybrid @xmath1-point mesh , which is no concern in case of a constant or model screening as used throughout this work .",
    "however , if the screening is calculated in random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , this constitutes an additional complication , that might be overcome by interpolating the screening for @xmath90 points not included in the hybrid mesh .",
