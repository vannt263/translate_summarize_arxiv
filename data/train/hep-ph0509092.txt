    "<S> we study two - body @xmath0 decays , assuming that each decay process go through the _ bare _ amplitude followed by elastic su(3 ) rescattering , where the _ bare _ amplitude consists of ( i ) the color - allowed and color - suppressed factorization amplitudes and ( ii ) the short - distance weak annihilation amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the @xmath1 fit on 14 branching ratios of @xmath2 decays in the formalism of the above mentioned model . </S>",
    "<S> the final state interactions can be well accounted for by the short - distance annihilation topologies and su(3 ) rescatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the two su(3 ) rescattering phase differences are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the rescattering phases of final states corresponding to the representations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath9 decay occurs mainly due to the nonzero short - distance weak annihilation effects , originating from su(3 ) symmetry - breaking corrections to the distribution amplitudes of the final - state kaons , but receives tiny effects from other modes via su(3 ) rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in remarkable accordance with the current data . </S>"
