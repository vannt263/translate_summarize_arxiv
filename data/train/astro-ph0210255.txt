    "simple estimators based on the virial theorem have long been used to ascertain the masses of galaxy groups from radial velocities and projected positions of the members ( e.g. zwicky 1933 ) .",
    "nowadays , they have been largely superceded by the projected mass estimator , which is based on averaging ( projected distance)@xmath0 ( radial velocity)@xmath1 over the sample ( bahcall & tremaine 1981 ; heisler , tremaine & bahcall 1985 ) . in the form in which it is usually encountered , a key assumption underlying the estimator is that the member galaxies track the mass of the group .",
    "the problem of estimating the masses of elliptical galaxies and the haloes of spiral galaxies is different . here , the datasets available are the radial velocities and projected positions of tracer populations , such as dwarf galaxy satellites , globular clusters , distant halo stars and planetary nebulae or pne ( see e.g. , wilkinson et al .",
    "2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "these do not follow the underlying mass distribution which is dominated by the dark matter . for nearby galaxies , the advent of wide - field imaging and efficient planetary nebulae spectrographs ( e.g. , mndez et al . 2001 ; halliday et al .",
    "2002 ) means that the quality and quantity of such datasets are destined to improve dramatically in the next few years .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new and simple mass estimator for galaxy haloes tailored for tracer populations and to apply them to new datasets for the andromeda ( m31 ) galaxy .",
    "it is the generalisation of the projected mass estimator to the commonest case of all  namely that when the number density of the tracer population is different from the overall mass density .",
    "on dimensional grounds , any mass estimator derived from projected data on a set of @xmath2 tracer objects involves weighted means of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the line of sight velocity ( relative to the mean or systemic velocity ) and @xmath5 the projected position of the @xmath6th object relative to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the projected mass estimator is @xmath7 this was introduced by bahcall & tremaine ( 1981 ) for test particles orbiting point masses ( such as stars around a black hole or distant companion galaxies orbiting a central massive galaxy ) .",
    "the constant @xmath8 for test particles with an isotropic velocity distribution orbiting a point mass , whereas @xmath9 for test particles moving on radial orbits .",
    "subsequently , heisler et al .",
    "( 1985 ) extended the projected mass estimator to the case in which the galaxy members are believed to track the total mass , such as galaxy groups .",
    "the constant @xmath9 for particles with an isotropic velocity distribution , whereas @xmath10 for particles moving on radial orbits .",
    "we wish to generalise the mass estimator ( [ eq : proj ] ) to the case when the objects are drawn from a tracer population ( such as globular clusters or pne ) between radii @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "let us assume that the tracer population is spherically symmetric and has a number density which falls off like a power - law @xmath13 within the region of interest .",
    "the underlying gravity field is assumed to be scale - free @xmath14 when @xmath15 , this corresponds to test particles orbiting a point - mass ; when @xmath16 , the satellites are moving in a large - scale mass distribution with a flat rotation curve ; when @xmath17 , the satellites follow the total self - gravitating mass ( the case studied by heisler et al .",
    "properties of such tracer populations in scale - free spherical potentials have been deduced by evans , hfner & de zeeuw ( 1997 ) .",
    "suppose our tracers are distributed over a range of projected radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( corresponding to the three - dimensional radii @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "what mass distribution do they probe ?",
    "by newton s theorem , there is no knowledge whatsoever on the mass distribution outside @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the best we can do is to estimate the total mass within the radius of the most distant satellite , namely @xmath20 from the dataset of positions and velocities",
    ". let ( @xmath21 ) be standard spherical polars with the @xmath22 axis defining the line of sight , so that the projected position @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "denoting the phase space distribution function of the tracer population by @xmath25 , then the average value of @xmath26 in the survey is @xmath27 here , we have computed the average over the ensemble between the radii @xmath11 and @xmath12 probed by our data . in this formula",

    "\\label{eq : masst}\\ ] ]      for the moment , let us assume that the velocity distribution of the tracers is isotropic so that the radial velocity dispersion @xmath31 is the same as the tangential @xmath32 . in this case ,",
    "evans et al . ( 1997 ) solve the jeans equations and derive the result @xmath33 for example ,",
    "if the potential is isothermal ( @xmath16 ) with a flat rotation curve of amplitude @xmath34 and the density of the population falls off like @xmath35 , then the velocity dispersion is just @xmath36  which is a well - known result from the last century ( e.g. , smart 1938 ) .",
    "now , substituting ( [ eq : masst ] ) and ( [ eq : dispersions ] ) into ( [ eq : earlyone ] ) , we obtain : @xmath37 in other words , suppose we gather positions and velocities for a population of globular clusters or pne with a three - dimensional number density falling like @xmath35 between an inner radius @xmath11 and an outer radius @xmath12 .",
    "the mass enclosed within the outermost datapoint is given by the simple formula @xmath38 with @xmath39 we refer to this as _ the tracer mass estimator_. at first sight , it seems that the constant @xmath40 in eq  ( [ eq : massnewconst ] ) is singular when the tracer population density falls off like @xmath41 ( that is , @xmath42 ) or when @xmath43 ( for example , if the tracer population density falls off like @xmath44 in an isothermal ( @xmath45 ) potential ) .",
    "however , a careful application of lhpital s rule shows that the constants are well - defined .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tab : constants ] for convenience .",
    "how do we set the parameters occurring in eq  ( [ eq : massnewconst ] ) ?",
    "it is always reasonable to assume that @xmath46 , where @xmath18 is the projected radius of the innermost datapoint . if the dataset is derived from a wide - angle survey , in which the population is traced out to large radii , then it is also reasonable to assume that @xmath47 , the projected radius of the outermost datapoint .",
    "but , this assumption is not appropriate for a dataset restricted to the inner parts only , because this will usually contain objects at larger three - dimensional radii projected into the sample .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 can be calculated from the surface density of the tracer population between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath49 ( and also possibly @xmath12 ) need to be set using astrophysical considerations .",
    "we are envisaging applications to the outer parts of galaxies probed by globular clusters and pne , and so it is reasonable to set @xmath50 as the potential is probably close to isothermal .",
    "for example , wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) studied the milky way galaxy and found that a near - isothermal potential is valid out to @xmath51 kpc .",
    "comparison of the result ( [ eq : massnew]-[eq : massnewconst ] ) with previous work is instructive .",
    "for example , when @xmath15 , the potential is keplerian and we find that @xmath52 when @xmath53 , the tracer population follows the underlying dark matter density and we find that @xmath54 } \\sum_i \\vlos^2_i r_i.\\ ] ] these are not quite the same as the results given by bahcall & tremaine ( 1981 ) and heisler et al .",
    "these investigators assumed that the sample was gathered from the center of the galaxy or cluster to infinity . in a number of integration by parts , boundary terms",
    "could therefore be legitimately dropped under the assumption @xmath55 as @xmath56 and as @xmath57 . in our calculation",
    ", we have always performed the averaging over a finite range of radii and the contribution from the boundaries does not generally vanish .",
    "this is the origin of the difference .",
    "even when we formally take the limit @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the boundary terms still do not vanish as the density distribution ( [ eq : cuspdens ] ) of the tracer population is cusped .",
    "of course , such a limit is purely formal , as our estimator is derived under the assumption that the power - law density distribution holds over a certain rgime only .",
    "cc case & constant +   + @xmath60 & @xmath61 +   + @xmath43 & @xmath62 +   +      now let us extend the calculation to deal with populations with anisotropic velocity distributions , although still retaining the assumption of spherical symmetry for the density distribution .",
    "binney s ( 1981 ) anisotropy parameter @xmath63 is often used to measure the relative importance of the radial @xmath31 and tangential @xmath32 velocity dispersions . when @xmath64 , this is the circular orbit model and when @xmath65 , this is the radial orbit model . for models in which the anisotropy @xmath66 does not vary with radius",
    ", the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath28 is related to the radial velocity dispersion by @xmath67 substituting into ( [ eq : earlyone ] ) , we find @xmath68 the radial velocity dispersion @xmath31 of the tracer population is ( evans et al . 1997 ) @xmath69 from this , we deduce @xmath70 with @xmath71 this is the extension of the result to populations with constant anisotropy . unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary ( e.g. , a highly flattened system supported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion ) , we advocate assuming isotropy .",
    "the value of eq  ( [ eq : anisoa ] ) is that it enables us to calculate the error in making such an approximation .",
    "for example , suppose we consider tracer populations with a number density falling like @xmath44 in an isothermal potential .",
    "the anisotropy of stellar populations is not usually more extreme than @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , eq  ( [ eq : anisoa ] ) tells us that mistakenly assuming isotropy leads to mass underestimates ( overestimates ) in the case of radial ( tangential ) anisotropy of @xmath73 .",

    "finally , a random projection direction is chosen and the line of sight velocity @xmath86 and projected position @xmath23 calculated .",

    "the sample size is again @xmath95 .",
    "the tracer mass estimator outperforms the projected and virial mass estimators in every case .",
    "this is as it should be , since the tracer mass estimator has been devised for the precise purpose of mass estimation from tracer populations , while the other two estimators have been devised with other applications in mind .",
    "it is interesting to ask how often the estimates are too low or too high by @xmath96 .",
    "this information is recorded in table  [ tab : percents ] for some of the simulations .",
    "the projected and virial mass estimators yield systematic underestimates if they are mistakenly applied to tracer populations .",
    "further , the situation is not improved by increasing the size of the tracer population ",
    "the estimators merely converge to an underestimated mass .",
    "finally , we test the tracer mass estimator against synthetic datasets drawn from a self - consistent plummer model with a core radius @xmath97 .",
    "this is a important thing to do as the tracer estimator has been derived for , and tested against , the scale - free case .",

    "the projected mass estimator performs well , as it should do .",
    "nonetheless , the tracer mass estimator ( with @xmath48 = 5 , @xmath49 = 1 and @xmath66 = 0 ) gives slightly better results .",
    "the reason why the tracer mass estimator still out - performs the projected mass estimator is that the former includes a correction for the limited radial coverage of the sample , whereas the latter does not .",
    "it is important to know the mass of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the density profiles of dark matter haloes are an important constraint on cosmological theories of galaxy formation ( e.g. , sellwood 2001 ) .",
    "the haloes of nearby galaxies are particularly important as they can be studied in much greater detail .",
    "second , the current generation of pixel lensing experiments towards m31 ( e.g. , aurire et al .",
    "2001 , paulin - henriksson et al .",
    "2002 ) requires an accurate estimate of the total mass so as to constrain the fraction in compact objects capable of producing microlensing events .",
    "we shall consider two datasets which probe andromeda s dark halo , namely the globular clusters and the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies .",
    "perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) give the positions , velocities and metallicities for over 200 globular clusters in m31 out to a projected distance @xmath102 kpc .",
    "the data were obtained using fiber optic spectroscopy on the _ william herschel telescope _ and the typical errors on the radial velocities are @xmath103 .",
    "when combined with earlier data from huchra , brodie & kent ( 1991 ) , this gives a grand total of @xmath104 globular clusters . from the bimodality of the metallicity distribution , perrett et al .",
    "show that the m31 globular clusters fall into metal - poor and metal - rich categories with different kinematics .",
    "as judged from the double gaussian fit to the metallicity distribution , there are 177 globular clusters with a probability of belonging to the halo of greater than @xmath105 .",
    "the cumulative number distribution of the halo globular clusters is shown in figure  [ fig : gc_n_vs_r ] . only beyond 30 arcmin",
    "does the projected number density of the halo globulars fall off like a power - law , namely @xmath106 .",
    "accordingly , we work with the 89 halo globular clusters with projected radii greater than 30 arcmin . the mean rotation amplitude of this sub - sample is @xmath107 . adopting a distance of 770 kpc ,",
    "the globular clusters lie in projection between 6.8 kpc and 33 kpc .",
    "however , the globular cluster population in m31 certainly extends out to @xmath108 kpc ( e.g. , hodge 1992 ) . using monte carlo simulations to build samples of 88 globular clusters with @xmath109 , we find that typically @xmath110 of the sample have @xmath111 with the outermost datapoints typically at @xmath112 kpc . accordingly , in the formula for the tracer mass estimator , we set @xmath113 ( isothermal - like galaxy ) , @xmath114 , @xmath115 kpc and @xmath116 kpc .",
    "the jeans equation for a population with constant anisotropy @xmath66 about a mean velocity @xmath117 is ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 , section 4.2 ) @xmath118\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side describes the contribution of rotation to @xmath119 , the second term the contribution of pressure . with obvious notation ,",
    "we write @xmath120\\ ] ] we compute @xmath121 directly from the mean rotation amplitude of the sample .",
    "we use the tracer mass estimator , applied to the observational data with the mean rotation velocity subtracted from the line of sight velocity , to compute @xmath122 assuming isotropy .",
    "hence , the total mass within @xmath108 kpc of the center of m31 is @xmath123 .",
    "note the tracer mass estimator applies to a pressure - supported tracer population and therefore any net rotation of the system must be subtracted before the velocities are used to estimate @xmath124 .    how does the result from the tracer mass estimator compare with earlier work ?",
    "evans & wilkinson ( 2000 ) give the results of more sophisticated modelling . here , the phase space distribution function of the globular cluster and the satellite galaxy population is built and then convolved with the errors to find the probability of the dataset given the model parameters .",
    "this is inverted using bayesian likelihood techniques to give the probability of the enclosed mass given the positions and velocities of the halo globular clusters . using the combined globular cluster and satellite galaxy sample",
    ", they reckoned that the most likely total mass of m31 is @xmath125 .",
    "an independent constraint on the mass of m31 within 30 kpc is given by the hi rotation curve .",
    "this was measured to distances of @xmath102 kpc along the major axis by newton & emerson ( 1977 ) .",
    "their estimate of the asymptotic circular speed is 230 . assuming the circular velocity curve maintains this amplitude out to 100 kpc , then the mass within 100 kpc is @xmath126 .",
    "we conclude that the results are all consistent and support a picture in which m31 s dark halo extends out in an isothermal - like manner to at least 100 kpc .",
    "there are 15 probable companion galaxies to m31 .",
    "their galactic coordinates , projected position from the center of m31 and line of velocity are listed in table  [ tab : satdata ] . the observed radial velocities contain contributions from the galactic rotation and from the relative velocity between the galaxy and m31 .",
    "assuming that the transverse velocity of m31 with respect to the galaxy is zero , we remove these contributions and list the corrected velocities in the frame of m31 in table  [ tab : satdata ] .",
    "the number density of m31 s satellite galaxies falls like @xmath127 ( see e.g. , evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "notice that the projected positions of many of the objects lies well beyond the rgime in which the m31 halo is expected to be isothermal .",
    "rather , the underlying gravitational potential is probably dominated by the monopole component at such huge distances .",
    "this suggests that it is appropriate to apply the tracer mass estimate with @xmath128 and @xmath129 to the satellite galaxy dataset .",
    "this gives the mass of m31 as @xmath130 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the more sophisticated modelling in evans et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who claimed that the total mass is @xmath131 from the same dataset .",
    "in fact , it is in excellent accord with still earlier work by bahcall & tremaine ( 1981 ) , who also found a mass of @xmath132 from just five companions ( m32 , m33 , ngc 147 , ngc 185 and ngc 205 ) . despite the seeming agreement ,",
    "the uncertainty in the mass is at least a factor of 3 .",
    "for example , if instead we choose @xmath133 ( suitable for a halo with a rotation curve slowly falling like @xmath134 ) , then the mass of m31 as deduced from the tracer estimator more than triples to @xmath135 .    an assumption underlying the tracer mass estimator ( as well as the projected and virial estimators )",
    "is that of a steady state equilibrium .",
    "this is reasonable enough for globular cluster and pne datasets , but probably not for satellite galaxies .",
    "the dsph and dirr companions of m31 may well be falling in for the first time , in which case the assumption of a steady state is probably not a valid description of the dynamics .",
    "it would be valuable to calibrate the importance of the effects of disequilibrium against high resolution n - body simulations of the local group .",
