    "clusters of galaxies are strong emitters of x - rays , which originate from a hot and diffuse intra - cluster medium ( icm ) . at the typical temperatures of a few @xmath2 k ,",
    "the bulk of the hot icm emission is detected at energies @xmath3 1 kev , intervening galactic absorption being responsible for a substantial reduction of flux below @xmath0 1 kev . however , hot gas is not the only high energy component seen in clusters , and the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray band below @xmath0 1 kev offer a unique window to investigate the presence of other phases in the icm .    in 1996 ,",
    "lieu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported the discovery of excess euv and soft x - ray emission above the contribution from the hot icm in the coma cluster ; their conclusions were based upon _",
    "extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) _ deep survey data ( 65 - 200 ev ) and _ rosat _ pspc data ( 0.15 - 0.3 kev ) .",
    "subsequently , bowyer , berghoefer and korpela ( 1999 ) reanalyzed the euve data and confirmed the existence of strong excess emission in the central 15 of coma .",
    "arabadjis and bregman ( 1999 ) reanalyzed the pspc data , and reported that the fitted hi column density in the center of the cluster was significantly smaller than the measured galactic value , consistent with the earlier reports of soft x - ray excess emission .",
    "recently , the spatial distribution of the soft x - ray emission in the center of the coma cluster was investigated by bonamente et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and nevalainen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of a mosaic of _ rosat _ pspc observations around the coma cluster , revealing a very diffuse soft x - ray halo extending to considerably larger distances than reported in the previous studies .",
    "the nature of the excess emission has been under active scrutiny .",
    "the emission could originate from inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons against a population of relativistic electrons in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , as advocated by hwang ( 1997 ) , sarazin and lieu ( 1998 ) , ensslin and biermann ( 1998 ) and lieu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . alternatively",
    ", warm gas at t@xmath4 k could be responsible for the soft emission ( lieu et al .",
    "1996 , nevalainen et al .",
    "warm gas may reside inside the cluster , or in very diffuse filamentary structures outside the cluster projecting onto it , as seen in large scale hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , cen and ostriker 1999 , dav et al .",
    "2001 , cen et al 2001 ) .",
    "the warm gas scenario appears to be favored by the current x - ray spectral analyses ( e.g. , bonamente et al .",
    "2001a , buote 2001 ) , although a search for the uv ovi emission lines ( 1032 - 1039   in rest frame ) has not yielded positive results ( dixon , hurwitz and ferguson 1996 ; dixon et al .",
    "the non - detection of emission lines can be reconciled with the soft excess detection if the gas has very low metal abundances , or alternatively if the gas exists in a temperature range where ovi is not the predominant oxygen ion .",
    "the spectral analysis of pspc data reported in this paper indicates that the emission is very likely thermal in nature .",
    "the pspc observations are described in section 2 , and the distribution of the galactic hi over the field of view is presented in section 3 .",
    "analysis of the pspc spectra is given in section 4 , followed by the interpretation in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the redshift to the coma cluster is @xmath5=0.023 ( struble and rood 1999 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( freedman et al . 2001 ) , and all quoted uncertainties are at the 68% confidence level .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc instrument has unique capabilities for the study of the low energy excess emission in clusters of galaxies . along with an effective area of @xmath8 @xmath9 at 0.25 kev , the spectral response between 0.2 and 2 kev",
    "is well calibrated ( snowden et al . 1994 ) . moreover ,",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath10 degree radius ) , low detector background and the availability of a large number of deep cluster observations and of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey data ( rass ) , render the pspc a unique instrument to detect and investigate the large - scale diffuse emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "coma is the nearest rich galaxy cluster , and the x - ray emission from its hot icm reaches an angular radius of at least 1 degree ( e.g. , white et al . 1993 , briel et al .",
    "if the soft x - ray background level is estimated from the edge of the pspc field of view as is customarily done for more distant clusters , the background can be significantly overestimated due to the extended cluster emission ( bonamente et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "we show how several off - center pspc observations provide a reliable measurement of the background and reveal a very extended halo of soft x - ray excess radiation , covering a region several megaparsecs in extent in the coma cluster .",
    "the rass maps of the diffuse x - ray background ( snowden et al .",
    "1997 ) are suitable to measure the extent of the soft x - ray emission ( r2 band , @xmath0 0.15 - 0.3 kev ) around the coma cluster and to compare it with that of the higher - energy x - ray emission ( r7 band , @xmath0 1 - 2 kev ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show a radial profile of the surface brightness of pspc bands r2 and r7 centered on coma : the higher - energy emission has reached a constant background value at a radius of @xmath0 1.5 degrees , while the soft x - ray emission persists out to a radius of @xmath0 3 degrees .",
    "thus , the rass data indicate that the soft emission is more extended than the 1 - 2 kev emission , which originates primarily from the hot phase of the icm .",
    "the all - sky survey data is based on very short exposures ( @xmath0 700 sec ) ; therefore , for detailed studies of the soft x - ray emission in the coma cluster , we use the four pspc observations shown in fig . 2 .",
    "four additional deep pspc observations ( also shown in fig .",
    "2 ) are used to determine the local background  .",
    "we show in section 3 below that the distribution of @xmath11 is essentially constant within 5 degrees of the cluster center .",
    "therefore , the off - source pspc fields located 2.5 - 4 degrees away from the cluster center provide an accurate measurement of the soft x - ray background , and are also far enough away from the cluster center to avoid being contaminated by cluster x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "knowledge of the galactic absorption is essential to determine the intrinsic x - ray emission from extragalactic objects , particularly at energies @xmath12 1 kev . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the absorption cross sections of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) in our models .",
    "these cross sections are in good agreement with the recent compilation of yan , sadeghpour and dalgarno ( 1998 ) , as discussed by arabadjis and bregman ( 1999 ) . at the resolution of the pspc ,",
    "the he cross section in the most recent compilation by wilms , allen and mccray ( 2000 ) is also indistinguishable from the values of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) , as discussed by bonamente et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "we use two methods to determine the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the coma cluster .",
    "first , we use the radio measurements of dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) and of hartmann and burton ( 1997 ) , which are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . the radio measurements are in excellent agreement , and show the measured hi column density varying smoothly from 9 @xmath13 @xmath9 to 11 @xmath13 @xmath9 within a radius of 5 degrees from the center of the coma cluster .",
    "second , we employ the far - infrared iras data , and use the correlation between 100 @xmath14 m iras flux and hi column density ( boulanger and perault 1988 ) .",
    "the slope of the correlation is @xmath15 @xmath9 / ( mjy sr@xmath7 ) , and the offset is determined by fixing the central @xmath11 value to 9 @xmath13 @xmath9 , which is well established from independent radio measurements of the center of the coma cluster ( dickey and lockman 1990 , lieu et al .",
    "1996 , hartmann and burton 1997 ) .",
    "3 shows that the radial variation of @xmath11 inferred from the iras data is in extremely good agreement with the radio measurements .",
    "the data indicate that + ( a ) the hi column density within the central 1.5 degree of the cluster is constant ( 9@xmath161 @xmath13 @xmath9 ) , and + ( b ) in the region where the off - source background fields are located ( 2.5 - 4 degrees from the cluster center ) , the hi column density is between 9 @xmath13 @xmath9 and 11 @xmath13 @xmath9 .",
    "an @xmath11 variation of this magnitude has a negligible effect on the soft x - ray flux in the pspc r2 band ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 in snowden et al .",
    "1998 ) .    with the present ir and radio data we can not address the possibility of variations in the hi distribution on scales smaller that @xmath0 10 arcmin . on occasions for which a comparison with stellar ly@xmath17 and qso x - ray spectra could be made ,",
    "the @xmath11 was found consistent with the wide - beam measurements to within @xmath18 @xmath9 ( laor et al .",
    "1994 ; elvis , lockman and wilkes 1989 ; dickey and lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the 4 pspc coma observations were divided into concentric annuli centered at r.a.=12h5948 `` , dec.=25@xmath19570 '' ( j2000 ) , and the spectra were coadded to reduce the statistical errors .",
    "the pointed pspc data were reduced according to the prescriptions of snowden et al .",
    "the datasets were corrected for detector gain fluctuations , and only events with average master veto rate @xmath12 170 c / s were considered , in order to discard periods of high particle background .",
    "the pspc rejection efficiency for particle background is 99.9 % in the 0.2 - 2 kev energy range ( plucinsky et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the background is therefore solely represented by the photonic component . for each of the 4 off - source fields in fig .",
    "1 , a spectrum was extracted after removal of point sources .",
    "the spectra were statistically consistent with one another within at most @xmath0 10 % point - to - point fluctuations .",
    "the off - source spectra were therefore coadded , and a 10% systematic uncertainty in the background was included in the error analysis .",
    "further details of the pspc data analysis can be found in bonamente et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "initially , we fit the spectrum of each annulus in xspec , using a single - temperature mekal plasma model ( mewe , gronenschild and van den oord 1985 ; mewe , lemen and van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ) and the wabs galactic absorption model ( morrison and mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "the results of the single temperature fit are given in table 1 , and are shown for one of the annuli in fig .",
    "4 . if the neutral hydrogen column density is fixed at the galactic value ( 9 @xmath13 @xmath9 , see section 3 ) , the fits are statistically unacceptable ( reduced @xmath20 ranging from 3.1 to 9.7 ) . allowing the neutral hydrogen column density to vary results in an unrealistically low @xmath11 for all of the annuli , and also produces statistically unacceptable fits ( reduced @xmath20 ranging from 2.5 to 4.2 ) .",
    "we conclude that a single temperature plasma model does not adequately describe the spectral data , particularly at energies below 1 kev ( fig .",
    "4 ) . therefore ,",
    "in the analysis that follows , we fit only the high energy portion of the spectrum ( 1 - 2 kev ) with a single temperature plasma model , and introduce an additional model component to account for the low energy emission .",
    "to fit the high energy portion of the spectrum , we apply a mekal model to the data between 1 and 2 kev , and a photoelectric absorption model with @xmath21 @xmath9 .",
    "the metal abundance is fixed at 0.25 solar for the central 20 arcmin region ( arnaud et al .",
    "2001 ) , and at 0.2 solar in the outer regions .",
    "the spectra are also subdivided into quadrants , in order to obtain a more accurate temperature for each region of the cluster .",
    "the results of the ` hot icm ' fit are given in table 2 , and are consistent with the results previously derived from the pspc data by briel and henry ( 1997 ) , and with recent xmm measurements ( arnaud et al .",
    "in addition , the temperature found at large radii is in agreement with the composite cluster temperature profile of de grandi and molendi ( 2002 ) .",
    "the measured fluxes in the soft x - ray band can now be compared with the hot icm model predictions in the 0.2 - 1 kev band .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 and fig .",
    "the error bars reflect the uncertainty in the hot icm temperature ( table 2 ) and the uncertainty in the galactic hi column density ( @xmath22 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the soft excess component is detected with high statistical significance throughout the 90 radius of the pointed pspc data , which corresponds to a radial distance of 2.6 mpc . the soft excess emission ( fig .",
    "5 , left panel ) is much more extended than that of the hot icm ( fig . 5 , right panel )",
    ", in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the all - sky survey data ( fig .",
    "1 ) .      having established the hot icm temperature for each quadrant ( table 2 ) , we now consider additional components in the spectral analysis .",
    "first , we add a power law non - thermal component , which predominantly contributes to the low energy region of the spectrum ( sarazin and lieu 1998 ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density was fixed at the galactic value ( @xmath21 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the results of fitting the hot icm plus power law models to the annular regions are shown in table 3 .",
    "the reduced @xmath20 values are poor : the average @xmath23 is 1.48 , and the worst case value is 1.89 ; we conclude that the combination of a low energy power law component and the hot icm thermal model does not adequately describe the pspc spectral data .",
    "finally , we consider a model consisting of a ` hot icm ' thermal component ( section 4.2 ) and an additional low - temperature thermal component .",
    "as before , the neutral hydrogen column density was fixed at the galactic value ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the results of fitting the hot icm plus warm thermal models are shown in table 3 .",
    "the reduced @xmath20 values are significantly improved relative to the previous case : the average reduced @xmath20 is 1.24 and the worst case value is 1.45 . in every region",
    "the fit obtained with a warm thermal component was superior to the fit using a non - thermal component , as indicated by inspection of the @xmath23 values and by an f - test ( bevington 1969 ) on the two @xmath20 distributions ( table 3 ) .",
    "the spectral analysis of section 4 indicates that the excess emission can be explained as thermal radiation from diffuse warm gas .",
    "the non - thermal model appears viable only in a few quadrants , and will not be further considered in this paper .",
    "if the soft excess emission originates from a warm phase of the intra - cluster medium , the ratio of the emission integral of the hot icm ( table 2 ) and the emission integral of the warm gas ( table 3 ) can be used to measure the relative mass of the two phases .",
    "the emission integral is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gas density and @xmath26 is the volume of emitting region ( sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the emission integral is readily measured by fitting the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the emission integral of each quadrant determines the average density of the gas in that region , once the volume of the emitting region is specified ( eq .",
    "1 ) . assuming that each quadrant corresponds to a sector of a spherical shell , the density in each sector can be calculated .",
    "the density of the warm gas ranges from @xmath0 9@xmath27 @xmath28 to @xmath29 @xmath28 , and the density of the hot gas varies from @xmath30 @xmath28 to @xmath31 @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that both the warm gas and the hot gas are distributed in spherical shells of constant density .",
    "since the emission integral is proportional to @xmath32 and the mass is proportional to @xmath33 , the ratio of the warm - to - hot gas mass is @xmath34 we evaluate eq . 2 by summing the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for all regions ( tables 2 and 3 ) , and",
    "conclude that @xmath37=0.75 within a radius of 2.6 mpc .",
    "it is also possible that the warm gas is distributed in extended low - density filaments rather then being concentrated near the cluster center like the hot icm .",
    "recent large - scale hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "2001 , dav et al .",
    "2001 , cen and ostriker 1999 ) indicate that this is the case , and that 30 - 40 % of the present epoch s baryons reside in these filamentary structures .",
    "typical filaments feature a temperature of t@xmath38 k , consistent with our results in table 3 , and density of @xmath39 @xmath28 ( overdensity of @xmath40 , cen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the ratio of mass in warm filaments to mass in the hot icm is @xmath41    assuming a filament density of @xmath42 @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) yields the conclusion that @xmath43= 3 within a radius of 2.6 mpc ; the ratio will be even larger if the filaments are less dense .",
    "the warm gas is therefore more massive than the hot icm if it is distributed in low - density filaments .",
    "more detailed mass estimates require precise knowledge of the filaments spatial distribution .",
    "the analysis of deep pspc data of the coma cluster reveals a large - scale halo of soft excess radiation , considerably more extended than previously thought .",
    "the pspc data indicate that the excess emission is due to warm gas at t@xmath4 k , which may exist either as a second phase of the intra - cluster medium , or in diffuse filaments outside the cluster .",
    "evidence in favor of the latter scenario is provided by the fact that the spatial extent of the soft excess emission is significantly greater than that of the hot icm .",
    "the total mass of the coma cluster within 14 mpc is 1.6@xmath44 ( geller , diaferio and kurtz ) .",
    "the mass of the hot icm is @xmath45 within 2.6 mpc ( mohr , mathiesen and evrard 1999 ) .",
    "the present detection of soft excess emission out to a distance of 2.6 mpc from the cluster s center implies that the warm gas has a mass of at least @xmath46 , or considerably larger if the gas is in very low density filaments .",
    "the pspc data presented in this paper therefore lends observational support to the current theories of large - scale formation and evolution ( e.g , cen and ostriker 1999 ) , which predict that a large fraction of the current epoch s baryons are in a diffuse warm phase of the intergalactic medium .",

    "<S> several deep pspc observations of the coma cluster reveal a very large - scale halo of soft x - ray emission , substantially in excess of the well known radiation from the hot intra - cluster medium . </S>",
    "<S> the excess emission , previously reported in the central region of the cluster using lower - sensitivity euve and rosat data , is now evident out to a radius of 2.6 mpc , demonstrating that the soft excess radiation from clusters is a phenomenon of cosmological significance . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum at these large radii can not be modeled non - thermally , but is consistent with the original scenario of thermal emission from warm gas at @xmath0 @xmath1 k. the mass of the warm gas is on par with that of the hot x - ray emitting plasma , and significantly more massive if the warm gas resides in low - density filamentary structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus the data lend vital support to current theories of cosmic evolution , which predict that at low redshift @xmath0 30 - 40 % of the baryons reside in warm filaments converging at clusters of galaxies . </S>"
