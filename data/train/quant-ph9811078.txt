    "this gives raise to partial or total correlation between the outcomes of measurements performed on the two parts , even though the parts may be so far apart that no effects resulting from one measurement can reach the other part within the light cone .",
    "sources of entangled states are required for fundamentals tests of quantum mechanics , as well as for applications such as quantum computation and communication @xcite , and teleportation @xcite . in recent years ,",

    "recently , it has been demonstrated that a beam splitter can split an incident photon into two correlated secondary photons @xcite",
    ". however , such process occurs at very low rate , and thus it is of no interest in practical applications .    in order to study quantum correlations between two radiation modes , and to compare different sources of correlated states , one needs to quantify the degree of entanglement @xcite .",
    "a good theoretical measure of correlations has been introduced by means of von - neumann entropy .",

    "these effects occur when coincident photons are mixed at a beam splitter @xcite .",
    "the probability amplitudes for pairs from the two arms show destructive interference , leading to a suppression of the coincidence counting rate between detectors surveying the two arms @xcite .",
    "recently , the spatial effects in two - beam interference have been also studied for partially entangled photon pairs @xcite . in the case of more excited states ,",
    "many photons are present and the connection between entanglement and coincidence rate is less transparent .",
    "the issue has been received attention @xcite , though a general theory has not been developed yet .    in this paper",
    "we study the generation and the detection of entangled states at the output of a mach - zehnder interferometer fed by a couple of uncorrelated squeezed - coherent states .",
    "the scheme may be of interest as the output state can be arbitrarily high excited , instead of having two photons only .",
    "in addition , the degree of entanglement can be tuned by varying the degree of squeezing of the input beams , or the internal phase shift of the interferometer . as regards the detection scheme ,",
    "we show that the coincidence counting rate between the two output arms corresponds to low fringes visibility . therefore , we consider instead another intensity dependent quantity , namely the squared difference photocurrent , which shows high visibility of fringes for the whole range of input squeezing parameter .",
    "in section [ s : ent ] we study the dynamics of the interferometer , and evaluate analytically the degree of entanglement at the output as a function of the squeezing fraction of the input beams and the internal phase - shift of the interferometer . in section [",
    "s : vis ] we analyze the interference effects occurring in the measurement of the photon coincidence rate and of the squared difference photocurrent .",

    "the extreme case in which one of the input signals is no squeezed at all corresponds to a value of @xmath11 always lower than @xmath92 .",

    "however , as we will show in the following , this corresponds to low fringes visibility , and thus we sought for a more sensitive kind of measurement .",
    "the homodyne - like detection of the output difference photocurrent @xmath94 is widely used in interferometry @xcite , and generally results in a very sensitive measurement scheme . starting from this consideration , we suggest the squared difference photocurrent @xmath95 as a suitable fourth - order quantity to be measured at the output of the interferometer .    besides being originated by interference effects , the variations in the quantities measured at the output also reflect the variations in the quantum correlations between the two output signals .",
