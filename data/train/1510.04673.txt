    "the existence of dark energy ( de ) was postulated by two independent research groups in 1998 ( high - z supernova search team and supernova cosmology project ) to explain the regime of accelerated expansion of the current universe and became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics ; as a matter of fact , its origin from the fundamental point of view is still unknown @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been supported also by the observed anisotropies in the cmb spectrum @xcite and the analysis of the large scale structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "many phenomenological and theoretical models have been considered in the last years to resolve the dark energy problem @xcite .",
    "the natural candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xcite , conventionally associated with the energy of the vacuum with constant energy density and pressure , and an equation of state @xmath10 .",
    "other proposals incorporate dynamical models of de with scalar fields , which include quintessence , k - essence , tachyon , phantom , ghost condensates and dilaton @xcite .",
    "an alternative to dark energy is related to modified theories of gravity , @xmath11 @xcite , or in its more general form @xmath12 @xcite , in which dark energy emerges from the modification of geometry .",
    "besides of scalar fields models of de , in recent years some authors have considered another alternative about the nature of dark energy , suggesting the possibility that it could be described by a vector field @xcite . in this sense , we propose a vector - tensor model of dark energy with a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term coupled to vector field and without explicit potential terms . with this proposal ,",
    "we analyse a possible accelerated expansion phase of the universe in late times .",
    "in general , the gb term in four dimensions is known as a topological term , so the field equations are not influenced by it . however ,",
    "when one considers the gb term coupled to the matter field , the field equations are modified .",
    "further , the gb invariant has an important role in models with extra dimensions ( see ref .   and references therein ) and string theory . in string theory , the gb term arises when the tree - level effective action of the heterotic string is analysed @xcite . the gb term has been used for several authors in the context of inflation and dark energy models .",
    "a model with vector field coupled to gb invariant in a type bianchi i universe was proposed in ref .  .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "the authors have considered an inflation model with a cosmological vector field non - minimally coupled to gravity through the gb invariant . in the literature ,",
    "usually the gb invariant has been used in models with scalar fields @xcite , and in these papers it is shown that the gb coupling term may be relevant for the explanation of accelerated expansion of the universe at late times .",
    "this paper it is organized as follows : in section [ sec_model ] we introduce the vector - tensor model with a gb term coupled to the vector field and the corresponding field equations are obtained . in section [ sec_cosmoevol ] , we consider a flat frw type universe and a vector field without spatial components , and from these considerations we analyse the cosmological evolution of this model .",
    "section [ sec_fit ] is devoted to a statistical analysis of the model , by performing a fit of the single model parameter @xmath5 , to the observational data for @xmath4 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are exposed in section [ sec_concs ] .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) ; also , the authors of ref . considered a modified gauss - bonnet gravity model ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 in eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , in which inflation and late - time acceleration of the universe is realised .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath26 gives the field equations @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy momentum tensor for the vector field and has the following form : @xmath29 each term is given by the following expressions ( eqs .",

    "see @xcite .    on the other hand , the variation of the action with respect to @xmath36 , gives the equation of motion @xmath37",
    "to analyse the cosmological evolution of the universe generated by the previous model and determine if it is possible to obtain a regime of accelerated expansion of the universe at late times , we regard the flat robertson - walker metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the scale factor .",

    "( [ eq8a ] ) , it is easy to see that another possible choice is @xmath63 . in this case , @xmath64 , so that if @xmath65 one gets @xmath45 . with these values for the coupling constants , the first term in eq .",

    "we can see in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that it is possible to obtain a regime of accelerated expansion of the universe at late times for a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath5 ( up to a @xmath7 cl ) , since the equation state parameter satisfy the restriction @xmath1 .",

    "a simple but robust procedure to study models containing free parameters , is to perform a least - squares analysis ( see section 38 of ref .  ) , comparing theoretical predictions from the model for a specific measurable quantity , with experimental or observational data . in this case",
    ", one can carry out such an analysis using the observational data of @xmath4 and the obtained result for the hubble parameter given by eq .",

    "notice that our analysis excludes the case for which the gb term is not coupled to the vector field , @xmath22 , at more than @xmath7 c.l .",
    "also , despite of the apparent narrowness of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_chi2 ] ( note its log - scale of the horizontal axis ) , we obtained wide ranges for the values of the free parameter . in order to get even stronger constraints",
    ", one would need to have observational information with smaller uncertainties , or to use data of some other observables .",
    "for instance , one could use observational bounds on @xmath103 , as this parameter also appears explicitly in the theoretical prediction for @xmath4 , equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "otherwise , ppn solar system constraints could be implemented .    in order to have a taste of the goodness of our fit",
    ", we compare the model prediction for @xmath4 using the best fit value obtained for the free parameter , @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_bf ] ) , with the data points from @xcite .",

    "[ fig_fit ] clearly shows that data points ( plus uncertainties ) are very well covered by the @xmath105 and even the @xmath102 bands , demonstrating that our model exhibits a good fit to the data .",
    "once again , stronger bounds on observational data would certainly allow one to strengthen also the limits on the model .    finally ,",
    "as anticipated above , we have also performed the same kind of analysis for the other possible values of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq8a ] ) , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath65 .",

    "the gb invariant coupled to the scalar fields has been widely used in the literature and it is shown that the gb coupling term may be relevant for the explanation of accelerated expansion of the universe at late times ; it has also been considered in inflationary scenarios . furthermore , the gb invariant has an important role in models with extra dimensions ( braneworlds ) and in string theory .    in this paper",

    "and we found that the square of the speed of sound is negative for all values of redshift ; under this criterion , the model presented here shows a sign of instability under small perturbations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this behavior does not depend of the initial condition @xmath82 .",

    "<S> in this work we study a general vector - tensor model of dark energy with a gauss - bonnet term coupled to a vector field and without explicit potential terms . considering a spatially flat frw type universe and a vector field without spatial components , </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological evolution is analysed from the field equations of this model , considering two sets of parameters . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that it is possible to obtain an accelerated expansion phase of the universe , since the equation state parameter @xmath0 satisfies the restriction @xmath1 ( for suitable values of model parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , analytical expressions for the hubble parameter @xmath2 , equation state parameter @xmath0 and the invariant scalar @xmath3 are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the square of the speed of sound is negative for all values of redshift , therefore , the model presented here shows a sign of instability under small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we finally perform an analysis using @xmath4 observational data and we find that for the free parameter @xmath5 in the interval @xmath6 , at @xmath7 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( and fixing @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , the model has a good fit to the data . </S>"
