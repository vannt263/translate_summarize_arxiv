    "there exist many interesting systems in high energy physics whose action contains an imaginary part , such as qcd at finite baryon density , chern - simons theories , systems with topological terms ( like the @xmath0-term in qcd ) and systems with chiral fermions .",
    "this imposes a severe technical problem in the simulations , requiring an exponentially large amount of data for statistically significant measurements as the system size is increased or the critical point is approached .",
    "furthermore , the overlap problem appears when standard reweighting techniques are applied in such systems and it becomes exponentially hard with system size to visit the relevant part of the configuration space . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to take advantage of a factorization property of the distribution functions of the observables one is interested to measure .",
    "this approach can in principle be applied to _ any _ system and it eliminates the overlap problem completely .",
    "in some cases it is possible to use finite size scaling to extrapolate successfully to large system sizes where it would have been impossible to measure oscillating factors directly . the method has been applied successfully in matrix models of non perturbative string theory ( ikkt ) @xcite , random matrix theory of finite density qcd ( rmt ) @xcite as well as the 2d @xmath1 model , the 1d antiferromagnetic model with imaginary @xmath2 and the 2d compact u(1 ) with topological charge @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present our results @xcite for ikkt and rmt . in the first case we study the space ",
    "time dimensionality hoping to _ dynamically _ recover our 4d space  time and in the second to test the factorization method against known analytical results . in all cases",
    "we will be dealing with a system defined by a partition function @xmath3 and the corresponding phase quenched model @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the action of the system with its real and imaginary parts .",
    "@xmath6 represents collectively the degrees of freedom of the model and in our case it corresponds to a set of @xmath7 matrices . in case",
    "we are interested in measuring some observable @xmath8 , we consider the distribution functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 refers to @xmath12 .",
    "then we define the fiducial system @xmath13 , the weight factor @xmath14 and the distribution @xmath15 factorizes @xmath16 where @xmath17",
    ". then @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19function constraint is implemented in our simulations by considering the system @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are parameters which control the constraining of the simulation .",
    "the results are insensitive to the choice of @xmath23 as long as it is large enough .",
    "then we have that @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath25 in @xmath26 has a peak @xmath27 and the quantity @xmath28 is the value of @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 can be obtained by integrating an analytic function to which we fit the @xmath32 data points .    by applying this method",
    "we force the system to sample configurations which give the essential contributions to @xmath33 , something that would be increasingly difficult with system size in the phase quenched model , eliminating this way the overlap problem .",
    "this already allows us get close to the thermodynamic limit with modest computer resources .",
    "furthermore we obtain direct knowledge of @xmath34 and @xmath15 which allows us to understand the effect of @xmath35 .",
    "this is important for understanding the properties of the system when @xmath35 plays a crucial role . using the generic scaling properties of the weight factor @xmath36",
    ", one may extrapolate the results obtained by direct monte carlo evaluations to larger system size .",
    "such an extrapolation is expected to be particularly useful in cases where the distribution function turns out to be positive definite . in those cases we can",
    "actually even _ avoid _ using the reweighting formula by reducing the question of obtaining the expectation value to that of finding the minimum of the free energy , which is ( minus ) the _ log _ of the distribution function . here",
    ", the error in obtaining the scaling function propagates to the final result without significant magnifications .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation can be a powerful tool to probe the thermodynamic limit from the accessible system size .",
    "the so  called ikkt matrix model @xcite has been conjectured to be a definition for non  perturbative string theory .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of the model is that the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices @xmath37 generate space - time _",
    "dynamically_. in our case we work with a reduced model where @xmath38 .",
    "the observables that we study are the normalized eigenvalues @xmath39 of the space  time `` moment of inertia '' @xmath40 .",
    "an interesting scenario to investigate would be that the o(6 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken with some of the eigenvalues ( possibly 4 ) grow large and the rest remain small , providing a mechanism for dynamical compactification of extra dimensions .",

    "the ikkt model is a good example where finite size scaling for the oscillating factor @xmath36 works well ( the index @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 ) . for @xmath44",
    "we find fast convergence to a scaling function @xmath45 , where @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath45 for small matrix size @xmath47 and the phase quenched distribution function @xmath48 for larger size @xmath49 .",
    "then the factorization formula can be used in order to compute @xmath50 . note that in the computation of @xmath51 the errors do not propagate exponentially with system size since @xmath51 can be determined from the minimum of the `` free energy '' @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "1 we show our results for @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a double peak structure of @xmath53 is evident and it is expected that the peak for small @xmath56 will increase with system size @xcite .",
    "one hopes that this peak will be dominant for @xmath57 and that the large @xmath56 peak will be dominant for @xmath58 and this will realize the ssb scenario .",
    "note the heavy suppression of the @xmath59 region caused by @xmath35 which is the peak of the phase quenched model distribution of @xmath60 .",

    "we consider rmt with one quark flavour and zero quark mass @xcite .",
    "the model is chosen in order to study the correctness and effectiveness of the factorization method , since one can compare results with known analytical solutions even for finite @xmath49 .",
    "the observable we measure is the `` quark number density '' @xmath64 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath65 , and we consider the distribution functions @xmath50 , where @xmath66 corresponds to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath64 respectively . notice that the effect of @xmath35 is dramatic , causing a discontinuous transition in @xmath64 . in @xcite",
    "our results nicely reproduce the exact results known for finite @xmath49 and we are able to achieve large enough values of @xmath67 to obtain the thermodynamic limit . unfortunately , the function @xmath68 is not positive definite and the important contributions come from the region where it changes sign .",
    "as expected , we find that finite size scaling does not work as well as in the case of the ikkt model ( although we obtain agreement up to order of magnitude for the values of @xmath69 that we explored ) .",
    "we also find it very difficult to explore the crossover region near the phase transition point @xmath70 for @xmath71 since @xmath72 becomes very small .",
    "since rmt is a schematic model of finite density qcd , we expect that the factorization method will be useful to explore the phase diagram of qcd",
