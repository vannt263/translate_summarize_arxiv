    "during the last decade , it was shown that quantum mechanical systems have the potential for processing information more efficiently than classical systems @xcite .",
    "however , it remains difficult to realize this potential because quantum systems are extremely sensitive to perturbations .",
    "these perturbations come from external degrees of freedom or from the finite precision with which the systems can be realized and controlled by external fields .",
    "this loss of quantum information to the environment is called decoherence @xcite .",
    "different results show that a state is more sensitive to decoherence as the number of qubits increases @xcite .",
    "this is also manifested by the impossibility to time reverse a quantum evolution when an initially localized excitation spreads over a system @xcite .",
    "as the information is distributed over a increasing number of qubits , the evolution becomes more sensitive to the perturbation @xcite . in a similar vein",
    ", this sensitivity with the systems size limits the distance over which one can transfer information or analogously limits the number of qubits that one can control reliably @xcite .",
    "this is manifested as a localization effect for the quantum information @xcite . in order to overcome these limitations for allowing quantum information processing with large number of qubits , methods for reducing",
    "the decoherence effects have to be developed .",
    "one can tackle the problem by correcting the errors generated by the perturbations , but this is only possible if the perturbation is small enough to keep the quantumness of the system @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs first to reduce the perturbation effects .",
    "the pioneering strategies for reducing decoherence were introduced in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) community , in particular by erwin hahn who showed that inverting a spin-1/2 system ( a qubit ) corresponds to an effective change of the sign of the perturbation hamiltonian and therefore generates a time reversal of the corresponding evolution @xcite .",
    "this leads to the formation of an echo that later was formalized as a loschmidt echo @xcite .",
    "these manipulations were extended to the so - called decoupling methods @xcite , which disconnect effectively the environment .    in the context of this review , we describe the environment as a spin - bath , without loss of generality . considering spins 1/2 as qubits , two different types of decoupling methods can be distinguished . in the first case ,",
    "the qubit system is well distinguished from the environment .",
    "its energy level splitting differs significantly from that of the bath . as a result",
    ", the coupling between them is much smaller than the difference of their energy level splittings .",
    "the interaction can then always be approximated by an ising - type ( @xmath0 ) interaction , which causes dephasing of the system qubit but no qubit flips .",
    "the decoupling methods required for these cases are called heteronuclear decoupling within the nmr community and they can involve manipulation only on the spin - system @xcite or only at the environment @xcite .",
    "in the second case , the system and the environment have similar energy level splittings .",
    "this is the case of a homonuclear system where the general form of the coupling must be retained and it can induce flips of the system qubit as well as dephasing . in this case , decoupling will generally affect the complete system plus `` bath '' @xcite .",
    "in this review we focus on decoupling the system from the environment by applying control pulses only to the system . during the last years",
    "this technique has gathered a lot of interest because it requires relatively modest resources : it requires no overhead of information encoding , measurements or feedback .",
    "the method is known as dynamical decoupling ( dd ) . since its initial introduction @xcite ,",
    "a lot of effort has been invested to find sequences with improved error suppression @xcite .",
    "the optimal design of dd sequences depends of the different sources of errors that have to be eliminated .",
    "the first to be considered is the nature of the se interaction , i.e. , a pure dephasing when only the @xmath1-spin operator @xmath2 is present , a pure spin - flip interaction ( @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 are present ) or a general interaction with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "sequences like carr - purcell ( cp ) and carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) , which use rotations around a single axis , are useful when only two operators of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 are present , but in order to fight against a general interaction , pulses along different spatial direction have to be applied . the shortest sequence that fulfills this condition is the xy-4 sequence @xcite .",
    "an actual implementation must take into account , in addition to the above issues , the effect of pulse imperfections @xcite .",
    "fighting the effect of pulse errors was in fact the original motivation for the development of the xy-4 sequence @xcite .",
    "another experimental consideration is the amount of power deposited in the system , which often must be kept small to avoid heating effect or damage to the sample .",
    "dd technique is becoming an important tool for quantum information processing @xcite as well as in spectroscopy @xcite and imaging @xcite .",
    "in most cases , the goal is to preserve a given input state , but it may also be combined with gate operations @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "experimental results show that one of the main limitations for improving the decoupling efficiency are the non - ideal properties of the decoupling pulses @xcite .",
    "decoherence effects due to the environment can in principle be reduced by shortening the cycle time @xmath5 . however , in reality the pulse lengths are finite and the dd cycle time is limited by the available hardware . it is therefore important to find the best finite time sequences for decoupling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pulses do not only have finite lengths , they also do not implement perfect rotations .",
    "thus , increasing the number of pulses can result in a large overall error that destroys the qubit coherence instead of preserving it . as a result",
    ", the performance of the decoupling sequence may have an optimum at a finite cycle time @xcite . in this review ,",
    "we summarize the different dd strategies for fighting the effect of pulse imperfections and we show that they must be considered in the designing of useful dd sequences .    the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we give some basics of dynamical decoupling , in section iii we introduce the effects of pulse imperfections and in section iv we describe the strategies to fight against the imperfections effects . in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we consider a single qubit @xmath6 as the system that is coupled to the bath . in a resonantly rotating frame of reference @xcite ,",
    "the free evolution hamiltonian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the environment hamiltonian and @xmath9 is a general interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "@xmath10 are operators of the environment and @xmath11 the se coupling strength .",
    "the index @xmath12 runs over all modes of the environment .",
    "dephasing is due to an interaction that affects the @xmath13 component of the spin - system operator , and spin - flips are done trough the @xmath14 and/or @xmath15 operators .",
    "a heteronuclear spin - spin interaction involves a pure dephasing interaction .",
    "this type of interaction that is naturally encountered when the system can be distinguished from the environment can be found in a wide range of solid - state spin systems , as for example nuclear spin systems in nmr @xcite , electron spins in diamonds @xcite , electron spins in quantum dots @xcite , donors in silicon @xcite , etc . in other cases when the system and environment have similar energies ,",
    "the se interaction can include terms along the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath13 axis .",
    "dd is achieved by iteratively applying to the system a series of stroboscopic control pulses in cycles of period @xmath5 @xcite . over that period",
    ", the time - averaged se interaction can be described by an averaged or effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the goal of dd is the elimination of the effective se interaction .",
    "this can be seen by looking at hahn s pioneering spin - echo experiment @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ ddseqs]b ) .",
    "it is based on the application of a @xmath16-pulse to the spin system at a time @xmath17 after the spins were left to evolve in the magnetic field .",
    "this pulse effectively changes the sign of the system - environment ( se ) interaction , in this case the zeeman interaction with the magnetic field . letting the system to evolve for a refocusing period or time reversed evolution during the same duration",
    "@xmath17 generates the echo . if the magnetic field is static , the dynamics is completely reversed and the initial state of the spin recovered",
    "this is observed as the echo .",
    "however if the magnetic field fluctuates , its effect can not be reversed completely .",
    "thus , the echo amplitude decays as a function of the refocusing time @xcite .",
    "this decay contains information about the time - dependence of the environment .     dynamical decoupling pulse sequences .",
    "the empty and solid rectangles represent @xmath18 and @xmath19 pulses , respectively and @xmath20 represents the number of iterations of the cycle .",
    "( a ) initial state preparation .",
    "( b ) hahn spin - echo sequence .",
    "( c ) cpmg sequence .",
    "( d ) cdd sequence of order @xmath21 , cdd@xmath22 = c@xmath22 and c@xmath23.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    to reduce the decay rate of the echo due to a time - dependent environment , carr and purcell introduced a variant of the hahn - echo sequence , where the single @xmath16-pulse is replaced by a series of pulses separated by intervals of duration @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this cp sequence reduces the changes induced by the environment if the pulse intervals are shorter than the correlation time of the environment .",
    "however , as the number of pulses increases , pulse errors tend to accumulate .",
    "their combined effect can destroy the state of the system , rather than preserving it against the effect of the environment .",
    "this was noticed by meiboom and gill who proposed a modification of the cp sequence for compensating pulse errors , the cpmg sequence @xcite .",
    "cp and cpmg sequences are useful only when two of the spin operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 are affected by the environment .",
    "they can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a free evolution operator and @xmath26 is a @xmath16 pulse around the @xmath27 axis ( and the analogous for @xmath28 ) .",
    "the difference between the cp and cpmg sequence is the orientation of the rotation axis with respect to the initial condition . for applications in quantum information processing ,",
    "this distinction is not relevant , since all operations have to be independent of the initial condition .",
    "cp or cpmg is the shortest sequence of pulses for decoupling a se interaction that affects only two of the spin components @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xcite .    usually the average hamiltonian generated by dd sequences can be described by a series expansion , such as the magnus expansion@xcite .",
    "all the higher - order terms in this expansion describe imperfections , which reduce the fidelity of the sequence and should be eliminated .",
    "improving the dd performance is therefore related to reducing the contribution of higher order terms .",
    "this is closely related to efforts for developing better decoupling sequences for nmr @xcite . for quantum information processing ( qip ) , this lead to the design of sequences that make dd more effective , such as concatenated dynamical decoupling @xcite .",
    "an important innovation was due to g. uhrig @xcite , who proposed a sequence with non - equidistant pulse spacings , while all the standard sequences like cpmg are based on equidistant pulses .",
    "the udd sequence is defined by @xmath29 where the delays @xmath30 are determined by the positions @xmath31\\ ] ] of the pulses with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the lowest nontrivial order is equal to the cpmg sequence , udd@xmath34 cpmg .",
    "the effect of the non equidistant pulses can be discussed in the context of filter theory : dd can be considered as an environmental noise filter , where the distribution of pulses generates different filter shapes as a function of the frequencies .",
    "the overlap of this filter function with the spectral distribution of the environmental noise determines the decoherence rate @xcite .",
    "analogously , the filter shapes can be connected to diffraction patterns induced by interferences in the time domain @xcite .",
    "the uhrig dd sequence was shown theoretically to be the optimal sequence for reducing low frequency noise @xcite .",
    "this prediction was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that non - equidistant sequences perform better only for particular noise spectral densities that increase for higher frequencies and have a strong cut off . in usual case , where the spectral density decrease smoothly with the frequency , as usually happens with nmr spin baths , equidistant sequences were predicted @xcite and demonstrated @xciteto be the best option @xcite .    this filter function description can be traced back to previous nmr approaches @xcite and to work on universal dynamical control @xcite .",
    "choosing the times for the pulses leads to a variety of sequences that can be optimized according to the spectral density of the bath @xcite .    if the se interaction is a pure dephasing one , it is sufficient to apply pulses in one direction .",
    "however because every experimental setup has finite precision , pulse errors create an effective general se interaction @xcite . in this case",
    ", it was shown that sequences that are designed for general se interaction perform better than 1d sequences @xcite .",
    "if the system - environment interaction includes all three components of the system spin operator , decoupling can only be achieved if the sequence includes rotations around at least two different axes .",
    "the first decoupling sequence of this type is the xy-4 sequence , which alternates rotations around the x- and y - axes ( see fig .",
    "[ ddseqs ] d , @xmath35 ) .",
    "this sequence was initially used to eliminate the effect of pulse errors in the cp and cpmg sequences @xcite .",
    "it is also the shortest sequence for dd for general se interactions @xcite . in quantum information processing , where we consider the initial state to be unknown ,",
    "the cp and cpmg sequences , which correspond to a train of identical @xmath16-pulses , are identical @xcite .",
    "however , their effect on the quantum state depends on the ( generally unknown ) initial condition : if the initial condition is oriented along the rotation axis of the pulses , flip angle errors of the first pulse are refocused by the second pulse .",
    "however , for components perpendicular to the rotation axis , the pulse errors of all pulses add and cause rapid decay of the coherence , even in the absence of system - environment interactions @xcite .",
    "this motivated the development of the xy-4 sequence .",
    "in addition , pulse imperfections convert an ising - type system environment interaction into an effective general se interaction @xcite , which is not eliminated by the cp / cpmg sequence , but is partially eliminated by the xy-4 sequence . in the qip community , the xy-4 sequence is usually referred to as periodic dynamical decoupling ( pdd ) .",
    "the xy-4 sequence is also the building block for concatenated dd ( cdd ) sequences that improve the decoupling efficiency @xcite .",
    "the cdd scheme recursively concatenates lower order sequences to increase the decoupling power .",
    "the cdd evolution operator for its original version for a recursion order of @xmath21 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38=xy-4 .",
    "figure [ ddseqs ] shows a general scheme for this process .",
    "each level of concatenation reduces the norm of the first non - vanishing order term of the magnus expansion of the previous level , provided that the norm was small enough to begin with @xcite .",
    "this reduction comes at the expense of an extension of the cycle time by a factor of four .",
    "if the delays between the pulses are allowed to be non - equidistant like in udd , it becomes possible to create hybrid sequences , such as cudd @xcite and qdd @xcite .",
    "since the precision of any real operation is finite , the control fields used for decoupling introduce errors . depending on the sequence , these errors can accumulate .",
    "if the number of pulses is large and the sequence is not properly designed , the accumulated pulse errors can lead to severe loss of coherence than the effect of the environment . designing effective decoupling sequences that suppress environmental effects without degrading the system , even if the control fields have errors ,",
    "requires a careful analysis of the relevant errors and appropriate strategies for combining rotations in such a way that the errors cancel rather than accumulate .",
    "one example of a non - ideal control pulse is its finite duration , which implies a minimum achievable cycle time .",
    "the effects introduced by finite pulse lengths have been considered in different theoretical works @xcite .",
    "these works predict that high order cdd or udd sequences in general lose their advantages when the delays between pulses or pulse length are strongly constrained .",
    "while the limitation on the cycle reduces the maximal achievable dd performance , pulse errors can be even more destructive . in most cases ,",
    "the dominant cause of errors is a deviation between the ideal and the actual amplitude the of control fields .",
    "the result of this amplitude error is that the rotation angle experimentally implemented deviates from @xmath16 , typically by a few percent .",
    "another important error occurs when the control field is not applied in resonance with the transition of the qubit .",
    "this off - resonant effect produces a rotation in which the flip angle and the rotation axis deviate from the ideal ones .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     an example of the destructive effects of pulse imperfection is illustrated in the left panel of figure [ chim ] .",
    "here , we measured the magnetization decay of the @xmath39c nuclear spins during two different dd sequences .",
    "the sample used for this experiment was polycrystalline adamantane @xcite .",
    "the dephasing of the nuclear spins originates from the interaction with an environment consisting of @xmath40h nuclear spins and can be considered as a pure dephasing process .",
    "the first sequence considered in the figure is cpmg . in this case",
    "we can observe that the decay of the magnetization is imperceptibly slow when the system is initially oriented parallel to the rotation axis of the pulse ( longitudinal state ) . as we discuss below , this is an indication that the pulse errors have no effect on this initial state .",
    "in contrast , for a transverse initial state , the errors of the individual pulses accumulate and lead to a rapid decay , as shown in fig .",
    "a similar behavior is found for the udd sequence @xcite .",
    "the second dd sequence considered in fig . [ chim ] is the xy-4 sequence , which consists of pulses applied along the x and y axes .",
    "the alternating phases of the pulses results in a partial cancellation of pulse errors , independent of the initial condition @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the performance of this sequence is much more symmetric with respect to the initial state in the xy - plane and the average decay times are significantly longer @xcite .    in the context of quantum information processing ,",
    "it is important that the performance of gate operations be independent of the initial conditions ( which typically are unknown ) .",
    "a common choice for quantifying the performance of a general quantum operation is then the fidelity @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the target propagator for the process and @xmath44 the actual propagator . for the present situation ,",
    "where the goal is a quantum memory , the target propagator is the identity operation @xmath45 .",
    "we can not assume that the actual propagators are unitary .",
    "we therefore write the process as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the density matrices at the beginning and end of the process .",
    "the operators @xmath49 must form a basis .",
    "for the present case , we choose them as @xmath50 .",
    "the ideal and actual processes can therefore be quantified by the matrix elements @xmath51 . for the target evolution ,",
    "the @xmath52-matrix is @xmath53    the matrix elements for the actual process are determined experimentally by quantum process tomography @xcite .",
    "we use them to calculate the process fidelity from eq .",

    "after one cycle , the process matrices for both sequences represent a quantum operation that is close to the identity operation .",
    "the fidelity between the experimental matrices and the ideal matrix ( [ chiid ] ) is @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the cpmg and xy-4 cycles , respectively .",
    "measured over 40 cycles , the process matrices of the two sequences differ significantly from the identity operation but also from each order . for the xy-4 sequence ,",
    "the non - vanishing elements are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , while for cpmg the non - vanishing elements are @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "the two matrices represent therefore qualitatively different processes .",
    "the xy-4 sequence destroys all transversal magnetization , in this case the resulting density matrix is @xmath59 this corresponds to a projection of the density operator onto the @xmath13-axis , i.e. to a complete dephasing of the transverse components in the @xmath60-plane .",
    "the cpmg sequence , conversely , projects the density operator onto the @xmath14-axis : @xmath61 the cpmg is a spin lock @xcite sequence that allows retains magnetization in the @xmath14 direction but destroys all components perpendicular to it . since a real experimental implementation always generates a distribution of control field amplitudes , spins at different positions precess with different rates around the direction of the rf field . as a result , the perpendicular components become completely randomized after a sufficiently large overall flip angle as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ chim ] .",
    "the performance of experimentally accessible dd sequences is limited by the pulse errors @xcite . in many situations ,",
    "the dominating error contributions are flip angle and offset errors . in the next section",
    "we show different strategies to make decoupling sequences robust against such errors .",
    "we have to make decoupling insensitive to pulse imperfections .",
    "different possibilities for generating high - fidelity sequences have been proposed in the context of quantum information processing @xcite . here ,",
    "we discuss two possible approaches : first we show that it is possible to replace individual refocusing pulses by compensated pulses that implement very precise inversions , and then we discuss sequences that are inherently robust , i.e. insensitive to the imperfections of the individual pulses .      the simplest approach to make a sequence robust is by replacing every standard pulse by a robust composite pulse @xcite .",
    "the composite pulses are sequences of consecutive pulses designed to be robust against various classes of imperfections generating therefore rotations that are close to the ideal rotation even in the presence errors . particularly useful for quantum information applications are those composite pulses that produce compensated rotations for any initial condition , denominated in the nmr literature as class - a pulses @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have successfully used composite pulses to demonstrate the resulting increase of the performance of different dd sequences @xcite .",
    "these works have implemented the composite pulse defined as : @xmath62 which is equivalent to a robust @xmath16 rotation around the axis defined by @xmath63 followed by a @xmath64 rotation around the @xmath13 axis @xcite . for cyclic sequences , which always consist of even numbers of @xmath16 rotations , the effect of the additional @xmath13 rotation vanishes if the flip angle errors are sufficiently small .",
    "a comparison between standard sequences ( not using robust pulses ) against sequences with robust pulses has been reported in @xcite .",
    "it was observed that robust pulses improve the performance at high duty cycles .",
    "however , for low duty cycles , standard sequences perform better .",
    "this is due to the shorter cycle time of the standard sequence if constant duty cycles are compared .",
    "thus , if the objective is only to preserve a quantum state , the best performance is obtained at high duty cycles , using robust pulses .",
    "the best sequences that are suitable for parallel application of quantum gate operations are the self - correcting sequences discussed below .",
    "the composite pulses are usually designed to correct flip angle errors and offset errors . for compensating the effects introduced by the finite length of pulses ,",
    "some theoretical works have proposed that a finite pulse could be approximated as an instantaneous one by using an appropriate shaped pulse @xcite .",
    "these works has provided analytical and numerical evidence that a careful shape design can strongly affects the performance of decoupling sequences .",
    "an alternative to the use of composite pulses consists in making the decoupling sequences fault - tolerant without compensating the error of each pulse , but by designing them in such a way that the error introduced by one pulse is compensated by the other pulses of the cycle @xcite . a straightforward strategy for designing improved sequences",
    "consists in concatenating one basic building block cycle into a longer and robust cycle .    the xy-4 cycle is often chosen as the building block for constructing self - correcting sequences .",

    "are used @xcite .",
    "the basic cycle originally introduced in nmr shows reflection symmetry with respect to the center of the cycle .",
    "in contrast to that , the sequence used in the quantum information community is time asymmetric .",
    "one consequence of this small difference is that in the symmetric version , the echoes are formed in the center of the windows between any two pulses , while in the case of asymmetric cycles , the echoes coincide with every second pulse , as shown in figure [ ecos ] .",
    "the separation in time between the echoes is therefore twice as long in this case .",
    "if the environment is not static , the larger separation of the echoes leads to a faster decay of the echo amplitude @xcite .",
    "if a robust pulse only contains @xmath16 rotations , as in the case of ( [ kpul ] ) , it is also possible to convert such a composite pulse into a decoupling cycle by inserting delays between the individual @xmath16 rotations .",
    "this approach has been used in @xcite to build an self - correcting sequence .",

    "the different behavior of sequences consisting of symmetric vs. asymmetric blocks is illustrated in figure [ fidelxy ] .",
    "if we start from the symmetric form of xy-4 , the resulting xy-16 sequence shows much better performance than the sequence using the asymmetric xy-4 as the building block .",
    "analogous results were obtained for the two versions of the xy-8 sequence @xcite .",
    "earlier experiments showed two different contributions to the overall fidelity loss @xcite : a precession around the @xmath13-axis , which can be attributed to the combined effect of flip - angle errors and an overall reduction of the amplitude , which results from the system - environment interaction .",

    "dynamical decoupling is becoming a standard technique for preserving the coherence of quantum mechanical systems , which does not need control over the environmental degrees of freedom .",

    "the pioneering strategies for decoupling were introduced in the context of nmr spectroscopy @xcite . since then",
    ", many different decoupling sequences have been developed in the context of nmr @xcite or quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "generally , we can divide the dd sequences in two groups : ( i ) sequences that involve pulses in a single spatial direction and ( ii ) sequences that contain pulses in different spatial directions . the type ( i )",
    "sequences are strongly sensitive to pulse errors and are only capable of suppressing the effects of a purely dephasing environment or pure spin - flip interaction . examples of such dd sequences are cpmg and udd .",
    "the second group can suppress a general se interaction and usually exhibits better tolerance to experimental imperfections .",
    "example of such sequences are the xy - family ( xy-4 , xy-8 and xy-16 ) , the cdd sequences and the kdd sequence .",
    "recent experiments have successfully implemented dd methods and demonstrated the resulting increase of the coherence times by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these works also showed that the main limitation to the reduction of the decay rates are the imperfections of the pulse .",
    "two approaches have been used to correct this .",
    "the first approach replaces the inversion pulses by robust composite pulses @xcite , which generate rotations that are close to the target value even in the presence of pulse errors . in this case",
    ", the pulses are corrected individually .",
    "the second approach consists in designing the decoupling sequences in such a way that the error introduced by one pulse is compensated by the other pulses , without compensating the error of each pulse individually .",
    "the properties of basic decoupling cycles can be further improved by concatenating basic cycles into longer and more robust cycles .",
    "the concatenation can be made either by combining symmetry - related copies of a basic cycle subsequently @xcite ( resulting in the xy-8 and xy-16 sequences ) or by inserting the basic cycle into the delays of another cycle @xcite ( cdd sequences ) .",
    "the time reversal symmetry of the basic building blocks is a useful criterion for minimizing error contributions .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the sequences built from symmetric building blocks often perform better and never worse than sequences built from non - symmetric blocks @xcite .",
    "this is a significant advantage , considering that the complexity of the sequences based on symmetric or asymmetric blocks are identical .",
    "earlier experiments @xcite showed that the best sequences that are suitable for parallel application of quantum gate operations are the symmetric self - correcting sequences .",
    "however , as the delay between pulses decreases , sequences with robust pulses perform better .",
    "thus , if the objective is only to preserve a quantum state , the best performance is achieved by using robust pulses to correct pulse errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the kdd sequence introduced in @xcite combines the useful properties of self - correcting sequence with those of robust pulses and can thus be used for both quantum memory and quantum computing .    during the last years",
    ", many advances have been achieved . however , for the application of the technique in real quantum devices , further studies will certainly be required .",
    "so far , most work has focused on single qubit systems . in the future , more experimental tests will be needed with multi - qubit systems . in the field of quantum computation",
    ", another important development may result from the combination of dynamical decoupling sequences with those techniques used to implement robust quantum gates @xcite .",
    "since dd does not require auxiliary qubits or measurements , it can be used as an economical alternative to complement quantum error correction .",
    "some theoretical works @xcite proposed methods for combining the two methods but no experimental test was carried out to date .",
