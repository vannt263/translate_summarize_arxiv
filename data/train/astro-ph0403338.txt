    "in the hierarchical framework dwarf galaxies are considered to be the building blocks of larger baryonic structures , and observations indeed show that they are the most abundant galaxies in the universe . the sdss ( york 2000 ) and 2dfgrs ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ) surveys have shown that the galaxy luminosity function keeps rising down to the faintest magnitude probed ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 , norberg et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function depending on environment .",
    "hoyle et al . ( 2003 ) have found that sdss dwarf galaxies fainter than m@xmath7 -15 are not generally present in _ voids _ but preferentially populate _ overdense regions _",
    "( i.e. clusters ; cf .",
    "2004 , sabatini et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) theories predict mass functions for subhaloes with a very steep slope at the low mass end , virtually independent of the mass of the parent halo ( kravtsov et al .",
    "while this is true for the virgo cluster ( sandage et al .",
    "1985 , moore et al . 1999 ) , it is dramatically inconsistent with the observed galaxy content of the local group in which far fewer galaxies have been detected than one would navely expect for cdm cosmogonies ( klypin et al . 1999",
    "; moore et al .",
    "a number of mechanisms for suppressing dwarf galaxy formation have been included in cdm theories , such as supernova - driven winds ( dekel & silk 1986 ) and reionization ( bullock et al . 2000 ,",
    "tully et al .",
    "2002 , kravtsov et al .",
    "these authors have suggested that reionization could shape the environment dependence of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function , so that galaxy clusters assembled before reionization would be dwarf - galaxy rich in contrast with clusters formed after reionization ( the `` squelching '' effect ) .    counts of dwarf galaxies in galaxy groups and clusters indicate that they constitute the majority of the in - situ population , e.g. 80@xmath8 in the virgo cluster ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) and 90@xmath8 in the local group ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the best studied dwarf galaxies are in the local group , where they have been classified ( cf .",
    "ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) into dwarf ellipticals ( de : with a compact morphology and a high central surface brightness ) , spheroidals ( dsph : more diffuse structures with a low central surface brightness ) and irregulars ( dirr : with an irregular morphology and a significant content of ionized and neutral gas ) .",
    "des and dsphs are `` gas - free '' systems ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the differences observed in the kinematic properties and chemical abundances ( the latter being inferred from the well - known luminosity - metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies where dirrs are too metal - poor for their luminosity as compared to dsphs ) rule out that dirrs naturally evolve into dsphs and des ( binggeli 1994 , grebel et al .",
    "such a transition is rather induced by the environment , via tidal interaction with a closeby , more massive galaxy and via ram - pressure with the intergalactic medium in the local group , with the final effect of depleting dirrs of their original gas .",
    "indeed , observations indicate that dwarf ellipticals outnumber dwarf irregulars in the local group ( mateo 1998 ) , in hickson compact groups ( zepf et al .",
    "1997 ) and in the virgo cluster ( sandage et al . 1985 ) , while dwarf irregulars in the field dominate the galaxy luminosity function at m@xmath9 -18 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the local group ( as well as dwarf galaxies studied so far in the m81 group , caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) exhibit complicated star - formation histories and are characterized by a mixture of old- and intermediate - age stars ( des and dsphs ) at different metallicities , sometimes with traces of a more recent starbust ( few myrs ) like in dirrs ( grebel 1997 , mateo 1998 , tolstoy 2003 , grebel et al .",
    "although van den bergh ( 1994 ) suggested that dsph galaxies nearest to the milky way are on average older than more distant ones , there is no solid evidence for their star - formation history to be dependent on distance from the galaxy or m31 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "similarly , there is no clear understanding of the mechanisms driving star formation in the local group dwarfs .",
    "galactic outflows induced by supernova explosions , ram - pressure stripping , tidal stripping , galaxy threshing , galaxy harassment and mergers are all thought to play a role in controlling the star - formation activity and gas content in satellite dwarf galaxies ( grebel 1997 , moore et al . 1999 , bekki et al .",
    "there is no doubt that the dynamical evolution of a galaxy group `` washes out '' , in a sense , the pristine properties of the group dwarf galaxies .",
    "galaxy harassment in groups and clusters of galaxies can disturb large disk galaxies and transform them into dwarfs ( moore et al .",
    "1999 , gnedin 2003a ,",
    "galaxy interactions in compact groups are even able to produce an ex - novo generation of dwarf galaxies , the so called tidal debris dwarf galaxies ( cf .",
    "palma et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "have the truly pristine galaxy building blocks been found yet ?",
    "these are the unperturbed dwarf galaxies which most resemble the galaxy building blocks at high redshifts .",
    "in the nearby universe , tucana and cetus , two dsph galaxies , are located at about 880 kpc from the milky way and are considered practically unbound to the local group . unlike the satellite dsphs , they do not show any recent burst of star formation and their stellar populations date back to @xmath10 10 gyr ago ( mateo 1998 , grebel 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , they may well represent primordial dwarf galaxies , which have evolved as predicted by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) , i.e. dsphs descend from gaseous systems which lost their gas because of a single burst of star formation .",
    "in this paper we report on the first detection of a gas - poor dwarf galaxy which has undergone recent star formation and , yet , likely lies in the field , far away from any overdensity environment .",
    "we argue that this new galaxy , hereafter referred to as apples  1 , may be located at a fiducial distance of @xmath10 9 mpc and with an absolute magnitude of m@xmath11 -9.6 .",
    "this would make apples  1 possibly one of the faintest dwarf galaxies resolved in the field .",
    "its case would then set important constrains on feedback and on how star formation occurs in the smallest size scales of dark matter .",
    "the discussion on the nature of apples  1 develops following the timeline along which more data became available for this galaxy : first , the survey images alone which allowed us to study the morphology and structure of apples  1 , and finally the acs and vlt spectra which allowed us to estimate the distance and stellar content of this galaxy .",
    "our team has led the acs pure parallel ly@xmath12 emission survey programme ( apples , pi rhoads ) , a parallel programme approved for cycle 11 .",
    "the scope of this programme was to collect pairs of direct and grism images of random fields at high galactic latitude in order to study galaxy populations at redshifts greater than 1 ( pasquali et al .",
    "2003b ) . the observational techniques and the data - reduction strategy applied to imaging and spectroscopy are fully described in pirzkal et al .",
    "briefly , the observations were carried out with the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) , and consisted of pairs of direct and grism images for a total exposure time of 1460 s in imaging and 3470 s in spectroscopy .",
    "the direct images were acquired throught the f775w filter and were used to accurately measure the position of sources on the chips , which fixes the zero point of the wavelength calibration of their grism spectra ( cf .",
    "pasquali et al .",
    "the direct images were reduced using calacs ( hack 1999 ) and pydrizzle ( sparks et al .",
    "the acs pipeline was only partially run on the grism images , to allow the correction for bias , dark current and for the different detectors gain .",
    "spectra were extracted from each grism image and calibrated with the st - ecf package axe ( pirzkal et al .",
    "2001 ) , which has built - in the correction for flat - field , the wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "multiple spectra of the same source were then medianed .    in the direct images",
    ", we detected an isolated and compact stellar system .",
    "the field appears sparsely populated by galaxies , with very few field stars ; the stellar system is characterized by a circularly symmetric concentration of numerous faint , point - like sources . in figure 1 , we compare the image of this stellar system taken with the acs / wfc ( 9@xmath13 9@xmath14 , middle panel ) with the dss image of the galactic gc pal 13 ( 5@xmath15 5@xmath16 , left - hand side panel ) and the v - band image of the dwarf galaxy and v ( 3@xmath15 3@xmath16 , right - hand side panel ) published by armandroff et al .",
    "the stellar system is itself visible on the dss as a faint and unresolved point source .",
    "following the iau rules , we have named this newly discovered system apples  1 .",
    "we have observed apples  1 with fors2 on the eso vlt / ut4 as part of the director general discretionary time ( program i d 271.d-5043a , pi : pasquali ) , on august 30 2003 .",
    "specifically , we have performed low - resolution spectroscopy in the range 3500   - 9000    through the gris@xmath17300v grism and for a total exposure time of 1.5 hours .",
    "the adopted slit was 1.6 arcsec wide resulting in an effective dispersion of 3.3  / pix .",

    "photometry of point sources in apples 1 was carried out with the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) , running within iraf .",
    "point sources were first detected by running the daofind task with a detection threshold of 3 sigma above the background noise .",
    "aperture and psf photometry were then obtained with the phot and allstar tasks .",
    "following the first pass of allstar photometry , the daofind task was run a second time on the residual image produced by allstar in order to detect additional objects which might have been missed in the first pass due to crowding , especially near the centre of apples 1 .",
    "the two object lists were then merged and the phot @xmath20 allstar sequence repeated .",
    "finally , the photometry was calibrated to the vegamag system by measuring a few isolated stars in the image in a @xmath21 aperture and applying the zero - points in de marchi et al .",

    "to be the smallest dwarf galaxy ever resolved .",
    "so far we have compared the spectroscopic data from the core of apples  1 with either stellar data or simple stellar populations which correspond to a single age and metallicity . except for small systems such as globular clusters , formed over timescales much shorter than those expected for the enrichment of the ism",
    ", one should expect the stellar populations to be composed of a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "however , the age - metallicity degeneracy ( worthey 1994 ) poses a major hurdle in the estimate of the star formation history from integrated photo - spectroscopic data .",
    "a model - dependent approach involves the generation of a composite stellar population according to a star formation history which consistently determines the age and metallicity distributions of the stellar component .",
    "we have followed the galactic chemical enrichment model described in detail in ferreras & silk ( 2000 ; 2003 ) and references therein .",
    "this model reduces the process of star formation to three mechanisms , namely :    * infall of primordial gas following a generic function .",
    "we assume this function to be a delayed exponential : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the infall rate is characterized by two parameters , the formation redshift ( @xmath70 ) which fixes the epoch when infall starts , and the timescale @xmath71 .",
    "this function rises quickly to its maximum value at @xmath72 and then declines on a slower timescale . after a time @xmath73",
    ", 90% of the total gas content has fallen on the galaxy * the infall of gas feeds the gas reservoir which processes gas into stars via a schmidt law : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the star formation efficiency and @xmath76 refers to the total baryon content .",
    "@xmath76 is just a normalization term included so that @xmath75 is given in gyr@xmath6 .",
    "the inverse of the star formation efficiency is the star formation timescale .",
    "values of @xmath75 are usually low for late - type systems ( @xmath77  gyr@xmath6 , e.g. boissier et al .",
    "2001 ) and higher for elliptical galaxies ( @xmath78  gyr@xmath6 , ferreras & silk 2000 ) .",
    "* outflows play an important role in the chemical enrichment history as they `` modulate '' the yield and alter the gas content in the reservoir .",
    "we include a free parameter ( @xmath79 ) which describes the fraction of gas and metals ejected in outflows from evolved stars .",
    "these outflows are mainly dominated by type  ii supernovae ejecta .",
    "type ia sne are included following ferreras & silk ( 2002 ) who assume the prescription of greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) for a single degenerate progenitor .",
    "therefore , for a given choice of the four parameters described above , namely : @xmath80 , we solve for the star formation history ( sfh ) which gives us the age and metallicity distribution of the resulting composite stellar populations .",
    "this sfh is convolved with the latest bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) population synthesis models to generate a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with 3   fwhm resolution in the region of interest .",
    "a comparison of the model sed and the vlt spectrum of the core of apples  1 is then performed via a @xmath81 test in which the model sed is smoothed to the lower resolution of the observations ( fwhm@xmath82 ) and normalized to the same flux integrated in the spectral region of interest .",
    "the observed sed is in the range @xmath83 , sampled at @xmath84     per pixel , but we clipped it to a shorter interval to reduce noise and to improve the accuracy of our age and metallicity estimates .",
    "furthermore , we resampled the spectrum , doing a 3  pixel rebinning in order to work with a pixel size roughly larger than the fwhm .",
    "we mainly truncated the spectrum at the red end , using a spectral range @xmath85  @xmath86 . in the analysis of the likelihood function",
    ", we assumed a 7% uncertainty per ( unbinned ) pixel in the spectrum .",
    "we chose a large range of star formation histories solving the chemical enrichment model described above for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we explored 11 different values of the outflow fraction from @xmath87 to @xmath88 in steps of @xmath89 . for each choice , we computed a grid of @xmath90 models for a wide range of star formation efficiencies : @xmath91 , formation times : @xmath92 and infall",

    "the error bars are given at the @xmath94 confidence level , but we warn the reader to consider these results as rough estimates .",
    "indeed , one should notice that the small uncertainty in the average age or metallicity is not very meaningful since the spread in ages and metallicities is rather large .",
    "nevertheless , the strength of the prediction lies in the need for a wide distribution of ages and metallicities .",
    "the best model requires a rather low star formation efficiency , comparable to those found in low - mass disk galaxies . the combination of a low efficiency with an extended infall timescale results in a significant ongoing star formation , suggesting that the core of apples  1 is still in its starting stages of formation .",
    "strong constraints can not be imposed on some of the parameters such as the outflow fraction or the infall timescale . the star formation efficiency and especially the formation redshift  which roughly determines the average age of the stellar populations  are significantly constrained .",
    "figure  11 gives the age and metallicity histograms ( left panels ) and their cumulative distribution ( right panels ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to two extreme star formation histories within the @xmath94 confidence levels , labelled as h1 and h2 . in both scenarios",
    "we assume @xmath95  gyr .",
    "( solid line ) represents a late ( @xmath96 ) and low - efficiency formation process ( @xmath97  gyr@xmath6 ) with no outflows , whereas h2 ( dashed line ) corresponds to an early ( @xmath98 ) and highly efficient formation history ( @xmath99  gyr@xmath6 ) with some outflows ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "both models yield a significant fraction of stars younger than @xmath101  gyr , with an average age around @xmath102  gyr .",
    "this average age corresponds to a main sequence turnoff at around an f stellar type , in agreement with the previous comparison of apples  1 with stellar spectra .",
    "the age distribution allows for a non - negligible ongoing star formation , as seen by the presence of ob stars .",
    "the star and its ( @xmath94 ) error bar in the left panels represent the best fit for a comparison of the apples  1 spectrum with a grid of simple stellar populations ( i.e. single age and metallicity ) , drawn from the same synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between a composite model and a simple stellar population is remarkable .",
    "this should serve as a cautionary warning in the use of simple stellar populations to explore the star formation histories of unresolved stellar populations . from a statistical point of view",
    "the analysis with a simple stellar population gives an equally acceptable fit , with a reduced @xmath103 .",
    "the strong balmer absorption lines seen in the sed of apples  1 are characteristic of  1 gyr old stars , as seen in figure  10 .",
    "hence , the use of simple stellar populations imposes a single age , which creates the significant shift towards younger ages in order to recover these strong absorption lines .",
    "the weakness of the observed ca @xmath104 line favors models with subsolar metallicity , as opposed to the ssp prediction .",
    "furthermore , the presence of ob stars along with the fors2 integrated spectrum matching a cooler f spectral type ( see  4 ) suggests a significant range of ages .",
    "all this evidence points towards an extended period of star formation as implied by the chemical enrichment models .",
    "figure  12 shows the best fit sed ( dashed line ) along with the observed vlt / fors2 spectrum ( solid line ) .",
    "the residuals are given in the bottom panel , in the same units , namely @xmath105  erg  s@xmath6  cm@xmath3  @xmath6 .",
    "the inset shows the range of star formation histories within the @xmath94 confidence level ( i.e. histories h1 and h2 defined above ) .",
    "the dashed lines give the range of star formation rates , whereas the solid lines trace the evolution of the metallicity of the ism .",
    "the point gives the marginalized average age and metallicity along with the rms shown as error bars .",
    "the best fit of the models to the spectrum of apples  1 suggests ongoing star formation which  scaled to an absolute luminosity @xmath107  should be of order @xmath108  yr@xmath6 .",
    "however , the lack of emission lines would rather suggest the contrary .",
    "a rough estimate of the h@xmath12 and [ oii ] luminosities expected from star formation ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ) readily shows that the vlt spectrum of the apples  1 core strongly rules out instantaneous star formation rates as those suggested by the models .",
    "however , recent star formation is obvious from the presence of ob stars as seen by the acs / g800l grism data .",
    "this dichotomy is reconciled when feedback plays a major role .",
    "delayed self - regulation of star formation has been known to cause an overstability that drives strong oscillations in the star formation rate ( struck - marcell & scalo 1987 ; parravano 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , evidence of such intermittent behavior has been presented in our milky way from a detailed study of the chromospheric age distribution of 552 stars in the solar neighborhood ( rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2000 ) . hence , we expect apples  1 to have a complex , intermittent star formation history , which explains the presence of ob stars and the lack of line emission .",
    "the chemical enrichment model presented here gives just a `` smoothed view '' of the actual formation process .",
    "the stellar continuum  which we have used as the main constraint on the stellar ages and metallicities  can not be used to probe into these oscillations , whose characteristic timescales are @xmath109  myr ( parravano 1996 ) .",
    "needless to say , the predictions from this simple chemical enrichment model should be taken as rough estimates of the age and metallicity distribution of the stellar component of the core of apples  1 .",
    "it should be viewed as a first - order approximation to the star formation history  the zeroth - order being the analysis of simple stellar populations .",
    "we want to emphasize that the addition of a consistent model of chemical enrichment allows us to take into account the strong bias imposed by the small @xmath110 of young stars whose main effect is to reduce luminosity - derived ages , as seen in figure 12 .",
    "more complicated models including intermittent star formation will be more realistic .",
    "however , the effect on the spectral energy distribution is very hard to distinguish from a more monotonic approach as the one shown above , and calls for a more detailed analysis involving _ resolved _ stellar color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "one could still argue that young stellar populations dominate the observed sed , so that a large fraction of old ( and low - mass ) stars could go unnoticed by this analysis , implying a large underestimate of the stellar age . in order to check this point , we ran a grid of models which combined the best fit sed with a simple stellar population over a range of ages between 8 and 13  gyr and metallicities @xmath111 .",
    "a third parameter ( @xmath112 ) controls the stellar mass fraction in this ( old ) simple stellar population .",
    "the resulting seds were compared with the observations in the same way as described above , to find that the best model corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath114 is ruled out at the @xmath94 confidence level .",
    "hence we can conclude that a significant contribution to the _ observed spectrum _ of the core of apples  1 from old stars is unlikely .",
    "as indicated in sect.3.1 , apples  1 is located in the direction of the sculptor group .",
    "the canonical members of this galaxy group ( i.e. ngc  55 , ngc  247 , ngc  253 , ngc  300 and ngc  7793 ) are characterized by a radial velocity between 120 and 230 km  s@xmath6 and span a distance range between 1.6 and 3.4 mpc ( puche & carignon 1988 , freedman et al .",

    "hence , the spectra strongly suggests an extended period of star formation over several gyr .",

    "tidal interactions , ram - pressure , collisions , merger events and ionization from the uv background are thought to regulate the depletion of gas ( primordial and ejected by stars during their evolution ) and the star formation in satellite dsphs ( cf .",
    "grebel et al .",

    "alternatively , these dwarf galaxies could have been more massive in the past and had been heated and truncated by the tidal interactions with the massive neighbors at high redshift , as suggested by kravtsov et al .",

    "certainly , a better knowledge of their orbital parameters would greatly help in understanding their origin .",
    "if these ruled out the occurrence of any major interactions with the milky way , then tucana and cetus would have evolved as predicted by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) with supernova explosions removing their gas .",
    "the key point , here , is to determine the full star formation history experienced by apples  1 .",
    "for example , the best fitting model of chemical enrichment ( as well as the lick line indices ) indicates that the vlt spectrum of the core of apples  1 is dominated by young and intermediate - age stars with a negligible contribution from old stars to the optical light .",

    "<S> during the apples parallel campaign , the hst advanced camera for surveys has resolved a distant stellar system , which appears to be an isolated dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> it is characterized by a circularly symmetric distribution of stars with an integrated magnitude @xmath0 = 20.13 @xmath1 0.02 , a central surface brightness @xmath2 21.33 @xmath1 0.18 mag  arcsec@xmath3 and a half - light radius of @xmath4 1.8 arcsec . </S>",
    "<S> the acs and vlt spectra show no evidence of ionized gas and appear dominated by a 3 gyr old stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> the ob spectral type derived for two resolved stars in the grism data and the systemic radial velocity ( v@xmath5 670 km  s@xmath6 ) measured from the vlt data give a _ </S>",
    "<S> fiducial _ distance of @xmath4 9 @xmath1 2 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> these findings , with the support of the spatial morphology , would classify the system among the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> following the iau rules , we have named this newly discovered galaxy apples  1 . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing peculiarity of apples  1 is that the properties ( age and metallicity ) of the stellar content so far detected are similar to those of dsph galaxies in the local group , where star formation is thought to be driven by galaxy interactions and mergers . </S>",
    "<S> yet , apples  1 seems not to be associated with a major group or cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , apples  1 could be the first example of a field dsph galaxy with self - sustained and regulated star formation and , therefore , would make an interesting test case for studies of the formation and evolution of unperturbed dsph galaxies . </S>"
