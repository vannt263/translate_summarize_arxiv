    "stimulated raman spectroscopy has become in recent years one of the most useful and powerful tools for laser manipulation of cold atoms .",
    "raman stimulated transitions have been used , for example , in subrecoil laser cooling @xcite ; for the preparation of bloch states in a stationary wave @xcite ; to perform  sideband \" cooling of trapped atoms @xcite ; and in subrecoil - precision measurement of atomic velocity distributions in quantum chaos experiments @xcite .",
    "this powerful technique is however plagued by its sensitivity to stray magnetic fields that should imperatively be compensated for . in the present paper , we describe a setup used in the above mentioned quantum chaos experiment for subrecoil - precision measurements of velocity distributions of cold atoms , with a special emphasis in a method for reducing stray magnetic fields to a sub - milligauss level by active compensation .",
    "all experiments reported below were done with cesium atoms , widely used in the present context , but most conclusions drawn in the present paper can be applied to other atomic species .",
    "cesium recoil velocity @xmath1 ( i.e. the velocity acquired by an atom emitting or absorbing a single photon ) corresponding to the usual @xmath2 line near 852 nm is 3.5 mm / s .",
    "the doppler shift associated with a stimulated raman transition at such a velocity is 8.4 khz .",
    "let us briefly review some relevant features of the raman stimulated spectroscopy . in the present context ,",
    "raman stimulated transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ramantransitions ] ) are _ two - photon _ transitions connecting one hyperfine sublevel of the ground state to the other one by the absorption of a single photon in one raman beam of frequency @xmath3 and wavenumber @xmath4 and by _ stimulated _ emission of a photon in the other beam ( frequency @xmath5 and wavenumber @xmath6 ) _ via _ a virtual excited level .",
    "the raman process is resonant if the frequency difference of the two raman beams and the ground - state hyperfine interval ( @xmath7 9.2 ghz for cesium ) are equal , and the raman detuning for zero magnetic field , low laser intensity and zero - velocity atoms is defined as @xmath8 we suppose that the raman beams are either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "in what follows we shall neglect @xmath9 compared to @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and take @xmath12 . if the raman beams are counterpropagating ( i. e. @xmath13 )",
    ", the detuning seen by an atom of velocity @xmath14 is @xmath15 , and the atomic velocity sensitivity of the transition will be maximum and so is the momentum exchange between the raman beams and the atom .",
    "this last property provides a way to perform subrecoil cooling @xcite . on the other hand , if the two raman beams have the same propagation direction ( i. e. @xmath16 ) the raman detuning is almost insensitive to the atomic velocity . as sensitivity to magnetic fields and to light - shifts",
    "is preserved , co - propagating raman spectroscopy is very useful for the calibration of the apparatus .    since the life time of the @xmath17 sublevel is very long ( several thousand years in the absence of collisions ) , the width of the raman stimulated transitions will be , in principle , limited by heisenberg principle of uncertainty .",
    "the transitions linewidths are thus proportional to the inverse of the excitation duration .",
    "for instance , a raman pulse duration of about 20 @xmath18s , in the counter - propagating configuration , leads to a velocity resolution of @xmath1 .",
    "if the amplitude of the pulse is adjusted to produce a @xmath19 pulse , it will transfer a whole velocity class of width of @xmath1 centered at the velocity @xmath20 from one hyperfine sublevel to the other one .",
    "one can then reconstruct the atomic velocity distribution by measuring the transferred atomic population as a function of the raman detuning @xmath21 .",
    "finally , in order to prevent resonant transitions to ( and spontaneous emission from ) the excited state , the virtual intermediate level must lie far enough from the closest excited level , what can be achieved by choosing an optical detuning @xmath22 much larger than the linewidth of the closest excited level .",
    "typically @xmath23 ghz in our experiment , to be compared to the @xmath24 mhz linewidth of the excited level .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate is thus reduced by about 9 orders of magnitude with respect to the resonance .",
    "this is true in the limit of a narrow laser line ; we have however noticed that power diode lasers present a large spectral background about 40 db below the peak intensity that limits the reduction of the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the optical part of our raman setup has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , the raman frequencies are generated by direct current modulation at 4.6 ghz of a diode laser .",
    "the current modulation generates two optical sidebands separated by 9.2 ghz that are used to perform injection - lock of two independent power diode lasers .",
    "we obtain in this way two 150 mw laser beams with the required frequency separation and with a beat - note width below 1 hz .",
    "the raman beams then pass through three acousto - optical modulators acting as optical switches that control the interaction time and allow shifting from the co- to the counter - propagating beam configuration .",
    "finally , the resulting beams are transported by monomode , polarization maintaining , optical fibers to the region of interaction with the atomic cloud .",
    "the ground state of cesium splits into two hyperfine sublevels @xmath25 and @xmath17 separated by 9.2 ghz ( the cesium - clock frequency ) .",
    "the linear zeeman split for these states is of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the magnetic field , @xmath28 the azimuthal quantum number and @xmath29 the zeeman coefficient ( around 350 khz / g in modulus ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cesiumlevels ] ) .",
    "an atom in the @xmath17 hyperfine sublevel undergoing a 6 mg magnetic field ( 2 % of the earth s mean magnetic field ) will experience a zeeman broadening equal to the recoil velocity doppler - shift .",
    "thus , in order to perform atomic velocity manipulation with subrecoil resolution , stray magnetic fields should be reduced to the mg level or below .",
    "usually , this is done by shielding the experimental zone with a double  mu - metal \" sheet providing a high degree of isolation against magnetic fields .",
    "however , the shield reduces the optical access to the experiment and , as mu - metal is difficult to tool , it also tends to forbid further evolution of the setup .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic gradient of a magneto - optical trap magnetizes the shield on the scale of a day can lead , leading to a slow magnetic field drift .",
    "it is thus interesting to perform an acceptable field reduction without any  physical \" shield . in general the local magnetic field across the experiment is a sum of several components : dc earth field ; dc stray fields , e. g. from an ion - pump permanent magnet ; ac components from the line ( 50 hz or 60 hz ) and its harmonics ; etc .",
    "this means that the magnetic field configuration is greatly dependent on the particular setup one wants to protect , and that a dc magnetic field compensation alone is insufficient .",
    "to overcome most of those problems , the method we describe here is to perform a real - time compensation of the magnetic field in the three directions with , for each direction , dc and ac compensations . in order to do so",
    ", we use the fact that the sum of the magnetic fields at the eight corners of a cube gives eight times the magnetic field at the center of this cube .",
    "this result is independent of the gradient of the field , and the first non - vanishing correction is of second order in the magnetic field @xcite    in practice , we placed twenty - four magneto - resistive probes at the eight corners of the vacuum cell , three at each corner oriented according to the three orthogonal directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] ) .",
    "the probes are mounted on two u - shaped integrated circuits placed parallel to the top and bottom faces of the cell , preserving a large optical access to the cell .",
    "a maximum of algebraic operation is performed directly on the integrated circuits in order to reduce the number of external electric connections .",
    "the sum of the eight signals for a given direction generates three error signals : each error signal is integrated and the result is used to drive a current supply ( we simply use standard diode laser supplies in our setup ) _ via _ a modulation input . each supply drives a coil pair in helmholtz configuration generating a magnetic field opposite to that measured by the probes .",
    "the rectangular compensating coils are typically 1.5 meter wide in order to insure the homogeneity of the compensated magnetic field across the vacuum cell ( whose size is 10 cm ) .",
    "the magneto - resistive probes ( hmc2003 honeywell ) have , according to the manufacturer data , a resolution better than 40 @xmath0 . in closed - loop operation , the residual magnetic field fluctuation measured by the probes is 150 @xmath0 , corresponding to a reduction of one order of magnitude , and the bandwidth is better than 500 hz .",
    "we took care of aligning the probes axes with the axes of the compensation coils to better than five degrees , and we never saw any instabilities due to the coupling among the three directions with the three servo - loops acting simultaneously . with this setup ,",
    "canning the dc magnetic field component along one direction ( by scanning the respective dc current ) does not affect the stability of the compensation along the other directions , even in presence of unavoidable stray couplings among directions , which are correctly compensated by the device .    a good way of testing the effectiveness our setup is to perform _ co - propagating _ raman spectroscopy .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] that such a configuration is almost insensitive to the atomic velocity , and it allows easy diagnostic of perturbing effects like residual stray magnetic fields and light - shifts . to do so",
    ", we programmed our experiment to execute the following time sequence : the magneto - optical ( mot ) trap is loaded ; the mot gradient of magnetic field is shut down and a `` sisyphus '' sequence is applied for further cooling .",
    "twenty millisecond after cutting the mot gradient , the magneto - resistive probes are reset .",
    "reseting must be done before the probes can perform measurements once they have been submitted to intense magnetic fields ( e. g. the mot gradient ) .",
    "a special function is provided in the probe chip for this end .",
    "a few millisecond later , the servo loops are switched on .",
    "after twenty milliseconds , the optical beams are shut down , the atoms are transfered form the @xmath17 to the @xmath25 sublevel and the raman pulse is applied .",
    "the sisyphus sequence lasts for around 60 ms which is longer than in other cold atom experiments ( typically 30 ms ) , but is much shorter than the requested delay ( around 200 ms ) when a mu - metal shield is used , necessary to allow for the shield magnetization relaxation .    by applying a dc magnetic field during the experiment",
    ", one can perform spectroscopy of cesium ground - level zeeman states .",
    "if the dc field has no particular orientation with respect to the polarizations of the raman beams @xcite , the selection rules for the raman transitions are @xmath30 . as the zeeman coefficient for @xmath25 and @xmath17 are almost equal and have opposite signs , @xmath31 khz / g and @xmath32 khz / g , the position ( with respect to the line center ) of the line connecting the sublevels @xmath33 and @xmath34 is @xmath35 b \\text{(g ) .}\\ ] ]    as we are dealing with weak magnetic fields , the second term in the brackets is in general negligible , and we can consider that the position of the lines depends only on @xmath36 .",
    "one easily deduces that the spectrum can display up to 15 lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcspectrum ] .",
    "this figure has been obtained by applying a dc field of 28 mg with the magnetic field compensation setup described above active .",
    "the raman pulse duration is 500 @xmath18s . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] we compare a  zoom \" of the line noted -6 in fig . [",
    "fig : dcspectrum ] with the magnetic field active compensation on and off , clearly showing a noise reduction effect .",
    "when the compensation is off , only the dc component remains .",
    "the maximum measured full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcspectrum ] are around 1.5 khz , which means that the resolution is independent of the magnetic sublevel and limited by the fourier transform of the raman pulse . for longer interaction times , we have observed a linewidth of 600 hz which correspond to a velocity resolution better than @xmath37 and thus to a field residual amplitude of 300 @xmath0 . to achieve this last value",
    ", we added a gradient - compensating coil pair in anti - helmholtz configuration , that generates a 10 mg / cm gradient to eliminate residual mot - gradient magnetic fields .    reducing the dc field leads to a collapsed , zeeman - compensated spectrum , with a fwhm of about 4 khz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : collapsedspectrum ] ) . in principle",
    ", one would expect the width of the collapsed spectrum to be just slightly greater than the widest line of the split spectrum .",
    "explaining this  unexpected \" broadening is the purpose of the next section .    with the performances described above , we easily achieved a velocity - measurement resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : contraprop ] present a measurement of the velocity distribution of the cesium atoms .",
    "the fwhm is 82 khz , corresponding to a temperature of 3.3 @xmath18k which is typical of  sisyphus - boosted \" mots .",
    "this proves the ability of the setup to perform subrecoil spectroscopy .    concluding this section",
    ", we can say that this setup displays a sufficient resolution to be used in most raman stimulated spectroscopy experiments .",
    "furthermore , there is hardly any reduction of the optical access to the vacuum cell .",
    "let us however mention that the setup presents a serious limitation in the everyday use .",
    "we observed that the hmc2003 probes have a slow time - drift , with a time constant of roughly one hour .",
    "this implies that the dc component of the magnetic field compensation has to be readjusted regularly .",
    "we accounted for this effect by a software procedure restoring a fixed value of the magnetic field ( as measured by the probes ) , for instance each hour .",
    "we also tested the possibility of replacing the magneto - resistive probes by small coils and use the induction signal to generate an ac error signal .",
    "this technique apparently presents no detectable drift .",
    "the relative intensity of the raman transitions depends on the raman amplitude connecting the respective zeeman sublevels , which is proportional to the product of the dipole matrix elements connecting each sublevel to the concerned intermediate excited level ( see appendix [ app : formulas ] ) .",
    "the position of each zeeman sublevel depends on the magnetic field and on the intensity of the raman beams through the light - shift , which , for the far detuned raman beams we are considering here , depends only on the dipole matrix element connecting the considered zeeman sublevel to the excited level .",
    "we choose the magnetic field @xmath39 to be parallel to the quantization axis , labeled @xmath40 .",
    "the raman beams are co - propagating with wavevector @xmath41 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : geometry ] ) , and lie in the @xmath42 plane , making an angle @xmath43 with respect to the @xmath40-axis .",
    "the ( orthogonal ) polarization vectors associated with the two raman beams lie in a plane orthogonal to @xmath41 , and the polarization of the raman beam starting from the level @xmath25 makes an angle @xmath44 with the @xmath42 plane ( this last angle is irrelevant in the weak magnetic field limit , we shall thus always take @xmath45 in what follows ) .",
    "we consider three main causes of line broadening : ( a ) magnetic field fluctuations and inhomogeneities , ( b ) fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the intensity of the raman beams , and ( c ) the finite duration of the pulses .",
    "we shall consider each of these effects in detail .",
    "the fluctuations of the magnetic field displace the zeeman sublevels , and thus displace the center of each raman line ( except the line connecting the zeeman @xmath46 sublevels , if allowed ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider that the magnetic field in our setup results from the vectorial addition of a controlled , dc vector @xmath47 and of a randomly fluctuating component @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting magnetic field thus varies both in modulus and in direction .",
    "the quantization axis is aligned with the dc component .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field also displaces the position of the raman lines , thus contributing to the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "we do not know the exact distribution of the magnetic field intensity over the atomic cloud , but as the atoms have an almost random spatial distribution , this contribution can be statistically treated in the same way as a field fluctuation and we do not distinguish between them .",
    "the typical magnitude of this effect in the weak magnetic field regime is 1.5 khz .",
    "the dominant low - magnetic field broadening factor is the fluctuation of the light - shifts ( as for the magnetic field effect , we do not distinguish the contributions of fluctuations and of inhomogeneities ) .",
    "these fluctuations are in part due to the fluctuations of the intensity of the raman beams themselves .",
    "however , the light - shift affecting a given zeeman sublevel @xmath49 is _ independent of @xmath50 and @xmath51 if the direction of the magnetic field is parallel to the direction of propagation of the raman beams _ ( this result is also valid for zero magnetic field , as one can then always chose the quantization axis parallel to the beams ) .",
    "this implies that the light - shift fluctuations in this configuration displace the lines as a whole , and can not contribute to the broadening of an individual line .",
    "this fact shall play an essential role in the following of this section .",
    "thus , we do not expect the best compression of the spectrum to be achieved with zero dc field , because in this case the fluctuating component @xmath48 induces magnetic field random rotations with respect to @xmath41 , leading to spectra that are broad and asymmetric .",
    "the thinnest lines are expected to be obtained with a dc field parallel to the raman beams of an amplitude a few times greater than the mean amplitude of the fluctuating component : in such case , the fluctuation of the magnetic field induce only small misalignments with respect to propagation direction of the raman beams .",
    "we verified these facts both experimentally and numerically ( see below ) .",
    "let us mention that a simple way to obtain the alignment of the dc field and the raman beams is to try to minimize the amplitude of the lines corresponding to @xmath52 ( that is , -7,-5, ..",
    ",5,7 ) in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : dcspectrum ] , as the raman selection rules forbid such transitions if @xmath53 and @xmath41 are parallel .",
    "if the axes of the compensation coils are aligned with the raman beams ( as it is the case in our setup ) , one can reduce the dc component without loosing the correct field orientation .    lowering the intensity of the raman beams produces thinner linewidths , but the overall signal also decreases , specially when performing counter - propagating ( velocity - sensitive ) raman spectroscopy .",
    "the intensity used in our quantum chaos experiment @xcite and in the curves shown in the present paper is 20 mw for each raman beam of waist 4 mm .",
    "the typical value of the broadening associated with the light - shift fluctuations is 3.5 khz .",
    "the last broadening effect is the finite duration of the raman pulses .",
    "we worked with raman pulses ranging from 1 to 3 ms for which the associated broadening ( around 0.2 khz ) is negligible .",
    "numerically calculated spectra have been generated by a monte - carlo technique .",
    "a particular value for the magnetic field is generated by adding a dc component @xmath54 making an angle @xmath55 with @xmath41 and a perturbation@xmath48 , whose amplitude is picked from a gaussian distribution of zero mean , root - mean - square amplitude @xmath56 , and of random orientation .",
    "note that @xmath57 is formed by two contributions : the stray local fields ( independent of @xmath58 ) and the fluctuations of @xmath58 itself , which we assume to be proportional to @xmath58 ( due e. g. to fluctuations of the current delivered by the supplies ) .",
    "in the same way , a value for the intensity of each raman beam is picked from a gaussian distribution of mean intensity @xmath59 and root - mean - square variation @xmath60 .",
    "the position and the amplitude of each line is then calculated , and a particular spectrum generated using the `` natural '' linewidth given by the inverse of the pulse duration .",
    "typically 1000 of such randomized spectra are averaged to produce the spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dcspectrum ] and [ fig : collapsedspectrum ] .    as expected , the best collapsed spectrum is obtained for a non - zero value of the dc field .",
    "[ fig : fwhmxb0 ] displays the numerically calculated dependence of the fwhm on the dc magnetic field @xmath58 , showing a well defined minimum around @xmath61 mg . for",
    "stronger mean fields , the broadening is dominated by the fluctuations of @xmath58 itself , and should be linear ion @xmath58 . for values @xmath58 close to zero , the broadening is due essentially to field rotations induced by the fluctuation component .",
    "the fluctuations of the field direction are roughly proportional to @xmath62 and the related broadening is maximum if @xmath63 , but it can not be infinite .",
    "we thus write the weak field term as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the zero dc field broadening , depending only on @xmath56 .",
    "the shape of the curve is then of the form @xmath66 fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhmxb0 ] shows that this forms fits rather well the numerical simulation .",
    "unfortunately , we can not directly compared this result to experimental data as we do not have an independent measurement of the mean magnetic field across the atomic cloud .",
    "interestingly , one also finds that the minimum width does not correspond to @xmath67 ( perfect alignment of the magnetic field and the raman beam wavevector ) but to a small angle @xmath68 rad .",
    "for such an angle , light - shifts are slightly different for each zeeman sublevel , and so are the zeeman shifts .",
    "we attribute the minimum to a partial compensation of the two effects",
    ". however , this misaligned configuration tends to produce slightly asymmetric spectra .",
    "concluding this section , we can say that we have provided a convincingly interpretation of the physical mechanisms governing the width of the raman lines .",
    "the interpretation has been tested by comparing numerically generated spectra to the experimental results , which allowed us to quantify the performances of our setup .",
    "moreover , this interpretation furnishes some interesting hints for the minimization of the width of the collapsed spectra .",
    "another interesting hint is to polarize the atoms in one of the extreme ( @xmath69 ) zeeman sublevels by optical pumping .",
    "this shall sensibly reduce the broadening due to fluctuations of the light - shift .",
    "based on the measurements we have done in the split spectrum configuration , we expect in this case a collapsed linewidth of the order of 1 khz .",
    "we presented in this paper an experimental setup for subrecoil stimulated raman spectroscopy .",
    "a key feature of the setup is the active compensation of magnetic fields over a small volume .",
    "sensitive raman stimulated transitions on cesium have been used to characterize the setup , with residual magnetic field fluctuations of @xmath70 mg .",
    "the final limit of the method has been shown to be related to light - shift fluctuations rather than to the magnetic field ones .",
    "the residual linewidth is 4 khz , provided a small non - zero dc field is kept , allowing atomic velocity selection below @xmath71 with the present method .",
    "carefully constructed raman @xmath19-pulses , would allow to reduce the light power , pushing the resolution on the atomic velocity selection to the @xmath72 level , which would be comparable to the results obtained with double mu - metal shielding @xcite .    laboratoire de physique des lasers , atomes et molcules ( phlam ) is umr 8523 du cnrs et de luniversit des sciences et technologies de lille .",
    "centre detudes et recherches lasers et applications ( cerla ) is supported by ministre de la recherche , rgion nord - pas de calais and fonds europen de dveloppement economique des rgions ( feder ) .",
    "the geometry and definitions used in this appendix are those of fig . [",
    "fig : geometry ] , explained in the preceding section .",
    "we choose the quantization axis parallel to the magnetic field and decompose the polarizations of the raman beams in irreducible components ( noted @xmath73 ) with respect to that axis @xcite        the light - shift of the sublevel @xmath49 induced by the beam labeled @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is proportional to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the electron charge , @xmath81 the electric field associated to the @xmath77 raman beam , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the irreducible @xmath84-component of the position vector , and @xmath85 correspond to the zeeman sublevels of the excited state ( @xmath86 if @xmath25 and @xmath87 if @xmath17 ) , and @xmath88 is the optical detuning . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider that the optical detuning is high enough so that the above value can be considered to be independent of the sublevel ( practically , this means that the optical detuning must be much larger than 250 mhz ) . applying the wigner - eckart theorem",
