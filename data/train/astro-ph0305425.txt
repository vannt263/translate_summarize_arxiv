    "measuring stellar oscillations is a beautiful physics experiment .",
    "a star is a gaseous sphere and will oscillate in many different modes when suitably excited .",
    "the frequencies of these oscillations depend on the density , temperature , gas motion and other properties of the stellar interior .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations are determined by the excitation and damping processes , which may involve turbulence from convection , opacity variations and magnetic fields .",
    "studying the frequencies and amplitudes of oscillations in different types of stars promises to lead to significant advances in our understanding of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the best targets are stars which oscillate in several modes simultaneously .",
    "the frequency of each mode depends on the mode structure ( e.g. , the number of nodes ) and on spatial variations of the sound speed and buoyancy frequency within the star .",
    "the frequency spectrum therefore places strong constraints on the internal structure .",
    "this analysis , called asteroseismology , yields information about composition , age , mixing and internal rotation that can not be obtained in any other way and is completely analogous to the seismological study of the interior of the earth . for reviews , see @xcite and @xcite , and the proceedings of recent conferences @xcite .",
    "the best - studied example of an oscillating star is the sun .",
    "it oscillates in many modes simultaneously , with periods in the range 315 minutes .",
    "the frequencies of the modes contain information about the sound speed and rotation deep within the sun , with each mode sensing these quantities in subtly different ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very accurate measurements of the frequencies have allowed inversion to determine the internal structure and rotation of the sun .",
    "helioseismology has provided tests of theoretical models of solar evolution and led to fascinating new insights into the complex dynamics of solar internal rotation .",
    "observations that do not resolve the solar disk restrict us to observing modes of the lowest degree , but these still contain a great deal of information .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the sun observed in integrated light is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.virgo ] .",
    "the solar oscillations are excited by convection near the surface , and it is therefore to be expected that all stars having such a convection zone will show similar oscillations .",
    "we use the term _ solar - like oscillations _ to refer to oscillations excited stochastically by convection .",
    "this presumably includes all stars cool enough to have an outer convection zone , from roughly the cool edge of the classical instability strip out to the red giants .",
    "however , at least in stars of roughly solar type , the expected amplitudes are tiny , which places extreme demands on instrumental stability . in recent years , however , success has finally come . in this review",
    "we will describe the main results that have been achieved so far and make some comments about future prospects .",
    "solar - like oscillations are standing sound waves , known as p  modes ( since pressure is the restoring force ) . each mode",
    "is characterised by three integers : the radial order  @xmath0 , the angular degree  @xmath1 and the azimuthal degree  @xmath2 .",
    "mode frequencies for low - degree p - mode oscillations are approximated reasonably well by the asymptotic relation : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 ( the so - called large separation ) reflects the average stellar density , @xmath5 is sensitive to the sound speed near the core and @xmath6 is sensitive to the surface layers .",
    "it is conventional to define @xmath7 , the so - called small separation , as the frequency spacing between adjacent modes with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these separations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.schemspec ] , together with the similar quantity  @xmath10 .",
    "we can further define @xmath11 to be the amount by which @xmath12 modes are offset from the midpoint between the @xmath8 modes on either side ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.schemspec ] ) .",
    "if the asymptotic relation holds exactly , then it follows that @xmath13 .        in practice ,",
    "the asymptotic relation does not hold exactly , even for the sun .",
    "for example , the large separation depends on  @xmath1 ( hence the separate definitions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in fig .  [ fig.schemspec ] ) .",
    "the large and small separations also depend on frequency .",
    "therefore , a first asteroseismic analysis might involve comparing @xmath4 and @xmath7 with models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a full analysis will include a detailed comparison of individual frequencies .",
    "significant departures from the asymptotic relation are expected for evolved stars . as discussed by @xcite , the steep maximum in the local buoyancy frequency at the edge of the inert helium core",
    "gives rise to modes behaving like trapped internal gravity waves ( so - called g  modes ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the core contracts as the star evolves , leading to an increase in the buoyancy frequency and hence in the frequencies of the g  modes .",
    "meanwhile , the p - mode frequencies decrease with time as the mean density decreases .",
    "when the frequency of a g  mode approaches that of a p  mode , the two modes undergo an avoided crossing ( also called mode bumping ) where they exchange physical nature .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig - crossings ] , which shows frequency as a function of @xmath16 for an evolving @xmath17 star .",
    "radial modes ( @xmath18 ) , shown by dashed lines , closely follow equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) ; the decrease in frequency with age reflects the increasing stellar radius .",
    "the same trend is seen for modes with @xmath19 ( solid lines ) , but here we also see the effect of the additional set of g  modes , whose frequencies increase with age . at the avoided crossings the modes",
    "take on mixed characters between pure  p and pure g  modes .",
    "the frequencies of these mixed modes are extremely sensitive to the evolutionary state and are therefore very interesting , provided they are excited to observable amplitudes .",
    "observational evidence for mixed modes , in the form of frequencies departing from the asymptotic relation , has been seen in subgiants such as and .",
    "evolution of adiabatic frequencies with age of a model of mass @xmath20 , where age is measured by the effective temperature .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to modes of degree @xmath21 , and the solid lines to @xmath19 .",
    "the vertical solid line indicates the @xmath16 of .",
    "figure taken from @xcite . ]",
    "we also note that stellar rotation causes modes with @xmath22 to split into multiplets with different values of  @xmath2 , with a separation that directly measures the rotation rate averaged over the region of the star that is sampled by the mode . for the sun",
    ", these types of measurements have given important information about the internal rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and it is hoped that similar results will soon be achieved on other stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the measurements are particularly difficult because they require long time series , in order to resolve the rotational splittings .",
    "oscillations in the sun are long - lived compared to their periods , which allows their frequencies to be measured very precisely . however , the lifetime is finite and this results in the peaks in the power spectrum having a lorentzian profile with a linewidth that indicates the mode lifetime @xcite .",
    "mode lifetimes have not yet been directly measured for other solar - type stars , and a concern remains that some stars may have mode lifetimes so short that rotational splittings  and perhaps even the small and large separations  will not be observable . in the case of red giants",
    ", on the other hand , it appears that mode lifetimes have been measured ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.semireg ] ) .",
    "stellar oscillations have been observed by their effect on the stellar atmosphere in three ways ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( i )  velocity shifts of spectral lines ,",
    "( ii )  variations in total intensity ( photometry ) and ( iii )  variations in equivalent widths of temperature - sensitive lines . in all cases ,",
    "coverage of the target needs to be as continuous as possible to reduce confusion from aliases in the spectral window .",
    "most of the new results are based on velocity measurements obtained using high - dispersion spectrographs with stable reference sources .",
    "the dramatic improvement in doppler precision over recent years is a direct result of programs to detect planets around other stars .",
    "asteroseismology has benefited tremendously from these advances . indeed ,",
    "in one sense it is easier to measure oscillations because the timescales of interest are much shorter than for exoplanets . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitudes of oscillations in solar - type stars are extremely small , which is the reason that positive detections have been so difficult .",
    "intensity measurements have three tremendous advantages : they can be made with extremely simple instrumentation ; they use photons across a wide range of wavelengths ; and they can be made simultaneously on many stars ( although to some extent , multi - object spectroscopy also offers this possibility ) .",
    "unfortunately , scintillation from the earth s atmosphere severely limits the precision of ground - based photometry .",
    "the best results to date were obtained by @xcite in a multi - site campaign using differential photometry of the open cluster  m67 , but these fell short of providing definite detections .",
    "atmospheric scintillation on the antarctic plateau may be small enough to make high - precision photometry feasible @xcite , and there are plans to establish an observatory at dome  c @xcite .",
    "the chance for many weeks  or even months  of continuous observations represent an additional bonus .",
    "space is the ideal place to make intensity measurements , given the absence of atmospheric scintillation and the possibility for long periods of uninterrupted observations .",
    "the fine guidance sensors on the hubble space telescope were exploited by @xcite to perform high - precision photometry , as was the 52-mm star camera on the failed _ wire _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the space missions designed specifically for asteroseismology are _ most _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* launch date june 2003 ) , _ corot _ @xcite and _ eddington _ @xcite .",
    "it is unfortunate that _ mons _",
    "@xcite appears unlikely to proceed , due to lack of funding .",
    "this method for detecting oscillations was suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "it involves monitoring changes in spectral lines whose equivalent widths ( ews ) are temperature - sensitive , most notably the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "observations of showed good evidence for oscillations ( see sec .  [ sec.eboo ] ) , while those of only produced a tentative detection @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the usefulness of the balmer lines for measuring oscillations was questioned by @xcite .",
    "they cited the study by @xcite of the wavelength variation of oscillations in the sun , which showed that the balmer lines remain stable while the surrounding continuum fluctuates .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the effect that makes balmer - line ews so useful ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "velocity and ew measurements have an important advantage : they are both more sensitive to modes with @xmath23 than are intensity measurements . in both cases ,",
    "the reason is that the observations have some spatial resolution of the stellar disk , and so the tendency for high - degree modes to cancel is reduced . for velocity measurements ,",
    "we measure velocities projected onto the line of sight , which gives more sensitivity to the centre of the disk relative to the limb @xcite . for ew measurements , at least for the balmer lines , the centre - to - limb variation of line strengths gives a similar effect @xcite . as pointed out by these last authors , the different sensitivities to  @xmath1 of the various methods provides a useful tool for mode identification , and this has been applied to @xmath24  scuti stars @xcite .",
    "intensity and ew measurements both detect temperature changes , and so are much more sensitive to the stellar background that arises from granulation .",
    "this is seen in intensity observations of the sun ( fig .",
    "[ fig.virgo ] ) as background power rising towards low frequencies , and has been detected in ew observations of @xcite .",
    "although this power contains information about stellar convection that might usefully be compared with models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for asteroseismology it represents an unwanted and fundamental noise source .",
    "velocity observations are far less sensitive to the stellar background , which is a very important advantage .    finally , we note one disadvantage of velocity measurements over the other methods : the precision is degraded by stellar rotation , due to line broadening . of the stars discussed here ,",
    "only is rotating rapidly enough for this effect to be significant .    at this stage",
    ", it seems clear that measuring velocities is the method of choice for ground - based observations .",
    "however , the observations require high - resolution spectroscopy with extremely high precision , which is only achievable on a handful of instruments .",
    "ew measurements may have a place in observing rapid rotators , for which velocity measurements become less precise .",
    "intensity measurements are planned for space missions , and also for observations from antarctica .",
    "of course , photometry will also continue to be the main method of observing high - amplitude oscillators such as semiregulars ( sec .",
    "[ sec.semireg ] ) .",
    "early attempts to measure solar - like oscillations , including some claims for detections , have been reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent reviews appear in conference proceedings and these can be used to follow the development of the field @xcite . here",
    "we discuss results on some individual stars , with emphasis on the most recent results .",
    "the positions in the h - r diagram of most of these stars are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.hr ] .",
    "most of the observations discussed here were made in velocity .",
    "the exceptions are the ew observations of and the photometric observations of and of the red giants ( , and the semiregulars ) .",
    "h - r diagram showing some of the stars discussed in the text . ]",
    "this review deals mostly with observational aspects , although papers describing theoretical models of individual stars are noted in the relevant sections .",
    "there are several reviews in conference proceedings of the theoretical aspects of asteroseismology of solar - like stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we refer the reader to the comprehensive modelling of oscillation frequencies for intermediate - mass stars by @xcite .",
    "procyon is an f5 subgiant and the second brightest star of near - solar type ( the brightest is @xmath25  cen ) .",
    "evidence for oscillations in procyon was presented by @xcite , in the form of a broad envelope of excess power in the fourier spectrum .",
    "we have previously argued @xcite that this power excess could be due to noise , either from instrumental drift or from stellar background . since then , additional measurements with the foe and afoe spectrographs have continued to show the power excess @xcite , although without revealing the characteristic regular series of peaks .",
    "meanwhile , measurements with the elodie spectrograph by ( * ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , gave clear confirmation of the power excess and also provided evidence for a regular spacing of @xmath26 .",
    "the power excess has also been seen using the emilie and coralie spectrographs @xcite and it now seems clear that it has a stellar origin , although the signature of p - mode oscillations has not been confirmed .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the difficulty in obtaining a power spectrum of procyon that shows a clear p - mode structure is due to insufficient high - quality data ( i.e. , confusion from aliases in the spectral window ) or to intrinsic properties of the star ( i.e. , short mode lifetimes ) . finally , we note that several recent papers present theoretical models for procyon which are consistent with the above - mentioned value of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "[ [ sec.eboo ] ]    @xcite reported evidence for oscillations in the g0 sub - giant @xmath27  boo , based on measurements of balmer - line ews .",
    "the observed frequencies , taken with available estimates of the stellar parameters , were in good agreement with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting was the occurrence in theoretical models  and apparently in the observations  of avoided crossings , in which mode frequencies were shifted from their usual regular spacing by effects of gravity modes in the stellar core ( see sec .  [ sec.properties ] ) . meanwhile , a search for velocity oscillations in with the afoe spectrograph by @xcite failed to detect a signal , setting limits at a level below the value expected on the basis of the ew results .",

    "@xcite presented further observations of , obtained in 1998 in both ew and velocity .",
    "they recorded spectra with the nordic optical telescope , which they used to measure equivalent widths of strong temperature - sensitive lines .",
    "they also measured velocities using an iodine reference cell at lick observatory .",
    "their analysis also included velocity measurements published by @xcite and the original equivalent - width measurements by @xcite .",
    "all four data sets showed power excesses consistent with oscillations , although with a range of amplitudes that presumably reflects the stochastic nature of the excitation .",
    "the highest peaks showed regularity with a large separation of @xmath29 and they identified 21 oscillation frequencies from the combined data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.eboo-echelle ] ) .",
    "the observations indicate that peak oscillation amplitudes in are typically 35 times solar .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the upper limits reported by @xcite .",

    "we can conclude that oscillations in have been clearly detected and that individual mode frequencies have been identified .",
    "the frequencies have been compared with theory by @xcite , who were able to reproduce them using models both with and without convective - core overshooting .",
    "future observations of , particularly with the _ most _ spacecraft , should measure more oscillation modes with greater frequency precision and permit discrimination between these alternatives .",
    "a clear power excess in this southern g2 subgiant was detected using velocity measurements with ucles at the anglo - australian telescope by @xcite and confirmed with coralie by @xcite . although the amplitudes of the highest peaks were in agreement with theoretical expectations , @xcite has since pointed out that the total observed power was a factor of about 1.9 below expectations . in another development ,",
    "@xcite found evidence in the ucles data for a short - lived , high - amplitude oscillation event .",
    "such events have not been seen in the sun and , if confirmed as a feature of subgiants , these ` starquakes ' would make it harder to measure accurate mode frequencies and perform asteroseismology .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "meanwhile , theoretical calculations of frequencies for have been carried out by @xcite and by @xcite , both of which indicate the occurrence of avoided crossings for modes with @xmath12 .",
