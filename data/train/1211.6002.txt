    "the potential of electromagnetic probes ( real and virtual photons ) to characterize the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma is well known since it was first pointed out by shuryak @xcite .",
    "they are unique in providing information about the plasma temperature , the in - medium properties of hadrons and the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "the phenix detector was designed with special emphasis on the measurement of such probes @xcite and has produced the first rhic results on dileptons @xcite and direct photons @xcite .",
    "capitalizing on the flexibility of the rhic facility , phenix is engaged in a systematic study of electromagnetic probes . in these proceedings ,",
    "i present the most recent phenix results on these probes , including the nuclear modification factor r@xmath2 and the elliptic flow v@xmath3 of direct photons in au+au collisions , the measurement of direct photons in d+au collisions and the first results obtained with the hbd on the measurement of @xmath0 pairs in au+au collisions at @xmath1  =  200  gev .",
    "the r@xmath2 of direct photons up to p@xmath4 = 20 gev / c was first reported by the phenix experiment @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results showed an intriguing suppression trend at high p@xmath4 , above @xmath5 12 gev / c , albeit with very large statistical and systematic uncertainties , that triggered discussions about possible initial state and isospin effects @xcite . to qualitatively improve this result ,",
    "the r@xmath2 was recalculated using the statistically improved 2006 p+p data @xcite together with a reanalysis of the au+au data that combines the information of both the pbgl and pbsc calorimeters .",
    "the final results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa - photons ] show that r@xmath2 is consistent with 1 up to p@xmath4 = 20 gev / c and for all centralities expressed by the number of participant nucleons n@xmath6 @xcite thus resolving the long - standing issue of the behavior of the direct photons r@xmath2 at high p@xmath4 .",
    "phenix has measured direct photons in p+p and au+au collisions at @xmath1  =  200  gev@xcite . the p+p yield is well reproduced by nlo pqcd calculations down to p@xmath4 = 1 gev / c , whereas the au+au data exhibit a strong excess of photons ( in the p@xmath4 range of 1 - 3 gev / c ) beyond the p+p yield scaled by the number of binary collisions n@xmath7 .",
    "this excess has an exponential shape with a slope parameter t = 221 @xmath8 mev in central ( 0 - 20% ) collisions and has been interpreted as thermal radiation from the medium thus providing the first information about the temperature of the system averaged over the space - time evolution of the collision .",
    "using hydrodynamical models one can infer an initial temperature of t@xmath9 = 300 to 600 mev depending on the assumed formation time ( @xmath10 = 0.6 - 0.15 fm / c ) of the system .",
    "this is a seminal result . in order to further strengthen the interpretation in terms of thermal radiation , phenix measured the direct photons in d+au collisions to check whether the observed excess in au+au collisions could originate from cold nuclear matter effects in the initial state .",
    "the direct photons in d+au were measured via three independent methods : virtual photons , @xmath11 tagging and the statistical subtraction @xcite .",
    "all three methods yielded consistent results as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : photons - dau ] .",
    "the figure also demonstrates that the minimum bias ( mb ) d+au data are well reproduced by the fit to the p+p data scaled by n@xmath7 and that there is no excess of direct photons in the p@xmath4 range of 1 - 3 gev / c . the difference with the au+au system is better illustrated in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : photons - dau ] .",
    "the right upper panel demonstrates that the nuclear modification factor in d+au collisions is consistent with unity whereas the right lower panel shows a comparison of the r@xmath2 in au+au and d+au collisions .",
    "the large excess of direct photons observed in au+au at low p@xmath4 is not observed in d+au and one can then conclude that it is not due to initial state effects .",
    "this result reinforces the interpretation of the au+au excess as thermal radiation from the sqgp .",
    "phenix has measured the elliptic flow v@xmath3 of direct photons in au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and shape of v@xmath3 vs. p@xmath4 are very similar to those measured for pions .",
    "a large v@xmath3 is observed at p@xmath4 @xmath12 4 gev / c where the yield is dominated by thermal photons , whereas at higher p@xmath4 , where the yield is dominated by prompt photons , v@xmath3 is consistent with 0 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2-photons ] ( open circles ) .",
    "this is a surprising result .",
    "thermal radiation implies early emission whereas a large v@xmath3 implies late emission .",
    "no wonder therefore that models have difficulties in simultaneously reproducing the yield and the large v@xmath3 values of direct photons .",
    "the importance of this result prompted phenix to seek confirmation by performing a completely independent analysis with different systematic uncertainties based on external conversion photons .",
    "the new analysis allowed to extend the p@xmath4 range of the measurements down to 0.5 gev / c and yielded consistent results with the previous one in the p@xmath4 range of overlap as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : v2-photons ] .",
    "this provides an important confirmation of the unexpected large v@xmath3 values of low p@xmath4 direct photons in au+au collisions .",
    "phenix has performed the first measurements of the @xmath0 pair continuum in p+p @xcite and au+au collisions @xcite at @xmath1  =  200  gev .",
    "the p+p results are well reproduced by the cocktail of known sources whereas the au+au data show a strong enhancement at low masses m = 0.15 - 0.75 gev / c@xmath13 with respect to a similar cocktail adjusted to au+au collisions .",
    "the enhancement is concentrated at the most central 0 - 20% collisions and reaches a factor of @xmath14 for the 0 - 10% centrality bin and @xmath15 for mb collisions .    in spite of numerous attempts ,",
    "this result remains a challenge for theory .",
    "in particular , all models that successfully reproduced the low mass pair enhancement observed by the ceres and na60 experiments at the sps energies fail to reproduce the phenix result @xcite raising the speculation of a new , yet unidentified , source of dileptons .",
    "the phenix result is limited by large uncertainties , both statistical and systematic , due to the large combinatorial background and the resulting low signal to background ratio s / b and low cocktail to background ratio c / b .",
    "the latter represents an objective figure of merit for the sensitivity of the measurement to the known hadronic sources in the absence of any enhancement . for the mb data , the s / b ratio is @xmath51/200 and the c / b is @xmath51/1000 . in order to qualitatively improve the measurement of low - mass dileptons ,",
    "phenix embarked on an upgrade program .",
    "a hadron blind detector ( hbd ) was developed with the purpose to reduce the combinatorial background .",
    "the hbd is a windowless cherenkov detector operated with pure cf@xmath16 , in a proximity focus configuration .",
    "the detector consists of a 50  cm long radiator directly coupled to a triple gem detector which has a csi photocathode evaporated on the top face of the upper - most gem foil and pad readout at the bottom of the gem stack .",
    "the detector is located around the beam pipe in the field free region generated by operating the inner and outer coils of the phenix central arms in the @xmath17 configuration . in this mode",
    ", the inner coil counteracts the main field of the outer coil creating an almost field - free region close to the vertex , extending out to @xmath550 - 60 cm in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the hadron blindness property of the hbd is achieved by operating the detector in the so - called reverse bias mode . in this mode",
    ", the entrance mesh is set at a lower negative voltage with respect to the top gem and consequently the ionization electrons produced by a charged particle in the drift region between the mesh and the gem are mostly repelled towards the mesh @xcite .    the choice of cf@xmath16 as both the radiator and the detector gas in a windowless configuration results in an unprecedented large bandwidth extending from @xmath5110 nm given by the cf@xmath16 cut - off , up to @xmath5210 nm given by the threshold of csi .",
    "this large bandwidth translates into a large figure of merit n@xmath18 and a large number of photo - electrons per electron .",
    "the main task of the hbd is to recognize and reject tracks originating from @xmath19 conversions or @xmath11 dalitz decays , where only the @xmath20 or the @xmath21 is detected in the central arms .",
    "the strategy is to exploit the fact that the opening angle of electron pairs from these sources is very small compared to the pairs from light vector mesons . in the field - free region , this angle is preserved and the pairs produce two close or overlapping hits . therefore by applying an opening angle cut or a double amplitude cut one can reject a large fraction of the conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays , while keeping most of the signal .",
    "the detector was successfully operated in 2009 and 2010 and collected data in p+p and au+au collisions , respectively .",
    "the data analysis led to a measured value of n@xmath22330 @xmath23 by far higher than in any other existing gas cherenkov counter .",
    "this translates into 20 photo - electrons per single electron incident in the detector , allowing a good separation between single and double hits , a key requirement of the hbd to identify pairs from conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results shown below exhibit an improvement of the s / b of @xmath55 with respect to the previous measurements without the hbd .      for the p+p data analysis a procedure very similar to the one described in @xcite was used .",
    "significant changes were made for the au+au data analysis .",
    "in particular , two parallel and independent analysis streams were followed .",
    "the two streams yielded results that are in agreement within their uncertainties , thus providing a crucial consistency check .",
    "a full account of the two streams is far beyond the scope of these proceedings . only a few aspects and details of the analysis chain that yielded the best results in terms of signal efficiency are described here .    in this first pass through the data we chose to apply strong run qa and strong fiducial cuts .",
    "this has the benefit of homogenizing the response of the central arm detectors over time thereby reducing the number of corrections necessary to account for time variations of the various subsystems .",
    "on the other hand this approach involves a large price in statistics and pair reconstruction efficiency .",
    "cf@xmath16 has a strong scintillation line at 160 nm , right in the middle of the hbd sensitive bandwidth .",
    "this results in a large occupancy of the detector for central collisions that requires an underlying event subtraction before attempting to identify the electrons hits in the hbd .",
    "two different methods were used for this subtraction yielding consistent results .",
    "the hbd single electron detection efficiency achieved was @xmath2490% for the 40 - 60% centrality bin gradually decreasing to 65% for the most central bin of 0 - 10% while rejecting 90% of the fake tracks in both cases .",
    "the hbd provides strong electron identification capability in addition to the rich and emcal detectors of the central arms . instead of applying a series of independent one - dimensional cuts that ultimately result in a poor efficiency , we used a neural network for electron identification @xcite .",
    "the neural network was trained on samples of hijing events covering all centralities . a siginificant improvement of the global single electron track efficiency ( of @xmath5 50% for the peripheral 60 - 92% events and",
    "@xmath5 20% for the most central 0 - 10% events ) was obtained with the neural network as compared to the standard electron identification cuts .",
    "a neural network was also used to inspect the vicinity of electron hits and decide whether the hbd signal corresponds to a single or a double electron hit .",
    "the combinatorial background was subtracted in two separate steps .",
    "first the background resulting from the random combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the same event was subtracted using a mixed event technique .",
    "the normalization of the unlike mixed event backround is obtained by normalizing the like - sign mixed event spectrum to the like - sign foreground spectrum in a phase space region which is free from correlations ( mass @xmath24 0.55 gev / c@xmath13 to avoid cross pairs @xcite and opening angle @xmath12 120@xmath25 to avoid jet correlations ) .",
    "after this first step , the foreground unlike - sign spectrum contains both correlated background pairs and signal pairs and the foreground like - sign spectra contain only correlated background pairs . in the second step , the residual like - sign spectra , corrected for the acceptance difference between @xmath26 and @xmath17 pairs ,",
    "are subtracted from the residual unlike - sign spectrum to obtain the raw signal yield @xcite .",
    "this approach is relatively simple but results in a factor of @xmath27 larger statistical error as opposed to the case in which the various background sources are determined a priori and subtracted one after the other , without relying on the measured like - sign spectra .",
    "the raw signal is then corrected for acceptance and reconstruction efficiency to yield the invariant dilepton mass spectrum within the ideal acceptance of the phenix detector .",
    "conservative systematic errors were assigned to the various steps of the analysis and in particular to the combinatorial background subtraction .",
    "the au+au data were analyzed in the same five centrality bins as in the previoulsy published phenix dilepton results @xcite . in these proceedings",
    "we are presenting the results for peripheral ( 60 - 92% ) , semi - peripheral ( 40 - 60% ) and semi - central ( 20 - 40% ) events . results from the two most central bins ( 0 - 10% and 10 - 20% ) are not yet available .      the results are compared to a cocktail containing all the known hadronic sources . the exodus event generator @xcite is used to simulate the photonic sources ( dalitz decays of light neutral mesons : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and the non - photonic sources ( di - electron decays of the light vector mesons : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the correlated pairs from semi - leptonic decays of heavy flavor ( charm and bottom ) mesons are generated using the mc@nlo package @xcite which calculates the initial hard scattering at the next to leading order .",
    "after generating the various sources , the cocktail is filtered through the ideal acceptance of the phenix detector and smeared with the detector resolution .",
    "@xmath28 is the dominant electron source and also the fundamental input for exodus . for each centrality bin",
    ", we use @xmath11 p@xmath4 spectra based on phenix measurements of neutral and charged pions . for other mesons , the shape of the p@xmath4 distribution",
    "is obtained assuming m@xmath4 scaling .",
    "the absolute normalization is provided by the meson to @xmath11 ratio at high p@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the j/@xmath36 line shape for the p+p cocktail is obtained from a full monte carlo simulation where j/@xmath36 decays into @xmath0 are propagated through the full chain of reconstruction and analysis cuts using a geant based simulation of the phenix detector . for the j/@xmath36 in au+au ,",
    "the shape and yield are taken from the p+p measurement , the latter being scaled by n@xmath7 and the measured nuclear modification factor r@xmath2 @xcite . therefore the comparison cocktail vs data for the j/@xmath36 in au+au is reduced to a consistency check between the previously published and the present j/@xmath36 yields , without and with hbd , respectively .      figure [ fig : mass - spectrum - pp ] shows the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath0 pairs within the phenix detector acceptance measured in the 2009 p+p run with the hbd .",
    "the results are compared to the expected yield from the cocktail of known sources .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratio of data to cocktail and demonstrates a good understanding of the measured spectrum .",
    "the present result is fully consistent with the previously published one without the hbd @xcite and provides a crucial proof of principle for usage of the hbd .",
    "this analysis is now being repeated using all the tools of the new analysis chain developed for the au+au data analysis in order to fully assess the benefit of these tools .",
    "18 cm     figure [ fig : mass - spectra - auau ] shows the invariant mass spectra of @xmath0 pairs within the phenix detector acceptance measured in au+au collisions in the 2010 run with the hbd , in three centrality bins : 60 - 92% ( left panel ) , 40 - 60% ( middle panel ) and 20 - 40% ( right panel ) .",
    "the results are compared to the expected yield from the cocktail of known sources , briefly described in the previous section .",
    "the bottom panels show the ratio of data to cocktail . in the most peripheral bin",
    "the measured spectrum is in quite good agreement with the expected yield . for semi - peripheral and semi - central events",
    "there seems to be a small enhancement of the measured yield with respect to the cocktail that increases with centrality , both in the low - mass region ( lmr , m = 0.15 - 0.75 gev / c@xmath13 ) and the intermediate mass region ( imr , m = 1.2 - 2.8 gev / c@xmath13 ) .",
    "however , no clear statement can be made at this stage with the present level of very conservative errors .",
