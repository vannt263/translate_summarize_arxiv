    "biological membranes and synthetic polymer - membranes show a variety of shapes such as spherical , tubular , discoid , cylindrical , and many others including starfish @xcite .",
    "the shape of membranes is partly understood numerically with a surface model called a minimal model @xcite and also with the area difference bilayer model @xcite .",
    "external forces such as gravity and flow fields make the surface shape change @xcite .",
    "the surface shape can also be influenced by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the membrane shape should be understood as an equilibrium statistical mechanical phenomenon , although the shape of membranes seems to have a non - equilibrium nature .",
    "we should remind ourselves that the shape transformation and the surface fluctuation are two different phenomena , where the surface fluctuation phenomena have been extensively studied statistical mechanically @xcite .",
    "the surface fluctuation transition is accompanied by the collapsing transition in artificial membranes @xcite and in the surface model @xcite of helfrich @xcite , polyakov @xcite , and kleinert @xcite .",
    "this also indicates that the shape of membranes should be understood within the context of the theory of phase transitions .",
    "in fact , shape transformations , such as the prolate - oblate transition driven by the thermal fluctuation , were experimentally observed @xcite . current understanding of the effects of thermal fluctuations on the conformation and the elastic properties of membranes are reviewed in @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that the shape of a compartmentalized fluid surface model changes due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the results suggest that possible origins for the variety of membrane shapes are the cytoskeletal structure and the fluidity of lipids in membranes .",
    "moreover , it was also suggested in @xcite that the large variety of shapes can be understood in the framework of a surface model which has a cytoskeleton .",
    "the cytoskeletal structure has been considered as a key notion for understanding physics of membranes @xcite .    in this article , in order to make this observation more convincing we study another compartmentalized fluid surface model , which is almost identical to the model in @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that a small change in the model makes a large difference in the multitude of surface shapes .",
    "the only difference between the model in this article and that of ref.@xcite is in the junction elasticity ; rigid plates are assumed as the junctions in @xcite while neither two - dimensional elasticity nor rigid plate is assumed in the model of this article . both of the compartmentalized models are inhomogeneous because of the cytoskeletal structures ; the surface strength on the compartment boundary is different from that inside the compartments , and moreover the diffusion of vertices is confined only in the compartments .",
    "the compartmentalized structure is a sublattice on a triangulated surface , which is constructed from the icosahedron . by dividing the edges of the icosahedron into @xmath0 pieces",
