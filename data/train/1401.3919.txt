    "galaxies are distributed inhomogeneously on small scales in the universe and thus define large - scale structures which consist of dense regions of galaxies such as galaxy clusters , sparse regions called voids , and filamentary structures which connect the dense regions , as revealed by large spectroscopic surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy clusters embedded in the large - scale structures are some of the densest systems in the universe and occur at intersections of the galaxy filaments . while the spatial distribution of galaxies has been revealed in detail in the local universe , the process by which the galaxy clusters form is yet to be understood in detail .",
    "galaxy clusters are considered to originate from the clustering of some young galaxies ( i.e. , proto - cluster ) in the early universe and to gradually grow into more massive gravitationally bound systems with time while accreting galaxies from the surrounding regions .",
    "the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario can reproduce well the picture seen in the universe within the framework of the hierarchical formation of galaxy structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observational studies through wide - field imaging surveys of distant clusters at @xmath3 have also supported the hierarchical formation by finding large - scale structures around galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one interesting finding suggested by such observational studies is that cluster galaxies seem to follow an inside - out evolution in the sense that the environment where galaxies are active shifts from the densest regions at high redshifts ( @xmath5 23 ) towards less dense regions at lower redshifts ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "star forming activity increases rapidly in the denser regions and becomes comparable to the surrounding lower density regions at higher redshifts , which implies that galaxy formation is biased towards higher density regions at high redshift ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is also known that the environmental dependences of galaxy properties seen at @xmath7 are already in place at @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the next step to understand the evolution of cluster galaxies is to determine precisely how galaxies change their properties as a result of the hierarchical growth of large - scale structures",
    "however , the difficulty is the need for accurate determination of the redshift to determine the precise environment of the galaxies .",
    "although photometric redshifts estimated by fitting template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to the multi - wavelength photometry of galaxies is quite effective , the uncertainty becomes large at higher redshifts .",

    "an effective way to solve the issue is by carrying out the imaging with narrowband filters targeting nebular emission from hii regions of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the narrowband imaging enables a largely unbiased sampling of star - forming galaxies down to a limiting star - formation rate of galaxy and the redshift of galaxies selected are determined with the accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "however , this is too uncertain to accurately define the environment of galaxies as this redshift range corresponds to a co - moving depth of @xmath11 56 mpc at @xmath0 .",
    "we thus demonstrate a novel technique to circumvent this problem .",
    "the galaxy cluster xmmxcs  j2215.9 - 1738 ( hereafter xcs2215 ) at @xmath0 is one of the most distant massive clusters known @xcite .",
    "extended x - ray emission from hot gas bound in the cluster suggests that it is already a mature system .",
    "however , previous studies have revealed that this galaxy cluster is still growing actively @xcite .",
    "we discovered a high fraction of galaxies undergoing active star formation in the core of the cluster and the existence of large scale structures of star - forming galaxies around the cluster .",
    "the finding means that this galaxy cluster is a good target to investigate the processes operating on galaxies assembling into the centre of the cluster from the outskirts . however , our current understanding is based on a view of the large scale structures projected on the celestial plane .",
    "we require to know the true three dimensional structures to reveal in detail the processes playing a critical role in formation of characteristic properties of cluster galaxies , because the projected distribution of galaxies may not reflect the real structures .",
    "the results found without the three dimensional structures can be led to wrong conclusions .",

    "these data were useful for showing the validity of our selection of nb912 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "however , the spectroscopic confirmation was limited to [ oii ]  emitters in the core region .",
    "we have used the fiber multi object spectrograph ( fmos ) on the subaru telescope to confirm the large scale structure of [ oii ]  emitters we have discovered in @xcite .",
    "it allows for multi - object spectroscopy in the @xmath13 and @xmath35-bands with 400 fibers and a wide fov of 30 arcmin .",

    "unfortunately , due to the instrumental trouble , only the irs2 , i.e. , one of the two spectrographs in fmos , was available in our observation run .",
    "therefore , only 50% of sources were targeted , resulting in sparse sampling of the targets .",
    "targets are mainly selected from the sample of nb912 [ oii ]  emitters shown in @xcite .",
    "we targetted 78 galaxies in total , of which 56 are nb912 [ oii ]  emitters . in this run",
    ", we used the high resolution h - long setting which covers the wavelength of 1.61.8  with a spectral resolution of r=2000 , enough to resolve h@xmath12  and [ nii ]  emission lines , where present .",
    "we adopted the cross beam switching method , that is , half of the fibers available are allocated to the targets and at the same time the other half of them observe nearby regions of blank sky .",
    "the total integration time was 5.5 hours .",
    "observations were conducted in photometric conditions .",
    "the seeing was 0.70.9 arcsec in @xmath45-band , which was measured for the coordinate calibration stars ( so - called ccs stars in the fmos spine - to - object allocation software ) near the centre of the fov , implying that loss of flux escaping from the 1.2-arcsec diameter fibre should be small for unresolved objects .",
    "we had another opportunity to observe the [ oii ]  emitters with fmos for about two hours on 2013 october 13 ( s13b-106 , pi : k .- i .",
    "the targets are selected from the samples of nb912 [ oii ]  emitters and nb921 [ oii ]  emitters described below .",
    "the same setup as for the previous observation was used in this run . however , only one spectrograph ( irs1 ) was available again .",
    "the total integration time was 1.5 hours on source . during the observations , the sky was almost clear and the seeing was @xmath111.0 arcsec .",
    "spectra were obtained for 65 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "we used the fibre - pac data reduction package @xcite to reduce the fmos data .",
    "fibre - pac corrects the flux for the loss from the fiber which is estimated using a calibration star .",
    "although further correction may be required for extended sources like galaxies @xcite , the redshift and ratio of emission line fluxes can be measured reliably even if the correction is not performed .",
    "we fitted three gaussians to the spectra to measure h@xmath12and the [ nii ]  doublet and estimated the signal - to - noise ratio of emission lines seen in the spectra , and the redshift . in the gaussian",
    "fitting , the width of the two gaussians fitted to the [ nii ]  doublet is fixed to the same value as h@xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the flux ratio of [ nii]doublet is fixed to one - third .",
    "errors on the emission line fluxes are estimated using the standard deviation of 500 measurements of the flux , where in each measurement a set of three gaussians is fitted to the spectrum to which the error with normal distribution with 1@xmath34 spectral noise is added .",
    "we regard h@xmath12  emission with flux greater than 3@xmath34 as a detection , and then check the spectra judged to have a line detection , by visual inspection .",
    "we succeed in spectroscopically confirming 48 sources by detecting h@xmath12  emission at more than 3@xmath34 in the whole region we surveyed , among which the number of the [ oii ]  emitters is 41 .",
    "even if only a single emission line is detected in the spectrum , it can be identified as being h@xmath12 , because we have already detected [ oii]emission with our narrowband imaging .",
    "the fmos spectra demonstrate that our selection of nb912 and nb921 [ oii ]  emitters is valid and that the structure we have found around the cluster is real .",
    "we also have additional spectroscopic redshifts from the literature . @xcite",
    "have spectroscopically confirmed 44 member galaxies in this cluster .",
    "we cross - identify the galaxies confirmed by our subaru observations to the 44 member galaxies in @xcite , and seven galaxies turn out to be common objects .",
    "we checked that we do not find any disagreement in the redshifts of the common sources .",
    "therefore , 101 galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed to be associated with the structure in and around the galaxy cluster .",
    "the redshift distribution of the confirmed galaxies is shown in figure [ fig;nbfilters ] .",
    "in this section , we select emission line galaxies using the photometric catalogues .",
    "we have already published the sample of [ oii ]   emitters at @xmath1 based on the nb912 data @xcite .",
    "since there is only a slight difference between nb912 and nb921 in the central wavelength of response curve , we can apply the same method for the selection of nb921 [ oii ]  emitters as for nb912 [ oii ]  emitters summarised below .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for more details , if needed .",
    "first , we select galaxies with colour excess in @xmath40-nb921 at more than 3@xmath34 ( figure  [ fig;selection ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to galaxies with a line flux larger than 1.2@xmath3210@xmath46 erg s@xmath24 @xmath47 being selected .",
    "if the excess is due to the [ oii]emission line at @xmath0 , the limiting flux corresponds to a dust - free sfr of 2.2 m@xmath31  yr@xmath24 according to the [ oii]sfr calibration in @xcite where a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed . to exclude the possible contamination of galaxies due mainly to photometric errors , additional criterion for the observed equivalent width ( ew ) larger than 35  ( i.e. , 14  in the rest - frame for [ oii ]  at @xmath0 ) is applied . as a result",
    ", we select 1,135 nb921 emitters . among them , 789 emitters are detected in @xmath14 at more than 2@xmath34 level . in what follows ,",
    "we deal with the @xmath14-detected emitters , because we identify the [ oii ]  emitters based on their @xmath43 and @xmath44 colours @xcite . with the criteria , we select 429 nb921 [ oii ]  emitters in total ( figure  [ fig;selection ] ) .",
    "we note that the number of nb921 [ oii ]  emitters is slightly larger than that of nb912 [ oii ]  emitters even if the same limiting [ oii ]  flux is adopted between the two samples",
    ". however , the numbers of [ oii ]  emitters selected are in agreement within a 1 @xmath34 error based on poisson statistics .",
    "the small difference can appear because of the structures and clustering of galaxies at slightly different redshifts .",
    "we can use the nb@xmath25  and h images to select h@xmath12  emission line galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "again , galaxies with a colour excess in @xmath35nb@xmath25  are selected , and then the same colour selection ( @xmath48 ) is applied to identify h@xmath12  emitters among the 19 emission line candidates .",
    "the cut of 3@xmath34 colour excess corresponds to galaxies with a line flux larger than 1.4@xmath3210@xmath49 erg s@xmath24 @xmath47 being selected .",
    "if the excess is due to h@xmath12  at @xmath0 , the limiting flux corresponds to a dust - free sfr of 14.6 m@xmath31  yr@xmath24 according to @xcite .",
    "we also apply an observed ew cut larger than 50  ( i.e. , 20  in the rest - frame for h@xmath12  at @xmath0 ) . although @xcite made a small correction to @xmath35nb@xmath25colours using @xmath50 colours to estimate the continuum level in the broadband more accurately , we find that @xmath35nb@xmath25  colours are distributed around zero without any correction .",
    "thus , no further correction is applied for the colour term and the method used for the selection is similar to that applied for the selection of [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath1 . with their criteria , we select 9 h@xmath12  emitters in total ( figure  [ fig;selection ] )",
    "now , we have three samples of emission line galaxies at @xmath1 ; nb912 [ oii ]  emitters , nb921 [ oii ]  emitters , and nb@xmath25  h@xmath12  emitters .",
    "since they are all at similar redshifts , some emitters in the catalogues should overlap each other .",
    "first , we compare the catalogues between nb912 and nb921 [ oii ]  emitters by searching for galaxies for which the difference in the coordinates are within 0.5 arcsec . among 380 nb912 and 429 nb921 [ oii ]  emitters",
    ", it is found that 170 galaxies are common in both samples .",
    "we also find that four nb@xmath25  h@xmath12emitters are in the [ oii ]  emitter samples by using a circle with 1.0 arcsec radius to search for the common galaxies .",
    "moreover , cross - matching with the spectroscopic data described in   [ sec;specdata ] , we spectroscopically confirm 41 nb912+nb921 , 21 nb912 , 11 nb921 [ oii ]  emitters and two h@xmath12  emitters ( see also figure [ fig;nbfilters ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig;map ] shows a celestial distribution of nb912 or nb921 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we can confirm again the clustering of [ oii ]  emitters in the centre and the large - scale structure existing in the surrounding region which were already found in @xcite , even when the nb921 data are used .",
    "more importantly , it seems that there is a slight difference in the distribution between nb912 and nb921 [ oii ]  emitters , although about half of them overlap .",
    "the prominent filamentary structure that @xcite have discovered is likely to be slightly in the foreground , and the distribution of nb921 [ oii ]  emitters seems to be spread along the southwestern direction from the cluster centre . as shown in figure  [ fig;nbfilters ] , the nb912 and nb921 can detect galaxies with a difference in velocity by @xmath112000 km s@xmath24 .",

    "these observations demonstrate that revealing the three dimensional structure is crucial to improve our understanding , in particular in the early universe when galaxies are active and the structures are growing .",

    "the two histograms are not considered to be clearly different distributions , based on the k - s test , suggesting that the method we use to estimate the redshift is valid . ]",
    "the two narrowband filters of nb912 and nb921 on suprime - cam are very close to each other ( figure  [ fig;nbfilters ] ) .",
    "the overlap with a slight difference in the response curves allows us to estimate the redshift where the [ oii ]  emitters are located between @xmath51.421.49 , based on the difference of emission line fluxes measured in the nb912 and nb921 images .",
    "this is because the narrowband filters are not perfect top - hats .",
    "that is , the flux measured by narrowband imaging for a galaxy with a given luminosity is dependent on its wavelength .",
    "for example , if a star - forming galaxy is at @xmath261.44 , it should be detected as a nb912 emitter but not detected as a nb921 emitter .",
    "on the other hand , if a star - forming galaxy is at @xmath261.48 , it should be detected as a nb921 emitter but not detected as a nb912 emitter .",
    "more interesting are star - forming galaxies detected with both nb912 and nb921 images . if the ratio of line flux measured with nb912 to that with nb921 is greater than unity , the galaxy is expected to be at @xmath55 , while if the ratio is smaller than unity the galaxy is likely to be at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we can reveal the three - dimensional large scale structure in and around the xcs2215 galaxy cluster with these two filters .",
    "figure [ fig;fluxratio ] shows that the expected ratio of nb912 to nb921-measured line flux is a monotonically decreasing function of redshift between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( shown by the broken line ) , demonstrating that we can estimate the redshift from the flux ratio measured with the two narrowband filters .",
    "we then make sure of the validity of the method using the [ oii ]  emitters which have been spectroscopically confirmed . for nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters",
    ", it is clearly seen that the flux ratio is correlated with the spectroscopic redshift and the flux ratios measured are distributed around the values expected from the response function of the narrowband filters .",
    "however , a systematic difference between the actual line ratio and the expectation is seen when the redshift is far from @xmath1 .",
    "the discrepancy can be caused by inhomogeneity of response curve over the fov and/or the difference between the actual response curve when installed on the suprime - cam and the measurement in a laboratory , although it is unlikely that the response curve of the two filters have large inhomogeneity . to correct for those effects ,",
    "we fit a linear function to all of the data of nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters , and the fitted relation is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig;fluxratio ] .",
    "hereafter , we use this linear relation obtained from the fitting to estimate the redshift of [ oii ]  emitters . note that we removed the nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitter at @xmath59 from the fitting since the deviation from the others is large , but even if the emitter is included ,",
    "we make sure that the results shown below are not largely changed .",
    "the [ oii ]  emitters identified in only nb912 tend to have spectroscopic redshifts less than @xmath1 which corresponds to the redshift where the galaxy has the nb912/nb921 line ratio of unity , while those identified in only nb921 tend to have the redshift greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this is also what we expect .",
    "indeed , the blue(red ) open circles show the nb912(nb921 ) [ oii ]  emitters for which the expected nb921(nb912 ) [ oii ]  flux is smaller than the detection limit .",
    "this is the case for about a third of nb912 or nb921 [ oii]emitters .",
    "another third of [ oii ]  emitters seem to have [ oii]fluxes which in theory should be able to be detected in both narrowbands . however , the expected [ oii ]  fluxes in the non - detection narrowband are close to the detection limit .",
    "thus , the actual [ oii]flux may be smaller than the limit due to the uncertainty of [ oii]flux measured by the other narrowband .",
    "finally , the remaining third of [ oii ]  emitters should have a [ oii ]  flux which is easily detected in both narrowbands , and yet are absent in one narrowband . although the cause is unclear , the criteria of ew and significance of colour excess applied to select the emitters as well as the colour selection to identify the emission line can influence the detection of [ oii]emission .",
    "nevertheless , the redshift can be estimated from the line flux for about 70% of [ oii ]  emitters detected by nb912 or nb921 narrowband filters , which adequately allows us to trace the three dimensional structure .",
    "the redshift estimated from the line ratio measured by nb912 and nb921 filters , @xmath52 , is compared with the spectroscopic redshift , @xmath53 , for the nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "we then calculate the difference of the two redshifts and find that @xmath54 ( figure  [ fig;fluxratio ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the accuracy of the redshift , @xmath52 , is satisfactory , and despite only two narrowband datapoints being used , it is better than that of the photometric redshifts estimated from photometry with as many as 30-bands in the cosmos field ; @xmath60 at @xmath61 , @xmath62 at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 at @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite . thus , the line ratio measured with the adjacent narrowband filters can be a powerful estimator of redshift enabling us to map out well the three dimensional structure of star forming galaxies in the field surveyed without spectroscopy of _ all _ galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig;nzoii ] shows the distributions of the two redshift estimations ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the histograms seem to be similar to each other .",
    "indeed , the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that they are likely to show the same distribution and the probability of their being based on the same populations is more than 70% .",
    "thus , we conclude that we can use the line ratio to estimate the redshift of [ oii ]  emitters and then investigate their three dimensional distribution in and around the galaxy cluster quite accurately .",
    "cc            figure  [ fig;3d ] shows the three dimensional distribution of nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "although we have seen the filamentary structures in this field ( figure  [ fig;map ] and @xcite ) , the 3d view reveals that it is not an effect of projection but a real distribution and there are several new filamentary structures .",
    "it seems that some structures extend towards the centre of the galaxy cluster , and some intersect other structures .",
    "these structures can not be fully understood without seeing the 3d distribution of galaxies as well as the projected celestial distribution .",
    "galaxy clusters are considered to be formed at the intersection of filamentary structures and grow while assembling galaxies by the gravity of the system along the large - scale structures .",
    "the 3d structures we have found around the galaxy cluster is fully consistent with this picture .",
    "we should be witnessing the site where galaxies in the surrounding region are infalling towards the centre of galaxy cluster at @xmath68 when the vigorous evolution of galaxies occurred .",
    "since we use the redshift to draw the distribution of star - forming galaxies in three dimension , we should take care of the effect of peculiar motion which distorts that view .",
    "in particular , this effect could work significantly very near the cluster core and the structure in the redshift direction ( i.e. , depth ) could seem to shrink relative to what it is .",
    "however , there is no doubt of the existence of the large scale structure , since the filamentary structures tend to spread widely in the direction parallel to the celestial plane .",
    "figure  [ fig;3d ] resembles the structures seen in cosmological @xmath69-body simulations based on the cdm model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations predict the distribution of dark matter .",
    "however , the consistency between the cosmological simulation and the observations at @xmath68 confirms that the distribution of galaxies in the universe is governed by dark matter and grows hierarchically .",
    "in addition , the three dimensional structure of the galaxy cluster at @xmath0 provides us with an unique opportunity to investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the location of galaxies infalling into the cluster . at lower redshifts ,",

    "it is interesting to investigate what causes the change of the properties in the course of galaxies infalling along the filamentary structure .",
    "we discuss this point in   [ sec;env_dependent_properties ] .",
    "thanks to the unique set of narrowband filters , we can compare h@xmath12emission with [ oii ]  emission in an unbiased manner for galaxies associated with the structures at @xmath1 .",
    "similar comparisons have been conducted for emission line galaxies detected with dual narrowband filters in the field @xcite . before comparing them",

    "also , note that this h@xmath12  limit is much shallower than those in @xcite and/or @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig;map ] , for four out of nine h@xmath12  emitters , [ oii ]  emissions are detected by nb912 or nb921 imaging .",
    "all of them have [ oii ]  emission detected in nb921 data , but only one emitter has [ oii ]  emission detected in nb912 .",
    "this is likely due to the difference between the filter response curves in redshift space ( figure  [ fig;nbfilters ] ) .",
    "note that among the four , the h@xmath12  emitter with [ oii ]  emission detected in both nb912 and nb921 is spectroscopically confirmed , and the others are not confirmed yet .",
    "figure  [ fig;selection ] shows that the h@xmath12  emitters with [ oii ]  detections tend to have redder @xmath44 colour .",
    "this may go against our intuition .",
    "we expect that [ oii ]  emission is easier to detect in less dusty galaxies which should have bluer colour .",
    "the observations seem to suggest that the dust extinction does not determine mainly whether the [ oii ]  emission is detected or not for the h@xmath12  emitters . perhaps , it is related to the age , if the redder @xmath44 colour means stronger balmer/4000  break due to an older stellar population rather than heavier dust extinction .",
    "we check the ew of the emitters , but we do not find any significant difference between the [ oii ]  emitters with and without h@xmath12  detection ( see also figure [ fig;selection ] ) .",
    "the ratio of h@xmath12/[oii ]  is also dependent on metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the galaxies have lower metallicity , [ oii ]  luminosity should be higher and easier to be detected for galaxies with a given h@xmath12  luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , about half of h@xmath12  emitters do not have [ oii]emissions detected in nb912 or nb921 data .",
    "these galaxies may be metal - rich .",
    "the galaxies detected as a nb@xmath25  emitter could alternatively be [ oii]emitters at @xmath70 and/or [ oiii ]  emitters at @xmath71 .",
    "however , since the fluxes of the emission lines detected are greater than 1.4@xmath3210@xmath49 erg s@xmath24 @xmath47 , the corresponding luminosities are quite large if the galaxies are at @xmath72 .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that almost all of them are contaminants .    in comparison with the large numbers of [ oii ]",
    "emitters being detected , the number of h@xmath12  emitters detected is small . typically , [ oii]emitters at @xmath1 are a population with a lower amount of dust @xcite .",
    "less dusty galaxies have an observed ratio of h@xmath12  to [ oii ]  of @xmath73 , suggesting that h@xmath12  luminosity may not be strong for galaxies with a given [ oii ]  luminosity . indeed",
    ", there are only four [ oii ]  emitters with [ oii ]  fluxes larger than 1.4@xmath3210@xmath49 erg s@xmath24 @xmath47 in the region where nb@xmath25and @xmath35 data by wfcam are available .",
    "even if the limit is weakened down to 1.0@xmath3210@xmath49 erg s@xmath24 @xmath47 , the number of the [ oii ]  emitters is only 12 .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the number of the h@xmath12  emitters detected among the [ oii ]  emitter sample .",
    "this means that the ratio of h@xmath12  to [ oii ]   is not high but close to unity , which may support that most of the [ oii ]  emitters are typically less dusty .",
    "thus , a deeper survey of h@xmath12emission is required so that we can obtain a larger sample of h@xmath12emitters at @xmath68 .",
    "one of the hot topics in the evolution of cluster galaxies is how and where the galaxies obtained the properties characteristic of cluster galaxies seen in the local universe , with redder colour , less star formation activity , and bulge - dominated morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate how the properties of [ oii ]  emitters change along the filamentary large scale structures .",
    "figure  [ fig;3d_zkoii ] shows again the three dimensional distribution of the 170 [ oii ]  emitters identified by both narrowband filters , but now colour - coded by @xmath74 colour and [ oii ]  flux .",
    "note that the @xmath74 colour of galaxies at @xmath1 corresponds to the @xmath75 colour in rest - frame , implying that it is useful to estimate the strength of the balmer/4000  break .",
    "it seems that [ oii ]  emitters with red or green @xmath74 colour of @xmath76 are likely to be located along the filamentary structures and in the region close to the cluster centre , where the criterion of red or green colour is based on the distribution of @xmath74 colours shown in figure  [ fig;selection ] .",
    "the [ oii ]  emitters away from the cluster centre , and relatively isolated ones , seem to have bluer colours .",
    "if this is true , it can be considered that the galaxies have changed colour while they are in the filamentary structures and close to the centre of galaxy cluster . on the other hand , no strong dependence of [ oii ]  flux on the location of the galaxy",
    "is seen , although we might have expected that the star formation of galaxies weakens along the structures .",
    "we note that stellar mass of the galaxies also does not show a strong dependence .",
    "this indicates that there is no strong dependence of specific sfrs on the location of the galaxy , which is consistent with the result that @xcite have found for galaxy clusters at @xmath77 .",
    "although the result may be somewhat subjective , we discuss the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment more quantitatively below .",
    "the red colour of galaxies can be caused by two degenerate factors .",
    "one is the age of the galaxy and the other is dust .",
    "if we assume that the age mainly dominates the change of the colour , since [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath1 are likely to be typically less dusty populations @xcite , then the galaxies get older as they are in the filamentary structures and close to the centre of galaxy cluster .",
    "if we assume that dust extinction is a dominant cause of their red colors , this means that dusty starburst activity is preferentially triggered in the environments of filamentary structures and the centre of the galaxy cluster .",
    "this is very similar to our recent finding by @xcite , where we demonstrated that star - forming galaxies in dense environments tend to be more highly obscured by dust than normal field galaxies at the same redshifts .",
    "thus , in any case , our result suggests that galaxy evolution occurs along the large - scale filamentary structures around the galaxy cluster .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that galaxies in the surrounding region follow the scenario of hierarchical cluster formation as expected , galaxies are considered to evolve while infalling to the centre along the filamentary structures .",
    "a dependence of the star formation activity on the site where galaxies reside is not seen in this cluster .",
    "however , studies of galaxy clusters at lower redshifts suggest that galaxies in the core of rich clusters must stop their activity significantly before @xmath8 . thus , quenching process might be at work in the core region more effectively .",
    "@xcite have found an excess of [ oii ]   emitters with red colours comparable to galaxies on the red sequence of colour - magnitude diagram , and they are likely to be possible agns .",
    "it is argued that the agn feedback could play a role in quenching star formation of galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster .    , calculated from the three dimensional distribution with the surface local density , @xmath78 , in @xcite for the nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters .",
    "the solid line and open circles shows the median values in each bin , and the broken lines show the 25% and 75% values . ]         here , we calculate a local density from the three dimensional distribution ( figure  [ fig;3d ] ) to discuss the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment more quantitatively .",
    "we note that similar discussions were made in @xcite , but we can refine them with the three dimensional distribution of the galaxies . the local density , @xmath79 , in units of mpc@xmath80 ( in co - moving scale ) , is calculated using the volume out to which the fifth nearest [ oii ]  emitters are included .",
    "we then compare this with the local surface density , @xmath78 , in units of mpc@xmath81 ( in co - moving scale ) , calculated in @xcite .",
    "note that the nb912+nb921 [ oii ]  emitters are used in the calculation of @xmath79 , while all of the nb912 [ oii ]  emitters are used in the calculation of @xmath78 in @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig;fluxratio ] , many of the nb912 [ oii]emitters without a [ oii ]  detection in nb921 have redshifts lower than @xmath82 , that is , they tend to be embedded in structures slightly in the foreground compared with the galaxies associated with the cluster . thus , although the samples used are not identical , the comparison allows us to investigate the properties of galaxies in the cluster and the structures at @xmath1 .",
    "we also make sure that our results do not change even if the local densities are calculated from the third or seventh nearest emitters . in this work",
    ", we adopt the local densities calculated from the fifth nearest emitters to be consistent with @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig;comp_density ] shows the comparison between the two local densities .",
    "although the two densities are roughly in agreement , the correlation is not strong and there is a large dispersion between them .",
    "indeed , the correlation coefficient is 0.52 .",
    "the mild correlation between them underlines the importance of obtaining the true three dimensional distribution to properly estimate the environment where galaxies reside , instead of using a projected celestial distribution .",
    "however , as described in   [ sec;3ds ] , the peculiar motion of an individual galaxy can influence the local density estimated from the three dimensional distribution whose depth is based on the redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig;env_properties ] shows the @xmath74 colours and [ oii]fluxes as a function of local density , @xmath79 , where the fluxes are corrected for the response curve of the filter using the redshift estimated from the ratio of nb912 to nb921 flux .",
    "the correction to the flux varies by a factor of 1.00 to 8.83 , and the median is a factor of 1.06 .",
    "note that the precise correction is dependent on the redshift at which the galaxies are located ( figure  [ fig;nbfilters ] ) .",
    "our method using two adjacent narrowband filters demonstrates that we can measure both accurate fluxes of the emission lines and accurate redshifts . in both panels , the median , 25% and 75% values",
    "are also shown in each bin .",
    "the distribution of the colours and [ oii ]   fluxes in each panel is consistent with our earlier discussion .",
    "first , the average colour of galaxies mildly gets redder as the local density becomes larger , although the difference in colour is not large .",
    "moreover , almost all galaxies with red colours of @xmath83 , as defined in @xcite , tend to be located in higher density regions , while no such red galaxy is seen in the lower density regions .",
    "next , there is no strong dependence of [ oii ]  flux on the local density , suggesting that the sfrs of galaxies associated with this cluster and structures are not dependent on the environment .",
    "note that the [ oii ]  fluxes are not corrected for dust extinction .",
    "however , even if a dust correction dependent on sfr or stellar mass is adopted for the [ oii ]  emitters , the result does not change , as we do not observe a strong dependence of stellar masses of galaxies on the local density .",
    "we also investigate the star - formation activity in galaxies at a given stellar mass as a function of the local density .",
    "there is no strong dependence of star formation on environment in all bins of stellar mass .",
    "consequently , although we find that the surface local density is not an ideal indicator of the environment , the results we have found in this paper support those of @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that there is a weak correlation between the galaxy colour and the environment on average , despite other properties showing no environmental dependence .",
    "as discussed above , galaxy colours can relate to the age or dust extinction . in the former case ,",
    "it is likely that galaxies have experienced a similar , steady history of star formation in all environments , but galaxies formed earlier on average in denser environments .",
    "we may be witnessing the formation bias of cluster galaxies . in the latter case",
    ", it is also likely that star formation activity is underestimated and the dusty starburst might have something to do with the mode of star formation which is triggered by the environmental effects and thus different from that of field galaxies .",
    "it would be interesting to reveal which is the main factor to cause the environmental dependence of galaxy properties we have observed .",
    "however , such investigation is beyond the scope of this paper due to the limitations of the data .",
    "we have revealed large - scale structures around a galaxy cluster , xcs2215 , at @xmath0 for the first time in _ three dimensions _ by using a set of narrowband images targeting nebular emissions from the galaxies associated with the galaxy cluster .",
    "the uniqueness of this study is a combination of nb912 and nb921 narrowband filters installed in suprime - cam on the subaru telescope which is very effective to estimate the accurate redshifts of the star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "the two overlapping filters , with a slight difference in central wavelength corresponding to @xmath84 km s@xmath24 , cause a difference in measured flux depending on the wavelength where the emission line is observed in each filter .",
    "both narrowband filters can detect [ oii ]  emission line from galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the ratio of [ oii ]  flux measured with nb912 filter to that with nb921 filter is a good estimator of redshift for [ oii ]  emission line galaxies .",
    "we have 41 spectroscopic redshifts for [ oii ]  emitters identified by both nb912 and nb921 filters , which are mainly obtained by our near - infrared spectroscopic follow - up with moircs and fmos on the subaru .",
    "we confirm that such [ oii ]  emitters have a ratio of nb912-measured [ oii ]  flux to nb921 which is in good agreement with that expected from the filter response functions ( figure  [ fig;fluxratio ] ) .",
    "comparing with the spectroscopic redshift , @xmath53 , we show that the redshift from the difference of line flux , @xmath52 , can be derived with accuracy of @xmath54 .",
    "this demonstrates that the estimation of redshift from the emission fluxes measured with different but adjacent narrowband filters is quite reliable .    in this paper",

    "we then estimate the redshifts for the 170 [ oii ]  emitters from the fluxes measured with nb912 and nb921 and so map the three dimensional distribution of these galaxies around the galaxy cluster .",
    "in addition , we have a sample of h@xmath12  emitters at @xmath0 in the field , although it is limited to the central 13.65@xmath3213.65  region . due to the shallowness of the h@xmath12  data ,",

    "about half of them are identified by nb921 [ oii ]  emitters as well .",
    "our observations identify three - dimensional structures extending towards the centre of the galaxy cluster , some of which intersect other structures .",
    "the view we have found is consistent with a picture of hierarchical formation in which galaxy clusters are formed at the intersection of filamentary structures and grow through accretion of galaxies along the large scale structures . as we have already argued in @xcite",
    ", we reiterate that this galaxy cluster is active and galaxies in the surrounding region constitute the filamentary structures penetrating towards the centre of galaxy cluster at @xmath0 within which the vigorous evolution of galaxies is occurring .",
    "we also show the mild correlation between the local density calculated from the three dimensional distribution and the surface density estimated from the projected celestial distribution used in @xcite , suggesting the importance of the 3d view of structures for properly estimating the environment . however , we have found results consistent with @xcite in that galaxies with a red colour tend to be located in higher density region and that star - formation activity is not strongly dependent on the environment within the cluster or the surrounding structures .",
    "this implies that the growth of galaxies is on - going along the filaments and in the centre of the galaxy cluster , and the process which quenches their activity may work more efficiently in the core region than in the infall regions .",
    "unfortunately , spectroscopic data currently available are too sparse to discuss the change of galaxy properties in detail along the structures .",
    "we therefore require spectroscopic data covering multiple nebular emission lines in the rest - frame optical to further investigate the galaxy properties and processes critical for the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the use of two adjacent narrowband filters provides us with the accurate redshifts and emission line fluxes of galaxies , which enables to draw a three dimensional view of galaxy distribution as well as to properly derive the star - formation activity of the galaxies in the whole field surveyed . in the near future",
    ", it is expected that much larger samples of galaxies at high redshifts will be discovered by wider - field imaging surveys such as one with hyper suprime - cam on the subaru telescope .",
    "these samples will be too numerous to be observed spectroscopically . in this case",
    ", the method we apply in this paper can be a powerful tool for the accurate estimation of the redshift and emission line flux of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for carefully reading our manuscript and providing helpful comments .",
    "many of the data used in this paper are collected at subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "we thank the subaru telescope staff for their invaluable effort in our observation with suprime - cam in service programme .",
