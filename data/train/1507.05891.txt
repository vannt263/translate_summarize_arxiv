    "the specific heat of a system coupled infinitely weakly to a thermal heat bath always has to be positive .",
    "this statement derives directly from the fact that the specific heat is proportional to the variance of the system energy . by appropriately integrating the specific heat",
    ", it follows that also the entropy has to be positive .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of situations in which the existence of a negative specific heat or a negative entropy is discussed .",
    "such a situation immediately arises when the coupling between the system and the heat bath is no longer infinitely weak @xcite .",
    "then , the specific heat of the system can be defined as the difference between the specific heat of system plus heat bath on the one hand and the specific heat of the heat bath alone on the other hand . while there is no reason why the difference of two positive numbers has to be positive",
    ", one would typically expect that coupling additional degrees of freedom will increase the specific heat .",
    "the difference of specific heats just introduced is therefore expected to be positive .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the entropy .",
    "a notable exception is the damped free particle , for which under appropriate circumstances , the specific heat can become negative @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this system consists in the fact that its properties depend on the dimensionless ratio @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath2 the damping constant while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the boltzmann constant and the planck constant , respectively . as a consequence and",
    "in contrast to common expectations , decreasing the damping constant @xmath2 will render the free particle more classical and shift the transition to the quantum behavior to lower temperatures .",
    "a negative specific heat in the sense just discussed is also found in certain systems in condensed - matter physics and related fields @xcite .",
    "another important case where negative entropies give rise to considerable interest is the casimir effect which we will consider in more detail in the present paper . even though experimentally the casimir force is much more relevant than the casimir entropy ,",
    "the former contains a significant zero - temperature contribution while the latter allows to focus on the effect of thermal photons .",
    "suppose that we consider the casimir interaction between two objects . with each of the objects as well as with the combination of the two objects we can associate an entropy as the difference between the entropy of the electromagnetic field in the presence of the object(s ) and the entropy of the free electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir entropy is an interaction entropy which then is obtained by subtracting the entropies of the two individual objects from the entropy of the two objects . while individual entropies are not finite , the casimir entropy yields a finite value .",
    "one potential source of a negative casimir entropy is the coupling of the electromagnetic field to the electrons in the scattering objects .",
    "these electrons undergo a dissipative motion and therefore the electromagnetic response of the objects is characterized by a damping constant @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of dissipation inside the scatterers leads to a suppressed reflectivity of transverse electric ( te ) modes at low frequencies while the scattering of transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes is not affected significantly . as a consequence , in the plane - plane geometry a reduction of the casimir force @xcite and casimir entropy by a factor of two",
    "is found at high temperatures .",
    "the possibility of a negative casimir entropy has been the subject of an extensive debate over more than a decade @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of the role of dissipation in the casimir effect is of considerable interest for the interpretation of experiments .",
    "presently , there still exists disagreement about whether the dissipative low - frequency part of the electromagnetic response is relevant or not . while some experiments are interpreted in terms of the dissipation - less plasma model @xcite , other experiments are interpreted in terms of the drude model which includes dissipation @xcite . at this point , it is useful to recall that a nonvanishing value of @xmath2 is required for the lifshitz formula to be applicable @xcite .",
    "most casimir force measurements are carried out in the plane - sphere geometry with a surface - to - surface distance between 0.1 and a few micrometers .",
    "depending on the experiment , the radius of the sphere or the radius of curvature of a spherical segment ranges from @xmath5 m @xcite to about 20 cm @xcite .",
    "the latter case is rather close to a configuration of two parallel plates , where te and tm modes do not mix .",
    "however , with decreasing sphere radius , polarization mixing becomes increasingly relevant and it is important to understand how the occurrence of negative casimir entropies depends on dissipation in the plane - sphere and sphere - sphere geometry .",
    "the extension of the discussion of the negative casimir entropy due to dissipation beyond the plane - plane geometry is not the only purpose of this paper .",
    "in fact , it is known since some time , that negative casimir entropies can arise for the plane - sphere @xcite and the sphere - sphere @xcite geometry even for perfect conductors .",
    "an important question therefore concerns the relative status of the negative casimir entropies due to dissipation on the one hand and due to geometry on the other hand .",
    "recently , it was shown that the negative casimir entropy in the perfect metal plane - sphere and sphere - sphere geometries can be traced back to the mixing between the te and tm modes of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this identification became possible by realizing that negative casimir entropies are most pronounced at large distances between the scattering objects .",
    "then , within a scattering formalism , it is sufficient to consider one round - trip of electromagnetic waves between the scatterers and a decomposition into the various scattering channels becomes possible .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was argued that in the large - distance limit two drude - type metal objects will not allow for a negative casimir entropy because the reflection of the te modes is strongly suppressed and only a positive contribution of tm modes is left .",
    "this regime can be attained for any given damping strength by making the distance between the scattering objects sufficiently large .",
    "on the other hand , for any given distance of the objects , one can make the damping strength so small that a negative casimir entropy ensues .    in order to disentangle the contributions to a negative casimir entropy arising from dissipation and geometry",
    ", we will go beyond the electric dipole approximation , i.e. the rayleigh limit @xcite employed in ref .",
    "@xcite . while we will assume the distance @xmath6 between the scattering objects to be large compared to the radii of the spherical objects involved",

    "the sphere radii are chosen as @xmath37 .",
    "the arrows indicate the effect of the missing zero - frequency contribution to the casimir entropy for drude - type metals with respect to perfect conductors . ]",
    "we start by recalling in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]a the main features of the casimir entropy for drude - type metals in the plane - plane geometry .",
    "it is well known that a finite dc conductivity suppresses the zero - frequency contribution of the te modes , resulting in a reduction @xmath38 of the casimir entropy at high temperatures by a factor of two with respect to the case of an infinite dc conductivity @xcite .",
    "the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies ] visualize the effect of this missing zero - frequency contribution to the casimir entropy .",
    "since for perfectly conducting metals the casimir entropy decreases with decreasing temperature , the missing zero - frequency contribution of the te modes exceeds their contribution at finite temperatures . as a consequence , at sufficiently low temperatures , the casimir entropy for drude - type metals becomes negative ,",
    "provided the dc conductivity is sufficiently large . for the smallest value of the damping constant @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]a the entropy curve over a large temperature range ressembles closely that for a perfect conductor except for the entropy shift @xmath38 .",
    "the casimir entropy approaches its vanishing zero - temperature value only when the temperature falls below a temperature of the order of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the middle ( black ) curve therefore comes close to zero at much higher temperatures than the lower ( blue ) curve .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the damped free particle discussed in the introduction where the temperature scale is also set by the damping constant @xmath2 .",
    "a reduction of the casimir entropy at high temperatures as well as negative values at lower temperatures with a crossover to vanishing casimir entropy on a temperature scale given by @xmath2 are also visible for the sphere - sphere geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]b and the plane - sphere geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]c .",
    "since the two geometries share the same qualitative features , we restrict the latter figure to negative values of the casimir entropy . in both figures , the sphere radii are chosen as @xmath37 to ensure the validity of the single round - trip dipole approximation .",
    "there are quantitative differences in the temperature dependence of the casimir entropy for the three geometries . while the temperature scale on which the casimir entropy approaches zero at low temperatures clearly increases with increasing damping constant @xmath2 , its value depends on the scattering geometry .",
    "in addition , the reduction of the casimir entropy at high temperatures amounts only to 1/3 for the plane - sphere geometry and 1/5 for the sphere - sphere geometry instead of 1/2 for the plane - plane geometry .",
    "this reduction is a consequence of the fact that for a perfectly conducting sphere the reflectivity of the te modes is only one half of the reflectivity of the tm modes .",
    "besides the features already present in the plane - plane geometry , an additional dip in the casimir entropy appears for the sphere - sphere and plane - sphere geometries at temperatures where @xmath40 is of order one .",
    "this feature is of geometric origin and survives even in the absence of dissipation as can be seen from the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]b and c. its position depends on the geometry and it is more pronounced in the sphere - sphere geometry .",
    "while for a damping constant as large as @xmath41 , i.e. for the upper ( red ) solid curves , the casimir entropy still becomes negative in the plane - sphere geometry , it remains positive for all temperatures in the sphere - sphere geometry .",
    "nevertheless , even there a remnant of the dip is visible .",
    "however , for sufficiently large damping constant @xmath2 , the contribution to the casimir entropy involving te modes will disappear @xcite . for such strong",
    "damping , the electrons will suffer many collisions during an oscillation period of the electromagnetic field for all relevant frequencies .",
    "the total irradiating power in the te modes will then be dissipated , thereby suppressing the reflection of these modes .",
    "the temperature dependence of the casimir entropy displayed in figs .  [ fig : pp_sp_ss_entropies]b and c suggests that the negative casimir entropy can be separated into contributions of dissipative and of geometric origin .",
    "this is particularly clear for the sphere - sphere geometry for which we will demonstrate in the second half of this section that the expected separation is indeed possible in terms of different scattering channels . even though we will be able to disentangle geometric and dissipative parts , figs .",

    "while the first mechanism has been studied for quite some time in the plane - plane geometry , the second mechanism was identified for plane - sphere and sphere - sphere geometries with perfect conductors . for drude - type metals of sufficiently large dc conductivity",
    ", we have shown the coexistence of both mechanisms by going beyond the rayleigh limit .    in the large - distance limit , where only single round - trips are relevant , we employed a scattering - channel analysis to disentangle dissipative and geometric origins of the negative casimir entropy . concentrating on the sphere - sphere geometry",
    ", we found that dissipation acts via the te channel as in the plane - plane geometry .",
    "in contrast , the geometric contribution can be traced back to the polarization - mixing channel as in the perfectly conducting case .",

    "focussing on the geometrical origin of negative casimir entropies , we have found for perfectly conducting scatterers that while the dipole - dipole channel can lead to a negative contribution to the casimir entropy , higher multipoles yield a positive contribution . with decreasing distance between the scatterers ,",
