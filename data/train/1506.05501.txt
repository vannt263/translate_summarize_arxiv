    "understanding chemistry is indispensible to deciphering the abundances of atomic and molecular species present in an exoplanetary atmosphere . despite its somewhat late start in the study of exoplanets ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", atmospheric chemistry has a long and rich history in the earth and planetary sciences and the study of brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . yet , a first - principles , self - consistent formalism that unifies all of the quantities and terminology in a form that is useful for astrophysicists is missing from the literature .",
    "for example , there is more than one definition of the  equilibrium constant \" .    within the same framework",
    ", we demonstrate that the vant hoff equation ( which describes the dimensionless form of the equilibrium constant ) , the arrhenius equation ( which describes the rate coefficients ) and procedures associated with the gibbs free energy ( minimisation and scaling ) all originate from the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "the foundations of atmospheric chemistry are built upon statistical mechanics , since the first law derives from it . to demonstrate the usefulness of our formalism , we use it to compute analytical solutions of chemical systems with pure hydrogen and with carbon , oxygen and hydrogen ( gas phase only ) ;",
    "we show that these solutions generalise the work of @xcite and correctly reproduce all of the expected trends .",
    "the novelty of the present study is not in the individual formulae stated , which are mostly previously known ; with one exception , we certainly do not claim to be the first to derive these formulae .",
    "rather , it is in the way these results are derived and unified under a common , self - consistent , mathematical formalism that is accessible and palatable to astrophysicists ( rather than to chemists ) .",
    "we will now demonstrate this claim of novelty by surveying several textbooks in chemistry .",
    "specifically , equations ( [ eq : gibbs_differential ] ) , ( [ eq : gibbs_total ] ) , ( [ eq : gibbs_scaling ] ) , ( [ eq : keq ] ) , ( [ eq : two_keq ] ) and ( [ eq : arrhenius2 ] ) are commonly stated in textbooks .",
    "our intention is to weave a common mathematical thread between them .",
    "we have surveyed the monographs of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and verified that , while each lists some subset of these formulae , none of them derive and unify all of these formulae in the manner of the present study . none of these monographs derive the generalised form of the arrhenius equation that we present in equation ( [ eq : arrhenius2 ] ) or the generalisation of the @xcite analytical solutions we present in  [ subsect : cho ] .",
    "in general terms , we consider a chemical reaction involving a pair of reactants ( x@xmath0 and x@xmath1 ) , which produces a pair of products ( z@xmath0 and z@xmath1 ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the stoichiometric coefficients .",
    "the reactants and products may be atoms or molecules of arbitrary stoichiometry .",
    "the forward and reverse reactions are described by the rate coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "whenever we discuss something in general terms , it will always be with reference to the preceding chemical reaction .",
    "if we denote the specific internal energy by @xmath9 , the temperature by @xmath10 and the specific entropy by @xmath11 , then a reasonable guess for the excess energy associated with a chemical reaction is the helmholtz free energy @xcite , @xmath12 it turns out that this quantity is not general enough because it does not consider the work done on the system .",
    "the general quantity is known as the gibbs free energy @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pressure , @xmath15 is the specific volume and @xmath16 is the mass density .",
    "the gibbs free energy plays a role analogous to the lagrangian of classical mechanics , which is the difference between the kinetic and potential energies of a system . instead of solving newton s equation directly , one may minimise the lagrangian , a technique known as the principle of least action .",
    "gibbs free energy minimisation and chemical kinetics are the chemical analogues to these two techniques .    in a chemically - active system , the number of particles of each species is generally not a conserved quantity . if we denote the number of particles associated with the @xmath17-th species of the system by @xmath18 , then the first law of thermodynamics needs to be modified @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the chemical potential associated with each species .",
    "the sum is performed over all of the species in the system .    by using the definition of @xmath21 and the product rule",
    ", one may show that @xcite @xmath22 we will now proceed to show that a variety of useful quantities originate from this equation , which is essentially still the first law of thermodynamics .      generally , the entropy of a system increases according to the second law of thermodynamics ; at constant temperature and pressure , its gibbs free energy generally decreases and seeks a minimum .",
    "if one is interested in solving for the chemical equilibrium of a network of reactions , then one needs to minimise the gibbs free energy of the system @xcite . within the context of our formalism",
    ", we will now elucidate the exact expressions involved in this minimisation . generally , we have @xmath23 and equation ( [ eq : gibbs_differential ] ) can not be straightforwardly integrated .",
    "however , at a constant temperature and pressure  which is the typical circumstance under which one performs gibbs free energy minimisation  equation ( [ eq : gibbs_differential ] ) reduces to @xmath24 the integration can be performed trivially to yield @xcite @xmath25 it is not uncommon to see @xmath21 being _ defined _ as the product of the chemical potential and the number of particles of a given species . strictly speaking , it is not a definition  rather",
    ", it is the expression for @xmath21 in the isothermal and isobaric limit",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : gibbs_total ] ) is the quantity we need to minimise , but we need additional equations to close the system . in the absence of nuclear reactions , this arises naturally from the notion that the elemental building blocks of molecules can not be created or destroyed .",
    "thus , the number of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , etc , atoms in a system is invariant between the reactants and the products , whether they exist in their atomic form or are sequestered in molecules .",
    "mathematically , this set of book - keeping equations takes the form @xcite , @xmath26 the matrix @xmath27 states the number of atoms of species @xmath28 present in the molecular species @xmath17 . the number of atoms of species @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "a persistent source of confusion exists in the literature regarding the definition of the equilibrium constant .",
    "several references list it as being composed of a series of partial pressures associated with the reactants and products and equates it to an exponential term involving the gibbs free energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath30 taken at face value , the partial pressure has physical units .",
    "since the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants ( @xmath31 ) and the products ( @xmath32 ) are generally unequal , @xmath33 must generally have physical units and can not be equated to an exponential term ( which is by definition dimensionless ) , unless the partial pressures have somehow been normalised .",
    "it is not always explicitly explained that this normalisation has been performed . several monographs have previously mentioned this normalisation procedure @xcite , but we will now provide a derivation that is consistent with the rest of our formalism .",
    "to derive the equilibrium constant , we return to equation ( [ eq : gibbs_differential ] ) and consider it in the limit of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if we invoke the ideal gas law ( @xmath36 ) , then we obtain ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a reference pressure , @xmath39 is the specific gas constant and @xmath40 .",
    "the preceding equation is useful for scaling the gibbs free energy to other pressures given its value at a reference pressure  it is exactly the equation one has to use when extracting @xmath21 for different values of @xmath14 from thermodynamic databases , which typically tabulate values of @xmath41 .",
    "we may use the preceding expression to combine the gibbs free energy of the reactants and products , weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients @xcite , @xmath42 where we have defined @xmath43 what is interesting is that this first - principles approach naturally yields the definition for the equilibrium constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath44 notice that this equilibrium constant is naturally dimensionless ; its derivation is similar to the ones given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who obtained it in terms of chemical potentials and activities .",
    "the factors of @xmath38 appear without being inserted in an ad hoc manner .",
    "physically , the system adjusts itself until it reaches chemical equilibrium , which occurs when @xmath45 .",
    "let the reference state , characterised by @xmath38 , _ not _ be in equilibrium , such that @xmath46 . if one is referring to a molecule , then @xmath47 is the energy needed to construct it from its constituent atoms  it is the gibbs free energy of formation . if one is referring to mixtures of molecules , then @xmath47 is the difference in the gibbs free energies of formation between the reactants and products .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gibbs_keq ] ) naturally yields the relationship between @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite , @xmath49    for example , while equations ( a1 ) and ( a6 ) of @xcite , equation ( 7 ) of @xcite , equation ( 5 ) of @xcite and equation ( 2 ) of @xcite do not explicitly mention the factors of @xmath38 needed to render @xmath48 dimensionless , it is common practice to omit these reference - pressure terms in standard treatments of chemical equilibria .",
    "we now seek another possible definition of the equilibrium constant .",
    "let the number density be generally represented by @xmath50 ; self - explanatory subscripts relate it to the appropriate reactant or product . in chemical equilibrium",
    ", we expect the forward and reverse rate coefficients to be related as follows @xcite , @xmath51 a plausible , alternative definition for the equilibrium constant is @xcite @xmath52 note that since @xmath7 and @xmath8 generally do not possess the same physical units , @xmath53 is expected to be dimensional .",
    "we may relate our two definitions of the equilibrium constant @xcite , @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "as has been pointed out by @xcite , the  pressure correction term \" ( which is really a temperature correction term ) is sometimes missed by other workers .",
    "it is less well - known that this correction term has already been elucidated by @xcite .",
    "it vanishes when @xmath56 and we have @xmath57 ( which is commonly , but not always , true ) .    in other words",
    ", @xmath58 is used to  reverse \" the forward rate coefficients , but it is @xmath48 that relates it to the gibbs free energy .",
    "equation ( [ eq : two_keq ] ) relates them properly . in the literature ,",
    "what we have defined as @xmath48 and @xmath58 are often denoted , respectively , by @xmath59 and @xmath48 instead ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although such an approach is not universally adopted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we differentiate equation ( [ eq : gibbs_keq ] ) with respect to the temperature , we obtain the vant hoff equation @xcite , @xmath60 note that we are allowed to go from equation ( [ eq : gibbs_keq ] ) to ( [ eq : vant_hoff ] ) only because we have _ constructed _ @xmath47 to be isothermal .    in most incarnations of the vant hoff equation",
    ", it is the change in enthalpy , rather than the gibbs free energy , which is stated @xcite . if the system is isothermic and adiabatic , then these two statements are equivalent @xcite .          [",
    "fig : activation ]    we next derive the expressions for the rate coefficients . at this point , we need to invoke the notion of the activation energy , which is the energy barrier associated with a forward or reverse reaction .",
    "one may think of the reactants and products as being two different stable states residing at different energy levels .",
    "to transition from one state to the other requires that one surmounts an energy barrier , which is the activation energy ( figure [ fig : activation ] ) .",
    "the barrier of the activation energy originates from the need to overcome bond strengths and the requirement that the reactants have specific orientations during a collision . for a single reaction , the difference between the activation energies of the forward and reverse reactions is the change in the enthalpy , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the activation energies associated with the forward and reverse reactions , respectively , and @xmath64 is the change in entropy at the reference pressure .",
    "the preceding expression allows us to cast the adjectives  exothermic \" and  endothermic \" in more precise , mathematical terms .",
    "if the activation energy of the forward reaction exceeds that of the reverse one , then one needs to inject energy into the system for it to proceed , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "one refers to this as an endothermic reaction .",
    "reactions with @xmath66 are exothermic .    by combining the expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath58",
    ", we obtain @xmath67 the symmetries inherent in the preceding equation suggests that it may have been constructed from two independent governing equations for the rate coefficients @xcite .",
    "mathematically ,  splitting \" this equation is a degenerate endeavor and is not rigorous . to persist in this endeavor",
    ", we have to appeal to physics .",
    "first , we expect that the governing equations for @xmath7 and @xmath8 must enjoy a large degree of symmetry between them .",
    "second , we expect @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be associated with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "thus , a plausible guess is that the preceding equation originated from the difference between these two equations , @xmath68 the coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 can not be stated uniquely .",
    "for example , we can have @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; we may also have @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this mathematical freedom implies that @xmath69 and @xmath70 may take on a range of values and may be positive or negative .",
    "finally , we end up with the arrhenius equations , @xmath75 where we necessarily have @xmath76 the pre - exponential factor @xmath77 absorbs terms associated with @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath64 ; its counterpart , @xmath80 , does the same for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath64 . absorbing the entropy into the pre - exponential factors",
    "was previously noted by @xcite , but our derivation is more general as it involves @xmath78 and @xmath81 .",
    "we note that one may also use the vant hoff equation as a starting point for the derivation .",
    "traditionally , derivations or statements of the arrhenius equation include only the exponential term involving the activation energy @xcite .",
    "they omit the power - law terms and tag them on , after the fact ( e.g. , @xcite ) , partially as a means of using them as fitting functions for experimental data .",
    "our derivation demonstrates that there is a sound basis to including these terms .",
    "thus , the arrhenius equations attain a status that is elevated above that of mere ad hoc fitting functions .",
    "typically , @xmath83 and @xmath84 suffice for low temperatures ;  non - arrhenius \" behavior , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , is important at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "kinetic theory states that the rate coefficient is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the cross section for collisions between the reactants and @xmath89 is the relative velocity between them .",
    "if @xmath88 is independent of the relative velocity , then @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath88 depends on the relative velocity , then more general power - law dependences on @xmath10 are possible .",
    "the arrhenius equations do not account for three - body reactions .",
    "when the number density of the third body is low , the reaction rate is linearly proportional to it .",
    "as it increases , a point is reached where the reaction rate saturates to a limiting value .",
    "fitting functions for implementing this saturation effect have previously been given by , for example , @xcite .",

    ", one may argue that increasing @xmath91 values correspond to decreasing temperatures .",
    "figure [ fig : hydrogen ] shows the curves of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . as expected , molecular hydrogen prevails at low temperatures . so far , our toy model does not allow us to define what  low \" is , as we have not related @xmath91 to @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",

    "we consider the reaction of methane with water to form carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen @xcite , @xmath105 the formulae presented in the appendix of @xcite consider only this reaction and thus are unable to represent carbon - rich atmospheres , where a variety of hydrocarbons are present at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "if these hydrocarbons are excluded , then one gets the spurious result that methane is always the dominant carbon carrier at high temperatures and in carbon - rich situations . our desire for an analytical model does not allow us to include all of the hydrocarbons that are expected to form .",
    "instead , we assume that acetylene is the dominant hydrocarbon and include it via the following reaction @xcite , @xmath106 if nitrogen is present , we expect hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) to form as well @xcite , but in the interest of algebraic tractability we will not include it .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown using calculations of chemical kinetics that acetylene and hydrogen cyanide are the dominant hydrocarbons in carbon - rich atmospheres .    in reality , both reactions are net reactions that consist of large networks of individual reactions , some of which produce transient species en route to the products .",

    "methane dominates carbon monoxide as the carrier of carbon @xcite ; this trend reverses at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "* when the atmosphere is carbon - rich , methane is the dominant molecule but has to compete with acetylene in some circumstances @xcite .",
    "water is the dominant oxygen carrier only at low temperatures , superceded by carbon monoxide at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "* cold atmospheres are always methane - rich at the expense of carbon monoxide , regardless of the c / o @xcite .",
    "the abundance of water is essentially constant across c / o @xcite .",
    "* hot atmospheres exhibit more complex behavior , in that they are methane - poor and water - rich when @xmath144 @xcite . for @xmath145 ,",
    "they become methane - rich and water - poor @xcite with methane dominating carbon monoxide as the carrier of carbon when c / o becomes sufficiently larger than unity @xcite . when c / o is large enough , acetylene overtakes methane as the dominant carrier of carbon @xcite .",
    "these trends are in agreement with the numerical calculations of equilibrium chemistry presented in @xcite and @xcite , but with one exception .",
    "we have assumed @xmath146 ; higher values would produce the unphysical result that acetylene dominates carbon monoxide , even at low temperatures ( not shown ) . the cold model in the lower panel of figure [ fig : cho ] shows an overabundance of acetylene , which is in disagreement with figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy arises from the fact that @xmath124 is not a constant and must possess a ( steep ) temperature dependence .    to investigate this discrepancy further , we stop treating @xmath91 and @xmath123 as free parameters and instead relate them to temperature and pressure via the gibbs free energy tabulated in the janaf database ( ` http://kinetics.nist.gov/janaf/ ` ) .",

    "[ fig : cho_2 ] , we recalculate the models in figure [ fig : cho ] .",
    "we see that the basic trends previously discussed are preserved , although the curves display quantitative differences as expected .",
    "the mixing ratios versus c / o match surprisingly well even at a quantitative level .",
    "the previous result regarding acetylene is verified to be an artifact of assuming @xmath124 to be constant .",
    "we further verified that acetylene becomes dominant over methane only for carbon - rich atmospheres with @xmath147 k ( not shown ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "overall , it is surprising how well our model is able to reproduce the main trends of mixing ratios versus the carbon - to - oxygen ratio .",
    "it is surprising because this rich variety of behavior originates from the chemical analogue of geometry  it is merely stoichiometric book - keeping @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the normalised equilibrium constants on temperature is a distraction if all one seeks is to understand these trends in a qualitative sense .",
    "we have presented a unified , novel , self - consistent formalism for understanding the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist . in doing so , we addressed ambiguities associated with the equilibrium constant and obtained a novel derivation of the arrhenius equation .",
    "we also generalised previous work on analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium with carbon , hydrogen and oxygen and showed that they reproduce several key trends published in the literature and computed using more sophisticated numerical calculations .",

    "for completeness , we restate the formalism concerning chemical kinetics .      unlike gibbs free energy minimisation ,",
    "chemical kinetics is the treatment of a network of reactions as a system of mass conservation equations .",
    "the evolution of the reaction x@xmath0 is described by the partial differential equation , @xmath148 the importance of the @xmath149 factor can not be over - stated : it allows for the reaction rates of reactants and products with different stoichiometric coefficients to be placed on the same footing @xcite .",
    "the production and loss rates are @xmath150 the reaction rate associated with photochemistry is given by @xmath151 , which generally depends on @xmath152 .    the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath153 ) is used to _ mimic _ advection , convection and turbulence and subsume their collective influence into a single free parameter .",
    "generally , advection , convection and turbulence hardly resemble diffusion in any rigorous way  one often argues that these processes operate on scales that are so small , compared to the characteristic atmospheric length scale of interest , that it  looks \" like diffusion .",
    "the use of @xmath153 is rigorous and exact only for molecular diffusion .",
    "notwithstanding , the inclusion of a diffusion coefficient allows us to treat situations with disequilibrium chemistry induced by atmospheric motion or mixing without resorting to a full - blown , three - dimensional calculation .    for the product @xmath154 ,",
    "the evolution equation is @xmath155 where the production and loss rates are @xmath156      in the absence of atmospheric mixing ( @xmath157 ) , we may add the evolution equations for x@xmath0 and z@xmath0 to obtain @xmath158 if we integrate this expression , we obtain @xmath159 if we do the same for all combinations of reactants and products , then we obtain @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are constants of integration .",
    "this result informs us that photochemistry is an intrinsically disequilibrium effect , because it allows the total number of particles in the system to vary with time . in its absence",
    ", the total number of particles is an invariant quantity .",
    "if we neglect atmospheric mixing and photochemistry , the steady - state limit of the evolution equations yields @xmath163 since this is identical to the setup in which we used to define our dimensional equilibrium constant ( @xmath58 ) , we conclude that our evolution equations correctly produce chemical equilibrium in the steady - state limit .",
    "we use the gibbs free energy associated with the hydrogen atom from the janaf database . here , we list it in units of kj / mol / k , from 0 to 6000 k ( in increments of 100 k ) and at @xmath164 bar : 216.035 , 212.450 , 208.004 , 203.186 , 198.150 , 192.957 , 187.640 , 182.220 , 176.713 , 171.132 , 165.485 , 159.782 , 154.028 , 148.230 , 142.394 , 136.522 , 130.620 , 124.689 , 118.734 , 112.757 , 106.760 , 100.744 , 94.712 , 88.664 , 82.603 , 76.530 , 70.444 , 64.349 , 58.243 , 52.129 , 46.007 , 39.877 , 33.741 , 27.598 , 21.449 , 15.295 , 9.136 , 2.973 , -3.195 , -9.366 , -15.541 , -21.718 , -27.899 , -34.082 , -40.267 , -46.454 , -52.643 , -58.834 , -65.025 , -71.218 , -77.412 , -83.606 , -89.801 , -95.997 , -102.192 , -108.389 , -114.584 , -120.780 , -126.976 , -133.172 , -139.368 .",

    "<S> we present a self - consistent formalism for computing and understanding the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist . starting from the first law of thermodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the vant hoff equation ( which describes the equilibrium constant ) , arrhenius equation ( which describes the rate coefficients ) and procedures associated with the gibbs free energy ( minimisation , rescaling ) have a common physical and mathematical origin . </S>",
    "<S> we address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium constant , which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate coefficients , and restate its two definitions . by necessity </S>",
    "<S> , one of the equilibrium constants must be dimensionless and equate to an exponential function involving the gibbs free energy , while the other is a ratio of rate coefficients and must therefore possess physical units . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the arrhenius equation takes on a functional form that is more general than previously stated without recourse to tagging on ad hoc functional forms . finally , we derive analytical models of chemical systems , in equilibrium , with carbon , hydrogen and oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> we include acetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends , versus temperature and carbon - to - oxygen ratio , published in the literature . the rich variety of behavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the carbon - to - oxygen ratio is merely the outcome of stoichiometric book - keeping and not the direct consequence of temperature or pressure variations . </S>"
