    "exotic properties of low - dimensional antiferromagnets have continued to attract much attention in the research field of condensed matter physics , since strong quantum spin fluctuation destroys classical nel ordering even at zero temperature , while it leads to various types of quantum disordered states .",
    "@xcite in fact , substantial advances in material synthesis and experimental probes have made it possible to gain deep insights into strange spin - liquid phases and quantum phase transitions in realistic low - dimensional compounds .",
    "in particular , a class of spin - gapped antiferromagnets has provided rich macroscopic quantum phenomena such as spin - peierls transition and impurity - induced magnetic ordering in cugeo@xmath1 ,  @xcite and bose - einstein condensation of magnons in tlcucl@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    microscopic aspects of the spin - gapped phase in low - dimensional antiferromagnets have been extensively discussed on the basis of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg model . in general , a spin gap is defined as the energy difference between singlet ground and triplet first - excited states . the existence of the finite spin gap can be understood by the concept of a valence - bond state .",
    "one typical example is a spin-1/2 heisenberg zigzag chain .",
    "@xcite in fact , the combined effects of quantum fluctuation and geometrical frustration yield a transition from a gapless spin - liquid phase to a gapped dimer phase . in the gapped dimer phase ,",
    "a valence bond of neighboring spins is stabilized , but the correlations among the valence bonds are significantly suppressed due to the effect of spin frustration , implying that finite energy is required to excite the valence bond from singlet to triplet .    in experiments , as for a model material of the zigzag spin chain , several compounds have been reported , such as srcuo@xmath2 ,  @xcite cu(ampy)br@xmath2 ,  @xcite and ( n@xmath2h@xmath3)cucl@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite however , a candidate material with a significant spin gap has not been found , since the frustration effect is much weak in these materials .",
    "in such a circumstance , in order to realize the spin - gapped dimer phase in a region of the strong spin frustration , it is important to explore the way to control the degree of the spin frustration . in this context , it is expected that orbital degree of freedom is a key ingredient to cause highly non - uniform spin exchange interactions . indeed , since @xmath5- and @xmath6-electron orbitals in recently focused materials are spatially anisotropic , the sign and magnitude of spin exchange interactions depend on the relative positions of ions and occupied orbitals .",
    "in such a case , we envision that orbital ordering occurs so as to minimize the magnetic energy of the spin system .",
    "in fact , we have found that orbital ordering actually relaxes the frustration effect in the exchange interaction due to the spatial anisotropy of relevant orbital , even though the lattice originally exhibits a geometrically frustrated structure .",
    "@xcite    after the occurrence of orbital ordering , one may naively expect that the system is described by an effective spin system on the frozen background of orbital arrangement .",
    "it is true that we can intuitively understand what kind of magnetic correlation develops in the static orbital ordering .",
    "however , since spin and orbital degrees of freedom strongly interact with each other at the same energy scale , spin dynamics is influenced by orbital one in principle , unless orbital degree of freedom is completely quenched .",
    "such interplay of spin and orbital dynamics has been discussed for spin - orbital models .",
    "@xcite here , we point out that even though we observe a spin gap , this would not be a pure spin excitation but includes the changes of both spin and orbital states . the spin gap is definitely given by the energy difference between singlet ground and triplet first - excited states , but the orbital arrangement in the ground and excited states can be different .",
    "we believe that it is an intriguing issue to clarify how the spin excitation is described in such a variable background of orbital arrangement .    in this paper , we investigate the spin gap of an @xmath0-orbital hubbard model on a zigzag chain by numerical techniques . due to the appearance of a ferro - orbital ( fo ) arrangement ,",
    "the system can be always regarded as a one - orbital system irrespective of the level splitting .",
    "when two orbitals are degenerate , the zigzag chain is decoupled to a double - chain spin system to suppress the spin frustration due to the orbital anisotropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital anisotropy is controlled by the level splitting , leading to the revival of the spin frustration and a finite spin - excitation gap .",
    "however , the orbital arrangement is found to change according to the spin excitation , suggesting an important concept of dynamical interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "ii , we describe the model hamiltonian and numerical techniques . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results of the spin and orbital structures in the ground state . taking account of the orbital arrangement , we will introduce an effective heisenberg model .",

    "6(c ) , the deviation is reduced with increasing @xmath39 , indicating that the spin gap is well reproduced by the effective heisenberg model with the optimal orbital , when the charge and orbital fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "thus , we conclude that active orbital degree of freedom influences on the spin gap , suggesting that the spin gap should be considered as a spin - orbital gap .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed ground - state properties and spin gap of the @xmath0-orbital hubbard model on the zigzag chain . we have found that the system is regarded as an effective spin system on the orbital - arranged background due to the orbital arrangement . at @xmath37=0 ,",
    "two orbitals are degenerate , but 3@xmath18@xmath16@xmath17 orbital is selectively occupied so as to suppress the spin frustration due to the orbital anisotropy . on the other hand , the orbital anisotropy is controlled by @xmath37 . with increasing @xmath37 ,",
    "the lower 3@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 orbital is favorably occupied and the orbital anisotropy almost disappears , leading to the revival of the spin frustration . note that the lower 3@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 orbital is also occupied in the atomic limit @xmath39@xmath112@xmath89 for @xmath37@xmath930 .",
    "then , the system is corresponding to the gapped dimer phase of the zigzag spin chain . in actual compounds , @xmath37 and @xmath39",
    "could be controlled by hydrostatic or chemical pressure , indicating the control of the degree of the spin frustration and a possible realization of the gapped phase of the zigzag spin chain .",
    "however , orbital degree of freedom is not completely quenched due to the level splitting even at @xmath37=1 .",
    "in fact , there appears a spatially non - uniform pattern of the optimal orbital especially around the edges so as to adjust to the lattice inhomogeneity .",
    "in addition , the orbital arrangement is flexibly deformed according to the change of the spin state . in order to discuss the spin - gap formation in multi - orbital systems",
    ", it is quite important to consider the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom , even when orbital degree of freedom is suppressed due to the level splitting .",
    "the spin gap is essentially determined by the spin - orbital coupled excitation .",
    "thus , it is quite natural to consider the spin gap as a spin - orbital gap .",
