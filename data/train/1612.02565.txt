    "each particle moves along its orientation vector at constant speed ( @xmath6 ) , and their equations of motion take the simple form : @xmath7 we separate the particle ensemble into two groups of equal size following either the direction @xmath8 ( right movers ) or @xmath9 ( left movers ) according to a harmonic angular potential @xmath10 .",
    "the motile particles interact at a distance through a repelling torque : @xmath11 , where the effective angular energy simply reads @xmath12 . as sketched in fig .",

    "we use a rectangular simulation box of aspect ratio @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "we also restrain our analysis to @xmath24 , leaving two control parameters that are the repulsion strength @xmath16 and the overall density @xmath25 .",
    "the following results correspond to simulations with @xmath0 comprised between @xmath26 and @xmath27 particles .",
    "starting from random initial conditions , we observe two clearly distinct stationary states illustrated in figs .",

    "the system quickly phase separates . computing the local density difference between the right and left movers @xmath28 ,",
    "we show that this dynamical state is characterized by a strongly bimodal density distribution , see fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]e .",
    "the left and right movers quickly self - organize into counter - propagating lanes separated by a sharp interface , fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]b . in each stream , virtually no particle interact and most of the interactions occur at the interface . as a result the particle orientations are very narrowly distributed around their mean value , fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]f .",
    "in stark contrast , at high density and/or strong repulsion , the motile particles do not phase separate . instead , the two population mingle and continuously interact to form a homogeneous liquid phase with gaussian density fluctuations , and much broader orientational fluctuations , figs .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]d ,  [ stat_states_descr]e , and  [ stat_states_descr]f .",
    "this behavior is summarized by the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]c .",
    "although phase separation is most often synonymous of first order transition in equilibrium liquids , we now argue that the lane and the mingle states are two genuine non - equilibrium phases separated by a critical line in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "to do so , we first introduce the following order parameter : @xmath30 @xmath31 vanishes in the laning phase where on average all particles follow their preferred direction , and takes a non zero value otherwise .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ phase_transition]a how @xmath31 increases with the repulsion strength @xmath16 at constant @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath33 the order parameter averages to zero below @xmath34 , while above @xmath35 it sharply increases as @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , fig .",
    "[ phase_transition]b .",

    "we further confirm this hypothesis in fig .",
    "[ phase_transition]c , showing that the fluctuations of the order parameter diverge as @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "deep in the homogeneous phase the fluctuations plateau to a constant value of the order of @xmath40 . finally , the criticality hypothesis is unambiguously ascertained by fig .  [ phase_transition]d , which shows the power - law divergence of the correlation time of @xmath41 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of two distinct phases seemingly contradicts the recent prediction by glanz and lwen . in  @xcite",
    "they showed that ensembles of oppositely driven particles merely crossover from a homogeneous to a lane state upon increasing the driving amplitude .",
    "these results are however not contradictory . instead , this marked difference demonstrates the crucial role of self - propulsion at constant speed . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "the collision between two oppositely driven colloids would at most shift their position over an interaction diameter  @xcite .",
    "conversely , collisions between self - propelled particles result in persistent deviations transverse to their preferred trajectories for a finite set of impact parameters , see fig .",
    "[ fig_collisions]a and supplemental materials  @xcite .",
    "this persistent scattering stems from the competition between repulsion and alignement .",
    "when these two contributions compare , bound pairs of oppositely moving particles can even form and steadily propel along the transverse direction @xmath44 , figs .",
    "[ fig_collisions]a and  [ fig_collisions]b .",
    "we stress that this behavior is not peculiar to this two - body setting .",
    "persistent transverse motion of bound pair is clearly observed at the onset of laning .",
    "we therefore strongly suspect the resulting enhanced mixing to cause the sharp melting of the lane state .",
    "we now evidence long - range structural correlations in this novel active - liquid phase , and analytically demonstrate their universality . the overall pair correlation function of the active liquid , @xmath45 , is plotted in fig .  [ fig : g_x]a . at a first glance ,",
    "deep in the homogeneous phase , the few visible oscillations would suggest a simple anisotropic liquid structure .",
    "however , denoting @xmath46 and @xmath47 the preferred direction of the populations ( left or right ) , we find that the asymptotic behaviors of all pair correlation functions @xmath48 decay algebraically as @xmath49 with @xmath50 , fig .",
    "[ fig : g_x]b .",
    "this power - law behavior is very close to that reported in numerical simulations  @xcite and fluctuating density functional theories of oppositely driven colloids at finite temperature  @xcite .      in order to explain the robustness of these long - range correlations , we first provide a hydrodynamic description of the mingle state , and compute its structural response to random fluctuations .",
    "we first observe that the orientational diffusivity of the particles increases linearly with the average density @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]f inset .",
    "this behaviour indicates that binary collisions set the fluctuations of this active liquid , and hence suggests using a boltzmann kinetic - theory framework , see e.g  @xcite for an active - matter perspective . in the large @xmath16 limit ,",
    "the microscopic interactions are accounted for by a simplified scattering rule anticipated from eq .   and confirmed by the inspection of typical trajectories ( see fig .  [ stat_states_descr]a ) . upon binary collisions",
    "the self - propelled particles align their orientation with the center - to - center axis regardless of their initial orientation and external drive . assuming molecular chaos and binary collisions",
    "only , the time evolution of the one - point distribution functions @xmath52 reads : @xmath53+\\partial_\\theta \\left[\\partial_\\theta\\left ( \\hat{\\mathbf p}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf h}_{\\alpha}\\right ) \\psi_\\alpha\\right]=\\mathcal i^{\\rm coll}_{\\alpha}. \\label{boltzmann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the convective term on the l.h.s stems from self - propulsion , the third term accounts for alignment with the preferred direction @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) for the right ( resp . left ) movers . using the simplified scattering rule to express the so - called collision integral on the r.h.s",
    ", we can establish the dynamical equations for the density fluctuations @xmath56 around the average homogeneous state ( see methods for technical details ) . within a linear response approximation",
    ", they take the compact form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 describes the convection and the collision - induced diffusion of the @xmath46 species , and @xmath59 is the coupling term , crucial to the anomalous fluctuations of the active liquid : @xmath60 the two anisotropic diffusion tensors @xmath61 and @xmath62 are diagonal and their expression is provided in  @xcite together with all the hydrodynamic coefficients .",
    "@xmath59 is a particle current stemming from the fluctuations of the other species and has two origins .",
    "the first term arises from the competition between alignment along the driving direction @xmath63 and orientational diffusion caused by the collisions : the higher the local density @xmath51 , the smaller the longitudinal current .",
    "the second term originates from the pressure term @xmath64 : a local density gradient results in a net flow of both species ( see methods for details ) .",
    "this diffusive coupling is therefore generic and enters the description of any binary compressible fluid .    by construction this hydrodynamic description alone",
    "can not account for any structural correlation . in order to go beyond this mean - field picture we classically account for fluctuations by adding a conserved noise source to eqs .   and",
    "compute the resulting density - fluctuation spectrum  @xcite . at the linear response level , without loss of generality  @xcite ,",
    "we can restrain ourselves to the case of an isotropic additive white noise of variance @xmath65 .",
    "going to fourier space , and after lengthy yet straightforward algebra we obtain in the long wavelength limit  @xcite : @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and where @xmath68 is a noise average . the cross - correlation @xmath69 has a similar form ,",
    "see supplementary note .",
    "even though the above hydrodynamic description of active particles qualitatively differs from that of driven colloids , they both yield the same fluctuation spectra  @xcite .",
    "the non analyticity of eq",
    ".   in the long wavelength limit translates in an algebraic decay of the density correlations in real space : @xmath70 , in agreement with our numerical simulations , fig .",
    "[ fig : g_x]b .",
    "we emphasize that this prediction is not specific to the small - density regime and is expected to be very robust to the microscopic details of the interactions . while the above theory is valid in the limit of strong repulsion and small densities , in a supplementary document we use a kinetic theory valid in the opposite limit  @xcite , where the particle density is very large while the repulsion remains finite  @xcite .",
    "we recover the same hydrodynamic theory which as it turns out could have been also phenomenologically anticipated using conservation law and symmetry considerations  @xcite .",
    "a number of different non - equilibrium phenomena could result in a non analytic form of the structure factor as @xmath71 , and hence to algebraic density correlations @xcite .",
    "however , inspecting eq .  , we can identify the very ingredients required to yield the universal @xmath72 power law found both in active and driven binary mixtures .",
    "starting from two opposite populations undergoing longitudinal convection and diffusion ( @xmath58 in eq .  ) , the minimal coupling between the density excitations must either have the form of a longitudinal convective current @xmath73 , or of a transverse diffusive flux @xmath74 .",
    "both ingredients are present in our model ( @xmath75 in eqs .  ) .",
    "while the convective coupling is specific to motile units , collision - induced transverse diffusion holds in any liquid made of particles interacting via short range interactions ( away from dynamical arrest ) .",
    "+ in conclusion , we have demonstrated how the interplay between orientational and translational degrees of freedom , inherent to motile bodies , results in a critical transition between a phase separated and a mingled state in binary active mixtures .",
    "in addition we have singled out the very mechanisms responsible for long - range structural correlations in any ensemble of particles driven towards opposite directions , should they be passive colloids or self - propelled agents .",
    "let us summarize the main steps of the kinetic theory employed to establish eqs .  ,  .",
    "the so - called collision integral on the r.h.s of eq .   includes two contributions which translate the behavior illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stat_states_descr]a : @xmath76 the first term indicates that a collision with any particle located at @xmath77 reorients the @xmath46 particles along @xmath78 at a rate @xmath79 .",
    "the second term accounts for the random reorientation , at a rate @xmath80 , of a particle aligned with @xmath78 upon collision with any other particle . within a two - fluid picture ,",
    "the velocity and nematic texture of the @xmath46 particles are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the mass conservation relation , @xmath83 , is obtained by integrating eq",
    ".   with respect to @xmath84 and constrains @xmath85 .",
    "the time evolution of the velocity field is also readily obtained from eq .",
    ": @xmath86=\\bm{\\mathcal f}_{\\alpha},\\label{momentumconservation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term on the l.h.s is a convective term stemming from self - propulsion .",
    "the force field @xmath87 on the r.h.s of eq .",
    "reads : @xmath88 .",
    "the first term originates from the alignment of particles along the @xmath63 direction , the second term is a repulsion - induced pressure , and the third one echoes the collision - induced rotational diffusivity of the particles .",
    "an additional closure relation between @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is required to yield a self - consistent hydrodynamic description .",
    "deep in the homogeneous phase , we make a wrapped gaussian approximation for the orientational fluctuations in each population  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is equivalent to setting @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "as momentum is not conserved , the velocity field is not a hydrodynamic variable ; in the long wavelength limit the velocity modes relax much faster than the ( conserved ) density modes .",
    "we therefore ignore the temporal variations in eq .   and use this simplified equation to eliminate @xmath90 in the mass - conservation relation , leading to the mass conservation equation eq .  .",
