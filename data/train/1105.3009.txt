    "however , for a system in contact with a heat bath , a stochastic dynamics can be introduced by means of a master equation which assumes markovian processes inducing random flips between different states .",
    "one of the few cases in which the problem can be solved analytically is for a one - dimensional lattice , zero external magnetic field , and an opportune choice of the transition probability , as devised by glauber@xcite some decades ago .",
    "he calculated the dynamic susceptibility within a linear response framework , and found that the uniform magnetization decays exponentially , with a relaxation time given by an arrhenius law @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relaxation rate for an isolated spin .",
    "considering that , at low temperatures , the correlation length for model ( [ isingfm_general ] ) in one dimension is given by @xmath12,@xcite the dynamic critical exponent results in @xmath13 glauber s dynamics has been ever since applied in very different areas , comprising structural phase transitions@xcite , neural networks@xcite , chemical reactivity,@xcite and even bio - socio - econo - physics.@xcite    the recent discovery of single - chain magnets ( scms)@xcite spurred renewed interest for glauber s dynamics in magnetic nanomaterials .",
    "such systems show magnetic hysteresis without the onset of three - dimensional magnetic ordering . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the relaxation of the magnetization is so slow that also other very interesting dynamic phenomena have been observed with unprecedented clarity , including collective reversal@xcite and quantum tunneling@xcite . as a result ,",
    "after the discovery of the archetypal scm [ co(hfac)2nitphome ] ( hereafter denoted cophome),@xcite the number of scm compounds has been rapidly increasing.@xcite    the strong exchange interaction and one - dimensional character of cophome@xcite make it the ideal system where to observe the long - predicted@xcite slow relaxation of the magnetization . in cophome , owing to the very high value of the exchange constant ( @xmath14 k ) , the correlation length @xmath15 is huge , at low temperatures , in a zero magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the unavoidable presence of even a small density of defects causes the chain to break into finite segments whose average length , @xmath16 , can be much smaller than the correlation length , @xmath15 .",

    "the low temperature peak was attributed to finite - size effects.@xcite anyway , the frequency dependence of the peak for @xmath22 and @xmath23 remains unexplained .",
    "static and dynamic susceptibilities with a similar behavior have also been observed in different cobalt - organic single - chain magnets,@xcite in presence of a moderate static magnetic field ( @xmath24 koe ) and of lattice imperfections .",
    "the explanation of such features is thus becoming more pressing , as it can constitute an important tool for the analysis of the properties of a whole class of magnetic systems .    in systems with a very large correlation length , like the one - dimensional ising model at low temperatures , the introduction of an external magnetic field can have dramatic consequences .",
    "a static field @xmath5 strongly depresses the correlation length @xmath15,@xcite and this fact , in turn , should also strongly affect the dynamic susceptibility .",

    "the main advantages of this approximation , first proposed by huang@xcite for infinite chains , are : ( i ) it provides the exact steady - state solution,@xcite in contrast with the mean field approximation ; ( ii ) it is valid for any value of the applied field , in contrast with perturbation methods.@xcite    in this work , we develop the theoretical framework necessary to analyze the ac susceptibility measurements of single - chain magnets in presence of a static magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "we include in the theory@xcite the effect of an oscillating magnetic field with intensity much smaller than that of the static one , using a linear response framework . with these theoretical tools ,",
    "we can account for the dynamic behavior of cophome and other single - chain magnets .",
    "we directly compare the calculated behavior to previous@xcite and new experimental measurements of both the relaxation time and the ac susceptibility in presence of a static magnetic field @xmath5 . in this way",

    "it follows that the sublattice magnetizations are not compensated along @xmath30 , whereas they are compensated within the plane perpendicular to the chain axis .",
    "thanks to its ferrimagnetic and quasi - one - dimensional character ( the ratio between interchain and intrachain exchange constants is less than @xmath45),@xcite cophome was the first magnetic molecular compound to display slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures for @xmath46,@xcite a feature which was predicted long time ago by glauber@xcite in a one - dimensional model of ising spins , coupled by a nearest neighbor ferromagnetic exchange and interacting with a heat reservoir , causing them to change their states randomly with time .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily concerned with analyzing finite - size effects on the spin dynamics of cophome in presence of a non - negligible static magnetic field .",

    "thus we can conclude that , for the moderate values of @xmath162 and @xmath5 exploited in the present ac susceptibility experiments : ( i ) the frequency dependence of @xmath1 can be attributed solely to finite - size effects ; ( ii ) the approximation of a single dominating frequency is a good one for the calculation of the dynamic susceptibility .      in fig .",

    "as regards the dc field dependence of the relaxation time of the magnetization , @xmath4 , we can conclude that it is well reproduced by theory , provided that finite - size effects are included .",
    "in fact , in a measurement performed for an inhomogeneous cophome sample , no appreciable contribution to the relaxation time , @xmath4 , is expected from the infinite chain at low temperatures , owing to the high value of the exchange coupling ( @xmath14 k ) .",
    "for example from eq .",

    "in this paper , the spin dynamics of the archetypal molecular magnetic chain , cophome , in presence of an external magnetic field of any intensity , was investigated using a simplified model , consisting of a one - dimensional ising ferromagnet with a stochastic dynamics caused by the interaction of the spins with a heat reservoir.@xcite    in the framework of a local - equilibrium approximation , devised to truncate the infinite sequence of kinetic equations originated by the presence of a nonzero static magnetic field , and of a linear response of the system to a small oscillating field , we first calculated the dynamic susceptibility of an infinite chain .",
    "next , the theory was generalized to a finite , open ising chain .",
    "we showed that the dynamic susceptibility of an open chain with a finite number @xmath2 of spins can be expressed as a weighted sum of @xmath2 frequency contributions , related to the @xmath2 relaxation rates of the magnetization fluctuations . from the comparison with the ac susceptibility data obtained for nominally pure samples",
    "we can draw two conclusions : i ) the pure samples are really non - homogeneous , because regions with very low density of defects coexist with regions with relevant density of defects ; ii ) only the latter regions show a contribution to the dynamic relaxation , in the frequency range conventionally investigated by ac susceptibility measurements .    for doped cophome chains ,",
    "the approximation of a single dominating frequency was found to be quite satisfactory in order to account for ac susceptibility data@xcite in a moderate static magnetic field ( @xmath20 koe ) , both as a function of temperature and of the frequency of the small oscillating field .",
    "finally , it is worth observing that , on the basis of our calculation of the @xmath53- and @xmath41-dependence of the relaxation rates ( and corresponding frequency weights ) , we do not expect that the approximation of a single dominating frequency will be able to account for @xmath185h nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and muon spin rotation ( @xmath84sr ) experimental data@xcite in pure and zinc - doped cophome , because these techniques probe the local spin dynamics at frequencies ( @xmath186 mhz ) substantially higher than the typical frequencies ( @xmath186 khz ) used in an ac susceptibility experiment .",
