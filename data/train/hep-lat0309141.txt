    "last year we reported the existence of a sizable finite volume effect in the non - perturbative @xmath0 determined by the schrdinger functional ( sf ) method at a fixed lattice size ( @xmath2@xmath4const ) when the rg - improved gauge action is adopted in full three - flavor qcd  @xcite .",
    "this effect causes a constant deviation from the true non - perturbative value of @xmath0 , and yields @xmath5 errors in physical observables .",
    "this year we explain our strategy for removing the unwanted finite volume effect from @xmath0 and report the bare coupling dependence of the non - perturbative @xmath0 for three - flavor dynamical qcd .",
    "the basic strategy to obtain the non - perturbative @xmath0 with the sf setup is described in  @xcite .",
    "we used eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) of  @xcite for the sf boundary coupling of the rg - improved gauge action .",
    "the polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( phmc ) algorithm  @xcite is employed for the numerical simulation of the three - flavor dynamical qcd .    to remove the finite lattice size effect we fix the physical lattice extent @xmath3 so that @xmath6 corrections vanish with @xmath7 .",
    "this can be achieved by the following steps .",
    "+ ( 1 ) define the reference lattice size @xmath8 at a bare coupling value @xmath9 .",
    "this also defines the reference physical lattice extent @xmath10 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) for other @xmath11 s , the lattice sizes @xmath8 at each @xmath11 are estimated by the beta function .",
    "+ ( 3 ) determine @xmath0 and @xmath12 via the pcac condition with the sf setup at each @xmath11 on the corresponding lattice size @xmath8 .    in actual numerical simulations we employ the universal two - loop beta function to estimate @xmath8 .",
    "this causes a systematic error in the non - perturbative @xmath0 , which could be large in the strong coupling region .",
    "this systematic error , however , can be partly avoided by defining @xmath10 at the largest coupling value .",
    "we can also examine the magnitude of the error by investigating the @xmath2 dependences because the error only appears through the incorrect value of @xmath8 .    with the above consideration",
    "we take the following setup in the simulations .",
    "+ ( i ) we define @xmath10 so that @xmath13 holds at @xmath14 .",
    "+ ( ii ) we employ both @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and @xmath15 for other weaker couplings .",
    "+ ( iii ) we correct @xmath0 and @xmath12 at @xmath2 to those at @xmath8 using the one - loop correction calculated with the sf setup in finite lattice volume  @xcite .",
    "+ although the perturbative error from setup ( iii ) appearers in strong coupling region , the magnitude can be reduced when @xmath18 holds and @xmath2 dependence is small .",
    "the small @xmath2 dependence is confirmed at @xmath17 as shown later .",
    "we will briefly discuss the possible resolution of the systematic error from the use of perturbative beta function in the last section .",
    "we use the following non - perturbative tuning condition for @xmath0 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bare pcac quark mass and @xmath22 is the difference of the two bare pcac quark masses with different definition .",
    "the actual definitions are explained in  @xcite .",
    "the difference from the tuning condition we employed last year is the absence of the tree - level finite pcac quark mass which arises from the sf boundary for a finite lattice extent .",
    "the tree - level finite volume effect is tuned to the corresponding value at @xmath8 by setup ( iii ) together with the one - loop finite volume effect .",
    "as shown in setup ( iii ) , we use the following one - loop perturbative correction to convert @xmath0 and @xmath19 at @xmath2 to those at @xmath8 at each @xmath11 ; @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined as @xmath26_{\\mbox{\\tiny 1-loop}},\\\\   \\delta        { c_{\\mathrm{sw}}}(l / a;\\!l^{*}/a)\\!=\\ !",

    "we have carried out the numerical simulation in the region @xmath27 with the setup explained in sec .  [ sec2 ] .",

    "it was also found that below @xmath31 with @xmath32 it became difficult to satisfy the condition @xmath33 , which is why we employ @xmath34 at @xmath31 for the definition of the reference physical lattice extent .",

    "we show statistical errors only . the systematic error from the use of perturbative beta function",
