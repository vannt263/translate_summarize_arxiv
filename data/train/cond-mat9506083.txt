    "as experimental measurements of the properties of high temperature superconducting materials become more accurate , it has been observed that different cuprate compounds present slightly different properties . among these qualitative differences",
    "are the presence of incommensurate magnetic correlations , the symmetry of the pairing state , shape of the fermi surface ( fs ) , as well as the behavior of the resistivity with temperature .",
    "many models proposed to describe the cuprate superconductors are particle - hole symmetric and this makes it impossible to distinguish between electron and hole doped materials .",
    "the addition of a diagonal hopping term to the one band hubbard model has often been suggested as a way to handle the different properties between electron and hole - doped materials since such a term breaks particle - hole symmetry .",
    "even restricted to the family of hole doped materials the inclusion of a diagonal hopping has also been proposed in order to reproduce experimental photoemission ( pes ) data and band structure calculations . according to these estimations",
    ", the diagonal hopping parameter @xmath0 seems material dependent and some of the suggested values are @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and -0.45 for @xmath16.@xcite    recently , the effect of this @xmath0 hopping term has been analyzed in the weak coupling limit for the hubbard model@xcite as well as for the t - j model.@xcite it was reported that the fermi surface of the @xmath17 model in the non - interacting case is in agreement with experimental measurements for appropriate values of @xmath0 , while the fs of the @xmath10 model is not .",
    "the same occurs for the magnetic susceptibility and the sign change of the hall coefficient with doping.@xcite however , it is not clear how a moderate or strong coulombic interaction will modify the properties of weakly interacting electrons . in other words",
    ", it is not correct to deduce the value of a @xmath18 parameter in a hamiltonian using data from experiments where the @xmath19 parameter plays the key role .",
    "it is well known that strong correlations are fundamental in high @xmath20 models , thus it is likely that the bare @xmath0 is quite different from the renormalized one .    in this paper , we investigate the @xmath17 model in the intermediate coupling regime using quantum monte carlo techniques .",
    "we will compare the results with mean field calculations , as well as with the non - interacting limit and with experimental results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the model is introduced and its symmetry properties are discussed .",
    "spin - spin correlation functions and incommensurability are studied in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the behavior of the density @xmath21 as a function of chemical potential while local magnetic moments are discussed in section v. angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments and the shape of the fermi surface are studied in section vi .",
    "dynamical properties appear in section vii and the conclusions are presented in section viii .",
    "a mean field analysis is discussed in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath17 hamiltonian is given by @xmath22    @xmath23 where @xmath24 creates an electron at site @xmath25 with spin projection @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the number operator , the sum @xmath28 runs over pairs of nearest neighbor lattice sites , and the sum @xmath29 runs over pairs of lattice sites along the plaquette diagonals .",
    "@xmath30 is the on site coulombic repulsion , @xmath31 the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath32 the diagonal hopping amplitude , and @xmath4 is the chemical potential .    when @xmath33 the above hamiltonian is particle - hole symmetric , i.e. , it remains invariant after the particle - hole transformation operation    @xmath34    if @xmath35 the above transformation maps the hamiltonian in its particle - hole symmetric one but with @xmath36 , and vice versa .",
    "this means that the results obtained for negative ( positive ) @xmath0 below half - filling can be obtained from the results for positive ( negative ) @xmath0 above half - filling .",
    "in fact , this is the reason why to mimic the effect of electron and hole doping in the t - j model , ( which can not be doped above half - filling ) both signs of @xmath0 are studied below half - filling.@xcite then , it is clear that results above and below @xmath37 with different signs for @xmath0 are redundant and in this paper we will study the hamiltonian ( eq.(1 ) ) only below half - filling with positive and negative values for @xmath0 .",
    "we will set @xmath38 and @xmath39=0.2 unless stated otherwise .",
    "a spin density wave ( sdw ) mean field analysis ( see appendix ) of the @xmath17 model predicts the existence of antiferromagnetism at half - filling for @xmath40.@xcite at @xmath41 it can be shown that @xmath42 . thus , within the sdw mean field , adding a @xmath0 term appears to decrease the strength of the spin - spin correlations .",
    "this result is not unexpected if we consider the large u limit . in this case",
    "a heisenberg spin - spin interaction with @xmath43 appears between nearest neighbors sites and a @xmath44 is generated along the diagonals .",
    "the @xmath45 interaction introduces frustration and tends to decrease the tendency to antiferromagnetism . in fig.1-a",
    "we present quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results for the spin - spin correlations @xmath46 as a function of distance , at half - filling , for @xmath47 , @xmath10 and -0.2 on an @xmath48 lattice at @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , in both cases there is long range order ( or , better , a correlation larger than the system size ) but the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlations decreases when @xmath39 increases .",
    "this is true for either sign of @xmath0 since due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian at @xmath37 the spin - spin correlations must be the same for both signs of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar effect is observed in fig.1-b as @xmath5 is increased to 6 at @xmath50 .",
    "previous quantum monte carlo calculations on the 2d hubbard model have indicated that short range incommensurate magnetic correlations develop as the system is doped away from half - filling.@xcite after these results were reported , neutron scattering experiments revealed short range magnetic incommensuration in @xmath51 ( lsco).@xcite the qualitative agreement between theory and experiment was remarkable .",
    "however , at a fixed doping , the experimental peaks in the structure factor s(*k * ) appeared shifted away from @xmath52 by an amount larger than theoretically predicted .",
    "additional confusion arose when experiments were performed in other materials .",
    "it was found that @xmath53 does not show incommensurability@xcite while for @xmath54 ( ybco ) the result is unclear.@xcite several authors suggested that the addition of a material dependent @xmath0 term to the hubbard hamiltonian could explain the quantitative , as well as the qualitative , differences observed .",
    "all previous studies of the @xmath17 model have been carried out in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "there are some disagreements among the published results .",
    "bnard et al.@xcite concentrated on negative values of @xmath0 and used a perturbative approach .",
    "they found that incommensurability starts developing at a finite hole density which increases from half - filling as @xmath0 becomes more negative . a similar result , within rpa ,",
    "was obtained in ref.@xcite though these authors expect incommensurability to disappear for @xmath56 due to a decreasing intensity of the peaks in the spectral function .",
    "furukawa and imada@xcite studied positive values of @xmath0 using a zero temperature monte carlo algorithm for @xmath47 and @xmath57 .",
    "they found incommensurability , but with the peaks in s(*k * ) moving along the diagonals in the brillouin zone rather than towards the points @xmath58 and @xmath59 as found in the experiment and as it happens for @xmath10.@xcite gooding et al.@xcite performed exact diagonalization studies of the @xmath60 model that should resemble the strong coupling limit of the @xmath17 model . to increase the number of available momenta along particular directions in momentum space they did not use square clusters . for negative values of @xmath0 they observed incommensurability with s(*k * ) moving along the diagonals , while for positive values of @xmath0 the peak in s(*k * ) remained at @xmath61 for all the dopings they studied .    due to the disparity of all these results and to the lack of numerical data on large square lattices at more realistic couplings larger than @xmath47 , we decided to carry out a systematic study of the structure factor at @xmath62 on @xmath48 lattices using quantum monte carlo .",
    "we worked at a temperature @xmath63 since due to sign problems it is not possible to study lower temperatures away from half - filling .",
    "our results are presented in fig.2 where we show s(*k * ) along the directions @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) for @xmath62 at different fillings and for positive and negative values of @xmath0 . at half - filling ,",
    "s(*k * ) is independent of the sign of @xmath0 due to the symmetry in the hamiltonian described in sec.ii . as the density is reduced to @xmath66 , the strength of s(*k * ) at the peak",
    "is slightly smaller for negative @xmath0 ( fig.2-a ) than for positive @xmath0 ( fig.2-b ) . for negative ( positive ) hopping the maximum in s(*k * ) starts moving along the lines from @xmath61 to @xmath67 and @xmath9 and it reaches @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( 0.67 ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the intensity of the peak in s(*k * ) is drastically reduced as the doping increases .",
    "in fact , when incommensurability appears for positive @xmath0 ( fig.2-h ) the peak can barely be seen .",
    "however , one has to remember that these features could be strongly enhanced as the temperature decreases .",
    "we conclude that negative values of @xmath0 seem to favor incommensurability more than positive values do . for both signs of @xmath0 we found that doping away from half - filling , s(*k * ) peaks at @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 , i.e. the peak does not move along the diagonal contrary to the results of ref.@xcite . in fig.3",
    "we plot @xmath74 vs @xmath3 for @xmath75 , 0 and 0.2 and , for comparison , we also show the experimental results for lsco@xcite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 slightly decreases ( enhances ) incommensurability in comparison with the @xmath10 case .",
    "the results for @xmath75 are closer to the experimental data but to reach a better agreement , it appears that larger negative values of @xmath0 should be used ( @xmath77 linearly extrapolating the results at @xmath78 , 0 and -0.2 ) .",
    "this is an example where the value of @xmath0 suggested by comparing fermi surface shapes obtained from band structure calculations with the ones obtained in the non - interacting case ( @xmath75 for lsco ) does not provide a good fit for magnetic properties .",
    "we have tried to study the case @xmath56 , which is the value suggested for ybco .",
    "due to sign problems , which become worse as @xmath39 increases , we have been able to study only the case @xmath47 and @xmath79 on an @xmath48 lattice .",
    "we found that the onset of incommensurability occurs at lower doping ( @xmath80 ) but the intensity of the peak in the structure factor , s(*k * ) , decreases and it is very difficult to decide whether incommensurability has developed .",
    "this resembles the experimental results for ybco@xcite that do not allow to determine if the peak in s(*k * ) shifts away from @xmath61 .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite found a similar behavior.@xcite    previous analytical work@xcite predicted that @xmath74 would become different from 1 immediately upon doping for @xmath10 but only when the density reaches a critical value @xmath81 for @xmath36 .",
    "since we work on an @xmath48 lattice we only can detect incommensurability when @xmath74 jumps from 1 to 0.75 and thus we can not check the above mentioned behavior .",
    "however , we have not observed qualitative differences for the studied values of @xmath0 .",
    "our results do not support the claims made in ref.@xcite where it was reported that a positive value of @xmath0 does not induce incommensurability .",
    "we found that , in this case , a larger hole doping than was studied in ref.@xcite is required to observe the effect but the tendency to incommensurability eventually occurs .",
    "one of the reasons for the disagreement maybe the different symmetry of the clusters studied in ref.@xcite that may induce incommensurability along the diagonals rather than towards x and y as in the square clusters that we studied , and as it has been experimentally observed .    to summarize , in this section we have studied the behavior of the structure factor as a function of doping for positive and negative values of the diagonal hopping @xmath0 .",
    "we found that @xmath0 reduces the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlations at half - filling .",
    "away from @xmath37 a negative hopping promotes incommensuration at a lower doping than a positive one .",
    "using @xmath75 we did not find good agreement with experimental data for lsco showing that deducing bare values of @xmath0 based on pes data may be misleading . for @xmath56 incommensurability was difficult to observe due to the strong reduction in the intensity of the peak in the structure factor .",
    "this behavior resembles experimental results for ybco .",
    "a very important property of the hubbard model is the antiferromagnetic gap that appears at half - filling .",
    "this gap can be observed in the density of states by studying the spectral function @xmath82 ( see sec.vii ) or by analyzing the behavior of the density @xmath3 vs @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the chemical potential .",
    "it has been found that to change the doping from holes to electrons , @xmath4 has to cross the gap and a plateau at @xmath37 appears in the @xmath3 vs @xmath4 curve.@xcite since the gap increases with @xmath1 , so does the size of the plateau .",
    "in this section we will study the influence of @xmath0 on these results .    before describing the numerical data",
    "let us discuss the expected behavior in the sdw mean field approximation .",
    "we found that for the range of parameters analyzed in this paper , the value of @xmath83 that satisfies the mean field equations ( see appendix ) changes very little when @xmath0 is introduced .",
    "for example , working at @xmath5=4 , @xmath83 is 1.37 for @xmath41 , i.e. only slightly smaller than at @xmath10 where it takes the value 1.38 .",
    "however , the main effect of @xmath0 is in a distortion of the bands in such a way that the actual gap in the density of states ( dos ) is smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "for the values of @xmath0 studied , this effect is important only when @xmath83 is small .    in fig.4",
    "we show the mean field energy bands along @xmath84 in momentum space , for @xmath850 and @xmath86 and different values of @xmath83@xcite . in fig.4-a the bands for @xmath62",
    "are shown ; the gap is equal to @xmath83 which is 2.48 and it is defined by the difference of energy between the two bands at @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( actually at @xmath10 , the energies @xmath89 are degenerate along the line from @xmath59 to @xmath90 ) . when @xmath75 the effective gap has been reduced to 2.08",
    "although @xmath83 remains at 2.48 , as can be seen in fig.4-b , and it is then @xmath91 of the @xmath10 value .",
    "now the degeneracy along @xmath92 has been removed and the effective gap is defined by @xmath93 in the conduction band and @xmath94 in the valence band .",
    "results for @xmath47 are presented in fig.4-c and d. in this case the effective gap is reduced from 1.38 to 0.97 , being now @xmath95 of the original , when @xmath0 changes from 0 to -0.2 .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath5 decreases the effect of @xmath0 on the size of the gap becomes more important . in fig.4-e",
    "we present results for @xmath96 .",
    "this value is interesting because it is well known@xcite that the effective size of the gap is reduced in the weak - coupling case due to quantum fluctuations and this value of @xmath83 could provide a more accurate representation of the @xmath47 numerical data.@xcite note that in this case , when @xmath75 the effective gap is very small",
    ". then we would expect to see the plateau in @xmath3 vs @xmath4 very much reduced . for @xmath62 ,",
    "on the other hand , the gap changes only slightly at finite @xmath41 with respect to its value for @xmath10 ( see fig.4-a and b ) .",
    "then , as @xmath5 increases , keeping @xmath0 fixed , our expectation is that the effect of @xmath0 on the size of the gap will become increasingly irrelevant .",
    "now let us analyze the same problem but using qmc techniques .",
    "in fig.5-a , b , c we present @xmath3 vs @xmath4 for @xmath10 and @xmath97 on an @xmath48 lattice at @xmath49 in the non - interacting case .",
    "when @xmath0 is negative ( positive ) , half - filling is achieved for a negative ( positive ) value of the chemical potential rather than at @xmath98 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that , as we pointed out in section ii , the curve for @xmath78 can be obtained from the curve at negative @xmath0 using the prescription @xmath99 even with interactions present .",
    "then , below we will only present results for @xmath75 .    what is the effect of a finite coulombic repulsion ? in fig.5-d and e we present @xmath3 vs @xmath4 for @xmath47 and @xmath49 on an @xmath48 lattice . when @xmath10 ( fig.5-d ) , @xmath3 has a plateau centered at 1 and it is clear that the chemical potential has to move across the gap to change the doping from electrons to holes . for @xmath75 ( fig.5-e )",
    "the plateau is much smaller and the type of dopants can be changed from holes to electrons varying the chemical potential by a small amount .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with experimental data for the high @xmath20 cuprates obtained by j.  allen s group@xcite who observed that the chemical potential does not move across the gap as the dopants are changed from electrons to holes ( although these results have not been yet reproduced using other experimental techniques ) .",
    "one alternative explanation of our numerical results may be that the ground state in this case is paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetic gap does not exist , but as we showed in section iii ( fig.1-a ) long range antiferromagnetic order has already developed in our finite cluster for the couplings we used thus this idea is incorrect .",
    "the sdw mean field calculation presented in the appendix allows us to better interpret the data if we assume that the antiferromagnetic gap for @xmath47 is smaller than the mean field prediction due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "if this is the case , the effective gap almost disappears as it was shown before in fig.4-f . as the coulombic repulsion",
    "is increased to @xmath62 the plateau at @xmath37 reappears for @xmath75 as can be seen in fig.5-g . in this case",
    "the plateau is similar to the one observed for @xmath10 ( fig.5-f ) .",
    "this behavior is also in agreement with the sdw mean field results .",
    "the curves presented in fig.5 appear to be very smooth and they do not indicate the presence of phase separation in the system .    summarizing , in this section we studied the behavior of the density of electrons as a function of the chemical potential for positive and negative values of a diagonal hopping @xmath0 .",
    "we found that @xmath0 reduces the size of the gap .",
    "we also found that in weak coupling ( @xmath55 ) and at @xmath41 the chemical potential does not move across the naive gap of order @xmath1 when the dopants change from holes to electrons in agreement with the pes results of allen et al.@xcite at larger @xmath5 , the effect of @xmath0 becomes less important as observed in previous sections .",
    "the square of the magnetic moment per site is related to the probability of double occupancy @xmath100 through the expression    @xmath101    in the non - interacting case the probability of double occupancy is independent of @xmath0 , and it is given by @xmath102 .",
    "the effect of the interaction @xmath1 is to suppress the probability of double occupancy.@xcite in the interacting case @xmath103 depends on @xmath0 . as it can be seen in fig.6 , a negative @xmath0 decreases @xmath104 when compared with @xmath10 while a positive value increases it . at half - filling and using the symmetry described in section",
    "ii , it can be shown that the probability of double occupancy is independent of the sign of @xmath0 . according to eq.(3 ) the mean - square magnetic moment per site",
    "will slightly increase for negative @xmath0 and decrease for positive @xmath0 .",
    "in the last few years much progress has been made in the development of angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) techniques and reliable data for the quasiparticle dispersion near optimal doping for @xmath105 ( bi2212 ) and ybco have been obtained.@xcite the study of the quasiparticle peak as a function of energy and momentum provides the shape of the fermi surface for the different materials . until recently , some experiments seemed to provide evidence for large electron - like fs@xcite but these results have been lately challenged by aebi et al.@xcite using a new photoemission technique these authors have reported the presence of a so - called shadow band probably due to antiferromagnetic correlations@xcite , as well as the existence of features resembling hole pockets@xcite in bi2212 ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "arpes also provides information on the quasiparticle bandwidth which appears to be of the order of a fraction of ev independently of the material .",
    "note that this bandwidth is much smaller than the one predicted by lda calculations@xcite which casts doubts on the practice of selecting values of @xmath0 without properly considering the strong correlations .",
    "flat regions about x and y have also been found in the hole - quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "recently , wells et al.@xcite reported arpes measurements on the antiferromagnetic insulator @xmath106 .",
    "this material is very difficult to dope but the behavior of the quasiparticle at half - filling is important as a probe for the microscopic theories for holes in antiferromagnets that have been proposed .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite tried to fit their data with a @xmath107 model with @xmath108ev and found good agreement for the bandwidth but they could not fit the dispersion along the x - y line . in a recent paper nazarenko",
    "et al.@xcite suggested that the addition to the @xmath107 model of a @xmath0 hopping , which would be material dependent , could help to improve the fitting . using the born approximation they obtained agreement with experiments along the x - y line introducing a @xmath109 , with @xmath110 and @xmath108 ev .",
    "along the @xmath111 line disagreement with the experimental data remained although along this line a quasiparticle peak in the experiment is not clearly observed and the error bars are very large . using the sdw mean field approximation described in the appendix we calculated the dispersion and we tried to fit the experimental data . using @xmath5=10 and @xmath112 we found reasonable agreement with the experimental result as can be seen in fig.8 .",
    "these results confirm the importance of @xmath0 terms to describe the cuprates .    as it was stated in the introduction , one of the reasons often invoked to introduce a @xmath0 hopping in models for high @xmath20 superconductors is to match the shape of the fermi surface to experimental results or to lda calculations.@xcite the non - interacting hubbard model has a nested fermi surface ( fs ) at half - filling and it becomes large and electron - like immediately upon doping .",
    "the addition of a negative @xmath0 removes the nesting at half - filling and , instead , the fs becomes open and hole - like . upon further doping",
    "it eventually closes but it retains hole - like characteristics .",
    "it becomes electron - like only when the hole doping has been further increased.@xcite however , it is possible that the introduction of electronic interactions could modify substantially the non - interacting fs .",
    "for example , in the two dimensional hubbard model , the uniform magnetic susceptibility always decreases upon doping in the non - interacting case , but it increases when interactions are strong enough@xcite ( in agreement with experimental results ) .",
    "thus , it is very important to study how interactions affect the shape of the fs .",
    "since we work on finite lattices it is difficult to accurately determine the fs of a model .",
    "ideally , the fs should be obtained examining the spectral function @xmath82 . however , as we show in section vii presently the spectral functions can not be calculated with enough accuracy and alternative ways of determining the fs must be considered . in some previous papers@xcite the fs",
    "was obtained by calculating the position of the momenta where @xmath113 .",
    "this approach works well for weakly interacting systems , but it may cause problems when strong interactions are considered .",
    "one can imagine that for a system with a `` hole pocket '' centered at @xmath114 , @xmath115 along the @xmath116 line will jump from a value larger than 0.5 to zero as the pocket is encountered increasing the momentum away from @xmath117 , defining a first fermi surface , and then , at the second fs , it will increase again but to some value smaller than 0.5 .",
    "then the @xmath113 criterion is clearly incomplete in strong coupling because it may miss important structure .",
    "we can avoid this problem by assuming that a fs is likely to exist where the numerically obtained @xmath115 changes very rapidly .",
    "in fact , since experiments actually only detect crossovers in @xmath115 it is important to know where they occur in numerical simulations .",
    "thus , a study of the values of @xmath115 will shed light on possible changes in the shape of the fs as shown below .",
    "our mean field analysis predicts strong modifications in @xmath115 as @xmath5 increases at a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , at half - filling , fixed @xmath118 and large @xmath5 , @xmath115 resembles more the @xmath10 case with the same @xmath5 than the @xmath119 , @xmath120 case .",
    "this can be seen from eq.(9 ) in the appendix .",
    "if the gap between the conduction and the valence band is such that at half - filling the conduction band is completely filled and the valence band is empty , then @xmath115 is given by the same analytical expression as for the @xmath10 model .",
    "indeed , this is what we have observed with qmc . in fig.9-a",
    "we present @xmath115 along the line @xmath58 to @xmath59 , at half - filling for @xmath120 , 4 and 6 and @xmath75 .",
    "the mean field value along this line agrees with the exact result for @xmath10 ( @xmath121 ) for the finite values of @xmath5 studied .",
    "it appears that as @xmath5 increases with respect to @xmath122 , @xmath115 becomes more and more similar to the @xmath10 case , i.e. the concavity tends to disappear and the curve becomes flatter as @xmath5 increases which is very different from the non - interacting curve as can be seen in the figure .",
    "this result at half - filling is not unexpected since as @xmath5 increases , double occupancy decreases , the diagonal hopping becomes less relevant and the spin part of the model becomes effectively described by a nearest neighbor only heisenberg hamiltonian ( since @xmath123 for @xmath41 ) , i.e. the frustrating @xmath45 term is negligible .",
    "now let us study what happens away from half - filling . in fig.9-b , c and d , we present @xmath115 for the same parameters as in fig.9-a but for @xmath66 , 0.8 and 0.7 .",
    "we also show the corresponding mean field results ( open symbols ) for the interacting case .",
    "mean field results are expected to become less reliable as @xmath3 moves further away from 1 and antiferromagnetic correlations decrease . however , the mc points are always closer to the mean field values than to the non - interacting ones",
    ".    for negative @xmath0 , the low temperature mean field analysis predicts the formation of hole pockets upon doping about the @xmath114 point . on the other hand , in the non - interacting case",
    "the hole - like fs is centered about @xmath124 .",
    "in addition , in the mean field approximation at zero temperature there are crossovers in @xmath115 denoted by the crosses in fig.10-a where @xmath125 mean field results on a @xmath126 lattice at @xmath66 , @xmath75 and @xmath62 are presented .",
    "the full squares define the actual fs and the crosses signal the points where @xmath115 changes the most rapidly .",
    "the doted line indicates the points in momentum space where @xmath121 . notice that fig.10-a resembles the results obtained by aebi and collaborators,@xcite ( see fig.7 ) if we identify the points of maximum variation in @xmath115 with the experimental fs .",
    "as the temperature is increased within the mean field approximation the fermi surface around the pockets disappears@xcite and , instead , rapid crossovers are observed , i.e. , the solid squares in fig.10-a are replaced by crosses . for @xmath62",
    "the pockets remain observable up to @xmath127 .",
    "as the temperature increases to @xmath63 , i.e. , the value used in our monte carlo simulations , it can be seen in fig.10-b that the pockets about @xmath128 have disappeared and only the lines of crossovers remain .",
    "the open squares indicate the points where @xmath121 . then",
    ", the @xmath121 criterion applied to the mf data would incorrectly indicate a closed fs which does not resemble the actual fs at @xmath125 at all ! in fig.10-c",
    "we show the fs at @xmath125 for the non - interacting system . in this case",
    ", there is a jump in @xmath115 from 1 to 0 at the fs and the two criteria to determine its position agree . as the temperature increases to @xmath129 , fig.10-d , in the non - interacting case",
    ", both criteria still agree but a spurious crossover is induced along the direction @xmath130 due to temperature effects .",
    "however , this variation of @xmath115 is much smaller than along the directions where a fs exists at @xmath125 .    with this qualitative discussion in mind",
    "let us analyze our qmc results obtained on an @xmath48 lattice at @xmath79 using @xmath62 and @xmath75 .",
    "we will consider a system slightly doped away from half - filling with @xmath66 .",
    "the open squares in fig.10-e denote the points where @xmath113 while the crosses denote the regions of maximum variation of @xmath115 .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the mean field calculation on an @xmath48 lattice at the same temperature . also notice that this figure resembles fig.10-b where mean",
    "field results at the same temperature on a @xmath126 lattice are presented .",
    "now let us point out the differences with the non - interacting case shown in fig.10-f which is equivalent to fig.10-e but with u=0 .",
    "notice that the criterion @xmath113 , denoted by the open squares , provides a `` fermi surface '' identical to the one for the @xmath62 case ( fig.10-e ) .",
    "however , the position of the maximum variation of @xmath115 ( crosses ) is remarkably different.@xcite    then , one of the main results of this paper is that for intermediate and large values of the coulomb interaction it is @xmath131 to assume that the shape of the fermi surface is similar to the non - interacting one .",
    "the criterion of maximum variation of @xmath115 does not support such an assumption . in this case ,",
    "a better agreement is obtained when comparing numerical data with a sdw mean field calculation . according to this mean field approach , hole pockets about @xmath128",
    "should be observed at temperatures as high as @xmath132 .",
    "this result is in agreement with experiments for bi2212@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath62 in the interesting doping regimes ( @xmath133 ) , we are not able to obtain accurate results at temperatures lower than @xmath63 because the average value of the sign of the fermionic determinant becomes very small to directly verify the existence of hole pockets .    as a final comment",
    "we want to add that a study of the points where @xmath115 varies more rapidly for the @xmath10 hubbard model provides a result qualitatively similar to the one displayed on fig.10-e suggesting that a negative @xmath0 term may be dynamically generated.@xcite for positive @xmath0 hole pockets appear at @xmath90 , @xmath134 and symmetrical points .",
    "in this section we have measured @xmath115 numerically and we studied its behavior finding the points in momentum space where it changes more rapidly .",
    "the location of these points for negative values of @xmath0 determines a shape very similar to the one experimentally obtained in ref.@xcite where the fermi surface of bi2212 was studied .",
    "it is very important to understand how the introduction of @xmath0 affects the spectral function @xmath82 . to evaluate this quantity we used quantum monte carlo and the maximum entropy technique.@xcite in fig.11 we show @xmath82 for @xmath47 on an @xmath48 lattice , at @xmath135 , half - filling , and for @xmath10 ( fig.11-a ) and -0.2 ( fig.11-b ) . at half filling and @xmath10",
    "the chemical potential is located inside the gap .",
    "@xmath82 is the same along the line from @xmath9 to @xmath67 in agreement with the sdw mean field result and with the numerical observation showing that @xmath121 along this line .",
    "the size of the gap agrees with the result displayed in fig.5-d .",
    "when @xmath14 , as discussed in section iv , the gap is reduced and , within the accuracy of the maximum entropy procedure , only a pseudogap is observed ( fig.11-b ) .",
    "this again , is in agreement with the results presented in fig.5-e and with the sdw mean field calculations .",
    "also notice that the chemical potential does not lie inside the pseudogap .",
    "it is clear that the symmetry along @xmath92 has been removed .",
    "the study of the spectral function should , ideally , determine the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "this is done by observing the momenta where the quasiparticle peak crosses the chemical potential .",
    "the problem that we have observed with this approach is that the quasiparticle peak has a finite width which is rather large due to lack of accuracy of the maximum entropy technique .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath136 at which the peak starts moving across the chemical potential from the left is very different for the value of @xmath136 when the peak has finally moved completely to the right of the chemical potential , and this introduces large error bars . in fig.11-c",
    "we present the spectral function for @xmath137 , @xmath138 at @xmath66 and @xmath139 on an @xmath48 lattice . along the direction",
    "@xmath130 it can be seen that a broad quasiparticle peak moves across the chemical potential ; this would suggest the existence of a fermi surface in this direction as aebi et al.@xcite found but we can not determine accurately at what value of the momentum the actual crossing occurs . along the line @xmath140 there are indications that a fermi surface may exist very close to @xmath141 .",
    "these fermi surfaces would appear in the regions where we detected the largest variations of @xmath115 ( see fig.10-e ) .",
    "the determination of the fs through the study of the spectral function was used in ref.@xcite where the hubbard model with @xmath137 and @xmath142 was studied at @xmath139 on up to @xmath143 lattices .",
    "the conclusion is that , in this case , there is a closed fermi surface centered at @xmath52 . in fig.12",
    "we present the shape of the fermi surface that we obtained studying the problem on an @xmath144 lattice and using the criteria described in section vi .",
    "the @xmath145 criterion ( open squares ) gives an electron - like fermi surface closed about @xmath146 as previously observed in ref.@xcite but we have provided enough evidence that this criterion is not necessarily reliable .",
    "the points of rapid crossover in @xmath115 ( stars ) provide two surfaces , similar to the behavior predicted by the sdw mean field ( see appendix and section vi ) and the experimental data of ref.@xcite .    in the figure we also plot the results obtained from fig.1 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the full circles indicate the values of @xmath136 where the maximum of the quasi - particle peak crosses the chemical potential and the error bars correspond to the width of the peak .",
    "once the data of ref.@xcite are supplemented by the proper error bars , the results are consistent with those obtained with the maximum variation of @xmath115 criterion .",
    "however , due to the large error bars it is still not possible to decide whether the fermi surface is closed about @xmath147 or @xmath148 .    in this section",
    "we studied how a diagonal hopping @xmath0 added to the hubbard hamiltonian affects the behavior of the spectral function @xmath82 .",
    "we observed that in weak coupling ( @xmath5=4 ) the gap that appears at half - filling is reduced in agreement with the results presented in section iv .",
    "we found that the data are not accurate enough to allow the unique determination of the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath137 ) away from half - filling , we found indications of a fermi surface consistent with the one presented in section vi .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the 2d hubbard model with a diagonal hopping term in the intermediate coupling regime using monte carlo techniques .",
    "we observed that a diagonal hopping @xmath0 decreases the strength of spin - spin correlations .",
    "a negative diagonal hopping accelerates the onset of incommensurability while a positive one retards it .",
    "the intensity of the peak in the structure factor decreases rapidly as the system is doped away from half - filling but its strength may increase at lower temperatures . comparing our numerical results with experimental data for lsco , we found that a @xmath0 more negative than the suggested value@xcite -0.2 appears to be needed to reach quantitative agreement .",
    "we found that @xmath0 tends to reduce the size of the antiferromagnetic gap but this effect is important only in the weak coupling regime .",
    "double occupancy is enhanced ( reduced ) by a positive ( negative ) diagonal hopping .",
    "this effect does not occur in the non - interacting case .",
    "a study of @xmath115 allows us to define a new criterion to find probable locations of fermi surfaces working numerically at finite temperature .",
    "since experimentalists also work at finite temperature and find the fs as the points in momentum space where @xmath115 has rapid crossovers , we looked at these points in our numerical data .",
    "we observed that lines of rapid crossovers in @xmath115 appear in positions similar to the fs obtained experimentally at room temperature for bi2212@xcite .",
    "an analogous result is obtained for the @xmath10 case which indicates that a negative hopping term may be dynamically generated .",
    "a study of the spectral functions show how the addition of a diagonal hopping term removes the symmetry along the line @xmath92 and reduces the size of the gap at half - filling .",
    "we conclude that it is very dangerous to extract a bare parameter of the hamiltonian like @xmath0 from experimental ( pes ) data where renormalizaed parameters play the important role .",
    "we thank a. sandvik for providing his maximum entropy code and e.  dagotto , a.  kampf , q.  si , a.m.  tremblay and l.  chen for useful conversations and suggestions .",
    "this work is supported by the office of naval research under grant onr n00014 - 93 - 0495 and onr n00014 - 94 - 1 - 1031 .",
    "we thank scri and the computer center at fsu for providing us access to their cray - ymp supercomputer and also onr for giving us access to their cm5 connection machine .",
    "the spin density wave ( sdw ) mean field formalism has been applied to the hubbard model@xcite and also to the @xmath17 model@xcite . at half - filling the ground state for the @xmath17 model is antiferromagnetic if @xmath40 ; the critical coupling @xmath149 is a function of @xmath0 and for @xmath41 we found numerically @xmath150.@xcite since we will study u=4 or higher we want to concentrate in the antiferromagnetic solution . in this case",
