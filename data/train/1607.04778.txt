    "this completes the algorithm .",
    "flattening stratifications have been an important tool in theoretical algebraic geometry for over 50 years .",
    "there exist grbner basis techniques for computing flattening stratifications ; in the computational literature , these are typically called _ comprehensive _ or _ parametric grbner bases _ , or _ grbner systems_. the foundational work on this problem was begun by weispfenning , and many authors , including manubens and montes , suzuki and sato , nabeshima , and kapur , sun , and wang , have made important improvements on the original algorithm @xcite .",
    "the size of a grbner basis can grow very quickly with the number of variables and generators of an ideal , and unfortunately , even the most recent software can not compute flattening stratifications for the examples we consider . thus , in section [ partial flattening stratification section ] below , we discuss a strategy for circumventing this obstacle .",
    "many steps of algorithm [ main algorithm ] can be run using a computer algebra system , but even for modest examples , the flattening stratification required in the final step is intractable .",
    "therefore we discuss various heuristics that can be employed to speed the computation .      given a set of surface kernel generators , it is useful to discover as early as possible whether the corresponding riemann surface is hyperelliptic , trigonal , a plane quintic , or none of these .",
    "we discuss these properties in turn .",

    "@xmath0 is hyperelliptic if and only if @xmath3 contains a central involution with @xmath124 fixed points .",

    "additionally , we can use the algorithm described in @xcite to get the equations of @xmath126 under a linear series such as the transcanonical embedding or bicanonical embedding .",
    "so suppose the riemann surface is not hyperelliptic . by petri s theorem ,",
    "the canonical ideal is generated by quadrics if @xmath0 is not hyperelliptic , not trigonal , and not a plane quintic .",
    "thus , ruling out these possibilities allows us to work with quadrics instead of cubics , which significantly speeds up the algorithm .",
    "this leads us to consider trigonal riemann surfaces and plane quintics .    _ trigonal riemann surfaces . _",
    "trigonal riemann surfaces may be divided into two types : cyclic trigonal and general trigonal @xcite .",
    "cyclic trigonal curves can be detected by searching for degree three elements fixing @xmath127 points .",
    "their automorphism groups have been classified @xcite*theorem 2.1 , and one may hope for a paper treating equations of cyclic trigonal riemann surfaces as the paper @xcite treats equations of hyperelliptic riemann surfaces .",
    "less is known about general trigonal curves .",
    "we have arakawa s bounds @xcite*remark 5 and a few additional necessary conditions @xcite*prop . 4 and lemma 5 .",
    "we will not say more about general trigonal riemann surfaces here because after studying the riemann surfaces with large automorphism groups with genus @xmath128 , we learn _ a posteriori _ that very few of them are general trigonal .    _ plane quintics .",
    "_ plane quintics only occur in genus 6 , and the canonical model of a plane quintic lies on the veronese surface in @xmath129 .",
    "thus , we have a necessary condition : @xmath0 is a plane quintic only if @xmath130 for some ( possibly reducible ) three - dimensional representation @xmath71 of @xmath11 . in practice",
    ", it is generally quite fast to discover whether a nonhyperelliptic non - cyclic trigonal genus 6 riemann surface is a plane quintic .      in this section",
    "we use several notions from the theory of grbner bases .",
    "we will not recall all the definitions here , and instead refer to @xcite*chapter 15 for the details .",
    "the algorithms for comprehensive grbner bases described in section [ flattening stratification section ] all begin with the same observation .",
    "let @xmath131 $ ] be a polynomial ring over a field .",
    "let @xmath132 be a multiplicative term order on @xmath53 .",
    "then a theorem of macaulay states that the hilbert function of @xmath59 is the same as the hilbert function of its initial ideal with respect to this term order ( see @xcite*theorem 15.26 ) .",
    "therefore , whenever two ideals in @xmath53 have grbner bases with the same leading monomials with respect to some term order , they will have the same initial ideal for that term order , hence they must have the same hilbert function and hilbert polynomial , and therefore they will lie in the same stratum of a flattening stratification . to reach a different stratum of the flattening stratification ,",
    "it is necessary to alter the leading terms of the grbner basis  for instance , by restricting to the locus where that coefficient vanishes .",
    "here is a brief example to illustrate this idea . let @xmath133 have coordinates @xmath134 , and let @xmath135 have coordinates @xmath136,@xmath137,@xmath138,@xmath139 .",
    "the ideal @xmath140 defines a 2-parameter family of subschemes of @xmath135 . a grbner basis for @xmath59 in @xmath141[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]$ ] with respect to the lexicographic term order is @xmath142 over the locus where @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 are invertible , the initial ideal is + @xmath146 with hilbert polynomial @xmath147 . on the other hand , when @xmath148 , or @xmath149 , or @xmath150 , we get a different initial ideal and hilbert polynomial .",
    "for example , the locus @xmath151 yields the twisted cubic with @xmath152 .",
    "note that to discover this locus , it is not necessary to compute the entire grbner basis ; it would suffice for instance to compute the s - pair reduction for the first two generators , which yields @xmath153 .",
    "modern software packages by nabeshima , montes , and kapur , sun , and wang can completely analyze this example .",
    "however , these packages did not yield answers on the problems that arose in this work .",
    "therefore , i used the strategy outlined above .",
    "i partially computed a grbner basis in ` macaulay2 ` @xcite , and set some coefficients to zero . remarkably , this was sufficient to obtain the equations of the genus @xmath154 riemann surfaces with large automorphism groups .",
    "some of the families analyzed in this manner had as many as six coefficients @xmath155 .",
    "magaard , shaska , shpectorov , and vlklein s tables show that there exists a smooth , compact genus 7 riemann surface with automorphism group @xmath11 given by the group labeled @xmath156 in the gap library of small finite groups .",
