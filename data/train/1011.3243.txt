    "this section introduces quasicategories and the basic constructions one makes with them .",
    "we claim no originality , and all unattributed material is an account of the philosophy found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "homotopy theory can be regarded as the study of spaces up to homotopy equivalence .",
    "frequently , constructions in homotopy theory are only defined up to ( canonical ) homotopy equivalence , and are invariant up to homotopy equivalence .",
    "this motivates the construction of the _ homotopy category of spaces _",
    "@xmath2 : one takes a category of homotopically well - behaved spaces ( for example , the cw complexes , or the full subcategory of simplicial sets consisting of the kan complexes ) , and then identifies homotopic maps between any two spaces .",
    "the homotopy category is an extremely useful and important concept , in many regards , but there are also many aspects of homotopy theory that it fails to record faithfully .    for example , there is a natural notion of _ homotopy limits _ and _ colimits _ of spaces . while these have become established as extremely natural concepts in homotopy theory , philosophically comparable to other limits and colimits in category theory , they are not in fact limits and colimits in @xmath2 ( nor in any other category ) .    also , while the notion of a commutative monoid object in @xmath2  a space equipped with a product which is commutative and unital up to homotopy",
    " is an important one in the theory , it most usually appears as a shadow of a stronger notion , the notion of an @xmath0-monoid .",
    "this admits no natural category - theoretic description in terms of @xmath2 .    one can come to understand the problem as being the one - dimensionality of the category @xmath2 : as a category , it stores the equivalence classes of spaces , and also equivalence classes of maps , but it fails to record homotopies between maps , even though these can provide important , highly nontrivial information",
    ". it also fails to record homotopies between homotopies , and the general notion of _ higher homotopy_.      a method for dealing with this structure is offered by the language of _ higher category theory_.    this exists to study categories whose morphisms have some a notion of morphisms between them .    for example , categories themselves admit functors between them , and thus categories and functors together form a category .",
    "however , the functors have natural transformations between them , which form a higher level of structure .",
    "we say that categories , functors and natural transformations together form a _",
    "2-category _ , in which the categories are the _ objects _ or _",
    "0-cells _ , the functors are the _ morphisms _ or _ 1-cells _ , and the natural transformations are the _ 2-cells_.    @xmath3&\\bullet } \\hskip 2 cm \\xymatrix{\\bullet\\ar@/_1.8ex/[rr]\\ar@/^1.8ex/[rr]&\\downarrow&\\bullet}\\ ] ]    this can be extended : there are situations where one might want to consider a notion of _ 3-cells _ : morphisms between 2-cells .",
    "indeed , there are situations where it makes sense to talk of @xmath4-cells for every natural number @xmath4 : there should be a good notion of @xmath5-categories .",
    "a homotopy between continuous maps can certainly be regarded as a kind of morphism between them ; and higher homotopies could in turn be regarded as morphisms between homotopies .",
    "this makes the language of higher categories intrinsically relevant to topology .    however , there are problems .",
    "higher category theory is currently hard work : there are several competing definitions of higher categories , with an incomplete theory relating them @xcite .    on the other hand , the situations we are mostly interested in lack much of the generality that makes higher category theory difficult . in particular",
    ", homotopies are less general than 2-cells in an arbitrary higher category : every homotopy is invertible up to higher homotopies .",
    "we say that we are interested in _ @xmath6-categories _ ( meaning we have cells of every degree , but only the @xmath7-cells and @xmath8-cells need not be invertible up to homotopy ) . in practice we shorten this to _ @xmath9-categories _ where no confusion is possible .",
    "we recall that an ordinary category @xmath10 has a nerve @xmath11 , a simplicial set in which an @xmath4-cell corresponds to a string of @xmath4 composable morphisms of @xmath10 .",
    "the nerve is a functorial construction , and is an equivalence onto its image .",
    "it is standard to expect that , whichever definition of higher categories we use , there is a compatible notion of nerve .",
    "in fact , most definitions of higher categories are based on some explicit combinatorial geometric notion of cells , making an appropriate definition of the nerve readily available .    by its very definition",
    ", a simplicial set has consistently directed edges ( in the sense that higher simplices have their vertices totally ordered by the edges ) , but simplices have no other orientation data besides this .",
    "this means that , being unable to distinguish the direction of higher cells , a nerve is able to store only the data of an @xmath6-category .",
    "however , the nerve should be a complete invariant of @xmath6-categories , up to some appropriate notion of equivalence .",
    "the basic idea of _ quasicategories _ is to allow simplicial sets to model @xmath6-categories , by identifying them with their nerve .",
    "the problem then is to choose which simplicial sets should be selected as appropriate .",
    "we recall that nerves of ordinary categories are precisely those simplicial sets @xmath12 for which all inner horns @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) admit a unique extension to an @xmath4-simplex @xmath15 . here",
    "the simplicial set @xmath16 is the union of all faces of @xmath17 except the @xmath18th face . in the case of @xmath6-categories",
    ", it is unreasonable to demand uniqueness : there could be several lifts and some homotopy - theoretic interplay between them .",
    "for example , a chain of @xmath8-cells @xmath19 should certainly be composable to obtain a 2-cell .",
    "however , such composites ought to be parametrised by the collection of 2-cells from any such composite to itself : this may very well be nontrivial .    as a result",
    ", we can make our central definition ( following joyal @xcite , who himself followed cordier and porter @xcite , who themselves followed boardman and vogt @xcite ) : a _ quasicategory _ consists of a simplicial set @xmath10 such that any inner horn @xmath20 ( for @xmath14 ) admits an extension ( which is not necessarily unique ) to a full @xmath4-simplex @xmath21 .",
    "we adjust our nomenclature as part of a serious effort to treat these as a suitable setting for homotopy - theoretic category theory : an element of @xmath22 will be referred to as an _ object _ or _ element _ ; an element of @xmath23 will be referred to as a _ morphism _ , and an element in @xmath24 will be referred to as a _",
    "homotopy_.    we define a _ functor _ between two quasicategories to simply be a map of simplicial sets : the simplicity of this definition is an advert for quasicategories .",
    "an important special case is provided by the case of @xmath25-categories , also known as @xmath9-groupoids .",
    "these have the property that all @xmath18-cells for @xmath26 are invertible up to homotopy .",
    "notionally , it consists of @xmath7-cells , homotopies between @xmath7-cells , homotopies between homotopies between @xmath7-cells , and so on .",
    "the same analysis , in this situation , tells us that we should lift all horns , and therefore model @xmath9-groupoids by kan complexes .",
    "it is a classical fact that kan complexes provide a combinatorial model for spaces .",
    "this can be made compatible with our intuition : spaces consist of points , paths , paths between paths , and so on .",
    "another model for @xmath6-categories is provided by _",
    "topological categories _ : categories enriched in topological spaces ( or in kan complexes ) .",
    "the idea here is that an @xmath6-category may be viewed as a category enriched in @xmath25-categories : there is an @xmath25-category of cells ( the _ homspace _ ) between any two objects .",
    "this model is more intuitive in many situations , but it is frequently harder to use .",
    "it is common to use it on occasion ( we shall have occasion to use it later in this thesis ) ; and it is helpful to know that there is a good adjoint pair of comparison functors between quasicategories and categories enriched in kan complexes ( which , by considerable abuse of language , we call _ simplicial categories _ ) .    the hard work of the comparison rests in the fact that composition is strictly defined and even strictly associative in a simplicial category , but not in a quasicategory .    the comparison functors are defined using the help of a sequence of simplicial categories @xmath27 $ ] associated to any totally ordered set @xmath28 . the first one is @xmath29=*$ ] , the point . then @xmath30 $ ] consists of two objects labelled @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and a single point in the homspace from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .    @xmath31 $ ] has three objects , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "the homspaces are given by @xmath33(0,1)={\\mathfrak{c}}[012](1,2)=*,\\ ] ] and @xmath31(0,2)$ ] is the interval ( with one vertex given by the composite of the morphisms from @xmath7 to @xmath8 to @xmath32 ) .",
    "so this simplicial category is the simplicial category consisting of two composable morphisms , and another morphism homotopic to their composite .",
    "in general , we define @xmath27 $ ] to have object set @xmath28 , and morphisms given by : @xmath34(i , j ) =   \\begin{cases } \\emptyset , & \\text{if $ i > j$;}\\\\ * ,          & \\text{if $ i = j$;}\\\\ e(i , j )      & \\text{if $ i < j$. } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 consists of the ` indiscrete simplicial set ' whose objects are the subsets @xmath36=\\{k\\vert i\\leq k\\leq j\\}$ ] with @xmath37 ( that is , the nerve of the category with these objects and a single isomorphism between any two of them ) .",
    "this simplicial set can be viewed as a contractible cube of dimension equal to the number of elements of @xmath28 strictly between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "later we will write @xmath40 for the simplicial category @xmath41 $ ] .    now , using @xmath42 to denote the simplex on @xmath28 vertices",
    ", we can define the _ coherent nerve _",
    "@xmath43 of the simplicial category @xmath10 to be the simplicial set @xmath44,{\\mathcal{c}});\\ ] ] this simplicial set is shown in @xcite*1.1.5.10 to be a quasicategory .",
    "it is also shown there that the functor @xmath45 can be extended from the simplices @xmath42 to the whole category of simplicial sets , in order to provide a left adjoint to the coherent nerve functor .",
    "another popular approach to @xmath6-categories uses _ complete segal spaces _ , which are due to rezk @xcite .",
    "one notices that a category consists of a set of objects @xmath22 and a set of morphisms @xmath23 , equipped with certain maps between them .",
    "these maps can be characterised by saying that the objects @xmath46 form a simplicial set , where we define    @xmath47 here these defining maps already use the source and target maps @xmath48 , which are also the two face maps in degree 0 .",
    "of course , this is just a restatement of the nerve of a category .",
    "the key idea of a complete segal space is to generalise this : an @xmath6-category can have a @xmath25-category of objects and an @xmath25-category of morphisms .",
    "thus we model an @xmath6-category as a certain sort of bisimplicial set : one simplicial direction records the spaces representing these @xmath25-categories , and the other simplicial direction records the nerve - like structure , as described .",
    "this is defined in detail in @xcite , and it is shown by joyal and tierney @xcite that this approach is essentially equivalent to that of quasicategories .",
    "the point of view of complete segal spaces ( developed by barwick ) has also received recent attention in approaches by freed , hopkins and lurie to higher cobordism categories @xcite .",
    "having done some work to define these objects , it is sensible to ask for good examples . to start with",
    ", many finite simplicial sets are quasicategories ; these can do service as `` diagram quasicategories '' , but are usually of little interest in their own right .",
    "foremost among the more important examples is @xmath49 , the _ quasicategory of spaces_. this is most easily built indirectly : we take the simplicial category @xmath50 whose objects are kan complexes ( a natural model of spaces ) , and whose homspaces @xmath51 form the kan complex @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 .",
    "then we define @xmath54 .",
    "this quasicategory is a natural home for a good deal of homotopy theory and algebraic topology .",
    "more introspectively , there is a quasicategory @xmath55 of quasicategories .",
    "this can be defined in an analogous manner : we start from the simplicial category @xmath56 whose objects are quasicategories and where the homspaces @xmath57 consists of the maximal kan complex contained in @xmath58 ( there is a unique such complex ) .",
    "studying this is far from purely navelgazing : it will prove directly useful for many of the practical constructions in this thesis .    while frequently useful , @xmath55 does not encapsulate all the structure associated to quasicategories and functors between them .",
    "really , quasicategories should form an @xmath59-category . indeed , there is a notion of _ natural transformation _ between functors between quasicategories : a natural transformation between @xmath60 is a functor @xmath61 which restricts to @xmath62 and @xmath63 on @xmath64 respectively .",
    "on the other hand , passing to the maximal kan complex in @xmath58 is exactly the same as recording only the _ homotopies between functors _ : those natural transformations which are invertible up to homotopy .",
    "this gives us the maximal @xmath6-category contained in the @xmath59-category of quasicategories .",
    "some technology for using @xmath59-categories for this problem has been developed by lurie @xcite ; various other approaches by other authors are currently rumoured to be in preparation .",
    "much algebraic topology makes use of spaces only indirectly , preferring the language of _ spectra _ : these objects both represent generalised cohomology theories , and represent the features of spaces which can be detected by generalised cohomology .",
    "the classical introduction to the subject is @xcite .",
    "most traditional attempts to build models for the category of spectra proceed out of some direct motivation to localise the category of spaces by inverting the suspension functor ( since it is an isomorphism on generalised cohomology theories ) .",
    "lurie @xcite has demonstrated that one can build a quasicategory of spectra merely by inverting the suspension functor on the quasicategory of spaces in some formal way ; we make no direct use of this , but this quasicategory is known to be very close to some quasicategories we construct later .",
    "we now work to demonstrate some ways in which it is convenient to work with quasicategories : we imitate some standard category - theoretic constructions in this context .",
    "the first question is what it should mean for an object @xmath8 of a quasicategory to be a _ terminal object_. according to our motivating philosophy , this should mean some kind of `` homotopy terminal '' object : rather than demanding that the space of morphisms from any other object to @xmath8 be a point , we should demand that it be a `` homotopy point '' : in other words , that it be contractible .    in the language of simplicial categories",
    ", this would yield a workable definition as it stands .",
    "however , for quasicategories there is a pleasant alternative approach , which generalises to other limits more readily .",
    "we recall that in an ordinary category @xmath10 , the object @xmath8 is terminal if the forgetful functor @xmath65 is an equivalence ( where @xmath66 denotes the category of objects of @xmath10 over @xmath8 ) .    similarly , the diagram @xmath67 is a product diagram if the diagram of overcategories @xmath68 is an equivalence .",
    "we can imitate this if we can provide a workable quasicategorical definition of an overcategory .",
    "the intuition is that a diagram of shape @xmath69 over another diagram @xmath70 should just consist of a functor from some @xmath71 to @xmath10 .",
    "that simplicial set @xmath71 should contain copies of @xmath69 and @xmath1 ( with the copy of @xmath1 mapped as @xmath72 ) , together with simplices going from the copy of @xmath69 to the copy of @xmath1 , expressing the transformation from the diagram to @xmath72 .",
    "thus we define the join functor @xmath73 by @xmath74 in order to interpret this definition correctly , we must adopt the convention that @xmath38 or @xmath39 may attain the value @xmath75 , and that @xmath76 is a singleton .",
    "one should note that this is consistent with the convention that @xmath77 ; every simplicial set admits a unique map from the empty space .    in words ,",
    "an @xmath4-simplex of the join consists of two parts : the early vertices form a simplex in @xmath1 and the later vertices form a simplex in @xmath69 .    using this",
    "we can readily define an overcategory for any diagram in a quasicategory : if we have @xmath70 , then we define the overcategory @xmath78 by @xmath79    definitions of this sort will be seen frequently , and it is well worth spelling out how they work .",
    "we can recover an actual simplicial set from this formula .",
    "indeed , since @xmath80 , we plug in @xmath81 to get the @xmath4-simplices .",
    "the right - hand - side of the definition is naturally contravariantly functorial in @xmath12 so we can recover the simplical structure by plugging in the face and degeneracy maps between simplices .",
    "any such definition involves an implied claim ( usually obvious or immediate to check ) that , as a contravariant functor of @xmath12 , the morphisms from @xmath12 takes colimits to limits ; this is the unique property required to show that a functor represents a simplicial set .    in this case , it is normal to denote @xmath78 by @xmath82 when the map @xmath72 is obvious from the context .    using this definition",
    "we can say that an object @xmath8 is _ terminal _ in a quasicategory @xmath10 if , regarded as a homomorphism @xmath83 , the morphism @xmath84 is acyclic kan .",
    "moreover , we can easily define other limits .",
    "a _ cone _ in a quasicategory is a diagram @xmath85 ; it is a _",
    "limit cone _ if the morphism @xmath86 is acyclic kan .",
    "this can naturally all be dualised to define the _ undercategory _",
    "@xmath87 , _ initial objects _ , and _ colimits _ in general .",
    "to be explicit , the undercategory is defined by the formula @xmath88    in order to define adjunctions of quasicategories , we shall need a further idea ; to motivate it we recall the notion of a grothendieck fibration from ordinary category theory @xcite .",
    "these were defined in order to model categories of things depending on some parameter valued in another category .",
    "an example is the category of modules over some ring , where objects are pairs @xmath89 consisting of a ring and a module over it , and morphisms @xmath90 consist of a ring map @xmath91 and a module map @xmath92 .",
    "this category should be thought of as fibred over the category of rings .",
    "indeed , it admits a functor to the category of rings , and the preimage of any particular ring ( the _ fibre _ ) is the category of modules over that ring .",
    "moreover , the morphisms between modules over different rings encode the pullback of modules .",
    "so grothendieck fibrations over a category @xmath10 are defined as a special kind of functor @xmath93 .",
    "the definition is set up so that functors @xmath94 are equivalent to grothendieck fibrations over @xmath10 : the fibre over @xmath95 in @xmath96 is identified with the image category @xmath97 .",
    "we can imitate this theory perfectly in quasicategories .",
    "cocartesian fibration _ is a map of quasicategories @xmath98 which is :    * an _ inner fibration _ in the sense that , for every square like the following : @xmath99\\ar[r]&\\delta^n\\ar[d]{\\ar@{-->}}[dl]\\\\            { \\mathcal{e}}\\ar[r]_\\pi&{\\mathcal{c}}}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath14 ) there is a lifting as shown by the dotted arrow .",
    "* for any morphism @xmath100 in @xmath23 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 , there is a morphism @xmath103 with @xmath104 , and such that the map of undercategories @xmath105 is acyclic kan .",
    "the second part is a natural extension of the ordinary grothendieck fibration condition : it says more or less that any morphism @xmath106 out of @xmath12 in @xmath96 which has @xmath107 factoring through @xmath72 factors through @xmath62 in a manner which is unique up to homotopy .",
    "it is a theorem @xcite*section 3.2 that cocartesian fibrations over @xmath10 are equivalent to functors @xmath108 .",
    "we can dualise the definition of a cocartesian fibration , working with overcategories instead of undercategories , and obtain the definition of a _",
    "cartesian fibration _ ; these are equivalent to functors @xmath109 .    with this formalism",
    "there is an easy definition of _ adjunctions _ as maps of quasicategories @xmath110 which are simultaneously cartesian and cocartesian fibrations .",
    "regarded as the former , they define the functor @xmath111 ; regarded as the latter , they define the functor @xmath112 .    in the case where @xmath10 and @xmath113 are nerves of ordinary categories , we can assemble the appropriate fibration with ease ; it is an ordinary category over @xmath114 consisting of @xmath10 over @xmath7 , @xmath113 over @xmath8 , and for @xmath115 and @xmath116 we take @xmath117 .",
    "lastly , we make some remarks on homspaces of quasicategories .",
    "of course , one way to recover these is to use the adjoint @xmath45 to the coherent nerve functor , as described above , to produce a simplicial category , and then take a homspace of that .    in practice",
    ", however the adjoint @xmath45 is very unwieldy .",
    "often we need to study only one single homspace of a quasicategory ( rather than all of them at once ) .",
    "there are a number of tidy methods for doing this .",
    "our preference is to define @xmath118 by @xmath119 this is pleasingly symmetric in @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and quite tractable in practice .",
    "lurie @xcite has provided a notion of a symmetric monoidal quasicategory .",
    "a symmetric monoidal structure on @xmath10 is a cocartesian fibration @xmath122 over the category of based finite sets , such that the fibre over a based finite set @xmath123 is equivalent to @xmath124 , and such that the various morphisms @xmath125 model the projections @xmath126 .",
    "thus each based finite set @xmath123 , we have something equivalent to @xmath124 .",
    "given a map @xmath127 of based finite sets , a morphism over @xmath72 in @xmath128 represents the way to take products indexed by @xmath72 , to get from an @xmath12-indexed collection of objects of @xmath10 to a @xmath129-indexed collection .",
    "the theory is configured to be as lax as possible , and so it allows products to be defined only up to equivalence : a symmetric monoidal @xmath9-category @xmath10 admits a product functor @xmath130 , but this need only be defined up to equivalence .",
    "this represents the structure in a pleasing and malleable manner .",
    "however , this is not necessarily the optimal way of presenting the structure . in particular",
    ", this observation fails to take into account that a monoidal category has a natural diagonal @xmath131 , which interacts with the monoidal structure .",
    "the problem is not a novel one .",
    "lurie s definition is a way of importing the theory of @xmath0-algebras into the setting of @xmath6-categories .",
    "the language of operads , in general , does not permit reuse of variables : no axioms can be mentioned or theorems deduced with formulae which mention the same variable twice , and therefore one can not axiomatise the notion of a diagonal .",
    "a similar problem occurs when one tries to define a ring .",
    "the problem here is the distributive law : the right - hand side of the identity @xmath132 mentions the variable @xmath120 twice .",
    "there is a framework for classical universal algebra which does encompass this structure , that of _ algebraic theories_.    we will explain them with an example : indeed , a running example for us will be the theory of commutative monoids .",
    "one forms a category @xmath133 whose objects are finite sets , and where the morphisms @xmath134 are the morphisms between the free commutative monoid @xmath135 on @xmath136 and the free commutative monoid @xmath137 on @xmath138 .",
    "we will write @xmath139 for the generators of @xmath135 , and @xmath140 for the generators of @xmath137 .",
    "then a map from @xmath135 to @xmath137 sends each @xmath141 to a word in the @xmath142 .",
    "such a word can be represented by a finite set with a map to @xmath138 ( considered up to isomorphism ) : the number of elements over an element of @xmath138 describes the number of occurrences of that element in the word .",
    "we need to give a word for every element of @xmath136 ; this corresponds to a set with a map to @xmath136 and to @xmath138 : the preimage of an element in @xmath120 determines a set over @xmath138 representing the appropriate word .",
    "thus such a map is determined by an isomorphism class of sets over both @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "we revisit these ideas in section [ homs - in - span ] .",
    "it is simple to check that the composite of the maps represented by @xmath143 and @xmath144 is represented by the pullback of @xmath12 and @xmath129 along  @xmath138 , along with the canonical maps to @xmath136 and @xmath145 factoring through @xmath12 and @xmath129 respectively .",
    "this turns out to have the property that the category of product - preserving functors @xmath146 is equivalent to the category of monoids : given such a functor , we obtain a monoid @xmath147 by taking the image of the singleton set .",
    "the homset @xmath134 parametrises the maps which the theory of monoids forces to exist between @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "given other classes of algebraic objects @xmath147 whose axioms involve merely maps from @xmath148 to @xmath149 , we can follow the same prescription of forming a category whose objects are finite sets and whose homsets are morphisms between the finitely generated free objects on those sets . then",
    "product - preserving functors from that category into @xmath150 will be models of these axioms .",
    "see @xcite for a precise statement .",
    "detailed references for algebraic theories are @xcite .",
    "work of badzioch @xcite involves studying a topological analogue of algebraic theories .",
    "however , the notions of algebraic theory that he uses are not as lax as can be . as a result",
    ", he is able to recognise generalised eilenberg - maclane spaces ( spaces of the homotopy type of a topological abelian group ) using his theories , rather than the laxer notion of an @xmath0-space",
    ".    one might attempt to define an algebraic theory for @xmath0-spaces as follows : given a set @xmath12 , consider the free @xmath0-space @xmath151 on @xmath12 .",
    "for the sake of the present argument , we choose to model this as the classifying space of the symmetric monoidal category @xmath152 , whose underlying category is the groupoid of sets and isomorphisms over @xmath12 .",
    "this can be thought of as modelling the free symmetric monoidal category on generators indexed by @xmath12 : these generators are the inclusions @xmath153 for @xmath154 .    giving a monoidal functor from @xmath152 to @xmath155",
    "essentially consists of specifying the destination of each generator : for each @xmath154 , we give a set over @xmath129 .",
    "similarly to before , this is exactly the data of a diagram @xmath156 .",
    "we call such diagrams _ span diagrams_. the novel feature , compared to before , is that we are not passing to isomorphism classes .",
    "this suggests we should be interested in the weak 2-category where 0-cells are finite sets , 1-cells from @xmath12 to @xmath129 are span diagrams @xmath156 , and 2-cells are isomorphisms of span diagrams , in the natural sense .    by this process",
    "we obtain a natural model for monoidal quasicategories , and algebras in them .",
    "this is equivalent to lurie s theory , and so equivalent to the older theory of @xmath0-monoids in spaces .",
    "we then study the analogous theory for semirings , producing a model for @xmath0-semirings .",
    "we also study grouplikeness , and so obtain a model for @xmath0-groups , and @xmath0-ring spaces .",
    "firstly , previous models have tended to put the additive and multiplicative structure of an @xmath0 ring space on very different footings .",
    "the classical topological operad pair uses the little discs operad for the additive structure and the linear isometries operad for the multiplicative structure .",
    "these are very different operads : there is no map between them , and so any comparison between their algebras discards all the geometric significance .    in this regard , the various categories of connective strictly commutative ring spectra fare no better : the additive structure is encoded by the spectrum data , but the multiplicative structure is given explicitly .",
    "even lurie s handling of the matter ( representing an @xmath0-algebra as an algebra object in the quasicategory of algebras in the quasicategory of spaces ) still has two distinct stages .",
    "even if the machinery used at each stage is identical , the input for the first stage is of a different kind to the input for the second .",
    "on the other hand , our model treats the additive and multiplicative structures analogously and simultaneously , and so one can neatly perform constructions which mix them . one application , described in section [ components - and - units ] , is a pleasant construction of @xmath157 of an @xmath0 ring space : this should be an @xmath0-monoid , thought of additively , but the old models can only naturally give you one with an action of the multiplicative @xmath0-operad .",
    "lastly , we give a tidy conceptual definition of the @xmath1-theory of structured categories .      while the whole department of pure mathematics combined to make the university of sheffield a fantastic and friendly place for me to work , i must single out several of its members .",
    "most importantly , i would like to thank neil strickland , who has been an inspiring supervisor , a constant help , and a good friend while i was writing this thesis .",
    "i am extremely grateful to him ; this phd could not have been without him .",
    "it was david gepner who first suggested i look at quasicategories , and this turned out to be pivotal .",
    "he has offered strong encouragement to me at many points .",
    "john greenlees spent much time struggling to enable me to come to sheffield , for which i am very grateful ; he continued to help me as a colleague and as head of department while there .",
    "besides sheffield s financial support , i am also happy to acknowledge extremely generous funding from the sims fund of the university of cambridge .",
    "fellow sheffield mathematicians rajender adibhatla , bruce bartlett , tony hignett , and panagiotis tsaknias lived with me for two years in the house of maths and took turns absorbing bad behaviour and bad mathematical ideas ; zacky choo and harry ullman took the easy option of a year each .",
    "i ve had fascinating conversations , all too brief , with andrew baker , david barnes , bruce bartlett , clark barwick , nathan bowler , eugenia cheng , john greenlees , ian grojnowski , tony hignett , andrey lazarev , tom leinster , jacob lurie , john rognes , alex shannon , johann sigurdsson , vic snaith , andy tonks , sarah whitehouse , simon willerton , and certainly many more people besides .    from among people who are nt mathematicians ,",
    "i ve also been blessed with too many tremendous friends to count , who have succeeded in keeping me very happy indeed .",
    "the first aiders of cambridge and sheffield universities have given me a great hobby . of the countless dozens of others , i should mention and thank in particular nic and ogg cranch , john eaton , jo harbour , tom jackman and charlotte squires - parkin .",
    "lastly , i should thank my parents , whose rle in making it possible for me to write this thesis goes far beyond the obvious .",
    "i thus dedicate this thesis to my father , david donald cranch , who has steadily and lovingly encouraged my interest in mathematics from the very beginning .",
    "the first aim of this section is to compare various notions of 2-category , in order to match jacob lurie s definition of a 2-category @xcite with the classical notions .",
    "there are several classical notions , with varying levels of strictness and laxity : as might be expected , it is simpler to construct the laxer versions , and simpler to use the stricter versions in constructions . at one end is the notion of a weak 2-category , and at the other is the notion of a strict 2-category @xcite .",
    "there is little essential difference , insofar as the work of street and his coauthors @xcite ( proved also in @xcite ) says that any weak 2-category can be replaced with an equivalent strict 2-category .",
    "a strict 2-category is exactly the same thing as a category enriched in categories , and we use this identification in what follows .",
    "the second aim is to prove some basic results on quasicategories , which will be useful later on .",
    "we use quasicategorical terminology without apology , even for arbitrary simplicial sets .",
    "thus a 0-cell will often be called an _ object _ of a simplicial set , and a 1-cell",
    "will often be called a _",
    "morphism_.    accordingly , when we use the word `` space '' , we mean kan complex .",
    "let @xmath10 be a strict 2-category with all 2-cells invertible ( that is , a category enriched in groupoids ) .",
    "we can define its nerve in two steps .",
    "first we form a simplicial category @xmath159 with @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "this is a category enriched in kan complexes , and is thus suitable for the coherent nerve construction described in @xcite , giving as our final definition that @xmath162 .",
    "it is worth expanding this definition a little .",
    "we recall the definition of the simplicial categories @xmath40 from @xcite*1.1.5 ( we also defined them in [ quasicategory - comparisons ] ) , then @xmath163 .",
    "this lets us prove :    an @xmath4-cell in @xmath164 consists of    * an @xmath165-tuple @xmath166 of objects of @xmath10 , * morphisms @xmath167 of @xmath10 for all @xmath168 , * 2-cells @xmath169 of @xmath10 for all @xmath170 ,    such that for any @xmath171 there is an identity on 2-cells : @xmath172    as @xmath173 , a map of simplicial categories @xmath174 certainly distinguishes objects @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath7-simplices of homspaces of @xmath175 correspond to subsets of the interval @xmath176 containing both @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and composition is by disjoint union .",
    "thus they are generated under composition by the minimal subsets @xmath177 .",
    "these give us the morphisms @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath8-simplices of homspaces of @xmath175 correspond to ( the opposites of ) inclusions of pairs of subsets of @xmath176 containing both @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these are generated by inclusions @xmath178 under horizontal and vertical composition , providing the maps @xmath169 of @xmath10 .",
    "the interchange law for horizontal and vertical composition gives us the specified identity , arising from the agreement of the composite inclusions @xmath179 this identity generates all @xmath32-cells in @xmath175 , under composition .",
    "as @xmath180 is the nerve of a groupoid , a map @xmath175 is uniquely specified by its effect on the 1-skeleton , so there are no further data or identities .",
    "we refer to the identity as the _ compatibility condition _ , and since 2-cells are invertible we can write it graphically : it says that the pasting of the following diagram is the identity 2-cell .",
    "@xmath181\\ar@/^16pt/[rr]_{\\uparrow}\\ar@/_26pt/[rrr]^{\\downarrow}\\ar@/^26pt/[rrr]_{\\uparrow}&x_1\\ar[r]\\ar@/_16pt/[rr]^{\\downarrow}&x_2\\ar[r]&x_3}\\ ] ]    we also get the following basic coherence result , which is obvious from the description above .    a lax functor @xmath111 between bicategories with all 2-cells invertible yields ( via passing to strict 2-categories ) a map of quasicategories @xmath182 between their nerves .",
    "we can replace @xmath62 with an equivalent functor of strict 2-categories , and then use the naturality of the nerve construction considered above .",
    "also , this construction agrees with the construction of the nerve of a category .",
    "let @xmath10 be a category , regarded as a bicategory with only identities for 2-cells .",
    "then @xmath11 is the ordinary nerve of @xmath10 .",
    "now , the nerve @xmath11 should be thought of as a model for @xmath10 in the world of quasicategories .",
    "thus , we should expect it to be a ( 2,1)-category in the sense discussed above .",
    "this means that all all extensions of maps @xmath20 to @xmath18-cells are unique for @xmath183 : its cells in degrees 3 and over are determined by those in lower degrees .",
    "the facts support our intuition :    [ nerves - of - bicats ] the nerve @xmath11 is a @xmath158-category .",
    "suppose given an inner horn inclusion @xmath184 for @xmath183 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we can recover all the 1-cells from this data : the 1-cell @xmath185 for @xmath168 will be given by the face numbered @xmath186 for any @xmath187 .    if @xmath188 , then without loss of generality , @xmath189 ( as the case @xmath190 is dealt with in a symmetric manner ) .",
    "we then have the following diagram : @xmath181\\ar@/^16pt/[rr]_{\\uparrow}\\ar@/_26pt/[rrr]^{\\downarrow}&x_1\\ar[r]\\ar@/_16pt/[rr]^{\\downarrow}&x_2\\ar[r]&x_3}\\ ] ] this leaves us just missing the 2-cell @xmath191 .",
    "but , since all 2-cells are invertible , we can take this to be the composite of all the 2-cells in the diagram above . in symbols , we define @xmath192 and this clearly fulfils the compatibility condition .",
    "this choice is clearly forced , arising as it does by solving the compatibility condition for @xmath193 , and this means the extension is unique .",
    "if @xmath194 , then all 2-cells are determined uniquely ( indeed , @xmath195 will be defined by face @xmath186 , for any @xmath196 ) . however , if @xmath197 there are some compatibility conditions which are not forced by the faces , and we must check that they hold .    for calculations ,",
    "we omit the identity parts of our 2-cells .",
    "then all composites are vertical composites , so we do not bother writing the @xmath198 .",
    "there are five compatibility conditions coming from the faces : @xmath199 also , @xmath200 and @xmath201 commute .",
    "we can see this using the interchange law : @xmath202    for horn inclusions @xmath203 , we have all coherence conditions except the one arising from face 1 , and must show that from the others .",
    "but we have : @xmath204    for horn inclusions @xmath205 , we have all coherence conditions except the one from face 2 .",
    "similarly , we have : @xmath206    horn inclusions @xmath207 can be dealt with by an argument symmetric to that used for horn inclusions @xmath208 .    the fact that all structure is determined means that the extension is unique .",
    "if @xmath209 , then nothing need be checked : the compatibility conditions on @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 will be fulfilled by face @xmath186 , for any @xmath214 .    using this nerve construction , in the sequel we shall abuse terminology systematically , and confuse a strict 2-category with its nerve @xmath158-category .      in this section",
    "we prove some properties of lurie s model for @xmath215-categories , from @xcite*subsection 2.3.4 : these are those @xmath6-categories which admit all inner horn extensions @xmath216 uniquely where @xmath217 .",
    "it follows immediately from the definition @xcite*2.3.4.9 that an @xmath215-category has at most one extension along @xmath218 for @xmath217 ; here s a strengthening of that statement :    [ partial - delta - n - cat ] an @xmath215-category @xmath10 has unique liftings for @xmath218 where @xmath219 .",
    "we can restrict the map @xmath220 to a map @xmath221 , and lift that uniquely to a map @xmath222 .",
    "this is the only candidate for a lifting ; we must prove that it is compatible with the given map on all of @xmath223 : that is , show that it agrees on the @xmath8st face .",
    "but these two @xmath224-cells certainly agree on the boundary of the @xmath8st face ( which is isomorphic to @xmath225 ) and thus agree .    in a similar vein",
    "is this :    [ outer - horn - n - cat ] an @xmath215-category @xmath10 has unique liftings for outer horns @xmath226 and @xmath227 where @xmath228 .    we can uniquely extend a map @xmath229 to a map @xmath220 using proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] on the @xmath7th face .",
    "then we can uniquely extend that to a map @xmath222 using proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] again .",
    "the case of @xmath230 is symmetrical .",
    "the special case of ordinary categories will be of utility later :    [ nerve - outer - horns ] the nerve of a category @xmath231 has unique liftings for outer horns @xmath232 and @xmath233 whenever @xmath194 .",
    "the following proposition reduces the work necessary to show that a map of @xmath215-categories is an acyclic kan fibration :    [ acyclic - kan ] a functor @xmath234 of @xmath215-categories automatically has the right lifting property with respect to the maps @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] gives a map @xmath222 , and by @xcite*2.3.4.9 , this is consistent with the given map @xmath235 .",
    "we can say useful things about inner fibrations .",
    "let @xmath111 be a functor between @xmath215-categories .",
    "we have the following simple criterion for being an inner fibration :    [ inner - fibs ] the functor @xmath62 is an inner fibration if and only if it has the right lifting property for inner horns @xmath236 for @xmath237 .",
    "in particular , this gives the following simple criterion for @xmath158-categories : @xmath62 is an inner fibration if , for every pair of diagrams @xmath238^h&\\\\            x\\ar[ur]^f&&z } } \\text{in $ { \\mathcal{c}}$,\\hskip 1 cm and } \\vcenter { \\xymatrix{&y'\\ar[dr]^{h'}{\\ar@{=>}}^{k'}[d]&\\\\            x'\\ar[ur]^{f'}\\ar[rr]_{g'}&&z ' } } \\text{in $ { \\mathcal{d}}$,}\\ ] ] such that @xmath239 and @xmath240 , there is a 1-cell @xmath241 and 2-cell @xmath242 such that @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we now switch our attention to the more intricate notion of a cartesian fibration .",
    "these are analogues of the classical notion of a grothendieck fibration of categories .",

    "a cocartesian fibration describes a family of quasicategories varying covariantly functorially over a base quasicategory .",
    "given @xmath245 , a cocartesian morphism in @xmath10 is a cartesian morphism for @xmath258 , and @xmath253 is a cocartesian fibration if @xmath259 is a cartesian fibration .",
    "lurie proves that overcategories of @xmath215-categories are @xmath215-categories @xcite*lemma 1.2.17.10 . the class of @xmath215-categories is not closed under fibre products . but",
    "the following lemma does most of the work for us :    the class of simplicial sets which are the coskeleton of their @xmath18-skeleton is closed under all limits .",
    "the @xmath4-skeleton functor @xmath260 visibly preserves limits , and the @xmath4-coskeleton functor preserves limits since it is right adjoint to @xmath260 .",
    "given this , this category is closed under limits .",
    "indeed , more is true :    for any @xmath261 , the class of simplicial sets with unique liftings for maps @xmath262 is closed under limits .",
    "the class of such simplicial sets is closed under products since a lifting for the product is just the product of liftings of the factors ; we ll verify it for fibre products too .",
    "so if @xmath12 , @xmath129 and @xmath263 are simplicial sets with unique extensions for the map @xmath262 , then i claim that @xmath264 has unique liftings for it too . indeed ,",
    "a map @xmath265 consists of maps @xmath266 whose composites with the maps from @xmath12 and @xmath129 to @xmath263 agree .",
    "these extend uniquely to maps @xmath267 .",
    "their composites with the maps to @xmath263 are both extensions of our map @xmath268 .",
    "but such extensions are unique , and so they agree .",
    "thus these maps assemble to a unique extension @xmath269 .",
    "these combine to prove the following :    let @xmath245 be a map between @xmath215-categories .",
    "a morphism @xmath100 in @xmath23 is @xmath253-cartesian if and only if the morphism @xmath270 has the right lifting property for all maps @xmath271 for @xmath272 .    by the results above , both sides are @xmath215-categories",
    "; we thus apply proposition [ acyclic - kan ] to show the higher lifting conditions are automatic .",
    "we prove some results about joyal s construction of overcategories , described in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we study the naturality of overcategories . recall that , given a map @xmath70 of simplicial sets , the overcategory @xmath78 is defined up to isomorphism by the property that @xmath273 is defined to be the collection of diagrams @xmath274^i\\ar[dr]_{f}&x\\star k\\ar[d]\\\\                                & { \\mathcal{c}},}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the natural inclusion of @xmath1 into @xmath275 . this is indeed a valid definition of @xmath78",
    "; we re describing a functor @xmath276 , which takes colimits to limits .",
    "thus we get a simplicial set : the @xmath4-simplices are obtained by evaluating on @xmath17 .    we need to study iterating the construction of overcategories .    given a map @xmath277 ( which corresponds to a map which we denote @xmath278 )",

    "we study the relationship between joyal s over construction ( described in @xcite*lemma 1.2.9.2 ) , and limits of simplicial sets .",
    "the result is that taking overcategories commutes with taking limits of simplicial sets , in the following sense :    [ limits - and - overs ] suppose we have an ( ordinary ) finite category @xmath284 , to be thought of as a diagram category , and a diagram @xmath285 .",

    "we detour for a moment to show how an edge @xmath100 in a quasicategory @xmath10 yields a morphism of overcategories @xmath296 .",

    "( to prove this , it is quick to verify that the essential image of @xmath604 in @xmath601 satisfies the colimit property , and is thus all of it )",
    ".    however , any @xmath605 is the essential image of some @xmath606 .",
    "also , there is an equivalence ( induced by the image of the 2-cell @xmath607 in @xmath55 ) between the image of @xmath120 and the image of @xmath136 in @xmath601 .",
    "so every structure map has the same essential .",
    "we start with @xmath608 .",
    "we can transfinitely enumerate the finite product diagrams in the quasicategory @xmath444 as @xmath609 for some ordinal @xmath610 , where @xmath611 is a discrete simplicial set , and @xmath612 .",
    "we choose to do this with redundancy : we want each individual product diagram to appear infinitely many times and be cofinal in @xmath610",

    ". then we proceed by transfinite induction , extending to limit ordinals by taking the filtered colimits ( in @xmath55 ) of the preceding quasicategories : @xmath623    the resulting quasicategory @xmath624 is our colimit .",
    "we have several checks to make to show this to be the case .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to show we havent enlarged our quasicategory in an unacceptable manner :    all the structure maps @xmath625 for @xmath626 are essentially surjective .",
    "proof of claim it suffices to show both that the successor maps @xmath627 are essentially surjective , and also that a colimit of shape @xmath5 of essentially surjective maps is essentially surjective .    a similar argument works for both .",
    "we can show for each that a failure to be essentially surjective would violate the universal property : that the image of the morphism would provide a smaller object with the same property .    indeed ,",
    "if @xmath627 was not essentially surjective , the image @xmath628 would result in the nontrivial factorisation @xmath629 and the left - hand map can easily be checked to be a product cone .",
    "this contradicts the universal property of the adjunction .",
    "similarly , if a colimit @xmath630 of essentially surjective maps of quasicategories is not essentially surjective , then the essential image factors the structure maps of the colimit nontrivially , which contradicts the universal property of the colimit .",
    "secondly , we need to show it is indeed a theory , and that the structure maps we ve defined are maps of theories .",
    "we ve done essential surjectivity already , so we just need the following :    the defined maps @xmath631 preserve all finite products .",
    "proof of claim given a limit cone @xmath632 , we must show that the composite @xmath633 is a limit cone too . given a lifting problem for a cofibration @xmath634 as follows : @xmath342\\ar[d]&\\delta^n\\ar[d]{\\ar@{-->}}[dl]\\\\            ( x_\\kappa)_{/(1\\star d)}\\ar[r]&(x_\\kappa)_{/d},}\\ ] ] we rewrite it as @xmath635\\ar[dr]&\\delta^n\\star 1\\star d{\\ar@{-->}}[d]\\\\            & x_\\kappa.}\\ ] ]",
    "since the simplicial set @xmath636 is finite , the map from it to @xmath624 factors through some @xmath637 for which @xmath638 is a product cone ( since , by construction , the set of such ordinals @xmath613 is cofinal in @xmath610 ) .",
    "the required extension exists in that @xmath637 and thus also in @xmath624 .",

    "@xmath624 is universal among theories under @xmath62 .",

    "now , in case @xmath341 , we have compatible functors @xmath645 and @xmath646 , with the middle @xmath8 sent to @xmath624 .",
    "equivalently , this is a diagram @xmath647 and we need to extend it to @xmath648 .",
    "since @xmath616 is the colimit of @xmath62 , we can extend this the underlying diagram @xmath649 to a diagram @xmath650 , with the middle @xmath8 sent to @xmath616 . using the universal property of the adjunction and the colimiting property",
    ", we can extend this to a map @xmath651 , where @xmath652 denotes the nerve of the ordinal @xmath653 viewed as a poset ( that is , as the poset of ordinals less than or equal to @xmath610 ) , and where the ordinal @xmath613 is sent to @xmath637 .",
    "the terminal vertex of @xmath652 and the initial vertex of @xmath405 are both sent to @xmath624 . moreover , by construction , they are identical under @xmath62 , and so by construction the edge between them is the identity .",
    "restriction to @xmath654 thus gives us the required diagram in @xmath55 ; since all the edges were present already and were morphisms of @xmath447 , this is also a diagram in @xmath447 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we can do similar things with this method :    [ cinftypp - cocomplete ] the quasicategory @xmath469 of quasicategories with all finite products , and product - preserving functors between them , has colimits .",
    "the proof of the preceding proposition generalises in a straightforward manner . since our diagrams are no longer cones of essentially surjective maps under @xmath444 , we need to consider products in all the diagrams and force their images to all be products ( whereas before it sufficed to consider only those in @xmath444 ) .",
    "we no longer need to ensure essential surjectivity , but we do however need to provide limits for all the new objects introduced .",
    "so we intersperse the operations which force cones to be product cones with operations that adjoin new products for the objects ( using the methods of @xcite*5.3.6 ) .",
    "free models for a theory are shown to exist by proposition [ models - pushforward ] ; this section records a more explicit , less involved construction of free models on finite sets .",
    "let @xmath402 be a theory .",
    "we suppose given a functorial model @xmath655 for the homspaces in @xmath402 .",
    "such models are shown to exist and are discussed further in @xcite*section 1.2.2 .",
    "the structure map @xmath443 is equivalent to a functor @xmath656 , and we can compose this with the homspace functor to get a map @xmath657 in other words , we take @xmath658 .    the functor @xmath659 is product - preserving since @xmath660 is , so we actually get a functor @xmath661    this behaves as we would hope :    the functor @xmath659 is indeed the free model of @xmath402 on @xmath12 .    for any model @xmath136 of @xmath402 , we have a natural equivalence @xmath662 this is a straightforward exercise using the quasicategorical yoneda lemma of @xcite*section 5.1 .    in particular , this agrees with the more general construction of proposition  [ models - pushforward ]",
    ".    we can also prove :    a theory @xmath402 is equivalent to the opposite of the full subquasicategory of @xmath450 on the free models on finite sets .",
    "the yoneda embedding used above is full and faithful ; and the functor is evidently essentially surjective on objects .",
    "in this section we introduce a quasicategory @xmath663 , a theory for commutative monoid objects , and we study its properties .",
    "we first motivate this by explaining the failure of the most naive approach .",
    "given a collection of objects in a commutative monoid , we can define operations which form more objects by adding some copies of the originals .",
    "here is an example of such an operation : @xmath664 indeed , since addition of finite collections is the only operation in a commutative monoid , we rather expect that all operations natural in the monoid should take this form .",
    "but we should find out how to describe operations in this form in general .",
    "we are adding up some copies of the things we started with .",
    "we can regard this as a two - stage process : first we make copies , then we add .",
    "so we can factor this operation as @xmath665    in general we can associate natural operations on a monoid @xmath147 to maps of finite sets :    * given a map @xmath666 of sets , we can produce a _ copying _ map @xmath667 via @xmath668 . *",
    "given a map @xmath669 of sets , we cap produce an _ addition _",
    "map @xmath670 via @xmath671 .    of course ,",
    "we can compose these , and so given any diagram of finite sets @xmath672 we get an operation @xmath673 , which sends @xmath674 via @xmath675    we refer to a diagram of this shape as a _ span diagram_. it certainly seems natural to suggest that span diagrams should give all the natural operations on a commutative monoid .",
    "however , span diagrams @xmath676 and @xmath677 yield identical operations if they are isomorphic in the sense that @xmath678\\ar[dd]^\\wr&\\\\ x\\ar[ur]\\ar[dr]&&y\\\\ & y'\\ar[ur]&}\\ ] ] commutes .",
    "moreover , we can compose span diagrams : we use pullbacks : @xmath679\\ar[dr]&\\\\x&&y}}\\right ) \\circ \\left(\\vcenter{\\xymatrix@r-8pt@c-16pt{&v\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&\\\\y&&z}}\\right ) =   \\left(\\vcenter{\\xymatrix@r-8pt@c-16pt{&u{\\mathop{\\times}_{y}}v\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&\\\\x&&z}}\\right).\\ ] ] it can quickly be checked that this is the right thing to do , using the formula above for @xmath673 .",
    "these span diagrams thus form a category @xmath680 .",
    "hence it is reasonable to believe that this is the theory of commutative monoids , and in fact this is a classical result .",
    "we might aim to apply this to homotopy theory : badzioch @xcite has shown that the models of @xmath680 in @xmath49 are exactly the generalised eilenberg ",
    "mac lane spaces .",
    "his paper works in ordinary category theory , but a note observes that all results carry through in the world of simplicial categories",
    ".    we might hope for a different theory : frequently , a more useful notion of commutative monoid in @xmath49 is the notion of @xmath0-monoid @xcite .",
    "this is a monoid which is commutative only up to coherent homotopy .",
    "so we might ask , how might we change @xmath680 in order to get this more nuanced theory ?    to find an answer , we must realise that we lose valuable information when we pass to isomorphism classes of span diagrams to form the category @xmath680 .",
    "in particular , multiplying two elements in an @xmath0-monoid corresponds to the span diagram @xmath681 this span diagram has a nontrivial automorphism , exchanging the @xmath8 and @xmath32 in the central part of the span .",
    "this is important : without it , there is only one way to do the multiplication .",
    "however , with it , and with the homotopies induced by the automorphism , we hope there would be a space of ways of multiplying two elements which is contractible but has a free @xmath682-action , as is required by a @xmath0-monoid action .",
    "our task therefore is to build an object like @xmath680 but which remembers the automorphisms of span diagrams .      throughout this subsection",
    "we assume given a canonical , functorial choice of pullbacks of finite sets .",

    "so , in this notation , our category @xmath683 is @xmath694 .",

    "composition is then matrix multiplication , and it is easily seen that coproducts and products are given on homspaces by block sums of matrices .",

    "we wish to study the notion of distributivity : our chief motivation is to be able to describe rings as consisting of a multiplicative monoid , and an additive group , such that the multiplicative structure distributes over the additive .      without even having constructed the classical theory of semirings ,",

    "for example :",
    "@xmath1059 however , one axiom we impose on semirings is the distributive law . in the above morphism",
    ", that means we can replace @xmath1060 by @xmath1061 .    in general , the distributive law means that whenever we add and then multiply , we may instead multiply and then add .",
    "this says , in particular , that elements of a free semiring are sums of products of generators .",
    "it also means that we can factor our operation as follows : @xmath1062 here the first map is a diagonal map , making copies of the variables ; the second map multiplies the variables together to form monomials ; the third map adds the monomials together to form our chosen semiring elements .",
    "we can generalise this , producing natural operations on semirings systematically :    * for any map of sets @xmath1063 we have a pullback map , `` making copies '' , @xmath1064 , defined by @xmath1065 . * for any map of sets @xmath1066 we have a multiplication map @xmath1067 , defined by @xmath1068 . * for any map of sets @xmath1069 we have an addition map @xmath1070 , defined by @xmath1071 .",
    "naturally , these can be composed . given a diagram of maps @xmath1072",
    "we can produce a composite @xmath1073 .",
    "moreover , from our understanding of the distributive law as saying that all elements of free semirings are sums of monomials , this should constitute all natural operations in the theory of semirings .",
    "since they are putatively the morphisms of the theory of semirings , we should be able to compose them .",
    "the composition is itself an instance of the distributive law : we are taking a sum of products of sums of products , and need to rewrite it as a sum of products .",
    "to do this we must interchange the `` products of sums '' in our formula , to get a sum of sums of products of products , which is naturally a sum of products .",
    "this is not difficult , but there is no very pleasant expression for it .",
    "( we do give a precise account , using category theory , valid in greater generality later ) .",
    "regarding the morphisms as being composites of their three constituent parts , we wonder what we can interchange .",
    "moving a pullback to the left of everything else is easy : rather than doing algebra and then making copies of the results , we can make copies of the starting ingredients and then do the same algebraic routine on each copy .",
    "the issue is with sums and products .",
    "in fact , they do nt interchange quite perfectly . as can be seen from the distributive law @xmath1074 , in order to do products then sums , we may need to make some extra copies first : even though the left - hand - side involves no copying , the right - hand - side requires us to make a copy of the variable @xmath120 so we can multiply it into both @xmath121 and @xmath707 .",
    "the upshot is that we can consider two subcategories of the theory of semirings : the subcategory @xmath1075 whose morphisms copy and multiply , corresponding to diagrams @xmath1076 and the subcategory @xmath390 whose elements consist of additions , corresponding to diagrams @xmath1077 the former category is a copy of the theory of commutative monoids , the homotopy category of @xmath663 , and the latter category is just a copy of the category of finite sets .",
    "moreover , they form a unique factorisation system , insofar as any morphism in the theory of semirings can be written uniquely as a morphism from @xmath1075 followed by a morphism from @xmath390 .    for semirings ,",
    "the comments above can be fleshed out to provide a complete and functioning approach @xcite .",
    "but for @xmath0-semirings , where we demand all the axioms only up to coherent homotopies , there is much more to say .",
    "we still expect subcategories @xmath390 and @xmath1075 , and for @xmath1078 and @xmath1079 still expect a composite @xmath1080 ( where we add then multiply ) to be homotopic to a composite @xmath1081 ( where we multiply then add ) . by replacing the centre @xmath1082 in this way ,",
    "this means we have composites up to homotopy for chains of two composable morphisms @xmath1083 .",
    "but we have coherence issues when trying to compose three composable morphisms .",
    "suppose , indeed , we have @xmath1084",
    ". we could replace either @xmath1085 or @xmath1082 , and then simplify , and then do the other .",
    "this gives us potentially two different composites , and naturally we want to ensure that there is no difference up to homotopy . then problems with composing longer chains give coherence requirements on the homotopies .",
    "as in the case of @xmath1086 structures , one natural approach is to find a family of geometric shapes that contains all possible ways of performing these replacements : something akin to the _ associahedra _ or _ stasheff polytopes _ ( @xcite ) .    whereas the associahedra are all just polytopes , we can not just use polytopes in this theory : we have two different subcategories , @xmath1075 and @xmath390 , and must record which part of our shape represents which .",
    "the theory of _ double categories _",
    "@xcite is a primordial example of a type of category theory which distinguishes two sorts of morphisms .",

    "also , we set @xmath1510 these compose according to @xmath1511    so the part @xmath72 records how to use the diagonals and unit maps ( just as in the theory @xmath444 ) , and @xmath186 records the number of times that each element has had the endomorphism applied to it .    similarly , we define @xmath1512 , the theory of objects with automorphisms , in exactly the same way , only we allow maps into @xmath1513 rather than @xmath1514 ( hence an object can have the automorphism applied a negative number of times ) .    the categories @xmath1509 and @xmath1512 are both theories , with the inclusion functor from @xmath444 the one sending @xmath72 to @xmath1515 .",
    "it is easy to check that disjoint unions are products ( with projection maps the projections of @xmath444 together with the zero map ) ; so the inclusion functor is evidently product - preserving and is also surjective on objects .",
    "this coincides with any other reasonable way of defining objects with endomorphisms or automorphisms .",
    "for example , it can be shown that ( for @xmath452 a category with finite products ) : @xmath1516 and @xmath1517 where @xmath1518 denotes the largest sub - kan complex of @xmath452 ( the @xmath9-groupoid of objects and invertible maps between them ) ; this will be studied briefly in section [ components - and - units ] .",
    "now , we actually are concerned with objects @xmath12 such that @xmath1519 is equipped with an endomorphism or automorphism .",
    "we thus define @xmath1520 and @xmath1521 as pushouts in the quasicategory of quasicategories with products and product - preserving functors : @xmath1522^{\\times 2}\\ar[d]&{{{{\\mathrm{finset}}}^{\\mathrm{op}}}}\\ar[d]\\\\            t_1\\ar[r]&\\pb{135}t_2 } }    \\qquad\\qquad   \\vcenter{\\xymatrix{{{{{\\mathrm{finset}}}^{\\mathrm{op}}}}\\ar[r]^{\\times 2}\\ar[d]&{{{{\\mathrm{finset}}}^{\\mathrm{op}}}}\\ar[d]\\\\            t^\\sim_1\\ar[r]&\\pb{135}t^\\sim_2.}}\\ ] ] proposition [ cinftypp - cocomplete ] argues that these pushouts both exist .",
    "the categories @xmath1520 and @xmath1521 are both theories , when equipped with the vertical structure maps @xmath1523 and @xmath1524 .    by construction",
    "the structure maps are product - preserving . being pushouts of essentially surjective maps , they are also essentially surjective",
    ".    moreover , proposition [ models - colimits - to - limits ] tells us that the functor @xmath518 takes pushouts to pullbacks : pushouts of theories model things with two compatible structures .",
    "thus a model of @xmath1520 is indeed a model @xmath12 of @xmath759 equipped with an endomorphism of @xmath1519 , and a model of @xmath1521 is a model @xmath12 of @xmath759 equipped with an automorphism of @xmath1519 .",
    "it is possible to give generators and relations for @xmath1520 and @xmath1521 as a category .",
    "@xmath1525 , and the morphisms have the following generators :    * @xmath1526 for @xmath1223 a map of sets , and * @xmath1527 for @xmath1528 ( together with inverses @xmath1529 in the case of @xmath1521 ) .",
    "these are subject to the following relations :    * @xmath1530 , * @xmath1531 for any distinct @xmath1532 .",
    "* if there is an isomorphism @xmath1533 , we have @xmath1534 .",
    "however , in practice this is rather unpleasant , so we use the indirect approach .",
    "there is an evident inclusion @xmath1535 , arising as the pullback of the evident inclusion @xmath1536 . to complete the structure ,",
    "we need the following :    there is also a natural map @xmath1537 , modelling @xmath1508    it occurs as the universal map associated to the following diagram ( in the quasicategory of quasicategories with products and product - preserving maps ) : @xmath1538^{\\times 2}\\ar[d]&{{{{\\mathrm{finset}}}^{\\mathrm{op}}}}\\ar[d]\\ar[ddr]&\\\\            t_1\\ar[r]\\ar[drr]&\\pb{135}t_2{\\ar@{-->}}[dr]&\\\\            & & { \\mathrm{span}}.}\\ ] ] here the map @xmath1539 is the structure map of @xmath663 . the map @xmath1540 is defined as follows .    to each morphism",
    "@xmath1541 we associate a diagram @xmath1542 where @xmath1543 and the map @xmath1544 is the evident one .",
    "now we define the functor . to an object",
    "@xmath1545 we associate @xmath1546 . to a morphism @xmath1541",
    "we associate the span diagram @xmath1547_{f_1\\sqcup f_2\\sqcup e_1}\\ar[dr]^{\\operatorname{id}_1\\sqcup\\operatorname{id}_2\\sqcup e_2}&\\\\             x\\sqcup x&&y\\sqcup y}\\ ] ] ( where , for example , @xmath1548 is supposed to denote taking the map @xmath72 into the @xmath38th summand ) .",
    "this extends to a functor in a unique fashion .",
    "indeed , given two morphisms @xmath1549 , and @xmath1550 the span diagram @xmath1551\\ar[dr]&&\\\\ & y\\sqcup y\\sqcup e_\\alpha\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&&z\\sqcup z\\sqcup e_\\beta\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&\\\\ x\\sqcup x&&y\\sqcup y&&z\\sqcup z}\\ ] ] realises the compatibility of composition",
    ".    now we can define @xmath1500 to be the pushout @xmath1552\\ar[d]&t^\\sim_2\\ar[d]\\\\             { \\mathrm{span}}\\ar[r]&\\pb{135}{{\\operatorname{gr}}{\\mathrm{span}}}.}\\ ] ]    it has the basic properties we expect :    @xmath1500 is a theory .",
    "the argument is the same as that for @xmath1520 , above .",
    "now , the following proposition justifies our work introducing @xmath1500 :    [ grspan - really - is - grouplike ] the quasicategory of models of @xmath1500 is the quasicategory of grouplike models of @xmath663 .    by proposition [ models - colimits - to - limits ] ,",
    "the models of @xmath1500 are those models of @xmath663 where the natural map @xmath1553 is weakly invertible .",
    "this is a statement of grouplikeness .",
    "this means in particular that discrete models of @xmath1500 are just abelian groups .",
    "further , since models of @xmath1500 in @xmath49 are grouplike @xmath0-monoids , we can think of them as infinite loop spaces , or as connective spectra .",
    "now , given a theory @xmath402 and a morphism of theories @xmath1503 , we define the group - completion @xmath1502 of @xmath402 to be the pushout in @xmath447 of @xmath1504\\ar[d]&{{\\operatorname{gr}}{\\mathrm{span}}}\\ar[d]\\\\             t\\ar[r]_{i_{{\\operatorname{gr}}}}&\\pb{135}{\\operatorname{gr}}t.}\\ ] ]    proposition [ models - colimits - to - limits ] ensures that this is indeed the quasicategory of models of @xmath402 whose underlying monoid is grouplike .",
    "in particular , models of @xmath1554 are grouplike @xmath0-semiring spaces , and can thus should thought of as _ connective ring spectra_.",
    "the morphism @xmath1555 of theories gives a `` forgetful '' pullback functor @xmath1556 .",
    "proposition [ models - pushforward ] equips this with a left adjoint we call @xmath1557 , such that as mapping spaces @xmath1558 from this description we see are entitled to regard @xmath1559 as the group completion of @xmath136 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1560 , the functor @xmath1557 is a quasicategorical left adjoint to the inclusion functor of quasicategories from grouplike @xmath0-spaces to all @xmath0-spaces .",
    "thus , in particular , for @xmath1560 , our construction @xmath1559 is isomorphic to the traditional constructions of group completion , such as @xmath1561 .",
    "the functor @xmath1562 is a product - preserving functor from the quasicategory @xmath49 to the ordinary category @xmath150 , which we call the _",
    "components functor_. as a result , any model of @xmath663 in @xmath49 has an underlying monoid of components , any model of @xmath1500 in @xmath49 has an underlying group of components , and so on .",
    "also , regarding @xmath1562 as valued instead in discrete spaces , there is a natural map @xmath1563 .",
    "it is quick to check that if @xmath1564 , then the homotopy pullback @xmath1565 is given by those components of @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath1135 .",
    "this is clear from the standard model for a homotopy pullback of spaces ( or alternatively , by oldfashioned means : the map @xmath1566 is a fibration for all fibrant @xmath12 ) .    given a model @xmath1567 , we define the _ monoid of units _ @xmath1568 via the pullback ( in models of @xmath663 ) @xmath1569\\ar[d]&m\\ar[d]\\\\ ( \\pi_0m)^\\times\\ar[r]&\\pi_0m.}\\ ] ] since limits are computed pointwise , we see in particular that the underlying space of @xmath147 is built in the same way : @xmath1570\\ar[d]&|m|\\ar[d]\\\\ ( \\pi_0m)^\\times\\ar[r]&\\pi_0m.}\\ ] ]    the model @xmath1571 is grouplike by construction , and thus admits a homotopy unique lift to a model of @xmath1500 .",
    "evidently , @xmath1562 is an isomorphism on discrete spaces .",
    "so if we had started with a discrete model of @xmath663 : an ordinary monoid , then we would have produced its group of units , in the usual sense .",
    "the basic result showing that this construction has good properties is the following :    there is an adjunction , where the left adjoint is given by @xmath1572 , and with the right adjoint given by restricting to those connected components which are invertible on @xmath1562 .",
    "we define a simplicial set @xmath1573 together with a natural map @xmath1574 by @xmath1575    this is readily shown to be an inner kan fibration using that @xmath1576 is a quasicategory and @xmath1577 is equivalent to an a subquasicategory ( the subquasicategory of grouplike objects ) .",
    "it is also not difficult to show that , for @xmath1578 , the morphism @xmath1579 is cocartesian .",
    "given @xmath1580 given by a product - preserving functor @xmath1581 , we postcompose with the product - preserving functor @xmath1582 to get a model @xmath1583 of @xmath663 on @xmath150 : a commutative monoid",
    ".    we can then define @xmath1584 ( which we also write @xmath1585 to be obtained by restricting to the subspaces of @xmath147 whose image in @xmath1583 lies in @xmath1586 ; this forms the pullback ( in models of @xmath663 ) as follows : @xmath1569\\ar[d]&m\\ar[d]\\\\ ( \\pi_0m)^\\times\\ar[r]&\\pi_0m.}\\ ] ]    it is also quick to show that for any grouplike commutative monoid @xmath136 , the morphism @xmath1587 is a cartesian morphism in @xmath1573 , so that the projection to @xmath114 is bicartesian and so classifies an adjunction .",
    "one particularly interesting application of this is to the units of ring spectra .",
    "we recall from section [ spam - e - infty ] that there is a natural map @xmath1588 , the _ inclusion of the multiplicative monoid structure _ given by    @xmath1300 where @xmath1301 is the discrete simplicial set on objects @xmath1301 , and @xmath1302 is the restriction of @xmath1238 to @xmath1301 .",
    "accordingly , we define the _ units _ of a model of @xmath1222 to be the units of the underlying multiplicative monoid .    using proposition [ models - pushforward ] , this fits into a chain of adjunctions @xmath1589^{i^*_{{\\operatorname{gr}}}}&&\\operatorname{mod}({\\mathrm{span}})\\ar@<2pt>[ll]^{\\mathrm{units}}\\ar@<2pt>[rr]^{i_*}&&\\operatorname{mod}({\\operatorname{gr}}{\\mathrm{rspan}})\\ar@<2pt>[ll]^{i^*}}\\ ] ]    here @xmath28 is the diagonal of the following commutative square of theories : @xmath1504\\ar[d]\\ar[dr]^i&{\\operatorname{gr}}{\\mathrm{span}}\\ar[d]\\\\            { \\mathrm{rspan}}\\ar[r]&{\\operatorname{gr}}{\\mathrm{rspan}}.}\\ ] ]    the right adjoint , associating to a connective ring spectrum the units of its underlying multiplicative monoid , is the correct notion of the units of a connective ring spectrum .",
    "the left adjoint takes a connective spectrum and performs a kind of topological groupring construction , which models @xmath1590 .",
    "this adjunction has been achieved already in @xcite , by very different means .",
    "recall that the inclusion @xmath1591 admits a left adjoint , the _ grothendieck construction_. this gives the universal functorial group - valued invariant of a monoid .",
    "thus , for example , when we try to define @xmath1592 of a ring @xmath764 to be the universal group - valued invariant of @xmath764-modules which is additive on direct sums , we are led to define it to be the grothendieck construction of the monoid of isomorphism classes of @xmath764-modules ( with the monoid operation given by direct sum ) .",
    "first of all , there is an adjunction between the ordinary categories @xmath1595 and @xmath1596 of kan complexes and of inner kan complexes respectively .",
    "the left adjoint @xmath1597 is the evident inclusion ; the right adjoint @xmath1598 associates to a space its unique maximal kan subsimplicial set : @xmath1599 is the union of the images of all maps from kan complexes into @xmath12 .",
    "now , we seek to boost the adjunction between @xmath1597 and @xmath1598 to an adjunction between @xmath49 and @xmath55 . we shall exhibit a quasicategory @xmath390 and bicartesian functor @xmath1602 to classify this adjunction .",
    "as in previous arguments of this sort , a lifting problem of shape @xmath634 can be decoded to give an extension problem @xmath1610\\ar[dr]&\\delta^{n+2}{\\ar@{-->}}[d]\\\\ & { \\mathcal{a}}.}\\ ] ] here the final two vertices are sent to @xmath1611 and @xmath10 respectively . since @xmath1611 is adjoint in the category of ordinary categories , all the maps to @xmath10 actually factor through @xmath1611 .",
    "thus we can recover a map @xmath1612 , sending the final two vertices to @xmath1611 .              in order to apply the adjoint functor theorem , it remains to show that @xmath38 preserves small limits ; as usual it suffices to consider products and pullbacks .",
    "quasicategorical products are modelled by products of simplicial sets in both @xmath49 and @xmath55 . and",
    "homotopy pullbacks ( of diagrams @xmath1615 ) are modelled in both categories by the simplicial set @xmath1616 where @xmath1617 is the standard contractible simplicial set on two vertices ( with one @xmath4-cell for each @xmath366-tuple of vertices ) .    by definition , for any quasicategory @xmath10 and kan complex @xmath12",
    "this functor @xmath138 satisfies @xmath1618 since the homspaces are computed the same way , this means @xmath1619 is a space weakly equivalent to @xmath10 ; thus if a model for @xmath138 is needed , any fibrant replacement functor will do ( such as kan s @xmath1620 @xcite , or the singular complex of the geometric realisation ) .",
    "the subsection above gives us a product - preserving `` @xmath9-groupoid completion '' functor .",
    "we have provocatively named it @xmath138 ; we combine it with the group - completion functor of theories to give a model of @xmath1-theory .    given a monoidal theory @xmath402 and a model @xmath1626",
