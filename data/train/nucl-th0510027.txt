    "one of the unexpected results from experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the relatively strong second harmonic moment of the transverse momentum distribution , referred to as the elliptic flow .",
    "measurements of the elliptic flow by the phenix , phobos and star collaborations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) reveal rich details in terms of its dependence on particle type , transverse and longitudinal momentum variables , on the centrality and the bombarding energy of the collision . in the soft transverse momentum region , these measurements at mid - rapidity are reasonably well described by hydrodynamical models  @xcite . however , the dependence of the elliptic flow on the longitudinal momentum variable pseudo - rapidity and its excitation function has resisted descriptions in terms of hydrodynamical models ( but see their new description by the spherio model  @xcite ) .    here",
    "we show that these data are consistent with the theoretical and analytic predictions that are based on eqs .",
    "( 1 - 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , on perfect fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "we furthermore calculate rapidity dependent hbt ( bose - einstein ) radii in the framework of the model and make prediction on the universal scaling of these observables .",
    "our tool in describing the pseudorapidity - dependent elliptic flow and hbt radii is the buda - lund hydrodynamical model .",
    "the buda - lund hydro model  @xcite is successful in describing the brahms , phenix , phobos and star data on identified single particle spectra and the transverse mass dependent bose - einstein or hbt radii as well as the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles in au + au collisions both at @xmath0 gev  @xcite and at @xmath1 gev  @xcite .",
    "however the elliptic flow would be zero in an axially symmetric case , so we developed the ellipsoidal generalization of the model that describes an expanding ellipsoid with principal axes @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . their derivatives with respect to proper - time ( expansion rates ) are denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization goes back to the original one , if the transverse directed principal axes of the ellipsoid are equal , ie @xmath8 ( and also @xmath9 ) .",
    "the deviation from axial symmetry can be measured by the momentum - space eccentricity , @xmath10    the exact analytic solutions of hydrodynamics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which form the basis of the buda - lund hydro model , develop hubble - flow for late times , ie @xmath11 , so the momentum - space eccentricity @xmath12 nearly equals space - time eccentricity @xmath13 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath14 additionally .",
    "it represents the elongation of the source expressed in units of space - time rapidity .",
    "let us consider furthermore that at the freeze - out @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and so @xmath17    hence , in this paper we extract space - time eccentricity ( @xmath13 ) , average transverse flow ( @xmath18 ) and longitudinal elongation ( @xmath19 ) from the data , instead of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in the time dependent hydrodynamical solutions ,",
    "these values evolve in time , however , it was show in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and so @xmath13 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 become constants of the motion in the late stages of the expansion .",
    "the result for the elliptic flow ( under certain conditions detailed in ref  @xcite ) is the following simple universal scaling law : @xmath20    the model predicts an _",
    "universal scaling : _ every @xmath21 measurement is predicted to fall on the same _ universal _ scaling curve @xmath22 when plotted against @xmath23 .",
    "this means , that @xmath21 depends on any physical parameter ( transverse or longitudinal momentum , center of mass energy , centrality , type of the colliding nucleus etc . ) only through the ( universal ) scaling paremeter @xmath23 .",
    "here @xmath23 is the scaling variable , defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 here @xmath27 measures the temperature gradient in the transverse direction , at the freeze - out , @xmath28 is the transverse mass , @xmath29 the central temperature at the freeze - out , while @xmath30 is the space - time rapidity of the saddle - point ( point of maximal emittivity ) .",
    "this saddlepoint depends on the rapidity , the longitudinal expansion , the transverse mass and on the central freeze - out temperature : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rapidity .",

    ", we thus performed a saddle point integration in the transverse momentum variable and performed a change of variables to the pseudo - rapidity @xmath35 , similarly to ref .",
    "this way , we have evaluated the single - particle invariant spectra in terms of the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and calculated @xmath33 from this distribution , a procedure corresponding to the phobos measurement decribed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have found that the essential fit parameters are @xmath13 and @xmath19 , and the quality of the fit is insensitive to the precise value of @xmath29 , @xmath38 and @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters dominate the azimuthal - averaged single particle spectra as well as the hbt ( bose - einstein ) radii , however they only marginally influence @xmath21 .",
    "their precise value is irrelevant in a broad region of values and does not influence the confidence level of the @xmath33 fits .",
    "hence we have fixed their values as given in the caption of table  [ t : fit ] .",
