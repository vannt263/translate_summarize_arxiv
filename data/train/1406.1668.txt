    "for the last years a considerable effort has been invested to understand the entanglement of quantum systems .",
    "this is , in schr \" odinger words , _ the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics _",
    "@xcite and , as we now understand , the property that makes the quantum computation to overtake the classical one .",
    "moreover , the study of the entanglement has a considerable interest from many other perspectives , ranging from condensed matter physics @xcite or quantum field theory @xcite to black hole physics @xcite and the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "one of the preferred magnitudes to characterise entanglement is the rnyi entropy of the reduced state , that provides information on the full entanglement spectrum .",
    "let us consider a bipartite system such that its hilbert space can be written as the tensor product @xmath0 , of the hilbert space of subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 in which we have divided it .",
    "if @xmath3 is the density matrix that describes the state of the whole system , the rnyi entropy of @xmath1 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath1 with @xmath6 denoting the partial trace to the complementary subsystem @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath7 , we obtain von neumann entropy , @xmath8 if the system is in a pure state @xmath9 , then @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in that case",
    ", this quantity provides a very appropriate measure of the degree of entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the state @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it encodes universal properties of extended systems in the neighbourhood of quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath12 for fermionic chains is specially interesting and simple because on one hand side , they can be mapped to spin chains by means of a non local jordan - wigner transform and , on the other side , we can apply both analytical techniques and efficient numerical algorithms . in this respect ,",
    "much work has been done when @xmath1 is a single interval . in this case , a general result @xcite for the eigenstates of a free , translational invariant hamiltonian can be obtained using the fact that the correlation matrix of an interval is of the toeplitz type ( this property was first noticed by jin and korepin @xcite for the ground state , and it is also applied in e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are other different approaches .",
    "in particular , conformal field theory ( cft ) is a powerful tool for the ground state entanglement entropy when the chain is described by a local and critical hamiltonian @xcite and it can be extended to excited states too @xcite . on the numerical side , we can reduce the complexity of computing the rnyi entropy which , in principle , grows exponentially with the size of the subsystem to a polynomial dependence .",
    "this is possible thanks to the relationship obtained in @xcite between the density matrix and the two - point correlation functions for situations , like ours , in which wick factorisation holds .",
    "a natural extension of the previous works is to consider a subsystem @xmath1 composed of disjoint intervals .",
    "there are some recent papers where this problem is addressed for the ground state of a local hamiltonian , which can be analysed using cft @xcite .",
    "if we try to apply the previous technique to this case we find that , although wick factorisation still holds and therefore the complexity of the computation grows polynomially , the corresponding matrix for several blocks is no longer of the toeplitz type and the asymptotic expansion for its determinant is not known in the literature , so far .    in this work , inspired by the previous analytical results and some particular examples , we conjecture a general asymptotic expression of @xmath12 for the eigenstates of a free , translational invariant fermionic hamiltonian when @xmath1 is composed by several disjoint blocks .",
    "we check our hypothesis numerically and trace back its origin to a conjecture on the determinant of a principal sub - matrix of a toeplitz matrix .",
    "the paper is organised in the following fashion . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the notation and review the results for the entropy of a single interval . in section iii , we recall the results predicted by cft for two disjoint intervals in the ground state of local theories and we propose a new conjecture for a general eigenstate .",
    "we check it numerically in section iv , while in section v we generalise our formula for an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals and conjecture an asymptotic expression for the determinant of a sub - matrix of a toeplitz matrix . finally in section vi we collect our conclusions and possible continuations of our work .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath13 identical spin - less fermions with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , representing respectively the annihilation and creation operator for the site @xmath17 .",
    "the only non vanishing anticommutation relations are @xmath18 furthermore , we shall assume periodic boundary conditions : @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the eigenstates of a free , translational invariant hamiltonian , @xmath20 where b - operators are the discrete fourier transform of @xmath21-operators , @xmath22 which also satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations .",
    "the ket @xmath23 represents the vacuum state in the fock space , @xmath24 is a particular set of occupied modes and @xmath25 is the adjoint of @xmath26 .",
    "we divide the chain into two subsets @xmath1 and @xmath27 .",
    "adapted to this decomposition we can factor out the hilbert space @xmath28 .",
    "the goal is to study the entanglement between these subsystems .    in order to do that we must construct the reduced density matrix of each subsystem , that in general does not correspond to a pure state , and compute its rnyi entropy . as it was discussed before , for pure states , the entropy of a subsystem coincides with that of the complementary one and provides a measurement for the entanglement between them .",
    "once we have obtained the reduced density matrix , we can compute its rnyi entropy .",
    "however , considering that the dimension of @xmath29 is @xmath30 , the computational time grows exponentially with the size @xmath31 of the subsystem .",
    "fortunately , there exists an algorithm @xcite , that can be applied in some cases and allows to reduce the exponential growth to a potential one . according to it ,",
    "if the reduced density matrix satisfies the wick decomposition property , i.e. the @xmath17-point functions factor out into two - point functions ( see @xcite ) , the full reduced density matrix @xmath32 , of dimension @xmath30 , can be obtained from the two - point correlation matrix , whose dimension is @xmath31 .",
    "this dramatic gain of computational power allows us to deal with larger subsystems @xmath1 without exhausting the computational capabilities .",
    "this is essential for us , as we will be interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy for large values of the size of the subsystem .",
    "it is immediate to show that the wick decomposition property , for the reduced density matrix , follows from the same one for the full density matrix . and",
    "the later enjoys this property for any pure state corresponding to a slater determinant , like the one in ( [ state ] ) .    for these states",
    "the full density matrix , @xmath33 , preserves the total fermionic number and therefore @xmath34 .",
    "evidently , this property is also fulfilled by the reduced density matrices .    in that case",

    "we are interested in the large @xmath13 ( thermodynamic ) limit , in which case the role played by @xmath44 is taken by a density @xmath45 , such that @xmath46    a few examples , that will be useful in the following , may help to understand the correspondence :    state 0 : : :    the vacuum @xmath47 , that    corresponds to @xmath48 and has    associated a constant density @xmath49 .",

    "in fact , in this case the matrix @xmath40 has all the entries of every sub - diagonal parallel to the main one equal , as it is represented in fig [ toeplitz ] a. in other words , it is a diagonal - constant or toeplitz matrix .",
    "note that this property does not hold , in general , if there is some gap between two sites in @xmath1 ; fig .",
    "[ toeplitz ] b provides an example of this .",
    "it turns out that there exist asymptotic formulae for computing the determinant of toeplitz matrices and using them in ( [ renyi1 ] ) we can derive an expression for the entanglement entropy @xcite . applying the general results to our case of interest and taking a piecewise constant @xmath45 with discontinuities at @xmath58 , @xmath59 the entanglement entropy , when @xmath1 is an interval , reads @xmath60 where the dots represent terms that vanish in the large @xmath31 limit .",
    "the coefficients depend only on @xmath45 , not on @xmath1 , and their computation is described below .    in first place ,",
    "the linear term is given by @xmath61    in order to compute @xmath62 we introduce @xmath63 where the @xmath64 s are taken from ( [ density ] ) , and we define @xmath65 now @xmath66 where the upper limit in the sum is the number of discontinuity points in @xmath45 .",

    "we also perform the numeric computation of the entropy and compare it with the asymptotic results to show the perfect agreement between both calculations .",
    "the results for the states defined before are the following :    state 0 : : :    in this case @xmath49 and as we have    @xmath70 the linear coefficient vanishes . on the    other hand",
    ", @xmath71 has no discontinuities and therefore    @xmath72 and @xmath73 vanish    and the entanglement entropy @xmath74 , which can    be obtained directly by noticing that @xmath75    is separable .",
    "state 1 : : :    as it is well known @xcite this state can be interpreted as the    ground state of a one dimensional , local , critical theory .",
    "therefore ,    the results from conformal field theory apply and we should have    @xcite @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the central charge of the underlying    conformal field theory and @xmath78 a constant that    depends on the details of the theory ( non universal).on the other    hand , if we apply our general result and due to the fact that    @xmath79 we have    @xmath80 . also the logarithmic coefficient can    be computed analytically to give    @xmath81 , while the constant    term does not have a simple expression for general    @xmath82 . putting all together we have    @xmath83    that agrees with ( [ unoconformal ] ) for a central charge    @xmath84 .",
    "state 2 : : :    if we write @xmath85 in the basis of    _ positions _ we have    @xmath86    therefore it is easy to compute , exactly , the entanglement entropy for    any subsystem . in particular",
    "if @xmath1 is an interval of size    smaller than @xmath87 the reduced density matrix is    proportional to the identity @xmath88 and    therefore @xmath89 which is independent of    @xmath82 and is the largest possible entropy for a mixed    state in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath30 . if we    derive the coefficients of the expansion according to    ( [ a_alpha],[b_alpha],[c_alpha ] ) we get    @xmath90 and , as we do not    have any discontinuity , @xmath91",
    "finally , the expansion leads to ( [ entropy2 ] ) that is exact in this    case .",
    "state 3 : : :    the entanglement entropy for this state combines the features of the    two previous ones : it has a non zero linear coefficient as    @xmath45 is different from @xmath92 in some    interval and it has discontinuities which give rise to the logarithmic    and constant coefficients . the linear term is easily computed to give    @xmath93 and for integer    @xmath94 we have @xcite ,    @xmath95    while for @xmath96    @xmath97    in this paper we want to go one step further and discuss the case when @xmath1 is made out of several intervals . our goal is to derive asymptotic formulae for the entanglement entropy similar to ( [ asymptotic ] ) . in this case , however , we can not use the fisher - hartwig formula and we will approach the problem by using the results from conformal field theory and performing numeric computations . later on",
    "we will be able to derive a generalisation of fisher - hartwig conjecture that covers the case of several intervals .",
    "as it was mentioned before , if the set @xmath1 is composed of non contiguous sites , for instance the union of two separate intervals @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 made out of contiguous sites , the matrix @xmath40 is not of the toeplitz type any more .",
    "this is shown pictorially in fig .",
    "[ toeplitz ] b , where we represent the fact that while all four sub - matrices are toeplitz , the full matrix is not : except for the main diagonal all the others have two kinds of entries .    in this situation",
    "we can not apply the fisher - hartwig conjecture and we should try to get insights on the behaviour of the entanglement entropy from a different source .",
    "if the state we consider corresponds to the ground state of a critical , local , one dimensional system ( like it happens for the state 1 ) we can use the conformal invariance of the theory , that follows from the absence of a fundamental length ( zero mass gap ) .",
    "this powerful symmetry determine to some extent the behaviour of the entanglement entropy .",
    "in this case @xcite if we take @xmath101\\cup[u_2,v_2]$ ] with @xmath102 , global conformal invariance leads to @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the cross ratio @xmath105 which is invariant under the linear fractional transformations @xmath106 , @xmath107 is a non universal function that depends on the details of the theory ( see @xcite ) , @xmath108 is the conformal dimension of the insertions and , finally , @xmath109 is a constant that will be fixed below .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for the ground state of critical free fermions ( as it is our case ) @xmath110 .",
    "then if we compute the rnyi entropy we obtain @xmath111 in order to determine the constant on the right we can take the limit of large separation between @xmath99 and @xmath100 in which case the entropy should go to the sum of the entropy of every interval .",
    "therefore the constant on the right of ( [ entrconforme ] ) should be twice the constant for a single interval @xmath78 that we determined in the previous section .    in summary , for a critical , local theory",
    "for which @xmath112 , like the state 1 , we should have @xmath113 where the constants are those determined in the previous section for a single interval .",
    "we have checked the expression against numerical results and it completely agrees .",
    "another insight on the problem can be gained by considering the state 2 . in this case",
    ", we can compute the entropy exactly and , provided @xmath114 we have that the reduced density matrix is again proportional to the identity and @xmath115 where , in this case , @xmath116 .",
    "it should be noticed that the coefficient that multiplies the size of the subsystem coincides with that for a single interval .    if we put together the two previous results we conjecture the following expression for the rnyi entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals for a general state : @xmath117 where the coefficients @xmath118 are those determined in ( [ a_alpha],[b_alpha],[c_alpha ] ) for a single interval . the expression ( [ entrdos ] )",
    "should be valid in the thermodynamic limit , while the dots stand for contributions that vanish when @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "in the next section we will investigate numerically the validity of our conjecture .",
    "in order to check the accuracy of the previous expression it will be useful to introduce the so called mutual information @xmath121 defined by @xmath122 from ( [ entrdos ] ) we obtain the simple expression @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the cross ratio in eq . ( [ invariant ] ) . the logarithmic coefficient @xmath62 is obtained from the fisher - hartwig conjecture for the expansion of the entropy for a single interval , as it is discussed in section ii .",
    "we perform numerical calculations for the state 3 choosing an infinite chain , @xmath125 when @xmath96 ( von neumann entropy ) and @xmath126 .",
    "since the wick decomposition is satisfied , they can be carried out diagonalising the correlation matrix @xmath40 ( [ vmatrix ] ) for this configuration and then applying the first equality of ( [ renyi1 ] ) . as we have discussed before",
    ", this implies an impressive simplification ( @xmath40 has dimension @xmath31 while @xmath32 , @xmath30 ) which we need to explore the asymptotic behaviour of the mutual information . in fact , in the following numerical computation we have covered values of @xmath31 from @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "notice that these values would be absolutely out of reach in a direct computation using @xmath32 , with dimension @xmath129 .    for the diagonalisation ,",
    "we have employed the corresponding routine for real symmetric matrices included in the gnu scientific library @xcite for c , which works in double precision .",
