    "although there are older notions of records in the philosophical literature ( see e.g. reichenbach @xcite or denbigh @xcite ) , this paper mostly concerns records in the modern physics literature , where they are linked to specific and partly technical quantum cosmology and quantum gravity issues ( sec [ pot ] , [ rad ] , [ qcos ] ) .",

    "hartle @xcite and halliwell @xcite have considered a ` records theory within histories theory ' . @xcite",
    "( sec 2.1 ) is not primarily timeless [ though the emphasis is on ( sub)histories rather than ( sub)configurations and times ] , but a records theory sits within it .",
    "records theory in this approach benefits by inheriting part of the structural framework that has been developed for histories theory .",
    "records are  _ somewhere in the universe that information is stored when _    \" ( p 3353 of @xcite )",
    ".    this paper s records theory does not follow one of these strands but is rather a synthesis of elements drawn from each of them , to be subjected to testing using toy models , and refined if required . in outline ,",
    "i consider _ records _ to be information - containing subconfigurations of a single instant .",
    "_ records theory _ is then the study of these and how dynamics ( or history or science ) is to be abstracted from correlations between same - instant records .",
    "it is to make this abstraction meaningful that i insist on records being subconfigurations rather than whole instants . in this way",
    ", one can get round some of barbour s obstacles as regards why we appear to experience dynamics within a timeless universe ",
    "it is an overall - timeless universe , but subsystems can provide approximate relative time standards for each other , and what is habitually observed is the dynamics of subsystems rather than of the whole universe @xcite .    for adopting a records theory approach to profitable",
    ", i argue that records should have the following properties .",
    "records should be _ useable _ , in that 1 ) their whereabouts [ c.f .",
    "( 0 ) ] should be spatially - localized subconfigurations of the universe , for whatever notion of space that one s theory has and restricted to the observationally accessible part thereof .",
    "2 ) they should also belong to a part of the subconfiguration space for which our imprecision of identification of the subconfiguration by how we observe it does not too greatly distort the extraction of information .",
    "records should also be _ useful _ : their information content [ c.f .",
    "( 0 ) ] should be high enough and of the right sort of quality to enable reliable measures of correlation to be computed .",
    "as not all systems that one could be dealing with have instants solely of this nature , one would expect that a records theory approach would not always be profitable .",
    "barbour s conceptualization in particular ( and also page s ) additionally require semblance of dynamics to emerge from the records .",
    "barbour furthermore asks @xcite whether there are any _ selection principles _ for such records ( which he calls ` time capsules ' ; the bubble chamber with the @xmath1-particle track within is a such ) .",
    "if these features are to be incorporated , one would additionally need a ( relative ) measure of semblance of dynamics .",
    "this would likely have some links with the notions of information content and quality , but would appear to require further input as a world could be detailed and nevertheless have no global arrow of time .",
    "barbour furthermore conjectures @xcite that the selection priciple is through the shape of the configuration space being such that the wavefunction is concentrated in regions containing ` time capsules ' .",
    "however , he does not supply any evidence for this based on mathematical models .",
    "semiclassical approach _ to quantum gravity ( see sec 2.1 ) might explain  or supplant ",
    "barbour s proposal @xcite , while _ branching processes _ and histories theory @xcite may provide alternative selection principles for records ( see sec 7.3 for more ) .    in sec [ motivation ] and sec 4.4 , i assess how records theory has been motivated in the literature .",
    "records theory has been motivated by 1 ) universality : it is a conceptual scheme for any kind of physical system ( though it is not the only such conceptual scheme ) .",
    "2 ) by there not being limitations to conceptualizing about change , processes , dynamics , history and science in the timeless terms of records theory .",
    "i provide some evidence for this by looking at the question types that these conceptualizations can address and then finding ways of converting becoming questions into being questions .",
    "some of these conversions , however , can be highly cumbersome in practise .",
    "3 ) records theory is furthermore likely to be useful in the study of closed systems , including quantum cosmology s study of the universe as a whole .",
    "4 ) it is also one natural perspective for quantum gravity : canonically quantizing general relativity ( gr ) @xcite encounters serious conceptual and technical difficulties , among which one major conceptual problem is the problem of time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this problem s origin is in time playing incompatible roles in the standard formulations of gr and of qm ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fundamental timelessness is one natural and clear resolution of this incompatibility , and records theory is one approach to timelessness .",
    "5 ) records theory has also been motivated in the literature by canonical quantum gr s wheeler  dewitt equation @xcite giving rise to a frozen formalism .",
    "6 ) by ` now ' being what we experience .",
    "7 ) by consideration of what is operationally meaningful .",
    "i provide arguments _ against _ these last three . in the case of 7",
    ") , i argue that the view that histories theory is primarily reconstruction from records is not a motivation but rather an assertion to be demonstrated , because the records present in nature may not in general be of sufficient quality to be able to reconstruct history .",
    "i then propose in sec 4 a ground - level structure for records theory which parallels some of the ground - level structure in histories theory . as it should not be discounted that it may be possible to set up a distinct and useful records theory without assuming all the levels of structure of histories theory , i do not for the moment demand any of history theory s higher levels of structure .",
    "i then comment on the useability , usefulness and correlation aspects of records in sec 46 ( more technical detail of these will be provided elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "i illustrate records theory with the toy models of sec [ toys ] : ordinary mechanics , relational particle mechanics , detector models and inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous cosmology @xcite ( a setting which is relevant as regards the origen of galaxies and of temperature variations in the cmb ) .",
    "the canonical formulation of gr traditionally uses as its base objects the 3-metric variables @xmath2 on spatial slices @xmath3 of spacetime .",
    "the momenta conjugate to these are denoted by @xmath4 and are closely related to the extrinsic curvature of that space within spacetime .",
    "canonical gr is a constrained theory .",
    "it is governed by 1 ) the linear _ momentum constraint _ ^(x^ ; h _ , ^ ] -2_^ + _ ^= 0 [ grmom ] , which is interpretable as the the physics being encoded within the 3-geometry rather than on the coordinate grid painted upon it .",
    "hence this canonical formulation of gr is a _ geometrodynamics_. 2 ) the quadratic scalar 1-density _ hamiltonian constraint _",
    "( x^ ; h _ , ^ ] n^ _ _ + - + 2 + ( ) = 0 , [ grham ] whose interpretation is more problematic .    at the quantum level ,",
    "one then has the quantum momentum constraint ^- 2 _ + ^ = 0 [ grqmom ] which is likewise interpretable as the wavefunction of the universe @xmath5 depending on the 3-geometry rather than on any coordinate grid painted upon it . however , the quantum hamiltonian constraint that one obtains  the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation ( wde ) @xcite , = \\ { - ^2 \\ {  \\ { n^ } + } - + ( ) } + 2= 0 [ wde ] , appears to be a timeless equation : a _ stationary _ , or _ time - independent schrdinger equation _ ( tise ) ) .",
    "this _ frozen formalism _ that the wde seems to imply can be traced back to the diffeomorphism invariance of gr , with its absense of any appended external parameter such as that which conventionally plays the role of time in newtonian theory .",
    "the frozen formalism is a prominent part of the problem of time ( pot ) for canonical quantum gr ( though this is by no means the only manifestation of the pot nor do all possible approaches to canonical quantum gr , let alone quantum gravity , involve such an equation , see especially @xcite ) .",
    "various interpretational strategies for dealing with the pot are discussed in @xcite , which are references of use throughout this subsection . some of the differences in strategy result from two prevalent and conflicting philosophical positions concerning time @xcite : a ) that time is fundamental , or b ) that time should be eliminated from one s conceptualization of the world .",
    "these two perspectives can be related in various ways to schemes for the world and the scientific enterprise therein which question - types involving ` becoming ' fundamentally make sense , or only those involving ` being ' .",
    "the following strategies have been put forward for addressing the pot .",
    "\\1 ) internal time : there might be a fundamental classical time in all circumstances .",
    "this might not be obvious through its being ` hidden within ' the theory .",
    "it would be found by replacing @xmath6 by its classical solution for a momentum variable that is perhaps new ( obtained by a canonical transformation ) : @xmath7 \\equiv   { \\cal h}^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize true}}(x ; { \\cal t}_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize int } } , q_{\\st } , p^{\\st})$ ] .",
    "then quantization gives a time-_dependent _ schrdinger equation ( tdse )    @xmath8 that supplants ( [ wde ] ) .",
    "an example of hidden internal time candidate is gr s york time @xcite which is proportional to the constant mean curvature slices of spacetime , @xmath9 = const , that generalize the maximal slices , @xmath10 .",
    "\\2 ) emergent time : in certain , possibly predominant , circumstances , an _",
    "emergent notion of time _ may occur .",
    "one possibility for this is that in situations in which the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation @xmath11 for h ` heavy ' and l ` light ' degrees of freedom and the wkb approximation @xmath12 are applicable , an emergent time drops out of the wde @xcite . for",
    ", @xmath13 contains @xmath14 by the hamilton ",
    "jacobi relation for the momentum , and this expression contains @xmath15 by the momentum ",
    "velocity relation , which is @xmath16 by the chain - rule so that one has a tdse for the light degrees of freedom with respect to a time standard that is ( approximately ) provided by the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "an issue here is that ( semi)classical conditions need not always occur  guarantee of a classical ` large ' as in the copenhagen interpretation of qm has been cast aside in quantum cosmology and will then by no means be recovered in all possible situations .",
    "\\3 ) timelessness : at face value , ( [ wde ] ) is suggestive of there fundamentally being no time for the universe as a whole in spatially compact without boundary gr .",
    "these strategies aim to supplant ` becoming ' with ` being ' at the primary level @xcite .",
    "history or dynamics are to be _ apparent notions _ to be constructed from the instant @xcite .",
    "examples of timeless strategies include the nave schrdinger interpretation @xcite ( ` nave ' because it uses @xmath17 as its inner product with no heed for the constraints ) and the wider - ranging conditional probabilities interpretation @xcite which has been suggested to be general enough to cover all types of questions that occur in science @xcite .",
    "( ` interpretation ' here is meant in the sense of ` interpretation of quantum theory ' . )",
    "\\4 ) histories theory : instead , it could be the histories themselves which are primary , and the records that are constructs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ then it is not clear whether records theory within history theory is necessarily the same as records theory from first principles .",
    "]    each of these strategies has problems if examined in detail .",
    "pot resolutions are usually taken to be required to work for a full theory of gravitation , so that establishing that they work for special cases or toy models is not enough .",
    "i in no way claim that the present paper is exhaustive as regards what problems timeless strategies have  see @xcite for plenty more issues .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a records approach is natural if one takes the frozen formalism seriously .",
    "it has also often been argued ( see e.g. @xcite ) that successors to the wde through gr being supplanted would likely also have a frozen formalism , but i note that this is not always the case , e.g. there is a higher derivative theory for which one of the natural variable sets contains an already - explicit internal time @xcite .",
    "one might then also question whether one should go beyond kucha and isham s adherence to gr @xcite in investigating the pot .",
    "barbour @xcite and barbour and smolin @xcite additionally suggested timeless records approaches as radical approachs that are attractive due to other , more conventional strategies failures to resolve the pot .",
    "however , arguing by elimination is dangerous , firstly because we are unlikely to ever know what all the conceptual and technical options are .",
    "secondly , i point out that the claim that the radical records approach has no ( or fewer ) problems is itself dubious , both because knowing few problems may merely reflect that it has been studied less than other approaches and because there _ are _ salient problems as regards the recovery of a semblance of dynamics or history for subsystems : i provide some in sec 7 .",
    "an alternative to thinking in terms of radical solutions is to view the frozen formalism not as a truth to be taken seriously but as a ` dynamics observed within a timeless universe ' ` paradox ' to be resolved .",
    "the semiclassical approach , internal time approach and histories theory do look like having ` paradox ' resolving capacities ( see e.g. sec 2.1 ) . resolving it may well hinge on the difference between physics of a closed universe and physics in a closed universe .",
    "if a small subsystem is studied , there s little trouble with the larger and more influential exterior providing a background time . by this device ,",
    "an essentially standard perspective on ordinary physics ( such as in @xcite ) or smaller scale cosmology ( such as isolated gravitational perturbations ) suffices .",
    "barbour s ` end of time ' idea @xcite that the timelessness mystery pervades ordinary physics can thus be undone .",
    "mysteries that may need radical addressing remain only for more obviously problematic cases that concern genuinely closed systems such as the whole universe .",
    "does the common intuition that ` now is what we experience ' make records theory a natural , reasonable approach to theoretical physics ?",
    "however the perceived now is , from a becoming perspective , actually a ` specious present ' i.e. an integrated experience whose formation requires a timescale that is vastly greater than that of already - known quantum processes .",
    "this may undermine taking ` now is what we experience ' as a first principle in theoretical physics .      a primary practical motivation for studying such as the pot",
    ", records theory and histories theory is that quantum cosmology @xcite is not yet sufficiently developed at a conceptual level to provide a rigorous framework for inflationary scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which themselves have been argued to be useful not only through their various theoretical advantages over the plain big bang scenario but also through their good prediction of what the most recent cmb data should look like @xcite .",
    "it is via the above contact with testable assertions that hitherto philosophical contentions about qm ( in particular as applied to closed systems such as the whole universe ) may enter into mainstream physics .",
    "suggestions as to how one might approach such conceptual issues in quantum cosmology include @xcite .    how would a records theory perspective help with some of these issues ?",
    "\\0 ) one might consider such as cmb inhomogeneities or the pattern and spectra of galaxies to involve useful records .",
    "\\1 ) within a histories perspective , the decoherence process makes records , but information is in general lost in the making .",
    "e.g. halliwell @xcite has shown that mixed states necessarily produce imperfect records . furthermore , finding out where in the universe the information resides ( i.e. where the records are ) should be capable of resolving whether gravity decoheres matter or vice versa .",
    "finally , decoherence is habitually linked with the emergence of ( semi)classicality , so there may well be some bridge between records theory and the semiclassical approach .",
    "\\2 ) in barbour s approach , the gr universe is a collection of timeless records .",
    "one could then propose the semiclassical approach as providing the mechanism by which this description can nevertheless give a semblance of dynamics .",
    "a further idea of barbour s ( not yet backed by any evidence from mathematical models ) is that the arrow of time might emerge _ from _ records within a scheme that does not presuppose history .",
    "as regards us probably not knowing in any detail which theory is correct in the quantum gravity regime , note that histories and records frameworks in general are not theory - sensitive .",
    "this should be contrasted with how some particular internal time candidates are tied to particular ( families of ) theories .",
    "the semiclassical approach s position is likely intermediate in this respect  one would hope that the possibility of such an approximate regime is widespread among quantum gravity theories , albeit the rigorous justification of such a regime may depend on certain features not shared by all theories ( as speculated in @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if a theory has a useable notion of internal time , arranging that theory into a records theory form might be viewed as a formalism to be used for only some applications .",
    "the most well - known old arguments about the physics being in the correlations are specifically not referring to records theory .",
    "e.g. what wigner said on the subject is , in detail , ( @xcite p 145 )  _",
    "quantum mechanics only furnishes us with correlations between subsequent observations _ \" , and wheeler agreed with this ( @xcite p 295 ) .",
    "were one to wish to draw motivation from these statements , they would need to be rephrased and the original context would be lost .",
    "that records are more operationally meaningful than the histories of the other universal scheme has been argued along the following lines .",
    "the study of records is how one does science ( and history ) in practise , whether or not one ascribes reality to whatever secondary frameworks one reconstructs from this ( like histories , spacetimes or the local semblance of dynamics ) .",
    "unfortunately , _ as motivation _ , more careful inspection reveals this to be vague wordplay .",
    "this is because of the difference between the notion of records as in ( some of the sub)configurations that the system provides and the notion of records as in things which are localized , accessible and of significant information content . as effective reconstruction of history requires the subconfigurations in question to have these in general unestablished properties ,",
    "it is a _ question to address _ rather than a preliminary motivation to have that records are more operationally meaningful than histories through possessing good enough qualities to permit a meaningful such reconstruction .",
    "thus what one should do is 1 ) pin down where the  somewhere \" in ( 0 ) is ( the central motivation in some of halliwell s papers @xcite ) .",
    "2 ) determine whether the record thereat is useful ",
    "gell - mann ",
    "hartle assert that what they call records ",
    "_ may not represent records in the usual sense of being constructed from quasiclassical variables accessible to us _ \" ( p 3353 of @xcite ) .",
    "also , it may be that the @xmath1-particle track in the bubble chamber is atypical in its neatness and localization . for",
    ", bubble chambers are carefully selected environments for revealing tracks  much human trial and error has gone into finding a piece of apparatus that does just that .",
    "@xmath1-tracks being useful records could then hinge on this careful pre - selection , records in general then being expected to be poorer , perhaps far poorer , as suggested e.g. by the joos",
    " zeh paradigm of a dust particle decohering due to the microwave background photons .",
    "in this situation , records are exceedingly diffuse as the information is spread around by the cmb photons .",
    "see sec 5 and @xcite for more details .",
    "given the substantial technical difficulties of each canonical quantum gr strategy , it is worth considering conceptual questions for _ toy models_.      this has , as a simpler analogue of ( [ grham ] ) , a quadratic energy constraint ( q_i , p^i ) n_ijp^ip^j/2 + ( q^i ) - = 0 [ eno ] for @xmath18 a constant energy and @xmath19 the inverse constant diagonal mass matrix @xmath20 .",

    "[ tiseo ]      there are other mechanics that share more features with gr . consider the relational particle models ( rpm s ) in relative jacobi coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "these resemble gr in having 1 ) a quadratic energy constraint n_ijp^ip^j/2 + ( |r_i| ) - = 0 [ e ] and 2 ) a linear constraint , the zero angular momentum constraint , _ ^r_ip_i = 0 .",
    "[ zam ] the former is interpretable as a timeless equation and the latter as the physics being encoded in the relative separations and angles ( ` relational quantities ' ) rather than in any absolute angles .",

    "then at the quantum level , one has the quantum energy constraint    -n_ij + ( |r_i|)- = 0 , [ tise ] which is another tise analogue of the gr wde .",
    "one also obtains the quantum zero angular momentum constraint _",
    "^r_i= 0 [ qmzam ] i.e. that the wavefunction of the toy universe @xmath24 depending on relational quantities rather than on any absolute angles , and , in the scale - invariant case , the quantum zero dilational momentum constraint r_i= 0 .",
    "full reductions are available for 2d rpm s ( of which the scale - invariant one is better behaved ) allowing us to do quite a lot more with these particular models . @xcite .",

    "it should also be noted that this model is no longer a mere toy , at least for some purposes such as studying the origin of galaxies or of microwave background perturbations .",

    "reasons why subsumption 5 might not be adopted , or might not be a complete catch - all of what one would like to be explained include i ) impracticality : studying a subsystem s now involves studying a larger subsystem containing multiple imprints of s. models involving memories would be particularly difficult to handle ( see footnote 20 ) .",
    "ii ) if one wants a scheme that can explain the arrow of time , then page s scheme looks to be unsatisfactory . while single instants such as that in footnote 20 could be used to simulate the scientific process as regards ` becoming questions ' , it is noteworthy that these single instants correspond to the _ latest _ stage of the investigation ( in the ` becoming ' interpretation ) , while ` earlier instants ' will not have this complete information .",
    "iii ) additionally , important aspects of the scientific enterprise look to be incomplete in this approach  in interpreting present correlations , one is in difficulty if one can not affirm that one did in fact prime the measuring apparatus would appear to retain its importance .",
    "i.e. as well as the ` last instant ' playing an important role in the interpretation , initial conditions implicit in the ` first instant ' also look to play a role ( see also @xcite ) .      at the classical level , one could either take certainty to be a subcase of probability , or note that even classically it is probabilities that are relevant in practise ",

    "quite a lot of candidate objects of this kind have been proposed .",

    "e.g. for the observed distribution of monoliths or quasars , one would rather look for whether there are more quasi - alignments than is probable between each individual grouping of several objects .",
    "one would use e.g. the @xmath79-bluntness notion on all triples of points or other approaches by kendall .    as a second example",
    ", i consider the family of notions of correlator / n - point function that occur in cosmology , qft and indeed qft on a cosmological background .",
    "i consider the 2-point function for simplicity ( but the analysis readily generalizes to the n - point function ) . in classical cosmology , one works with the 2-point function for such as mass density or galaxy number density @xcite , t ( ) = ( or some integrated , angular or fourier - transformed version of this , the fourier transform being the well - known _ power spectrum _",
    "quantity ) .",
    "qm has an extra kind of correlations that classical theory does not have , due to entanglement .",
    "wigner functions are also available as tools at the quantum level ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ordinary ( minkowski spacetime ) qft has n - point functions of the same kind @xcite , where @xmath84 now includes inserting the ground - state wavefunction at each end .",
    "this notion carries over to n - point functions for a simple ` mukhanov variables qft ' picture of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the zalaletdinov correlation tensor ( a comparer ) @xcite applies to the more general inhomogeneous setting . on the one hand , these objects are higher moments , which indeed in general would be expected to carry more detail of structure than the above relative information quantities , but on the other hand it is not clear whether they can catch particular subtle details such as quasialignments between all triplets of included objects . @xcite has a useful treatment of correlators for quantum cosmology .",
    "timeless records theory concerns subconfigurations of a single instant .",
    "these subconfigurations ( ` the records ' ) are to be localized and only approximately known in order to be useable for study and in correspondence with what one meets in practise . the notion of ` approximately known '",
    "is underpinned more precisely by a notion of closeness on the configuration space and a notion of graining . ` configuration space ' above may be replaced by ` decorated ' versions such as configuration - velocity , configuration - direction or configuration - momentum ( phase ) space . for records to be useable , they need to contain enough of the right kind of information ( such as a common pattern , shared information , or correlations ) to furbish a deductive process .",
    "these features considered in this paper are useful ` groundwork ' for records theory , but addressing some questions of interest in quantum cosmology would require further ideas and structures to be built up . the paper has reviewed a number of notions of closeness , information content , information comparison and correlation that could provide records theory with formal mathematical machinery , but exactly which notions should be adopted is left open to be tested out in ongoing investigations @xcite with various explicit toy models . some economy of structure may be possible , in that i have shown how some versions of various different notions can be based on a common mathematical structure .",
    "records theory can manifestly cope with questions about ` being ' . as regards the other kinds of questions that one may have in dynamics / science / history",
    ", questions involving ` at a particular time ' can be supplanted by using ( part of ) the configuration to give meaning to and determine that notion of time .",
    "questions concerning ` becoming ' can in principle be rephrased as question of ` being ' , since the ` latest ' relevant instant will contain ( not necessarily useable ) memory - like records of the ` previous ' relevant instants , which would then be ` reconstructed ' .",
    "records would furthermore need to fulfill ` semblance of dynamics ' in order to explain the world we see .",
    "how this would come about goes beyond the scope of what this paper covers in detail ; see sec 7.3 for brief discussion .",
    "it is the following four arguments that motivate records theory .",
    "1 ) the problem of time ( pot ) in quantum gravity is an incompatibility between the roles played by ` time ' in gr and in qm .",
    "one conceptually clear way of dealing with this problem is to recast both gr and qm in a timeless mold .",
    "[ while the wheeler  dewitt equation s timelessness might specifically prompt some physicists toward timeless records theory , this equation has numerous technical problems and may not be trustworthy . nor should one turn to timeless records theory due to earlier detailed documentation of problems with the other pot approaches , but rather judge it due to its own merits and shortcomings ( sec 7.3 ) . ]",
    "2 ) one can in principle treat all of change , processes , dynamics , history and the scientific enterprise in these timeless terms ( but it is difficult in practise , and , at least by the scheme provided in this paper , this does not suffice to explain the arrow of time ) .",
    "3 ) records theory is of potential use in the foundations of quantum cosmology ( which is what inflationary theory is to rest on ) .",
    "4 ) records theory is ( alongside histories theory ) a universal scheme in that all types of theory or system admit a such ( but it may not always be a profitable approach to take , due to the above useable and useful criteria , which does some damage to the claim that records are more fundamental than histories ) .      what does it mean for a record to encode a semblance of dynamics ?",
    "how does a record achieve this encodement ?",
    "are subconfigurations that encode this generic ?",
    "let us suppose that this is actually a special rather than generic feature for a subconfiguration to have",
    ". this would be the case if the dust grain  cmb photon paradigm is more typical than the @xmath1-particle  bubble chamber one",
    ". then one would have the problem of explaining why the universe around us nevertheless contains a noticeable portion of noticeably history - encoding records , i.e. one would then need a _",
    "selection principle_.    barbour suggests a selection principle based on the following layers @xcite .",
    "1 ) there are some distinctive places in the configuration space .",
    "2 ) the wavefunction of the universe peaks around these places , making them probable .",
    "3 ) these parts of the configuration space contain records that bear a semblance of dynamics ( ` time capsules ' ) .",
    "[ following my arguments in this paper , this should be rephrased in terms of subconfigurations . ]",
    "the following doubts may be cast on this scheme .",
    "firstly , at least his earlier arguments @xcite , he suggests the wedge - shape of his representation of triangle land could play a role , but this is a representation - dependent rather than irreducible feature of triangle land , absent e.g. in the spherical representation .",
    "secondly , in modelling small atoms and cosmic strings @xcite , the effect on the dynamics of representation - invariant features such as stratifications , while non - negligible , only impart a small distortion on the wavefunction .",
    "thirdly , barbour supplies no concrete mathematical model evidence for there being any correlation between subconfigurations being time capsules and their being near a distinctive feature of configuration space such as a change of stratum or a point of great uniformity .",
    "semiclassicality might either explain or supplant barbour s selection principle ( it is regions in which the wkb ansatz happens to apply that have a semblance of time ? ) barbour agrees to some extent with this . additionally , there are two a priori unrelated selection principles in the literature , which could be viewed either as competitors or as features that barbour s scheme should be checked to be able to account for .",
    "\\i ) in the study of ( _ branching processes _ ) , one learns that barbour s ` how probable a subconfiguration is ' can depend strongly on the precise extent of the list of its contents . as an example ( closely paralleling reichenbach @xcite ) , suppose we see two patches of sand exhibiting hoof - shaped cavities . then past interactions of these two patches of sand with a third presently unseen subsystem  a horse that has subsequently become quasi - isolated from the two patches  is clearly capable of rendering the individually improbable ( low entropy and hence high information ) configurations of each patch of sand collectively probable ( high entropy , low information ) for the many sand patches  horse subsystem .",
    "this still does not explain why useful records appear to be common in nature : a separate argument would be needed to account for why branching processes are common .",
    "\\ii ) a selection principle for records might also arise as a knock - on from there being a ` consistency of histories within a graining ' selection principle in histories theory .",
    "perhaps not all record grainings correspond to projections of consistent history grainings . that the notion of inconsistent record grainings may not be absurd may follow from considering what one would obtain if one projected grainings in _ inconsistent _ histories theory .",
    "although , conceivably , selection could also be lost due to the projection , or be generated by the projection  if the consistent history involves filming and subsequently doctoring the tape , is that tape a consistent record ?",
    "investigation of barbour s selection principle could be done using a relational particle model complicated enough to have a distinctive curved configuration space geometry , such as the 3-particle 2d model or the 4-particle 1d scalefree one .",
    "this investigation would probably also benefit from comparison with parallel semiclassical approach and histories theory calculations .",
    "barbour favours his ` being ' perspective so as to be open to the possibility of explaining the arrow of time , while i ) , ii ) , castagnino s scheme @xcite ( which builds in a time asymmetry in the choice of admitted solutions ) , and page s scheme ( which is subject to the difficulties pointed out in sec 4.4 ) are not open to such a possibility .",
    "while specific examples will serve to strengthen our understanding of whether selection principles are necessary , how the semblance of dynamics is to be recovered and whether this permits an emergent rather than presupposed arrow of time , the context in which to assess whether records theory is a problem of time resolution is the fully generic one . limitations of records theory in this regard due to features exposed in this paper are as follows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "records are  somewhere in the universe that information is stored when histories decohere \" . but a suitable notion of localization in space and in configuration space may be hard to come by and/or to use for quantum gravity in general  ` where ' particular records are can be problematic to quantify , and the records can be problematic to access and use too , since the relevant information may be ` all over the place ' . also , ` information ' is problematic both as it may be of too poor a quality to reconstruct the history and because a suitably general notion of information is missing from our current understanding of classical gravity , never mind quantum gravity with its unknown microstates ( mechanical toy models are useful in not having this last obstruction ) . finally , the further records theory notions of significant correlation patterns and how one is to deduce dynamics / history from them looks to be a difficult and unexplored area even in simpler contexts than gravitation .",
