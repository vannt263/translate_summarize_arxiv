    "<S> , @xmath17 is the set of light rays from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and a set @xmath15 blocks the light from @xmath12 to @xmath13 if it completely shades @xmath12 away from @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple model ignores diffraction , the dual nature of light , and all aspects of quantum mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> a well known result of serre @xcite asserts that for compact @xmath0 and points @xmath18 , the set @xmath19 of geodesic segments joining @xmath20 and @xmath21 is always infinite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath22 is sometimes infinite and sometimes not . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are different points on the standard round sphere @xmath23 with distance less than @xmath24 , then @xmath25 consists of exactly two elements . </S>",

    "<S> the _ blocking number _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 for @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29    the study of blocking light ( also known as security ) seems to have originated in the study of polygonal billiard systems and translational surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . more recently , blocking light has been studied in riemannian spaces ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we give a characterization of the round sphere in terms of its blocking properties .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 are two distinct points in the standard round sphere @xmath23 closer than @xmath24 then , as remarked above , @xmath31 . this property does not characterize the round sphere amongst all closed riemannian manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , every compact rank one symmetric space , or cross for short , has the following property :    * _ cross blocking _ : for every distinct pair of points @xmath26 with @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from cross blocking , the round sphere also has the following property :    * _ sphere blocking _ : for every point @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the crosses are classified and consist of the round spheres @xmath23 , the projective spaces @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes one of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , or @xmath40 , and the cayley projective plane , each one endowed with its symmetric metric . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to check that the round sphere is the only cross with sphere blocking .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that a closed riemannian manifold with cross and sphere blocking is isometric to a round sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that this is the case :    [ thm : sphere ] a closed riemannian manifold @xmath0 has cross and sphere blocking if and only if @xmath0 is isometric to a round sphere .    in order to prove theorem [ thm : sphere ] we show that manifolds as in the statement are blaschke manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> recall that a compact riemannian manifold @xmath0 is said to be _ blaschke _ if its injectivity radius and diameter coincide . </S>",
    "<S> berger @xcite proved that a blaschke manifold diffeomorphic to the sphere is in fact isometric to a round sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this was used in @xcite to prove theorem [ thm : sphere ] for blaschke manifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite it was also conjectured that a closed riemannian manifold with cross blocking is isometric to a compact rank one symmetric space . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that this is the case in dimension two :    [ thm : surfaces ] a closed riemannian surface @xmath0 has cross blocking if and only if @xmath0 is isometric to a constant curvature sphere or projective plane .    </S>",
