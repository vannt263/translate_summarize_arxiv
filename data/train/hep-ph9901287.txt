    "after 6 years of running and major improvements of the electron proton collider machine , the experiments at hera start to open a new focus of physics analyses looking at processes with cross sections of the order of 1 pb and below .",
    "this is the typical value for cross sections at large values of bjorken @xmath0 and momentum transfer @xmath1 , or more generally of processes with large transverse momenta . at the upper limit of the available center - of - mass energy , the cross sections for deep inelastic scattering",
    "are equally determined by both electromagnetic and purely weak interactions .",
    "moreover , measurements are possible of rare standard model processes like the production of an additional gauge boson , or of radiative processes in neutral and charged current scattering .",
    "other examples are the production of lepton pairs or multi - jet systems with large invariant masses .",
    "these low cross section processes provide a wealth of possibilities to look for deviations from the standard model predictions and constitute important backgrounds for searches for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "new physics may be found in a search for processes which are forbidden in the standard model or have tiny cross sections much below the level of 1 pb ; some models of physics beyond the standard model predict such `` gold - plated '' , background - free signatures . however , more common is the situation that the cross section for conventional standard model processes are only slightly modified .",
    "the first task when searching for new physics is therefore to obtain a precise and detailed knowledge of standard model predictions . for deep inelastic scattering",
    "this task is twofold : on the one hand one has to provide precise parametrizations of parton distribution functions evolved in @xmath1 according to next - to - leading order of qcd . on the other hand , the cross sections for hard lepton - quark and lepton - gluon subprocesses have to be known also at least to next - to - leading order .",
    "the theoretical tools needed to solve the first part of the task are well - established and the precision of parton distribution functions depends mainly on the quality of experimental data @xcite . on the other hand , nlo calculations for hard subprocesses , while continuously improving , have not yet reached a completely satisfactory status @xcite .",
    "nlo calculations for inclusive scattering , i.e.  @xmath2 corrections to the structure functions ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and , in the @xmath5 scheme , @xmath6 ) are known since long @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has been made with respect to jet production in dis and photoproduction @xcite , but @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchange , relevant at large @xmath1 , is not taken into account in the available nlo monte carlo programs . only recently ,",
    "next - to - leading order corrections to the @xmath8 production @xmath9 , including resolved contributions to photoproduction , have been reported @xcite .",
    "calculations for nlo corrections to the production of isolated photons are available for deep inelastic scattering @xcite and for photoproduction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but the transition region of small and large @xmath1 has not yet been investigated . for other cases , like for example lepton pair production , nlo ,",
    "sometimes even lo , calculations are still missing .",
    "the demands for the precision of standard model predictions varies depending on the size of the cross section .",
    "for inclusive measurements in deep inelastic scattering one requires rather precise measurements when searching for new physics .",
    "specific final states , in particular when they contain one or two particles with high transverse energy , can be left at a precision of @xmath10 . for `` generic searches '' , where deviations from standard model predictions are looked for without referring to any specific expectations @xcite , a classification of `` interesting '' final states containing a high-@xmath11 charged lepton , large missing transverse momentum , or a high-@xmath11 jet , or any combination of them , would be helpful for a systematic investigation of experimental uncertainties .",
    "the motivation to search for new physics at hera has received a strong impetus by the observation of enhancements of cross sections at several places .",
    "the excess of events at large @xmath0 and large @xmath1 in neutral and charged current scattering @xcite has been discussed at lenght in the literature , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "notably the occurence of events with an isolated muon and large missing transverse momentum at h1 @xcite which are seemingly not a sign of @xmath8 production presents a challenge for the understanding of the experiments . also at other experiments data",
    "suggest themselves as an indication for the appearance of new physics .",
    "i would like to mention only the high-@xmath12 dijets at tevatron @xcite and the cross section for @xmath13 at lep2 which is too low at the highest @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case , the experiments find a suppression , not an enhancement , and it seems more difficult to find a scenario which predicts the necessary amount of interference with the standard model .",
    "it is therefore more wide - spread to believe that this is a statistical fluctuation , but the same can be the origin of all the other observations as well .",
    "probably the most strong hint for the presence of new physics is the experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite .    in the following , i selected some of the alternatives to standard model physics which",
    ", if realized in nature , have a good chance to be discovered at hera . if not",
    ", hera is expected to significantly contribute to setting limits on their respective model parameters .",
    "other topics of interest are discussed in @xcite .",
    "despite of the great success of the standard model , various conceptual problems provide a strong motivation to look for extensions and alternatives .",
    "two main classes of frameworks can be identified among the many new physics scenarios discussed in the literature :    * parametrizations of more general interaction terms in the lagrangian like contact interactions or anomalous couplings of gauge bosons are helpful in order to _ quantify the agreement _ of standard model predictions with experimental results . in the event that deviations",
    "are observed , they provide a framework that allows to relate different experiments and cross - check possible theoretical interpretations . being insufficient by themselves , e.g.  because they are not renormalizable , parametrizations are expected to show the directions to the correct underlying theory if deviations are observed .",
    "* models , sometimes even complete theories , provide specific frameworks that allow a consistent derivation of cross sections for conventional and new processes .",
    "examples are the two - higgs - doublet extension of the standard model , grand unified theories and , most importantly supersymmetry with or without @xmath15-violation .",
    "the following three examples attained most interest when the excess of large-@xmath1 events at hera was made public @xcite .",
    "i will try to point out some of the open questions worth to be studied in future theoretical research .",
    "the contact interaction ( ci ) scenario relevant for hera physics assumes that 4-fermion processes are modified by additional terms in the interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath16 similar terms with 4-quark interactions would be relevant for new physics searches at the tevatron and 4-lepton terms would affect purely leptonic interactions . in equation ( [ ci ] ) , as usual , only products of vector or axial - vector currents are taken into account since limits on scalar or tensor interactions are very stringent .",
    "such terms are motivated in many extensions of the standard model as effective interactions after having integrated out new physics degrees of freedom like heavy gauge bosons , leptoquarks and others , with masses beyond the production threshold .",
    "the normalization with the factor @xmath17 is reminiscent of models which predict ci terms emerging from strong interactions at a large mass scale @xmath18 . beyond their meaning as new physics effects , limits on the mass scale of contact interactions serve as an important means to quantify the agreement of experimental data with standard model predictions .",

    "the important advantage of the contact term approach is that it provides a framework which can be applied to all presently running high - energy experiments .",

    "the combination of results obtained in different experiments and from measurements with polarized beams @xcite will be helpful to identify the helicity structure of contact interaction terms .",
    "leptoquarks appear in extensions of the standard model involving unification , technicolor , compositeness , or @xmath36-parity violating supersymmetry .",

    "@xcite is based on the assumption that the yukawa interactions of leptoquarks should have the following properties :    * renormalizability * @xmath38 symmetry * conservation of baryon and lepton number * chirality of the couplings * couplings exist only to one fermion generation * no other interactions and/or particles exist    dropping one of the first two of these assumptions would lead to severe theoretical problems ; the other properties are dictated by phenomenology .",
    "one would certainly not like to give up assumption 3 since this avoids rapid proton decay .",
    "the chirality of couplings is necessary in order to escape the very strong bounds from leptonic pion decays and assumption 5 is a consequence of limits on fcnc processes .",
    "the last assumption is made for simplicity only ; it seems to be rather unlikely than realistic .",
    "these assumptions lead to a rather restricted set of allowed states and their branching fractions @xmath39 to a charged lepton final state can only be 1 , 0.5 , or 0 . those states which are interesting for hera phenomenology have @xmath40 and are excluded by tevatron bounds which require masses above 242 gev @xcite",
    ".    the leptoquark scenario might remain interesting if it is possible to generalize the approach by relieving one or more of the above assumptions @xcite , notably the last one of the list .",
    "the tevatron mass bounds are avoided if it was possible to adjust the branching ratios in the range @xmath41 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a scenario was proposed where two leptoquark states show mixing induced by coupling them to the standard model higgs boson .",
    "alternatively , interactions to new heavy fields might exist that , after integrating them out , could lead to leptoquark yukawa couplings as an effective interaction @xcite , bypassing this way renormalizability as a condition since this is assumed to be restored at higher energies . in the more systematic study of ref .",
    "@xcite , lq couplings arise from mixing of standard model fermions with new heavy fermions with vector - like couplings and taking into account a coupling to the standard model higgs . up to now",
    ", no attempt was made to study in a systematic way the possibility of relieving the assumption that no intergenerational couplings should exist ( see however ref .",
    "the most interesting extension of the generic leptoquark scenario is , however , @xmath42-violating supersymmetry which is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the present limits on the proton life - time do not forbid interactions of the form @xmath46 proportional to @xmath47 provided the @xmath48 are chosen to be zero at the same time .",
    "this makes squarks appear as leptoquarks which can be produced on resonance in lepton - quark scattering .",
    "in contrast to the generic leptoquark scenarios described above , @xmath42-conserving decays of squarks lead to a large number of interesting and distinct signatures ( see ref .   @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the branching ratios can be adjusted so as to avoid the strict mass limits from tevatron .",
