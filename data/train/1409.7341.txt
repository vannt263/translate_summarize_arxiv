    "<S> low - dimensional electron systems , as realized in layered materials , often tend to spontaneously break the symmetry of the underlying nuclear lattice by forming so - called density waves  @xcite ; a state of matter that currently attracts enormous attention  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we reveal a remarkable and surprising feature of charge density waves ( cdws ) , namely their intimate relation to orbital order . for the prototypical material 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1we not only </S>",
    "<S> show that the cdw within the two - dimensional tas@xmath2-layers involves previously unidentified orbital textures of great complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that two metastable stackings of the orbitally ordered layers allow manipulation of salient features of the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these orbital effects provide a route to switch 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1nanostructures from metallic to semiconducting with technologically pertinent gaps of the order of 200mev . </S>",
    "<S> this new type of orbitronics is especially relevant for the ongoing development of novel , miniaturized and ultra - fast devices based on layered transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> supercell structure of 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1 . * ( a ) and ( c ) : view along the @xmath3-axis and parallel to the @xmath4-planes , respectively ( @xmath5,@xmath6 : lattice vectors of the undistorted p@xmath7m1 crystal structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ta - displacements indicated by red arrows in ( a ) are mainly parallel to the @xmath4-planes , resulting in clusters containing 13 ta - sites . </S>",
    "<S> red dashed lines in ( c ) highlight the breathing of the s - sites perpendicular to the @xmath4-plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) : lda supercell band structure along the high symmetry direction in the brillouin zone shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gray lines indicate the unreconstructed band structure . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) : unfolded band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of bands measures the spectral weight at this position . </S>",
    "<S> arrows indicate the gaps at @xmath8 and between m and k which are commonly named mott - gap ( 1 ) and cdw - gap ( 2 ) , respectively . ]    among the various transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) , 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1stands out because of its particularly rich electronic phase diagram as a function of pressure and temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phase diagram not only features incommensurate , nearly commensurate and commensurate cdws , but also pressure - induced superconductivity below 5  kelvin . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , it was proposed early on that the low - temperature commensurate cdw ( c - cdw ) , which is illustrated in fig .  1  ( a),(c ) , also features many - body mott - physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence for the presence of mott - physics in 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1has indeed been obtained recently by time - resolved spectroscopies , which observed the ultra - fast collapse of a charge excitation gap , which has been interpreted as a fingerprint of significant electron - electron interactions  @xcite .    even though the above scenario for the c - cdw is widely accepted , important experimental facts remain to be understood : the very strong suppression of the c - cdw with external pressure is puzzling . already above 0.6  gpa , </S>",
    "<S> the c - cdw is no longer stable , although nesting conditions , band widths as well as the lattice structure remain essentially unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> it is also not clear how ordered defects within the c - cdw order , which emerge in the nearly commensurate phase ( nc - cdw ) upon heating  @xcite and which do not cause significant changes in the bandwidths , can render the electron - electron onsite interaction u completely ineffective  @xcite . in the following we will show that all these issues are explained consistently in terms of orbital textures that are intertwined with the cdw . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , we also demonstrate that this new twist to the physics of cdws also provides a new and powerful device concept for future applications based on tmds .        </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the c - cdw is its partially disordered stacking along the @xmath3-axis : characterizing the relative alignment of the c - cdw in adjacent @xmath4-planes in terms of stacking vectors @xmath9 , which connect the central ta - sites in successive layers ( cf . figs .  2  ( e ) and ( f ) ) </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath3-axis stacking is given by an alternation of @xmath10 with a random choice from the three symmetry equivalent vectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the different @xmath9on the electronic structure so far remained unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> our highly efficient dft approach ( see methods ) , however , enables us to study these effects for the first time within the local density approximation ( lda ) .    for our _ ab initio _ calculations , we chose two superstructures with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , which represent the two metastable types of stacking found experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated total energy for both superstructures differs only by a few mev , implying that these two stacking types are indeed metastable . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  1  </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) shows the band structures for the c - cdw with @xmath14 and the undistorted lattice , where the band dispersions are shown along high symmetry directions of the brillouin zone of the unmodulated structure ( fig .  1  ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in good agreement with previous dft results  @xcite , the band structure in the plane through @xmath8 , m and k is fully gapped and only along @xmath8-a a fermi level crossing occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a one - dimensional metal , in line with recent reports  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a major disadvantage of such supercell calculations is , however , that the additional backfolded bands only indicate for which momenta @xmath16 and energies @xmath17 electronic states exist . </S>",
    "<S> there is no information about the spectral weight of these states . </S>",
    "<S> exactly this information is provided by the so - called spectral function @xmath18  @xcite , which is the physically relevant quantity that can be accessed experimentally by   e.g. , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> an approximation for @xmath18 within dft , can be obtained using the so - called unfolding procedure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this unfolding procedure for the band structure shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1  ( d ) is presented in fig .  1  ( e ) , where the thickness of the individual bands reflects the spectral weight @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly visible that only a small fraction of the reconstructed band structure carries substantial spectral weight . unlike the bands in fig .  1  ( d ) </S>",
    "<S> , the unfolded band structure allows to clearly identify dispersing bands and , correspondingly , the size and location of energy gaps . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , our calculation yields two gaps around the fermi level e@xmath20 , indicated by arrows in fig .  1  ( e ) . the gap at @xmath8 is usually interpreted as a mott - gap due to the electron - electron interaction u  @xcite , while the gap between m and k fits well to the fermi surface nesting vector and is therefore commonly assigned to a cdw - gap due to the electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is very important to note here , that our calculations do not include any onsite interactions u. the fact that the gap at @xmath8 is obtained without including u is therefore surprising and already implies that this gap can not be caused by mott - physics alone .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 we compare the unfolded lda band structures for @xmath14 and @xmath21 , which yields the first major result of this study : the dramatic dependence of the electronic structure on the cdw - stacking . </S>",
    "<S> as can be observed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2  ( c ) and ( d ) , essential features of the low - energy electronic structure depend critically on the stacking . </S>",
    "<S> most notably the bands around the @xmath8-point are strongly affected . </S>",
    "<S> while for @xmath22 the in - plane dispersions show e@xmath20-crossings along @xmath8-k and @xmath8-m , both crossings are completely absent for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a transition from an in - plane metal to an in - plane semiconductor occurs as a function of @xmath9 . considering that the @xmath4-planes of 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1are usually thought to realize strongly two - dimensional metallic systems , these are most surprising results . the comparison of the two dft models to the arpes data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2  ( a ) shows that the calculation for @xmath22 describes the experiment very well for binding energies below -0.3  ev . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also obvious that both dft models fail to describe the electronic states close to e@xmath20and , in particular , the pseudo - gap observed experimentally  @xcite . including an onsite u at ta does not cure this discrepancy , implying that these effects are beyond lda+u . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the strong @xmath9-dependence of the electronic structure suggests that these deviations are related to the stacking disorder in the real material  @xcite , which can not be taken into account by our dft - models . while this issue certainly deserves scrutiny in future work , here we focus on determining the origin of the dramatic effects of @xmath23 .    to this end </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the charge density distribution of the uppermost occupied states in real space . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in fig .  3 , for both stackings a complex orbital texture within the @xmath4-plane emerges . </S>",
    "<S> this is the second major result of this work : the discovery of an orbital texture that is intertwined with a cdw . </S>",
    "<S> note that not only the occupancy of a certain type of orbital changes spatially . </S>",
    "<S> instead also the symmetry of the orbitals clearly changes from site to site , resulting in a complex orbital ordering pattern . the orbital structure for @xmath14 permits significant charge hopping only along @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3  ( e ) . in other words , the charges flow along orbital stripes along @xmath3 , corresponding to the quasi one - dimensional character of the uppermost band in fig .  3  ( a ) and fig .  2  ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this drastically changes in the case of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> now there is a significant @xmath4-component of the hopping as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) , so that the uppermost band attains a larger in - plane dispersion and crosses e@xmath20along </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8-m and @xmath8-k ( figs .  3  ( b ) and 2  ( c ) ) .    . </S>",
    "<S> the energy window used to calculate the energy - resolved electron density is indicated by the green area . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) : a complex orbital texture emerges within the @xmath4-plane for @xmath24 ( c ) and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) , view of the @xmath26-plane corresponding to the red areas in ( c ) and ( d ) . ( e ) : for @xmath24 significant hopping is allowed only along the @xmath3-direction . </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) : a substantial @xmath4-component of the hopping appears for @xmath25 . ]    these results have important consequences : firstly , the comparison of the arpes data and the dft results shows that the @xmath8-gap is obtained on a quantitative level without an onsite repulsion u on ta . </S>",
    "<S> although this result does not exclude the presence of electron - electron interactions , it strongly argues against u being the main cause for the @xmath8-gap . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the band structure calculations reveal that this gap is for a large part due to the interlayer hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is in turn mostly caused by the @xmath27-type orbitals pointing along @xmath3 , i.e. , the @xmath8-gap is directly coupled to the orbital texture . </S>",
    "<S> this result naturally explains the ultra - fast response of this gap observed in time - resolved arpes experiments , since the disruption and reordering of the electronic orbitals can evolve on much faster time - scales than the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the presence of orbital textures explains the strong pressure dependence of the cdw - order in 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1 , because through the orbital texture pressure has a large effect on the stability of cdw - phases with different stackings in a way that goes well beyond traditional nesting scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress that the crucial role of the interlayer interactions is verified experimentally by the data in fig .  2  ( b ) , which shows that the stacking changes completely across the c - cdw / nc - cdw transition . </S>",
    "<S> this change in stacking together with our dft - results also rationalizes the collapse of the gap at @xmath8 upon entering the nc - cdw with warming .    </S>",
    "<S> -tas@xmath1with @xmath28 ( a ) and @xmath29 ( b ) . a semiconductor - to - metal transition takes place upon changing the stacking of the two layers . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) : orbital order corresponding to the semiconducting ( top ) and metallic state ( bottom ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly and most importantly , the relative orientation of the orbitals in adjacent @xmath4-planes has a spectacular effect on the band dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily understood in terms of the overlap integrals , which depend critically on the relative orientation of the orbitals in adjacent layers along @xmath3 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> figs .  2  ( e),(f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above immediately yields a new device concept , which employs metastable orbital orders for controlling the electronic structure of nanostructures : as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 for a bilayer of 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1 , switching between the metastable orbital configurations causes a complete semiconductor - metal transition . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , by changing the orbital order in the direction _ </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular _ to the layers , one can control the conductivity _ </S>",
    "<S> parallel _ to the layers . </S>",
    "<S> even though this effect has not yet been observed directly , a very recent experiment provides first evidence that this might be achieved reversibly and on ultra - fast timescales using optical laser pulses  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> orbital textures hence enable to manipulate the band dispersion and gap structure of 1@xmath0-tas@xmath1 in a very effective way . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore provide a new route to tailor and switch the electronic properties of tmds , possibly on the femtosecond time scale . </S>",
    "<S> this concept of orbitronics may hence enable to create novel , small and ultra - fast electronics , which adds to the large potential of tmds for future device applications . </S>"
