    "detailed knowledge of the solar interior has been obtained by means of precise measurements of its acoustic ( p ) eigenmodes and the subsequent structural inversions , providing the stratification of crucial variables like the sound speed down to  0.05 @xmath3 .",
    "however , the acoustic modes are less sensitive to other structural variables such as the density . in this case , the agreement with the models is still poor in the deepest layers of the radiative zone @xcite .",
    "moreover the dynamical properties of the solar interior are practically unknown in the nuclear core . indeed , due to the limitation in the number of acoustic modes penetrating this region and to their low sensitivity there , the solar rotation profile ( see fig .",
    "[ rota ] ) is very uncertain below 0.2 @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at these depths ,",
    "large uncertainties also exist because of their lack of sensitivity . on the contrary , solar gravity ( g )",
    "modes exclusively provide information on the radiative region and the inner core .",
    "they are required to obtain a complete picture of the interior of our sun .",
    "unfortunately , solar g modes have not yet been clearly detected although extensive and intensive searches have been developed along past decades .",
    "these modes are evanescent in the convective zone and their amplitudes at the solar surface could be very small @xcite . to look for the g modes , two complementary ways of searching strategies",
    "have been developed during the last decades :    * the first method consists in looking for individual modes ( relevant spikes in the fourier spectrum of the observed signal ) above a given statistical threshold ( typically 90 @xmath2 confidence level ) at frequencies above 150 @xmath0hz .",
    "the first studies from the golf ( global oscillations at low frequency ) team @xcite and the phoebus @xcite and bison ( birmingham solar oscillations network , @xcite ) groups looked for individual peaks ( spikes ) .",
    "an upper limit of 1  cm / s has been found for these single peaks .",
    "another study of the golf data was devoted to the search for multiplets  instead of individual peaks  which has lowered the detection level to more than a half .",
    "two candidates have been observed and followed with time with more than 90% confidence level in a 20 @xmath0hz interval @xcite and one of them has even been detected with a 98% confidence level after  3000 days of observations in a 10 @xmath0hz interval @xcite .",
    "however , some ambiguity remains on the proper labelling of the detected components , in term of their @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 values .",
    "nevertheless , some scenarios have been proposed in order to explain the visible peaks which can constrain the physics and dynamics of the solar core .",
    "indeed , the frequencies of such modes are extremely sensitive to the structural properties of the radiative zone , including the problem of the solar abundances @xcite . *",
    "an alternative way , developed in the early 80s , is to look for the g - mode asymptotic properties ( see for example @xcite and references there in ) : this theory predicts a constant separation ( in period ) between the central components of the gravity modes at low frequency .",
    "[ frec_teor ] shows the separation in period of consecutive g modes ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 and periods below 11 hours , as a function of the period computed from a seismic solar model @xcite assuming a rigid core rotation @xcite .",
    "the effect of the rotation is to split the modes into different @xmath4-components regularly spaced in frequency . as a consequence , only zonal ones , @xmath4=0 , are equidistant in period while the others shift progressively as the period of the modes increases .",
    "consequently , this method becomes extremely sensitive to the rotation rate of the inner solar layers .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the framework of the phoebus collaboration @xcite , we have applied the same methodology to 3473 days of the sum of the 3 spm channels of the virgo experiment .",
    "unfortunately , no clear structures appear in the ps .",
    "this can be a consequence of the different solar background comparing disk - integrated velocity and intensity data .    in order to go a step",
    "further , we put to zero all the points above or below a given threshold before computing the ps .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ virgo ] shows the maximum of the highest peak between 22 and 26 in the ps when the level of the threshold is continuously increased ( or decreased ) .",
    "for example , the maximum is between 2 and @xmath8 4 when we put to zero all the points above a threshold changing from 2 to 9 ( continuous line in the figure ) .",
    "however , when we remove those peaks in the ps with lower power ( less than the threshold , dashed line in the figure ) we see that for a threshold between 5.5 and 6.5 , we have a peak in the studied region with an amplitude of @xmath9 .",
    "right panel of fig .",
    "[ virgo ] shows the ps computed from a psd where only peaks with s / n ratios within the range 5.5 to 10 have been considered . a similar peak - structure to those found using golf data",
    "can be clearly seen between 22 - 26 min .",
    "the pattern seems to be larger than the golf one . as a consequence of the threshold",
    "done , only 50 bins in the psd are responsible for this structure ( the psd of the virgo data between 25 and 140 @xmath0hz has more than 32000 points ) .",
    "thus , a visual identification of these peaks can be directly done in the psd .",
    "further studies should be carried out by the phoebus group before fully understand the virgo / spm data .",
    "if the signal is confirmed , it rules out a golf instrumental origin .",
    "however , as both instruments are on the same spatial platform an external confirmation ( i.e. bison or gong data ) would be extremely useful .",
    "finally , the deep study of the non disk - integrated mdi / soho data would bring the opportunity to access higher degree modes with new valuable information on the inner core .",
    "in the present work we have shown the presence of periodic signals in the psd of the golf spectrum when it is expressed in period .",
    "we have shown by the monte carlo simulations that it is very unlikely that these patterns were due to pure noise with 99.49 @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "assuming that it is due to g - mode signals , it can only be produced by the presence of @xmath1=1 modes with @xmath10 .",
    "a direct comparison with theoretical g modes showed that the @xmath11 hypothesis can be rejected with more than 99.86@xmath2 confidence level .    from this analysis",
    "we start to have access to the dynamics of the internal core and we have shown that the core seems to rotate in average between 3 to 5 times faster than the rest of the radiative zone when unrealistic `` rotation - step '' profile is used . more work should be done in the future to introduce more realistic core rotation law profiles and also to use the information corresponding to the higher degree modes",
    ".    another important consequence of the analysis performed here is that the individual structure of the g - mode multiplets should be more complicated than what , up to now , has been thought . to simulate realistic psd ( low s / n )",
    "we need a higher number of bins containing signal .",
    "as we have seen , at least , three different scenarios are compatible with a significant reduction of the required s / n .",
    "further studies will be necessary to discriminate between them and to improve our knowledge of this modes .",
    "the golf experiment is based upon a consortium of institutes ( ias , cea / saclay , nice and bordeaux observatories from france , and iac from spain ) involving a large number of scientists and engineers , as enumerated in @xcite .",
    "soho is a mission of international cooperation between esa and nasa .",
    "the authors thank t. appourchaux and w.j .",
    "chaplin for useful discussion and comments and all the phoebus group for providing the virgo / spm data ."
