    ", the particles must satisfy the minimum image convention , which requires the presence of the extra terms in the helfand moment ( [ helfand ] ) involving the jumps @xmath10 of the particles to fulfil the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath11 are the times of the jumps .",
    "@xmath12 is the momentum at the time @xmath11 of the jump . in eq .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) , the average @xmath13 is taken in the equilibrium microcanonical ensemble for which @xmath14      the central object of the escape - rate formalism is the fractal repeller which is composed of the phase - space trajectories for which the helfand moment fluctuates forever ( in the future and the past ) within some interval : @xmath15 these trajectories are exceptional because the helfand moment escape out of this interval for almost all the trajectories .",
    "therefore , the repeller has a vanishing probability measure in the phase space albeit it is typically composed of a nonenumerable set of trajectories .",
    "the repeller thus typically forms a fractal in the phase space @xcite .",
    "we set up a first passage problem of the helfand moment by introducing absorbing boundaries at @xmath16 .",
    "these absorbing boundaries in the space of variations of the helfand moment correspond to equivalent absorbing boundaries in the phase space of the system . in the phase space ,",
    "the absorbing boundaries delimit a domain which contains the fractal repeller .",
    "we consider a statistical ensemble of initial conditions taken inside this domain and we run their trajectories .",
    "when a trajectory reaches the absorbing boundaries it escape out of the domain and it thus removed out of the statistical ensemble .    under the forward time evolution ,",
    "the remaining trajectories belong to the stable manifolds of the repeller . under the backward time evolution ,",
    "the remaining trajectories belong to the unstable manifolds of the repeller . under both the forward and backward time evolution ,",
    "the remaining trajectories belong to the repeller itself which is the intersection of its stable and unstable manifolds @xcite . for a typical chaotic dynamics , almost all trajectories escape out of the domain after some time so that the repeller as well as its stable or unstable manifolds are fractal objects .",
    "these fractals can be generated by allowing the escape of trajectories over a long but finite time interval . over a finite time",
    ", there remain a sizable set of trajectories , which progressively reduces to the fractal as the time interval becomes longer and longer .",
    "the number of trajectories in the set ( or statistical ensemble ) decays with time . typically , the decay is exponential and characterized by the so - called escape rate @xmath17 .",
    "the escape rate @xmath17 can be evaluated by solving the first passage problem of the helfand moment by introducing absorbing boundaries at @xmath18 . indeed , the einstein - helfand equation ( [ einstein ] ) shows that the helfand moment performs a diffusive - like random walk .",
    "accordingly , the helfand moment can be considered as a random variable @xmath19 for which the probability density @xmath20 obeys to a diffusion - type equation @xcite : @xmath21 where the role of the diffusion coefficient is played by the shear viscosity ( [ einstein ] ) itself . at the absorbing boundaries ,",
    "the probability density must satisfy the absorbing boundary conditions : @xmath22 the solution of the diffusion - type equation ( [ fokker - planck ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ abc.p ] ) is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 and where the coefficient @xmath25 depend on the initial probability density .",
    "the number @xmath26 of trajectories remaining between the absorbing boundaries at the current time @xmath27 is related to the probability density by : @xmath28 after a long time , the escape is dominated by the smallest decay rate , @xmath29 , which can therefore be identified with the escape rate @xmath17 . in this way , we obtain the _ escape rate _ as a function of @xmath2 : @xmath30 this result is obtained by using the diffusion - type equation ( [ fokker - planck ] ) which is expected to hold over spatial distances larger than the mean free path of the particles .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath2 must be sufficiently large so that the helfand moment is in a diffusion regime and eq .",
    "( [ fokker - planck ] ) holds .",
    "the shear viscosity coefficient can thus be obtained from the escape rate which depends on the parameter @xmath2 of separation between the absorbing boundaries as @xmath31 in the following we call eq .",
    "( [ visc - esc ] ) the escape - transport formula .      at the microscopic level of description ,",
    "the escape rate is controlled by the fractal repeller @xmath4 which is composed of all the trajectories which satisfy the condition ( [ abc ] ) under forward and backward time evolution .",
    "the repeller is the support of a natural invariant probability measure .",
    "this invariant measure is natural because it is generated by the dynamics and can be approximated by a statistics based on the trajectories remaining within the absorbing boundaries after a long but finite time .",
    "the dynamics on the fractal repeller is characterized by positive lyapunov exponents and a ks entropy , both evaluated with respect to the natural invariant measure of the repeller .",
    "if the dynamics is unstable some lyapunov exponents are positive .",
    "if the dynamics is chaotic the ks entropy is positive . on a repeller ,",
    "the sum of positive lyapunov exponents differs from the ks entropy and the difference gives the escape rate @xmath32 of the repeller @xmath4 : @xcite @xmath33 if we combine this result from dynamical systems theory with eq .",
    "( [ visc - esc ] ) , we obtain the chaos - transport formula ( [ esc.eq ] ) for viscosity as originally derived by dorfman and gaspard @xcite .",
    "an equivalent formula can be obtained which involves the partial fractal dimensions of the repeller instead of the ks entropy .",
    "indeed , the fractal character of the repeller is a direct consequence of the escape of trajectories so that the ks entropy is no longer equal to the sum of lyapunov exponents but to @xmath34 where the coefficients are the partial information dimensions of the repeller associated with each unstable direction of corresponding lyapunov exponent @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "these partial dimensions satisfy @xmath36 so that the ks entropy is in general smaller than the sum of positive lyapunov exponents . accordingly",

    "( [ visc - esc ] ) , the shear viscosity is given by @xmath39 in the limit @xmath3 , the lyapunov exponents reach their equilibrium values @xmath40 , while the codimensions vanish typically as @xmath41 if transport is normal .",

    "( [ visc - codim ] ) provides a decomposition of the viscosity coefficient on the spectrum of lyapunov exponents such as @xmath43 typically , the escape is most important in the most unstable direction corresponding to the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the repeller is more depleted in the most unstable direction and the corresponding partial dimension @xmath45 is lower than the further ones .",
    "this reasoning suggests that a typical behavior is @xmath46 for @xmath3 if the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath44 is well defined .",
    "this is precisely the case in two - degree - of - freedom systems such as the two - disk model where the chaos - transport formula reduces to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the unique positive mean lyapunov exponent and @xmath49 the corresponding codimension which should be understood as the partial information codimension of the unstable manifolds of the fractal repeller given in terms of the partial information dimension by young s formula @xcite @xmath50 it is known that the partial information dimension of the repeller is well approximated by the partial hausdorff dimension if the escape rate is small enough and if ruelle s topological pressure does not present a discontinuity .",
    "this last condition is fulfiled if the system does not undergo a dynamical phase transition , which is the case in the finite - horizon regimes of sinai s billiard which controls the dynamics of both the lorentz gas and the two - disk model @xcite . under these conditions",
    ", we can replace the partial information codimension by the partial hausdorff codimension in the chaos - transport formula and obtain the viscosity as @xmath51 in the limit @xmath3 , the lyapunov exponent converges to its equilibrium value so that we can also write : @xmath52 under similar conditions as eq .",

    ", the transport properties could be studied for nanoscopic systems of increasing size in a similar way as the equilibrium thermodynamic properties have been studied in nanoscopic systems as a function of their size .",
