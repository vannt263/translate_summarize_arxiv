    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems occupy a unique place in the realm of many - body quantum mechanics , due in particular to the loosened distinction between the behavior of fermions and bosons with hard - core repulsive interaction .",
    "electronic transport properties in quasi-1d have been extensively investigated in various systems such as fractional quantum hall edge states @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , conducting conjugated polymer nanowires @xcite , and semiconductors nanowires @xcite .",
    "also quasi-1d bosonic systems realized with ultracold atoms confined in cigar - shaped traps have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "more recently , 1d quantum mechanics has been predicted to play a crucial role for the characterization of @xmath0he atoms confined inside nanopores @xcite or moving inside dislocation lines in crystalline helium samples @xcite .",
    "the low - energy properties of a vast class of 1d systems , including liquid @xmath0he , are well captured by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory ( tll ) @xcite .",
    "the tll theory is an effective low - energy field theory governed by an exactly solvable quadratic hamiltonian that depends only on two parameters , namely the sound velocity @xmath6 and luttinger parameter @xmath7 , which characterize the large - distance behavior of the correlation functions and the thermodynamic properties of the system . for spinless galilean - invariant systems , as the ones we are going to consider here , these two parameters are related via @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi velocity of a 1d ideal fermi gas with the same density @xmath10 of the system .",
    "thus the properties of the system depends only on a single parameter , @xmath7 , that turns out to be proportional to the square root of the compressibility @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "since the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite prevents the existence of bose - einstein condensation in 1d systems with short - range velocity - independent interaction , the standard picture of superfluidity relying on the order parameter provided by the condensate wavefunction @xcite has to be generalized @xcite .",
    "however , in the tll phase , correlation functions feature a power - law decay @xcite and the system is superfluid in the sense that it displays a quasi - off - diagonal long - range order @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we characterize the dynamical properties of 1d liquid @xmath0he by computing the friction or drag force , @xmath2 , exerted on a particle of mass @xmath13 moving with velocity @xmath3 inside the system , which provides a generalization of landau s celebrated criterion of superfluidity @xcite .",
    "we determine also the static density response function , @xmath4 , which is of paramount importance for the response of the system to a periodic potential , relevant for the interpretation of experiments @xcite and for density functionals theories @xcite .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath4 are obtainable from the knowledge of the dynamical structure factor , @xmath1 , that we have recently achieved via an _ ab - initio _ full microscopic approach @xcite , by combining the genetic inversion via falsification of theories ( gift ) algorithm @xcite to perform the analytic continuation of imaginary - time correlation functions computed via the exact zero - temperature path integral ground state ( pigs ) method @xcite .",
    "according to landau @xcite , an obstacle in a fluid , moving with velocity @xmath3 , may cause transitions from the ground state to excited states lying on the line @xmath14 in the energy - momentum space .",
    "if all the spectrum is above this line , the motion can not excite the system , and the flow of the impurity is frictionless . however , even when the line intersects the spectrum , the transition probabilities to these states can be strongly suppressed due to the interaction or to the external perturbing potential . in this case",
    ", the drag force provides a quantitative measure of superfluidity .",
    "the drag force , @xmath2 , exerted on an impurity moving with velocity @xmath3 in a 1d medium , can be computed relying on fermi s golden rule , by expressing the energy loss per unit time due to the impurity , @xmath15 , as @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the rate for the scattering process , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the fourier transform of the impurity - medium interaction @xmath20 . for a heavy impurity , @xmath21 ,",
    "simplifies to : @xmath22 equation shows that knowledge of @xmath1 and of @xmath23 grants the ability of computing the drag force .",
    "the relationship between the concept of drag force and landau s criterion for superfluidity is readily understood : if @xmath1 is concentrated above the straight line @xmath24 in the momentum - energy plane , then @xmath25 for all velocities @xmath26 . on the other hand , the integral can be very small or vanish even if the spectrum lies below the line @xmath24 , but the excitation probabilities are suppressed @xcite , for instance because @xmath23 takes non - zero values only in a finite region of momentum space . in a broad class of 1d systems , like the ideal fermi gas ,",
    "@xmath0he at high density @xcite and hard rods @xcite , @xmath1 touches the @xmath27 line with finite weight at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the fermi wave - vector ) , whence the possibility of a dissipationless flow is by no means obvious .     as a function of the ratio @xmath30 , compared to the luttinger liquid theory prediction for small @xmath3 ( solid lines ) and normalized to the maximum value @xmath31 .",
    "( color figure online).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to compute the drag force ( [ eq : dragformula ] ) , we have approximated @xmath23 by using a contact potential with the same scattering length of the repulsive part of the @xmath0he interaction ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the @xmath1 estimated in ref .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : drag ] .",
    "we observe an increase of @xmath2 with the velocity , and a saturation to a maximum value @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "the increase is consistent with luttinger liquid theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a slow impurity @xmath33 , the most important contribution to comes from the region @xmath34 . as shown in ref.@xcite , for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath1 has the power - law behavior : @xmath37 being @xmath38 , with the constraint @xmath39 . inserting into yields the following expression for the drag force : @xmath40 for @xmath33 ,",
    "the approximation @xmath41 is accurate and one finds @xmath42 @xcite , that compares satisfactory with our estimates of @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that the drag force is non - vanishing at any @xmath3 , but for @xmath43 its power - law behavior determines a superfluid response of the system , allowing for impurities to flow with very small dissipation @xcite .",
    "our estimate of @xmath2 is perturbative , therefore it is relevant for soft impurities such as small geometry deformations in quasi-1d systems .",
    "it is clear that for hard - core impurities ( like @xmath44he pinned to @xmath0he dislocations @xcite ) the superfluid response is completely suppressed .",
    "the static density response function characterizes the effect of a static periodic perturbation on a homogeneous system @xcite , and can be computed relying on the hellman - feynman theorem @xcite or from the first negative moment , @xmath45 , of @xmath1 : @xmath46 our results are shown in fig . [ fig : chiq ] .     in units of the inverse fermi energy @xmath47 , as function of @xmath5 in units of @xmath48 .",
    "small horizontal lines at @xmath49 correspond to the asymptotic estimate based on the feynman approximation .",
    "the static response function for the ideal fermi gas ( ifg ) and the free particle limit ( fp ) are also reported as solid lines .",
    "( color figure online).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the low - momentum regime , according to the tll theory the dynamical structure factor is concentrated around the dispersion relation @xmath50 , and the feynman approximation @xmath51 can be safely assumed , with @xmath52 .",
    "therefore : @xmath53 being @xmath54 the fermi energy .",
    "this relation is equivalent to the well known compressibility sum rule obeyed by @xmath4 in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the resulting values for the different considered densities are reported as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiq ] , instead of the obtained @xmath4 , that at low momenta is plagued by frequency - discretization effects unavoidable with the actual implementation of gift .    as clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiq ] , @xmath4 features peaks at momenta which are integer multiples of @xmath48 , at the densities @xmath55  @xmath56 and @xmath57  @xmath56 , where @xmath7 is found to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively @xcite .",
    "the presence of such peaks can be easily justified in the light of the tll theory , with the following heuristic argument .",
    "assuming that @xmath1 has the low - frequency power - law divergence @xmath60 at @xmath61 @xcite , and has support above the energy @xmath62 of the supercurrent state obtained applying a boost of momentum @xmath63 to the ground state @xcite , one can easily prove @xcite the presence of peaks in @xmath64 : @xmath65 because @xmath66 diverges for @xmath67 in the thermodynamic limit . applying the same argument",
    "to @xmath45 shows that : @xmath68 diverging in the thermodynamic limit provided that @xmath69 .",
    "equation explains the presence of peaks in @xmath70 at the density @xmath71  @xmath56 , and in @xmath72 at @xmath73  @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath1 of 1d bose systems with repulsive interaction manifests a pseudo particle - hole , typical of fermi systems , due to a peculiar interplay between dimensionality and repulsion @xcite .",
    "this suggests that also @xmath4 should display a behavior similar to the static density response function of the ideal fermi gas , known also as static lindhard function @xcite , that we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiq ] as a solid line . in the large @xmath5 limit ,",
    "our results collapse on the asymptotic behavior @xmath74 as expected also in higher dimensions ( free particle limit ) @xcite .",
    "we addressed the calculation of linear response functions of one - dimensional @xmath0he , relying on state - of - art quantum monte carlo calculations of the dynamical structure factor of the system .",
    "in particular , we estimated the force experienced by an impurity moving through the sample and weakly interacting with the helium atoms .",
    "this calculation is very interesting since it addresses the fate of the celebrated landau criterion for superfluidity in a scenario in which the mermin - wagner theorem rules out the possibility of bose einstein condensation .",
    "our results display a power - law behavior of the drag force as a function of the velocity of the impurity , showing thus a quasi - superfluid response of the system , consistently with the luttinger liquid paradigm .",
    "we also computed the static density response function @xmath4 of the system , providing the linear response of the helium atoms to an external periodic potential . for interacting quantum systems , this property is notoriously hard to access , requiring either the estimation of dynamical properties or the introduction of an external potential @xcite .",
    "we suggest interpretation of our data relying on known properties of the dynamical structure factor @xmath1 , such as the compressibility sum rule in the @xmath75 limit and the free - particle @xmath76 limit .",
    "varying the density , we observe a crossover from a dilute regime with a smooth static density response function to a quasi - solid high - density regime , where @xmath4 displays peaks whose height increases with the size of the system .    we hope that our results will stimulate further research in the field of the study of dynamical properties of one - dimensional systems , and that our findings can provide useful insight for the study of @xmath0he atoms confined inside nanopores or moving inside dislocation lines in crystalline helium samples .",
