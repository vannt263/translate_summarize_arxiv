    "it is a widely accepted convention today in the scientific community to write scientific papers using the tex  and latex  environments .",
    "the high quality , publication - style typesetting of latex  has made it now a de facto standard , to such an extent that some scientific journals only accept submission of papers in electronic form anymore . the portability goal of tex   has however the drawback that graphical representations are only possible in very rudimentary form ( using the latex  picture environment or packages using a similar approach ) .",
    "useful as they are , mostly they are too simple to draw complicated feynman diagrams as needed in wide parts of theoretical nuclear and particle physics today .",
    "this problem has led to the development of more sophisticated programs in the past .",
    "the lists four possibilities to draw feynman diagrams in conjunction with latex : michael levine s feynman  @xcite bundle ; jos vermaseren s",
    "axodraw  @xcite package which uses postscript specials and is thus slightly less portable but much more powerful ; thorsten ohl s feynmf  @xcite package for latex2e which uses metafont ( or metapost ) to combine flexibility and portability ; and norman gray s package .",
    "these are all available from the archives .",
    "powerful as they are , all these methods have the common drawback that they require some hard - coding from the user side , there does not exist any graphical user interface while modern day drawing programs do not include special options that are necessary to draw feynman diagrams with the same quality as the one achieved by tex / latex .",
    "our program jaxodraw is an attempt to close that gap .",
    "as the name suggests , it was initially meant to be a graphical user interface for jos vermaseren s axodraw package , but it may be used independently of it . however , it is in conjunction with axodraw that jaxodraw develops its main capabilities because of the possibility to combine the powers of tex / latex  with a modern drawing program .",
    "the main design goal of jaxodraw was convenience and ease - of - use ; it should be possible for anybody to draw even complicated feynman diagrams with just a few mouse clicks , without the knowledge of any programming language .",
    "jaxodraw was written in java , which means that ( in principle ) it can be used on any platform where a java runtime environment is installed .",
    "this makes it completely portable , even though in the present version , the program includes the execution of some external commands that are inherently system dependent and currently only work under certain operating systems .",
    "this paper attempts to give a complete overview of jaxodraw from installation and usage instructions to documentation issues and possible developments .",
    "jaxodraw is a feynman graph plotting tool written in java .",
    "it has a complete graphical user interface that allows all actions to be carried out via mouse point - and - click - and - drag operations .",
    "graphs may be exported to postscript / eps format and can be saved in xml files to be used for later sessions .",
    "one of jaxodraw s main features is the possibility to create latex  files which make use of j. vermaseren s axodraw package to create a feynman diagram via latex and dvips .",
    "it was in fact the main motivation to write jaxodraw , to create a graphical user interface for the axodraw package .    a few of jaxodraw s main features are :    * complete point - and - click graphical user interface . * pre - defined line styles for common particle representations . * saving and reading of sessions in xml format . *",
    "export to postscript , eps and latexformat . *",
    "setting of permanent preferences .",
    "the home of jaxodraw sources and documentation is :    ` http://altair.ific.uv.es/~jaxodraw/home.html ` ,    please refer to this page for ( hopefully ) up to date information .",
    "+ there is also a direct link to the jaxodraw home page in the web page of the physics department of the university of valencia :      you may download jaxodraw in three different forms ( xxx denotes the version number and platform type ) :    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "we are grateful to prof .",
    "arcadi santamaria for numerous helpful remarks and moral support during the development of jaxodraw .",
    "we also acknowledge prof .",
    "jos vermaseren for his kind permission to use and distribute his axodraw style file along with jaxodraw .",
    "+ work partially supported by the grant fpa-2002 - 00612 .",
    "* note * : it is not necessary to install axodraw in order to run jaxodraw",
    ". you will just not be able to use the latex / latex - eps export options but you may still generate direct postscript output of your feynman diagrams .",
    "beware however that in the current version , trying to run an internal latex  compilation without axodraw installed , will hang the program .",
    "see the bugs section  [ bugs ] .    in the current version of jaxodraw",
    "we distribute a copy of j. vermaseren s axodraw package ( with kind permission of the author ) in the distribution home directory .",
    "you have to install axodraw.sty such that latex  can find it on your system .",
    "this appendix describes how to do that .      or from the jaxodraw distribution home directory .",
    "please refer to the axodraw user guide for a detailed documentation of the package .",
    "we shall only outline here how you make axodraw available on your system and how you use it with the latex  output from jaxodraw .      for installation",
    ", you have two options : if you intend to use axodraw just for yourself on a multi - user platform , you may install it locally ; if you want to make it available for all the users on the system , you should do a global installation . note that you will need root privileges for a global installation .",
    "the easiest way to use axodraw is to put the axodraw.sty file in the same directory as your latex  source file ( like the one produced by jaxodraw via the export ` - > ` latex command ) .",
    "this is usually the same directory where you execute the program ( but note that you can not execute jaxodraw from a different directory in this case ) .",
    "you can then run latex on your source file as usual , the style file will be found because the current directory is by default in the texinputs search path .",
    "an alternative ( better ) way is to put the style file in a special directory ( this is particularly useful if you have several style files which are not part of your standard latex  distribution ) .",
    "let s say you put it into the directory latex/ in your home directory .",
    "you then have to set the texinputs variable to this path",
    ". if you are using bash , just do      ( the // : at the end tells latex  also to look into sub - directories of this path ) . if you want to make that permanent , you should put this line into your .bashrc file .",
    "you will then be able to start jaxodraw from any directory , independently of the location of axodraw.sty .",
    "installing axodraw system wide is very easy .",
    "just put the style file somewhere in the global search path of your latex  distribution ( on redhat linux typically /usr",
    "/ share / texmf / tex / latex / misc/ ) and update the tex  database with          under windows , you have to do basically the same as under linux .",
    "first put your axodraw.sty file into the miktex search tree ( somewhere under /texmf / tex / latex/ , replace the slash by a backslash ! ) and update your database with the command mktexlsr in the /texmf / tex / miktex / bin directory ."
