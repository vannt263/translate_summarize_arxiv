    "archimedes , whose 2300th birthday we celebrate this year , was a mathematician and inventor who pursued mechanical methods to develop a pure theory . in admiration for his mathematical discoveries , which were often fueled by experiment , we follow his steps by building models produced with modern 3d printers .",
    "archimedes was an early experimental mathematician @xcite who would use practical problems and experiments as a heuristic tool @xcite .",
    "he measured the center of mass and made comparisons between the volumes and surface areas of known and unknown objects by comparing their integrals , starting to build the initial ideas of calculus .",
    "he also tackled problems as a practical engineer , building winches , pumps , and catapults @xcite .",
    "+ in mathematics , archimedes is credited for the invention of the exhaustion method , a concept that allowed him to compute the area of a disc , parabola segments , the volume of a sphere , cones and other quadrics , objects bound by cylinders and planes , like the hoof , or objects obtained by the intersection of two or three cylinders , or more general solids that we call now archimedean spheres @xcite .",
    "archimedes method was an important step towards calculus ; his ideas would later be built upon by the italian school like cavalieri and torricelli , and by descartes and fermat in france .",
    "it would eventually be refined by leibniz and newton to become the calculus we know today @xcite .",
    "archimedes had a different approach to research than euclid . while appreciating euclid s format in communicating proof , he did not follow a deductive way but pursued mechanical methods to develop a pure theory .",
    "+ the life of archimedes also lead to a dramatic story in the history of mathematics @xcite : the event was the discovery of the  palimpsest \" , a byzantine manuscript from the 10th century that had been reused to copy a prayer book three centuries later .",
    "it remained hidden until the mid - nineteenth century @xcite when johannes heiberg @xcite , a philologist of greek mathematics , consulted it in istanbul .",
    "but only in the 21st century , with the help of modern computer technology , researchers finally were able to read the manuscript completely @xcite .",
    "this document revealed much about the thinking of archimedes and gave historians insights about how he discovered mathematical results .",
    "it contains  the method \" , of which the palimpsest contains the only known copy .",
    "+    we know the birth year 287 bc of archimedes more accurately than from other contemporary mathematicians because of a biography about archimedes written by heraclides @xcite .",
    "therefore , the year 2013 celebrates the 2300th birthday of archimedes .",
    "the death year is known because his city was sacked in 212 bc , an event during which archimedes was killed .",
    "we also know much about archimedes by the work of the historian john tzetzes @xcite .",
    "archimedes achievements are covered in all textbooks dealing with the history of early geometry .",
    "examples are @xcite . while some of the main ideas in calculus were pioneered during archimedes time , crucial ingredients like the concept of a function or a precise notion of limit were missing . calculus needed to wait 1500 years to be completed @xcite .",
    "modern revelations have shown that archimedes already seemed to have made an important step towards tacking the infinity in calculus @xcite . only newton and leibniz , after the concept of a  function \" was available , made calculus into the science we know today . despite having modern techniques available to compute , the method of archimedes can still be admired today and influenced other techniques in analysis .",
    "his thinking contained the germ for understanding what a limit is .",
    "the mechanical approach archimedes used to compute volumes consisted of a comparison method : cut a region or body into thin slices and then compare the area or volume of slices to different bodies of known area or volume .",
    "the method allowed him also to compute other integral quantities like the center of mass of bodies .",
    "+ in his work  on the sphere and the cylinder \" @xcite , archimedes rigorously derived the surface area and volume of the unit sphere .",
    "he noticed that the ratio of the surface area @xmath0 to that of its circumscribing cylinder is @xmath1 is * @xmath2 * and that the ratio the volume of the sphere @xmath3 with the volume of the circumscribing cylinder @xmath4 is * @xmath2 * also .",
    "he generalized this and also ",
    "archimedean domes \" or ",
    "archimedean globes \" have volume equal to * @xmath2 * of the prism in which they are inscribed .",
    "it was discovered only later that also for globes , the surface area is * @xmath2 * of the surface area of a circumscribing prism @xcite .",
    "+ as reported by plutarch @xcite , archimedes was so proud of his sphere computation that he asked to have it inscribed in his tombstone .",
    "heath concluded from this that archimedes regarded it as his greatest achievement .",
    "it was cicero who confirmed that  a sphere along with a cylinder had been set up on top of his grave \" @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the tombstone is lost .",
    "+ to cite @xcite : _  but for all of these accomplishments , his undisputed masterpiece was an extensive , two - volume work titled ` on the sphere and the cylinder ' . here with almost superhuman cleverness , he determined volumes and surface areas of spheres and related bodies , thereby achieving for three - dimensional solids what measurement of a circle had done for two - dimensional figures .",
    "it was a stunning triumph , one that archimedes himself seems to have regarded as the apex of his career . \"",
    "_ the work  on the sphere and the cylinder \" is considered an ideal continuation of euclid s elements @xcite . +",
    "the work of archimedes is now available in @xcite and in annotated form in @xcite .",
    "still , archimedes can be difficult to read for a modern mathematicians .",
    "lurje @xcite writes on page 176 : _ ",
    "archimedes is a very difficult author .",
    "he appears as such for us and must have so for ancient mathematicians .",
    "if plutarch lauds the clarity of the proofs of archimedes , then this only shows that plutarch did not understand mathematics , that he never read archimedes and only wanted to paint a picture of a genius . \" _ as it happens frequently for creative mathematicians , there could also be gaps like in proposition 9 of  on the sphere and the cylinder \" @xcite .",
    "but shortcomings are frequent in works of pioneers .",
    "there is no doubt that the mathematics of archimedes was astounding for the time . from @xcite : _  archimedes was doing mathematics whose brilliance would be unmatched for centuries ! not until the development of calculus in the latter years of the seventeenth century",
    "did people advance the understanding of volumes and surface areas of solids beyond its archimedean foundation .",
    "it is certain that , regardless of what future glories await the discipline of mathematics , no one will ever again be 2000 years ahead of his or her time . \" _",
    "also the practical work of archimedes is impressive . we dare to speculate that archimedes - the engineer - would have liked modern 3d - prototyping technology .",
    "it is conceivable that he would have considered using it as a tool for experimentation or illustration . instead of drawing winches , pulleys , or pumps and",
    "then build large scale models , he could prototype smaller versions first to test the device .",
    "+ heath writes @xcite :  incidentally he made himself famous by a variety of ingenious mechanical inventions .",
    "these things were however merely the ` diversions of geometry at play ' ( plutarch ) and he attached no importance to them . \" in @xcite page 130 , this statement is questioned . in al",
    "jallil - as - siisi from the 10th to 11th century for example , one does not find this ",
    "contemptuousness with respect to practical mechanics \" .",
    "lurie claims that plutarch obviously did not read the work of archimedes and cites tacquet , a geometer from the 17th century :  archimedes is more praised than read , more lauded than understood . \"",
    "the mechanical inventions include the cochlias or the archimedean screw , which is a machine to pump water , which he may have developed in his youth @xcite .",
    "according to diodorus , it has been used in egypt for the irrigation of fields or in spain in order to pump water out of mines . for the description we must rely on vitruvius @xcite .",
    "3d printing technology is a rapid prototyping process that allows the building of objects using various technologies .",
    "the industry is relatively young . only 30 years ago",
    ", the first patents of ballistic particle manufacturing were filed @xcite .",
    "jeremy rifkin @xcite considers the process part of the  third industrial revolution \" which he describes as a time when  manufacturing becomes digital , personal , and affordable . \"",
    "+ the first commercially successful 3d - printing technology appeared in 1994 with printed wax material .",
    "more recently , with the technology of deposition of acrylate photopolymers , the costs have dropped into a range of consumer technology . printing services now 3d print in color and high quality .",
    "3d printing belongs to a larger class of construction methods called rapid prototyping @xcite , which started in the 1980s and include a larger class of additive manufacturing processes .",
    "it is related to other technologies like automated fabrication or computer numerical controlled machining @xcite .",
    "the development of 3d printing belongs to an ongoing chain or evolution in industrialization and information .",
    "it is a trend created by different developments merging .",
    "production , information technology , communication , and transportation are all linked closer than ever @xcite .",
    "+    .information and industrial revolutions [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the attribute  additive \" in the description of 3d technology is used because the models are built by adding material . in sculpting or edging techniques by contrast , material is removed by chemical or mechanical methods .",
    "3d printing is more flexible than molding @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "the model is built from a series of layers , which ultimately form the cross sections of the object .",
    "other 3d technologies allow to add material also from more than one direction .",
    "+ in the last ten years , the technology has exploded and printers are now available for hobbyists . we have experimented with our own  up ! startplus \" printer which is small enough to be carried into a calculus classroom for demonstration .",
    "it allowed us for example to illustrate the concept of riemann integral by illustrating the layer - by - layer slicing of a solid .",
    "+ 3d printing is now heavily used in the medical industry ; the airplane industry ; to prototype robots , art , and jewelry ; nano structures ; bicycles ; ships ; circuits ; make copies of artworks ; or even to print houses or decorate chocolate cakes .",
    "last and not least , and this is the thesis project of the second author , it is now also more and more used in education . while many courses deal primarily with the technique and design for 3d printing , a thesis of the second author focus on its use in mathematics education @xcite .",
    "archimedes is credited for the first attempts to find the area and circumference of a circle .",
    "he uses an exhaustion argument using the constant @xmath5 defined as the circumference divided the diameter . to compute the area",
    ", he would compute the area of an inscribed regular polygon with contains the circle .",
    "each polygon is a union of @xmath6 congruent triangles whose union exhausts the disk more and more . to get an upper bound",
    ", he would look at polygons containing the circle .",
    "the value of the circumference of the circle is so sandwiched between the circumferences of the inner and outer polygon which converge .",
    "modern calculus shoots all this down with explicit  squeeze formulas \" for the circumference @xmath7 and area @xmath8 , which are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the calculus student of today sees that archimedes was essentially battling the limit @xmath11 for @xmath12 . that the limit is @xmath13 is sometimes called the  fundamental theorem of trigonometry \" because one can deduce from this fact - using addition formulas - the formulas the derivatives of the trig functions in general .",
    "we mention the modern point of view because it shows that archimedes worked at the core of calculus .",
    "he battled the notion of limit by comparing lower and upper bounds .",
    "the exhaustion argument also works for spheres , where it can be used that the volume @xmath14 and surface area @xmath8 of a sphere are related by @xmath15 .",
    "we illustrated this with a 3d model .",
    "archimedes idea of comparing areas of cross sections of two different bodies is today also called the * cavalieri principle * @xcite . in calculus classrooms ,",
    "it is related to the  washer method \" : if we slice a body @xmath16 perpendicularly along a line and if the area of a slice is @xmath17 and we use a coordinate system , where @xmath18 is the floor and @xmath19 the roof , @xmath20 is the volume of the solid . consequently , if two bodies can be sliced so that the area functions @xmath17 agree , then their volumes agree .",
    "archimedes understood the integral as a sum .",
    "indeed , the riemann sum with equal spacing @xmath21 is sometimes called * archimedes sum * @xcite . for a piecewise continuous cross - section area @xmath17 ,",
    "it is equivalent to the riemann sum .",
    "the cavalieri principle is a fundamental idea that perpetuates to other ideas of mathematics .",
    "+ of  archimedean style \" @xcite , for example , is the pappus centroid theorem , which determines the volume of a solid generated by rotating a two - dimensional region in the @xmath22 plane around the @xmath23 axes .",
    "rotating two regions of the same area around produces the same volume . a mechanical proof is given in @xcite .",
    "more general formulas can be obtained by taking a tubular neighborhood of a curve in space or a tubular neighborhood of a surface .",
    "the book @xcite has made it an important tool in differential geometry .",
    "+ greek mathematicians like archimedes knew that the volume of a tetrahedron is one third of the product of the area of the base times the height @xcite .",
    "one can see this by cutting a parallelepiped with twice the base area into six pieces . + this fact can be difficult to visualize on the blackboard .",
    "we used a 3d printer to produce pieces that add up to a cube .",
    "+    given a two - dimensional region @xmath16 in the @xmath24 plane and a point @xmath25 the convex hull defines a pyramid .",
    "the cross section at height @xmath23 has area @xmath26 .",
    "integrating this from @xmath27 to @xmath28 gives @xmath29 . to see this geometrically without calculus ,",
    "one can triangulate the region and connect each triangle @xmath30 to @xmath25 .",
    "this produces tetrahedra which each have volume @xmath31 .",
    "summing over all triangles gives the approximate area of the base and summing all the tetrahedron volumes leads to the volume of the cone .",
    "+    an impressive example of the comparison method is the computation of the volume of the sphere .",
    "archimedes used the same principle to compute the volume of archimedian globes or domes ( half globes ) @xcite .",
    "archimedes compared the volume of a sphere with the differences of a cylinder and a cone . for the sphere ,",
    "the area of a cross section is a disc of radius @xmath32 which leads to an area @xmath33 .",
    "this is also the area of the ring obtained by cutting the complement of a cone in a cylinder .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we printed a half - sphere bowl that drains into the complement of a cone in a cylinder ( see figure  [ sphereproof ] ) . to demonstrate the proof , we fill in the top with water and let it drain into the base .",
    "we can now drink the proof . a 3d model that illustrates this",
    "can be seen in figure  [ sphereproof ] . in the case of the archimedean dome ,",
    "the comparison is done with the complement of a polygonal pyramid inside a circumscribing prism verifies also here that the volume is @xmath2 of the prism . in the limit ,",
    "when the polygon approaches a circle , one gets again that the volume of the sphere is @xmath2 times the volume of the cylinder in which the sphere is inscribed .",
    "a classical problem asks for the volume of the intersection of two cylinders intersecting perpendicularly leading to a  himmelsgewlbe \" . also this object has been studied already by archimedes @xcite and is an example of an archimedean globe .",
    "the problem to compute its volume or the surface area appears in every calculus book .",
    "another problem is the intersection of three cylinders , an integration problem that is also abundant in calculus books .",
    "the first one is a solid which projects onto a square or two discs .",
    "the latter is a body which is not a sphere and projects on to three discs .",
    "+ another solid that fits into this category is the * archimedian hoof*. it is the solid bound by a cylinder and two planes .",
    "the hoof plays an important role in the understanding of archimedes thinking @xcite .",
    "the * archimedes hoof * @xcite is the solid between the planes @xmath34 and @xmath18 inside the cylinder @xmath35 .",
    "it appears in any calculus textbook as an application in polar integration @xmath36 which archimedes knew already to be @xmath37 of the volume @xmath38 of the cube of side length @xmath39 containing the hoof .",
    "archimedes figured out the volume differently .",
    "he noticed that the slices @xmath40 lead to triangles which are all similar and have area @xmath41 .",
    "integrating this up from @xmath42 to @xmath43 is the area under the parabola @xmath44 and @xmath18 , a result which archimedes already knew .",
    "the hoof actually might be the birth crib of infinitesimal calculus as we know it today .",
    "martin gardner mentions as part of nine problems in @xcite the question to find a volume of a body that fits snugly into a circle , square or triangle .",
    "gardner hints that the volume is easy to determine without calculus .",
    "+ indeed , this problem is in the archimedes style because the volume is half of the cylinder as can be seen that when slicing it in the direction where one sees the triangle : at every cross section the triangle has half the area of the rectangle . taking the rectangle instead of",
    "the triangle produces the cylinder of area @xmath5 .",
    "the cork therefore has volume @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we illustrate another theme of circles and spheres which archimedes would have liked but did not know .",
    "the steiner chain and its three dimensional versions illustrate a more sophisticated comparison method . applying a mbius transformation in the flat case",
    "leads to chains where the spheres have different radius .",
    "if one extends the circles to spheres , one obtains soddy s multiplets @xcite these are shapes that are interesting to plot .",
    "we illustrated in this project also that this technology can lead to new perspectives when looking at the history of mathematics and engineering .",
    "the new and still cutting - edge technology allows everybody to build models for the classroom .",
    "+ physical models are important for hands - on active learning .",
    "this has led to a repository of 3d printable models for education @xcite .",
    "+ the principles of integration appear in a natural way in 3d printing , where a three dimensional object is built up automatically , like layer by layer .",
    "printing objects has become a fancy activity as printers have become more affordable .",
    "one of us ( e.s . ) purchased a 3d printer to experiment with the technology to explore the technology for the classroom .",
    "there are also online services like  shapeways \" or  sculpteo \" that print an object and deliver it . using 3d printing technology in education is hardly new @xcite . it has even been considered for @xcite sustainable development in developing countries using sand in the desert .",

    "there is optimism that it will have a large impact in education @xcite . @xcite",
    "write :  as fabrication tools become increasingly accessible , students will be able to learn about engineering design and experience the thrill of seeing their ideas realized in physical form \" .",
    "we believe the same is true in mathematics .",

    "margaret s highschool is quoted as , ",
    "3d printing stimulates a student s mechanical - spatial awareness in ways that textbooks can not . \"",

    "one of us ( e.s . ) has taught part of a lecture at harvard using this technology .",
    "we have brought our printer into the classroom to illustrate the concept with single variable calculus students .",
    "+ it has also been used in a multivariable calculus courses at harvard as a final project .",
    "funding from the elson family arts initiative is currently being used to print the student projects .",
    "we conclude this article with some tips and remarks for anybody who wants to explore the subject more .",
    "first of all , the technology needs patience .",
    "do nt expect that things work immediately especially when printing on your own printer .",
    "you need a lot of time and ability to overcome obstacles .",
    "printer parts can fail , calibration can be subtle , software glitches occur frequently .",
    "commercially available printing services can refuse to print certain parts .",
    "it is still an area for enthusiasts .",
    "in addition , printers costing dozens of thousand dollars can break .",
    "we have seen this in local art shops or when submitting to professional printing services .",
    "it can happen for example that objects pass initial tests but can not be printed in the end .",
    "the sphere volume proof , for example , was rejected several times , even after multiple optimization attempts .",
    "another source for difficulties can be the size of the object , as it can affect the printing cost .",
    "+ during the time of this project , the prices have fallen and the printers have become easier to work with .",
    "this is good news for anybody who wants to experiment with mathematical shapes beyond pen , paper , and computers .",
    "+ the technology of 3d printing is exciting because it develops fast .",
    "the prices have dropped to as little as 500 dollars .",
    "some of the insights we gained when working with printing could be useful also in the future , when printers will be a standard in many households . here",
    "are few tips when dealing with 3d printing in education :    * to print more complicated objects or objects which have movable parts , add thin connections to be removed before use .",
    "an example is the archimedes cochlias which contains a spiral moving inside a cylinder .",
    "* most printers use millimeters for units , so it is best to design using a millimeter template .",
    "the same units work best for importing into a printing program or printing service .",
    "* it is important to check the tolerances of the printer and the materials before designing a shape .",
    "* walls can not be too thin .",
    "materials and printers require at least 1 mm thickness , and sometimes up to 3 mm , and this is another reason to design in millimeters and not inches . *",
    "connecting cylinders that provide stability can not be too narrow or they break . *",
    "hollow shapes are less expensive to print than solids . *",
    "solid parts need to be closed to print correctly . *",
