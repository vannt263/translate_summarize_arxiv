    "in modern condensed matter theory , an essential problem is the classification of phases of matter and the associated phase transitions . long range correlation and broken symmetry@xcite provide the conceptual foundation to the traditional theory of phases .",
    "the mathematical description of such a theory is realized very naturally in terms of order parameters and group theory .",
    "the landau symmetry breaking theory was so successful that people started to believe that the symmetry breaking theory described all phases and phase transitions . from this point of view",
    ", the discovery of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect@xcite in the 1980 s appears even more astonishing than what we realized .",
    "these unique phases of matter have taught us a very important lesson , when quantum effects dominate , entirely new kinds of order , orders not associated with any symmetry , are possible.@xcite similarly , new type of quantum phase transitions , such as the continuous phase transitions between states with the same symmetry@xcite and incompatible symmetries@xcite are possible .",
    "there is literally a whole new world of quantum phases and phase transitions waiting to be explored .",
    "the conventional approaches , such as symmetry breaking and order parameters , simply does not apply here .",
    "the particular kind of order present in the fractional quantum hall effect is known as topological order,@xcite or more specifically , chiral topological order because of broken parity and time reversal ( pt ) symmetry .",
    "topological phases which preserve parity and time reversal symmetry are also possible,@xcite and we will focus on these phases in this paper . an appealing physical picture has recently been proposed for this large class of pt symmetric topological phases in which the relevant degrees of freedom are string like objects called string - nets.@xcite just as particle condensation provides a physical picture for many symmetry breaking phases , the physics of highly fluctuation strings , string - net condensation , has been found to underlie pt symmetric topological phases .",
    "the physical picture of string - net condensation provides also a natural mathematical framework , tensor category theory , which can be used to write down fixed point wave functions and calculate topological quantum numbers.@xcite these topological quantum numbers include the ground state degeneracy on a torus , the statistics and braiding properties of quasi - particles , and topological entanglement entropy.@xcite all these physical properties are quite non - local , but they can be studied in a unified and elegant manner using the nonlocal string - net basis .    unfortunately , this stringy picture for the physics underlying the topological phase seems poorly suited for describing phase transitions out of the topological phase .",
    "the large and non - local string - net basis is difficult to deal with in the low energy continuum limit appropriate to a phase transition .",
    "trouble arises from our inability to do mean field theory , to capture the stringiness of the state in an average local way .",
    "indeed , the usual toolbox built around having local order parameters is no longer available since there is no broken symmetry .",
    "we are thus naturally led to look for a local description of topological phases which lack traditional order parameters .",
    "remarkably , there is already a promising candidate for such a local description .",
    "a new local ansatz , tensor product states ( also called projected entangled pair states ) , has recently been proposed for a large class of quantum states in dimensions greater than one @xcite . in the tensor product state ( tps )",
    "construction and its generalizations,@xcite the wave function is represented by a local network of tensors giving an efficient description of the state in terms of a small number of variables .",
    "the tps construction naturally generalizes the matrix product states in one dimension.@xcite the matrix product state formulation underlies the tremendous success of the density matrix renormalization group for one dimensional systems.@xcite the tps construction is useful for us because it allows one to locally represent the patterns of long - range quantum entanglement@xcite that lies at the heart of topological order . in this paper",
    ", we show that the general string - net condensed states constructed in have natural tps representations .",
    "thus the long - range quantum entanglement in a general ( non - chiral ) topologically ordered state can be captured by tps .",
    "the local tensors that characterize the topological order can be viewed as the analogue of the local order parameter describing symmetry breaking order .",
    "in addition to our basic construction , we demonstrate a set of invariance properties possessed by the tps representation of string - net states . these invariance properties are characteristic of fixed point states in a new renormalization group for quantum states called the tensor entanglement renormalization group.@xcite this fixed point property of string - net states has already been anticipated@xcite , and provides a concrete demonstration of string - net states as the infrared limit of pt symmetric topological phases .",
