    "the observational efforts devoted during the last years to measure the cosmic star formation history is clearly manifest in the growing number of works in the field . as a result of the advent of the hubble space telescope and of the 8 - 10 meter class telescopes , the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) star formation history per unit comoving volume initially derived up to @xmath9 1 @xcite was extended up to @xmath10 4 @xcite .",
    "naturally , all these works rely on the use of the available star formation rate ( sfr ) diagnostics : nebular emission lines like h@xmath2 @xcite and [ o  ii ] @xcite ; uv continuum luminosities @xcite ; far - infrared luminosities @xcite ; and 1.4  ghz radio luminosities @xcite .",
    "different cosmic star formation histories have been advocated from these various studies which can only be reconciled if the effect of dust extinction is accounted for .    in the local universe",
    ", galaxies radiate the bulk of their luminosity in the stellar regime , i.e. below @xmath11 5@xmath12 m . on average ,",
    "only about one third of their stellar light is absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the dust regime from the mid infrared ( mir ) to the sub - millimeter @xcite . in the distant universe",
    ", the reverse seems to take place as suggested by the combined results of the cosmic background experiment ( cobe ) , the isocam and isophot instruments on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the sub - millimeter camera scuba at the jcmt .",
    "number counts at 15@xmath12 m @xcite , at 90@xmath12 m and 170@xmath12 m @xcite , and at 450 and 850@xmath12 m ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) revealed the presence of an excess of faint galaxies by one order of magnitude in comparison with expectations based on the local properties of galaxies .",
    "such excess can only be explained if galaxies emitted a larger fraction of their luminosity in the dust regime in the past .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the detection of a strong cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) above @xmath13 100@xmath12 m @xcite the bulk of which appears to be produced by starbursting galaxies radiating the majority of their light in the ir above @xmath11 5@xmath12 m @xcite .",
    "two major questions remain unanswered :     how consistent are the different sfr indicators commonly used in the literature ?     do local and distant galaxies exhibit a similar behaviour ?",
    "studies of local galaxies have shown that even after correcting for dust extinction , a significant discrepancy remains between sfrs derived from uv and h@xmath2 measurements compared with those obtained from fir and radio luminosities , and that this discrepancy is worse for galaxies with higher sfrs @xcite . @xcite and @xcite report an increase of the @xmath14(h@xmath2)/@xmath14(h@xmath15 ) ratio , used to measure extinction , with the sfr of galaxies .",
    "they suggest to use the fit to this correlation in order to account for dust extinction when h@xmath15 is not available .",
    "however , @xcite indicate that the apparent link between extinction and star formation is likely not real , but only the result of a dispersed correlation between dust extinction and luminosity .    in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite studied a sample of 12 galaxies with @xmath16 , detected with isocam in the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) .",
    "they showed that the discrepancy found between optical - uv and fir - radio sfrs in the local universe is also present at high  @xmath17 .",
    "however , the balmer decrement was not available for these galaxies and the authors discussed the effect of dust extinction assuming an average correction factor of 4 for sfr(h@xmath2 ) .    in the present paper , we propose to address the two previous questions using a test sample of seven galaxies at @xmath18 0.4 and 0.8 , five of which have mir flux densities from which we derived fir luminosities assuming that the correlation between mir and fir luminosities observed in the local universe remains valid at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were selected from their mir flux density in order to sample sfrs in the range from 2 to 160m@xmath19 yr@xmath20 and morphologies ranging from a normal spiral to merging galaxies .    in this work",
    "we extend to higher redshifts the comparison between different sfr estimators that have been used for samples of local galaxies ( e.g. , sullivan et al .",
    "2001 ) . for that purpose",
    ", we compare classical sfr indicators such as the nebular emission lines [ o  ii ] and h@xmath2 , or the uv continuum , that we correct for dust extinction using the balmer decrement , with the fir and radio luminosities which are unaffected by extinction .",
    "this has been made possible with the comissioning of high resolution optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy on the keck telescopes .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy is required not only to avoid the contamination from atmospheric oh emission lines but also to resolve the [ n  ii]@xmath21    and h@xmath2 emission lines . after the presentation of the observational data in sect .",
    "[ data ] , the fluxes in these three lines will be combined in sect .",

    "unless otherwise indicated , throughout this paper we will assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the sample of dusty starburst galaxies was chosen according to the availability of isocam-15  @xmath12 m luminosities ( or , at least , upper limits ) for each object .",
    "the galaxies were also constrained to have a spectroscopic redshift accurate enough to insure that the h@xmath2 line would be free of contamination due to night sky lines . with those criteria in mind ,",
    "we have selected 4  galaxies with a mean redshift @xmath25 in the hubble deep field north , @xcite , and 3  galaxies with @xmath26 in the groth strip survey , gss @xcite .",
    "the whole set of galaxies is listed in table  [ table_sample ] and displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure_mosaic ] .",
    "interestingly , the two galaxies undetected by iso have a compact morphology ( hd2 - 264.2 and gss084_4515 ) .",
    "the iso sources are face - on spirals ( hd4 - 656.1 , hd4 - 795.111 , and gss084_4521 ) , a disky galaxy ( hd2 - 264.1 ) , and a colliding system ( gss073_1810 ) which looks like a higher redshift analogue of the local antenae system ( ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 ) . in order to facilitate the recognition of the individual objects in some of the figures of this paper ,",
    "we have labeled the symbols with the letters s , d , c and a , corresponding to their morphologies , i.e.  spiral , disky , compact and antenae - like , respectively .    according to their ir luminosities ( computed as described in sect .",
    "[ subsection_sfr_ir ] and listed in table  [ table_more_galaxy_properties ] ) , the hdf - n galaxies are not luminous enough to be classified as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirg , @xmath27 ) , whereas the contrary is true for the gss objects .",
    "note that although gss073_1810 could be marginally considered as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ; @xmath28 ) , this object is constituted by two colliding galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_mosaic ] ) . a more detailed characterization of the galaxy sample is presented in sects .  [ galaxy_properties ] and  [ description_individual_galaxies ] .    for all galaxies in our sample ,",
    "we have obtained optical and near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "the observations were carried out with the w.  m.  keck observatory telescopes and 3 different instruments over 5 observing runs ( see table  [ table_sample ] ) .",
    "for the relatively low redshift galaxies , we employed the echelle spectrograph and imager , esi @xcite , which covers the full wavelength range from 3900    to 11000    in one configuration , and with a spectral resolution @xmath29    at observed @xmath30   .",
    "however , for the more distant gss galaxies , initially only observed in the spectral range 45009000    with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer , lris @xcite ( @xmath31   ) , we expanded the spectral window by using the near - infrared echelle spectrograph nirspec @xcite in the j band ( n2 and n3 filters , total spectral range 1.089 - 1.375  @xmath32 , @xmath33   ) .",
    "in general the observations were carried out with airmasses ranging from 1.09 to 1.56 .",
    "the reduction of the lris data ( runs 1 , 2 and  3 ) is as described in @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux calibration used observations of the spectrophotometric standard ( runs  1 and  3 ) as the primary calibrator and the spectra of two stars , gss063_0445 and gss093_2453 ( runs 1 , 2 and  3 ) , used to align the image masks , as secondary calibrators .",
    "we find that the response curve of lris is very stable on a run - to - run basis , with small fluctuations @xmath34% , which translate into negligible variations in the star formation rates once other sources of error and uncertainties are considered .",
    "the esi ( run  4 ) and nirspec ( run  5 ) spectra have been reduced using a suite of our own programs based on the reduceme package @xcite , and a new fortran package , xnirspec , specially developed for the reduction of the near - ir data .",
    "error frames have been computed directly from the raw images , using the read - out noise and the gain of each detector .",
    "the reduction in parallel of these error frames together with the data images guarantees the correct propagation of errors due to arithmetic manipulation throughout the reduction procedure @xcite . in this sense , each fully processed spectrum is accompanied by an associated error spectrum which contains the random error in each pixel due to photon statistics and read - out noise .",
    "one of the major problems encountered when measuring spectral features in the near - ir is the proper removal of the oh emission lines @xcite and the compensation for telluric absorption due to water vapour and other molecules @xcite .",
    "systematic variations in the spectral direction ( e.g.sampling aliasing , inacurate geometric distortion corrections ) , and in flux calibration ( e.g.  even small flatfield biases , residual fringing , or slit width inhomogeneities ) , pose a difficult challenge to the data reduction . trying to minimize part of these problems , the nirspec observations were carried out nodding the telescope , changing the position of the galaxies on the slit , in order to feed the data reduction pipeline with the subtraction of consecutive images . even when following this procedure , the unpredictable residuals of each sky line ( either in intensity or sign ) had to be subtracted like normal sky lines in a subsequent step .",
    "since the spectra obtained in the detector plane of esi and nirspec are distorted , the image rectification prior to the removal of sky lines generates aliasing artifacts ( the undersampled sky line residuals can not be properly rectified ) , and , in addition , introduces a correlation between adjacent pixels in the error frames . in order to alleviate both effects , we mapped the image distortions in the spatial and spectral directions by using bivariate polynomial transformations @xcite .",
    "these mapping functions were determined by fitting the spectrum of a bright star , observed at different positions along the slit , and to the sky lines .    for the esi observations , the removal of the telluric absorption , as well as the absolute flux calibration , used the high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n per @xmath35 ) almost featureless spectra of the spectrophotometric stars ( , wolf  1346 and feige  34 ) . in the nirspec",
    "run only one spectrophotometric star was observed ( ) , and the removal of telluric features was performed using the observation of v986  oph , a hot ( b0iii ) and bright ( @xmath36  mag ) star .    all the flux calibrated spectra are displayed in figs .",
    "[ figure_sp_hdfn ] and  [ figure_sp_gss ] .",
    "the spectra have been corrected for atmospheric extinction using the mauna kea values available on the www page of the ukirt ( united kingdom infrared telescope ) .",
    "the small corrections for galactic extinction used the dust maps of @xcite and the galactic extinction curve of @xcite .    with the aim of correcting the measured balmer emission line fluxes for the expected underlying stellar absorption",
    ", we have applied the criterion followed by @xcite , who , based on the extensive analysis of giant extragalactic hii regions by @xcite , employed @xmath37    for galaxies with undetected or uncertain h@xmath38 flux .    in order to follow a homogeneous procedure in the determination of line luminosities , line fluxes",
    "have been derived from gaussian fits to the corresponding emission lines .",
    "it is worth noting that these fits not only match the observed spectra within the error bars available in each pixel , but they also help minimizing the uncertainties due to the choice of integration limits on both sides of the emission lines .",
    "flux errors are also easily computed in this way through numerical simulations with bootstrapped error spectra .",
    "all the measured emission lines are displayed in the insets of figs .",
    "[ figure_sp_hdfn ] and  [ figure_sp_gss ] ( see caption for details ) .",
    "their values are listed in table  [ table_fluxes ] .",
    "considering that the h@xmath2 line has been observed in spectral regions densely populated by sky lines , it is not surprising that in some cases large residuals prevented fitting gaussians to the entire wavelength domain of the [ n  ii ] @xmath396549 , 6583 lines . in these cases",
    "( and also when no clear signature of these lines was detectable ) , since the expected location of the lines is very well constrained by the centroid of the h@xmath2 line , restricted fits were performed to the line regions free of contamination ( see caption of table  [ table_fluxes ] for details ) .",
    "restricted fits have also been applied to other emission lines when required .",
    "intrinsic reddenings , parameterized through the color excess in the nebular gas , e(b@xmath40v)@xmath41 , were determined using the measured balmer decrement , and assuming typical gas conditions , i.e.  @xmath42  @xmath43 , @xmath44  k , recombination case  b , and the flux ratio h@xmath2/h@xmath15=2.86 @xcite . since the extinction properties of the milky way @xcite , the small magellanic cloud @xcite , and the large magellanic cloud @xcite are similar in the optical and in the near - ir spectral ranges , it is common to assume that the selective extinction curve from any of these objects can be safely used to correct the emission lines for internal reddening @xcite .",
    "for this reason , here we adopt the average curve for galactic extinction published by @xcite .",
    "the e(b@xmath40v)@xmath41 values for our galaxy sample are given in the last column of table  [ table_fluxes ] .",
    "the quoted errors correspond to the propagation of random errors in the h@xmath2 and h@xmath15 fluxes .    finally ,",
    "to estimate the impact of the slit widths and position angles in the measured emission line fluxes , we computed the fraction of light passing through the slit for each observation , using the hst images ; these fractions and associated errors , are listed in table  [ table_aperture_corrections ] .",
    "the errors were calculated using numerical simulations which assume random positioning errors when placing the slits over the targets .",
    "the simulations were performed after isolating each galaxy from its neighbors using sextractor @xcite , with the configuration parameter checkimage_type set to objects .",
    "although those slit - loss estimates must be taken with caution , it seems unlikely that we are losing more than 50% of the light in any case .",
    "additional photometric data , shown in tables  [ table_more_fluxes_hdfn ] , [ table_more_fluxes_gss ] , and  [ table_more_fluxes_mir_radio ] , were used as consistency checks on the absolute flux calibration over the entire wavelength range .",
    "these data were also used to estimate the importance of the aperture correction when measuring the emission line fluxes ( see figs .",
    "[ figure_sp_hdfn ] and  [ figure_sp_gss ] ) , and to derive sfrs based on ultraviolet , infrared and radio luminosities .",
    "the hst magnitudes for the galaxies ( table  [ table_more_fluxes_hdfn ] ) correspond to the fluxes published by @xcite .    for the gss galaxies ( table  [ table_more_fluxes_gss ] ) we list the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 band magnitudes determined by @xcite using photometric data obtained with the prime focus ccd ( pfccd ) camera on the mayall 4  m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "in addition , we have computed @xmath49 and @xmath50  band magnitudes using sextractor @xcite applied on the hst images @xcite .",
    "we have also compared the kpno magnitudes with their analogous hst measurements . in this sense , a small offset of 0.15  mag has been detected between the kpno @xmath48 band magnitudes and the hst @xmath50 data ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_plot_brunner ] ) .",
    "we do not make a similar correction for the kpno @xmath47 band magnitudes because the overlap in wavelength with the @xmath51 bandpass is small and the comparison between both magnitudes has a large scatter .",
    "finally , we also derived a direct measurement of the @xmath52 band magnitude for the pair of interacting galaxies gss073_1810 . in this case , we made use of the images obtained with the slit - viewing camera scam of nirspec through the n3 filter ( covering the range 1.143 - 1.375 microns ) .",
    "although the total effective exposure time only lasted 80 seconds , it was enough to get the absolute flux with a relative random uncertainty of @xmath53% .",
    "the mir flux densities ( table  [ table_more_fluxes_mir_radio ] ) , @xmath54 , are the isocam measurements with the lw3 filter published by @xcite and @xcite for the and the gss galaxies , respectively .",
    "non - detections are indicated by an upper limit , that corresponds to the sensitivity threshold of the surveys .",
    "the flux published by @xcite for hd2 - 264.1 integrates the emission of four blended sources .",
    "the flux value given here is the result for only this galaxy , obtained after deconvolving the different objects ( h.  aussel 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "the fluxes for gss073_1810 and gss084_4521 are also revised values ( after improving the flux calibration through monte carlo simulations ; h.flores 2001 , private communication ) .    the radio flux densities ( last column in table  [ table_more_fluxes_mir_radio ] ) , @xmath55 ,",
    "are the 8.5  ghz measurements from @xcite for the galaxies , and the 5.0  ghz data from @xcite for the gss objects .",
    "we also quote the sensitivity limit of the considered survey for the undetected galaxies . finally , to be consistent with the estimation of the mir flux for hd2 - 264.1 , we consider that the radio flux in this case also integrates the combined values of the blended sources .",
    "thus , the quoted radio flux is the same fraction of the total radio flux .",
    "before calculating the sfrs from the collected multiwavelength data , we must consider the possible contamination of our galaxy sample by agns .",
    "the fact that qsos and ulirgs exhibit similar total luminosities and space densities led @xcite to suggest that ulirgs may constitute the dust - enshrouded phase of qso formation . in this sense , strong interactions and mergers are the mechanisms responsible for the funneling of gas into the central regions of galaxies , which subsequently may feed both star formation and agn activity .",
    "although some aspects of this scenario are still controversial , observations confirm the connexion between qso , ulirgs and mergers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in conclusion , rather than segregating lirgs and ulirgs into starbursts and agns",
    ", the key question is to constrain the relative contribution of each component to the ir luminosity in a case by case basis .      an important constraint on the contribution of agn radiation , if any , to the total luminosity of our galaxies comes from the use of emission - line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the set of emission lines displayed in table  [ table_fluxes ] allows us to examine two of the most commonly employed diagrams . in fig .",
    "[ plot_el ] we compare the ratio [ o  iii]@xmath65007/h@xmath15 ( which is an indicator of the gas excitation ) versus the ratios [ n  ii]@xmath66583/h@xmath2 and [ s  ii]@xmath396716,6731/h@xmath2 ( the tabulated line ratios are also given in table  [ table_emission_line_ratios ] ) .",
    "two interesting properties of these diagrams are their ability to properly discriminate between mechanisms responsible for the gas ionization ( star formation , agn , or shocks ) , and their low sensitivity to extinction corrections .",
    "the latter is clearly manifest in our data , since the mean correction of the plotted ratios in our galaxy sample is only 2% , with a maximum of 7% for the [ o  iii]@xmath65007/h@xmath15 ratio in hd2 - 264.2 . in panels  [ plot_el](a ) and",
    "[ plot_el](b ) we display a large collection of emission line ratios corresponding to nearby galaxies from @xcite and @xcite see table caption for details , whereas in panels  [ plot_el](c ) and  [ plot_el](d ) we do the same with our galaxy sample .",
    "the analysis of this figure clearly indicates that the locus spanned by our galaxies is perfectly compatible with that exhibited by star forming galaxies .",
    "it is also very interesting to compare the measured line fluxes exhibited by our galaxy sample , and in particular the ratios [ o  iii]@xmath65007/h@xmath15 ( an indicator of the emitting gas excitation ) , with those of local star - forming galaxies , as a function of luminosity .",
    "for this purpose , we have estimated rest - frame absolute blue magnitudes for each galaxy using the available hst @xmath51 and @xmath56 magnitudes ( note that the hst f606w and f814w bandpasses correspond approximately to the rest - frame @xmath46  band at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are precisely quite close to the redshifts exhibited by the present sample ) .",
    "the hst fluxes were corrected for redshift , the transmission curves of filters f606w and f814w were de - redshifted to reproduce pseudo @xmath46 bands for each target , and a residual k - correction ( ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60  mag ) was derived for each object , using the averaged spectral energy distributions corresponding to sab , sbc and scd galaxies of @xcite .",

    "there is a growing body of evidence indicating that the population of ir luminous galaxies detected by the isocam deep surveys are generally dust - obscured starbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report the presence of a dichotomy in the spectroscopic properties of starbursts and galaxies whose luminosity is dominated by gravitational accretion : the former show stronger mir broad emission features , with a fast decline in their emission shortward of , whereas agns are characterized by a flatter spectrum . through the analysis of these features , @xcite showed that agn activity is dominant in local ulirgs only for very luminous objects .",
    "in particular , these authors found that the contribution due to star formation to the total far - infrared luminosity is , on average , 82%94% for galaxies with @xmath64 ( for a cosmology with @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) , these numbers decrease to 44%55% at higher luminosities .",
    "considering that all our galaxies are below that threshold ( see table  [ table_more_galaxy_properties ] ) our data support the idea that star formation is the dominant source of ionization in our sample ( note that the largest @xmath8 value of @xmath67 10@xmath68 l@xmath19 corresponds to gss073_1810 , which actually consists of two interacting galaxies ) .",
    "since accretion around black holes must lead to the formation of luminous x - ray sources , specially in the hard x - ray domain ( less sensitive to extinction affecting obscured agns ) , the cross - correlation of deep x - ray and mir observations is a direct way to check for the mechanism responsible for the nebular emission - lines . from the deep x - ray survey in the hdf - n performed with chandra @xcite",

    "although we are not going to repeat all the details here , it is important to stress that the latter result alone clearly suggests that , in spite of its x - ray detection , a dominant agn contribution in this object can be safely dismissed .",
    "further support to the idea that the optical light of the galaxies under study is dominanted by hot stars is given by the lris spectra of the gss subsample .",

    "however , it is important to highlight that this common morphology is misleading , since , as we have previously discussed , these galaxies exhibit different metallicity , mass and structural properties , apart from a difference of a factor of @xmath160 in total far - infrared luminosity .",
    "the arrow in hd2 - 264.2 places this object close to sfr@xmath3/h@xmath161 , whereas in the case of the lcg gss084_4515 its real @xmath8 would put it either on the fit given by eq .",
    "( [ sfrratio_lir ] ) , or in the locus of the @xmath0 objects .",
    "if , as suggested by @xcite , lcgs are evolved starbursts and the progenitors of the present - day spiral bulges , objects of this type may have an important contribution to the sfr density at intermediate redshifts .",
    "these authors have also predicted the total far - infrared luminosities of lcgs to be around @xmath162  l@xmath62 , near or slightly below the limiting sensitivity reached by iso in the redshift range @xmath163 .",
    "if we assume that gss084_4515 belongs to the same galaxy family , and although its non - detection by iso is then not surprising , this galaxy will accommodate in the fit of eq .",
    "( [ sfrratio_lir ] ) .",
    "this result highlights the relevance of quantifying the actual @xmath8 of lcgs , which will be possible in a near future with the help of sirtf .",
    "another important question is whether it is possible to use any measurable parameter exclusively derived from the optical lines with the aim of correcting the biased sfr@xmath89 estimates , in order to match the values obtained from the total far - infrared luminosity . in this sense , and as we already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ introduction ] , @xcite and @xcite have recently reported a correlation between the optical extinction ( derived from the balmer decrement ) and the star formation rate ( or luminosity ) of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite also find correlations between the measured extinction in h@xmath2 , a[h@xmath2 ] , and @xmath8 , although with a very large scatter .",
    "we have represented in fig .",
    "[ figure_sfr_amag ] the ratio sfr@xmath143/sfr@xmath89 as a function of a[h@xmath2 ] . for local galaxies",
    "this ratio correlates with a[h@xmath2 ] when h@xmath2 fluxes uncorrected for extinction are used . after correcting the h@xmath2 flux for extinction , local galaxies and our galaxy subsample at @xmath0 scatter around sfr@xmath143/sfr@xmath164 , whereas the @xmath1 objects remain above this value .",
    "since the measured h@xmath2 extinctions in gss073_1810 and in gss084_4521 are very similar , we can not use this parameter to conclude whether there is any correlation between the systematic underestimation of sfr from h@xmath2 as a function of a[h@xmath2 ] .",
    "anyway , we should note that these two galaxies have h@xmath2 extinctions similar to hd2 - 264.1 , and lower than hd2 - 264.2 .",
    "both hd2 - 264.1 and hd2 - 264.2 have total far - infrared luminosities one order of magnitude fainter that either gss073_1810 and gss084_4515 .",
    "for that reason , if there were actually a correlation between the observed rest - frame optical extinction and the ratio sfr@xmath3/h@xmath2 , it should be sought in galaxies with @xmath165  l@xmath62 and , presumably , at intermediate redshifts .",
    "clearly more data are required in order to settle this question .",
    "in this work we have compared several star formation rate estimators using a small but diverse sample of galaxies at two intermediate redshifts ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . by selecting the sample galaxies on the basis of their isocam-15  @xmath12 m mid - infrared luminosities , we have sampled sfrs ranging from 2 to 160  m@xmath166 .",
    "their morphological types include spiral , compact and merging emission - line galaxies .",
    "it is important to highlight that the redshift segregation of the sample is also accompanied by a segregation in total far - infrared luminosity , with the farthest galaxies being the most luminous .",
    "this fact leads to an ambiguity between luminosity and distance that must be kept in mind when interpreting the results .",
    "the observed spectral range includes the most prominent optical emission lines , from [ o  ii]@xmath63727 to [ s  ii]@xmath396716,6731 .",
    "the availability of h@xmath15 and h@xmath2 allows the determination of color excesses in the nebular gas and correcting the emission - line fluxes for extinction .",
    "the diagnostic diagrams generated from the corrected emission - line ratios confirm the star - forming nature of the galaxies , as it was already suggested by evidence from their total far - infrared luminosity , observations in the x - ray domain , and the absence of broad emission lines .",
    "in addition , the overall characteristics of the selected galaxies , in particular their metallicity and structural properties , also match those of star forming galaxies , both local and at intermediate redshifts .    the good agreement between hst and ground - based photometry , in one hand , and the spectrophotometric calibration of the spectra , on the other , allows us to be confident on the reliability of the estimated aperture corrections , the final optical emission - line luminosities , and thus the sfrs from them obtained .",
    "our results have shown the following .",
    "\\(i ) there is a general good agreement in the comparison between the five available sfr indicators ( from uv , [ o  ii ] , h@xmath2 , ir and radio luminosities ) for the @xmath0 ( l@xmath167  l@xmath62 ) galaxies , whereas the situation is not the same in the case of the @xmath1 ( l@xmath168  l@xmath62 ) subsample , being the discrepancies different depending on the considered sfr estimator .",
    "focusing in the @xmath1 galaxies , the sfrs derived from uv , [ o  ii ] and ir luminosities are , respectively , lower , similar and higher , than the values obtained from h@xmath2 .",
    "the paradoxical behavior of sfr@xmath150 versus sfr@xmath157 is still subject of debate , and among the possible explanations for the observed discrepancies are temporal variations in the star formation history and luminosity dependent attenuations of the uv emission . from the observational perspective , we confirm the findings of @xcite and extend their result up to @xmath1 .",
    "\\(ii ) the correction for metallicity of the [ o  ii]/h@xmath2 ratio ( using the relation found in local galaxies ) greatly improves the concordance between the sfrs derived from the extinction corrected luminosities of both emission lines .",
    "the correction does in fact work for the galaxies in our sample in the two redshift ( or luminosity ) bins .",
    "\\(iii ) the fit given in eq .",
    "( [ sfrratio_lir ] ) , and shown in fig .  [ figure_psfr ] , indicates that _ extinction corrected _",
    "sfr@xmath157 estimates in luminous infrared galaxies at intermediate redshifts miss an increasing fraction of the total sfr , and that the degree of underestimation increases with @xmath8 .",
    "this result confirms the finding by @xcite who used an averaged extinction correction of @xmath169 derived from @xmath170 colors . in this work",
    "we quantify more rigorously this effect by employing line fluxes corrected for extinction making use of color excesses computed from the balmer decrement .",
    "thus , there is here an observational evidence that the balmer emission lines , h@xmath2 and h@xmath15 , do not probe the same region of a galaxy than the one which is responsible for the strong ir luminosity in the case of luminous ir galaxies .",
    "this is even more remarquable in fig .",
    "[ figure_sfr_amag ] where galaxies with very different sfrs share the same a[h@xmath2 ] .",
    "the spatial resolution in the mir is not sufficient to confirm this statement at these redshifts , but the case of the antennae galaxy ngc  4038/4039 @xcite offers a perfect example of such behavior in the local universe .",
    "a possible explanation for this effect is that a fraction of the star formation in these galaxies is embedded in dense and opaque dust clouds and that this fraction increases with the total star formation .",
    "as already expected , galaxy encounters ( hd2 - 264.1 and hd2 - 264.2 ) and mergers ( gss073_1810 ) are the likely causes for triggering star formation episodes .",
    "whether a quantitative estimation of the hidden star formation is definitely inaccessible to rest - frame optical spectroscopic studies , and in particular to the use of the measured h@xmath2 extinction , seems unclear , and deserves further research work .",
    "some kind of evolution in galaxies with @xmath159  l@xmath62 at @xmath171 can not be discarded , since , as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_psfr ] , an important fraction of local galaxies with those luminosities does not show such a large underestimation of the sfr when using h@xmath2 fluxes instead of far - infrared luminosities .",
    "however the scarcity of the galaxy samples strongly demands additional observational work in order to settle this point .    the inclusion of two apparently compact galaxies in our sample has allowed us to analyze the relation between the different sfr estimators applied to this kind of object relative to what is measured for spiral - like galaxies .",
    "in particular , one of these two objects qualifies as a luminous compact galaxy , with similar properties to those of the lcgs at intermediate redshifts studied by @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this object may be suffering similar dust - enshrouded star formation processes as galaxies with a very different morphological aspect , like the bona fide spiral gss084_4521 or even the antenae - like colliding system gss073_1810 .",
    "the confirmation of this still speculative result , which has important implications concerning the accurate estimation of the cosmic sfr density at intermediate redshifts , will be possible after the launch of sirtf .",
