    "experimental generation and characterization of entanglement on a macroscopic , or mesoscopic scales seem to be one of the necessary prerequisites of scalable quantum information processing .",
    "a spectacular progress has been achieved recently in the area of quantum correlated systems of atoms , and in particular _",
    "macroscopic atomic ensembles _ @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these studies is to achieve an efficient quantum interface between light and atoms with spin , or pseudo - spin internal states , using the generalized quantum faraday effect .",
    "such settings already allowed one to demonstrate entanglement of distant atomic objects @xcite , or deterministic memory for light @xcite that can be retrieved using quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "entanglement between light and atoms , and between atoms themselves plays , of course , essential role in these experiments .",
    "it worth stressing that the light - atoms interface based on using the quantum faraday effect does not only allow one to measure and detect atomic states .",
    "it does also provide a tool for manipulations and engineering of quantum fluctuations of atomic spins .",
    "the latter possibility might be of fundamental importance for the future implementations of distributed quantum information processing . in particular , the methods of atomic ensembles can be carried over to another rapidly developing area of ultracold atomic gases . here",
    ", the interest would be to measure characterize , and finally engineer quantum fluctuations of the total atomic spin in spinor ultracold gases ( for a review see @xcite ) that has been intensively studies since the seminal theory papers of t .-",
    "ho @xcite and t. ohmi and k. machida @xcite , as well as the experiments performed by the mit group on optically trapped sodium bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite . particularly interesting",
    "are prospects of applications of these methods to strongly correlated states of spin ultracold gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "yet another rapidly developing related area is that of quantum information processing with trapped ions .",
    "after the first works , in which the 3- and 4-ion @xmath4-state @xcite , and 3-ion @xmath1- and @xmath4-state @xcite have been generated @xcite , in recent experiments the tomography of 6- , 7- , and 8-ion @xmath1-states has been performed @xcite , and the 6-ion @xmath4-state has been generated @xcite .",
    "the problem of characterization of the generated forms of multipartite entanglement @xcite , or more generally , of characterization of many - body quantum correlations is thus of essential importance for the investigations of such mesoscopic systems .",
    "one of the possible ways to achieve it , is to measure the total spin ( or pseudo - spin ) of atoms ( or ions ) and its quantum fluctuations , which is , of course , possible by performing state tomography .",
    "the central role in this approach , applied to atomic ensembles , has been played so far by the , so called , spin squeezing parameter @xmath5 , introduced by m. kitagawa and m. ueda in ref . @xcite . as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite it provides a sufficient entanglement criterion for atomic ensembles . on top of that , @xmath5 is particularly appreciated by experimentalists since : i ) it has a clear physical meaning , ii ) it can be relatively easy measured , iii ) it is defined by a simple operational expression , iv ) it provides a figure of merit for atomic clocks .",
    "however , until our recent letter @xcite no further investigations to relate @xmath5 to other concepts of quantum information have been carried out .    the present work is a substantially extended version of ref .",
    "apart from the expanded theoretical analysis , we present here a detailed description of the ion - trap experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which output we apply our inequalities .",
    "let us first recall that in ref .",
    "@xcite we have generalized and connected the concept of spin squeezing parameters to the theory of entanglement witnesses @xcite , i. e. such observables @xmath6 that have non - negative averages for all separable states and there exists an entangled state @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . in order to derive the generalized spin squeezing inequalities ,",
    "we have proposed a general method of expressing state averages of the appropriate entanglement witnesses in terms of the macroscopic spin operators : @xmath9 ( we work in the units @xmath10 ) . here by @xmath11 we denote pauli matrices , indices @xmath12 enumerate the particles of the ensemble , and @xmath13 ( hat over the index denotes that it is omitted ) .",
    "it is worth recalling at this place that in the standard terminology @xcite a state of a spin-@xmath14 system is called spin squeezed if there exists a direction @xmath15 , orthogonal to the mean spin @xmath16 , such that : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "our method works as follows : we begin with considering symmetric states of @xmath0 qubits first , i.e. states @xmath7 that satisfy : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an orthogonal projector onto the symmetrized product of individual qubit spaces @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes symmetrization ) .",
    "it is known that for symmetric states of two and three qubits the necessary and sufficient condition for separability of a quantum state is equivalent to the positivity of partial transpose ( ppt ) of the state . for two qubits",
    "the ppt condition is in fact the necessary and sufficient condition for separability of arbitrary ( also non - symmetric ) states @xcite ; for symmetric states of three qubits this result has been shown in ref .",
    "the knowledge of the necessary and sufficient separability criterion allows us to derive the complete families of generalized spin squeezing inequalities , which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for genuine 2- , or 3- qubit entanglement for symmetric states .    our inequalities at the same time",
    "provide a sufficient condition for entanglement of general , i.e. not necessarily symmetric , states of @xmath0 qubits @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite imply also that , if we somewhat broaden the standard notion of spin squeezing ( [ xi ] ) , then for spin-@xmath14 systems represented as a collection of @xmath23 qubits , spin squeezing becomes equivalent to the bipartite entanglement among the qubits ( see also @xcite where the implication in one direction was obtained ) .",
    "we also derive and discuss improved w.r.t .",
    "@xcite versions of somewhat simpler spin squeezing inequalities that provide sufficient conditions for genuine 3-qubit entanglement .    to prepare the necessary data for the analysis of the output of the experiment from ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as to show how to obtain our inequalities for concrete purposes , we present in this paper a very explicit derivation of the inequalities for the , so called , dicke states @xcite , sometimes also called generalized @xmath1-states .",
    "we show step - by - step how to derive the inequalities probing genuine @xmath24- and @xmath25-qubit entanglement of this states .",
    "we also calculate all the necessary data data for checking @xmath2- and @xmath3-qubit @xmath1 states , which are of particular interest for us .    in the part of our work dedicated to the experiment",
    ", we present a detailed description and analysis of the experimental production and state tomography of 6- , 7- , and 8-particle @xmath1-states of trapped ions , first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we describe the details of the production of the states in an ion trap , dedicated to quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we explain the step - by - step generation algorithm , that was implemented in the experiment .",
    "we then explain how the state tomography was performed , and show the full reconstructed density matrix of the @xmath2-qubit @xmath1-state .",
    "we analyze the experimental imperfections as well .",
    "finally , we apply our spin squeezing inequalities to the experimental data to confirm the presence of 2- and 3-qubit entanglement in the generated states .",
    "let us stress that all of the proposed novel inequalities , analogously as the previously known squeezing parameter , i ) have a clear physical meaning in terms of generalized squeezing and entanglement conditions , ii ) can be relatively easy measured , and iii ) are given by complex , but _ elementary _ expressions .",
    "although in this paper we apply our theoretical tools to a fully restored density matrix from ref .",
    "@xcite , it is very important to understand that these tools require measurements of low order moments of the total spin fluctuations only .",
    "hence , checking of our inequalities can be relatively directly performed in large systems , such as atomic ensembles , where , in general , quantum tomography is not feasible .",
    "we also note that recently g.  tth has also derived various types of entanglement criteria based on entanglement witnesses and on the uncertainty of collective observables , such as the total spin or energy @xcite .",
    "these criteria are useful to detect the , so - called , cluster states and many body singlet states , but they may also be used to detect the dicke states discussed in this paper . the work is organized as follows : in sections ii and iii we revise the derivation of 2- and 3-qubit entanglement criteria .",
    "we give there some calculational details as well as correct versions of the formulas ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) from ref .",
    "these results are very general and apply to any system of qubits in any state : from few ions , through atomic ensembles to ultracold spinor gases . in section",
    "iv we specify our inequalities to a concrete example of experimentally accessible dicke states , and show how to construct our criteria in this case . in particular , we provide here explicit data for the case of 7- and 8-qubit @xmath1-states , preparing the input data for the analysis of the experiment of ref .",
    "section v is devoted to a detailed description of this experiment .",
    "we apply here our inequalities to the analysis of the output of this experiment , confirming the presence of 2- and 3-qubit entanglement .",
    "section vi is dedicated to the construction of simplified witnesses detecting genuine 3-qubit entanglement , improving the similar witnesses we constructed earlier in ref .",
    "the simplified witnesses , unfortunately , are not very useful for @xmath1-states , since they detect entanglement only for low number of qubits .",
    "that is why we do not use them for analysis of the experimental data of ref .",
    "we summarize our results in section vii .",
    "in this section we present a detailed derivation of generalized squeezing inequalities that detect 2-qubit entanglement . the aim is to use the quantum fluctuations of the total spin , whose low moments can be relatively easily measured , as an indicator of entanglement .",
    "the results obtained in this section , as well as the method itself , have a very general character , and can be used for arbitrary systems of qubits in any quantum state .",
    "let us recall that a multiqubit state @xmath7 possesses 2-qubit entanglement if for some qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 the reduced density matrix : @xmath28 is entangled .",
    "the ppt criterion @xcite implies that @xmath29 is entangled iff there exists a vector @xmath30 such that : @xmath31 where transpose is defined with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the standard basis @xmath32 .",
    "as @xmath33 we can take any eigenvector of @xmath34 corresponding to a negative eigenvalue .    according to our general strategy we first consider symmetric states , as then we can obtain a convenient parametrization of @xmath30 . in the 2-qubit case we can take advantage of the low dimensionality and use the explicit form of @xmath34",
    "let us first fix the basis of each qubit space by @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "then we have that : @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to check that vectors of the type : @xmath39 are preserved by @xmath40 , and , since they have three independent parameters ( we take them to be normalized , although it is not important for the condition ( [ ppt ] ) ) , it is possible to find a solution of the eigenvalue equation .",
    "hence , the negative eigenvalue vector in the inequality ( [ ppt ] ) must be of this form . from eq .",
    "( [ type ] ) it follows that the matrix @xmath41 $ ] of coefficients of @xmath30 is hermitian : @xmath42=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\eta & \\beta\\\\                                   \\beta^ * & \\gamma \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] and hence we can diagonalize it by some @xmath43 ( modulo @xmath44 phase rotation ) : @xmath45=\\tilde{u}^\\dagger\\delta\\tilde{u}.\\ ] ] note that due to the normalization of @xmath46 , the eigenvalue matrix @xmath47 can be put in the following form : @xmath48 , \\quad -\\pi\\le \\varphi \\le \\pi.\\ ] ] rewriting eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) explicitly in the basis , and using eq .",
    "( [ eigenval ] ) , we finally obtain the following parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and we have fixed the overall phase .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 from the decomposition ( [ type ] ) are now encoded into @xmath52 and @xmath53 . using the above parametrization inequality ( [ ppt ] ) takes the following form : @xmath54    in order to rewrite the condition ( [ ppt2 ] ) with the total spin operators ( [ s ] ) , we first recall that @xmath55 can be decomposed into pauli matrices , as it was done in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , the adjoint action of @xmath56 in the inequality ( [ ppt2 ] ) induces a @xmath57 rotation @xmath58 of the pauli matrices : @xmath59 ( here and throughout the work we sum over the repeated indices ) .",
    "we will denote the axes of the rotated frame by @xmath60 .",
    "since in the symmetric case we currently consider all the reductions @xmath29 are of the same form , we can sum the inequalities ( [ ppt2 ] ) over all pairs of qubits : @xmath61 , without affecting the inequality sign .",
    "however , before we do so , we extend @xmath62 from the space of the qubits @xmath63 to the full hilbert space of @xmath0 qubits by : @xmath64 .",
    "then , we obtain that : @xmath65 now we can plug the pauli matrix decomposition of @xmath62 into eq .",
    "( [ gowno ] ) , and , using the identity : @xmath66 obtain the desired form of the condition ( [ ppt ] ) , i.e. a symmetric state @xmath7 possesses bipartite entanglement iff there exist @xmath67 and @xmath68 , such that the following inequality holds : @xmath69-(n-1)\\text{cos}\\varphi \\langle j_{\\bf n } \\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\langle j^2_{\\bf n}\\rangle + \\frac{n(n-2)}{4}<0,\\label{2x2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the averages are taken w.r.t .",
    "the full state @xmath7 .    in case of a general ,",
    "i.e. not necessarily symmetric , state @xmath7 observe that , if there exist @xmath67 and @xmath68 the same for all pairs of qubits , and such that the sum ( [ gowno ] ) is negative , then there must be at least one pair @xmath63 for which @xmath70 , and hence the state @xmath7 possesses bipartite entanglement .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ 2x2 ] ) is also a sufficient condition for bipartite entanglement for general states .    for a given negative eigenvalue vector @xmath30",
    "the left hand side of the inequality ( [ 2x2 ] ) is completely determined .",
    "however , we can also treat it as a function of the parameters of @xmath30 , and as such it can be optimized . in particular",
    ", keeping the frame @xmath71 fixed , we can search for the minimum w.r.t .",
    "@xmath52 . let us call this minimum @xmath72 . clearly ,",
    "if the inequality ( [ 2x2 ] ) is satisfied for some @xmath52 , then it will be also satisfied for @xmath72 , and vice versa .",
    "hence , it is enough to check the condition ( [ 2x2 ] ) only for @xmath72 . performing the minimization",

    "_ if there exist mutually orthogonal directions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 such that the inequality ( [ 2x2min ] ) holds , then the state @xmath7 possesses bipartite entanglement . for symmetric states",
    "the above condition is both necessary and sufficient . _    in the latter case , due to the equality : @xmath79 the criterion ( [ 2x2min ] ) can be simplified to : @xmath80    the relation of the criterion ( [ 2x2min ] ) to the standard spin squeezing condition ( [ xi ] ) is the following .",
    "spin-@xmath14 state can be equivalently represented as a symmetric state of @xmath81 qubits .",
    "intuitively , spin squeezing should refer to the existence of non - classical correlations among the qubits @xcite .",
    "indeed , the criterion ( [ 2x2 ] ) provides a rigorous proof for this intuitive picture , as , on one hand , if the condition ( [ xi ] ) is satisfied , then the inequality ( [ 2x2 ] ) is satisfied as well , since in this particular case @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "hence , spin-@xmath14 squeezed states possess 2-qubit entanglement @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we broaden the standard definition of spin squeezing ( [ xi ] ) , and allow the direction @xmath15 to be arbitrary , then we also obtain the converse statement : the condition ( [ 2x2 ] ) implies the existence of a spin component @xmath84 , such that @xmath85 .",
    "note however , that from the condition ( [ 2x2 ] ) it does not follow that the direction of squeezing @xmath15 is orthogonal to @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we obtain a more general type of squeezing . in section iv we will show somewhat extreme examples of state , for which @xmath15 is actually parallel to the mean spin .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the presence of bipartite entanglement is detected by the second order moments of the total spin .",
    "given our methods , it is natural to expect that the tripartite entanglement should be detectable by third order moments of @xmath87 . in this sections",
    "we derive the corresponding generalized squeezing inequalities in the most generic form , valid for arbitrary quantum states of systems of qubits .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we begin with considering symmetric states first .",
    "recall that the ppt criterion still works for the tripartite reductions @xmath88 of such states @xcite , and there are two families of potential negative - eigenvalue - vectors of @xmath89 @xcite : @xmath90 here , matrices @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the action of @xmath95 on the pauli matrices in the decomposition of @xmath62 now induces restricted , i.e. orientation and time - orientation preserving , lorentz transformations : @xmath96 ( greek indices run through @xmath97 ) , and the ppt condition takes the following form : @xmath98 ( note the summation convention ) .",
    "tensor @xmath99 reads : @xmath100 for the @xmath4-family ( [ ghz ] ) , and @xcite : @xmath101 for the @xmath1-family ( [ w ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath102 is the four - dimensional embedding of the rotation generated by @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , and the round brackets @xmath103 around indices denote symmetrization , e.g. @xmath104 note that the relativistic notation is used only for our convenience .",
    "we could have as well put all the indices at the same level as we are _ _ n__ot going to lower or rise them with the minkowski metric .",
    "next , we sum the inequalities ( [ poly2 ] ) over all triples of qubits : @xmath105 , just like we summed the inequalities ( [ ppt2 ] ) in the previous section : @xmath106 because of the symmetry condition ( [ symetr ] ) , we can rewrite eq . ( [ suma3 ] ) as follows : @xmath107 and observe that due to the action of @xmath20 , we can substitute @xmath108 with the symmetrized product @xmath109 .",

    "( [ kghz ] ) , or by eq .",
    "( [ kw ] ) . _    for a general state @xmath7 we could , as in the previous section , generate a sufficient entanglement condition by applying the same witness @xmath62 , with @xmath30 given by eq .",
    "( [ ghz ] ) or by eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , to all tripartite reductions @xmath88 .",
    "however , then we can not use the symmetry arguments like we used in eq .",
    "( [ suma3 ] ) , and directly apply the identity ( [ masakra ] ) . instead",
    ", we construct from the families ( [ ghz ] ) and ( [ w ] ) different witnesses , given for the @xmath1-family ( [ w ] ) by : @xmath124 ( we have omitted tensor product signs , @xmath125 , for compactness ) , and analogously for the @xmath4-family ( [ ghz ] ) .",
    "we then apply the witnesses ( [ skurwisyn ] ) to all tripartite reductions of @xmath7 , which effectively leads to the substitution of @xmath99 by @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( [ suma3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we can use eq .",
    "( [ masakra ] ) again and arrive at the condition ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) .",
    "the price to pay , apart from the mere sufficiency of the condition ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) , is that the witnesses ( [ skurwisyn ] ) make no distinction between biseparable tripartite reductions ( which now are not forbidden by the symmetry ) and genuine 3-qubit entangled ones , and hence , the inequality ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) indicates only general 3-qubit entanglement .",
    "however , note that the set of all biseparable states is closed , and hence each genuine 3-qubit entangled state possesses an open neighborhood consisting of only genuine 3-qubit entangled states .",
    "thus , the criterion ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) also detects genuine 3-qubit entangled states in some open vicinity of symmetric states , but the size of this vicinity is a priori not known ( the same remark applies to the criterion ( [ 2x2 ] ) as well ) .",
    "we will partially solve this drawback using another witnesses in section vi .",
    "there exists a famous and experimentally accessible family of symmetric states , called dicke states @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\label{psi }    ( perm stands for all possible remaining permutations ) , which are generalizations of @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-states @xmath128 : @xmath129 dicke states correspond ( in spin @xmath130 language ) to a fully symmetric flip of @xmath131 out of @xmath0 spins .",
    "such states appear in many physical processes , such as superradiance , superfluorescence .",
    "as we already mentioned , they can also be realized with photons ( where the qubits are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom ) , or trapped ion systems ( where the qubits correspond to two internal states of ions ) . in this section",
    "we specify and apply our general results of the previous sections to the dicke states .",
    "we explicitly construct for @xmath132 the inequalities ( [ 2x2min ] ) and ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we derive all necessary expressions for the analysis of the experimental data on @xmath2- and @xmath3-qubit @xmath1-states , which we will perform in the next section .    for practical reasons , we choose the number of excited qubits @xmath131 to be smaller than the integer part of @xmath133 . also note that alternatively the states ( [ psi ] ) can be defined as the eigenstates of the total angular momentum : @xmath134 where @xmath135 and the coefficients are given by the following binomials : @xmath136 in the basis @xmath137 the partially transposed matrix @xmath138 is given by : @xmath139 in the generic case , when all the constants from eqs .",

    "although in theory both inequalities ( [ 2x2min ] ) and ( [ 2x2 ] ) are equivalent , and we could use the latter due to simplicity , the inequality to be measured is rather ( [ 2x2min ] ) as in real - life experiments one does not obtain perfectly symmetric states . using eq .",

    "since there are two generically different negative eigenvalues , there will be two different spin squeezing inequalities ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) .",

    "the spread in the expectation values of the observable of interest can be estimated . for density matrices close to pure states , we observe that the purity of the reconstructed matrices often slightly decreases ( for the @xmath241 states by about 2% ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the reconstruction process rather underestimates the entanglement in the experimentally produced quantum states .      for an investigation of the experimental imperfections and scalability , we simulate the preparation procedure by solving the schrdinger equation with the relevant imperfections .",

    "still the simulation time for the generation of a @xmath242state under these idealized conditions is already 20 minutes on a 3 ghz processor using matlab .",
    "as the computational time for the simulations scales with @xmath243 , it is quite demanding to include a reasonable environment or even use a density matrix approach .    the fidelity reduction of @xmath244 for the different imperfections are as follows : 0.1 ( addressing error ) , 0.07 ( off  resonant excitations ) , 0.04 [ laser frequency noise ( 200  hz rms ) ] .",
    "we note here that as opposed to e.g. experiments on teleportation @xcite or the cirac ",
    "zoller controlled  not @xcite , phase noise ( caused by the laser frequency noise or magnetic field noise ) contributes here much less .",
    "another possible error source is imperfect ground state cooling .",
    "intensity noise of the 729laser ( @xmath245 ) does not contribute significantly .",
    "finally , we experimentally observed non  ideal optical pumping which can result in a reduction of 0.02 of the fidelity per ion . for @xmath246 , we therefore minimize the errors due to optical pumping and a part of the addressing errors by checking the initialization procedure with a detection sequence ( see tab .  [ creation_sequence ] ) . due to this",
    "improvements , the addressing error reduces the fidelity of the @xmath244 state by only 0.05 and the optical pumping errors are basically excluded .",
    "furthermore , we switched the blue - sideband pulses adiabatically w.r.t . the trap frequency , such that fourier components at the carrier transition do not lead to off - resonant excitations . taking this new situation into account ,",
    "the fidelity should be of the order of 0.91 . even though it is hard to estimate the expected fidelity for @xmath190",
    ", it seems that the discrepancy between the model and the experiment is even larger for @xmath190 .",
    "a small part of these discrepancies could be due to the quantum projection noise in the measurement process as described in the section on state tomography .",
    "however , looking at the density matrices in detail , we observe that the @xmath247 state seems always quite strongly populated , especially for large @xmath0 .",
    "so far we have no good explanation for this .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it has already been shown that the states are genuine multipartite entangled , multipartite distillable and also that all the reduced two - qubit states are entangled .",

    "we find that : @xmath252 and hence the spin squeezing inequality ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "however , as we mentioned at the end of section iii , the validity of the inequality ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) only proves the presence of _ some _ form of tripartite entanglement and a priori we do not know if it is genuine 3-qubit entanglement .",
    "let us now discuss the eight qubit case . here",

    "the tripartite criterion gives : @xmath255 thus both criteria detect entanglement again .",
    "the general form of squeezing inequalities of sections ii and iii is complicated and remains such even when specified to dicke states .",
    "it is therefore desirable to derive alternative inequalities , which are weaker , but have a simple form .",
    "in fact , in ref . @xcite it was proposed to use less general witnesses , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , than those provided by the ppt criterion for the 3-qubit case : @xmath256 where now we allow the vectors @xmath257 and @xmath258 to be defined in an arbitrary frame @xmath259 , the same for all three qubits .",
    "apart from the simplicity , the advantage of such an approach over the general criterion ( [ 2x2x2 ] ) is that the above witnesses detect genuine 3 qubit entanglement in generic states .",
    "we derived the spin squeezing inequalities corresponding to @xmath260 using the same technique as in section iii : we expressed the sums @xmath261 with the total spin operators ( [ s ] ) .",
    "however , instead of using the general formula ( [ masakra ] ) , we calculated explicitly the occurring products of pauli matrices ( or in other words we used special cases of eq .",
    "( [ masakra ] ) ) .",
    "this led us to the following sufficient criteria for the ghz - type entanglement @xcite : @xmath262 and for the ghz- or w - type entanglement : @xmath263    the witnesses ( [ wghz]-[ww2 ] ) still have a disadvantage that in the sums @xmath264 , the identity gives the dominant contribution , and hence the bigger the system the less sensitive the witnesses become .",
    "one possible method to partially overcome this problem is to project the witnesses ( [ wghz]-[ww2 ] ) onto the symmetric subspace of the space of three qubits : @xmath265 where : @xmath266 the factor @xmath267 in the definition ( [ pww1 ] ) is the maximum overlap between @xmath258 and symmetric separable states ( there are no symmetric biseparable states due to the symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "the criteria that such improved witnesses lead to , read respectively : @xmath268    the potential advantage of using @xmath269 instead of @xmath260 manifests itself only for non - symmetric states . for symmetric states ,",
    "both families give the same results ( apart from @xmath270 due to the factor @xmath267 ) , as we can always substitute @xmath88 with @xmath271 in eq .",
    "( [ sw ] ) .",
    "let us apply the above witnesses to the dicke states @xmath132 of section iv .",
    "as one can easily see from eq .",
    "( [ pizda ] ) , only @xmath272 and @xmath270 have a chance to detect genuine tripartite entanglement , but not for all @xmath0 and @xmath131 . for example , for @xmath273 , @xmath272 detects entanglement only for @xmath274 , and @xmath270  only for @xmath275 .",

    "@xcite , and apply it to the output of the recent ion trap experiment from ref .",

    "the detection method is based on the use of entanglement witnesses together with the concept of spin squeezing .",
