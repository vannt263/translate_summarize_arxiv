    "@xcite previously raised this possibility for the type ib sn  2005bf , and @xcite has independently shown their relevance as well .",
    "we show in  [ sec : simple ] that when the timescale of the magnetar spindown , @xmath11 , is comparable to the effective radiative diffusion time , @xmath12 , the resulting peak luminosity is @xmath13 , where @xmath14  is the magnetar rotational energy .",
