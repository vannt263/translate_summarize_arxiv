    "it is now widely accepted that black holes reside in the centre of nearly all galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion onto these black holes is believed to be the mechanism responsible for powering active galactic nuclei .",
    "the black holes in these galaxies can accrete matter , either from the interstellar medium close to the event horizon or from thick disks of gas . in order",
    "to be accreted , gas needs to fall in with an angular momentum that does not exceed that needed for disk capture . in the vicinity of the sphere of influence of the black hole ,",
    "the keplerian motion of the accreting material is exceedingly high , thus processes that redistribute the angular momentum of the accreting gas determine the accretion rate .",
    "galactic mergers , gravitational torques from bars and other structures can efficiently channel gas into the nuclear regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "closer to the sphere of influence of the black hole , however , other mechanisms , such as turbulence driven by magnetic instabilities , are efficient sources of angular momentum transport ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are different modes of accretion .",
    "the ` standard ' accretion mode occurs when matter is accreted onto the black hole through a radiatively efficient process .",
    "this is generally associated with optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disks , and thought to be associated with quasar activity .",
    "this process is likely to be prevalent where there is a plentiful supply of cold gas , which can accrete efficiently towards the black hole , and as such the fuel , in the form of the cold gas , should also be able to condense and provide the fuel for star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indirect evidence for such a scenario comes from the similar evolution of the agn activity in the universe and the star - formation rate density , both increasing rapidly from @xmath5 and steadily turning over at @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , such a close connection between agn and star - formation activity may provide a relatively straightforward explanation of the local correlation between galaxy mass and black - hole mass @xcite .",
    "accretion in an agn may also be radiatively inefficient .",
    "when mass accretion is too low ( @xmath7 ) , the inflowing gas may not be able to radiate the gravitational potential energy liberated due to accretion .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that the energy dissipated during accretion could heat up only the ions in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , radiative losses , synchrotron radiation , and comptonization of low - energy photons take energy from the electrons , cooling them .",
    "the characteristic time - scale for the hot ions and the cold electrons to achieve thermal equilibrium through coupling depends on the gas temperature in the vicinity of the black hole , and is inversely proportional to the number density of ions .",
    "when the accretion rate is low , the ionic density is also small , and this time - scale is of the same order as , or larger than , the inflow time .",
    "thus a two - temperature plasma is expected to form when @xmath7 . in this regime ,",
    "advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) can be formed .",
    "this radiatively inefficient process is currently taken as the most likely explanation for accretion flows around black holes at low accretion rates",
    ". the critical accretion rate below which it becomes radiatively inefficient is estimated to be @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the efficiency of angular momentum transport in disks . with the standard value of @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the critical accretion rate is situated around @xmath11 normalised to the eddington accretion rate . due to the inability of the gas to cool down radiatively in this regime",
    ", the gas can be driven to a higher temperature , and thus cause a vertical thickening of the disk .",
    "adafs are thus thought to be characteristic of hot thick disks .",
    "what causes the different modes of radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion remains uncertain .",
    "it has been suggested that the nature of the gas being accreted might determine the type of accretion , with cold gas producing a stable accretion disk and thus a radiatively efficient accretion , and hot gas producing flows that would result in an adaf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the black hole spin has also been suggested to play a role in determining the accretion mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "radio galaxies are a class of agn that can be divided into two sub - categories according to the ratio between the intensity of high and low excitation emission lines in their optical spectra : low excitation galaxies ( legs ) and high excitation galaxies ( hegs ) .",
    "the two distinct classes were first noted by @xcite and further categorised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined legs as objects that obey the following requirements : have [ o iii]-line equivalent widths @xmath12 , have a ratio @xmath13/[o{\\sc iii}]>1 $ ] , or both .",
    "it is widely accepted that legs could be the result of radiatively inefficient accretion processes .",
    "@xcite compared a large number of local radio - loud agn and concluded that the heg and leg populations show different accretion rate distributions , consistent with the idea that radiative efficiency is determined purely on accretion rate .",
    "this is a subject that impacts on the most relevant issues for models of agn and their roles in galaxy evolution . for instance , if the heg / leg distinction is indeed related to the accretion process , then the fact that their radio properties are similar requires that the power being channeled into the jets is independent of the accretion rate .",
    "moreover , given that radiatively efficient accretion is related to the ` quasar mode ' form of feedback processes in agn , and radiatively inefficient accretion associated with ` radio mode ' agn feedback in semi - analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the heg and leg characterisation could be used to diagnose the different modes at play in each system .",
    "legs would for instance be the perfect laboratories to investigate the ` radio mode ' form of feedback , currently taken as being the principal mechanism responsible for shutting down star formation in the most massive systems at @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the heg / leg division in radio - loud sources and their different accretion processes , extending the study of @xcite to high - redshift sources ( @xmath15 ) . moving to high redshift",

    "the narrow - line selection was intended to ensure the exclusion of quasars from the sample ( though 3c343 has since been classified as a quasar and 3c22 is classified as a weak quasar ) .",

    "given the uncertainties affecting the aperture , emission - line contamination and galactic extinction corrections , we assume an additional @xmath41 per cent error in the flux density for each magnitude value that had any of these corrections applied .",

    "the photometric data span a wavelength range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the emission from radio galaxies - obscured agn - is dominated by the stellar emission of the host galaxy .",
    "at mid - infrared wavelengths , dust in the ` torus ' region that re - emits the radiation from the central agn is the main source of emission , at least for those sources with a relatively powerful and radiatively efficient agn .",
    "this can be thought of as a composite of the central emission passing through a screen of dust .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and model the radio galaxies with a galaxy template that dominates the emission in the optical part of the spectrum and a quasar template , extinguished by a dust extinction law , to fit the emission in the infrared spectral region .      to replicate the host galaxy emission , we consider a bruzual and charlot stellar synthesis model ( * ? ? ?",

    "fuel - consumption ' stellar population synthesis model ( * ? ? ?",

    "we assume a salpeter initial mass function and solar metallicity .    since radio galaxies are almost exclusively hosted by elliptical galaxies or recent merger remnants ( e.g. * ?",

    "* ) , we expect them to have a strong short episode of star formation in the beginning of their formation and for the star formation rate to quickly drop subsequently .",
    "therefore , we consider that a single simple stellar population suffices to reproduce the host galaxy s star formation history , and a synthesis of ssps is not required .",
    "to select the stellar age of our template we note that our objects all have @xmath15 , when , according to the adopted cosmology , the universe was @xmath44 old .",

    "this can be done , as an approximation , by assuming that a radio galaxy is equivalent to a quasar with a layer of obscuring dust in front of it , where this layer can have diverse column densities depending on how obscured the galaxy is ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , @xcite find that they can reproduce a diversity of rest - frame @xmath57 seds of radio galaxies by combining various amounts of extinction of agn light with host galaxy starlight .",
    "this representation is consistent with the orientation - dependent unified scheme and it is intended as a simplification only , as a more careful approximation should fully account for radiative transfer effects in a dusty medium ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "this approach would , however , imply a large number of free parameters with too few data points to constrain them , resulting in a high degeneracy , making it difficult to infer physically meaningful quantities .",
    "thus , we build , as a simplification , a composite model of a quasar and a screen of dust .    as a quasar template ,",
    "we use the radio - quiet quasar sed by @xcite , which was constructed based on the mean energy distribution of a sample of 29 radio - quiet quasars .",

    "these templates are described by the following summation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 vary for each term and for each dust type ( see table  4 of @xcite for a full description ) .",

    "smc dust has been found to be appropriate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , for more obscured quasars , and in particular for the majority of the objects in our sample , we find that smc dust does not provide as good a fit as mw dust .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that the dust intersecting the line of sight of the central emission in obscured galaxies comes from the inner region due to the galaxy s edge - on orientation , and the central regions of galaxies are usually more metal rich , as there is in general a metallicity gradient in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , we adopted a mw dust type for all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we fit our model to the photometric data points by applying an extinction curve to the intrinsic quasar light template and then adding it to the galaxy light model : @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the quasar light template and @xmath70 is the quasar light model already affected by extinction .    to convert the extinction law @xmath71 to magnitudes ( @xmath72 ) we multiply equation by the term @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the ratio of total - to - selective extinction defined by the equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the colour excess .",

    "we repeat this process for all the different stellar models we are considering ( ages 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6gyr for both bc03 and m05 models ) and choose the model that has the lowest @xmath82 amongst these .",
    "+ sources that are detected below a 2@xmath113 level in the imaging data are plotted as upper limits at a 2@xmath113 level .",
    "we use their measured photometric flux for the sed fitting and place their error bars between zero and the detection limit for the @xmath82 evaluation .",
