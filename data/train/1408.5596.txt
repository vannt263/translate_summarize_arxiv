    "in the early phase of star formation , it is thought that mass is accreted by the central star .",
    "fu ori - type objects provide direct observational evidence for the mass outbursts with short duration time ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain fu ori - type outbursts .",
    "there are famous three types of models , including the thermal instability ( ti ) model ( bell & lin ) , gravitational instability ( gi ) model ( vorobyov & basu , ) , and gravo - magneto limit cycle ( gml ) model ( armitage et al .",
    ", zhu et al . , and martin & lubow ) .",
    "bell & lin ( ) discussed whether thermal instability in the inner region of the disk can explain outbursts .",
    "they obtained the steady state solutions of the accretion disk , and they showed the results on @xmath4 versus @xmath6 plane . in their model , they succeeded in explaining time scales of outburst with taking into account of vertical convection of the disk and radial heat flux .",
    "they predict that outbursts occur in the region @xmath7 and @xmath8 . however , the temperature which ti occur is too high for protostellar disk if we consider the early phase of disk formation .",
    "zhu et al .",
    "( , ) pointed out that ti model can not work for fu ori because the region with high accretion rate is required to extend to @xmath9 .    using two - dimensional simulations of star and",
    "disk formation , vorobyov & basu ( , ) discussed the gi model .",
    "it is shown that formed via disk gravitational fragmentation at @xmath10 in the early phase of the disk formation can be driven into the central region and cause the mass accretion outbursts . however , due to the use of a sink cell , vorobyov & basu ( , ) could not follow the disk evolution in the inner @xmath0 au .",
    "although they assume the mass accretion rate onto their sink cell as that onto the star , the validity of this assumption is unclear . to help resolve this problem ,",
    "in this paper we consider the inner region of the disk ( hereafter the inner disk ) .    in the third gml model of outbursts in the inner region of the disk ,",
    "magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is used to explain outbursts ( armitage et al .",
    ", zhu et al . , , , and martin & lubow ) . in gml model , the disk has two states ; which are mri - active state when @xmath11 and mri - inactive state when @xmath12 ) , where most of dust components evaporate , thus eliminating a major source of sink for current - carring electrons . ] . in gml model ,",
    "spontaneous outbursts are driven by the state transition between mri active and inactive state .",
    "the transition is caused by mismatches of mass accretion rate between inner and outer region of the disk .",
    "in the view point of angular momentum transport , mri is dominant in the inner region ( @xmath13 ) and gi is dominant in the outer region ( @xmath14 ) of the disk .",
    "gml model of outbursts is demonstrated by numerical calculation , where outburst is associating with the time variation of mri active / inactive state in the inner region of the disk ( armitage et al .",
    ", zhu et al . , , and ) .",
    "previous studies of the gml model were limited to the case of a temporally constant mass accretion rate onto the inner disk . according to studies of the gi model , accretion rate onto the inner disk",
    "is expected to be varying in time . in this paper",
    ", we consider the role for the inner disk in time variation of mass accretion rate onto the inner disk .",
    "the viscous evolution of the inner disk ( @xmath15 ) is solved with taking into account both the outbursts driven by gml and the time variable mass accretion rate onto the inner disk . in order to understand the time variability of mass accretion rate onto the star ,",
    "first we consider the above two processes independently . in section 2 , using a simple model of viscous accretion disk , we show the accretion rate at near the surface of protostar as the responses to the episodic accretion at the outer boundary . in section 3 ,",
    "features of outbursts driven by gml are shown with temporally constant accretion rate onto outer boundary of the inner disk . in section 4",
    ", we obtain the time variability of accretion rate as a result of combination of outer episodic accretion and gml .",
    "we discuss implications of our results and future work in section 5 .",
    "our results are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the accretion disk model that we use in this paper describes on the unsteady , viscous accretion process of the circumstellar disk by assuming that the disk is axisymmetric and geometrically thin .",
    "all the equations are integrated in the vertical direction in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the system is described by a one - dimensional equation dependent on time @xmath17 and radial distance @xmath18 .",
    "we apply this disk model to the inner disk .",
    "first , we investigate the simple response of the inner disk to the oscillating accretion onto the outer boundary of the inner disk . note that mass accretion rate onto the outer region in our model corresponds to the accretion rate onto the sink cell in previous works on the gi model ( e.g. , vorobyov & basu ) .",
    "we assume that the pressure gradient force is negligible , and the accretion speed within the disk is sufficiently slow as @xmath19 where @xmath6 is the surface density , @xmath20 is the radial velocity , and @xmath21 is azimuthal velocity which is assumed to be keplerian @xmath22 . as a result , viscous evolution of the surface density @xmath6",
    "is described by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angular velocity and @xmath25 is viscous coefficient ( e.g. , pringle and  7.2 in hartmann ) .",
    "a hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath26-direction is assumed .",
    "then the scale height @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "as angular momentum transport , the standard @xmath29 prescription for viscous disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) is employed . by this prescription , viscous coefficient @xmath25 in equation ( [ diffusiveeq ] )",
    "is given by @xmath30 . in this section ,",

    "the diffusion time @xmath40 at @xmath37 is about @xmath41 in this case . for the mass accretion rate onto the disk outer edge , supposedly mimicking a periodic effect of gi in the outer disk , we adopt the following form @xmath42 } , \\label{mdotouter}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are constant parameters . using equation ( [ mdotouter ] ) ,",
    "time averaged value of mass accretion rate at the outer boundary in one period of oscillation is given as @xmath46 .",
    "equation ( [ mdotouter ] ) includes the case of constant @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( [ mdotouter ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 is used in this section . as the inner boundary condition",
    ", we use a free boundary , @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "we set the grid number @xmath54 , @xmath55 equally divided in logarithmic space , and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . for the initial conditions",
    ", we set power law distributions for @xmath58 .",
    "however , initial conditions are unimportant because the inner disk forgets them after several diffusion time scales .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure1b.eps    the time evolution of the mass accretion rate at @xmath59 and @xmath60 are shown in figure 1 for the case with @xmath61 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) . from figure 1 ( a ) , where @xmath63 , it is seen that mass accretion rate at @xmath59 , @xmath64 ( dotted line ) has a large oscillation amplitude while mass accretion rate at @xmath60 , @xmath65 ( solid line ) has a small amplitude .",
    "this means that the inner disk acts to smooth out oscillations in the mass accretion onto the disk s outer edge and the true accretion rate onto the star exhibits little time variability . from figure 1 ( a )",
    ", it is also seen that mass accretion rate at @xmath60 is almost the same as the time - averaged value of mass accretion rate at the outer boundary @xmath66 , rather than @xmath67 .",
    "this means that if @xmath63 , @xmath34 approaches @xmath68 in small @xmath18 limit . in figure 1 ( b ) , where @xmath69 , it is seen that the oscillation amplitude of mass accretion rate is similar at the inner and outer boundaries of the inner disk , although the oscillation of mass accretion rate at the inner boundary slightly decays due to viscous diffusion in the inner disk . in summary , mass accretion rate onto the protostar tends to be different from that onto the sink cell due to viscous diffusion .",
    "mass accretion rate onto the protostar approaches the time - averaged value @xmath70 when @xmath71 and the time variability of the mass accretion rate is weakly affected when @xmath72 .",
    "in this section , we investigate features of outbursts driven by the gml model . time variability of mass accretion rate at @xmath60 is investigated using steady mass accretion rate onto the outer boundary @xmath59 of the inner disk @xmath1 by solving equation ( [ diffusiveeq ] ) . in this subsection ,",
    "the effects of mri and gi are effectively included in @xmath29 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a viscous parameter which mimics angular momentum transport induced by the mri , and @xmath75 is viscous parameter which mimics angular momentum transport induced by gravitational instabilities . as for @xmath74 , we take into account for the mri active / inactive state by @xmath76 and @xmath77 as , @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80 is the critical temperature ( see also zhu et al . ) .",
    "a small but nonzero value of @xmath81 mimics a finite amount of angular momentum transport in the mri active surface layer around the dead zone in mri inactive region .",
    "since the exact value of @xmath81 is not well known , we assume this value , which is sufficiently smaller than @xmath76 . viscous parameter @xmath75 is assumed to be @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the toomre s q - value ( @xcite ) , @xmath84 is the epicyclic frequency for a keplerian disk , @xmath85 is the critical q - value below which gravitational torque acts , and @xmath86 is the dimensionless number which represents the efficiency of angular momentum transport ( lin & pringle ) .",
    "according to the three - dimensional hydrodynamical calculations in kratter et al .",
    "( ) , @xmath87 is indicated when the disk is gravitationally unstable .",
    "boley et al .",
    "( ) indicates that angular momentum transport by gravitational torque is important when @xmath88 . in this paper , @xmath89 is adopted , and several cases with @xmath90 are considered .    to calculate the temperature ,",
    "local thermal equilibrium between the viscous heating rate @xmath91 and radiative cooling rate @xmath92 is assumed , i.e. , @xmath93 each term is given by , @xmath94 with stephan - boltzmann constant @xmath95 and the opacity @xmath96 . for simplicity",
    ", we use the constant opacity @xmath97 , which is the averaged value of @xmath96 between several @xmath98 to @xmath99 in pollack et al .",
    "sound speed @xmath31 and viscous parameter @xmath29 are obtained when we solve the system of equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ radiatra ] ) , using the description of @xmath30 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the specific heat ratio , @xmath103 is the boltzman s constant , @xmath104 is the molecular weight , and @xmath105 is the mass of hydrogen . equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ radiatra ] ) constitute a non - linear set of equations with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "we solve @xmath29 and @xmath31 iteratively using newton s method . in this section ,",
    "equation ( [ mdotouter ] ) with @xmath48 is used as the outer boundary condition .",
    "initial conditions , inner boundary conditions , and the grid number are the same as in section 2 , except that boundary conditions for @xmath31 is treated as @xmath106 at @xmath53 and @xmath107 .",
    "we investigate such features the interval and duration of outbursts driven by the gml , assuming that the mass accretion rate onto the inner disk is temporally constant . in table 1 ,",
    "model parameters in this section are summarized .",
    "we terminate our calculation after outbursts occur a few dozen times or when the inner disk becomes a steady state without outburst .",
    ".parameters of equations in this paper [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      first , we have simplified the condition whether mri is active or not . in this paper ,",
    "the condition for mri activation is represented as @xmath108 since we consider that collisional ionization is effective above @xmath109 owing to the dust sublimation .",
    "actually , however , the ionization rate determines activity of the mri .",
    "ionization rate has strong gradient in vertical direction because it is related to the density , temperature , and external ionizing sources @xcite .",
    "this fact implies that @xmath110 strongly depends on vertical coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "some previous studies include this effect approximately by using the layered accretion model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , we use more simple treatment in which @xmath110 is assumed to be constant for @xmath26 because the layered accretion is not essential component for the outbursts by gml model .",
    "we should include the vertical structure of the disks in order to treat the effects of mri more precisely .",
    "this treatment requires at least two - dimensional calculation .",
    "second , the efficiency of the angular momentum transport by gi is controversial .",
    "there are some formula of @xmath111 based on analytic consideration @xcite or fitting to numerical results @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite claimed that gravitational torque can not be expressed in alpha prescription .",
    "alpha prescription is founded on the assumption that the torque acts as local stress .",
    "since gravity is long - range force , the assumption is not well satisfied . in order to establish the gml model as the robust mechanism of the outbursts ,",
    "it is necessary to check whether the gravitational torque could be represented by the alpha prescription or not . to investigate this problem , non",
    "- axial symmetric calculations are necessary .",
    "finally , we fix the outer radius @xmath112 that is the sink radius of the @xcite . according to their simulation , the clumps made around @xmath113 au are able to arrive at the sink radius .",
    "they are expected to be destroyed by the tidal force from the protostar if they approach closer to it than tidal radius @xmath114 ( nayakshin , tsukamoto et al . ) . in this paper , we adopt one - dimensional model with axial symmetry to describe the inner disk .",
    "in the situation that clumps exist , axial symmetry is not valid , and our model should not be used .",
    "once clumps are destroyed , it is expected that their remnants spread around the protostar to form a disk that is moderately axial - symmetric .",
    "our model is likely to be available in @xmath115 , and thus , we should set @xmath116 . if tidal radius @xmath114 is smaller than the radius of protostar , gi model could be feasible to explain outburst because the clump is expected to fall onto the protostar directly .",
    "the reasonable estimation of the tidal radius for each clump is important to determine the mechanism that triggers the outbursts .",
    "this problem also needs non - axial symmetric calculations . to improve all physical processes we discussed above , we need three - dimensional calculations in principle .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the role of the inner disk @xmath117 from the central star in the time dependent mass accretion flow . in order to understand property of time variation of mass accretion rate onto the central star",
    ", we considered viscous evolution of the inner disk taking into account both of gravo - magneto limit cycle ( gml ) and time variable mass accretion rate onto the inner disk .",
    "we assumed the @xmath29-descreption in order to treat transport of angular momentum driven by both of gi and mri .",
    "our results and findings are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "mass accretion rate onto the protostar tends to be different from that onto the inner disk partly due to the viscous diffusion . in the case with temporally constant viscous parameter @xmath25 , when @xmath71 mass accretion rate @xmath34 approaches the time - averaged value of @xmath1 in a single period @xmath70 as @xmath118 , and when @xmath72 time variability of mass accretion rate remains .",
    "\\2 . outburst driven by the gml can occur under the condition that constant mass accretion rate onto the inner disk is @xmath119 .",
    "the low boundary for the steady accretion rate sensitively depends on the @xmath81 , which we know little about . in this range of @xmath1 , among the features of outbursts such as @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 ,",
    "only the interval between outburst @xmath121 is a function of @xmath1 .",
    "difference in @xmath1 does not affect @xmath122 but it does affects @xmath121 .",
    "large @xmath1 results in short @xmath121 .",
    "large @xmath1 do not appear directly in the amplitude of @xmath2 .",
    "even with a fluctuated mass accretion rate onto the inner disk at @xmath59 , the gml can drive outbursts although fluctuations of @xmath4 may decay when passing the inner disk inwards .",
    "we newly identified two modes of outburst which are spontaneous one and stimulated one . in the case with @xmath124",
    "smaller than @xmath125 , outburst is a spontaneous one in which @xmath126 , and in the case with the @xmath124 greater than @xmath125 , outburst is a stimulated one in which @xmath127 , where @xmath124 is the averaged value of @xmath1 during several kyr .",
    "the important results in the present paper are that mass accretion rate onto the sink cell does not always appear directly in mass accretion rate onto the star ( the latter determinng the accretion luminosity ) , but we suggest that the interval between outbursts is possibly used as a probe for mass accretion rate .",
