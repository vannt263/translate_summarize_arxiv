    "the charge - ordering ( co ) transition is often encountered in complex transition - metal oxides ( tmo ) and has been the focus of intense inquiry and debate in condensed matter science in the past years . the metal - insulator transition that occurs as the temperature decreases across the co transition temperature , _ _",
    "t__@xmath7 , is associated with a change from an itinerant electronic state to a more localized state .",
    "the co state plays an important role in various systems , including the superconducting cuprates and the proximity of the superconducting state to a spin / charge stripe ordered state,[1 ] colossal - magnetoresistive manganites , where the co states compete with ferromagnetic metallic states,[2 ] and layered nickelates , which form a small polaron lattice.[3 ] therefore , understanding the causes and implications of co phenomena is significantly important .",
    "the co state is also often closely associated with magnetic and orbital ordering , and it is widely recognized that co can arise from a variety of competing interactions , most importantly the intersite coulomb interaction , magnetic exchange energy , and electron - phonon interactions , all of which are strongly dependent on the valence states of neighboring metal ions .",
    "the sr - doped rare earth ferrite _",
    "_ r__@xmath0sr@xmath1feo@xmath2 ( _ _ r__sfo ) is an interesting example of a co system where magnetic exchange energy is thought to play a crucial , if not dominant , role in the stability of the co state . _",
    "_ r__sfo is a perovskite based crystal where the fe ion adopts a formal fractional valence of 3.67 + . below _ _",
    "t__@xmath7 , it has been proposed that charge disproportionation occurs according to 3fe@xmath8 @xmath9 2fe@xmath10 + fe@xmath11 , with the different iron valences ordering in planes containing a repeating arrangement of 3 + , 3 + , 5 + ions perpendicular to the body diagonal [ 111]@xmath12.[4 , 5 ] the co occurs simultaneously with antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "recently , we used inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements of the spin wave spectrum to demonstrate the plausibility that the magnetic exchange energy is the dominant interaction giving rise to co in la@xmath0sr@xmath1feo@xmath2 ( lsfo).[6 ] our results show that the observed co ground state can be stabilized by large ferromagnetic ( f ) exchange ( _ _ j__@xmath3 ) occurring between the nearest - neighbor ( _ nn _ ) fe@xmath10-fe@xmath11 pairs .",
    "however , this conclusion was made based on the assumption that the intersite coulomb interaction ( i.e. the madelung energy ) is suppressed by strong electronic screening enabled by the small charge transfer ( ct ) gap ( several to 10 s of mev ) observed in the system.[6 ] since we can not directly determine the contribution of the coulomb interaction , one possible way to verify the dominance of the magnetic exchange mechanism is to measure the magnetic exchange energies in other _ _ r__sfo ( for example , _ r _ = pr and nd ) compounds . for the smaller pr@xmath10 and nd@xmath10 ions ,",
    "increased lattice distortions lead to a larger charge - transfer gap and a narrower electronic bandwidth .",
    "this should lead to reduced screening and increase the stability of the co state due to a greater influence of the coulomb interaction . however , _ _ t__@xmath13 and _ _ t__@xmath7 are known to be suppressed by smaller _ _ r__@xmath10.[5 ] in 1998 , t. mizokawa and a. fujimori proposed that the @xmath5__j__@xmath3/__j__@xmath4@xmath5 exchange ratio is a good indicator of the propagation direction of co ordering in the limit where magnetic energy is dominant . if the ratio is larger than 1 , the charges will be ordered along [ 111 ] ; if the ratio is less than 1 , the charges will be ordered along [ 100].[7 ] thus , if neutron scattering measurements can indicate a weakening of the magnetic exchange ratio , this would give additional support to the magnetic mechanism for co.    to verify this hypothesis , we study the spin wave spectrum in _ _ r__sfo with different _ _ r__@xmath10 ions . based on ins measurement of the powder sample in principal , the magnetic exchange energies , _ _ j__@xmath3 and _ _ j__@xmath4 , can be obtained,[8 ] and the related exchange ratio could be calculated .",
    "the corresponding contribution of the magnetic energy to the co state could then be considered .",
    "however , the magnetic spectra of psfo and nsfo are not as simple as that of previously studied lsfo system,[6 ] where only fe moments contribute to the neutron magnetic cross - section , as the pr@xmath10 and nd@xmath10 ions themselves possess magnetic moments . the neutron intensity from crystal electronic field ( cef ) excitations of the magnetic pr@xmath10 and nd@xmath10 ions",
    "makes the extraction of the fe spin wave spectrum more complicated .",
    "to better account for the rare earth cef excitations , we also investigate the parent compounds , _ _",
    "r__fo ( _ r _ = pr and nd ) .",
    "all of the _ _ r__fo parent compounds are insulators with g - type antiferromagnetic ordering of fe atoms occurring at high temperatures ( _ _ t__@xmath13 @xmath14 700 k ) . the rare earth ions in _ _ r__fo are expected to have similar cef spectra to _",
    "_ r__sfo once the simple dilution of the rare earth site by sr is taken into account .",
    "after accounting for the cef intensities of the _ _",

    "r__sfo , the ins data may be compared to calculations of the spin wave spectra and their corresponding cross - sections using a heisenberg model .",

    "the mixtures were transferred to an al@xmath16o@xmath15 crucible and calcined several times in air at temperatures of 1100 @xmath19c and 1200 @xmath19c respectively for 24 hours .",
    "then , the press - formed pellets were sintered in air at 1250@xmath19c and 1350@xmath19c for 30 hours , respectively . as the ionic size decreases from la to nd , the _",

    "iii and viii , the increase of @xmath5__j__@xmath4@xmath5 in nsfo as compared to lsfo and psfo could arise from differences in the ct gap and/or the lattice distortion of these compounds .",
    "the ct gap of nsfo is larger than those of lsfo or psfo , hence electrons will be more localized and the magnitude of af exchange energy of nsfo is expected to increase .",

    "the effect of the lattice distortions in the _",
    "_ r__fo parent compounds is well understood .",
    "the tolerance factor , whose deviation from one indicates the propensity for lattice distortion , decreases from lfo to nfo ( see table ii ) . the larger lattice distortion in nfo results in smaller fe - o - fe bond - angles that weakens the af superexchange . the tolerance factor of the _ _ r__sfo compounds is closer to 1 than the parent _",

    "therefore , the large change in _ _",
    "j__@xmath4 is unlikely to arise from an average change of the doping induced structural distortions .",
    "using inelastic neutron scattering , we determined that the similar spin wave spectra of lsfo and psfo consist of two energy bands separated by a large energy gap , while the two bands merge into one in nsfo .",
    "the full magnetic bandwidth is determined mainly by the ferromagnetic exchange energy , _ _",
    "j__@xmath6 , between fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath11 ions , and is found to be similar for the different _ _ r__sfo compounds .",
    "the af exchange energies between fe@xmath10 ions , @xmath5__j__@xmath4@xmath5 , which controls the splitting of the upper and lower magnetic bands are more sensitive to _ r _ substitution .",
    "we determine _ _ j__@xmath6 and @xmath5__j__@xmath4@xmath5 by comparison to a heisenberg model .",
    "the ratio of these exchanges is an indicator of the role that magnetism plays in the formation of the charge ordered state .",
    "while lsfo and psfo are in the regime where magnetic exchange can stabilize the charge ordered state , the case for nsfo is not as clear .",
