    "rare @xmath2 decays have been the focus of many experimental and theoretical considerations@xcite .",
    "this is due to the amount of information on the standard model that can be extracted from these processes .",
    "the rare decays proceed through flavor - changing neutral current diagrams that are absent at the tree level and thus provide a good probe of the standard model at the loop level .",
    "for example , recent measurements of photon penguin induced processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 by the cleo group@xcite are consistent with the standard model predictions . likewise , the dilepton decay @xmath0 and corresponding exclusive modes will provide tests of the @xmath5 boson penguin and @xmath6 boson box diagrams which take over the photonic penguin diagram for large top quark mass . on the other hand , unlike the radiative @xmath2 decays , the dileptonic process are strongly dependent on the top quark mass @xmath7 through the dominant internal top quark line , so that a comparison between theoretical calculations as a function of @xmath7 and experimental data may lead to constraints on the top quark mass .",
    "such an exercise has been done with the current upper limit of @xmath8 ( @xmath9% cl ) , which gives the bound of @xmath10  gev on the top quark mass @xcite .",
    "these rare @xmath2 decays are also sensitive to quark mixing angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , hence their measurements yield valuable information on cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements and consequently shed some light on cp violation in the standard model . in this work we concentrate on the rare dileptonic decay @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is either an electron or a muon . ) .    while extensive investigations have been carried out for the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that to fully extract short - distance coefficients both in magnitude and in sign from experiments , one has to consider the angular distribution such as forward - backward charge asymmetry of the @xmath15 production in the decay @xmath16 , either .",
    "in addition , this asymmetry can be used to test the chirality of the @xmath17 transition .",
    "the process @xmath1 has been considered for the small recoil case where heavy quark symmetries apply  @xcite .",
    "recently , the dalize distribution of the exclusive rare dilepton decays has been derived in terms of various form factors  @xcite and the sensitivity of it to possible new physics has been investigated . in particular , it is shown that measurement of the transverse polarization of @xmath18 meson yields information on the coupling of the leptonic axial vector current to the left - handed quark current .",
    "it is the aim of this work to provide a comprehensive analysis of asymmetry for both inclusive process @xmath0 and exclusive channel @xmath1 in the context of the standard model .",
    "we attempt to probe kinematic regions in which asymmetries are sensitive to individual short - distance coefficients .",
    "thus measurements of these asymmetries provide tests of short - distance physics which is sensitive to extensions of the standard model . in this context",
    "it is suitable to consider the _ integral _ asymmetry as we have flexibility to make various phase space cuts and read off the corresponding ` partial integrated ' asymmetry .    the forward - backward asymmetry results from the interference of leptons produced by the vector current with that by the axial vector current ( see eq .  ( 10 ) )",
    "this is because it is a parity violating effect . in the @xmath16 ,",
    "the axial vector current is mainly due to the @xmath5 boson penguin and @xmath6 boson box diagrams in which top quarks are involved .",
    "the vector current arises not only from these two diagrams along with the photon penguin one , but also from loops containing instead charm quarks",
    ". extensions of the standard model lead to extra diagrams . in models with two higgs doubles , for example",
    ", there is a charged scalar particle .",
    "the charged scalar coupling to quarks can substitute @xmath6 boson in the @xmath5 boson penguin diagram .",
    "in addition to these , resonances such as the @xmath19 and @xmath20 , created by the neutral four - quark operator @xmath21 , contribute to the vector current via the @xmath22 .",
    "as shown later on , different sources of the vector current manifest themselves in different regions of phase space , whereas the axial vector current is constant overall .",
    "for the very low @xmath23 the photonic penguin dominates , while the @xmath5 pengiun and @xmath6 box becomes important towards high @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we shall demonstrate in this work that the short - distance component of the vector current suffers from cancellation dramatically in the middle @xmath23 region .",
    "actually , the pure top quarks effect vanishes at an invariant mass close to the @xmath19 mass and the analogy can be made with nonresonant contributions near the @xmath20 .",
    "thus the asymmetry over there , roughly speaking , contains to two factors ; one is from top quarks responsible for the axial vector current , and another is from charm quarks for the vector current .",
    "the former is short - distance and sensitive to new physics , while the latter , we believe , remains unchanged in extensions of the standard model .",
    "as it is not renormalized under qcd , the effective axial vector vertex can be calculated reliably . on the other hand , calculations show that the wilson coefficient of the @xmath21 operator , denoted by @xmath24 , is sensitive to the qcd scale parameter and the renormalization point and scheme beyond the leading logarithmic approximation  @xcite .",
    "but it is hopeful phenomenologically to extract this coefficient quite precisely from nonleptonic @xmath2 decays . with the top mass from the fermilab and the value of @xmath24 determined by the data of the @xmath25 ,",
    "the standard model prediction for forward - backward asymmetry of the middle region is insensitive to the dependence on the qcd renormalization parameters .",
    "meanwhile , measurements of the asymmetry offer us an opportunity to detect the axial current in the @xmath16 and to set constraints on extensions of the standard model .",
    "we suggest therefore that one should home in on the resonant region for revealing the effect of the axial vector current and short - distance physics in general .",
    "this is contrast to the decay rate spectrum where one has to ` cut out ' @xmath19 and @xmath20 resonances to probe the short - distance effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will briefly review the effective hamiltonian for the flavor - changing neutral - current - induced transition @xmath16 in the following section .",
    "then we proceed into the analysis of forward - backward asymmetry of the inclusive process @xmath26 in sec .",
    "the exclusive channel @xmath27 is also examined in the section , by employing heavy quark symmetry to determine form factors from measurements of semileptonic @xmath28 decays .",
    "iv is devoted to relevant discussions along with our conclusion .",
    "an appendix contains some useful integral formulae occurred in the main text .",

    "likewise , the dilepton decay @xmath0 provides a unique test of the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath2 which are absent in the radiative process .",
    "in addition to the top quark , the decay @xmath52 involves the charm quark and as well known , its total rate is actually dominated by the @xmath53 resonances . the contribution of these resonances such as @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the effective hamiltonian eq .",

    "the choice of a negative @xmath24 is in consistence with breit - wigner phase @xmath64 @xcite .",

    "the scheme independence of the sum of these coefficients has been explicitly demonstrated by the authors of ref .",
    "the differential forward - backward asymmetry of the @xmath15 production that we are to compute is defined by @xmath74 in which @xmath75 is the polar angle of the @xmath15 with respect to the direction of motion of the decaying meson in the @xmath73 frame . for the inclusive process",

    "we have checked that there is a variation of the zero point of short - distance effects due to the choice of form factors . with the same @xmath7 and @xmath106 as before ,",
    "there are @xmath204 ( the top quark effect alone ) and @xmath205 ( the short - distance effect as a whole ) for the monopole scheme , as well as @xmath206 and @xmath207 for the dipole one .",
    "the contribution of @xmath19 along with the @xmath53 effect still dominates its resonant region . by comparison , we find the two schemes of form factors give similar results of the integrated asymmetry above the @xmath20 .",
    "this is expected when both schemes use the data of semileptonic @xmath28 decays as input .",
    "but asymmetries , integrated over the interval between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the region below the @xmath19 with the monopole form , are @xmath208 times as large as that with the dipole one .",
    "this factor becomes even larger when @xmath23 is near to the origin .",
    "for the monopole form , a fraction of @xmath209 or so of the asymmetry occurs in the ground state and this is far from saturating the inclusive process .",
    "so it is anticipated that higher @xmath210-resonances may play an important role in measuring asymmetry as well .",
    "as we have seen in fig .  1 , the magnetic - moment operator becomes important for photons approaching the mass - shell .",
    "the positive asymmetry arising from it is the consequence of the coefficient @xmath50 being negative relative to @xmath41 in the standard model .",
    "thus measurement in this region will tell us the sign of @xmath50 , as well as confirming its bound given by the decay @xmath211 .    on the other hand , the relative phase between @xmath50 and @xmath212 impacts dramatically on the @xmath213 .",
    "for example , a potential magnetic - moment operator of a similar size but opposite sign to that in the standard model , such as those allowed in supersymmetry models @xcite , may increase the forward - backward asymmetry of the whole kinematical region by a factor of @xmath214 and a factor 2.0 for that in the low @xmath164 region with a cut - off at @xmath215 , but reversing the sign of the asymmetry .",
    "in fact , if this relative phase is negative it shows us evidence of new physics , whereas if it is positive it leads to the sensitivity of the asymmetry with respect to the @xmath19 and the @xmath53 continuum in the middle region .",
    "we emphasize that the relative phase between @xmath50 and @xmath212 manifests itself as well in the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons .",
    "when left - handed leptons do not mix up with right - handed ones in the massless lepton limit , the only interference occurs between quarks outgoing from the four - fermion vertex and that from the penguin , yielding a term proportional to @xmath216 $ ] in the dilepton spectrum .",
    "as it is likely that the first experiment will be carried out for this spectrum , we will be able to see whether there is cancellation between the top quark components of the asymmetry in a model independent way .    toward high @xmath23 ,",
    "coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 become important as they are enhanced by an extra @xmath23 .",
    "the contributions of @xmath5 boson penguin along with @xmath6 box diagrams in this region surpass that of the photonic penguin diagram for a large top quark mass such as @xmath217  gev ( see eq .",
    "while @xmath41 ( and @xmath50 ) may be determined by the method described before , this asymmetry will help to extract the value of the combination @xmath212 experimentally .",
    "when @xmath38 always occurs in combinations with the much larger @xmath37 , any appreciable difference between @xmath212 and @xmath96 is beyond the standard model .    as for the exclusive decay @xmath1 ,",
    "the difference between the two assumptions about form factors becomes evident for low @xmath164 . when applied to the rare radiative decay @xmath4 , the monopole form factors give a theoretical value of @xmath218 for the ratio of the exclusive to inclusive rate , defined as @xmath219 this is favored by the preliminary cleo data@xcite , while the dipole scheme result of @xmath220 is not .",
    "although these two sets of form factors are similar to each other near the endpoint , we tend to favor the prediction for charge asymmetries obtained by using the monopole scheme , as far as the whole kinematical region is concerned .",
    "finally we want to point out that possible experimental cuts in the invariant mass of lepton - antilepton pairs do not necessarily mean loss of statistics as far as asymmetry is concerned .",
    "for instance , a cut - off at the @xmath19 mass from which we integrate to the endpoint @xmath221 leads to an asymmetry larger in magnitude than that over the whole kinematical region .",
    "in fact , this interval gives the maxinum integrated asymmtry because of the resonant enhancement .",
    "our prediction for it , using @xmath48  gev , is @xmath222 in the inclusive process , which is accessible in the upcoming @xmath2 factories .    in conclusion",
    "we have presented a comprehensive analysis of forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath15 production in the decay @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have attempted to specify certain regions in phase space of the @xmath2 decay in which the asymmetry is sensitive to individual short - distance coefficients . in particular",
    ", we note the potential importance of the @xmath19 , since the integrated asymmetry near its resonant region is largely independent of the qcd renormalization .",
    "given the strong dependence of @xmath41 on the top quark mass , measurements of this asymmetry will not only provide an effective test of the standard model but also lead to information about @xmath7 .",
    "as well , we believe that the shape of the plots in figs . 1 to 4 represent well the expectation for the forward - backward asymmetry in the framework of the standard model .",
    "therefore if future experiments observe any dramatic deviation from them , they can be regarded as the evidence of new physics beyond the standard model .",

    "he is also grateful to the australian research council for their financial support , under grant number a69231484 .",
