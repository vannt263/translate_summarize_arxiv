    "the experimental measurement and theoretical investigation of dilepton production constitute one of the most active and exciting fields in the physics of relativistic nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "because of their relatively weak final - state interactions with the hadronic environment , dileptons , as well as photons , are considered ideal probes of the early stage of heavy - ion collisions , where quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) formation is expected @xcite .",
    "because of an additional variable , the invariant mass @xmath7 , dileptons have the advantage of a better signal to background ratio than real photons @xcite .",
    "they of course also prove superior in processes involving two - body annihilations .",
    "dilepton mass spectra produced in heavy ion collisions can basically be divided into three regions .",
    "the low - mass region below @xmath8 ( @xmath9 1 gev ) is dominated by hadronic interactions and hadronic decays . in the intermediate - mass region between @xmath8 and",
    "about 2.5 gev , the contribution from the thermalized qgp might be seen @xcite . in the high - mass region at and above @xmath10",
    "the major effort in heavy ion experiments has been the detection and understanding of @xmath11 suppression .",
    "so far , the experimental measurement of dilepton spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions has mainly been carried out at the cern sps by three collaborations : the ceres collaboration is dedicated to dielectron measurements in the low - mass region @xcite , the helios-3 @xcite collaboration has measured dimuon spectra from threshold up to the @xmath11 region , and the na38/na50 @xcite collaboration measures dimuon spectra in the intermediate- and high - mass regions , emphasizing @xmath11 suppression ( for a summary of low- and intermediate - mass dilepton measurements see refs .",
    "in addition , dilepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions at energies of a few gev / nucleon were measured by the dls collaboration @xcite . in the near future",
    ", dilepton spectra will be measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite at rhic , and by the hades collaboration at the gsi @xcite .",
    "recent observation of the enhancement of low - mass dileptons in central heavy - ion collisions by the ceres @xcite and the helios-3 @xcite collaborations has generated a great deal of theoretical activity .",
    "different models have been used to interpret these data .",
    "the results from many groups with standard scenarios ( i.e. , using vacuum meson properties ) are in remarkable agreement with each other , but in significant disagreement with the data : the experimental spectra in the mass region from 0.3 - 0.6 gev are substantially underestimated @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "this has led to the suggestion of various medium effects that might be responsible for the observed enhancement . in particular , the dropping vector meson mass scenario @xcite is found to provide a unified description of both the ceres and helios-3 data .",
    "however , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the high - mass region around @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath11 suppression has been a subject of great interest , since it was first proposed as a signal of the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "various investigations show that up to central s+au collisions , the normal pre - resonance absorption in nuclear matter can account for the observed @xmath11 suppression @xcite .",
    "however , recent data from the na50 collaboration for central pb+pb collisions show an additional strong ` anomalous ' suppression which might indicate the onset of the color deconfinement @xcite .    other interesting experimental data that have not yet received much theoretical attention are dilepton spectra in the intermediate - mass region from about 1 gev to about 2.5 gev .",
    "both the helios-3 and na38/na50 collaborations have observed significant enhancement of dilepton yield in this mass region in central s+w and s+u collisions as compared to that in proton - induced reactions ( normalized to the charged - particle multiplicity ) @xcite .",
    "preliminary data from the na50 collaboration also show significant enhancement in central pb+pb collisions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for dilepton spectra with mass above 1 gev , the contributions from charm meson decay and the initial drell - yan processes begin to play a role .",
    "these hard processes scale almost linearly with the participant nucleon number , and can therefore be extrapolated from proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions . such a study has recently been carried out by braun - munzinger _ et al _ @xcite . the results for p+w and central s+w collisions corresponding to the helios-3 acceptance are shown in fig .",
    "[ pw ] , and are taken from ref .",
    "these , together with the dileptons from the decay of primary vector mesons , are collectively termed ` background ' in this work .",
    "it is seen that this background describes very well the dimuon spectra in p+w reactions , shown in the figure by solid circles .",
    "however , as can be from the figure , the sum of these background sources grossly underestimates the dimuon yield in central s+w collisions , shown in the figure by open circles . since the dimuon spectra are normalized by the measured charged particle multiplicity , this underestimation indicates additional sources to dilepton production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "there are at least three possible sources for this enhancement : the additional production of charmed mesons and/or drell - yan pairs , a qgp formed in the collisions , and secondary hadronic interactions . while all these possibilities are of interest , and may actually coexist , in this work we concentrate on the contributions from the secondary hadronic interactions , which we believe need to be quantitatively assessed . in this work we limit ourselves to meson interactions .",
    "however we will also comment on the role of baryons later .",
    "for dilepton spectra at low invariant masses , it is well known that the @xmath12 annihilation plays an extremely important role in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is also expected that other secondary processes will play a role in the dilepton spectra in the intermediate mass region , and we attempt to demonstrate this in a realistic calculation that compares with experimental data .",
    "this will be done with the relativistic transport model used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of low - mass dilepton and photon production .",
    "the main motivation for such a study is to understand the origin of the observed enhancement in the intermediate - mass region , and to see whether the data calls for the formation of a qgp phase .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the elementary dilepton production cross sections that are needed as inputs in the transport model .",
    "we shall emphasize the constraints imposed on these cross sections by the experimental data for the reverse process of @xmath6 . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the thermal dilepton emission rates from the hadronic interactions , and compare our results with those from other approaches .",
    "the elementary cross sections , as constrainted by the @xmath13 annihilation data , are then used in the transport model to calculate dilepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions at sps energies .",
    "the results will be presented in section 4 .",
    "the paper ends with a brief summary and outlook in section 5 .",
    "in the low - mass region from 2@xmath14 to @xmath15 , it has been shown that @xmath16 annihilation , which is characteristic of heavy - ion collisions , plays an important role in explaining the observed enhancement .",
    "similarly , it is expected that other secondary hadronic processes should also play some role in the intermediate - mass region .",
    "indeed , previous thermal rate calculations based on kinetic theory show that in the mass and temperature regions relevant for this study , the following processes ( from the hadronic phase ) are important : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 @xcite . among these processes , @xmath2 has been found to be the most important one , mainly because of its large cross section @xcite ( similar conclusions have been drawn for thermal photon production @xcite ) .",
    "note here that we discuss only two - body reactions , as they should dominate the phase space region we are considering .",
    "an important input in the transport model calculation of dilepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions is the elementary dilepton production cross sections for the processes outlined above . in next three subsections",
    ", we will discuss the cross sections and form factors for pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar , pseudoscalar - vector , and pseudoscalar - axial vector meson annihilation .",
    "in this class we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 annihilation . in the vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) , the feynman diagram for this process is quite simple and is shown in fig .",

    "we use a standard lagrangian for the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector interaction , @xmath23    the obtained dilepton production cross section in pion - pion annihilation is well known @xcite to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnitude of the three - momentum of the pion in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath26 is the mass of the lepton pair , and @xmath27 is the mass of the lepton .",
    "it is well known that the electromagnetic form factors @xmath28 play important role in this process , providing empirical support for vmd : the pion electromagnetic form factor is dominated by the @xmath29 meson . in addition , at large invariant masses , higher @xmath30-like resonances such as @xmath31 were found to be important @xcite .",

    "the agreement between the model and the experimental data is excellent .",
    "this assures us that the elementary dilepton production cross section in pion - pion annihilation used in our transport model is well under control .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor has been parameterized in different ways .",

    "it however underestimates the data at larger invariant masses , since it neglects the role of higher @xmath30-like resonances .",
    "the dilepton production cross section in kaon - antikaon annihilation is very similar , @xmath38 where @xmath25 is the magnitude of the kaon momentum in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the cross section for the reverse process of electron - positron annihilation can again be obtained from the detailed - balance relation , @xmath39 in these equations , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electromagnetic form factors of charged and neutral kaons , respectively . these form factor",

    "the neutral kaon form factor follows from general arguments @xcite . the direct comparison with the experimental charged kaon cross section is shown in fig . [ kkxsect ]",
    "again , very good agreement between the model and the data is seen .      in this class",

    "the first two processes effectively involve three pions , while the third one involves four pions . in transport models a process involving three or more pions in the initial state",

    ", we have used as initial conditions the hadron abundances and distributions obtained from string fragmentation .",
    "further interactions and decays of these hadrons are then taken into account as in most relativistic transport models .",
    "this approach is found to provide a good description of hadronic observables ( such as transverse mass spectra and rapidity distributions ) in heavy - ion collisions at cern sps energies @xcite .",
    "we should make here some comments on the treatment of resonances and multi - particle interactions in the transport model .",
    "the narrow - width approximation was not used in our calculation .",
    "the mass distribution of the resonances ( for example the @xmath107 ) in our approach is taken into account .",
    "note that this realistic sampling of the spectral function is different from usual kinetic theory estimates of the dilepton emission rates where the resonance is usually given a fixed mass .",
    "furthermore , in our transport model , the fact that the resonance has a finite life time is fully respected : its population is evolved dynamically . the resonance is formed in collisions and also eventually decays . in the early stage of the heavy - ion collision ,",
    "resonance formation is favored since the density is high .",
    "as the system expands and the density gets smaller , the resonance decay process gradually becomes dominant .",
    "this is again different from kinetic theory calculations .",
    "let s take @xmath138 as a concrete example . in our approach ,",
    "a rho meson is first made from two - pions colliding .",
    "it then interacts with a third pion to form an @xmath107 meson .",
    "finally this @xmath107 meson annihilates a fourth pion to produce a lepton pair .",
    "the explicit treatment of intermediate resonances takes care of the formation time typical of strong interaction , which is very important for heavy - ion collisions at sps energies .",
    "furthermore , this algorithm also includes the possibility that in the course of the multi - step process the intermediate rho or @xmath107 meson might interact with other particles , say a nucleon , rather than with the third or the fourth pion .",
    "this amounts to a dynamical generation of a broadened width . finally , for any reasonable comparison with experimental data from heavy - ion collisions , a transport model that describes the dynamic evolution of the colliding system is a required tool .",
    "the contributions from the secondary processes outlined above are shown in fig .",
    "[ swthml ] .",
    "these are obtained in our relativistic transport model @xcite , including the helios-3 acceptances , mass resolution , and normalization @xcite . here",
    "@xmath139 represents number of dimuon pairs within the 50 mev mass bin , normalized by the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath80 process is by far the most important source for dimuon yields in this mass region .",
    "the @xmath105 process also plays some role in the entire intermediate - mass region , while the contributions from @xmath12 , @xmath46 and @xmath103 are important around 1 gev invariant mass the relative importance of various processes follow basically the thermal rate predictions , as discussed in the previous section .    in fig .",
    "[ swtot ] , we add the secondary contributions obtained in our transport model to the background , and compare again with the helios-3 data for central s+w collisions .",
    "it is seen that the data can be adequately reproduced .",
    "this highlights for the first time the importance of the secondary processes for the intermediate - mass dilepton spectra in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this is an important step forward in the use of intermediate - mass dilepton spectra as a probe of the phase transition and qgp formation .",
    "although the current data do not show any necessity to invoke the qgp formation in s - induced reactions , consistent with some conclusions from @xmath11 physics , we believe that the observation that the secondary processes do play a significant role in the intermediate - mass dilepton spectra is interesting and important . we note in passing that the change of slope observed in the experimental data corresponds in our interpretation to a crossover between the secondary processes and the ( drell - yan / charm ) background .",
    "this represents a transition from soft to hard physics and this observation should be explored further in the future .",
    "the results shown in figs .",
    "[ swthml ] and [ swtot ] are obtained under the assumption that all the 4@xmath106 final state in the @xmath13 cross section proceeds through the @xmath80 intermediate state .",
    "we also did a calculation in which the @xmath80 form factor contains only the normal @xmath29 .",
    "the results are shown in fig . [ swfm ] by the dotted curve . finally , to complete our survey of possible constraints and uncertainties in @xmath140",
    "cross sections , we did a calculation in which this cross section is obtained from the @xmath141 cross section determined by the dm2 collaboration in partial wave analysis ( pwa ) @xcite ( see fig . [ eepia1dm2 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "the region between the solid and dashed curves thus reflect the uncertainty for heavy - ion collisions due to our limited knowledge of the @xmath80 cross section .",
    "this area is not unreasonably large . from a formal point of view , it is fair to say that no strong evidence currently exists coupling the @xmath70 to a @xmath80 state @xcite , even though better 4@xmath106 data could help resolve this issue along with others of interference and @xmath142 contribution . note that the fact that the dm2 results are lower than in other scenarios at high invariant masses is concealed by the hard background .    also shown in this figure is the results of ref .",
    "@xcite which uses the dilepton emission rate obtained in the chiral reduction formalism with a simple fireball model for the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is see that their results are also in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "another issue we want to address here is the effects of dropping vector meson masses on the entire dimuon spectra from the threshold to about 2.5 gev . in ref . @xcite it was shown that the enhancement of low - mass dileptons could be interpreted as a signature of vector meson masses decreasing with increasing density and temperature",
    ". this should affect the dilepton spectra in the intermediate - mass region , mainly through two effects .",
    "one is the change of the invariant energy spectra of these secondary meson pairs .",
    "the second effect enters through the modification of the electromagnetic form factor . since we can only conjecture how the masses of the higher vector resonances change with density and temperature",
    ", we shall assume for simplicity that they experience the same amount of scalar field as the `` common '' rho meson , namely , @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ swmass ] . below 1.1 gev and especially from 0.4 to 0.6 gev , the agreement with the experimental data is much better when the dropping vector meson mass scenario is introduced , as was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . at higher masses ,",
    "the dropping mass scenarios somewhat underestimates the experimental data .",
    "also note that our starting point was our first scenario . for completeness",
    ", however , we have to state that there might be additional contributions from , e.g. , secondary drell - yan processes @xcite that were not included in this study .",
    "there could also be enhanced production of charmed mesons .",
    "furthermore , as we progress higher in invariant mass , the role of baryons has to be carefully assessed .",
    "so far , the baryons seem to play little role in the overall dilepton yield @xcite .",
    "this statement was examined in ref .",
    "@xcite for masses below 1 gev , which is being extended to the intermediate - mass region in @xcite .",
    "see however ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternate discussion on the role of baryons .",
    "in summary , we have carried out a study of intermediate - mass ( between 1 and 2.5 gev ) dilepton spectra from hadronic interactions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the processes included are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we calculated the elementary cross sections for these processes based on chiral hadronic lagrangians for pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons .",
    "the corresponding electromagnetic form factors are determined by fitting to the experimental data for the reverse processes of @xmath6 . while the form factors for @xmath12 , @xmath103 , @xmath46 , @xmath105 , and @xmath104 are uniquely constrained by the @xmath13 data , there are still uncertainties in the @xmath80 form factor , for which we have considered three scenarios .",
    "we used these cross sections with kinetic theory to calculate the dilepton emission rates at finite temperature .",
    "the @xmath2 process was found to be the most important one in the intermediate - mass region , as was found in previous calculations .",
    "our rates were compared with those from other approaches .",
    "this provides us with the confidence that we have some control of the dilepton spectra from the secondaries hadronic interaction .",
    "this is important for the use of the dilepton spectra as a probe of phase transition and qgp properties .",
    "finally we apply these elementary cross sections in a relativistic transport model and calculate dilepton spectra in s+w collisions at sps energies .",
    "again , the @xmath2 was found to be the most important process .",
    "the comparison of our results with experimental data from the helios-3 collaboration indicates the importance of the secondary hadronic contributions to the intermediate - mass dilepton spectra .",
    "this work can be extended in several directions .",
    "although the current experimental data from the helios-3 collaboration are not very sensitive to the different assumptions of the @xmath80 form factor , it would be very useful to pin this down since the @xmath80 is the single most important source of the intermediate - mass dileptons from hadronic secondary collisions .",
    "also , a more elaborate calculation of the charmed meson production and initial ( as well as possible secondary ) drell - yan contributions in heavy - ion collisions is needed .",
    "such a calculation could put the conclusions reached in this work concerning the role of secondary hadronic processes and dropping vector meson masses on an even firmer footing .",
    "finally , the current investigation can be extended to higher incident energies , such as those of the rhic collider , by combining the cross sections ( or thermal rates ) obtained in this study with , e.g. , hydrodynamical models for the evolution of heavy - ion collisions at the rhic energies .",
    "this kind of study is useful for the determination of hadronic sources in the dilepton spectra to be measured by the phenix collaboration , and thus for the clear identification of the dilepton yield arising from the qgp .",
