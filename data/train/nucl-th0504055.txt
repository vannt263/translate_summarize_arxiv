    "elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions is a measure of the azimuthal angular anisotropy of particle distribution in momentum space with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the eeliptic flow depends on both initial spatial asymmetry in non - central collisions and the subsequent collective interactions .",
    "the elliptic flow is thus sensitive to the properties of the dense matter formed during the initial stage of heavy ion collision @xcite and parton dynamics @xcite at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "experimentally , elliptic flow has been measured as functions of collision centrality , transverse momentum , ( pesudo)rapidity and particle species @xcite in @xmath5au + @xmath5au collisions from rhic at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "the experimental results of charged kaon , proton and pion @xcite show that the elliptic flow first increases with particle transverse momentum following the hydrodynamic behavior and then reaches a saturation in intermediate transverse momentum region .",
    "more importantly , a number - of - constituent - quark ( ncq ) scaling has been discovered for identified particle elliptic flow in the intermediate @xmath3 region for baryons and mesons .",
    "the data of pion elliptic flow @xmath4 are somewhat higher than the ncq scaling , which can be attributed to the large contribution to the pion yield from secondary decays  @xcite .",
    "the ncq scaling at rhic is an important indication for the effective constituent quark degree of freedom at hadronization and the formation of hadrons through parton coalescence mechanism  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a number - of - nucleon scaling for anisotropic flow of light nuclear clusters in nuclear collisions at fermi energies was recently demonstrated by ma et al .",
    "@xcite , which is interpreted as a consequence of nucleon coalescence mechanism .",
    "strange quark dynamics is a useful probe of the dense matter created at rhic .",
    "enhanced strangeness production @xcite has been proposed as an important signal for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in nuclear collisions .",
    "the dominant production of @xmath6 pairs via gluon - gluon interaction may lead to a strangeness ( chemical and flavor ) equilibration time comparable to the lifetime of the qgp whereas the strangeness equilibration time in a hadronic fireball is much longer than the lifetime of the hadronic fireball .",
    "the subsequent hadronization of the qgp is then expected to result in an enhanced production of strange particles . in particular",
    ", it has been argued that with the formation of qgp the production of @xmath1 mesons is enhanced .",
    "furthermore @xmath1 mesons could retain the information on the condition of the hot plasma at hadronization because @xmath1 mesons interact weakly in the hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 mesons has been of great interest in the study of collision dynamics and the properties of the dense matter created at rhic  @xcite .",
    "we use a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model to investigate effect of parton dynamics related to @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the ampt consists of four main components  @xcite : initial conditions , partonic interactions , conversion from partonic matter into hadronic matter and hadronic interactions in collision evolution .",
    "the initial conditions , which include the spatial distribution of participant matter , minijet partons production and soft string excitations , are obtained from the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "scattering among partons are modelled by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) @xcite , which calculates two - body parton scatterings using cross sections from pqcd with screening masses . in the default ampt model",
    "@xcite partons are recombined with their parent strings when they stop interacting , and the resulting strings fragment into hadrons according to the lund string fragmentation model @xcite . in the ampt model with string melting scenario @xcite , a quark coalescence model is used to combine parton into hadrons .",
    "the evolution dynamics of the hadronic matter is described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model @xcite .",
    "details of the ampt model can be found in @xcite .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of the elliptic flow of @xmath1 mesons at the top rhic energy based on the ampt model with the string melting scenario @xcite .",
    "the string melting scenario is believed to be much more appropriate than the default ampt scenario since the energy density in these collisions is much higher than the critical density for the qcd phase transition . the ampt model with string melting scenario",
    "has successfully described the elliptic flow of stable baryons and mesons @xcite .",
    "it can also describe higher - order anisotropic flow parameters @xmath7 including the odd - n ones @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we follow the method used in experimental analysis by reconstructing @xmath1 mesons in the final state from fitting the invariance mass distribution of all @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs with a breit - wigner function including the intrinsic decay width of @xmath1 mesons @xcite .",
    "the parton scattering cross section is chosen as 10 mb . the transverse momentum and collision centrality dependences of @xmath1 meson @xmath0",
    "have been studied and the ncq - scaling has also been observed in the ampt model . in addition , the rescattering effect on @xmath1 meson @xmath0 has been investigated in the hadronic phase using the art model where rescattering processes of @xmath1 mesons and their decay daughters are included @xcite .",

    "this event plane resolution is determined by dividing each event into random sub - events and calculating the difference in event plane angles between sub - events .",
    "we obtained an event plane resolution of 0.91 , which is @xmath24 larger than the experimental resolution reported by star @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of tracks per event used in our simulation is larger than that from the data . in order to verify our resolution correction ,",

    "this may result from the large parton scattering cross section ( 10 mb ) used in this monte carlo ampt calculation . in order to explore the intermediate @xmath3 ( 1.5@xmath344.0 gev/@xmath12 ) phenomenon , where the so - called ncq - scaling in elliptic flow for identified particles has been observed at rhic @xcite and",
