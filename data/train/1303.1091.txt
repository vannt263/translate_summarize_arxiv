    "this paper is a sequel of @xcite in which we introduced a new model to describe biological invasions in the plane when a strong diffusion takes place on a line .",
    "the purpose of this model is to understand the effect of a line interacting with a homogeneous environment .",
    "this type of questions arises for instance in studying the propagation of diseases directed by roads @xcite or the movements of animal populations in the presence of pathways allowing for a more rapid movement .",
    "an example of the latter is provided by recent observations of movements of wolves along seismic lines in western canada @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we derived the asymptotic speed of spreading in the direction of the line .",
    "there we showed that for low diffusion the line has no effect , whereas , past a threshold , the line enhances global diffusion in the plane in the direction of the line .",
    "moreover , the propagation velocity on the line increases indefinitely as the diffusivity on the line grows to infinity .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to include new features in this model such as transport and reaction or mortality on the road and to understand the resulting new effects .",
    "taking into account these new elements is important when discussing propagation directed by roads or along water stream networks .",
    "these require new developments that turn out to make more transparent the case considered in @xcite as well .",
    "consider the line @xmath0 in the plane @xmath1 ; we will refer to the plane as  the field \" and the line as  the road \" . for a single species",
    ", we consider a system that combines the density of this population in the field @xmath2 and the density on the line @xmath3 .",
    "the main questions that we want to understand are the effects of a transport term @xmath4 as well as a decay rate @xmath5 on the road .",
    "an invasive species that can be carried by streams of water is an example of a situation where such additional terms are required .",
    "the transport and the decay rate are considered here to be uniform , that is , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constant . due to the symmetry of the problem ,",
    "we can restrict our analysis to the upper half - plane @xmath8 .",
    "the equations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 then read : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfies the usual kpp type assumptions : @xmath16 note that transport and pure decay only occur on the road and the question is to know how these interact with the diffusivity and growth in the field .",
    "we combine the system with the initial condition @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are always assumed to be nonnegative and continuous .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the classical kpp invasion speed @xcite in the field : @xmath21 this is the asymptotic speed at which the population would spread in the open space - i.e. , when no line is present ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we say that admits the _",
    "asymptotic speeds of spreading _",
    "@xmath22 ( in the directions @xmath23 ) if for any solution @xmath24 starting from a compactly supported initial datum @xmath25 , and for all @xmath26 , the following hold true : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unique positive , bounded , stationary solution of .    thus , the first step for proving the existence of the asymptotic speeds of spreading consists in deriving a uniqueness result for the stationary system .",
    "we call it a liouville - type result",
    ". the existence of the asymptotic speeds of spreading implies in particular that @xmath29,\\quad   \\lim_{t\\to+\\infty}(u(x+ct , t),v(x+ct , y , t))=(0,0),\\ ] ] @xmath30 locally uniformly in @xmath31 .",
    "this kind of weaker formulation is sometimes used in the literature as the definition of the asymptotic speed .      in @xcite",
    ", we proved that , in the case @xmath32 , admits asymptotic speeds of spreading @xmath22 .",
    "we further identified a threshold situation : @xmath33 below which @xmath34 and above which @xmath35 .",
    "the first question we address in the present paper is how this threshold is modified by the presence of the transport and decay terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this question is solved by the following    [ thm : rho ] under the assumption , problem admits asymptotic speeds of spreading @xmath22 ( in the directions @xmath36 ) . moreover , if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 , else @xmath39 .    in the case",
    "@xmath40 , we recover the result of @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : rho ] shows that a mortality term @xmath41 always rises the threshold for @xmath42 after which the effect of the road is felt .",
    "the threshold for the enhancement of the speed towards right , @xmath43 , is decreased if the transport term @xmath6 is positive and increased if it is negative .",
    "+ we will actually carry out the whole study of system in the case where the mortality term @xmath44 is replaced by a more general reaction term @xmath45 .",
    "this term can be used to model situations where reproduction occurs on the road as well .",
    "the general system reads @xmath46 the hypotheses are : @xmath47 and satisfy @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 condition holds if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are concave .",
    "it implies that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are of kpp type : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "[ thm : main ] assume that - hold . then :    a.   _ ( liouville - type result ) . _ problem admits a unique , positive , bounded , stationary solution @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . b.   _ ( spreading ) .",
    "_ problem admits asymptotic speeds of spreading @xmath22 . c.   _ ( spreading velocity ) . _ if @xmath58 , then @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise @xmath39 .",
    "notice that , in theorem [ thm : rho ] , @xmath59 is not assumed to be nonincreasing .",
    "this hypothesis is only required in the proof of statement ( i ) of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is given in proposition [ pro : liouville2 ] below .",
    "it is to be noted that the liouville - type result may fail if @xmath59 is not nonincreasing . in this case",
    ", we still get a convergence result , but for initial data satisfying @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the convergence holds to the minimal positive , stationary solution ( see remark [ rem : noliouville ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the spreading speeds are still well defined and statements ( ii ) and ( iii ) of theorem [ thm : main ] hold true . when there is no transport on the road , @xmath62 and @xmath63 coincide and the threshold condition given by theorem  [ thm : rho ] part ( iii ) becomes @xmath64 this allows us to understand the - somewhat mysterious - factor 2 in the threshold condition of @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath65 , we recover the condition @xmath66 of @xcite .",
    "we further note that , if @xmath67 , the threshold condition becomes @xmath68 - which is what one would have expected .",
    "thus , when the same reaction occurs on the road and in the field , the effect of the road is felt as soon as the diffusivity there is larger than in the field .",
    "the factor @xmath69 of @xcite is therefore explained by the absence of reaction on the road .",
    "+ in the last part of the paper , we investigate the limits of the asymptotic speeds of spreading @xmath22 as the diffusion and the transport on the road tend to @xmath70 .",
    "we find the following asymptotic behaviours :    [ thm : limits ] as functions of the variables @xmath71 and @xmath6 respectively , @xmath22 satisfy @xmath72 with @xmath73 independent of @xmath6 and @xmath74 independent of @xmath71 .    the expression of @xmath75 is explicitly given in the proof of the theorem in section [ sec : largeq ] .",
    "what we are aiming at understanding here is how transport , diffusivity and reaction on the road combine to yield a spreading speed larger than @xmath20 , the kpp invasion speed in the open field ( without the road ) . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider propagation to the right ( that is , in the direction @xmath76 ) .    in the case when the reaction on the road consists in a pure mortality term @xmath44 , theorem [ thm : rho ]",
    "asserts that the threshold for @xmath42 after which the effect of the road is felt grows linearly in @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the larger the @xmath7 , the more likely the road has no effect on the overall propagation .",
    "when @xmath77 , the threshold condition reads @xmath78 the above formula can also be written as @xmath79 a consequence of this formula is that a transport @xmath6 larger than @xmath20 is sufficient to enhance the overall propagation , no matter what the diffusivity ratio is .",
    "this explains for instance how a river may help the invasion of a parasite @xcite .",
    "it may seem at first sight a natural effect that a drift term larger than @xmath20 on the road will enhance the overal invasion speed and bring it above @xmath80 .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the situation we are looking at , on the road alone - without the exchange terms with the field - there would be extinction of the population even with a large @xmath6 .",
    "the global spreading speed results from a rather delicate interaction between the field and the road .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that the threshold is precisely @xmath81 . if @xmath82 then the spreading is with the usual kpp velocity",
    "this yields an interesting interpretation when considering the propagation against the direction of the transport , that is , when @xmath83 . for @xmath84 large enough ,",
    "the asymptotic speed of spreading in the direction @xmath76 in the field is the kpp invasion speed .",
    "for instance , asymptotic propagation upstream against a river flow in the neighbouring field is unaffected by the river , but downstream propagation , in the direction of the flow , can be significantly enhanced .",
    "theorem [ thm : limits ] asserts that the spreading speed approaches a portion of the speed @xmath6 of the flow when the latter is very large .",
    "this portion is equal to @xmath85 only if there is a sufficiently large reaction @xmath52 on the road .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the condition on @xmath52 only involves the rate @xmath86 at which the individuals leave the line .",
    "another phenomenon for which our model is relevant is the dynamics of a population that favours disturbed habitats .",
    "it is known that certain invasive plants , some weeds in particular , thrive in disturbed habitats , such as cultivated fields or along roads @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the presence of disturbances increases their speed of spreading @xcite .",
    "a model has been proposed in [ 2 ] to describe this type of phenomena and in particular the propagation of the `` unscented chamomile '' in north america .",
    "this is an invasive weed widely distributed in croplands , pastures and infrastructure ( road edges ) . in such cases ,",
    "the disturbance , represented by the road , provides better environmental conditions than the rest of the territory ( more diffuse light , bare ground that permit seedling establishment ) , rather than a greater diffusivity .",
    "this results in having @xmath87 and @xmath88 in our model .",
    "if one actually has @xmath89 then theorem [ thm : main ] implies that there is enhancement of the invasion speed , which is in agreement with the observations . notice that if @xmath90 then the enhancement always occurs , whatever the diffusivity ratio is .",
    "we plan to study the effect due to propagation through a road crossing a globally unfavourable area in a separate note .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we start with recalling the results of @xcite concerning the well - posedness of the cauchy problems and the comparison principles .",
    "then , we show that the large time limits of solutions emerging from non - trivial , bounded initial data are trapped between two positive , bounded , stationary solutions which do not depend on @xmath91 . in section [ sec : liouville ] , we derive the liouville - type results for such class of solutions , first for and then for .",
    "the large - time behaviour of solutions is thereby characterized , at least locally uniformly in space . in particular , theorem [ thm : main ] part ( i ) follows .    in section [ sec : velocity ] , we investigate the spreading property of solutions , that is , the set where they converge to @xmath92 or to the positive , stationary solution .",
    "we give the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] parts ( ii ) and ( iii ) insisting on the main differences with @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : limits ] is dedicated to the proof of theorem [ thm : limits ] .",
    "throughout this section , we assume that , hold . the unique solvability for the cauchy problem associated with in the class of nonnegative , bounded functions follows from the same arguments as in @xcite , proposition 3.1 . there",
    ", the case @xmath65 is treated , but a slight modification of the arguments allows one to handle the presence of the nonlinear term @xmath52 .",
    "the existence result is obtained by first solving the cauchy problem for @xmath9 with @xmath93 and then the one for @xmath10 with the so obtained @xmath9 .",
    "repeating this procedure , starting with the new @xmath10 , one constructs an increasing , bounded sequence @xmath94 which eventually converges to a solution of .",
    "the uniqueness result is a consequence of the comparison principle between sub and supersolutions ( i.e. , pairs of functions satisfying the system with the `` @xmath95 '' replaced by `` @xmath96 '' and `` @xmath97 '' respectively ) .",
