    "there is a serious question as to whether the specified gradients of rf cavities operating under vacuum would operate in the specified magnetic fields .",
    "this is under study by nfmcc collaboration  @xcite and alternative designs using high pressure hydrogen gas , or open cell rf with solenoids in the irises , are being considered .",
    "the bunching and phase rotation will be optimized for the muon collider , instead of being copied from a neutrino factory . instead of the slow helices",
    ", a planar wiggler lattice is being studied that would cool both muon signs simultaneously , thus greatly simplifying the system .",
    "the use of more , but lower field ( e.g. , 35  t ) final cooling solenoids is also under study .",
    "experiments are underway to demonstrate two of the new technologies : mercury target  @xcite , ionization cooling  @xcite .",
    "further experimental studies are needed .",
    "although much work remains to be done , the scenario outlined here appears to be a plausible solution to the problems of capturing , manipulating , and cooling muons to the specifications for muon colliders with useful luminosities and energies , even up to 8  tev in the center of mass .",

    "<S> a complete scheme for production , cooling , acceleration , and ring for a 1.5  tev center of mass muon collider is presented , together with parameters for two higher energy machines . </S>",
    "<S> the schemes starts with the front end of a proposed neutrino factory that yields bunch trains of both muon signs . </S>",
    "<S> six dimensional cooling in long - period helical lattices reduces the longitudinal emittance until it becomes possible to merge the trains into single bunches , one of each sign . </S>",
    "<S> further cooling in all dimensions is applied to the single bunches in further helical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> final transverse cooling to the required parameters is achieved in 50  t solenoids .    </S>",
    "<S> .5 in    .parameters of three muon colliders . </S>",
    "<S> note 1 : depth is relative to any nearby low land , e.g. fox river at fnal . </S>",
    "<S> note 2 : survival is from the end of phase rotation to the collider ring . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tuneshift ]    note that @xmath0 is larger at earlier cooling stages to allow for losses . </S>",
    "<S> the first order shifts can be corrected by increasing the focus strength , but tune spreads of half the shifts can not be corrected .    before the merge , </S>",
    "<S> the shifts are small because the numbers of muons per bunch are small . </S>",
    "<S> the only 6d cooling stage with significant tune shift is the last ( # 8) . </S>",
    "<S> its tune accepted @xmath1 which is 5 times the calculated maximum full tune spread of @xmath2 7.3% , and is not expected to be a problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the tune shifts in the 50  t cooling will be significant only during the reaccelerations , where we have assumed @xmath3s corresponding to 3  t focusing fields . </S>",
    "<S> the design of these lattices to accept such tune shifts appears possible , although we are clearly nearing the limit . </S>"
