    "the celebrated separation principle plays a key role in the linear theory of control .",
    "it states that the problem of designing an optimal stable feedback controller can be broken into two parts : designing an optimal stable observer meant to feed an optimal stable controller . as a particular application of this principle",
    "it is proved that for a _ linear time - invariant _ system , combining a stable observer and a stable controller yields a stable closed - loop system .    when the system is non - linear , the separation principle does not holds .",
    "however a local separation principle can always be stated around steady - states , as the linearized system around steady - states is linear and time - invariant .",
    "but in general it does not hold around other types of trajectories . in this paper",
    ", we consider invariant systems on lie groups , and we state a local separation principle around a large class of trajectories that are not necessarily steady - states .",
    "note that separation principles for special classes of non - linear systems have been addressed in e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "various systems of engineering interest can be modeled as invariant systems on lie groups , mainly cart - like vehicles and mechanical systems such as rigid bodies in space .",
    "there is an extensive literature on control on lie groups ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite as one of the pioneering papers ) , but general methods for observer design on lie groups have only been introduced recently ( @xcite ) . in this paper , a link is established between those two fields or reasearch and a separation principle on lie groups is stated .    in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the linear separation principle , and the local non - linear separation principle around steady states . in section 3",
    ", we consider a left - invariant system on a lie group and we build a symmetry - preserving observer .",
    "it has been proved that , for such observers there exists a large set of trajectories around which the estimation error is time - invariant : the so - called permanent trajectories ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we prove that the tracking error is also time - invariant when the reference trajectory is a permanent trajectory . as a result ,",
    "the _ linearized _ closed - loop observer - controler system is _ time - invariant _ around permanent trajectories .",
    "this implies a ( local ) separation principle around permanent trajectories .",
    "this result advocates that the recently introduced permanent trajectories for systems on lie groups generalize steady states for general non - linear systems . indeed ,",
    "if the observer is not a symmetry - preserving observer , the linearized closed - loop observer - controler system around permanent trajectories is time - varying ( in general ) , implying that a local separation principle does not hold .    in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the well - known problem of localizing from landmarks using sonar ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observability follows from triangulation , and position estimation is generally achieved via the widespread extended kalman filter ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for this system",
    "we derive a class of symmetry - preserving observers that converge around _ any _ permanent trajectories ( i.e. circles and lines with constant speed ) .",
    "the separation principle derived in this paper allows to prove that , as soon as the control scheme is stable around those trajectories , the closed - loop system is also stable around those trajectories and the eigenvalues of the closed - loop linearized system are those of the observer together with those of the controller .",
    "it is interesting to note that this stability result does not hold for an extended kalman filter .",
    "note that symmetry - preserving observers have already been used for localization from landmarks in @xcite .",
    "besides the two main contribution of this paper , which are to derive a ( local ) separation principle for invariant systems on lie groups , and to derive an observer - controler for the localization problem from landmarks with guaranteed convergence properties around a large set of trajectories , we consider in section 5 a ( very ) particular observation problem for simple mechanical systems on lie groups whose motion is described by euler - poincar equations .",
    "such systems have been extensively studied in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . by a similar token as the one of section 2 we prove a local separation principle around permanent trajectories .",
    "consider the system @xmath0 where @xmath1 belongs to an open subset @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to track the reference trajectory @xmath3 using only the measured output  @xmath4 .",
    "in other words we want to stabilize the equilibrium point @xmath5 of the error system @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "we are interested only in local stability , i.e. we want to stabilize the linearized error system @xmath10 the notation @xmath11 stands for the derivative with respect to the @xmath12 argument .",
    "notice the system  - as well as the matrices @xmath13 are in general not time - invariant unless the reference trajectory @xmath14 is an equilibrium point , i.e. is constant and such that @xmath15 .",
    "to stabilize the linearized system , one can use the linear controller - observer @xmath16 where the @xmath17 matrix  @xmath18 and @xmath19 matrix  @xmath20 are to be chosen .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath21 the closed - loop system @xmath22 has a triangular structure hence its eigenvalues are those of @xmath23 together with those of @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath14 is an equilibrium point , it can easily be stabilized by placing separately the eigenvalues of @xmath23 through  @xmath18 and those of @xmath24 through  @xmath20 ( provided of course @xmath25 is controllable and @xmath26 is observable ) .",
    "this is the well - known separation principle for linear time - invariant systems .",
    "the result still applies if the reference trajectory is slowly - varying , i.e. @xmath27 for all  @xmath28 ; @xmath18 and  @xmath20 may also depend on the reference trajectory to provide gain - scheduling .",
    "this shows that the control law @xmath29 where the input  @xmath30 and output  @xmath31 of  - are replaced by @xmath32 and  @xmath33 , locally stabilizes the equilibrium point @xmath5 of  . in other words",
    "@xmath34 stabilizes around the reference trajectory  - using only the measured output  .      instead of the linear observer of the previous section",
    ", the so - called `` extended '' observer @xmath35 can be used .",
    "the @xmath19 gain matrix @xmath20 may depend on  @xmath36 to provide gain - scheduling .",
    "we assume this observer converges , i.e. the origin of the error system @xmath37 is stable , where @xmath38 is the observation error .",
    "once again we are interested only in local stability , i.e. we assume only the stability of the linearized error system @xmath39 notice it is usually not easy to ensure even this local stability , unless the reference trajectory @xmath40 is an equilibrium point .",
    "in this case can be further linearized around @xmath40 , which yields  .",
    "the control law @xmath41 then locally stabilizes around the reference trajectory  - using only the measured output  .",
    "indeed , @xmath42 hence @xmath43 , so that the linearized closed - loop system @xmath44 is clearly stable .",
    "we again consider the system  - , but now @xmath45 is a lie group of dimension  @xmath46 with identity  @xmath47 and group law @xmath48    let @xmath49 be an open set ( or more generally a manifold ) .",

    "finally define the following `` products '' which provide very compact notations : for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the tangent space of @xmath45 at  @xmath56 ) @xmath68 invariance then reads @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we would like the invariant system  - to track the reference trajectory  - . instead of using as before the `` linear '' errors @xmath71 , @xmath72 and  @xmath73 , we consider the errors @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these errors are invariant in the sense that @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the error system is then given by @xmath80 and we want to stabilize its equilibrium point @xmath81 .",
    "we have used the important invariant quantity @xmath82 which leads to the following definition of a class of remarkable trajectories .",
    "the trajectory @xmath40 is _ permanent _ if @xmath83 is constant ( i.e. independent of time ) .",
    "once again we are interested only in local stability , i.e. we want to stabilize only the linearization of  - around  @xmath81 .",
    "recall that to linearize around  @xmath47 the map @xmath84 , one can write @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the exponential map of the lie group  @xmath45 , @xmath87 and  @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is identified with the lie algebra of  @xmath45 ) .",
    "the linearization of  @xmath90 is then given by @xmath91 applying this to  - , we find the linearized error system is @xmath92 where we have defined the `` products '' @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "notice the system  - as well as the matrices @xmath13 are in general not time - invariant unless the reference trajectory @xmath14 is permanent .",
    "since - has the same form as  - , we will be able to extend the usual separation principle around equilibrium points to a separation principle around permanent trajectories .",
    "the main benefit is that there are many more permanent trajectories thant equilibrium points .",
    "to stabilize the linearized error system  - we can use a linear controller - observer of the form  - . as in section",
    "[ sec : linobs ] , the control law  - with @xmath96 replacing @xmath97 stabilizes the equilibrium point @xmath81 of  . using the definitions of @xmath98 and the fact that @xmath99 we eventually find that @xmath100 stabilizes around the reference trajectory  - using only the measured output  .",
    "following  @xcite , we can easily design an invariant extended observer for invariant systems , using the invariant output error @xmath101 instead of the `` linear '' output error @xmath102 .",
    "such an observer reads @xmath103 where the gain matrix @xmath20 may depend on @xmath104 and on the output error  @xmath105 .",

    "indeed , @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "linearizing , this yields @xmath43 , so that the linearized closed - loop system @xmath114 is clearly stable .",
    "consider the simple planar non - holonomic model of a wheeled robot @xmath115 where the control inputs are the velocity  @xmath116 and @xmath117 the tangent of the steering angle ; @xmath118 and @xmath119 stand for @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we take for measurements the ( square of the ) distances to @xmath122 planar landmarks with known coordinates  @xmath123 , @xmath124 the measurement system could be for instance a set of ultrasonic emitters located at  @xmath123 , while the robot is equipped with ultrasonic receivers measuring the time of flight of the sonic waves .",
    "notice the only equilibrium points are given by @xmath125 and @xmath126 constant , i.e. the robot is at rest .",

    "this means the designed observer is convergent locally around _ every _ trajectory .      combining as in section  [ sec : extobslie ] the previously designed linearized controller and extended observer we end up with the control law @xmath168 where @xmath169",

    "such trajectories are very natural for mechanical systems and admit a geometrical interpretation ( they are generated by one - parameter subgroups of @xmath172 ) .",
    "they constitute interesting motion primitives that can be concatenated to yield a very large class of trajectories ( think of straight lines and coordinated turn in avionics which are permanent trajectories on @xmath183 @xcite ) . in the sequel",
    "we will prove that a local separation principle holds around those trajectories .",
    "consider the reference trajectory ( @xmath184 ) generated by a time - invariant @xmath185 .",
    "let @xmath186 be the corresponding control .",
    "let the invariant tracking error be @xmath187 as in @xcite .",
    "as the system is invariant , applying ( where @xmath116 is replaced by @xmath52 ) we have @xmath188 moreover we have , up to second order terms in @xmath189 @xmath190we have thus the following result :    [ lem : autonomous ] if @xmath191 and @xmath192 do not depend on @xmath56 , the linearized tracking error around permanent trajectories generated by @xmath193 is _ time - invariant_.    it implies that under assumptions of lemma [ lem : autonomous ] ( which are usually satisfied in practice ) , a local separation principle holds around permanent trajectories for the control problem - combined with an invariant observer for the subsystem , and where @xmath52 is known or measured .",
    "we believe that the problem addressed in this section is relevant to applications , and examples are left for future research .",
    "note that @xcite proved a separation principle for simple mechanical systems on lie groups where the position is measured , and a velocity observer must be designed .",
    "this is a different problem and a different approach is developed .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it relies on many restrictive assumptions .",
