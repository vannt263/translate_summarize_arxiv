    "in order to describe ideal tilings of hard spheres we need to review some notions of euclidean space @xmath5 , hyperbolic space @xmath6 , and spherical space @xmath7 geometry .",
    "note that the sphere space of ( surface ) dimension @xmath1 , @xmath7 , is defined by the set of all vectors of equal length in @xmath8 .",
    "hence @xmath9 is the standard sphere in @xmath10 . consider a ( non - overlapping ) configuration of @xmath11 hard spheres in @xmath1-dimensional space of volume @xmath12  @xcite , at positions @xmath13 .",
    "the neighbors of a particle are defined by the delaunay tessellation associated with those positions , and the distances are measured in units of hard - sphere diameter @xmath14 . in @xmath5 , a configuration therefore has a number density @xmath15 that is related to its packing fraction @xmath16 via @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of a @xmath1-dimensional ball of radius @xmath19 .",
    "a simplex contains @xmath0 vertices , and each of its faces is itself a lower - dimensional simplex ( triangle in @xmath1=2 , tetrahedron in @xmath1=3 ,  ) .",
    "it is thus the simplest polytope in any dimension .",
    "it also plays a central role in our analysis because , with probability one , simplices are the basic tiles of a delaunay tessellation .",
    "consider the @xmath20-simplices @xmath21 of a delaunay tessellation .",
    "of course , @xmath22 is the number of particles , @xmath23 is the number of bonds , and in general @xmath24 where the euler characteristic , @xmath25 , depends on the topology of the space considered .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be its average .",
    "we thus have that @xmath28 is the number of triangles sharing a common point , and that @xmath29 is the average number of triangles per vertex in a configuration . in this work ,",
    "we pay particular attention to _ bond spindles _",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "we also consider @xmath31 , the coordination number of the @xmath32 vertex , i.e. , @xmath31 is the number of @xmath33 wrapped around @xmath34 , and therefore @xmath35    in order to describe the regular tessellations of higher - dimensional space , we introduce schlfli s notation . in this recursive description of generalized regular polyhedra , the polytope @xmath36 is composed of polytopes @xmath37 with vertex figure @xmath38 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the _ vertex figure _ of a @xmath1-dimensional polytope is a @xmath39-dimensional polytope whose vertices are obtained by taking the middle of each edge emanating from a vertex .",
    "the basic example of this inductive scheme is @xmath40 , the regular polygon of @xmath41 sides in @xmath42 .",
    "we then have the regular polytopes in @xmath10 , which are represented by @xmath43 for a polytope having faces made of @xmath40 s and vertex figures made of @xmath44 s . for instance , the cube @xmath45 is composed of squares ( the regular polygon @xmath46 ) and the vertex figure is @xmath47 , a triangle .",
    "the cubic tiling @xmath48 in @xmath42 is composed of 4 squares surrounding each vertex .",
    "note also that simplices are denoted @xmath49 .",
    "( in schlfli symbols , exponentiation is understood to mean repetition , not multiplication . ) of particular relevance to this paper is the relation between schlfli s notation and the spindle coordination . for @xmath36 that is a regular tiling in @xmath5 or @xmath7",

    "any polytope @xmath36 in @xmath8 can be seen as inscribed in a sphere @xmath7 whose center is the center of mass of the polytope . inflating the polytope",
    "so as to make it round produces a regular tiling of @xmath7 . for instance , the hypercube @xmath51 in @xmath52 is also a regular tiling of @xmath53 .",
    "the usual case @xmath45 therefore gives @xmath54 on @xmath9 .",
    "the same argument illustrates that for the tiling @xmath55 of @xmath56 one has @xmath57 .",
    "we stress that in the case of hard - sphere fluids , we are interested in tilings by simplices .",
    "a detailed review of the possible regular simplicial tilings in various spaces is available in the supplementary material of ref .  . here",
    ", we only report the curvature of the space that would embed these tilings ( table  [ table : summary ] ) , and highlight a few key observations .    * a regular tiling of tetrahedra",
    "is found on the sphere that inscribes the remarkably large @xmath58 regular polytope @xmath59 . the inscribing sphere s curvature is much smaller than that of the generalized octahedron @xmath60 , the only other polytope exclusively made of simplices .",
    "* by contrast , on the @xmath1-dimensional sphere with @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the only way to obtain a regular tiling of simplices , which can only be achieved on a sphere of much higher curvature .",
    "* the regular simplicial tiling @xmath63 is found on a hyperbolic space of curvature larger ( in absolute value ) than the curvature of the sphere that inscribes the tiling @xmath64 , while the hyperbolic tiling @xmath65 s infinite edge length disqualifies it as a possible reference for euclidean packings of spheres .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the densest known crystal lattice in @xmath1=8 , the root lattice @xmath66 , is singularly dense , which arises from it having a remarkably high fraction of regular simplices in its midst  @xcite .",
    "each of the sites in the @xmath66 lattice is indeed surrounded by 2160 generalized octahedra and 17280 simplexes .",

    "the fluid behavior continuously evolves from the poisson limit and reasonably extends to the ideal packing limit ( rightmost point ) .",
    "the crystal phase , however , clearly sits on a different branch and even @xmath66 does not converge to the ideal limit .",

    "the narrower distribution of the 6:5 mixture compared to that of the 7:5 mixture at similarly sluggish conditions indicates that the former is closer to the ideal packing order than the latter . with increasing dimension",
    ", however , the distribution converges to that of the poisson limit . ]",
    "equilibrated hard - sphere fluid configurations with at least @xmath69 are obtained in @xmath1=38 , under periodic boundary conditions , using a modified version of the event - driven molecular dynamics code described in refs .",
    "time is expressed in units of @xmath70 for particles of unit mass @xmath71 at fixed unit inverse temperature @xmath72 .",
    "we also consider finite - pressure , hard - sphere crystals of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath66 lattice symmetry , which form the densest known packings in @xmath1=3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 , respectively .",
    "monodisperse spheres are used , except for @xmath1=3 fluids , where 50%:50% binary mixtures of diameter ratio 7:5 and 6:5 ( the larger sphere diameter sets the unit length ) are used to prevent crystallization , while systematically approaching the monodisperse limit .",
    "the densest packings of these systems is indeed thought to be fractionated  @xcite , and the complex phase behavior of similar mixtures at finite pressure suggests that the drive to crystallize is very small  @xcite .",
    "the properties of these mixtures have also been extensively characterized , e.g. , refs .  , and refs .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath76 is obtained by measuring the long - time behavior of the mean - squared displacement @xmath77 ^ 2=2ddt$ ] , while the pressure @xmath78 is mechanically extracted from the collision statistics .",
    "the quickhull package  @xcite provides a delaunay simplicial tessellation , which is analyzed to extract @xmath79 and @xmath68 . in @xmath80",
    ", a tessellation can be directly obtained for full periodic configurations , but in @xmath81 , the tessellation can only be obtained particle by particle , in order to minimize memory usage . in the second approach ,",
    "the values of @xmath82 are obtained by averaging the results over the different particles . in both cases ,",
    "the euler characteristic is explicitly computed to check the consistency of the approach . due to computational limitations ,",
    "the results in @xmath1=8 are only averaged over about 100 particles .",
    "as expected , the values of @xmath82 and @xmath68 are found to be intermediate between the poisson and the ideal packing limits for all _ fluid _ configurations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : highdsimplex ] ) .",
    "the fluid structure evolves smoothly from the poisson to the ideal packing limit , but without ever actually reaching the latter . in @xmath1=3 ,",
    "the 6:5 mixture approaches it more than the 7:5 , in agreement with the notion that the former is less geometrically frustrated than the latter .",
    "it also allows one to reasonably extrapolate that the a non - crystallizing monodisperse system would have a qualitatively similar behavior that what is found for the mixtures .",
    "the fluid order thus systematically tends toward an ideal simplex , or generalized polytetrahedral , packing .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , however , the ideal packing limit becomes ever more distant from the dynamically sluggish regime  @xcite .",
    "not only the mean , but the entire bond spindle distribution steadily converges to the poisson limit ( fig .  [",
    "fig : highdspindle ] ) . in that sense ,",
    "the highest - density equilibrated fluid that is dynamically accessible ( keeping diffusivity constant ) gets structurally ever closer to the poisson limit , rather than to an ideal simplex packing as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with higher dimensions corresponding to frustrated spaces , because a relatively high curvature would be needed to obtain a tiling of simplices .",
    "although not a measure of structural correlation directly , it suggests that extracting such a length from geometry would necessarily shrink with @xmath1 . because the static correlation length necessary for generating an equivalent slowing down of the dynamics shrinks with dimension , this inference is not in contradiction with static order underlying the process .",
    "we note , however , that the order in @xmath3 systems is _ not _ singularly closer to the ideal packing limit , even though the ideal simplex packing is much closer to euclidean space than for @xmath61 .",
    "remarkably , the dynamical slowdown in figure  [ fig : hsfragility ] also evolves smoothly with @xmath1 .",
    "this continuum of behavior suggests that any explanation that provides a singular role to the geometry of @xmath10 can not reasonably hold .",
    "another question of interest concerns the relationship between the fluid and crystal branches . for perfect crystal packings ,",
    "the crystal s delaunay tessellation is not generally simplicial .",
    "other regular polytopes can be identified . yet",
    "when adding thermal noise , and even in the limit of infinitely small noise , simplices are recovered with probability one . as a result , in @xmath1=3 the face - centered - cubic crystal has @xmath83=14 , not 12 , when approaching crystal close packing from lower densities  @xcite . in higher - dimensional crystals ,",
    "a similar behavior is observed , but no prediction for the limit behavior of @xmath68 is known . in general , the crystal branch is clearly different from the fluid branch , confirming that no crystallite form in these systems , in contrast to what happens in @xmath1=3 monodisperse hard spheres where crystallization is facile  @xcite . even in @xmath1=8 , where the @xmath66 crystal contains an inordinately high fraction of simplices , the fluid order follows a branch that is clearly distinct from the crystal branch .",
    "the crystal bond spindle behavior is even located outside of the fluid bounds .",
    "the dense @xmath1=8 fluid thus bears no trace of the high - simplicial nature of the crystalline phase . actually , even the crystal structure is but partially captured by the ideal packing .",
    "we stress that no mrco is found in high-@xmath1 fluids , confirming the conclusions of earlier fluid order studies  @xcite .",
    "the results of the above analysis indicate that the simple geometrical considerations brought forward to explain the dynamical slowdown are unlikely to provide any significantly growing static correlation length in hard - sphere glass - formers under compression .",
    "other measures of such a correlation length , _",
    "e.g. _ through bond - orientational order , confirm this conclusion ( see ref .",
    "for the case @xmath3 ) . yet this analysis does not exhaust the possibilities for more subtle forms of structural correlations .",
    "other proposals have been made based on nontrivial `` order agnostic '' lengths  @xcite , such as the patch repetition length associated with the notion of configurational entropy  @xcite , length scales extracted from finite - size  @xcite and information theoretic analysis  @xcite , as well as point - to - set correlation lengths  @xcite .",
    "the point - to - set correlation lengths , in particular , can be studied by considering the distance over which boundary conditions imposed by pinning particles in a fluid configuration affect the equilibrium structure of the remaining ( unpinned ) particles .",
    "the original proposal , motivated by the random first - order transition theory  @xcite , considered a cavity whose exterior is a frozen fluid configuration  @xcite . the crossover length characterizing the range over which the pinned boundary determines the configuration inside such a cavity also enters in a formula bounding from above the relaxation time of the ( bulk ) fluid  @xcite .",
    "yet other geometries of the set of pinned particles also allow one to extract point - to - set correlation lengths  @xcite .",
    "these lengths need not coincide nor evolve in exactly the same way as the system becomes sluggish , but they nonetheless characterize the same underlying physics .",
    "evidence for the growth of such lengths as the relaxation time increases has been found in several model glass - formers  @xcite .",
    "these point - to - set correlation lengths are more general than structural lengths based on a specific local order description and are thus expected to provide upper bounds for the latter .",
    "although they may provide less detailed geometrical information , and may be numerically harder to investigate over a broad dynamical range , it seems clear that a correlation between structure and dynamics , if present , should at least emerge at their level .",
    "for this reason , we complete our study of structural lengths related to ideal simplex order in hard - sphere glass - forming fluids with that of the `` order - agnostic '' point - to - set correlation length obtained from a random pinning of a fraction of the particles in equilibrium configurations .",
    "we consider a situation in which a fraction @xmath84 of the particles of an equilibrium fluid configuration is pinned at random .",
    "information about a possible static length scale growing with the dynamical slowdown as one compresses the fluid is then obtained from the long - time limit of the overlap between the original configuration and the configuration equilibrated in the presence of the pinned particles . if the reference and the final configurations are quite similar , the average pinning spacing is shorter than the static correlation length , and the opposite if the two configurations are dissimilar .",
    "previous studies have chosen an _",
    "ad hoc _ boxing of space  @xcite , but in systems where the particle density is changed , it is more robust to measure the configuration overlap by means of a microscopic overlap function @xmath85 where @xmath86 is chosen sufficiently small to enforce single overlap occupancy for hard spheres . for a fraction @xmath84 of pinned particles we therefore have @xmath87 where the brackets denote an average over equilibrium configurations",

    "<S> possible answers to both questions have been proposed , based on the concept of `` frustration '' . </S>",
    "<S> frustration in this context refers to an incompatibility between some local order that is preferred in the fluid and a global periodic tiling of space  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of frustration requires knowledge of the relevant type of local order , a difficult ( and unsolved ) task in the case of a generic molecular glass - forming liquid . </S>",
    "<S> hard - sphere fluids however are well suited for the task , because they are minimal model glass formers and their geometry is unambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> frustration is then purely geometrical . </S>",
    "<S> for monodisperse and moderately polydisperse hard - sphere fluids , the locally preferred order is based on tetrahedral arrangements of 4 particles , which when combined in larger units leads to icosahedral , or more rigorously polytetrahedral , order whose extension to the whole space is indeed frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> as often in physics , insight is gained by enlarging the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> geometrical frustration can be varied and fruitfully studied by varying the properties of the embedding physical space , either by introducing curvature  @xcite or by changing the number of dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we follow here the latter route .    </S>",
    "<S> three - dimensional tetrahedral order generalizes to `` simplicial order '' in all dimensions , the simplex being the ideal packing of @xmath0 particles in @xmath1 dimensions : a triangle in 2 dimensions , a tetrahedron in 3 dimensions , a `` hyper - tetrahedron '' in higher dimensions . in @xmath2 , </S>",

    "<S> dimensional studies have already unambiguously answered the above question _ ( i ) _ in the case of hard - sphere systems  @xcite , by showing that the local orders of the fluid and the crystal become increasingly different as dimension increases and that , as a result of this frustration , crystallization is strongly suppressed in dimensions @xmath4 . whereas crystallization kinetically interferes in three - dimensional monodisperse hard - sphere fluids  @xcite , so that one needs to consider binary or polydisperse mixtures in order to study the metastable fluid branch  @xcite , going to higher dimensions sidesteps this particular issue by suppressing crystallization even in monodisperse systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the question that we address in this paper is then the second one , namely the connection between the dynamical slowdown and the growth of static structural correlations , which result in the super - arrhenius , or fragile , dynamical behavior of glass - forming fluids . if indeed the phenomenon is collective , it should be accompanied by the development of nontrivial correlations to which one should be able to associate one or several typical length scales . </S>",
    "<S> it has been realized in the past two decades that slow relaxation in glass formers has an increasingly heterogeneous character , which can be captured by an appropriately defined `` dynamical '' length obtained through multi - point space - time correlation functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the somewhat different issue that we consider here is whether the slowing down itself , as described by the increase of the structural relaxation time or the viscosity , is accompanied by the growth of a static length .    </S>",
    "<S> there has been a number of proposals for relating dynamics and structure that include some measure of the spatial extension of a characteristic locally preferred arrangement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in the present work various measures of frustrated simplicial order in hard - sphere fluids in dimensions ranging from 3 to 8 . </S>",
    "<S> our results , which combine analytical and numerical approaches , show that the growth of associated structural correlations under compression is very limited in the density range that is accessible to computer simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can be rationalized by invoking the strong degree of frustration that is present , even in @xmath3 , and that limits the putative collective behavior due to the extension of the frustrated local order . </S>",
    "<S> it could of course be that the structural correlations related to simplicial order do not capture the relevant static correlations that affect the dynamical slowdown . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore also investigate `` order - agnostic '' lengths , which characterize static point - to - set correlations ; they are expected to provide upper bounds to the more specific length scales associated with local order while being more directly related to the cooperative nature of the dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the evolution with density of such point - to - set lengths is quite limited in a domain where the relaxation time nonetheless increases by several orders of magnitude and the length associated with the dynamical heterogeneity grows by a factor of 4 or 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ sect : geobackgnd ] and  [ sect : geofrus ] , we review notions of higher - dimensional simplicial geometry as well as various geometrical proposals for linking the local geometrical order and the dynamical slowdown of fluids , respectively . in section  [ </S>",
    "<S> sect : liquidorder ] , we obtain analytical bounds for the fluid order and numerically characterize the simplicial structure of hard - sphere fluids in @xmath1=3 to 8 . in section  [ sect : liquidagnostic ] , we describe features of an `` order - agnostic '' structural length , calculate its growth for two hard - spheres fluids in @xmath1=3 , and compare the results with a bound extracted from the fluid dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a brief conclusion follows . </S>"
