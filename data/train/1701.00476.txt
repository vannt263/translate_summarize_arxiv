    "the minus order was introduced by hartwig @xcite and independently by nambooripad @xcite , in both cases on semigroups , with the idea of generalizing some classical partial orders .",
    "it was extended to operators in infinite dimensional spaces independently by antezana , corach and stojanoff @xcite and by @xmath0emrl @xcite .",
    "there is now an extensive literature devoted to this order and other related partial orders on matrices , operators and elements of various algebraic structures .",
    "see for example , @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to obtain a new characterization of the minus order for operators acting on hilbert spaces in terms of the so called range additivity property . given two linear bounded operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 acting on a hilbert space @xmath3 , we say that @xmath1 and @xmath2 have the _ range additivity property _ if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for the range of an operator @xmath6 .",
    "operators with this property have been studied in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recall that if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two bounded linear hilbert space operators then @xmath7 ( where the symbol `` @xmath8 '' stands for the minus order of operators ) if and only if there are oblique projections @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this paper , we prove that this is equivalent to the range of @xmath2 being the direct sum of ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath13 and the range of @xmath14 being the direct sum of ranges of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus the minus order is intrinsically algebraic in nature .",
    "this plays an equivalent role to a known characterization when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are matrices @xcite ; that @xmath7 if and only if the rank of @xmath13 is the difference of the rank of @xmath2 and the rank of @xmath1 .    as a consequence ,",
    "diverse concepts that have been developed for matrices and operators are in fact manifestations of the minus order .",
    "these include , for example , the notions of weakly bicomplementary matrices defined due to werner @xcite , and quasidirect addition of operators defined by lenjak and emrl @xcite .",
    "although in these papers the minus order does not appear explicitly , these notions when applied to operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equivalent to saying that @xmath17 .",
    "the minus order also lurks in the papers of baksalary and trenkler @xcite , baksalary , @xmath0emrl and styan @xcite , mitra @xcite and arias , corach and maestripieri @xcite .",
    "the minus order can be weakened to what we call left and right minus orders . as with the minus order ,",
    "these orders are easily derived from a range additivity condition .",
    "it happens that they truly differ from the minus order only in the infinite dimensional setting .",
    "when @xmath7 , we give some applications to formulas for generalized inverses of sums @xmath18 in terms of generalized inverses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and we show that certain optimization problems involving the operator @xmath18 can be decoupled into a system of similar problems for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we collect some useful known results about range additivity , while in section 3 , the minus order is defined and the connection with range additivity is made .",
    "motivated by the concepts of the left and the right star orders , we define left and the right minus orders on @xmath19 . for matrices , these are equivalent to the minus order , with differences only emerge in the infinite dimensional context .",
    "proposition  [ leftminus and projections ] characterizes the left minus order in terms of densely defined , though not necessarily bounded , projections .",
    "additionally , the left minus , the right minus and the minus orders are characterized in terms of ( densely defined ) inner generalized inverses , generalizing a matricial result ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to applications .",
    "we begin by relating the minus partial order to some formulas for reflexive inner inverses of the sum of two operators . in particular",
    ", we give an alternative proof for the fill - fishkind formula for the moore - penrose inverse of a sum , as found in @xcite for matrices and extended to @xmath20 by arias et al .",
    "we also apply the new characterization of the minus order to systems of equations and least squares problems .",
    "we include a final remark about a possible generalization of the minus order involving densely defined projections with closed range .",
