    "the study of diffusion on statistically self - similar disordered media ( e.g. percolation clusters and diffusion limited aggregates ) is simplified by modeling their structure by deterministic fractals @xcite . although scaling theory has been central in studying diffusive processes on a variety of deterministic fractals @xcite , it has been noted that scaling laws do not provide a complete picture of dynamic phenomena on fractals @xcite , and exact relationships are useful .    lately there has been interest in calculating the mean time @xmath8 taken for a walker released from a randomly chosen node on a fractal to arrive at a trap .",
    "we call the underlying probability density of @xmath0 the global first passage time ( gfpt )",

    "in general , deterministic fractals have played a key role in explaining diffusion in disordered materials because their properties can be exactly studied . in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we formulate the problem of continuum diffusion on networks of pipes as an algebraic system of equations involving laplace transforms of the fluxes and concentrations at each node .",
    "we show how the equations are solved on a @xmath2-dimensional sierpinski gasket lattice using a renormalization procedure . in  3 , we derive the general formula for the laplace transform of the gfpt density for a trap at an arbitrary node on the gasket .",
    "we demonstrate our method for the apex of the @xmath10th iteration of the @xmath2-dimensional gasket .",
    "our results , for the mean of the gfpt , agree with prior work @xcite , and are extended to show that , for any given trap , there is an exact analytic expression for the moment generating function of the gfpt .    in  4 , we demonstrate that the method can be used to calculate the gfpt moment generating function for at least one node on any structure provided that a renormalization procedure exists .",
