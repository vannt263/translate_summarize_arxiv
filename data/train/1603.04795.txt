    "the global dynamics of a yang - mills field propagating in a four - dimensional minkowski spacetime is well understood : all solutions starting from smooth initial data at @xmath1 remain smooth for all times @xcite and decay to zero as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the global - in - time regularity holds true in any globally hyperbolic four - dimensional curved spacetime @xcite , however the phase portrait can be richer due to existence of nontrivial stationary solutions which play the role unstable attractors , as was shown for the schwarzschild background  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the evolution of a yang - mills field on the exterior of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "our study is motivated by the expectation that an interplay between the conformal structure of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole and the conformal invariance of the yang - mills equations may lead to an interesting behaviour of solutions .",
    "this is a continuation of our studies of how the dissipation - by - dispersion phenomena , responsible for the relaxation to a stationary equilibrium in extended hamiltonian systems , depend on the geometry of the underlying spacetime @xcite .",
    "the exterior ( i.e. , the domain of outer communication ) of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole is a globally hyperbolic static spacetime @xmath3 whose metric , in coordinates @xmath4 , reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is positive constant .",
    "the metric @xmath7 is a spherically symmetric solution of the einstein - maxwell equations with mass @xmath6 and charge @xmath8 . in order to better see the global properties of this spacetime , it is convenient to use dimensionless variables @xmath9 : @xmath10 in terms of which the metric takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 hereafter , for typographical convenience we use the abbreviation @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the ricci scalar vanishes both for @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath15 , the spacetime @xmath16 is geodesically complete .",
    "it has two asymptotically flat ends at @xmath17 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "asymptotic flatness is easily seen in terms of the coordinate @xmath18 for which we have @xmath19    .,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    note that the reflection @xmath20 is the isometry of the metric @xmath14 but only the conformal isometry for the metric @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "on @xmath21 the reflection interchanges the left and the right future null infinities , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while on @xmath3 it interchanges the event horizon and @xmath23 .",

    "we assume the spherically symmetric purely magnetic ansatz @xmath33 which gives @xmath34 note that the vacuum is given by @xmath35 , while @xmath36 corresponds to the magnetic monopole with unit charge . inserting the ansatz into",

    "starting at @xmath39 from smooth initial data remain smooth for all future times .",

    "our analysis is restricted to solutions with finite ( conserved ) energy @xmath41 dx < \\infty\\,.\\ ] ] due to dissipation of energy by dispersion , such solutions are expected to settle down to critical points of the potential energy , i.e. static solutions of eq ..",
    "time - independent solutions @xmath42 of eq .",
    "satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath43 we claim that , besides the constant solution @xmath44 , eq . has a countable family of smooth finite energy solutions @xmath45 ( @xmath46 with the following properties ( which , not very surprisingly , bear remarkable similarities to the bartnik - mckinnon solutions of einstein - yang - mills equations @xcite ) :    * @xmath45 has @xmath47 zeros , * @xmath48 for all finite @xmath49 and @xmath50 , * @xmath45 is an even ( resp .",

    "the proof of existence of solutions @xmath53 and their properties is a straightforward adaptation of the proof given in @xcite in the case of harmonic maps between 3-spheres ( which satisfy the same equation as with the nonlinearity @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 ) .",
    "key to the proof is the fact that eq .",
    "is asymptotically autonomous with the limiting equations for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , having saddle points at @xmath35 and a spiral at @xmath36 ( stable at @xmath58 and unstable at @xmath59 ) . using a shooting method",
    "one can show that there exist infinitely many homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits connecting the saddle points .",
    "the solutions are parametrized by the coefficients of the stable directions of the saddle points @xmath60 we refer the interested reader to @xcite for the details .",
    "note that due to the reflection symmetry @xmath61 , each solution @xmath53 has a copy @xmath62 .",

    "following @xcite and @xcite , we define the auxiliary variables @xmath64 and rewrite eq . as the first order symmetric hyperbolic system",
    "@xmath65 we solve this system numericaly using the method of lines with an 8th - order finite difference scheme in space and 4th - order runge - kutta integration in time . at the boundaries we use one - sided stencils .",
    "note that there are no ingoing characteristics at the boundaries , hence no boundary conditions need , or can , be imposed .",
    "as expected , for generic intial data the solution tends to one of the vacuum solutions @xmath66 . for intermediate times",
    "we observe ringdown along the fundamental quasinormal mode , while for later times the polynomial tail is seen to dominate ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "if initial data are close to an unstable static solution , then for early times we observe an exponentially fast departure from this solution along its principal unstable mode .",
    "this behaviour , in the case of a small perturbation of @xmath71 , is shown in fig .",
    "4 .     at a sample point @xmath67 . for early times",
    "we see the exponential growth along the principal unstable mode around @xmath71 with the lyapunov exponent @xmath72 .",
    "afterwards , the evolution proceeds as in fig .",
    "3.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    since parity is preserved in evolution , solutions starting from odd initial data can not tend to @xmath68 .",
    "generically , odd solutions converge to @xmath73 ( whose single unstable mode is even and therefore not excited ) .",
    "if we add a small even admixture of size @xmath74 to odd initial data , then @xmath73 appears as an intermediate attractor with lifetime @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the lyapunov exponent of the unstable mode of @xmath73 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "( black ) and @xmath77 ( red ) at a sample point @xmath67 .",
    "initially , both solutions evolve together and ring down to @xmath73 along its least damped odd quasinormal mode with frequency @xmath78 .",
    "later , the solution with the small even admixture departs towards @xmath68 along the unstable mode of @xmath73 with the lyapunov exponent @xmath79.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]      finally , we discuss the late time polynomial tails .",
    "in contrast to the ringdown , which is sensitive to the interior structure of the spacetime and depends on the final attractor , the tails for the yang - mills field on an asymptotically flat spacetime are universal .",
    "they decay as @xmath80 in the interior ( @xmath81 ) and as @xmath82 along future null infinities ( @xmath83 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spatial profiles of tails also appear to be universal .",
    "this can be seen by the following heuristic argument .",
    "consider a solution tending asymptotically to @xmath68 .",
    "substituting @xmath84 into eq . and",
    "linearizing , we get @xmath85 discarding the growing solution , we obtain @xmath86 hence for @xmath87 and large @xmath88 @xmath89 where the amplitude @xmath90 is the only trace of initial data . by an analogous argument , for @xmath91 and large @xmath88 @xmath92 in general , @xmath93 .",
    "it follows from that for large @xmath88 @xmath94 hence higher derivatives grow in time .",
    "this result can also be derived by inserting the power series expansion near @xmath23 , @xmath95 into eq . and solving the resulting system of ordinary differential equations iteratively starting from @xmath96 .",
    "the formula reflects the fact that the decay of the yang - mills field is not uniform in space ( because the decay along @xmath97 is slower than the decay in the interior ) . by the conformal invariance of the problem at hand , the formula holds for the derivatives of yang - mills field at the future horizon of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this type of instability for solutions of the wave equation on the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole was discovered by aretakis @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the relationship between the behavior of fields near the future ( degenerate ) horizon and the future null infinity ) .",
