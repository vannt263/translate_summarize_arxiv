    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath4 at @xmath10 k led to a new paradigm for achieving high critical temperatures in conventional superconductors , namely strong electron - phonon coupling due to metallization of strong covalent bonds.@xcite in mgb@xmath0 , this is achieved through the interaction of electrons forming covalent b - b bonds in the graphene - like layers with vibrational modes that stretch and compress these bonds.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , efforts to find related materials with even higher @xmath9 have not been fruitful .",
    "this is basically because the electronic states that form the covalent bonds in mgb@xmath0 are quasi two - dimensional , which makes it difficult to enhance their density of states and their coupling to phonons through simple doping.@xcite significant progress may only be possible through the introduction of different types of electronic states at the fermi level.@xcite    the recent discovery of superconductivity in cac@xmath11 at @xmath12 k,@xcite the highest critical temperature among graphite intercalation compounds ( gics ) , offers an alternative path to increasing @xmath9 .",
    "although cac@xmath3 is structurally similar to mgb@xmath0 , it appears that the key electrons and phonons responsible for its superconductivity are distinct from those in mgb@xmath1.@xcite in particular , free - electron - like states that are concentrated in the region between graphene layers dominate the electron - phonon interaction through coupling with soft intercalant modes and with bond - bending modes of the graphene sheet .",
    "incipient lattice instabilities associated with the soft intercalant phonon modes , however , may present obstacles to attaining significantly higher @xmath9 in gics.@xcite    it is intriguing to ask whether the mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath3 mechanisms for strong electron - phonon coupling can be incorporated into a single compound to create a superconductor with the potential to surpass mgb@xmath0 .",
    "although neither mgb@xmath0 nor cac@xmath3 can be easily modified so as to incorporate the key electronic and phonon players from the other material , we show here that it is indeed possible to combine the mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath3 paradigms in a different material .",
    "such a material has a good chance of exceeding both mgb@xmath1 and cac@xmath3 in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "the material of interest is a hypothetical layered form of lithium monoboride , li@xmath0b@xmath0 , that recent calculations have predicted to be competitive in energy with known lib phases.@xcite the b graphene sheets in li@xmath0b@xmath0 are nearly identical to those in mgb@xmath0 . at the fermi level , there are @xmath2 bands derived from b @xmath13 orbitals that form covalent bonds within the layers , as in mgb@xmath0 , and there are interlayer free - electron - like bands , which we shall call @xmath14 bands , as in cac@xmath3 . by accident ,",
    "the b @xmath15-derived @xmath5 states that are present in both mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath3 are missing at the fermi level in li@xmath0b@xmath0 .",
    "based on the similarity of the in - plane b physics with mgb@xmath0 , kolmogorov and curtarolo have suggested that this material could be a good superconductor in the mold of mgb@xmath0.@xcite    in this paper , we analyze the electronic structure of li@xmath0b@xmath0 and show that the electron - phonon interaction has sizable contributions not only from the @xmath2 bands that dominate the coupling in mgb@xmath0 , but also from the interlayer @xmath14 bands , which are the key players in cac@xmath3 . surprisingly , the total electron - phonon coupling in li@xmath0b@xmath0 is found to be weaker than in either of the other two materials .",
    "we show that this is precisely because of the missing @xmath5 electrons at the fermi level .",
    "though the @xmath5 bands in mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath3 give only moderate contributions to the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath5 electrons can indirectly strengthen the coupling of @xmath2 electrons with b bond - stretching phonon modes through screening . doping li@xmath4b@xmath4 to add @xmath8 sheets to the fermi surface",
    "would enhance the @xmath2 contribution to the electron - phonon coupling , as well as add a modest @xmath5 contribution . while a relatively low @xmath9 is predicted for pristine li@xmath0b@xmath0 , an appropriately doped material could have a @xmath9 higher than even mgb@xmath16",
    "our analysis is based on density functional calculations .",
    "the electronic structure was calculated using the wien2k general potential lapw code,@xcite with the gga functional in the pbe form.@xcite local orbitals were added to relax the remaining linearization error and apw orbitals were used to improve the convergence with respect to the cutoff parameter @xmath17 in most calculations @xmath18 was used , except for the convergence tests with @xmath19 up to 918 irreducible * k*-points were used ( 32@xmath20 ) .",
    "the phonon spectrum and electron - phonon coupling functions were calculated using the linear - response method@xcite within the local density approximation .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite were used , with a plane - wave cutoff of 50 ry .",
    "the dynamical matrix was calculated on a grid of @xmath21 phonon wavevectors * q * in the brillouin zone and fourier interpolated to denser meshes for calculation of the phonon density of states ( dos ) .",
    "for calculation of the electron - phonon matrix elements , the electronic states were sampled on grids of @xmath22 * k*-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the structure of the hypothetical layered compound li@xmath0b@xmath0 , first proposed in ref .",
    "( in which it is called ms2 ) , consists of honeycomb b sheets , each surrounded above and below by layers of li on a triangular lattice .",
    "there is a horizontal shift between neighboring li - b - li sandwich units , leading to an abab ... stacking sequence of the li - b - li trilayer units .",
    "while we find that the optimized structural parameters , particularly the interlayer distances , are sensitive to the details of the electron - ion potential and to the exchange - correlation functional , the band structures calculated within the different approximations are very similar . for the results presented here , we have fixed the structural parameters to the optimized values reported in ref . .",

    "two li layers lie between each pair of b sheets .",
    "the @xmath14 states are primarily concentrated in the interlayer region , but have some b @xmath15 character as well .",
    ", width=1 ]    the band structure of li@xmath4b@xmath4 near the fermi level is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] .",
    "as expected , the @xmath2 ( blue ) and @xmath8 ( green ) states are derived primarily from in - plane b @xmath28 and out - of - plane b @xmath29 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 bands ( magenta ) have substantial li @xmath31 and b @xmath29 character .",
    "the charge density of the @xmath32 electrons , plotted in fig.[fig : charge ] , is concentrated in the region between li - b - li trilayer units , though hybridization with b @xmath15 orbitals is evident .",
    "this is similar to the character of @xmath14 bands in gics.@xcite the fermi level in li@xmath0b@xmath0 lies at the crossing of the @xmath8 and @xmath33 bands at k , reminiscent of pure graphite .",
    "note , however , that in graphite , the coincidence of the fermi level with the @xmath8-@xmath34 crossing is mandated by the absence of other bands near @xmath35 , while in li@xmath0b@xmath0 , it is accidental .",
    "( expanding @xmath36 by @xmath37% , for example , moves the @xmath5-@xmath38 crossing away from the fermi level by more then 0.5 ev . ) compared to pure graphite , the presence of li atoms between the b - based graphene sheets i ) makes the @xmath8 bands more 3d and lowers their energy relative to the @xmath39 bands , and ii ) lowers the @xmath30 bands due to the attractive ionic potential in the interlayer region where the electronic charge in the @xmath32 bands is concentrated.@xcite with these relative shifts in the bands , the @xmath40 bands , which are completely filled in pure graphite , become partially occupied in li@xmath4b@xmath4 , while the @xmath30 bands , which are unoccupied in graphite , cross the fermi level in li@xmath4b@xmath7 .",
    "hence li@xmath4b@xmath4 can be viewed as a self - doped analog to pure graphite , with holes in the @xmath40 bands exactly compensated by electrons in the @xmath30 band .",
    "in contrast , in cac@xmath11 the @xmath33 band is partially occupied as well .    in comparing the band structures of li@xmath4b@xmath4 and mgb@xmath4 , which both have b honeycomb sheets separated by intercalant \" layers that donate one electron per b site",
    ", key differences in the relative energies of the different types of bands can be attributed to the difference in the separation between b layers . with two li layers between b sheets in li@xmath4b@xmath4 ,",
    "the b - b interlayer distance in li@xmath4b@xmath4 ( 5.4  ) is significantly larger than in mgb@xmath4 ( 3.5  ) .",
    "this makes the @xmath13-derived @xmath40 bands more 2d in li@xmath4b@xmath4 , but has little effect on their in - plane dispersion . as in mgb@xmath4 , these bands give rise to nearly cylindrical hole sheets of the fermi surface surrounding the @xmath41 to a line . as can be seen in the fermi surface plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] , there are two nearly degenerate pairs of @xmath2 cylinders .",
    "the larger separation between b planes also causes the b @xmath29-derived @xmath8 bands to be more 2d in li@xmath4b@xmath4 and raises them in energy so that the @xmath42 band that is partially occupied in mgb@xmath43 becomes unoccupied ( and just touches @xmath35 at certain points in the brillouin zone ) .",
    "the fermi surface due to the @xmath8 bands thus disappears in li@xmath4b@xmath4 . on the other hand , the free - electron - like @xmath30 bands , which are unoccupied in mgb@xmath4 , drop in energy when",
    "the interlayer distance is increased since there is a larger interlayer volume available for the electrons to occupy.@xcite in li@xmath4b@xmath4 , the @xmath30 bands produce a slightly squashed ellipsoidal fermi surface around @xmath41 , with a smaller effective mass for motion along the @xmath44 direction than in the plane .",
    "these ellipsoids are huge compared to the small @xmath14 balls in the cac@xmath3 fermi surface,@xcite even though cac@xmath11 has the most occupied @xmath30 band among all gics.@xcite      the topological simplicity of the fermi surface of mgb@xmath0 , in which sheets of the fermi surface corresponding to bands of different character are widely separated in reciprocal space , is lost in li@xmath0b@xmath0 .",
    "not only do the @xmath14 ellipsoids cross all four @xmath2 cylinders , they also cross each other . at all of these crossings",
    ", there is only weak hybridization between the bands .",
    "the multiple crossings between sheets of the fermi surface arising from bands of different character , along with the presence of bands that nearly touch the fermi level , make brillouin - zone integrations sensitive to * k*-point sampling .",
    "this is especially an issue for calculations of the electron - phonon coupling constants , which involve double integrals over the fermi surface .",
    "the quantitative electron - phonon coupling results presented here likely have larger uncertainties than usual but this does not affect the qualitative picture that emerges .    b@xmath0 phonon density of states @xmath46 , electron - phonon spectral function @xmath47 , and ratio of @xmath48 to frequency @xmath49 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath50 , which is proportional to the inverse - frequency - moment of @xmath51 , has significant contributions from both low - frequency and high - frequency modes.,width=2 ]    the phonon density of states @xmath52 and electron - phonon spectral function @xmath53 calculated for li@xmath4b@xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph ] . the @xmath54 in - plane bond - stretching b modes that are the key players in superconductivity of mgb@xmath4 are also important in li@xmath7b@xmath4 , as indicated by the peak in the spectral function near 80 mev . in both materials ,",
    "these vibrational modes couple strongly to the b @xmath40 bands .",
    "given the similarity of the b in - plane physics in the two materials , one expects similar deformation potentials for the @xmath54 modes.curtarolo indeed , our frozen - phonon calculations using lapw - gga produce exactly the same deformation potential at @xmath55 a displacement @xmath56 opens a gap @xmath57 such that @xmath58 ev /  , precisely the same as found for mgb@xmath4.@xcite furthermore , while it is difficult to separate the electronic dos in li@xmath4b@xmath4 into contributions from different bands , as is routinely done in mgb@xmath59 the effective masses derived from the dispersion of the @xmath40 bands are within 10% of those in mgb@xmath4 ( the heavy band is 9% heavier and the light band 8% lighter ) .",
    "if the phonon frequencies were the same , one would then expect the net intraband electron - phonon coupling constant for the @xmath2 bands , @xmath60 , to be practically the same as in mgb@xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly , the phonon frequencies differ considerably . at the zone center ,",
    "the @xmath54 phonon frequency of 81 mev in li@xmath4b@xmath4 is signficantly higher that the corresponding 67 mev in mgb@xmath4,@xcite which likely reduces @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62    the hardening of the in - plane b bond - stretching modes in li@xmath4b@xmath4 is related to the loss of @xmath8 electrons at the fermi level . the same electron - phonon coupling process that gives rise to superconductivity also leads to electronic screening of phonons .",
    "for a zone - center phonon mode , the softening due to screening by metallic electrons is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a fermi - surface average of the square of the electron - phonon matrix element @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the electronic dos at the fermi level.@xcite because the matrix element @xmath65 contains a factor of @xmath67 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : softening ] is independent of the phonon frequency @xmath68 . in mgb@xmath4 , both the @xmath40 and @xmath8 electrons participate in screening the bare @xmath54 phonons . for the @xmath54 mode in mgb@xmath0",
    ", it has been estimated that @xmath69 is reduced by about 1500 mev@xmath70 due to screening by @xmath8 electrons , and by about 2000 mev@xmath70 due to screening by @xmath71 electrons , and that the unscreened frequency is @xmath72 mev.@xcite in li@xmath4b@xmath4 , the unscreened frequency and the softening due to @xmath40 bands should be roughly the same magnitude as in mgb@xmath0 , which gives a rough estimate for the screened @xmath54 phonon frequency of @xmath73 mev .",
    "this is consistent with our actual calculations for li@xmath4b@xmath74 which yield a frequency of 81 mev at the zone center .",
    "since only phonons with @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radius of the cylindrical @xmath40 sheets of the fermi surface , can couple to @xmath2 electrons , softening by @xmath40 electrons is only significant when the in - plane component of the phonon wavevector is less than @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , at the zone boundary , our calculations yield a frequency of 92 mev for the lowest @xmath54 branch , consistent with estimates for the unscreened @xmath54 frequency .",
    "while li@xmath4b@xmath4 also has @xmath30 electrons , which are not present in mgb@xmath4 , these are largely localized in the interlayer region and do not couple strongly with the b bond - stretching modes , so they are less effective in screening the @xmath54 phonons .",
    "the harder @xmath78 frequencies in li@xmath4b@xmath4 compared to mgb@xmath4 can thus be attributed to the absence of screening by @xmath8 electrons .",
    "in addition to the high - frequency @xmath54 peak in the spectral function , there is a low - frequency peak in @xmath79 arising from ultrasoft modes that involve rigid shifts of the b planes in the @xmath44 direction coupled with both in - plane and out - of - plane motion of the li atoms .",
    "the frequency of these ultrasoft modes is sensitive to calculational details , so at @xmath41 , for example , the harmonic frequency of about 8 mev obtained in our lda linear - response calculation is somewhat lower than the estimate of 11 mev based on force - constant methods using paw gga calculations.@xcite in any case , these low - frequency normal modes couple with the @xmath30 bands , similar to the situation in cac@xmath3 , where ca sliding modes interact strongly with interlayer electrons .",
    "although relatively small , the low - frequency peak in @xmath80 gives a similar contribution to the isotropic electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath81 as the high - frequency peak ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ph ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the total @xmath50 is calculated to be 0.57 , with the low - frequency peak contributing about 0.15 , and the @xmath54 peak contributing about 0.2 .",
    "the logarithmically averaged phonon frequency of @xmath82=39 $ ] mev , is well below the average frequency of @xmath83 mev , reflecting the importance of the ultrasoft modes .",
    "from the point of view of @xmath9 , the prospects for li@xmath0b@xmath0 do not look optimistic compared to mgb@xmath74 because of both the lack of a @xmath5-band contribution to @xmath84 and , perhaps more importantly , the hardening of the key @xmath54 phonons that are no longer screened by @xmath8 electrons . neglecting possible multiband effects and using the mcmillan equation@xcite with a typical coulomb parameter of @xmath85 we estimate @xmath86 k. in comparison , the estimated _ isotropic _ @xmath87 in mgb@xmath4 is 25 - 30 k. enhancement of @xmath9 due to interband anisotropy is expected to be weaker in li@xmath4b@xmath4 since the two groups of electrons contribute more equally to the coupling with phonons . but even if it were of the same order as in mgb@xmath74 that is , @xmath88 in the effective @xmath84 it would only increase @xmath87 to about 15 k. the bottom line is that li@xmath4b@xmath74 if synthesized , might be competitive with cac@xmath11 in terms of @xmath9 , but not with mgb@xmath89      while the _ undoped _",
    "li@xmath4b@xmath4 is isoelectronic with mgb@xmath74 and doping of mgb@xmath4 is known to unequivocally depress @xmath90 the same need not be true for li@xmath4b@xmath89 electron doping of mgb@xmath4 lowers the @xmath40 dos , and hence the electron - phonon coupling , since the bands are not ideally 2d .",
    "( though attempts have been made , hole doping of mgb@xmath0 has not yet been achieved . ) in li@xmath4b@xmath74 the @xmath40 bands are much more 2d , so doping should have little effect on their dos and electron - phonon coupling . on the other hand , electron doping would start filling the @xmath8 bands , increasing their dos . assuming rigid bands , doping on either b or li sites",
    "could be used to raise the fermi level by nearly 1 ev without losing the contribution from the @xmath40 bands .",
    "we estimate that this would increase the @xmath5-band dos to roughly half the value in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "doping on the li sites ( with al , be , mg , etc . )",
    "should yield even higher @xmath5 dos , since the extra ionic charge in the li planes would lower the @xmath8 bands relative to the @xmath40 bands .",
    "experience shows that it is hard to dope more holes into the @xmath40 bands than there already are in pure mgb@xmath4 .",
    "since li@xmath4b@xmath4 starts with more holes in the @xmath40 bands than mgb@xmath4 , it might even be easier to synthesize electron - doped li@xmath4b@xmath4 than the undoped material .",
    "assuming that the @xmath8 bands in doped li@xmath4b@xmath4 couple with the @xmath91 modes at about the same level as in mgb@xmath74 this additional coupling will soften the @xmath54 phonons and enhance their coupling with the @xmath40 bands , without strongly affecting the coupling of @xmath30 bands with soft modes .",
    "this is an extremely favorable combination that is likely to have a higher @xmath87 than mgb@xmath89 to a lesser extent the same holds if the accidental alignment of the fermi level with the @xmath8-@xmath42 crossing is modified by uniaxial pressure .",
    "while li@xmath4b@xmath4 and related layered lithium borides proposed by kolmogorov and curtarolo@xcite are only hypothetical materials as yet , their calculations of the li - b phase diagram have suggested a route for synthesizing these materials using pressure.@xcite we have shown that although li@xmath4b@xmath4 seems to combine the key mechanism for strong electron - phonon coupling in mgb@xmath0 with the dominant coupling mechanism in cac@xmath3 , each of which has the highest superconducting transition temperature in its respective class of materials , the transition temperature of li@xmath4b@xmath4 is expected to be lower because of the lack of the seemingly unimportant @xmath5 electrons at the fermi level .",
    "an appropriately doped version of the material , in which @xmath5 electrons are restored at the fermi level , however , could result in a promising new superconductor that combines the paradigms of mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath3 in a single material without loss .",
