    "the activity of many different neural networks  @xcite , can be described qualitatively with the following dynamics :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 represents the instantaneous spiking rate of the principal neurons ( pns ) that are making the computation , @xmath6 , represents the strength of inhibition in @xmath4 by @xmath7 , @xmath21 represents the action from other neural ensembles , and @xmath22 represents the stimuli from the sensors . in many neural networks ,",
    "the inhibition among pns is the result of the action of inhibitory local neurons ( lns ) .",
    "usually lns also receive an external input and because of this @xmath6 can depend on the stimuli .    the dynamical system ( [ eq2 ] ) in the case @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the lottka - volterra model .",
    "the dynamics of the system is well known when the matrix @xmath6 is symmetric ( @xmath25 ) . in this case",
    "the autonomous system has a global lyapunov function  @xcite and every trajectory approaches one of the numerous possible equilibrium points . for example ,",

    "a direct corollary of theorem 1 is the possibility of the birth of the stable limit cycle in system ( [ eq3 ] ) when perturbed in an appropriate way .",

    "such a condition can be expressed differently .",

    "we omit the proof in the present work , since it is really a standard one ( the corresponding technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , one may say that the system under consideration is robust in the following sense : the attractor of a perturbed system remains in a small neighborhood of the `` unperturbed '' attractor .",

    "as we have discussed , wlc networks produce identity - temporal or spatio - temporal coding in the form of deterministic trajectories moving along heteroclinic orbits that connect saddle fixed points or saddle limit cycles ( see fig .",

    "these saddle states correspond to the activity of specific neurons or groups of neurons and the separatrices connecting these states correspond to sequential switching from one state to another .    from the experimental results  @xcite we infer that a stimulus acts in two principal ways : ( 1 ) it excites a subset of projector neurons ; ( 2 ) it modifies the effective inhibitory connections between the projector neurons as a result of activation of the inhibitory interneurons that connect different pns .",

    "when @xmath230 , the quiet resting state @xmath231 is stable .",
    "when a stimulus is applied and @xmath232 , the system moves away from this quiet state onto a sequence of heteroclinic trajectories .",
    "this instability triggers the system into rapid action , provides robustness against noise and allows a response independent of the state at stimulus onset .    when the inhibitory connections are not symmetric , the system with @xmath30 competitive neurons has different closed heteroclinic orbits that consist of saddle points and one dimensional separatrices connecting them .",

    "these special sensory organs are responsible for the orientation in the gravitational field  @xcite .    it is well known from the physiological data that the statocysts have up to 12 receptor neurons ( srns ) that are coupled with inhibitory synapses  @xcite .",

    "these cpgs establish the habitual `` head up '' position of _ clione _ s body .",
    "however if a special hunting central neuron ( hcn ) receives a message from the chemo - sensors about the presence of a prey , hcn excites the srns organizing a wlc among them as we will illustrate with a model .",

    "for the phenomenological modeling of the statocyst `` hunting '' dynamics we can neglect the statolith inertial dynamics and take into account the only key point : the position of the mollusk s body uniquely depends on the message that srns are sending to the central neurons that produce the commands to the cpgs .",
    "thus , as a starting point , we consider just a srn network under the action of the hcn excitation . we suppose that , as a result of the hcn stimulation , all srns ( `` left '' , `` right '' , `` back '' , `` front '' , `` down '' , and `` up '' ) are in the same situation : they receive and send two inhibitory synapses ( see fig .",
    "[ statocyst ] , right panel ) .",
    "the dynamics of the srn s network can be described by model ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath250 . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 represents the instantaneous spiking rate of the receptor neuron @xmath4 , @xmath21 represents the stimulus from the hunting neuron to neuron @xmath4 , and @xmath22 represents the action of the statolith on the receptor that is pressing . when there is no stimulus from the hunting neuron ( @xmath251 ) or the statolith ( @xmath252 ) , then @xmath253 and all neurons are silent ; @xmath254 when the hunting neuron is active and/or the statolith is pressing one of the receptors . in our simulations , we have used the values @xmath255 specified in ( [ ros2 ] ) .    when there is no activation of the sensory neurons from the hunting neuron , the effect of the statolith ( @xmath256 ) in this model is to induce a higher rate of activity on one of the neurons ( the neuron @xmath4 where it rests for a big enough @xmath257 value ) .",
    "we assume that this higher rate of activity affects the behavior of the motoneurons to organize the head up position .",
    "the other neurons are either silent or have a lower rate of activity and we can suppose that they do not influence the posture of _ clione_.    when the hunting neuron is active a completely different behavior arises .",
    "we assume that the action of the hunting neuron overrides the effect of the statolith and thus @xmath258 .",
    "the dynamical system ( [ eq2 ] ) with the @xmath6 values specified above ( see also fig .",
    "[ statocyst ] ) and with a stimuli from the hunting neuron given , for example , by @xmath259 has a strange attractor in the phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ clioneat ] ) .",
    "this means that the srn network generates new information ( a chaotic signal with positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy ) in the presence of the prey , which controls the cpgs and , in fact , organizes the random - like behavior of _",
    "clione_.    the origin of the chaoticity in such dynamical system can be explained in the following manner  @xcite : due to the diversity in the strengths of the inhibitory connections we may consider the complete network as two weakly coupled wlc triangle networks .",
    "independently each of them has a closed heteroclinic contour ( see fig .",
    "[ statocyst ] ) , which becomes a limit cycle under the action of a small perturbation ( see sec .",
    "[ stable ] ) .",
    "the periodic oscillations corresponding to these limit cycles have , in general , different frequencies that are extremely sensitive to the distance to the heteroclinic loop in the non perturbed system ( such oscillations are strongly non - synchronous ) . as we showed the weak interaction of these wlc triangles ( nonlinear oscillators ) generate chaos in wide regions of the control parameter space .",
    "new experiments have confirmed the validity of the model and its predictions  @xcite .",
    "the stimulus dependent sequential switching of neurons or group of neurons ( clusters ) , named winnerless competition , is able to solve the fundamental contradiction between sensitivity and robustness of the sensory recognition .",
    "the key points on which the wlc networks are based are : ( i ) the heteroclinic contour corresponding to a specific sequence of switching has a large basin of attraction , i.e. a specific sequence is stable ; and ( ii ) the topology of the heteroclinic contour sensitively depends on the incoming signals , i.e. high resolution or sensitivity . both features",
    "are actually present only in the case if under the action of a perturbation the discussed heteroclinic contour , which is structurally unstable , is transformed to the limit cycle in its vicinity with the same topology as the contour . in this paper",
    "we have discussed the conditions for such topological stability , and we have showed that computing with separatrices based on the wlc principle is a very natural and powerful strategy for information processing in real neural systems",
    ". any kind of sequential activity can be programmed by a network with stimulus dependent nonsymmetric inhibitory connections .",
    "it can be the creation of spatio - temporal patterns of motor activity , the transformation of the spatial information into spatio temporal information for successful recognition and many other computations .",
    "in addition , we wish to mention that two important computational functions can be successfully implemented by computation with separatrices .",
    "these are : ( i ) sequential memory storage , and ( ii ) feature binding .",
    "in reference  @xcite the authors suggest a new biologically - motivated model of sequential spatial memory which is based on the wlc principle .",
    "each stimulus event ( visual image , odor , etc ... ) is represented by a saddle point in the phase space of the system , and a network of one - dimensional separatrices leads the system along the sequence of events in the specific episode .",
    "after the learning process , such system is capable of an associative retrieval of the pre - recorded sequence of spatial patterns .",
    "a binding problem occurs when two ( or more ) different events , e.g. scenes , features , or behaviors are represented by different neural ensembles simultaneously , and for some reason they are all connected with each other . eventually , these coherent features are integrated by the nervous system of the animal onto a perceptual object , even if the features are dispersed among different sensory systems or subsystems .",
    "the binding is ubiquitous and occurs whenever a simultaneous remembrance or representation is important .",
    "the most common approach in the modeling of binding is to involve time in operation ( von der malsburg , singer , and others ) .",
    "the idea is to use the coincidence of certain events in the dynamics of different neural units for binding .",
    "this is a dynamic binding .",
    "usually , dynamic binding is represented by synchronous neurons or neurons that are in resonance with and external field .",
    "however , dynamical events like phase or frequency variations usually are not very reproducible and robust .",
    "it is reasonable to hypothesize that brain circuits that display sequential switching of neural activity  @xcite use the coincidence of this switching to implement dynamic binding of different wlc networks .    in the conclusion we have to emphasize that for large inhibitory neural ensembles it is not necessary to have specific connections that satisfy the conditions formulated above for the existence and stability of the wlc dynamics .",
    "if the connections are random , the neurons in the ensemble can be separated in three groups : ( i ) neurons that are weakly coupled with others ( they behave like nearly independent elements ) , ( ii ) neurons with strong but close to symmetric connections ( they form a hopfield like network just with simple attractors ) , and ( iii ) neurons with nonsymmetric connections that demonstrate the wlc dynamics . because the wlc dynamics is a structurally stable phenomenon , it is reasonable to hypothesize that the perturbation of the third group by the first two does not destroy the switching activity .",
    "recent computer experiments  @xcite have confirmed this hypothesis .",
