    "in general , galactic open clusters are ensembles of stars with low central concentration and irregular shape .",
    "they constitute the outcome of a star forming region and are found across a range of evolving stages .",
    "open clusters arguably represent the growth of the disk of the galaxy via a smooth , self - regulated process of star formation , in contrast with globular clusters  formed during the early stages of the milky way  or with young massive clusters , found in starbursting galaxies .",
    "the fundamental difference between open and globular clusters appears to be the pressure of the environment , with open clusters formed in regions with low pressures ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . the complex formation history of the milky way , characterized by a number of events with enhanced star formation along with a smooth low - level constant formation ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2004 ) should be imprinted in the  fossil record \" represented by the open clusters , the globular clusters and the bulk of the stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "the total mass of an open cluster ranges from a few tens to a few thousands of solar masses ( see for example durgapal & pandey 2001 ) , and have typical diameters of a few to a few tens of pc .",
    "their stars form as dense clusters located within the parental giant molecular cloud ( pfalzner 2009 ) .",
    "unlike the case of globular clusters , the population of open clusters is very strongly concentrated along the galactic plane , which also makes them difficult to observe at large distances .",
    "as they evolve , open clusters undergo tidal evaporation into the bulk of the stellar populations of the galactic disk .",
    "this process is helped ( pfalzner 2009 ) if the cluster contains @xmath11,000 stars or more . with those numbers , a significant population of o stars",
    "is expected , whose stellar winds , together with supernovae from early - type stars , will expel the remaining gas , disturbing the clusters dynamical equilibrium . given this strong trend between cluster size and age",
    ", searches are often biased against old ( i.e. more dispersed ) systems , harder to separate from the stellar background .",
    "hence , open clusters are usually found to contain bright , blue stars , indicating young ages .",
    "in addition to age , metallicity is a property that can reveal the past history of stellar populations in clusters , disks and other components of the galaxy .",
    "for example , twarog et al . ( 1997 ) used metallicity to study the local structure and evolution of the disk , and friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , used this property to determine the metallicity gradient of the disk .",
    "this type of study is also illustrated more recently by fu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and magrini et al .",
    "the first group examine the radial gradient of the metallicity of open clusters along the galactic disk . from this",
    "they create a model whereby infalling gas grows the disk inside - out .",
    "their model accounts for current and past metallicity radial trends .",
    "the second group find evidence for inflow that varies radially , being lower in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "this clearly establishes metallicity as a key parameter in deducing the past star formation history .",
    "there are about 2,000 known galactic open clusters , but because they are difficult to observe , one should expect many more : piskunov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate the total number of open clusters could be of order @xmath2 .",
    "a large catalogue of open clusters was recently compiled from the literature by dias et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , henceforth referred to as daml .",
    "the catalogue includes information about the kinematics of the clusters as well as estimates from the literature of their ages and metallicities .",
    "several authors have used orbit calculations to study open clusters .",
    "piskunov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) considered the open cluster population in the all - sky catalogue ascc-2.5(i/280a , kharchenko , 2001 ) which is based on tycho2 , hipparcos , and other catalogues . from this , they calculate the open cluster orbits and identified four open cluster complexes , the members of which share kinetic behaviour and age . for example , the youngest complex ( age @xmath379 myr ) is identified in the gould belt .",
    "frinchaboy & majewski ( 2008 ) have made a study of open cluster 3-d kinematics .",
    "the first phase , reported in their paper , starts with creating a uniform set of kinematic parameters .",
    "for this , they measured the radial velocity of over 3,000 stars in open clusters and concentrated on those with tycho2 proper motion values .",
    "this amounts to 66 open clusters , with membership having been determined for radial velocity , proper motion , and spatial distribution .",
    "applications with orbits are due to follow .    finally , and of most relevance to our work , is the study of wu et al .",
    "they use the previous release ( 2.9 ) of daml , dated 2008 april 13 .",
    "their data analysis addresses distances , proper motion , and radial velocity .",
    "they adopt the daml distances , but use the proper motion data from kharchenko s ascc-2.5 catalogue ( kharchenko , 2001 ) .",
    "they find the effect of the re - reduction of hipparcos data by van leeuwen ( 2007 ) to be less than the error values in daml .",
    "regarding radial velocity , they substitute more recent values of frinchaboy & majewski ( 2008 ) , and of mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) into their data set .",
    "they use three different axisymmetric galactic potentials and calculate the orbits of over 400 open clusters for 5gyr back in time .",
    "the main conclusions related to orbits are that the velocity dispersion of open clusters increases with age , showing disk heating .",
    "they also find that the orbit eccentricity and maximum height above the galactic plane are affected most by uncertainties in distance .",
    "finally , they compare orbital eccentricity of globular clusters , disk giants , disk f and g dwarfs , and open clusters , and deduce that about 4% of open clusters are thick disk objects .",
    "this work extends the above by concentrating on unusual clusters , rather than the bulk of the population . in this paper",
    "we study the orbits of the daml open clusters within the galactic potential .",
    "section 2 presents the available data on open clusters , and describes the method of orbit integration . in section 3 , we present the results of a catalogue data validation , based mainly on orbit morphology , and self - consistency tests . in section 4 ,",
    "we carry out an analysis of cluster orbits , and in section 5 we identify clusters that may not be of purely thin disk origin , but instead due to events such as the impact on the galactic disk of a high velocity cloud , of a globular cluster , or a merger with a dwarf galaxy .",
    "daml was developed from an original source by mermilliod ( 1995 ) , now called webda which is still being maintained and updated , and which , combined with simbad s proper motion data , provides the necessary data for kinematic studies of open clusters .",
    "these proper motion data are from loktin & beshenov ( 2003 ) , and kharchenko et al .",
    "webda provides no errors on distances , but the simbad proper motion data have errors attributed to them .",
    "daml is a compilation of the data in the literature , of which one advantage is a single file with all the key data on the open clusters , with the latest updated version 2.10wilton ] , released on 2009 february 17 , which we use throughout this work .",
    "the daml catalogue contains entries for 1787 open clusters .",
    "the data fields in the catalogue include position on the sky , distance , proper motion , radial velocity , metallicity , size , colour excess , trumpler type , numbers of stars used in determining proper motion , metallicity and radial velocity , and where relevant , the error on these quantities .",
    "the extent of kinematic information available is that , of these 1787 clusters , 1114 clusters have at least an entry for the distance to the sun , and of these in turn , 481 have the data on distance , proper motion , and radial velocity , with 439 of these also having the age .",
    "information on metallicity is present for 111 of the set of 439 .    of the set of 439 ,",
    "86% have an age below 0.5gyr .",
    "the oldest reported in daml , berkeley17 , is @xmath1 10gyr , the youngest are @xmath11myr .",
    "the metallicity [ fe / h ] range is from @xmath40.835 to 0.27 dex , with 20% of values less than @xmath40.2 dex .",
    "both webda and daml , through studies such as that of kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , rely on stellar observational proper motion data in surveys , such as hipparcos ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , tycho2 ( h@xmath5 g et al .",
    "2000 ) , ucac2 ( zacharias et al . , 2004 ) , or 4 m ( frinchaboy & majewski 2008 ) .",
    "caution is needed with ucac2 and 4 m , because , according to frinchaboy & majewski ( 2008 ) , there may be systematic errors in the proper motion values .",
    "determination of errors in basic kinematic data is essential in assessing the strength of any conclusion resulting from orbit calculations .",
    "paunzen & netopil ( 2006 ) investigated the accuracy of other relevant open cluster data such as age and distance .",
    "they used eight papers on data compilations , and webda s references , checking that no piece of data is used more than once .",
    "this then represented data for 395 clusters , amounting to 6437 individual pieces of data .",
    "they determined the distributions of the absolute errors in age and distance via a statistical analysis of the sample .",
    "this shows the peak distribution for age and distance errors to lie in the respective intervals 40 - 60% , and 5 - 10% .",
    "paunzen & netopil ( 2006 ) also compared their result with the averages given in the 2005 october version of daml , and conclude that if using the parameters from this catalogue , the expected errors are comparable to those obtained independently from the literature .",
    "this provides support for using directly the uncertainty values from the catalogue , a view shared by lpine et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we recognise that the open cluster membership in daml is in no way volume , or age - limited , and no attempt is being made here to study the overall galactic open cluster system .",
    "we also recognise that the body of data on open clusters is changing , with new data being published between revisions by dias and collaborators .",
    "some more recent high - quality data , for example on radial velocity measurements ( e.g. mermilliod , mayor & udry , 2008 , and frinchaboy & majewski , 2008 ) , have not yet been taken into account in the latest ( 2.10 ) revision of the catalogue .",
    "this is an important area of improvement , as bovy et al.(2009 ) point out that the impact of a single star s radial velocity on that of a moving group can be significant .",
    "recognising that incremental improvements to the data on open clusters are taking place , nevertheless , our work aims to reach conclusions on the set of hitherto observed galactic open clusters for a clearly defined sample as provided in daml , and we therefore do not include these isolated changes .      to calculate the ( proper , rather than osculating ) orbits of the clusters , we use a galactic potential proposed by fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for this type of calculation , and assume it to be fixed in time .",
    "this potential has also been used by several authors , for example law et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , vande putte & cropper ( 2009 ) , and vande putte , cropper & ferreras ( 2009 ) to track a variety of objects in the galaxy .",
    "briefly , the potential is axisymmetric , and therefore uses cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance to the z axis , @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle between the x axis and the projection of the position vector on the xy plane , and @xmath9 the distance of the particle above the xy plane .",
    "this potential has three parts , representing a bulge , halo , and disk :    @xmath10    the bulge potential is given by a hernquist ( 1990 ) expression :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 kpc , and where @xmath14 is the galactocentric radius ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a halo contributes to the potential in a logarithmic form :    @xmath16    with @xmath17 km s@xmath18 , @xmath19 is a flattening parameter , taken as unity here , and @xmath20kpc .",

    "for this potential , the distance from sun to galactic centre is set at 8 kpc , with a local circular velocity of 220 km s@xmath18 .",
    "all calculations are carried out with a fixed cartesian galactocentric right - handed coordinate system .",
    "the x - axis points in the direction of motion of the local standard of rest ( lsr).the y - axis points from the galactic centre to the sun , so that the z - axis points to the north galactic pole ( ngp ) .",
    "the current cluster positions ( x , y , z ) used in the calculations are obtained from the cluster heliocentric distance , and its celestial coordinates .",
    "the velocities of a cluster with respect to the lsr are determined from its proper motion and radial velocity , and from the solar motion ( u@xmath25=10@xmath260.4 , v@xmath27=5.2@xmath280.6 , w@xmath25=7.2@xmath280.4 km s@xmath18 from dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) . within the lsr s own coordinate system , the u axis points towards the galactic centre , the v axis points in the direction of motion of the lsr , and the w axis points to the ngp .",
    "the transformation from radial velocities and proper motions to motion in the lsr ( u , v , w ) , uses the formalism of johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) .",
    "the elements of the transformation matrix of johnson & soderblom have been updated to the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) , based on ra(ngp)= 192.85948@xmath29 , dec(ngp)=+27.12825@xmath29 , and the ascending node of the galactic plane on the equator , @xmath30= 32.93192@xmath29 ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "the transformation from velocities in the lsr to velocities in our fixed galactocentric system ( @xmath31@xmath32 220 km s@xmath33 , @xmath34 = -u , @xmath35 = w ) uses an lsr velocity of 220@xmath2815 km s@xmath33 .",
    "the origin of the lsr is placed at 8kpc from the galactic centre ( binney & tremaine , 2008 ) .",
    "the relevant equations of motion are integrated using a fourth - order runge - kutta procedure implemented in a fortran code , and the code tolerance parameters set so as to conserve total energy and angular momentum to better than 10@xmath36 .",
    "we show in table [ ext1 ] some examples of the observed data relevant to the orbit calculations , whereas table [ ext2 ] displays the corresponding input data in the case of our galactocentric representation . in table",
    "[ ext2 ] , the distance error is set at 10% , and the error on the velocities also accounts for the error in the sun s motion in the lsr , and in the circular velocity at the solar radius .",

    "we note that , @xmath39 is @xmath40 km s@xmath37 larger than previously estimated ( see above ) , and this will have the greatest effect on @xmath41 in table [ ext2 ] .",
    "however , given the magnitude of @xmath41 and the size of the uncertainty in the velocity of the lsr ( @xmath115 km s@xmath37 ) , little effect is found on the nature of the orbits , or on the orbital parameters z@xmath42 and @xmath43 used in table [ tabclus ] ( differences for the top seven candidates for external origin of a few percent of the uncertainties ) . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "[ cometz ]         + 0.2 in   +    table [ tabclus ] shows the main data for clusters that meet at least one of the criteria for unusual origin and @xmath43 can be expected , but we find these to be well within the uncertainties on our values . ] .",
    "we see that of the 410 clusters initially considered , 35 satisfy at least one criterion .",
    "four satisfy all three criteria for unusual origin : berkeley21 , 32 , 99 , and melotte66 , and here the z@xmath42 versus @xmath43 linear correlation coefficient is 0.97 .",
    "these clusters are aged 2.19 , 3.38 , 3.16 , and 2.78 gyr , respectively , which places them amongst the ten oldest clusters among the set of 369 for which ages are available in daml .",
    "berkeley21 has the highest z@xmath42 and @xmath43 , and its orbit for 15 gyr is thick and wide .",
    "thirteen others have data on metallicity , and of these , four meet two of the criteria , whereas nine meet only one criterion for unusual origin .",
    "we looked for information on cluster masses , but found only eleven clusters for which the mass is available ( durgapal & pandey , 2001 ) , of which only two values are for our set of clusters in table [ tabclus ] .",
    "at least for these , the masses are not atypical in any degree . in daml ,",
    "we find information on actual diameters in pc , but for the clusters in table [ tabclus ] , we find no correlation between these diameters with age or metallicity .    finally , as support evidence , we have calculated the position of the birthplace of clusters which meet all three criteria using a monte carlo method with 2000 realisations .",
    "figure [ mc ] shows the results in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath7 at birth for the four prime candidates for unusual origin . for berkeley21 ,",
    "there is a 92% chance of birth occurring at @xmath44 kpc ( one scale height ) . for berkeley32 ,",
    "this figure is 72% . for berkeley99 ,",
    "there is a 90% chance of birth beyond 0.3 kpc from the disk plane , increasing to 94% if we also require that @xmath7 be less than the visible disk diameter of 15kpc . for melotte66 , these figures are 88% and 92% respectively .",
    "the nominal values of @xmath9 at birth are for berkeley21 2.5kpc , for berkeley32 0.7kpc , for berkeley99 1.8kpc , and for melotte66 1.3kpc ; these are among the ten highest distances from the plane calculated for those in our sample of clusters that also have age data .",
    "in addition we carried out a similar calculation for ngc5316 ( figure [ crown ] ) , and find that all values of @xmath9 at birth lie within the thin disk with a fwhm of 0.4kpc .",
    "we now examine the nature of the unusual origin behind the clusters in table [ tabclus ] by considering the mechanisms that could lead to the formation of open clusters .",
    "we see that most clusters in table [ tabclus ] , and certainly those where at least two criteria are met , exhibit relatively high values of z@xmath42 . for high - altitude clusters such as these , two formation mechanisms have been suggested .",
    "martos , allen , franco & kurtz ( 1999 ) modelled the gas response to the spiral arm density wave and find that the shock sends gas from the inter - arm region to high altitude , followed by star formation , albeit with a low efficiency .",
    "the other mechanism , proposed by de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2008 ) has pre - existing clusters , preferably globular , interacting with high altitude gas clouds , creating enhanced turbulence leading to star formation in sufficiently large clouds .",
    "they further estimate that about 3,000 clusters could have formed in this way over the life of the galaxy .",
    "the above mechanisms could explain most clusters in table [ tabclus ] .",
    "however , we offer further alternative mechanisms for consideration .",
    "firstly , as discussed by friel ( 1995 ) , impact of high velocity clouds on the disk can lead to star formation , a mechanism studied by comern & torra ( 1992 ) , with the cluster retaining some kinetic memory of the event , for example high @xmath9 ( danly , 1992 ) and possibly eccentric orbits .",
    "in addition , wakker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that such high velocity clouds have low metallicities ( @xmath10.1 solar ) , with some of them falling into the galaxy .",
    "these point to the origins of clusters with high z@xmath42 and @xmath43 and low metallicity being formed as a result of an agent of extra - galactic origin : in our case , these would be the top four clusters in table [ tabclus ] , and might also be the case for ngc2158 , 2420 , 7789 , and ic1311 . secondly , globular clusters impacting the disk can cause disk gas compression , either due to gravitational focussing ( initially discussed in wallin , higdon & staveley - smith 1996 , and later in vande putte & cropper , 2009 ) , or shock wave formation ( levy , 2000 ) .",
    "this would produce clusters with a metallicity representative of the disk , and the parameters z@xmath42 and @xmath43 would be the indicators of unusual origin ; in table [ tabclus ] these might be ngc6791 , 1817 , and 7044 .",
    "next , the accretion of satellite galaxies could result in donations of ready - made open clusters with a metallicity higher than that of the high velocity clouds . here too , z@xmath42 and @xmath43 would be diagnostics , because of the cluster retaining kinematic memory of the donor galaxy .",
    "metallicity could also be a diagnostic , but is likely to be higher than that of the high velocity clouds .",
    "finally , clusters could be formed as the result of a merging galaxy , such as within the dwarf sagittarius or the magellanic steams . here",
    "we would expect again high z@xmath42 and @xmath43 and perhaps a higher or similar metallicity .",
    "some unspecified form of merger could be the agent responsible for the last nine clusters in table [ tabclus ] .",
    "clusters originating from these last two mechanisms should be related at least in terms of their integrals of motion to galactic streams and/or to known hi features such as the magellanic stream .    from the literature we find the following non - kinematic studies on the origins of these four clusters and for those we have placed  on hold \" .",
    "concerning our four prime candidates for unusual origin identified by orbit analysis , we find that yong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are unable to reach a conclusion for berkeley21 .",
    "there are no further relevant studies for berkeley32 , 99 , and melotte66 . in the case of the clusters  on hold \" , yong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using high resolution spectroscopy , provide arguments based on age and metallicity to conclude that berkeley29 could be due to a merger , but not berkeley31 .",
    "they are unable to reach a conclusion for berkeley20 or 21 .",
    "carraro & bensby ( 2009 ) reach the same conclusion in respect of berkeley29 , noting that it lies in the dsgr stream .",
    "carraro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conclude that berkeley33 is not of extra - galactic origin , but instead is a genuine galactic cluster .",
    "while some small fraction of currently high galactic altitude clusters could have been born at low altitudes , they would be expected to be of at least moderate metallicity . for our four prime candidates",
    "this is not the case , supporting their origin high above the galactic plane .        .",

    "the daml catalogue of 1787 open clusters provides a large database to study these clusters . in particular , it contains sufficient data to calculate past orbits in as many as 481 cases .",
    "this allowed us to undertake a systematic analysis of these open clusters by examining their orbit morphology .",
    "we found , with few exceptions , that the orbit type , when run for a sufficiently long time , is a crown orbit .",
    "this type of orbit is readily characterised by two parameters : z@xmath42 , the largest separation between cluster and disk in absolute value , and @xmath43 , a measure of orbit eccentricity .",
    "this has first of all revealed four clusters whose proper motion data in the catalogue are open to question , as they may relate instead to foreground associations : they do nt exhibit a crown orbit , and one of them counter rotates .",
