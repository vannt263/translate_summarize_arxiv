    "the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) is the next nasa general gamma - ray astrophysics mission , which is scheduled to be launched into low earth orbit in february , 2007 , for 510 years of operation .",
    "it will consist of two instruments : the large area telescope ( lat ) and the glast burst monitor ( gbm ) . a product of a nasa / doe / international collaboration",
    ", the lat will be a pair conversion telescope covering the @xmath020  mev to @xmath1300  gev energy band",
    ". the lat will be @xmath230 times more sensitive than _",
    "cgro s _ egret .",
    "the gbm will detect and localize bursts , and extend glast s burst spectral sensitivity to the @xmath010  kev to @xmath125  mev band . consisting of 12 nai(tl ) ( 101000  kev ) and 2 bgo ( 0.1525  mev ) detectors",
    ", the gbm will monitor @xmath18  sr of the sky , including the lat s field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "bursts will be localized to @xmath3 ( 1@xmath4 ) by comparing the rates in different detectors .    during most of the mission glast",
    "will survey the sky by rocking @xmath5 above and below the orbital plane around the zenith direction once per orbit .",
    "the first year will be devoted to a sky survey while the instrument teams calibrate their instruments . during subsequent years",
    "guest investigators may propose pointed observations , but continued survey mode is anticipated because it will usually be most efficient .    both the gbm and the lat will have burst triggers . when either instrument triggers , a notice with a preliminary localization will be sent to the ground through tdrss and then disseminated by gcn .",
    "additional data will be sent down through tdrss for an improved rapid localization on the ground .",
    "`` final '' positions will be calculated from the full downlinked data .",
    "all positions will be disseminated as gcn notices , and additional information ( e.g. , fluences and durations ) will be sent out as gcn circulars .",
    "using its own and the gbm s observations , the lat will decide autonomously whether to slew to the burst location for a 5  hour followup pointed observation .",
    "the threshold will be higher for gbm - detected bursts outside the lat s fov .",
    "the gbm s nai and bgo detectors will provide the number of counts detected in 8  energy bands every 16  ms ; the gbm will trigger off these rates .",
    "rate triggers test whether the increase in the number of counts in an energy band @xmath6 and time bin @xmath7 is statistically significant ; the expected number of non - burst photons in the @xmath6@xmath7 bin is estimated by accumulating counts before the time bin being tested . building on our experience with the batse trigger , we are performing trade studies to optimize the sensitivity of these triggers . here",
    "we present the results of our studies focusing on the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "we consider two @xmath7 hierarchies@xmath7 spaced by factors of @xmath102 ( e.g. , 16 ms , 32 ms , 64 ms ... ) or @xmath104 ( e.g. , 16 ms , 64 ms , 256 ms ... )and three time bin registrations  non - overlapping bins ( e.g. , bins separated by 1024 ms for @xmath7=1024 ms bins ) , half - step bins ( e.g. , bins separated by 512 ms for @xmath11=1024  ms bins ) , and all possible bins ( e.g. , bins every 16  ms ) .",
    "varying @xmath7 can maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , while more time registrations permit the bin to be centered over the peak flux , also maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio . to test these 6 triggers",
    "we applied them to the 64  ms resolution lightcurves of the 25 brightest batse bursts ; for each lightcurve we chose 10 starting times at random . note that the gbm rates will have 16  ms resolution .",
    "the most sensitive trigger would have @xmath7 spaced by @xmath102 and every possible time bin .",
    "the next most sensitive trigger would have @xmath7 spaced by @xmath102 and bins spaced every half step .",
    "these triggers would test different numbers of bins11264 bins vs. 3070 bins tested every 16.384  s.    besides the increased computational burden , the risk of a false trigger increases as the number of bins tested increases , but the false trigger probability is not proportional to the number of bins because the bins are not independent .",
    "our simulations indicate this is a @xmath05% effect  for the same false trigger rate the trigger threshold should be raised by a few percent as the number of time bins tested increases .",
    "triggering on the counts accumulated in different @xmath6 can tailor the detector sensitivity to hard or soft bursts .",
    "the gbm will be able to trigger on more than one @xmath8 , and therefore we seek the set that will maximize the sensitivity for both hard and soft bursts , although hard bursts are a priority since their spectra are more likely to extend into the lat s energy band ( of course one must be careful of one s theoretical prejudices ) . for the study of detector sensitivity to different types of bursts and for comparisons between detectors ,",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane is useful@xcite , where @xmath12 is the peak photon flux in a fiducial energy band ( here 11000  kev ) and @xmath13 is the energy of the peak of @xmath14 .",
    "burst spectra are also characterized by asymptotic low and high energy power laws with spectral indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ; the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath15 and @xmath16 is not as great as on @xmath13 . for a given set of spectral indices",
    "the detector sensitivity ( the threshold value of @xmath12 at a give @xmath13 ) is a curve in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane .    to calculate these sensitivity curves",
    "we need both the number of counts a detector will detect in the nominal @xmath8 band for a given burst spectrum and the number of background counts in this @xmath8 . a code has been developed to calculate these numbers for each gbm detector for a burst in any direction relative to the spacecraft .",
    "currently the code uses response matrices for the flux directly incident on the detectors ( without scattering off the spacecraft or the earth , but with obscuration by other parts of the observatory ) , and a model of the background on orbit .",
    "we used this code to calculate the sensitivity along the normal to the lat for @xmath7=1.024 s assuming at least two detectors trigger at @xmath17 .",
    "we calculated the sensitivity curves for a variety of @xmath8 .",
    "the extremes of our spectral index sets were @xmath15=0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the first set is similar to the spectra sometimes observed early in a burst ; its high energy tail would be more easily detected by the lat .",
    "the second set is a spectrum without a high energy tail .     for @xmath15=0 , @xmath18 ( left plot ) and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( right plot ) .",
    "the solid curves are for ( left to right within plot ) @xmath8=5100 , 50300 and 1001000  kev and the dashed for @xmath8=51000 and 501000  kev .",
    "lower curves are more sensitive.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath15=0 , @xmath18 ( left plot ) and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( right plot ) .",
    "the solid curves are for ( left to right within plot ) @xmath8=5100 , 50300 and 1001000  kev and the dashed for @xmath8=51000 and 501000  kev .",
    "lower curves are more sensitive.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  1 shows the sensitivity for two sets of @xmath8 . to compare the gbm and batse burst distributions we would like to include @xmath8=50300  kev , which was batse s primary trigger band .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath8 with a low energy cutoff of @xmath250  kev is optimal for high energy sensitivity because it does not include the large low energy background .",
    "conversely , @xmath8 should always extend to the highest energy possible because of the low background at high energy .",
    "we find that triggering a single bgo detector with @xmath21 increases the sensitivity for @xmath22  mev for @xmath15=0 , @xmath18 .",
    "there is no increase in sensitivity for @xmath23 .",
    "figure  2 compares the @xmath7=1  s sensitivity for the gbm ( solid ) and batse ( dot - dashed ) with the burst intensity ( dashed ) that when the spectrum is extrapolated to the lat energy band would result in 25  detected photons per second .",
    "the burst is assumed to be on the lat normal , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and the gbm triggers on @xmath8=5100 and 50300  kev .",
    "the @xmath7 calculations suggest that spacing @xmath7 by factors of @xmath102 ( i.e. , 16  ms , 32  ms , 64  ms ... ) and staggering the bins by half a timestep ( e.g. , the 1024  ms bins are accumulated every 512  ms ) would be particularly efficient given the number of time bins that would be tested . choosing two triggers with @xmath8 starting at 5  kev and 50  kev and extending to the detector s high energy cutoff would provide good high and low energy sensitivity . using @xmath8=50300  kev would reproduce the batse trigger , but would reduce the @xmath24500  kev sensitivity for the hardest bursts ( which are more likely to have lat flux ) ;",
    "this can be mitigated by adding @xmath6=1001000  kev .",
    "future trade studies will focus on the methodology for measuring the background .",
    "glast will slew more frequently than _ cgro _ did , and therefore the background rates in glast s different detectors will probably vary more rapidly .",
    "we will need to suppress spurious triggers resulting from variations in the background without a major reduction in the gbm s sensitivity ."
