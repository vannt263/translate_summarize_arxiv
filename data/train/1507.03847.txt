    "with the more and more observational data available from far sky , the need for a change in the standard cosmological paradigm becomes inevitable .",
    "prior to 1998 when we had no idea about the accelerating mode of expansion the available observational data were well fit in the standard einstein model .",
    "but the discovery and further reconfirmation of the existence of the late time accelerated mode of expansion @xcite have opened a new window for change . along with",
    "that comes out a number of alternative models of the evolution of the universe .",
    "the most popular among the models are those which consider the old einstein theory with a new `` matter '' as a source field . the models with @xmath1-term @xcite , quintessence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite etc .",
    "are among the most studied ones , though some other models of dark energy are also proposed . after some remarkable works by different authors",
    "@xcite , showing the important role of spinor field in the evolution of the universe , it has been extensively used to model the dark energy .",
    "this success is directly related to its ability to answer some fundamental questions of modern cosmology : ( i ) problem of initial singularity and its possible elimination @xcite ; ( ii ) problem of isotropization @xcite and ( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover recently it was found that the spinor field can also describe the different characteristics of matter from ekpyrotic matter to phantom matter , as well as chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that in earlier works only the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field were taken into account .",
    "but recently it was shown that due to its specific behavior in curve spacetime the spinor field can significantly change not only the geometry of spacetime but itself as well . the existence of nontrivial non - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor plays a vital role in this matter . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that depending on the type restriction imposed on the non - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor , the initially bianchi type - i evolves into a lrs bianchi type - i spacetime or frw one from the very beginning , whereas the model may describe a general bianchi type - i spacetime but in that case the spinor field becomes massless and linear .",
    "the same thing happens for a bianchi type-@xmath0 spacetime , i.e. , the geometry of bianchi type-@xmath0 spacetime does not allow the existence of a massive and/or nonlinear spinor field @xcite .",
    "anisotropic bianchi type vi cosmological models were studied by many authors @xcite . in this report",
    "we study the role of spinor field in the evolution of a bianchi type vi anisotropic cosmological model .",
    "let us consider the case when the anisotropic space - time is filled with nonlinear spinor field .",
    "the corresponding action can be given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 here @xmath4 corresponds to the gravitational field @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature , @xmath7 , with g being einstein s gravitational constant and @xmath8 is the spinor field lagrangian .",

    "the above analysis shows that the absence of mass term leads to constant deceleration parameter , while for a time depending deceleration parameter the presence of a non - zero mass term is essential .",
    "let us also see what happens to eos ( equation of state ) parameter in this case . inserting into and one finds the expressions for energy density @xmath228 and pressure @xmath229 ( in this particular case as @xmath230 ) :    @xmath231    in view of for the eos parameter we find    @xmath232    it can be shown that at the early stage of evolution the eos parameter is dominated by the usual matter , while at later stage the dark energy becomes dominant .",
    "moreover , at the absence of the mass term the eos parameter becomes a constant as in that case @xmath233 , whereas for a non - trivial mass term the eos parameter is a variable function of time .",
    "here we have exploited the fact that , at any concrete stage of evolution , one of the terms of the sum becomes predominant ; hence others can be overlooked",
    ".    there might be some question regarding the choice of nonlinearity in the form .",
    "the reason lies on the fact that the spinor description of different kinds of fluid and dark energy such as ekpyrotic matter , dust , radiation , quintessence , chaplygin gas , phantom matter etc .",
    "is in one form or the other is given by the power law of the invariants of spinor field .",
    "while the spinor description of fluid or dark energy leads to the elimination of mass term , the choice still allows us to study the role of spinor mass on the evolution of the universe . to show this",
    "let us recall that only in case of @xmath234 we could express @xmath32 in terms of @xmath118 with a non - trivial mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "so setting @xmath235 from @xmath236 in view of and one finds @xcite @xmath237 that corresponds to dust ( @xmath238 ) , radiation ( @xmath239 ) , hard universe ( @xmath240 ) , stiff matter ( @xmath241 ) , quintessence ( @xmath242),cosmological constant ( @xmath243 ) , phantom matter ( @xmath244 ) , and ekpyrotic matter ( @xmath245 ) , respectively . inserting into one",

    "we find @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively .",
    "eos parameter in this case is a constant by definition , while in absence of the mass term the deceleration parameter also becomes a constant .",
    "nevertheless one can use with the trivial mass term in the lagrangian and the sum ( @xmath248 ) in can be viewed as multi - component source field with @xmath249 standing for different types of matter and dark energy such as ekpyrotic matter , dust , radiation , quintessence , chaplygin gas , phantom matter etc .",
    "comparing with one finds @xmath250 . further setting the value of @xmath251 for different fluid and dark energy we find the corresponding value of @xmath252 : dust ( @xmath253 ) , radiation ( @xmath254 ) , hard universe ( @xmath255 ) , stiff matter ( @xmath256 ) , quintessence ( @xmath257),cosmological constant ( @xmath258 ) , phantom matter ( @xmath259 ) , and ekpyrotic matter ( @xmath260 ) , respectively .",
    "it was shown earlier , when @xmath261 the corresponding term can be added to the mass term .",
    "so we can conclude that the term with @xmath261 which also describes dust behaves like a mass term .",
    "one of the principal advantage of using spinor description of source field lies on the fact that in this case one needs not think about whether two or more components considered can be separated . to show that let us write the biacnhi identity that leads to    @xmath262    which for the metric on account of the components of the energy - momentum tensor takes the from @xmath263 inserting @xmath264 and @xmath265 from and from one finds    @xmath266    in case of @xmath234 fulfills identically thanks to , i.e. , @xmath267 and @xmath268 , whereas in the case when @xmath32 takes one of the following expressions @xmath125 , for a massless spinor field fulfills identically thanks to , and , i.e. , @xmath268 hence if we use spinor description of different fluid and dark energy simulated from corresponding equation of sate , the bianchi identity will be fulfilled identically without invoking any additional condition .    to this end",
