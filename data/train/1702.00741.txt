    "with a laurent series @xmath2 with complex coefficients @xmath3 , one can associate a semi - infinite toeplitz matrix @xmath4 whose elements are given by @xmath5 in the theory of toeplitz matrices , @xmath6 is referred to as the symbol of @xmath4 . according to what properties of @xmath4 are of interest , the class of symbols is usually further restricted .",
    "for the spectral analysis of @xmath4 , the special role is played by the wiener algebra which consists of symbols @xmath6 defined on the unit circle @xmath7 whose laurent series   is absolutely convergent for @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is a bounded operator on the banach space @xmath9 , for any @xmath10 , and its spectral properties are well - known , see @xcite .    rather than actual spectrum of @xmath4 , this paper focuses on an asymptotic spectrum of @xmath4 , meaning the set of all limit points of eigenvalues of matrices @xmath11 , as @xmath12 , where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath13 principal submatrix of @xmath4 . an intimately related subject concerns the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of toeplitz matrices for which the most complete results were obtained if the symbol of the matrix is a laurent polynomial .",
    "more precisely , one considers symbols of the form @xmath14 for which the toeplitz matrix @xmath15 is banded and is not lower or upper triangular .",
    "this subject has an impressive history going a century back to the famous work of szeg on the asymptotic behavior of the determinant of @xmath16 for @xmath12 .",
    "the most essential progress was achieved by schmidt and spitzer @xcite who proved that the eigenvalue - counting measures @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the eigenvalues of @xmath16 ( repeated according to their algebraic multiplicity ) and @xmath19 the dirac measure supported at @xmath20 , converge weakly to a _ limiting measure _ @xmath21 , as @xmath12 . recall that @xmath22 converges weakly to @xmath21 , as @xmath23 , if and only if @xmath24 for every bounded and continuous function @xmath25 on @xmath26 .",
    "the measure @xmath21 is supported on the _ limiting set _ @xmath27 the limit which appears above exists , see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , schmidt and spitzer derived another very useful description of @xmath28 which reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 are ( not necessarily distinct ) roots of the polynomial @xmath31 arranged in the order of increase of their absolute values , i.e. , @xmath32 ( if there is a chain of equalities above , then the labeling of roots within this chain is arbitrary . )",
    "the latter description allows to deduce the fundamental analytical and topological properties of @xmath28 .",
    "first , the set @xmath28 equals the union of a finite number of pairwise disjoint open analytic arcs and a finite number of the so - called exceptional points .",
    "a point @xmath33 is called _ exceptional _ , if either @xmath34 is a branch point , i.e. , if the polynomial @xmath31 has a multiple root , or if there is no open neighborhood @xmath35 of @xmath34 such that @xmath36 is an analytic arc starting and terminating on the boundary @xmath37 .",
    "second , @xmath28 is a compact and connected set , see @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that @xmath21 is absolutely continuous with respect to the arclength measure in @xmath26 and its density has been derived by hirschmann @xcite .    as a starting point , we focus on a characterization of laurent polynomial symbols @xmath38 for which @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath38 _ belongs to the class _ @xmath40 ; see definition  [ def : class_r ] . besides all the symbols @xmath38 for which @xmath15 is self - adjoint",
    ", the class @xmath40 contains also symbols of certain non - self - adjoint matrices .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that , for @xmath41 , the spectra of all submatrices @xmath16 are real ; see theorem  [ thm : summary ] below .    describing the class @xmath40 can be viewed as a problem of characterization of the subclass of banded toeplitz matrices with asymptotically real spectrum .",
    "let us point out that , in this context , the consideration of the set of the limit spectral points , i.e. @xmath28 , is a more relevant and interesting problem than the study of the spectrum of @xmath15 realized as an operator acting on @xmath9 , for some @xmath10 . indeed , note that @xmath15 is self - adjoint if and only if @xmath42 where @xmath7 is the unit circle .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath43 coincides with the essential spectrum of @xmath15 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor .  1.10 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath15 is non - self - adjoint , then there is no chance for @xmath44 to be purely real .    from a broader perspective , results of the present paper contribute to the study of the spectral properties of non - self - adjoint operators ; a rapidly developing area which has recently attracted attention of many mathematicians and physicists , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "particularly noteworthy problem consists in finding classes of non - self - adjoint operators that have purely real spectrum . this is usually a mathematically challenging problem ( see , for example ,",
    "the proof of reality of the spectrum of the imaginary cubic oscillator in  @xcite ) which , in addition , may be of physical relevance . at the moment ,",
    "the non - self - adjoint operators whose spectrum is known to be real mainly comprise either very specific operators @xcite or operators which are in a certain sense close to being self - adjoint @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are almost no criteria for famous non - self - adjoint families ( such as toeplitz , jacobi , hankel , schrdinger , etc . ) guaranteeing the reality of their spectra . from this point of view and to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the present article provides the first relevant results of such a flavor for the class of banded toeplitz matrices .",
    "our main result is the following characterization of the class @xmath40 .",
    "[ thm : summary ] let @xmath38 be a complex laurent polynomial as in  .",
    "the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath39 ; 2 .",
    "the set @xmath45 contains ( an image of ) a jordan curve ; 3 .   for all @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "it is a very peculiar feature of banded toeplitz matrices that the asymptotic reality of the eigenvalues ( claim ( i ) ) forces all eigenvalues of all submatrices to be real ( claim ( iii ) ) .",
    "hence , if , for instance , the @xmath48 matrix @xmath49 has a non - real eigenvalue , there is no chance for the limiting set @xmath28 to be real .",
    "the implication ( iii)@xmath50(i ) is clearly trivial . the implication ( i)@xmath50(ii )",
    "is proven in theorem  [ thm : main_neces ] , while ( ii)@xmath50(iii ) is established in theorem  [ thm : gamma_impl_real_spec ] for even more general class of symbols .",
    "these results are worked out within the first subsection of section  [ sec : main ] .",
    "the second subsection of section  [ sec : main ] primarily studies the density of the limiting measure @xmath21 for real laurent polynomial symbols @xmath41 in more detail .",
    "namely , we provide an explicit description of the density of @xmath21 in terms of the symbol @xmath38 and the jordan curve present in @xmath45 provided that the curve admits a polar parametrization .",
    "second , we show that the limiting measure is a solution of a particular hamburger moment problem whose moment sequence is determined by the symbol @xmath41 .",
    "the positive definiteness of the moment hankel matrix then provides a necessary ( algebraic ) condition for @xmath38 to belong to @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we prove an integral formula for the determinant of the moment hankel matrix and discuss the possible sufficiency of the condition of positive definiteness of the hankel moment matrices for @xmath38 to belong to @xmath40 .    since , for @xmath41 , the support of @xmath21 is real and bounded , there is a unique self - adjoint bounded jacobi operator @xmath51 whose spectral measure coincides with the limiting measure",
    ". some properties of @xmath51 and the corresponding family of orthogonal polynomials are investigated in section  [ sec : jac_op ] .",
    "mainly , we prove that @xmath51 is a compact perturbation of a jacobi operator with constant diagonal and off - diagonal sequences .",
    "also the weyl @xmath52-function of @xmath51 is expressed in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "section  [ sec : ex_numer ] provides several concrete examples and numerical computations illustrating the results of sections  [ sec : main ] and  [ sec : jac_op ] . for general @xmath53-diagonal and 4-diagonal toeplitz matrices",
    "@xmath15 , explicit conditions in terms of @xmath38 guaranteeing that @xmath41 are deduced .",
    "further , for the @xmath53-diagonal and slightly specialized 4-diagonal toeplitz matrices , the densities of the limiting measures as well as the associated jacobi matrices are obtained fully explicitly .",
    "moreover , we show that the corresponding orthogonal polynomials are related to certain well - known families of orthogonal polynomials , which involve chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and the associated jacobi polynomials .",
    "their properties such as the three - term recurrence , the orthogonality relation , and an explicit representation are given .",
    "yet for another interesting example generalizing the previous two , we are able to obtain some partial results .",
    "these examples are presented in subsections  [ subsec : ex1 ] , [ subsec : ex2 ] , and  [ subsec : ex3 ] .",
    "finally , the last part of the paper contains various numerical illustrations and plots of the densities of the limiting measures and the distributions of eigenvalues in the situations whose complexity does not allow us to treat them explicitly .",
    "[ def : class_r ] laurent polynomial @xmath38 of the form   is said to _ belong to the class @xmath40 _ , denoted by @xmath41 , if and only if @xmath39 , where @xmath28 is given by  .",
    "since @xmath28 is a compact connected set , the inclusion @xmath39 actually implies that @xmath28 is a closed finite interval .",
    "we start with the proof of the implication ( i)@xmath50(ii ) from theorem  [ thm : summary ] . for this purpose , we take a closer look at the structure of the set @xmath45 where the symbol is real - valued .",

    "consequently , @xmath45 is a finite union of pairwise disjoint open analytic arcs , i.e. , images of analytic mappings from open intervals to @xmath26 , and a finite number of branching points which are the critical points of @xmath38",
    ".    it might be convenient to add the points @xmath61 and @xmath0 to @xmath45 and introduce the set @xmath62 endowed with the topology induced from the riemann sphere @xmath63 .",
    "observe that the set @xmath64 coincides with the so - called _ net of the rational function _",
    "@xmath38 , cf .",
    "@xcite . recall that @xmath64 is a closed subset of @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , @xmath64 contains neither isolated points nor curves with end - points ( i.e. , @xmath65 such that there is no open neighborhood @xmath35 of @xmath66 such that @xmath67 is an analytic arc starting and terminating on @xmath37 ) , as one verifies by using general principles ( the mean - value property for harmonic functions and the open mapping theorem ) .    in total",
    ", @xmath64 is a finite union of jordan curves in @xmath63 of which at most one is entirely located in @xmath1 . indeed , assuming the opposite of the latter claim , one can always find a region ( an open connected set ) in @xmath1 such that @xmath38 has real values on its boundary .",
    "recall that , if @xmath25 is a function analytic in a region @xmath68 , continuous up to the boundary @xmath69 , and real on the boundary , then @xmath25 is a ( real ) constant on @xmath70 , as one deduces by using the maximum modulus principle and the open mapping theorem .",
    "thus one concludes that under this assumption there exists a non - empty region on which @xmath38 is a constant function , a contradiction .",
    "note that , if the jordan curve in @xmath45 is present , it contains @xmath61 in its interior .",
    "notice also that , since @xmath71 , as @xmath72 , @xmath64 looks locally at @xmath61 as a star graph with @xmath73 edges and the angle between two consecutive edges is @xmath74 .",

    "let us point out that , besides the cases @xmath251 and either @xmath252 or @xmath352 , one can also derive explicitly the density for the self - adjoint 5-diagonal case , i.e. @xmath425 ( @xmath387 ) .",

    "derivation of a closed formula for the sequences @xmath300 and @xmath301 determining the jacobi operator @xmath51 for general values of @xmath93 and @xmath95 , seems to be out of our reach . even a closed expression for the determinant of the hankel matrix @xmath215 determined by the sequences @xmath431 corresponding to the special cases with @xmath387 , @xmath251 and @xmath432 or @xmath433 and @xmath352 , respectively , is unknown , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "in fact , numerical experiments with the sequence of these determinants show a presence of huge prime factors which might indicate that no closed formula , similar to  , exists for the hankel determinants .",

    "most of the results of this paper are devoted to banded toeplitz matrices but theorem  [ thm : gamma_impl_real_spec ] is applicable to matrices with more general symbols .",
    "a combination of the previous example with the symbol and theorem  [ thm : gamma_impl_real_spec ] provides us with more examples of possibly non - self - adjoint toeplitz matrices given by a more general symbol .",

    "consequently , @xmath437 for all @xmath46 . to be even more concrete ,",
    "the possible choices of @xmath25 comprise , e.g. , @xmath438 , producing many examples of non - self - adjoint and non - banded toeplitz matrices whose principal submatrices have purely real spectrum .      to illustrate a computational applicability of theorems  [ thm : main_suff_generalized ] and  [ thm : main_suff ] , we add two more complicated examples treated numerically using wolfram mathematica . in particular , to emphasize the connection between the existence of a jordan curve in @xmath45 and the reality of the limiting set of eigenvalues of the corresponding toeplitz matrices , we provide some numerical plots on this account .",
    "we plot the numerically obtained density by applying theorem  [ thm : main_suff ] to the symbol @xmath439 whose net is shown in figure  [ fig : net_illust_yes_no ] ( left ) .",
    "although we can only check the validity of the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : main_suff ] numerically , looking at figure  [ fig : net_illust_yes_no ] it is reasonable to believe the jordan curve present in @xmath45 can be parametrized by polar coordinates .",
    "further , a numerical computation indicates that no critical point of @xmath38 lies on the jordan curve in the upper half - plane .",
    "the real critical points of @xmath38 closest to the origin are @xmath440 and @xmath441 and the corresponding critical values are @xmath442 and @xmath443 .",

    "the density of @xmath21 is plotted in figure  [ fig : density_ex4 ] .      for an illustration of theorem  [ thm : main_suff_generalized ] which allows to have non - real critical points of  @xmath38 on the arc of jordan curve in @xmath45",
    ", we consider the symbol @xmath445 the corresponding toeplitz matrix @xmath15 is self - adjoint and hence the jordan curve in @xmath45 is the unit circle .",
    "the function @xmath38 has two critical points with positive imaginary part on the unit circle , namely @xmath446 and the corresponding values are @xmath447 see figure [ fig : net_ex5 ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main_suff_generalized ] tells us that each arc of the unit circle between two critical points gives rise to a measure .",
    "labeling the measures in agreement with theorem  [ thm : main_suff_generalized ] ( starting at @xmath98 and traversing the arcs of the unit circle in the counterclockwise direction ) we get measures @xmath448 , @xmath449 , and @xmath450 , which , since @xmath451 and @xmath452 , are supported approximately on the intervals @xmath453 $ ] , @xmath454 $ ] , and @xmath455 $ ] , respectively .",

    "the graph of the density of @xmath21 suggests that the eigenvalues of @xmath16 cluster with higher density to the left of the point @xmath457 which has also been observed numerically , see figure  [ fig : eigen_plot_ex5 ] .",
    "our final plots are devoted to an illustration of the connection between the presence of a jordan curve in @xmath45 and the reality of @xmath28 .",
    "we go back to the example  4 once again and introduce an additional parameter @xmath458 at @xmath459 getting the symbol @xmath460    in figure  [ fig : break_ex ] , it is shown that , as the parameter @xmath358 increases from @xmath461 to @xmath462 , the jordan curve in @xmath45 gets `` destroyed '' by an incoming curve from the net of @xmath38 . at the same time , @xmath28 changes from a real interval to a set with non - real values .",
