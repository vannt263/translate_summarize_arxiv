    "akari is the japanese infrared satellite launched on february 21 , 2006 @xcite .",
    "the satellite is equipped with a 68.5-cm telescope and two focal plane instruments .",
    "these assemblies are cryogenically cooled by liquid helium and mechanical cryocoolers @xcite .",
    "one of the focal plane instruments is the infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) , which is dedicated to imaging and spectroscopic observations in the near- and mid - infrared wavelength regions .",
    "the main purpose of the akari mission is to carry out an all - sky survey .",
    "in addition to the all - sky survey observations , a number of pointing observations have been carried out with the irc .",
    "the irc comprises three channels , each of which covers a different wavelength range : nir ( 1.85.5 ) , mir - s ( 4.613.4 ) , and mir - l ( 12.626.5 ) . a prism ( np ) and a grism ( ng )",
    "are equipped with the nir channel for spectroscopy .",
    "the grism mode covers the 2.55.0  range with a spectral resolving power ( @xmath0 ) of 120 at 3.6 , whereas the prism mode is 1.85.5  with lower resolution of @xmath1 at 3.5  @xcite .",
    "the nir spectroscopy is one of the unique capabilities of akari because continuous coverage in this wavelength range can not be achieved by ground - based telescopes owing to atmospheric absorption .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ; @xcite ) is also capable of near - infrared spectroscopy but its observations are limited to bright sources .",
    "the sensitivities of iso and akari are on the order of a few jy and a few mjy , respectively . the infrared spectrometer ( irs ) onboard the spitzer space telescope observes wavelengths longer than 5.2  @xcite .",
    "the irc team has developed and distributed the idl - based data reduction package `` irc spectroscopy toolkit '' at the akari website .",
    "the toolkit extracts a spectral image for each source after the basic data reduction ( dark subtraction , linearity correction , flat fielding , stacking , etc . ) . for each spectral image",
    ", the toolkit converts the pixel positions along the dispersion direction to wavelengths and divides the outputs by the spectral response ( the output per the unit flux density at each wavelength ) .",
    "the one - dimensional calibrated spectrum is obtained by summing up the image along the spatial axis @xcite .",
    "`` akari irc data user manual for post - helium ( phase 3 ) mission version 1.1 '' states that the second - order light diffracted by the grism overlaps with the first - order light of wavelengths longer than 4.9 .",
    "previous spectral response calibrations of the grism mode performed by @xcite and t. shimonishi are based on observations of a- and k - type standard stars .",
    "these stars have blue spectra ; in other words , their fluxes are larger at shorter wavelengths .",
    "consequently , the intensity of the contaminating second - order light increases relative to that of the first - order light at longer wavelengths . observed signals for 4.95.0  are therefore vulnerable to second - order light and , hence , the spectral response in this wavelength range produces erroneous flux values particularly for red objects , which have less contamination from the second - order light .",
    "previous flux calibrations neglected this contamination effect .",
    "the wavelength range contaminated by the second - order light is important for some features , such as the carbon monoxide fundamental ro - vibrational absorption bands ( around at 4.7 ) .",
    "for instance , such absorption bands can be used to probe the physical conditions of molecular clouds surrounding active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , as investigated by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to analyze the absorption from the grism mode spectra unless the contamination is corrected properly .    in this paper , we quantify and correct for the contamination of the second - order light in the irc grism spectroscopy . in section [ sec .",

    "a grism is a prism combined with a transmission diffraction grating designed so that a ray of specific wavelength passes straight through . with the help of the diffraction grating ,",
    "the grism has higher spectral resolving power than the prism , but at the same time , it produces higher order interference . in simple grating spectroscopy , the observing wavelength range is limited within an octave .",
    "an order - sorting filter is generally used to prevent overlap between light of different orders .",
    "the situation is more complex in the case of grism spectroscopy .",
    "the optical path difference within a grism depends on the refractive index of its material .",
    "owing to the wavelength dependence of the refractive index , the second - order light can contaminate the first - order spectrum even if the order - sorting filter works perfectly .",
    "we therefore review the design of the irc nir channel and the grism considering this effect .    according to the astro - f interim report volume 2 @xcite ,",
    "the light that enters the nir channel is first collimated by three lenses , diffracted by the grism mounted on the filter wheel , and focused by the plano - convex camera lens on the detector array .",

    "design_ng ] shows a schematic of the nir channel and key parameters .",
    "@xcite give a more detailed layout including the fore - optics .",
    "the spacing between the grism and the plano - convex lens is 27.7 mm .",
    "this lens is 6.5-mm thick and made of silicon . since the refractive index of silicon is 3.4 in the wavelength range of the grism mode @xcite , the second principal plane of the plano - convex lens is located @xmath2 in front of its rear surface .",
    "the designed interval between the lens and the focal plane is 60 mm .",
    "note that the actual in - flight interval between them may not be equal to this value because the focal position is optimized for low - temperature operation by slightly rearranging the optical elements .",
    "the report does not provide the in - flight value .",
    "thus , we assume the design value of 60 mm for the interval as a first approximation .",

    "moreover , the cut - off coating is not perfect and , in practice , there is leakage .",
    "contamination by second - order light can occur even at wavelengths shorter than 5.0 .",
    "the field - of - view of the nir channel consists of four sections , each of which has a respective observational purpose .",
    "these sections are composed of two slits and two square - shaped apertures , which are shown in figure [ fig .",
    "the wider slit is named ns and the narrower one is named nh .",
    "the width of the ns and nh slits are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these slits are designed for observing extended sources . in the larger aperture ( nc ) , multi - object slit - less spectroscopy and imaging observations can be performed .",
    "the smaller aperture ( np ) is equipped to observe a point source avoiding overlaps with other sources .",
    "this aperture has size of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the design of the grism mode does not precisely consider the wavelength dependence of the refractive index of the grism .",
    "the wavelength dependence can cause the contamination of the second - order light and must be considered in the flux calibration .",
    "the refractive index also depends on the temperature as well as the wavelength . in this paper , we focus on observations before the exhaustion of liquid helium ( phases 1 and 2 ) , when the temperature of the nir channel was stable . similar calibrations for the post - helium phase ( phase 3 ) will be conducted in the future .",
    "in this section , based on observations of objects that show several emission lines , we revise the relation between the pixel offset and the wavelength for the grism mode using the equations described in the previous section and considering the refractive index as a function of the wavelength .",
    "in addition to the relation for the first - order light , we also calculate the relation for the second - order light to identify the spectral range where the contamination occurs .    the wavelength - dependent refractive index @xmath22 of ge was measured at cryogenic temperatures by @xcite , and they give it as a function of wavelength and temperature in the range of 1.95.5  and 20300k .",
    "the nir channel was cooled down to @xmath23 during phases 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the function provided by @xcite to lower temperatures suggests that the temperature dependence of the refractive index between 6 and 20k is negligibly small ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we use @xmath22 at 20k as the operating refractive index of the grism in the following analysis .    the previous calibration expressed in equation ( [ eq .",

    "the relations among the components of the first- and second - order light and the output can be formalized in one equation with the response matrix , whose diagonal and off - diagonal elements represent the responses from the first- and second - order light , respectively .",
    "the flux calibration that considers the contamination effect can be achieved by multiplying the inverse matrix of the response with the output .",
    "we here demonstrate the matrix - formulated flux calibration for two objects that have different colors and compare the results with those from the toolkit . in the following demonstrations , the response from the first - order light is interpolated into the pah - masked range using a quadratic function of the wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig .",
    "demo_red ] shows the spectrum of an ulirg ( iras f15002 + 4945 ) with the new calibration matrix .",
    "this ulirg has a red spectrum , and hence , the component of the second - order light is expected to be relatively smaller than that of the blue objects .",
    "the spectrum calculated using the new flux calibration shows a smooth distribution up to 5.0 , whereas that obtained by the toolkit decreases from 4.9  to 5.0 .",
    "this difference stems from that of the current and previous responses from the first - order light .",
    "the current response monotonically decreases at around 4.9 , whereas the previous one increases at the same point ( see figure [ fig .",
    "responses](b ) ) .        as another example , figure [ fig .",
    "demo_blue ] shows the result for an a0v star ( hd 40624 ) , which has a blue spectrum . in this case",
    ", the first - order spectrum at longer wavelengths is assumed to be largely contaminated by the second - order light that comes from shorter wavelengths .",
    "this star was also observed in the prism mode just before the grism mode observation .",
    "since the prism is not a grating element , any problems associated with the higher order light can not occur in the prism mode .",
    "the flux calibration results basically agree with the prism mode spectrum but disagree with it if the off - diagonal elements of the response matrix , which measure the contribution of the second - order light , are ignored .",
    "this suggests that our flux calibration successfully removes the second - order component .",
    "the toolkit has not been able to correct the second - order light contamination of the first - order spectra in wavelengths longer than 4.9 .",
    "this biases the flux calibration , especially for red objects , and prevents obtaining accurate spectra in this wavelength range .",
    "the new flux calibration , which quantifies and subtracts the contamination , can resolve this problem for a wide range of objects , as shown by the above examples .",
    "now we can accurately obtain the 4.95.0  spectra without the effect of the second - order light .",
    "this allows the study of the spectral features of red objects that appear in this wavelength range , such as the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby agns from the akari grism mode spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite reported that three ulirgs observed in phases 1 and 2 by the grism mode show the co absorption feature .",
    "however , these absorption spectra are significantly affected by the second - order contamination and have never been analyzed to date .",
    "moreover , ocs ice absorption ( 4.9 ) falls into the extended wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the ocs ice can be used to study the evolution of circumstellar disks of young stellar objects .",
    "for instance , @xcite tentatively detected the ocs ice absorption toward a low - mass young stellar object irc - l1041 - 2 from the grism mode observation . to study this feature in young stellar objects ,",
    "the effect of the contamination needs to be corrected .",
    "in this paper , we revise the calibrations of the akari irc grism mode spectroscopy by subtracting the second - order light that contaminates the first - order spectrum .",
    "first , the refractive index of ge , the material of which the grism is made , is taken as a function of the wavelength .",
    "the difference from the previous linear wavelength calibration is measured from the recombination lines of planetary nebulae , and we successfully explain it by the wavelength dependence of the refractive index .",
    "next , the spectral responses from the first- and second - order light are simultaneously obtained with standard objects that show contrastive red and blue spectra . with these new responses ,",
    "the first- and second - order light mixing in 4.95.0  are decomposed for the first time .",
    "finally , the flux calibration with the set of the responses is formulated into a matrix form .",
    "this flux calibration demonstrates and succeeds in removing the second - order - light component in both red and blue objects .",
    "the new calibrations enable us to obtain correct 4.95.0  spectra from grism mode observations and are useful in studies of , for example , the carbon monoxide absorption within nearby agns .",
    "note that the calibrations presented here are limited to the observations before the exhaustion of liquid helium ( phases 1 and 2 ) . during the post - helium phase ( phase 3 ) , the temperature of the detector exceeds 40k , and hence",
    ", the operating conditions in phase 3 largely differ from those in phases 1 and 2 .",
    "similar calibrations for phase 3 will be presented in forthcoming papers .",

    "<S> the near - infrared grism covering the wavelength range of 2.55.0  with a spectral resolving power of 120 at 3.6 , is found to be contaminated by second - order light at wavelengths longer than 4.9  which is especially serious for red objects . </S>",

    "<S> second , the spectral responses of the system from the first- and second - order light are simultaneously obtained from two types of standard objects with different colors . the response from the second - order light suggests leakage of the order - sorting filter below 2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between the output of the detector and the intensities of the first- and second - order light are formalized by a matrix equation that combines the two orders . </S>",
    "<S> the removal of the contaminating second - order light can be achieved by solving the matrix equation . </S>",
    "<S> the new calibration extends the available spectral coverage of the grism mode from 4.9  up to 5.0 . </S>",
