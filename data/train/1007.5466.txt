    "in recent years an increasing number of high - resolution spectral and timing observations of isolated neutron stars has become available .",
    "many of these observations concern two peculiar classes of high - energy pulsars , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps : 9 objects plus 1 candidate ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs : 6 objects ) .",
    "historically these two classes of sources were regarded as distinct . while sgrs were first discovered in late 1978-early 1979 , when sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 0526 - 66 exhibited a bright burst of soft @xmath2-rays @xcite ,",
    "axps were observed for the first time in 1981 , when @xcite discovered pulsations in the _ einstein _ source 1e 2259 + 586 .",
    "it was , however , not until the mid 90s that axps were recognized as a class of `` anomalous '' pulsars because of their luminosity substantially exceeding rotational energy losses @xcite .",
    "although sgrs were mainly known as emitters of short , energetic bursts , they are also persistent x - ray sources with properties quite similar to those of axps ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "they all are slow x - ray pulsars , with spin periods in a very narrow range ( @xmath312 s ) , relatively large spin - down rates ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , spin down ages of @xmath61@xmath7 , and stronger magnetic fields compared to those of rotation or accretion powered pulsars ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "axps and sgrs have persistent x - ray luminosities @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "their spectra in the 0.110 kev band are relatively soft and can be empirically fitted with a two - component model , an absorbed blackbody ( @xmath120.6 kev ) plus a power - law ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "_ integral _ observations revealed the presence of sizeable emission up to @xmath14 kev , which accounts for up to @xmath15 of the total flux .",
    "hard x - ray spectra are well represented by a power - law , which dominates above @xmath16 kev in axps .",
    "the large high - energy output can not be explained in terms of rotational energy losses , as in conventional models for radio - pulsars , while the lack of stellar companions argues against accretion .",
    "the powering mechanism of axps and sgrs , instead , is believed to reside in the neutron star ultra - strong magnetic field ( magnetar ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetar scenario appears capable to explain the properties of both the bursts @xcite and the persistent emission ( the twisted magnetosphere model , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; see   [ model ] for details ) , although no definite model for the hard tails was put forward as yet .    the persistent emission of sgrs and axps is now known to be variable",
    "axps , in particular , display different types of x - ray flux variability : from slow , moderate flux changes on timescales of months / years , to intense outbursts with short rise times ( @xmath17 day ) lasting @xmath17 year .",
    "some axps were found to undergo intense and dramatic sgr - like burst activity on sub - second timescales ( xte j1810 - 197 , 4u 0142 + 614 , 1e 1048.1 - 5973 , cxou j164710.2 - 455216 and 1e 2259 + 586 ) .",
    "the discovery of bursts from axps is regarded as further evidence in favor of a common nature of axps and sgrs .",
    "the first case of axp flux variability was observed in 2002 , when 1e 2259 + 586 showed an increase in the persistent flux by a factor @xmath18 with respect to the quiescent level , followed by the emission of @xmath19 short bursts with luminosity @xmath20 @xcite . in early 2003",
    "the 5.54 s axp xte j1810 - 197 was discovered at a luminosity @xmath21 greater than its quiescent value ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of archival data revealed that the outburst started between november 2002 and january 2003 .    on september 21st 2006",
    "an outburst was observed from the axp cxou j164710.2 - 455216 ( @xmath23 s ) .",
    "the flux level was @xmath24 times higher than that measured only 5 days earlier by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "this , much as in the case of xte j1810 - 197 , indicates that some axps are transient sources ( dubbed transient axps ) and may become visible only when they enter an active state .",
    "recently other axps and sgrs showed a series of short bursts of soft @xmath2-rays which was detected by different satellites @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive study of the pulse profile and spectral evolution of the taxps xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 throughout their outbursts of november 2002 and september 2006 , respectively . by confronting timing data with synthetic lightcurves obtained from the twisted magnetosphere model @xcite",
    ", we were able to estimate how the physical parameters of the source ( surface temperature and emitting area , electron energy , twist angle ) evolve in time .",
    "the fits of the pulse profiles also allowed us to infer the geometry of the two systems , i.e. the angles between the magnetic and rotational axes and the line of sight .",
    "spectral models , obtained with the parameter values derived from the timing analysis , provide acceptable fits to _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the transient axp ( taxp ) xte j1810 - 197 was serendipitously discovered in 2003 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) while observing sgr 1806 - 20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source was readily identified as a x - ray pulsar , and soon after a search in archival _ rxte _ data showed that it produced an outburst around 2002 november , followed by a monotonic decline of the x - ray flux .",
    "the x - ray pulsar spin period was found to be 5.54 s , with a spin - down rate @xmath25 . using the standard expression for magneto - rotational losses ,",
    "the inferred value of the ( dipolar ) magnetic field is @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , in order to monitor its evolution in the post - outburst phase .    by using archival very large array ( _ vla _ ) data a transient radio emission with a flux of @xmath27 at @xmath28 was discovered at the _ chandra _ x - ray position of xte j1810 - 197 @xcite . only later on it",
    "was discovered that this radio emission was pulsed , highly polarized and with large flux variability even on very short timescales ( @xcite ) . the x - ray and",
    "the radio pulsations are at the same rotational phase .",
    "since accretion is expected to quench radio emission , this is further evidence against the source being accretion - powered .",
    "deep ir observations were performed for this source , revealing a weak ( @xmath29 mag ) counterpart , with characteristics similar to those of other axps @xcite .",
    "the ir emission is variable @xcite , but no correlations between the ir and x - ray changes were found up to now .",
    "the existence of a correlation at ir / radio wavelengths is uncertain @xcite .",
    "xte j1810 - 197 was observed 9 times by _ xmm - newton _ , between september 2003 and september 2007 , two times every year .",
    "the uninterrupted coverage of the source during 4 years provides an unique opportunity to understand the phenomenology of taxps .",
    "earlier observations of xte j1810 - 197 showed that the source spectrum is well reproduced by a two blackbody model , likely indicating that ( thermal ) emission occurs in two regions of the star surface of different size and temperature : a hot one ( @xmath30 ) and a warm one ( @xmath31 ; @xcite ) . _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations also showed that the pulsed fraction decreases in time .",
    "@xcite discussed the post - outburst spectral evolution of xte j1810 - 197 from 2003 to 2005 in terms of two blackbody components , one arising from a hot spot and the other from a warm concentric ring . by varying the area and temperature of the two regions ,",
    "this ( geometric ) model can reproduce the observed spectra , account for the decline of the pulsed fraction with time and place a strong constrain on the geometry of the source , i.e. the angles between the line of sight and the hot spot axis with respect to the spin axis .",
    "recently , @xcite by re - examining all available _ xmm - newton _ data found that inclusion of a third spectral component , a blackbody at @xmath32 kev , improved the fits .",
    "when this component is added both the area and temperature of the hot component was found to monotonically decrease in time , while the warm component decreased in area but stayed at constant temperature .",
    "the coolest blackbody , which appeared not to change in time , is associated to emission from the ( large ) part of the surface which was not affected by the event which triggered the outburst , and is consistent with the spectral properties of the source as derived from a _ rosat _ detection before the outburst onset .",
    "finally , an interpretation of xte j1810 - 197 spectra in terms of a resonant compton scattering model ( rcs , see  [ model ] ) was presented by @xcite .",
    "the taxp cxou j164710.2 - 455216 was discovered in two _ chandra _ pointings of the young galactic star cluster westerlund 1 in may / june 2005 .",
    "the period of the x - ray pulsar was found to be @xmath33 s @xcite , with a period derivative @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the implied magnetic field is @xmath35 .    in november 2006 ,",
    "an intense burst was detected by the _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ) in westerlund 1 @xcite .",
    "its short duration ( @xmath36 ) suggested that its origin was the candidate axp .",
    "however the event was initially attributed to a nearby galactic source , so the axp was not promptly re - observed by _",
    "swift_. a too observation program with _",
    "swift _ was started 13 hrs after the burst , displaying a persistent flux level @xmath37 times higher than the quiescent one .",
    "cxou j164710.2 - 455216 was observed in radio , with the parkes telescope .",
    "the observation was carried out a week after the outburst onset , with the intent of searching for pulsed emission similar to that of xte j1810 . in this case , however , only a ( tight ) upper limit to the radio flux ( @xmath38 ) was placed @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations carried out across the outburst onset show a complex pulse profile evolution . just before the event the pulsed fraction was @xmath39 , while soon after it became @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pulse profile changed from being single - peaked just before the burst , to showing three peaks soon after it .",
    "cxou j164710.2 - 455216 spectra in the outburst state were fitted either with a two blackbody model ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , or with a blackbody plus power - law model ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that a rcs model also provides a good fit to the data .",
    "it is now widely accepted that axps and sgrs are magnetars , and that their burst / outburst activity , together with the persistent emission , are powered by their huge magnetic field . in particular , the soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath1710 kev ) is believed to originate in a `` twisted '' magnetosphere ( @xmath45 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the currents needed to support the field provide a large enough optical depth to resonant compton scattering of thermal photons emitted by the star surface . since charges are expected to flow along the closed field lines at relativistic velocities , photons gain energy in the ( resonant ) scatterings and ultimately fill a hard tail .",
    "most studies on spectral formation in a twisted magnetosphere @xcite are based on the axially symmetric , force - free solution for a twisted dipolar field presented by @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a sequence of magnetostatic equilibria which , once the polar strength of the magnetic field @xmath46 is fixed , depends only on a single parameter : the radial index of the magnetic field @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) or , equivalently , the twist angle @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spherical components of the field , which depend only on @xmath53 and @xmath54 because of axial symmetry .",
    "knowledge of @xmath55 fixes the current density @xmath56 , and , if the particle velocity is known , also the electron density in the magnetosphere @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the electron charge and @xmath59 is the average charge velocity ( in units of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the charge density of the space charge - limited flow of ions and electrons moving along the closed field lines is orders of magnitude larger than the goldreich - julian density , @xmath61 , associated to the charge flow along the open field lines in radio - pulsars .    in our investigation",
    "we make use of the spectral models presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ntz in the folowing ) , who studied radiative transfer in a globally twisted magnetosphere by means of a 3d monte carlo code .",
    "each model is characterized by the magnetospheric twist @xmath62 , the electron ( constant ) bulk velocity @xmath63 , and the seed photon temperature @xmath64 . the polar field was fixed at @xmath65 . in the applications presented by ntz , it was assumed that the star surface emits unpolarized , blackbody radiation and is at uniform temperature .",
    "concerning the present investigation , the most critical assumption is that of a globally twisted magnetosphere , as discussed in some more detail in   [ discus ] .",
    "taking a constant value for the electrons bulk velocity is certainly an oversimplification and reflects the lack of a detailed model for the magnetospheric currents . in a realistic case",
    "one would expect that @xmath63 is a function of position .",
    "however , resonant scattering is possible only where the bulk velocity is mildly relativistic .",
    "if along a flux tube there are large variations of the lorentz factor , only the region where @xmath66 will contribute to scattering . moreover , preliminary calculations of the dynamics of charged particles in a twisted force - free magnetosphere performed accounting for both electrostatic acceleration and compton drag indicate that @xmath63 is indeed fairly constant along the central part of a flux tube ( beloborodov , private communication ) .",
    "the assumption of unpolarized thermal radiation is not cogent either , since we are not interested in the polarization of the escaping radiation and the emergent spectrum is quite insensitive to the polarization fraction of the seed photons ( see , e.g. , fig . 4 of ntz ) .",
    "the code works by dividing the stellar surface into @xmath67 zones of equal area by means of a ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) grid , where @xmath70 is the magnetic colatitude and @xmath69 the longitude .",
    "after a few scatterings photons escape from the neutron star magnetosphere and are collected on a spherical surface ( the `` sky '' ) which is divided into @xmath71 patches , similarly to what is done for the star surface .",
    "the key point is that the evolution of seed photons from each patch is followed separately .",
    "this allows us to treat an arbitrary surface temperature distribution without the need to perform new monte carlo runs , by simply combining together models from runs with different temperatures at the post - production level ( the geometry is shown in fig . [ mag1 ] )     and @xmath72 are the star spin and magnetic axis , respectively .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the line - of - sight .",
    "the two angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 are also shown .",
    "the star surface is divided into three regions : a hot polar cap ( red ) , a warm corona ( blue ) and a colder zone ( gray ) .",
    "[ mag1],width=316 ]    monte carlo models are computed ( and stored ) for the simplest geometrical case , in which the spin and the magnetic axes are aligned .",
    "as discussed in ntz , the most general situation in which the spin and magnetic axes are at an arbitrary angle @xmath74 can be treated at the post - production level .",
    "if @xmath73 is the inclination of the line - of - sight ( los ) with respect to the star spin axis and @xmath75 is the rotational phase angle , the co - ordinates of the points where the los intersects the sky can be found in terms of @xmath74 , @xmath73 and @xmath75 .",
    "the pulse profile in any given energy band is then obtained by integrating over the selected range the energy - dependent counts at these positions as the star rotates ( see again ntz for details ) . in order to compare model lightcurves with observations , integration over energy",
    "is performed by accounting for both interstellar absorption and the detector response function . actually , the interstellar absorption cross - section @xmath76 and the response function @xmath77 depend on the photon energy at infinity @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the energy in the star frame ( which is used in the monte carlo calculation ) and @xmath80 is the schwarzschild radius ( we assume a schwarzschild space - time and take @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "our model pulse profile in the @xmath83 $ ] energy band is then proportional to @xmath84}a(\\bar e ) n(\\alpha , e)\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the hydrogen column density and @xmath86 is the phase- and energy - dependent count rate . in the applications below we used the @xcite model for interstellar absorption and ,",
    "since we deal with _ xmm - newton _ observations , we adopted the epic - pn response function .",
    "we remark that the monte carlo spectral calculation is carried out assuming a flat space - time ( i.e. photons propagate along straight lines ) , so that , apart from the gravitational redshift , no allowance is made for general - relativistic effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "in particular , no constraints on the star mass and radius can be derived in the present case from the comparison of model and observed pulse profiles ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , phase - averaged spectra are computed by summing over all phases the energy - dependent counts .",
    "note that @xmath87 , while @xmath73 is in the range @xmath88 $ ] because of the asymmetry between the north and south magnetic poles introduced by the current flow .",
    "our first step in the study of the two taxps xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 was to reproduce the pulse profiles ( and their time evolution ) within the rcs model discussed in ",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the fit to the observed pulse profiles in different energy bands ( total : @xmath89 , soft : @xmath90 , hard : @xmath91 ) provides an estimate of the source parameters , including the two geometrical angles @xmath74 and @xmath73 . while the twist angle , electron velocity and surface temperature may vary in the different observations ( although they must be the same in the different energy bands for a given observation ) , the fits have to produce values of @xmath74 and @xmath73 which are at all epochs compatible with one another ( to within the errors ) in order to be satisfactory .",
    "we then computed the phase - averaged spectra for the two sources at the various epochs for the same sets of parameters and compared them with the observed ones .",
    "there are several reasons which led us to choose such an approach .",
    "the main one is that , as discussed in ntz ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectral fitting alone is unable to constrain the two geometrical angles .",
    "moreover , lightcurve fitting allows for a better control in the case in which the surface thermal map is complex and changes in time ( see below ) .    for the present investigation ,",
    "a model archive was generated beforehand .",
    "each model was computed by evolving @xmath92 photons for @xmath93 surface patches ( @xmath94 photons ) .",
    "the parameter grids are : @xmath95 ( step @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 ( step @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 ( step @xmath100 ) .",
    "photons are collected on a @xmath101 angular grid on the sky , and in @xmath102 energy bins , equally spaced in @xmath103 in the range @xmath104 .",
    "the analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "we first used the principal component analysis ( pca ) to explore the properties of the lightcurves as a population and to select the model within the archive that is closest to the observed one at a given epoch .",
    "this serves as the starting point for the pulse profile fitting procedure , which we performed by assuming that the whole star surface is at the same temperature .",
    "the fitting is then repeated first for the case in which the surface thermal distribution consists of a hot spot and a cooler region , and then by generating a new archive with a finer surface gridding , and applying it in the case of a surface thermal map consisting of a hot spot , a warm corona and a cooler region ( see again fig [ mag1 ] ) .",
    "finally , the source parameters derived from the lightcurve fitting are used to confront the model and observed ( phase - averaged ) spectra .",
    "phase - resolved spectral analysis , although feasible in our model and potentially important , was not attempted because the decay in flux of both sources makes the counting statistics rather poor after the first one / two observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details in the case of xte j1810 - 197 ) .",
    "the principal component analysis is a method of multivariate statistics that allows to reduce the number of variables @xmath105 needed to describe a data set by introducing a new set variables , the principal components ( pcs ) @xmath106 .",
    "the pcs are linear combinations of the original variables and are such that @xmath107 displays the largest variance , @xmath108 the second largest , and so on . by using the pcs it is possible to describe the data set in terms of a limited number of variables , which however , carry most of the information contained in the original sample ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "once the pca was applied to the lightcurve set , we found that the first three pcs ( @xmath115 ) accounts for as much as @xmath116 of the sample variance .",
    "this means that the entire set is satisfactorily described in terms of just three variables instead of the original 32 ( see * ? ? ? * for an interpretation of @xmath117 ) . a graphic representation of the lightcurves in the archive in terms of the first three pcs",

    "this is most probably due to the different shapes of the pulses in the two sources . because of the very peculiar lightcurve of cxou j164710.2 - 455216 , which can be reproduced by our model only invoking a nearly orthogonal rotator , even small depatures of @xmath74 and @xmath73 from their best - fit values results in a rapid growth of the @xmath128",
    "this does not occur for the rather sinusoidal pulse of xte j1810 - 197 since the model can produce lightcurves of more or less the right shape in a wider range of angles .     for cxou j164710.2 - 455216 ; computed pulse profiles refer to the 3 t model and initial phases are arbitrary .",
    "[ 1647_lc],width=316 ]    besides being of limited use because of the complex shape of the pulse , the pulsed fraction analysis was hindered by the lower count rate , especially at low energies and was not pursued further for this source . as in xte j1810 - 197 , we checked that the values obtained from the minimization routine indeed correspond to minima of the reduced @xmath128s .",

    "the simultaneous study of the timing and spectral characteristics of the transient axps xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 presented in this paper shows that the post - burst evolution of two sources share a number of similar properties .",
    "in particular , the long - term variability of the pulse profiles and spectra appears to be ( semi)quantitatively consistent with a scenario in which the star surface thermal distribution and magnetospheric properties progressively change in time .",
    "our results were derived within the twisted magnetosphere model for magnetars and support a picture in which the twist affects only a small bundle of closed field lines around one of the magnetic poles . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "if the twist is initially confined along the magnetic axis , the returning currents hit a limited portion of the star surface ( typically a polar cap ) , which becomes hotter . in this scenario",
    "the post - outburst evolution is related to the twist decay , during which the bundle shrinks , and the heated region decreases both in size and temperature .",
    "we found evidence for a cooling / shrinking of the heated polar cap in both sources , together with a decrease of the twist angle .",
    "it should be noted that our magnetospheric model assumes a global twist , since no spectral calculations are currently available for a localized twist .    within this common framework , there are nonetheless differences between the two taxps . for xte j1810 - 197",
    "we found that the star thermal map comprises three regions : a hot cap , a surrounding warm corona , and the rest of the surface at a colder temperature .",
    "the hot cap decreases in size and temperature until it becomes indistinguishable from the corona around march 2006 .",
    "also the warm corona shrinks , although its temperature stays about constant at @xmath345 .",
    "it becomes a cap in march 2006 and it is still visible in our last observation ( september 2007 ) although its size is down to @xmath346 of the entire surface .",
    "the rest of the surface remains at a temperature comparable to the quiescent one ( as measured by _",
    "rosat _ ) during the entire evolution , indicating that the outburst likely involved only a fraction of the star surface .",
    "@xcite obtained similar results using a 3bb model , although they did not attempt to locate the different emitting regions on the star surface nor to fit the pulse profiles . in their ( purely spectral ) analysis",
    "the hot region is visible slightly longer ( until march 2006 ) ; the reason for the difference with respect to our results being most probably the resolution of our surface grid .",
    "moreover , in our case the hot temperature decrease is more pronounced .",
    "the twist angle decreases from @xmath347 rad to @xmath348 rad during the first two years , and then it remains roughly constant .",
    "much as in the case of xte j1810 - 197 , the thermal map of cxou j164710.2 - 455216 is well reproduced by three different regions . however , while the evolution of the hot cap is similar , i.e. it decreases in size and temperature until it disappears in the august 2008 observation , the behavior of the warm corona is different .",
    "now the warm temperature remains constant at @xmath333 and the area increases .",
    "actually , the area of the `` hot+warm '' region is constant and covers about @xmath335 of the surface , while the remaining @xmath337 is at a constant cooler temperature , @xmath122 .",
    "this is suggestive of a picture in which the \" quiescent  state of the source is characterized by a two - temperature map , with a warm polar region superposed to the cooler surface .",
    "the outburst might have heated a portion of the warm cap , producing the hot zone which then cooled off .",
    "it is intriguing to notice that the disappearance of the hot spot occurs at the same time ( august 2008 ) at which the pulse profile dramatically changed , switching from a three - peaked to a single - peaked pattern .",
    "a quasi - sinusoidal shape of the lightcurve was observed when the source was in quiescence @xcite .",
    "however , at that time the pulsed fraction was nearly 100% above 4 kev , likely indicating the presence of a small hot spot which is periodically occulted as the star rotates .",
    "this is in agreement with our finding that this taxp is a nearly orthogonal rotator . whether cxou j164710.2 - 455216 is presently approaching quiescence is unclear .",
    "if this is the case , its quiescent state is different from that observed in 2005 and also from that of xte j1810 - 197 .",
    "it is worth stressing that our claim that the temperature does not change spatially in each of the regions should not be taken literally .",
    "the assumption that the surface can be divided in three ( or two ) thermal regions was mainly introduced to simplify the calculations while catching the essential features of the model .",
    "a smooth temperature variation within a zone is likely to be present .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile the observed pulsed fraction of xte j1810 - 197 in the september 2006 observation ( @xmath349 , see fig .",
    "[ pf_1810 ] ) even accounting for the temperature gradient induced by the large - scale dipolar field .",
    "this may be an indication that , as our analysis shows , there is a residual twist even in the quiescent state .",
    "in this respect we note that our spectral calculation is based on a rather fine subdivision of the star surface ( @xmath350 patches in the final version of the archive ) , so we could have produced pulse profiles for arbitrary complicated thermal maps .",
    "the motivation of our choice of the thermal distribution ( a hot polar cap and a warm a corona superimposed to the colder surface ) is threefold : i ) a model based on two thermal components , originating from a hot cap and a warm corona , was successfully applied to xte j1810 - 197 by @xcite ; ii ) inclusion of a third , colder component in the spectrum of the same source was shown to be statistically significant by @xcite ; and iii ) it is consistent with theoretical predictions for a twisted magnetosphere in an axp ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see above ) .",
    "in addition , this is the simplest map for which we were able to obtain constant values , to within the errors , for the two geometrical angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 during the entire period covered by the observations .    in their analysis of xte j1810 - 197 , @xcite assumed that the x - rays come from two concentric regions with varying temperatures and areas , each emitting a blackbody spectrum ; the rest of the surface was taken to be at zero temperature .",
    "they derived the angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and , although their solution is not unique , they claim that the pair @xmath351 , @xmath352 is favored . while this value of @xmath74 coincides with our estimate ,",
    "the two values of the inclination of the line - of - sight are in substantial disagreement . also the emitting areas of the hot / warm region and their temperatures turn out to be different in the two cases .",
    "their estimate of the hot temperature is always higher than ours and the size of the warm corona is not monotonically decreasing .",
    "we remark that quantitative differences are to be expected given the different assumed spectral models ( blackbody vs. rcs ) ; moreover because @xcite did not include a colder region .",
    "finally , we caveat that our analysis relies on a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "we already mentioned that the synthetic spectra we used were obtained with the monte carlo code by @xcite , which was designed to solve radiation transport in a globally twisted magnetosphere .",
    "even though we took thermal photons to originate mostly in a limited polar region , this does not self - consistently describe resonant up - scattering in a magnetosphere where only a limited bundle of field lines is actually twisted , as is probably the case in axps @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we discussed in  [ 1810spec ] , the ntzang xspec model is available only in tabular form and it was created assuming emission at constant temperature from the entire star surface .",
    "as such , it is not suited to be applied directly to the present case . as a compromise , we decided to fit the spectra by adding together two / three ( absorbed ) ntzang components , each associated to one of the emitting regions , at temperatures @xmath124 , @xmath197 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "while this procedure works ( and is routinely employed ) in the case of blackbody spectra , it is expected to be only approximately correct when different ntzang components are added together .",
    "the reason is that the effects of resonant scattering on thermal photons depends on the location of the primary emission , since the magnetospheric electron density is not isotropic . as a consequence , assuming thermal emission from a cap of limited size or from the entire star , even if the two are taken at the same temperature , will give rise to different spectra .",
    "we checked this approximation for all the spectra we analyzed , finding that the maximum relative error is @xmath353 , while the energy - averaged error is always between 0.2 and 0.4 both for xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 .",
    "an example is shown in fig [ conf_spectra ] .",
    "although we are aware that this is not optimal , it provides a reasonable way to describe radiation coming from a magnetar with non - uniform thermal emission within the context of our model .",
    ", width=316 ]",
    "the monitoring of the two taxps xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 , carried out with _ xmm - newton _ in recent years , gave us the possibility to test the twisted magnetosphere model and understand how the physical parameters in the two sources change during the post - outburst evolution .",
    "we summarize our main findings below , remarking again that they were obtained under a number of assumptions ( e.g. globally twisted field , three temperature thermal map ) .    * soon after the outburst onset the surface thermal distribution in xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 is well described by three components : a hot cap , a surrounding warm corona while the rest of the neutron star surface is at a lower temperature .",
    "* the analysis of the pulse profile evolution for xte j1810 - 197 revealed that both the hot cap and the warm corona decrease in size so that in the last observation ( september 2007 ) virtually all the neutron star surface emits at a temperature compatible with the quiescent one . *",
    "the same analysis for cxou j164710.2 - 455216 showed that the hot cap decreases in temperature and size , while the warm corona remains constant in temperature while it increases in size . in the last two observations we examined ( august 2008 and august 2009 ) the source thermal map comprises a hot cap covering @xmath354 of the neutron star surface , while the remaining surface is cooler .",
    "there are hints that this could be the quiescent state of the taxp .",
    "* for both sources the twist angle is highest at the outburst onset and then monotonically decreases in time until it reaches a nearly constant , non - zero value .",
    "* the same model configuration which best - fits the observed pulse profiles ( thermal map , twist angle , electron bulk velocity , and geometrical angles ) provides a reasonable description of _ xmm - newton _ spectra in the 0.110 kev band for both sources .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that a self - consistent spectral and timing analysis , based on a realistic modelling of resonant scattering , was carried out for magnetar sources , considering simultaneously a large number of datasets over a baseline of years .",
    "present results support to a picture in which only a limited portion of the magnetosphere was affected by the twist .",
    "future developments will require detailed spectral calculations in a magnetosphere with a localized twist which decays in time .",
