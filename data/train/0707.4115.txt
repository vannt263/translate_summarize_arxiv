    "the experimental realization of trapped quasi - one - dimensional atomic gases in optical lattices during the last few years @xcite has provided a new impetus for the study of the effects of strong correlations on the physical properties of fundamental quantum - mechanical systems of interacting particles .",
    "one very interesting aspect of this still emerging field , in contrast to traditional condensed matter physics , is that more - or - less ideal realizations of famous toy models like the interacting bose gas in one dimension ( the lieb - liniger model @xcite ) can be constructed and investigated .",
    "it is moreover usually possible to tune the parameters to arbitrary values , in contrast to the fixed values in a solid - state crystal , and to obtain systems in which disorder and impurities are essentially absent .",
    "experimental measurements can typically be related to relatively simple theoretical objects like expectation values and correlation functions of local fields .",
    "ideally , one would like to obtain direct quantitative comparisons between these , providing an extremely nontrivial check on our understanding of the physics involved .",
    "from the theory side , calculating the response functions of a strongly correlated system is more often than not a difficult , if not insurmountable task .",
    "in one dimensional quantum mechanics , the situation is not as hopeless as in higher dimensions in view of the existence of many nonperturbative methods @xcite .",
    "while features such as asymptotic correlation functions can be obtained from bosonization @xcite , it remains however extremely rare to be able to provide general analytical results valid for all ranges of momentum and frequency .",
    "our objective in this paper is to provide an extensive treatment of a situation where much analytical progress is possible , namely that of the lieb - liniger model for a one - dimensional bose gas in the attractive regime . like the repulsive case ,",
    "the attractive one - dimensional gas is solvable with a bethe ansatz , so we can hope for full nonperturbative solutions . on the other hand , although the bethe ansatz offers a good basis for providing an exact solution to some models of interest in one - dimensional quantum physics , it is not necessarily an easy framework to use to compute dynamical correlation functions or other objects going beyond simple equilibrium thermodynamics . in the case of the lieb - liniger model , while it is now possible to obtain accurate numerical results for the dynamical structure factor @xcite and for the one - body function @xcite for the _ repulsive _ lieb - liniger model by mixing the algebraic bethe ansatz with intensive numerical work , obtaining a full analytical solution for these objects in the thermodynamic limit remains a severe challenge @xcite .",
    "here , we demonstrate that the _ attractive _ gas is in fact fully tractable analytically .",
    "a summary of our results has appeared recently in @xcite .",
    "the physics of the attractive lieb - liniger model , less conventional than in the repulsive regime , has received attention in the past .",
    "most importantly , the ground state energy and wavefunction were investigated in @xcite , and a more general treatment including excitations was offered in @xcite .",
    "the purely one - dimensional case also serves as a basis for the investigation of effects beyond the gross - pitaevskii mean - field in higher dimension @xcite .",
    "overall , the scattering and diffusion of solitons has also been studied @xcite , and mean - field approaches based on the gross - pitaevskii equation have been developed @xcite .",
    "the case of attractive interactions is in principle accessible experimentally in the context of bright solitons in quasi 1d traps @xcite since the effective one - dimensional coupling constant @xcite can effectively be tuned via feshbach resonance or transverse confinement to essentially any positive or negative value .",
    "such sort of solitonic physics can also be realized using photons in optical fibres @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by a reminder of the model , its solution in terms of a bethe ansatz , and of the important correlation functions to consider in section [ sec : setup ] . after describing eigenstates in more detail in section [ sec : eigenstates ] ,",
    "we give the important form factors in section [ sec : ff ] , which are then used in section [ sec : dsf ] and [ sec:1pgf ] to obtain the dynamical structure factor and one - body function at zero temperature .",
    "most of the more tedious calculations have been relegated to [ app : reduced_be]-[app : summation ] .",
    "we end by offering some conclusions and perspectives in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "these wavefunctions are symmetric in the position coordinates .",
    "the rapidities of a given eigenstate obey a pauli - like exclusion principle , namely the bethe wavefunction vanishes if two rapidities coincide .",

    ", @xmath27 denotes the norm of state @xmath20 .",
    "let us begin by discussing the eigenstates , and by first recalling some standard features of the bethe ansatz ( [ ba_wavefn ] ) for the model at hand , and how they adapt to the attractive case .",
    "as can be seen from the schrdinger equation , given a set of rapidities , the energy and momentum of the corresponding state are @xmath28 quantization of the theory is achieved by imposing the periodicity conditions @xmath29 which lead to the bethe equations @xmath30 or in logarithmic form @xmath31 the quantum numbers @xmath32 are half - odd integers if @xmath33 is even , and integers if @xmath33 is odd .    in the repulsive case ,",
    "given a proper set of quantum numbers @xmath34 , the solution of the bethe equations for the set of rapidities @xmath16 exists and is unique @xcite due to the convexity of the yang - yang action associated with ( [ be_rep ] ) .",
    "furthermore all these solutions have real rapidities @xmath35 . for the attractive case ,",
    "the situation is completely different .",
    "we will define @xmath36 as the interaction parameter ; let us rewrite our bethe equations as @xmath37 consider now a complex rapidity @xmath38 .",
    "the bethe equation for this rapidity is @xmath39 we consider finite @xmath33 and @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 on the left - hand side .",
    "looking at the finite product on the right - hand side , we conclude that there must thus be a rapidity @xmath43 such that @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 on the left - hand side , and there must thus be a rapidity @xmath43 such that @xmath47 .",
    "in general , the atoms will thus form bound states in the form of strings in the complex plane . for a given number of atoms @xmath33",
    ", we can construct eigenstates with fixed string content by partitioning @xmath33 into @xmath48 strings of length @xmath49 , denoting the total number of strings as @xmath50 .",
    "we clearly have @xmath51 specifically , we will parametrize the string rapidities as @xmath52 with exponentially small deviations @xmath53 as usually done in these cases ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in our string notation ,",
    "the index @xmath54 labels rapidities within the string , and @xmath55 labels strings of a given length . a pictorial representation of two string states is given in fig .",
    "[ stringfig ] .",
    "we stress that perfect strings ( i.e. with all the @xmath56 ) are exact eigenstates in the limit @xmath57 for arbitrary @xmath33 .",
    "it is then natural to consider the limit @xmath57 at fixed @xmath33 .",
    "this is different from what done in the repulsive case where the limit @xmath58 at fixed density @xmath59 is performed . here",
    ", the @xmath33 particles remain strongly correlated and bound to one another even when @xmath60 , as we will explicitely see later on ( see in particular the section about the norm of a string state [ normsec ] ) .",
    "the string deviations @xmath61 are effectively studied in @xcite , but depend sensitively on the particular boundary conditions used .",
    "we will however not need the explicit values of these deviations : we will only need the fact that they are small , and treat the resulting limit carefully in the norm and form factor expressions . for the moment",
    ", however , they can be dropped .",
    "these bound states should be viewed as individual particles of mass @xmath49 , with momentum and energy of the string centered on @xmath62 given by @xmath63 such strings are known but not commonly discussed in the literature on the bose gas @xcite , as they do not appear in the repulsive case . however , their equivalents exist in integrable spin chains , where they have been extensively studied .",
    "the technology to treat them , at least on the level of eigenstates , is thus standard .",
    "the fact that all deviations are exponentially small means that we can obtain a much simpler set of equations involving only the string centers @xmath62 .",
    "the derivation of these equations in presented in [ app : reduced_be ] , the final result being @xmath64 with @xmath65 half - odd integer ( integer ) if @xmath48 is even ( odd ) , and where the scattering phase shifts are @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "these strings are stable particles under scattering with one another , and are therefore soliton - like objects .",
    "one point worth emphasizing is that the scattering phase shifts ( [ reduced_phi ] ) are simply those of breathers in the classical limit @xmath68 of the sine - gordon model after a trivial reparametrization of the rapidity .",
    "the sine - gordon soliton s mass is in this limit much higher than that of the breathers , which have an evenly - spaced rest mass .",
    "the string of order @xmath49 in the attractive lieb - liniger model is consequently not so much a soliton , but more accurately a nonrelativistic sine - gordon breather of order @xmath49 .",
    "the lowest energy state will be obtained by forming a bound state of all @xmath33 particles centered on zero @xcite ( see fig . [ stringfig ] ) , namely by choosing @xmath69 the corresponding energy is @xmath70 note that this goes like @xmath71 , unlike the repulsive case where the energy is not extensive .",
    "although our results are not limited to this case , we will often consider the limit of a large number of particles @xmath72 , with weak interactions @xmath73 such that the parameter @xmath74 remains finite . in this case , the ground state energy per particle also remains finite , @xmath75 .",
    "we will find some similarly simplified limiting values for the correlations functions .",
    "it is however important to note that this is not a conventional thermodynamic limit with finite energy density as in the repulsive case .",
    "excitations above the ground state are then obtained by either simply giving momentum to the ground state @xmath33 string , or more elaborately by partitioning it into smaller strings to which individual momenta can be given .",
    "we consider here only the @xmath33 atom sector relevant for the dynamical structure factor .",
    "the case of states with @xmath76 ( or less ) atoms trivially follows .",
    "we will label the string content of eigenstates by column - separated entries specifying the length and number of each different string type .",
    "for example @xmath77 will be a state with a @xmath78 string and a @xmath79 string , and @xmath80 a state with an @xmath81 string , an @xmath82 string and two @xmath83 strings ; the red state in figure [ stringfig ] is a @xmath84 state .",
    "single - particle excited states will be obtained by giving finite momentum to the ground state @xmath33-string , @xmath85 such states have energy above the ground state given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the total state momentum . for these states , there is only one bethe equation for the string center @xmath20 , namely @xmath88 with @xmath89 an integer , so that the momentum is quantized as for a free wave , @xmath90 .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath33 , this energy band becomes flat and quasi - degenerate with the ground state .",
    "these are obtained by splitting up the ground - state @xmath33 string in two pieces . in general , consider having an @xmath78 and an @xmath79 string : @xmath91 the energy of this state above the ground state is given by @xmath92 where we have defined the rest energy @xmath93 the total momentum is the sum of the two string momenta , @xmath94 so we can write the energy as @xmath95 similarly to the single - particle case , the bethe equations are here very simple , namely @xmath96 with @xmath97 integers . in the limit of large l , we can thus ignore the scattering phase shift , and take @xmath98 and @xmath99 as free parameters .",

    "we need to complete our characterization of individual eigenstates by providing a formula for their norm . given a set of rapidities solution to the bethe equations ,",
    "the norm of the corresponding bethe eigenstate is given by the gaudin - korepin formula @xcite , in this case @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the gaudin matrix whose entries are given by @xmath109 - k ( \\lambda_j , \\lambda_k ) \\label{gaudin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kernel is @xmath110    to cover the case of string states in the attractive regime , these formulas must be adapted in view of its string deviation @xmath111 indeterminacy .",
    "we do this in detail in [ app : norm ] , where we obtain the final result @xmath112 where @xmath113    the norm of a single @xmath33 string is thus simply @xmath114 and that of an @xmath77 state with rapidities @xmath115 respectively for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 strings , @xmath116    as we already mentioned , unlike what happens in the repulsive case , where the low - density limit @xmath33 finite , @xmath40 is trivial , the physics of the attractive case remains nontrivial .",
    "this is not a low - density limit , as the atoms tend to clump together in wavepackets of finite extent .",
    "the ground state wavefunction is thus really a localized wavepacket spread out uniformly over the whole system , as can be seen from our choice of normalization : this depends on @xmath6 generally as @xmath117 , thus counting the number of strings present , reflecting the fact that the strings are essentially independent , almost free particles . in the presence of a weak harmonic confining trap in an experiment , the ground state",
    "would thus be obtained by a convolution of the @xmath33 string wavepacket wavefunction with a ground state harmonic oscillator part .",
    "our results could straightforwardly be adapted to cover this case .",
    "since the bethe wavefunctions are rather involved , comprising a factorially large number of separate free wave terms , it is a priori extremely difficult to calculate matrix elements of local operators in this basis .",
    "however , the calculation can be performed for a number of integrable models ( including the bose gas ) using the technology of the algebraic bethe ansatz , which is sufficiently powerful to provide a handle on this combinatorial - like problem .",
    "in fact , the aba provides these matrix elements for the density and field operators in terms of determinants of matrices whose entries are simple analytical functions of the rapidities of both eigenstates involved @xcite .",
    "these formulas are also applicable , at least in principle , to the attractive bose gas , provided some care is taken with string deviations .",
    "the purpose of this section is to perform this calculation .    for the repulsive gas ,",
    "the form factors have to be evaluated numerically , since the solutions to the bethe equations can not be found analytically .",
    "for the attractive case , however , we can actually calculate these determinants analytically to leading order in the exponentially small string deviations , since we know the ground state to this precision without having to solve any bethe equation .",
    "the form factors of the field and density operators between the ground state and an arbitrary excited state are computed in [ app : density_ff ] and [ app : field_ff ] , and are given by @xmath118 where we have defined the function @xmath119 for later convenience , the asymptotic properties of @xmath120 as @xmath121 are given by @xmath122^{-m } ( 1 + { \\cal o } ( m / n ) ) , \\nonumber \\\\ h_{n - m } ( x ) \\rightarrow \\frac{f_m ( x)}{f_{2n } ( x ) } \\left [ n^2 + x^2 \\right]^{m/2 } ( 1 + { \\cal o } ( m / n)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the function @xmath123 for @xmath124 , we have further that @xmath125 .",

    "the response of the system to an external probe therefore essentially occurs with zero recoil energy , which is interpreted as a mssbauer - like effect : the attractive gas is really like a crystal along the imaginary axis in momentum space , and responds like a single particle since the gap to the lowest excitations is finite . for large atom number @xmath33 ,",
    "higher families of excited states have their contribution to the correlation functions suppressed by progressively higher powers of @xmath164 , and can be ignored for all practical purposes .",

    "using our results , it is possible to compute other more elaborate form factors , for example those of the density or field operator between higher excited states involving nontrivial string partitioning .",
    "these take the form of reduced determinants involving only the string centers , but are still obtainable using a reasoning similar to the one used in the calculation of the single - string form factors in [ app : density_ff ] and [ app : field_ff ] .",

    "it would be interesting to see whether the methods used here could be adapted to such cases , and used to derive related expressions for correlation functions like the spin structure factor .",
    "such an object would also be in principle observable experimentally @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is to consider the effects of a finite temperature .",
    "this would probably be of great importance for experiments , since the ground state is part of a dispersionless band in the large @xmath33 limit ; any temperature greater than @xmath166 would thus quickly smear out the correlations in the momentum direction .",
    "however , all the necessary form factors for the calculation of the finite - temperature response functions are readily obtained directly from the results we presented , and it is more or less straightforward to obtain the finite temperature dynamical correlations .",
    "the presence of a harmonic trap can also be taken into account by convolving the ground state wavepacket with a harmonic oscillator wavefunction .",

    "in this appendix , we consider the fate of the gaudin - korepin norm formula in the case of general string states .",
    "a similar treatment can be found in @xcite .",
    "first of all , the prefactor of equation ( [ usual_norm ] ) explicitly reads ( in string notation ) @xmath177 where we have separated the product into inter- and intra - string parts and defined @xmath178 .    to leading order in string deviations , this prefactor",

    "factors @xmath184 for @xmath190 can be similarly eliminated from two off - diagonal and one diagonal positions .",
    "the string block then has @xmath191 exponentially large factors @xmath184 on the diagonal , and all off - diagonal terms within the block can be neglected . doing similar operations for all strings in the eigenstate and keeping all remaining factors into account",
