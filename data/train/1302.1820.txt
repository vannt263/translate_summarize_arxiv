    "the most - complete theoretical model is based on coupled modes of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the complex electric field can be decomposed into a sum of spatial functions for the modes , @xmath0 , multiplied by the evolving envelopes , @xmath1 :    @xmath2    to simplify the problem , we consider only the radially - symmetric modes ( written explicitly in the supplementary information ) , which are relevant to our experiments .",
    "the normalized modes , @xmath3 , and corresponding propagation constants , @xmath4 , can be written as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a laguerre polynomial , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the index difference between the center and the cladding of the fiber , @xmath9 is the fiber core radius , and @xmath10 is the fundamental mode size . by neglecting higher - order dispersive and nonlinear effects , the equations can then be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the difference between the @xmath14 and the fundamental mode of the first ( second ) coefficient in the taylor expansion of @xmath15 about @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 corresponds to the material group - velocity dispersion , @xmath18 is the nonlinear coefficient , and @xmath19 are the nonlinear coupling coefficients ( defined explicitly in the supplementary information ) .",
    "the equations are solved numerically for a variety of input fields launched into 100 m of a standard grin fiber ( parameters in methods ) , to correspond to experiments described below .",
    "the number of modes , and hence equations , required to account for the pulse propagation depends on the modes that are initially seeded . for the cases studied here the grin fiber",
    "is seeded by the output of a standard single - mode fiber and @xmath20 of the energy is accounted for with only the 3 lowest order symmetric modes ( figure [ vectorfig](a ) ) .        in linear propagation , the modes separate in time owing to their different group velocities and the pulse duration in each mode increases because of material dispersion ( middle panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "the beam waist oscillates with period @xmath21 until the pulses separate temporally , after which the oscillation ceases and the spatial evolution is essentially that of the fundamental mode . at higher powers ,",
    "nonlinearity balances the material dispersion , mode - coupling counteracts the group - velocity mismatch , and a multi - component soliton forms . in other words , the duration and temporal location of light energy in each mode",
    "are locked , and remain unchanged with propagation . while the existence of solitons in multimode systems was suggested based on analytical arguments @xcite , this is the first demonstration that multi - component solitons are even theoretically stable in a complete numerical model of the coupled modes .",
    "the result of launching a 300-fs , @xmath220.5-nj pulse is shown in figure [ vectorfig](b ) , e.g. the three modes overlap in time , with the group delay equal to an energy - weighted average of the modal delays .",
    "the spectra of the individual modes shift to have the same group velocity , with the higher - order modes blue - shifted ( figure [ vectorfig](c ) ) .",
    "the structured spectra result from radiation of energy from each mode as the soliton forms .",
    "similar structure appears when solitons form in single - mode fiber ( supplementary figure 2 in the supplementary information . )",
    "the space - time profile is nearly symmetric ( figure [ bigfig](a ) ) , with a sech@xmath23 temporal intensity profile ( figure [ bigfig](b ) ) and a gaussian spatial profile ( figure [ bigfig](c ) ) .",
    "the mode - field diameter ( mfd ) averaged over the pulse ( figure [ bigfig](d ) ) oscillates around the fundamental mode size ( @xmath24 ) with a period equal to that of low - intensity light .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) pulse duration averaged over the beam ( figure [ bigfig](e ) ) quickly converges to a steady solution that is @xmath25 times shorter than the output pulse duration would be due to group - velocity dispersion alone .",
    "alternatively , the system can be analyzed with a nonlinear wave equation for the total field .",
    "standard procedures are used to reduce the maxwell equations to a single wave equation . by employing the paraxial and slowly - varying envelope approximations ,",
    "a gross - pitaevskii equation is obtained @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the slowly - varying envelope at center frequency @xmath16 and t is time in a reference frame moving at the group velocity of the pulse .",
    "the paraxial approximation does neglect the variation of group velocities among the modes .",
    "the approximation is justified in light of the solution to the coupled - field equations , which shows the modes aligning to a common group velocity . to reach manageable computational times ,",
    "we reduce the system to the 2-dimensional case with y=0 as in ref .",
    "the solution quickly converges and simulations are stopped after 52 m of propagation ( which requires 20 days of computation ) .",
    "remarkably , the soliton solution is nearly identical to that found with the coupled - mode equations ( figure [ bigfig ] ) , except for a slight decrease in the amplitude of the spatial oscillation ( figure [ bigfig](i ) ) .",
    "the identification of terms in equation [ 3deq ] with specific physical processes provides insight , but exact analytic solutions are not known .",
    "an approximate analytic solution is obtained by making the variational approximation with the trial function @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy , @xmath30 is the pulse duration , @xmath31 is the beam width , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are chirp parameters , and @xmath34 is an arbitrary phase @xcite .",
    "if the quantity @xmath35 is much less than one , a stable fixed point to the equations of motion is given by @xmath36 for typical fiber parameters @xmath37 , so the approximation is excellent .",
    "the fixed point is thus the fundamental mode of the grin fiber with a temporal profile that corresponds to the soliton with that beam size .",
    "the theoretical results suggest that the required pulse energy at 1550 nm can be reached with readily - designed er - doped fiber lasers .",
    "experiments were performed with a source that generates @xmath38-fs pulses ( red lines in figure [ 500pjex](a ) and ( b ) ) with energy up to @xmath39 nj . the initial spatial profile is the fundamental mode of an ordinary single - mode fiber with mfd of 11.5 @xmath40 m ( figure [ 500pjex](c ) ) . with these parameters , 100 m of grin fiber",
    "comprises @xmath41 dispersion lengths ( i.e. , in linear propagation the pulse will broaden about 100 times ) , @xmath42 nonlinear lengths , and @xmath43 diffraction lengths . for energies below 0.3 nj the pulse disperses , and it is difficult to measure the autocorrelation of the output pulse .",
    "results of launching a 0.5-nj pulse illustrate soliton formation ( figure [ 500pjex ] ) .",
    "after propagation through the fiber , the pulse is compressed temporally ( figure [ 500pjex](a ) ) and the spectrum becomes structured ( figure [ 500pjex](b ) ) .",
    "the mfd at the end of the grin fiber is 17.9 @xmath40 m ( figure [ 500pjex](d ) ) . at higher energies , the output pulse duration decreases , and the spectrum broadens and red - shifts ( figure [ results](a ) ) , in a manner immediately reminiscent of soliton self - frequency shifting @xcite .",
    "we can conveniently analyze the experimental results using the results of the variational approach .",
    "the dependence of pulse duration on pulse energy is predicted well by the fixed point ( figure [ results](b ) ) : the best fit is obtained with a mfd of 17.4 @xmath40 m , which is close to the measured value of 17.9 @xmath40 m . for the spectral shift",
    "we apply the results of standard soliton perturbation theory .",
    "the wavelength shift is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the pulse duration @xcite : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is distance and @xmath46 is related to the slope of the raman gain spectrum .",
    "the pulse duration is inversely proportional to the energy , so the wavelength shift should be proportional to the fourth power of the energy .",
    "indeed this is the case ( figure [ results](c ) ) : the best fit is obtained with @xmath47 fs , which is close to the accepted value of 3 fs for silica fiber .",
    "the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are coupled through the kerr nonlinearity in a multimode waveguide .",
    "the picture that emerges from the theoretical and experimental results presented above is that a 3-component soliton forms with nonlinear pulse propagation .",
    "that is , the process that is responsible for compensation of group - velocity dispersion in time also compensates for the separation of the different spatial modes ( modal dispersion ) .    .",
    "( c ) measured peak wavelength vs. pulse energy ( symbols ) and fit to equation [ sfseq].,width=302 ]    the spatial evolution of the solitons in grin fiber has a significant linear contribution , as expected with a waveguide . however , the system differs significantly from a single - mode waveguide because the spatial dimensions have the freedom to play a major role .",
    "therefore , it is surprising that , on average ( ignoring spatial oscillations ) , the resulting solutions are equivalent to single - mode solitons propagating in the fundamental mode of the fiber .",
    "this is noteworthy considering that the system includes multiple modes ( equation [ coupledeq ] ) , and is modeled by a three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( equation [ 3deq ] ) .",
    "experimentally , measurements of the beam propagation on a sub - millimeter length scale will be valuable to confirm the presence of multiple transverse modes , but we are unable to make such measurements with adequate accuracy . while the analyses presented above clearly account well for the experiments , we can not absolutely rule out an alternative explanation .",
    "although the models would become quite complex , raman scattering could be incorporated directly , rather than treated as a perturbation .",
    "in such a model , the interplay of linear mode coupling ( which distributes energy uniformly among modes ) and raman scattering could result in energy being `` siphoned '' into the fundamental mode of the fiber @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of this process would be noteworthy in its own right .",
    "we hope that the results presented here stimulate efforts to address this intriguing spatiotemporal problem .",
    "regardless of the final theoretical interpretation , the observation of optical solitons and soliton self - frequency shifting in a grin waveguide has implications for a variety of scientific and technological issues .",
    "grin media offer a stable and convenient setting for the study of spatiotemporal wave propagation , with solutions that also pertain to bose - einstein condensates .",
    "soliton transmission in multimode fibers relaxes the stringent coupling requirements for single - mode systems , and thereby could reduce the cost of high - data - rate telecommunication systems @xcite .",
    "grin solitons will be pertinent to current efforts to reach the shannon limit @xcite through space - division multiplexing @xcite .",
    "in such systems , cross - talk can be minimized by utilizing modes that do not overlap spatially as channels .",
    "finally , the linear scaling of soliton energy and power with core diameter will benefit applications in high - power lasers and pulse transmission @xcite . for example",
    ", commercially - available grin fiber with 1-mm core diameter will allow transmission of 100-kw solitons .",
    "for the coupled equation simulations , @xmath48 nm , e @xmath49 nj , @xmath50 m@xmath23/w , @xmath51 , @xmath52 fs@xmath23/cm , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 @xmath40 m . an overlap - integral calculation with a 10-@xmath40 m gaussian input reveals that @xmath20 of the energy is accounted for with 3 modes ( @xmath55 in @xmath56 , @xmath57 in @xmath58 , and @xmath59 in @xmath60 ) . in linear propagation , the pulse in the @xmath58 mode moves away from the pulse in the fundamental mode at a rate of 33 fs / m ( 99 fs / m for @xmath60 ) .",
    "we use a split - step fourier - transform method to numerically solve equation [ 3deq ] . with 1024 points in time and 512 in space , and",
    "a 100-@xmath40 m step in the propagation direction , simulation of pulse propagation through 52 m of fiber requires 20 days of computation using four cores on an intel i7 computer .",
    "the parameters used for the simulations are the same as those for the coupled system , with an effective length of 11.8 @xmath40 m for the y dimension .",
    "experiments were performed at 1550-nm wavelength where the group - velocity dispersion of fused silica is anomalous .",
    "an erbium - doped fiber oscillator ( 11 mhz repetition rate ) operating in the normal - dispersion regime produces @xmath38-fs pulses with @xmath61-nj pulse energy .",
    "the oscillator is followed by 80 m of normal - dispersion fiber stretcher , a single - mode amplifier , and a transmission grating compressor in a standard chirped - pulse amplifier configuration .",
    "the output is aligned into a smf-28 fiber pigtailed collimator of 50-cm length , which allows for near ideal seeding conditions when it is spliced directly to the grin fiber ( thorlabs gif625 ) .",
    "after all losses due to the grating compressor and coupling into the collimator , this setup allows for up to @xmath39 nj at a dechirped duration of @xmath38 fs .",
    "the pulse is directly measured with a 2-photon intensity autocorrelator , the spectrum is measured with a grating spectrometer with @xmath62-nm resolution , and the beam is measured with an ingaas camera with a 111x beam expander to fill the detector array .",
    "the mfd is measured by averaging the widths of a gaussian fit of the x and y cross - sections at the center of the beam .",
    "the pulse duration as a function of energy for the pulses after the grin fiber are measured by taking the full - width at half - maximum duration of an intensity autocorrelation and dividing by the correlation factor for a sech@xmath23 intensity profile ( 1.543 ) .",
