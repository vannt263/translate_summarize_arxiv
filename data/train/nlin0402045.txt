    "chemical pattern formation results typically from the interplay of reaction and diffusion and occurs in many reactions in solutions and gels @xcite and in heterogeneous catalysis @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion processes are also believed to be at the heart of morphogenesis in biological systems @xcite .",
    "rotating spiral waves are probably the most typical structures investigated so far .",
    "they have been found initially in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite . since then , they have been frequently observed in a variety of experimental setups including aggregation of slime molds @xcite , catalytic co oxidation @xcite , cardiac tissue @xcite , and intracellular calcium dynamics in frog eggs @xcite , and glycolytic activity in extracts of yeast cells @xcite .",
    "spirals that organize the surrounding medium by regular emission of waves are well established under both oscillatory and excitable conditions .",
    "if several spirals populate the system then the waves emitted by neighbouring spirals annihilate each other at the boundary of the spirals s spatial domains .",
    "such boundaries constitute wave sinks .",
    "intuition tell us that these passive objects ( where waves arrive and die ) do not influence the medium beyond its closest surrounding .",
    "recently , vanag and epstein reported on experiments of the oscillatory belousov - zhabotinsky reaction in an aerosol ot microemulsion ( bz - aot )  @xcite . in their quasi two - dimensional system chemical concentration patterns",
    "are arranged as so - called `` antispirals '' or `` antitargets '' .",
    "typical snapshots of the system display closely packed domains each containing a single antispiral .",
    "as time progresses the concentration waves propagate _ towards _ the center of the respective antispiral",
    ". such inward propagation seemingly contradicts our intuition of spiral cores as wave sources .",
    "a word of caution towards the terminology of spirals and antispirals is in place here : spirals and antispirals are not structures that can appear simultaneously for given parameters .",
    "instead , they occur in different complementary regions of the parameter space .",
    "the terminology of antispirals used here is rather recent and occurs only after the cited experimental paper , that is more careful and talks of inwardly rotating spiral waves .",
    "it should also be stressed that many authors have found ( what is now often called ) antispirals or antitargets in numerical simulations in continuous and discrete oscillatory and chaotic media and simply classified them as spirals or targets see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "more recent reports have adapted the new name antispiral in the sense it is used here @xcite .",
    "the distinction achieved here by the prefix anti is sometimes also referred to as positive dispersion ( spiral ) and negative dispersion ( antispiral ) @xcite .    since",
    ", the phenomena of antispirals and antitargets occur frequently in the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite , they should be generic in oscillatory media near onset . what comes as a surprise is rather that over so many years only spirals have been observed and the first experimental report of an antispiral occured only very recently @xcite .",
    "this experiment lead to a discussion about the `` mechanism '' of antispirals .",
    "vanag and epstein suggested that the phenomenon may be related to a hopf bifurcation with finite wavenumber ( wave bifurcation ) in a extended oregonator model , where they find group and phase velocities with opposite signs .",
    "simulations and experiments show also `` packet waves '' , which are wave groups that move in opposite direction to the motion of the constituting waves @xcite . while this argument seems valid for the quasi one - dimensional packet waves , it does , in our opinion , not apply to the two - dimensional case under consideration .",
    "after all , near a wave bifurcation in a two - dimensional medium , one typically observes traveling or standing stripes or hexagons and not spiral waves .",
    "earlier on , nicola _",
    "et al . _ have reported related wave groups near a turing - wave bifurcation and named them `` drifting pattern domains '' @xcite .",
    "gong and christini have recently investigated the cgle and prototypical two - component reaction - diffusion ( rd ) models and conjectured that antispirals only occur near the onset of oscillations @xcite",
    ". we will provide further evidence for their claim .",
    "they also suggest an analytical argument and criterion for the appearance of antispirals in the cgle coefficients .",
    "recently , we have shown that the criterion for the occurrence of antispirals in rd models has to be modified and that antispirals in the corresponding cgle may turn out to be spirals in the original rd model @xcite . here",
    "we present the complete analytical derivation of the differing criteria for antispirals in the cgle and in the corresponding rd models .",
    "when studying dynamical phenomena in rd models near the onset of pattern formation then the analysis of the corresponding amplitude equation can be instructive @xcite .",
    "the cgle represents the amplitude equation for pattern dynamics near the onset of oscillations via supercritical hopf bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the cgle for arbitrary rd systems is obtained following exact transformation rules @xcite . here , we validate our criterion for antispirals in rd systems for two simple reaction - diffusion ( rd ) systems : the fitzhugh - nagumo and brusselator models by deriving the cgle coefficients for these models , applying our criterion for antispirals and comparing the result to direct numerical simulations near a hopf bifurcation . in the cgle , domains of the parameter space can be classified according to the relative directions ( signs ) of phase- and group - velocities in rotating waves ( spirals or antispirals ) in line with arguments which y. kuramoto and t. tsuzuki used first to analyse wave sources of the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xcite .",
    "boundaries of the parameter domains are given by zero phase or group velocities which yields analytical criteria .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of both rd models analysed here , corroborate this criterion s prediction near the onset of oscillations and extend it when the model s parameters are driven away form threshold .",
    "the simulations also suggest that antispirals typically disappear far away from the onset of oscillations .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in the next section we will discuss theoretically the distinction between spirals and antispirals within the cgle framework and analytically derive the criterion for either occurrence in rd models near the onset of oscillations . in the third section we explore spirals and antispirals in two rd models near and far from the onset of oscillations .",

    "it is seen that the prediction based in the cgle description is valid only in the vicinity of the hopf threshold . as the distance to this threshold increases",
    "the antispirals are turned into spirals .",
    "in this paper we emphasise the fact that the essential difference between spirals and antispirals is the sign of phase velocity of the travelling waves emanating from the core region and that phase and group velocity do not necessarily have to point into the same direction .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that spirals and antispirals can not occur simultaneously .",
    "they appear in different regions of the parameter - space .",
    "we have shown that spirals and antispirals are related by a simple symmetry transformation in the parameter space of the cgle and derived a criterion for the cgle coefficients , namely @xmath136 , that predicts the existence of antispirals in the respective rd model near a hopf instability . in the cgle parameter space ,",
    "antispirals appears as frequently as spirals .",
    "spirals and antispirals are found in complementary regions of the paramter space and are characterized by the selection of positive and negative wavenumbers , respectively . at the boundary between antispirals and spirals , the selected wavenumber is zero and the selected wavelength diverges .",

    "the analysis of both models suggests that to get antispirals it is necessary that the inhibitor also diffuses .",

    ". we have also performed numerical simulations of both models near and far form the oscillatory instability threshold .",
    "antispirals are quite likely to appear near the hopf bifurcation but turn into regular spirals far into the oscillatory where the amplitude of waves becomes large .",
    "both examples show that the assumption that the 1d spiral analog gives a good approximation of the spiral - antispiral transition behaviour not only near onset but also moderately far from it . in a more general distinction ,",
    "antispirals emit phase waves that are typical for oscillatory media .",
    "in contrast , trigger waves common in excitable media should always have the same sign of group and phase velocity .",
    "since the distinction between trigger and phase waves is not sharp , we can not make a general statement about the possibility of antispirals in excitable media , but expect that they will be quite hard to find therein .",
    "the rarity of experimental observations of antispirals suggests that most experiments exhibiting spirals are conducted either far away from the oscillatory threshold or under excitable resp .",

    "it is tempting to explain the experiment of vanag and epstein @xcite from the proximity of the control parameters to a hopf bifurcation , though other more complicated possibilities can not be ruled out at this stage .    finally , we like to stress the most essential point in the consideration of the nature of spirals and antispirals .",
    "the crucial quantity for both structures is the group velocity of the periodic waves outside the core region . in all models",
    "considered , the group velocity is pointing outward from the spiral core as has been shown analytically for the cgle .",
    "the distinction between spirals and antispirals stems only from the sign of the phase velocities and the corresponding phenomenological impression . in our opinion",
    "is it important not to confuse the distinction between spirals and antispirals with the distinction between sinks and sources .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the definition of a source depends only on the group velocities and not at all on the phase velocity of the periodic waves far away from it @xcite .",
    "counting arguments show that sources belong typically to a zero - parameter family while sinks are members of a two parameter family @xcite . in other words , sources select frequency and wavelength of the emitted periodic waves , while sinks simply appear where two wavetrains of arbitrary wavelength and period happen to meet . a classification of defects in reaction - diffusion media can be done according to the group velocities of periodic waves on both sides of the defect and the velocity of the defect itself . apart from sources and sinks ,",
    "one may also find transmission defects ( one - parameter family ) and contact defects in reaction - diffusion media @xcite . in the present context , spirals and antispirals are both sources , i. e. they select their frequency and wavelength and control their surroundings . if they were sinks ( as sometimes claimed in the literature ) , the waves had to be organized from the domain boundaries , which would require another unknown `` organizer '' structure .",
    "altogether , we have shown by combination of existing analytical arguments that antispirals are structures of similar nature as spirals and should hence be expected in many systems exhibiting phase waves in particular near the onset of oscillations .",
    "their experimental discovery can be nicely interpreted within the existing theoretical framework for oscillatory reaction - diffusion media .",

    "<S> spiral and antispiral waves are studied numerically in two examples of oscillatory reaction - diffusion media and analytically in the corresponding complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that both these structures are sources of waves in oscillatory media , which are distinguished only by the sign of the phase velocity of the emitted waves . using known analytical results in the cgle , we obtain a criterion for the cgle coefficients that predicts whether antispirals or spirals will occur in the corresponding reaction - diffusion systems . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this criterion to the fitzhugh - nagumo and brusselator models by deriving the cgle near the hopf bifurcations of the respective equations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the full reaction - diffusion equations confirm the validity of our simple criterion near the onset of oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> they also reveal that antispirals often occur near the onset and turn into spirals further away from it . the transition from antispirals to spirals </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by a divergence in the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> a tentative interpretaion of recent experimental observations of antispiral waves in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction in a microemulsion is given . </S>"
