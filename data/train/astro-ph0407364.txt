    "the issue of dark energy dynamics is perhaps the most pressing today in cosmology .",
    "there are claims both for and against dynamics ( bassett _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , alam _",
    "_ 2003 , jassal _",
    "but it is a subject dogged by gauge problems and @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in estimating the true value of an observable @xmath14 , such as @xmath15 . under a change in parametrisation",
    "the best estimate of @xmath14 will change to @xmath16 .",
    "this is a gauge artifact since the change in @xmath14 has nothing to do with the real universe .",
    "even worse , since the two parametrisations will usually be rather different we have no guarantee that @xmath17 will be small . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "claims for dynamics ( or the lack thereof ) can be pure gauge artifacts , mirages induced by the parametrisations that are unrelated to the data .",
    "for example , riess _",
    "( 2004 ) and jassal _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) claim that current sn - ia data are inconsistent with rapid evolution of dark energy .",
    "such conclusions must always implicitely refer to a finite dimensional subspace of the full dark energy model space , and broadening the class of models studied can ( and in this case does ) lead to complete reversal of such conclusions .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) provides a explicit counter - example .",
    "the aim of compression is to summarise , as aggressively as possible , the key features of dark energy properties in a few parameters and to facilitate discrimination between models .",
    "we will see that standard expansions fail to achieve either of these goals , even when they are extended to higher order .",
    "the main result of this work is that compression of the dark energy space into low - dimensional subspaces , while convenient and easy to work with , can give seriously misleading results . since these results are used in the design of upcoming surveys it is bad news for cosmology in general .",
    "if one does not impose the weak energy condition ( wec ) , @xmath18 , then the results can border on the completely useless .",
    "the rest of this article delimits , as precisely as possible , the quicksands and danger areas in the use of two - parameter compressions .    as a first sobering example , consider constraints on @xmath19 when we do not impose the wec .",
    "one - parameter studies give constraints such as @xmath20 at @xmath1 @xcite suggesting that a model with @xmath21 at @xmath22 would be ruled out at more than @xmath23 .",
    "instead a little thought makes it clear that if @xmath19 can vary freely then _ there is no lower bound on @xmath24 _ for @xmath25 since this merely changes how fast the already irrelevant and rapidly diminishing dark energy density decreases .",
    "if the rapid drop in @xmath24 occurs at @xmath4 this leaves essentially no observable trace @xcite .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the likelihoods in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) which allow for @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "how can we hope to cover such possibilities with simple one or two parameter compressions ?",
    "the dark energy literature overflows with one , two and higher - dimensional compressions of @xmath28 , e.g. ( efstathiou 1999 ; huterer and turner 2001 ; weller and albrecht 2002 ; bassett et al .",
    "2002 ; corasaniti and copeland 2002 ; linder 2003 ; jassal _ et al . _ 2004 ) .",
    "compressions also exist for @xmath29 @xcite while decorrelated reconstructions of @xmath28 have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most basic parametrisation , namely describing the dark energy with a constant equation of state @xmath30 , is well - known to introduce a severe bias ( see for instance maor _",
    "_ 2002 , virey _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) in parameter estimation .",
    "compressions invoking two parameters which somewhat alleviate this problem have been introduced in @xcite . however , as we will see , these models all struggle to describe rapid evolution .",
    "this is not surprising . with two parameters",
    "one may fix @xmath24 at @xmath31 and @xmath24 at high @xmath8 , but one can do nothing about the time nor the rapidity of the transition between the two extremes .",
    "caldwell and doran ( 2004 ) circumvented this by considering thirteen different one and two - parameter models , some exhibiting rapid transitions .",
    "the use of more than two parameters offers the opportunity to test the dark energy evolution with different data sets and consistently account for the dark energy perturbations at _ all _ redshifts ( bassett _ et al_. 2002 ; corasaniti and copeland 2002 ; corasaniti _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) but is , of course , more computationally intensive , and care must be taken to accurately capture the dark energy dynamics of rapid transitions ; see appendix c of ( corasaniti _ et al .",
    "for our study we consider two distinct classes of compressions .",
    "first are standard taylor expansions of @xmath28 and second is the _ kink _ , a physically - motivated compression .",
    "the taylor expansions are all of the form : @xmath32 where we consider four different choices for the ` expansion ' functions , @xmath33 .",
    "namely : @xmath34    to linear order ( @xmath35 ) these were first discussed by huterer and turner ( 2001 ) & weller and albrecht ( 2002 ) , chevallier and polarski ( 2000 ) and linder ( 2003 ) , and efstathiou ( 1999 ) for the redshift , scale - factor and logarithmic expansion functions respectively .",
    "later we will consider their performance at higher order ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the kink , on the other hand , is not an expansion .",
    "it is a 4-parameter model which accurately captures the behaviour of quintessence ( bassett _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , corasaniti and copeland 2002 , corasaniti _ et al .",
    "the extra parameters allow us to model very rapid transitions in @xmath28 , a freedom we will need : @xmath37 @xmath38 is the scale factor , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the present and matter - dominated values of the dark energy equation of state , @xmath41 is the value of the scale factor at the transition from @xmath40 to @xmath39 and @xmath42 controls the width of the transition .",
    "other formulations of the kink , with relative merits , are discussed in appendix a of corasaniti _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "there are other parametrisations but these are the most widely used today and lessons learned from these compressions will apply to many others in the literature .",
    "in this section we investigate whether the different parametrisations above give rise to different best - fits to current type ia supernova ( sn - ia ) data .",
    "recently @xmath43 new sn - ia at redshift @xmath44 have been discovered using the hubble space telescope , providing further evidence for a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion in the past@xcite .    in order to be conservative",
    "we use only the gold sample of @xcite , containing @xmath45 data points . in our analysis",
    "we assume a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe . the assumption of flatness is required to achieve reasonable error bars ( c.f .",
    "kunz and bassett 2004 ; dicus and repko 2004 ) .",
    "fortunately this is now a data - driven assumption and particularly harmless for this study since we are primarily interested in testing compressions rather than deriving constraints",
    ". we will also assume the prior @xmath46 .",
    "this can be justified from cmb data , as shown in kunz _",
    "( 2003 ) and corasaniti _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) , the best - fit values for background flrw parameters are not affected strongly by dark energy dynamics .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the solution to the continuity equation @xmath50 our analysis methods are described in detail in corasaniti _",
    "we use a markov - chain monte carlo code to find the constraints on the dark energy parameters for each parametrisation . as usual",
    "we marginalise analytically over the normalisation of @xmath51 which takes care of the hubble constant as well , leaving @xmath52 as the only remaining parameter apart from those describing the equation of state .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the marginalised one - dimensional likelihoods for the parameters of the dark energy compressions .",
    "the main point of that figure is that the various parametrisations have similar likelihoods _ at the same order _ , but that the likelihoods at different orders are completely different . here by order we mean the maximum value of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ taylor ] ) . hence  linear \" or  first - order \" ( @xmath35 ) refers to the standard two - parameter expansions with only @xmath54 non - zero , while 2nd - order corresponds to @xmath55 and has non - zero @xmath56 .",
    "the best - fit values and @xmath57 errors for the first - order redshift , scale factor and logarithmic parametrisations are given in table [ tab1 ] ; these are consistent with those found in ( feng et al .",
    "2004 ; gong 2004 ) .",

    "models with @xmath19 outside those limits are therefore expected to be `` bad '' fits to the sn - ia data .",
    "we plot the result in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "for the two - parameter models , the limits are very similar to those obtained by marginalising over all other parameters , as is expected since they are nearly gaussian .",
    "we have also checked that they coincide with limits from gaussian error propagation .",
    "we now discuss the constraints derived from the kink formula , eq .",
    "( [ bcc ] ) .",
    "the best fit to the data has a @xmath66 and is characterized by : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , corresponding to a rapidly varying equation of state with a transition from @xmath40 to @xmath39 at @xmath71 .",
    "this best - fit is shown in figure [ fig6 ] and clearly exits the @xmath1 limits from the two - parameter compressions , first from below at @xmath72 and then from above , at @xmath73 .",
    "this graphically illustrates the limitations of the standard parametrisations and shows how they artificially rule out models which should give the strongest signals for dark energy dynamics @xcite .",
    "although the kink formula is by construction everywhere under control , the dependence on its parameters is highly non - linear so the peaks of the marginalised likelihood distributions do not match the values of the best fit model .",
    "in fact the peaks of the @xmath74-dimensional marginalised likelihoods are shifted with the respect to the best fit values after marginalising .",
    "hence the marginalised likelihoods do not coincide with the maximized ones , as they would if the likelihood distributions were gaussian .",
    "it is not just one good fit to the data which violates the @xmath1 limits of all the two - parameter compressions either .",
    "for instance , the model with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 has @xmath79 , while the model with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , has @xmath84 .",
    "both are excellent fits to the data but are supposedly ruled out by the @xmath35 , linear redshift , scale - factor and logarithmic parametrisations of equations ( [ lin]-[log ] ) .",
    "the conclusion that rapid evolution of dark energy is ruled out by current data is therefore a ` gauge ' artifact .",
    "we have shown that rapid variations of the dark energy equation of state are perfectly consistent with , and in fact provide better fits to the gold sample than do models without rapid transitions .",
    "this conclusion remains even after including cmb and large scale structure data ( corasaniti _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) .",
    "the pathological behaviour of ruling out models which are very good fits to the data can be rectified by the inclusion of higher order terms , @xmath85 . indeed ,",
    "since the data allow @xmath58 to be large in all cases , higher order terms in the redshift , scale - factor and log expansions can not be neglected .",
    "therefore we have extended our analysis in order to include second order corrections @xmath86 to eq .",
    "( [ lin])-([log ] ) .    comparing the yellow likelihoods in figure [ fig2 ] with the red ones we see that by the allowed values of @xmath39 are shifted significantly towards more negative values , consistent with , but broader than the kink confidence interval .",
    "secondly huge values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are consistent with the data .",
    "this suggests that strong dark energy dynamics is not ruled out and that higher order terms _ must _ be taken into account . as mentioned in the introduction , this comes from the fact that @xmath58 and @xmath56 are strongly degenerate in all cases and that there is no lower bound on @xmath24 at @xmath4 , illustrating the huge effect of imposing the weak energy condition @xmath89 .",
    "in this case we have both a lower bound ( from the weak energy condition ) and an upper bound ( from the data ) on @xmath24 .",
    "as the second order parametrisations are described by a parabola in their respective expansion variables , they end up being strongly constrained .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have also considered much higher order ( @xmath90 ) , and found that severe internal degeneracies lead to finely balanced coefficients .",
    "thus a taylor expansion in @xmath8 becomes very unstable at high redshift , and even expansions in @xmath91 can hardly be called `` under control '' anywhere since the expansion coefficients become of order @xmath92 .      in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we report the values of the @xmath93 for the best fit models of each parametrisation . as we can see the four - parameter kink formula has the lowest @xmath93 , followed by the scale - factor , the logarithmic and redshift parametrisation .",
    "accounting for second order terms ( @xmath55 ) in the expansions provide fits even better than the best kink parametrisation which is non - trivial since they have one less parameter , although now the allowed parameter space volume is huge .    at this point",
    "we can ask how many parameters are actually necessary to describe the dark energy with current sn - ia data ? following liddle ( 2004 ) , we compute the akaike information criterion ( akaike 1974 ) @xmath94 and bayesian information criterion ( schwarz 1978 ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the maximum likelihood , @xmath97 is the number of model parameters and @xmath98 is the number of data points .",
    "we also compute the bayesian evidence @xmath99 ( sivia 1996 ; saini , weller and bridle 2004 ) , both with thermodynamic integration and nested sampling ( skilling 2004 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that fully degenerate parameters do not contribute to the evidence , so that specifically the kink model is less disfavored than the number of parameters suggests naively . for the same reason we find that @xmath99 grows very slowly when going to even higher order in the expansion - type parametrisations , although these cases are already disfavored by bayesian statistics .",
    "the preferred parametrisation is @xmath100cdm  it is indeed remarkable that a model with a single free parameter fits the data so well .",

    "given the importance of accurately estimating @xmath102 this variance forcefully argues for the need to go beyond two - dimensional parametrisations in handling future , high - quality data .    as a second point",

    "we leave this issue for future work .",
    "this _ letter _ shows the limitations of standard one and two - parameter compressions of the infinite dimensional space of dark energy models .",
    "we have highlighted the dangers in using constraints derived using these parametrisations , particularly regarding the possibility of rapid evolution in the dark energy , which none of the standard compressions can follow , and in defining allowed regions of parameter space which are completely wrong in the case where the weak energy condition ( @xmath113 ) is not imposed .",
    "rapid evolution provides a superlative fit to current sn - ia data ( as measured by @xmath93 ) , despite claims to the contrary in the literature which were based on two - parameter compressions .",
    "indeed , all of the two - parameter expansions we studied wrongly rule out such rapid evolution at @xmath1 or more .",
    "this is extremely damning evidence , especially since these compressions are typically used in the planning for the next - generation experiments which will provide data of significantly higher quality .",
    "in addition , the standard parametrisations also miss the fact that @xmath24 has no lower - bound at @xmath4 if the weak energy condition is not imposed , artifically cutting - out vast swaths of parameter space due to their innate limitations .",
    "further problems occur in estimating the redshift at which the universe began accelerating , @xmath102 .",
    "there is a nearly 300% variation in the best - fit for @xmath102 , depending on parametrisation .",
    "interestingly , all the tested parametrisations gave best - fits for @xmath102 below that of @xmath100cdm , providing unusual cross - parametrisation evidence for dark energy dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , use of the bayesian information criteria for model selection prefers the cosmological constant over the other models which remains the model to beat .",
    "the severe inadequacy of the standard two - parameter expansions lead us to consider higher - order terms ( @xmath85 ) with one of more extra parameters , e.g. @xmath56 . while this brings the rapid evolution models within the allowed region of parameter space it leads to severe degeneracies ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) which may make the parametrisations impotent for constraining the space of theoretical dark energy models , particularly when @xmath114 .    for completeness",
    "we have also compared four standard parametrisations against a test - bed of quintessence models ( appendix ) and found that while the kink and scale - factor expansion are excellent , the expansions in @xmath8 and @xmath115 can lead to large errors for @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that confidence intervals inferred from standard two - parameter expansions often do not deserve that name and are typically untrustworthy , even with current data .",
    "the wealth and quality of dark energy data we will aquire over the next decade will demand significantly better performance .",

    "<S> standard two - parameter compressions of the infinite dimensional dark energy model space show crippling limitations even with current sn - ia data . </S>",
    "<S> firstly they can not cope with rapid evolution - our best - fit to the latest sn - ia data shows late and very rapid evolution to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however all of the standard parametrisations ( incorrectly ) claim that this best - fit is ruled out at more than @xmath1 primarily because they track it well only at very low redshift , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> further they incorrectly rule out the observationally compatible region @xmath3 for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly the parametrisations give wildly different estimates for the redshift of acceleration , which vary from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> although these failings are largely cured by including higher - order terms ( @xmath7 parameters ) this results in new degeneracies and opens up large regions of previously ruled - out parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> finally we test the parametrisations against a suite of theoretical quintessence models . </S>",
    "<S> the widely used linear expansion in @xmath8 is generally the worst , with errors of up to @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> all of this casts serious doubt on the usefulness of the standard two - parameter compressions in the coming era of high - precision dark energy cosmology and emphasises the need for decorrelated compressions with at least three parameters . </S>"
