    "exceptional points ( eps ) represent defective points occurring in the parameter space of some finite - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath4 at which two ( or possibly more ) of the system eigenvalues coalesce while , simultaneously , the usual self - adjoint property of the hamiltonian fails to hold @xcite .",
    "eps serve to characterize the qualitative aspects of the spectrum in their vicinity and have been studied in a wide array of physical contexts , including experimental studies of the field modes in a microwave cavity @xcite as well as a chaotic optical microcavity @xcite . in the context of scattering theory an ep",
    "at which two eigenvalues coalesce appears as a double pole of the s - matrix ; for examples see the analysis of nuclear spectra , laser - induced continuum structures in atoms and the transmission through quantum dots that is reported in the review @xcite .",
    "further theoretical studies of exceptional points in various physical contexts include superconducting wires @xcite , electron scattering on helium @xcite , photodissociation of @xmath5 @xcite , the hydrogen spectrum under crossed electric and magnetic fields @xcite , the scattering of a beam of particles in a double barrier potential @xcite , and nuclear spectra studies relying on random matrix theory @xcite . a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) interpretation has also been offered based on a coulomb interaction analogy for the eps @xcite .    in physical situations",
    "the finite hamiltonian @xmath4 is usually embedded in a much larger system ( i.e. open quantum system ( oqs ) ) such that the discrete spectrum of @xmath4 is perturbed by the continuous degrees of freedom associated with the larger system .",
    "the continuum might represent a measuring device , such as the leads used to probe the cavity modes in refs .",
    "note , however , that the eps in this case are not merely shifted from those of the discrete space by itself ; in fact , the interaction with the continuum in general gives rise to a greater number of eps inhabiting an effective finite - dimensional hamiltonian with dimension larger than @xmath4 alone ( we demonstrate this subtle point for our prototype model below ) .",
    "here we propose a method for the discovery and spectral analysis of eps in oqs .",
    "this analysis incorporates a certain eigenvalue expansion that generically occurs in the vicinity of any ep @xcite .",
    "further , we offer our own qpt analogy that relates to the emergence of the resonant state in an open system and hence acts as a mechanism for spontaneous time - symmetry breaking in nature , with critical exponents given by this eigenvalue expansion .",
    "while we will demonstrate this process for a specific example , we emphasize that a similar effect occurs in many more general oqs models .",
    "the hamiltonian we have in mind may be generically written as @xmath6 ; here @xmath7 gives the continuum ( open ) component of the system coupled to a discrete level or series of levels @xmath4 through the coupling hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath9 , in which the discrete component is written in terms of a single level coupled to the continuum via @xmath10 with @xmath11 a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "however , we make this specification with the understanding that this single level may simply be one particular discrete level , with others absorbed into @xmath7 , and the general ideas from our analysis below still applies in the case of multiple levels @xcite .",
    "we assume that no many - body interactions are present .",
    "this hamiltonian ( or close generalizations ) may be applied in the description of a wide range of physical phenomena , for example the interaction of a two - level oscillator with the field modes in a waveguide @xcite or the effect of a quantum dot impurity on quantum wires @xcite and has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "we comment on the expected general applicability of our method below .    defining the green s function @xmath12 we obtain the discrete spectrum for @xmath13 as the poles of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the eigenvector of @xmath4 with the eigenvalue @xmath16 . for the simplest cases",

    "while our method is oriented towards analytically solvable models , it nevertheless should prove useful in some numerical situations assuming that we may at least explicitly write the self - energy function @xmath19 in integral form . further , our method should in principle be portable to other oqs such as the scattering problem in ref .",

    "the coalescence occurs because the two eigenvalues share a common branch cut in the complex parameter space .",
    "the branch cut is described by the system discriminant @xmath27 , which is obtained in the case of a closed system from the determinant of the finite hamiltonian ; in the case of an oqs we may obtain @xmath27 as the determinant of a finite - dimensional effective hamiltonian @xmath28 that describes the spectrum in the discrete subspace ( @xmath28 may be obtained by applying the feshbach projection operator technique @xcite or by other methods @xcite as we demonstrate in app .",

    "we can expand this new function @xmath157 in an ordinary taylor series in @xmath156 and then use the reverse parameter transformation to write the original eigenenergies as @xmath158 with @xmath159 for comparison with eq .",

    "this expression provides the realization of the generic expansion eq .",

    "as a final comment on the eps in oqs , we hypothesize a qpt analogy for the emergence of irreversibility at the eps where the resonance appears .",
    "this analogy is similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the decay rate @xmath161 is related to the order parameter .",
    "we use the ep @xmath74 as our example ; the analogy works out similarly for the negative side of the spectrum involving the ep @xmath73 .",
    "let us focus on the ` non - critical case ' @xmath131 , where @xmath162 are both real .",
    "here we have a pseudo - energy gap between the two anti - bound states given by @xmath163 as shown in eqs .",

    "we may carry the analogy further by defining a function that describes the correlations between the impurity site and an arbitrary chain site @xmath20 through the resonant state by @xmath166 where @xmath167 represents a contour in the complex @xmath55 plane that surrounds only the eigenvalue @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "we evaluate this to find @xmath168 we recall that on the ` non - critical ' side @xmath169 , @xmath112 is an anti - bound state with @xmath170 , giving purely real - valued correlations .",

    "this is reminiscent of the dynamical phase transition in ref .",
    "@xcite that occurs when a resonance state , coupled to a large number of otherwise similar resonance states , suddenly transitions from a narrow resonance to a wide resonance .",
    "the order parameter associated with this process is proportional to the resonance decay width , which suffers a discontinuity in the first derivative at the transition point .",
    "simultaneous with this transition , the wave function of this state `` collects all the corresponding components from the wave functions of all the other states . '' in the present case we instead have two anti - bound states ( zero decay width ) that spontaneously give rise at the ep to a resonance ( finite decay width ) and anti - resonance pair .",
    "meanwhile the correlations for the resonance appear similar to what we would find for the unperturbed @xmath98 states in the uncoupled model @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "hence the resonance state in some sense mimics the @xmath178 states , which are themselves nothing more than a collective oscillation of all the @xmath179 states in the original site basis . from eq .",
    "( [ corr.fcn.eval ] ) we now introduce an inverse correlation length on the critical side of the transition as @xmath180 ; further we note @xmath181 . since the decay width in this case also suffers a discontinuity in the first derivate at the ep",
    ", we interpret this as the order parameter varying as @xmath182 , which yields the dynamic exponent @xmath123 @xcite ; we propose that this exponent might be interpreted as representing the time dimension in which the symmetry is spontaneously broken with the appearance of exponential decay in association with the resonance state .",
    "we note our argument above does not rest on the details of the prototype model but rather on generic features associated with the complex eigenvalue ; for example a similar transition occurs for a quite different physical situation in ref . @xcite and our qpt analogy should directly apply in the systems studied in refs .",
    "indeed it seems that the resonant state in oqs should _ always _ appear at a real - valued ep described by the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ kato.puiseux ] ) .",
    "recently , an experimental demonstration of precisely this type of transition has been performed in an electronic system consisting of a coupled _ lrc _ circuit pair @xcite . in that system , one _",
    "lrc _ circuit is designed for amplification while the other provides a compensatory gain , resulting in a system with manifest parity - time @xmath41-symmetry @xcite . by varying the system parameters , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite are able to demonstrate a transition from real - valued eigenfrequencies ( the `` exact @xmath41-symmetric phase '' ) to complex eigenfrequencies ( the `` broken @xmath41-symmetric phase '' ) .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that although the hamiltonian for our prototype model given in eq .",
    "( [ ham.semi.site ] ) appears to be hermitian , there is however an underlying non - hermiticity associated with the continuum component of the system . on a deeper level",
    "the system is in fact @xmath41-symmetric rather than hermitian .",
    "this underlying @xmath41-symmetric nature is revealed for the present system by writing the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff ] ) ( also see @xmath28 re - written in terms of the @xmath98 variable in eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff.gen ] ) ) . indeed , applying the hermitian transformation on eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff.gen ] ) ( with @xmath183 for the prototype model ) reveals that the system is non - hermitian @xcite , and indeed the non - hermiticity comes from the lower - right entry for @xmath28 , which is the self - energy associated with the continuum .",
    "however , @xmath28 is indeed symmetric under the @xmath41 transformation .",
    "this underlying @xmath41-symmetric property is again a generic feature of oqs .",
    "in this paper we have presented the basic mathematical properties of exceptional points occurring in the spectrum of open quantum systems , along with a technique for their location and analysis in these systems .",
    "this technique includes our method for locating eps in oqs detailed in sec . [",
    "sec : anal.tech ] .",
    "while the location method we have presented is oriented towards analytically solvable models , it nevertheless may prove useful in some numerical situations assuming that we may at least explicitly write the self - energy function @xmath19 in integral form .",
    "we have also outlined our method to obtain the fractional power expansion given in generic form in eq .",
    "( [ kato.puiseux ] ) , which itself has been generalized from the expression appearing in kato s text ref .",
    "@xcite ( apparently this generalization is required to accommodate oqs , if perhaps not wider circumstances ) .",
    "we have further applied these techniques to the case of a semi - infinite chain with an endpoint impurity .",
    "we found that the resonant state eigenvalue emerges precisely at a real - valued ep , which should be a general result for oqs .",
    "further we offered a quantum phase transition analogy for the process in which one crosses this real - valued ep in parameter space . according to this analogy the decay width , which experiences a discontinuity in its first derivative at the ep , plays the role of order parameter .",
    "as the resonant state gives rise to time irreversibility via exponential decay , this appears to be related to the time - symmetry breaking mechanism in @xmath41-symmetric systems , including oqs .",
    "in order to keep our presentation reasonably self - contained , we briefly outline the method from ref . @xcite to obtain the effective hamiltonian reported in eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff ] ) from the full hamiltonian for our prototype model given in eq .",
    "( [ ham.semi.site ] ) .",
    "we start by writing the wavefunction along the chain in generic form as @xmath184 with @xmath185 an undetermined normalization constant . to solve the model from this point",
    "we find it useful to close the schrdinger equation on the right with an arbitrary bra @xmath186 to obtain @xmath187 in which @xmath13 is the full hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ ham.semi.site ] ) , while @xmath20 might represent the impurity site or any site along the chain @xmath188 .",
    "if we specify any site @xmath189 and plug eq .",
    "( [ ham.semi.site ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ x.generic.sch ] ) then , after applying the usual commutation relations , we find @xmath190 then plugging in eq .",
    "( [ semi.wave.fcn.c ] ) for the wave function we immediately find @xmath61 for the dispersion along the chain .",
    "next we solve for the normalization constant @xmath185 by choosing @xmath191 in eq .",
    "( [ x.generic.sch ] ) , which yields @xmath192 after applying @xmath61 here we re - arrange to find @xmath193 .    finally , evaluating eq .",
    "( [ x.generic.sch ] ) for the cases @xmath194 and @xmath195 we obtain the matrix equation @xmath196 in which @xmath197 is the discrete eigenvalue associated with the impurity sector . applying the transformation @xmath198 in the @xmath199 matrix on the lhs of this equation we find @xmath200 ,",
    "hence we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 reported in eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff ] ) in the main text .",
    "we now obtain the characteristic equation by solving @xmath201 , as reported in eq .",
    "( [ semi.disp ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we briefly comment on the number of solutions emerging from the characteristic equation under the effective hamiltonian treatment ( the reader should also consult app .",

    "let us consider a slightly more general form for @xmath28 of dimension two as @xmath202 ( compare this with @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ semi.h.eff.eqn ] ) for the semi - infinite chain model with an endpoint impurity ) .",
    "note that we may just as well solve the characteristic equation in terms of @xmath98 rather than @xmath55 by writing @xmath203 , which gives @xmath204 after applying the transformation @xmath205 for a tight - binding chain . making the replacement @xmath206 here and multiplying through by @xmath207 immediately yields a fourth order polynomial equation for @xmath208 , hence a general effective hamiltonian of dimension two",
    "should be expected to yield four discrete eigenvalues . from this point",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that adding a single discrete impurity site increases the dimension of @xmath28 by one and simultaneously introduces two new solutions to the characteristic equation .",
    "meanwhile , adding a new channel also increases the dimension of @xmath28 by one but also requires us to solve a second polynomial equation , hence doubling the total number of solutions after the increase in the dimension of the effective hamiltonian has already been taken into account",
