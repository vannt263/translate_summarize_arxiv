    "this is in accord with theoretical predictions based on various factorization approximations , albeit there are considerable uncertainties in theoretical predictions .",
    "being a penguin dominated process , the theoretical prediction for the branching ratio of @xmath0 is very sensitive to the so - called effective number of colors @xmath13 , which has been widely used in the old factorization approximations  @xcite .",
    "varying @xmath13 from 2 to @xmath14 , the predicted branching ratio lies in the range @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite . if one uses the improved qcd factorization method developed by beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda ( bbns )  @xcite ( where @xmath17 ) , one obtains @xmath18 , somewhat lower than the current world average despite large experimental uncertainties .",
    "another approach based on perturbative qcd yields the branching ratio of this decay at the level of @xmath19 within the sm  @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "in general , the time dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath22 ( or for any common cp eigenstates into which both @xmath20 and @xmath21 can decay ) measures two independent pieces of information  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 the angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the sm and any new physics contributions to the @xmath10 mixing angle ; we will assume the latter to be small .",

    "therefore new physics contibutions at one loop level might have a chance to compete with the sm contribution to @xmath85 .",
    "possible susy contributions involve @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 ) so that the relevant mass insertion parameter is @xmath88 .",

    "one could perform a similar study as presented below for the @xmath85 , but we do not pursue that here .    in the following , we will deduce that @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 ) insertions in gluino penguins generally provide contributions too small to cause an observable deviation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , unless gluino and squark masses are close to the current lower bounds .",
    "we will also find that higgs - mediated @xmath91 is not sufficient to explain the data once we impose the existing cdf limit on @xmath92 .",

    "including those corrections , or going to the bbns approach , can lead to very large asymmetries . on the other hand",

    "the flavor - changing in these diagrams is intrinsically tied to the usual , ckm - induced flavor changing of the sm .",

    "@xcite for a consistent definition of minimal flavor violation in two - higgs doublet models such as the mssm ) .",

    "( we will return to a more - minimal flavor violation when we discuss the higgs - mediated contributions in section  [ higgssec ] . )    but the general mssm is not minimally flavor violating . for a generic mssm a new source of flavor violation",
    "is introduced by the squark mass matrices , which usually can not be diagonalized in the same basis as the quark mass matrices .",
    "this means gluinos ( and other gauginos ) will have flavor - changing couplings to quarks and squarks , which implies fcncs which are mediated by gluinos and thus have strong interaction strengths . in order to analyse the phenomenology of these couplings , it is helpful to rotate the effects so that they occur in squark propagators rather than in couplings , and to parametrize them in terms of dimensionless parameters .",
    "we work in the usual mass insertion approximation ( mia )  @xcite , where the flavor mixing @xmath122 in the down type squarks associated with @xmath123 and @xmath124 are parametrized by @xmath125 .",

    "here @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are squark mass matrices , and @xmath132 is the average squark mass . then , the gluino box / penguin diagrams generate the qcd penguin operators , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "since the decay @xmath135 is dominated by the sm qcd penguin operators ( an example is shown in fig .",

    "but the gluino - mediated diagrams contribute to @xmath141 for all @xmath60 , independent of flavor .",
    "therefore one should check that these new sources of flavor changing do not contribute too much to other charmless @xmath31 decays such as @xmath142 , etc . in this paper",
    "we will not deal with this problem directly .",
    "but we note that there are known mechanisms by which this can be achieved . as an example , consider a scenario in which both @xmath2 and @xmath3 operators contribute to @xmath0 with nearly equal amplitudes .",
    "because vector mesons ( @xmath143 ) and pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath144 ) have opposite parity , the gluino loop effects appear as @xmath145 for the @xmath146 modes and @xmath147 for the @xmath148 modes , respectively .",
    "so one can suppress the gluino contributions to the @xmath148 modes by simply assuming @xmath149 , even if @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributions are sizable  @xcite .",

    "given the uncertainties inherent in the bbns or any other factorization scheme we feel that this is an appropriate approach .",

    "it is obvious that the @xmath3 case is essentially identical to the @xmath2 case in fig .",
    "[ llfig ] .",
    "there are two issues which are not obvious from the figures .",
    "first , as already indicated , the @xmath3 insertion contributes very little to @xmath186 .",
    "thus we have omitted a plot of the prediction of the direct cp violation in @xmath186 , @xmath207 , since it would differ little from the sm .",
    "secondly , for light gluinos and squarks , near their experimental limit , it is possible to get slightly lower values of @xmath42 for the @xmath3 insertion than it was for the @xmath2 ; this is because the @xmath2 insertions required to further push down @xmath42 are inconsistent with @xmath186 .",
    "a few general remarks on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 insertions are in order .",
    "first , we note that one requires a large 2 - 3 mixing in order to obtain any observable effect in @xmath42 .",
    "but for such large mixing , our mass insertion approximation is no longer valid .",
    "one must then consider the full vertex mixings in the @xmath275 couplings with squarks in the mass eigenstates , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the supergim suppression is less effective and the loop functions are enhanced , which could lead to somewhat larger effects on @xmath0 .",
    "if one considers a large 2 - 3 mixing in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 sector , an important constraint from @xmath10 mixing , which is proportional to @xmath88 , may also arise .",
    "since the sm contribution to @xmath276 is proportional to @xmath277 , the gluino loop contribution with light gluinos / squarks can easily dominate the sm , unless the @xmath3 or @xmath2 insertion for @xmath278 transition is very small . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of us discussed the allowed region for the @xmath279 insertion , imposing the measured @xmath276 , @xmath57 and @xmath280 .",
    "it was found that one needs @xmath281 even if we assume that the ckm angle @xmath215 is a completely free parameter .",
    "this should be compared to @xmath282 which is needed in order for the @xmath2 insertion to explain the observed shift in @xmath42 .",
    "it would be difficult , although not impossible , to build a flavor model where this is the case .",
    "the case of an @xmath5 insertion of the form @xmath283 is very different from that of either @xmath2 or @xmath3 . while @xmath2 , @xmath3 insertions can be @xmath284 , the parameters @xmath89 s must be small in order to avoid excessively large fcnc amplitudes in charmless nonleptonic @xmath31 decays .",
    "but this also implies that even small @xmath89 s can lead to observable effects in the @xmath31 sector .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath5 insertion is particularly simple , in part because it does not contribute to the penguin operators @xmath285 .",
    "but its contributions to the ( chromo)magnetic dipole operators can be quite large because it breaks the sm chiral symmetry in the @xmath104-quark sector allowing dipole operators to occur without the usual @xmath286 suppression , replaced instead with a susy - breaking @xmath243 insertion .",
    "thus , as previously noted , the @xmath5 insertion is much more strongly constrained by @xmath8 , roughly @xmath287 .",
    "however the same chiral symmetry breaking also ensures that the @xmath5 contributions to @xmath162 are likewise large , and so there may still be a residual effect on @xmath0 , both in its branching ratio and cp asymmetries .",

    "we impose this constraint by hatching the regions in which @xmath292 .",

    "[ lrfig](b ) indicates that the branching ratio for @xmath0 can in fact be greatly enhanced relative to the sm case .",
    "also note that @xmath42 can take any value between @xmath296 and 1 , even after we impose @xmath297 as a constraint .",
    "this is because the susy amplitude has a size similar to the sm amplitude so that the resulting branching ratio is not too different from the sm prediction .",

    "let us comment further on the sensitivity of our results to the methods used for calculating the hadronic amplitude .",
    "it is clear that the direct cp asymmetry @xmath49 depends very strongly on the method used for evaluating hadronic matrix elements .",
    "for example , one finds @xmath117 in naive factorization ( without one loop corrections to the matrix elements of four - quark operators ) , whereas it can take on values of @xmath284 in the bbns approach .",
    "the calculation of @xmath42 is also technique - dependent , though less so .",
    "different calculation schemes can produce values of @xmath42 which are different by factors of a few .",
    "for example , @xmath42 can go as negative as @xmath296 in the @xmath5 insertion case when we use the recent bbns approach , but when the same parameter space is studied using the techniques of lunghi and wyler  @xcite , @xmath42 only drops as negative as @xmath308 .",
    "we consider the bbns approach to be the most accurate and well - motivated available , which is why we use it , but view the differences between these schemes to be an unavoidable source of uncertainty at present .",
    "the final case to be considered is perhaps the most unusual .",
    "an @xmath6 insertion is of the form @xmath309 , coupling the rh strange squark to the lh bottom squark .",
    "our intuition from the sm would lead us to believe that such insertions would be small compared to @xmath5 insertions , naturally suppressed by @xmath310 . in susy models with minimal flavor violation , this is indeed the case .",
    "however , once one moves beyond minimal flavor violation there is no reason for the @xmath6 insertion to be particularly suppressed with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it has a phenomenology that is quite different than the @xmath5 insertions because it does not interfere with the sm contributions which are themselves of the @xmath5 form .",
    "( because of this , we had to extend the bbns approach to the case with opposite chirality 4-quark operators . ) a quick comparison of the results for the @xmath6 insertion in fig .",
    "[ rlfig ] to those of the @xmath5 in the last section should convince the reader of this easily .    though the @xmath6 insertion generates a wide range in @xmath293 like the @xmath5 case ( fig .",
    "[ rlfig](b ) ) , the similarities end there .",
    "because the @xmath6 insertions do not directly interfere with the sm , the allowed region for @xmath311 is centered around zero ( that is , only its square is relevant in most observables ) as seen in fig .  [",
    "rlfig](a ) .",
    "and although both cases can easily generate large , negative @xmath42 and negative @xmath49 , only in the @xmath5 case is the correlation completely clean . as we pointed in the previous section , an @xmath5 insertion with negative @xmath42 implies negative ( but not very large ) @xmath49 . for the @xmath6 case ,",
    "negative @xmath42 can be accompanied by @xmath49 of either sign ( fig .",

    "in fact , of all the cases we have considered so far , the @xmath6 case best fits the current data , for precisely this reason .    there is a particularly interesting variation on the @xmath6 theme that we now turn our attention towards .      thus far , in our calculations of @xmath186 we have made a simplifying assumption that can often be incorrect in realistic models .",
    "we have assumed that the calculation of @xmath186 consists entirely of a sm piece and gluino - induced susy pieces .",
    "however low - energy models of susy usually have several other , often large , contributions to @xmath186 , most particularly from charged higgs loops ( which add to the sm terms ) , and from chargino loops ( which subtract from the sm ) .",

    "however , we now wish to see how our results depend on the size and phase of @xmath352 and @xmath353 .",

    "theoretical uncertainties decrease quickly for heavier gluinos , and there is no possibility to get a negative @xmath42 for @xmath363gev within the mass insertion approximation .    in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors did claim to find negative @xmath42 without generating a large @xmath73 mass difference . in order to avoid a large @xmath7 ,",
    "a smaller value for the @xmath3 insertion was used . yet",
    "our results would indicate that a small @xmath3 insertion will not generate highly negative @xmath42 .",
    "the solutions to this paradox appears to lie in how the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite treated the hadronic uncertainties in the bbns prescription .",
    "in particular , they allowed @xmath364 and @xmath365 to take on values as large as 8 .",
    "it is not surprising that this 8-fold increase in the uncertainties allows for a much wider range for @xmath42 . on the other hand , at these extremes , the `` subleading '' corrections are no longer subleading , but are every bit as large as the leading terms in the bbns scheme . for our analysis we have felt it important to keep our theoretical uncertainties at the level of those proposed by bbns .",
    "it seems to us that doing otherwise it tantamount to claiming that the bbns prescription is not a good one .",
    "we have taken the opposite view in this paper .",
    "at large @xmath138 , fcncs can also be mediated by exchange of neutral higgs bosons , as found in @xmath366  @xcite , @xmath367  @xcite and @xmath368  @xcite , etc . in this paper",
    "we consider the same mechanism leading to @xmath369 . unlike the gluino mediated amplitudes , which generate flavor independent amplitudes for @xmath59 , the higgs exchange diagrams generate flavor - dependent amplitudes since the higgs coupling is proportional to the yukawa couplings . therefore @xmath9 can be modified by a significant amount , whereas @xmath370 or @xmath371 remain essentially unchanged",
    ". thus decays such as @xmath372 can be affected by higgs exchange , whereas @xmath373 , @xmath374 modes are not .    in the presence of higgs - mediated fcncs ( fig .",
    "[ figone](c ) ) , new operators @xmath375 and @xmath376 appear in the @xmath377 effective hamiltonian : @xmath378\\ ] ] where @xmath379 where the first index @xmath58 or @xmath380 denotes the chirality of the initial @xmath104 quark in the @xmath31 meson , and color is conserved pairwise .",
    "in the mssm with minimal flavor violation , the wilson coefficients @xmath381 and @xmath382 are suppressed relative to @xmath383 and @xmath384 by @xmath385 , and will be ignored in the following .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath386 due to the neutral higgs exchange is given by @xmath387 where the loop function @xmath388 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "note that the @xmath389 operator is equivalent to @xmath390 after fierz transformation ( but without summing over all flavors , only with @xmath391 ) .    in a model with minimal flavor violation ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the phases of the susy contributions would match those of the sm and so no new source of cp violation would be generated .",
    "however , if we extend minimal flavor violation to allow arbitrary phases ( a definition used by other authors ) , we can allow our @xmath383 and @xmath384 operators to be complex and contribute to @xmath392 .",
    "therefore we will assume that the new operators have complex coefficients with @xmath393 phases .",
    "however the wilson coefficients @xmath383 and @xmath384 also generate @xmath72 , which has been and is being searched for actively at the tevatron . the upper limit on this decay from cdf  @xcite during the tevatron s run",
    "i is @xmath394 the relevant effective hamiltonian is @xmath395.\\ ] ] note that the wilson coefficients @xmath396 here are essentially the same as those that appear in the effective hamiltonian for @xmath9 , up to a small difference between the muon and the strange quark masses ( or their yukawa couplings ) .",
    "we find that the current upper limit ( [ eq : cdf ] ) puts rather a strong constraint on @xmath386 : @xmath397 since ( b_s ) | c_r , s |^2 + | c_r , p |^2 .",
    "[ eq : higgs ] we then find that @xmath42 can not be smaller than 0.71 for such small values of @xmath386 within the naive factorization approach .",
    "thus it appears impossible to explain the large deviation in @xmath42 with higgs - mediated @xmath9 alone .",
    "recently the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have re - examined this issue in models with non - minimal flavor violation . among other things ,",
    "they allow a large @xmath398 operator , though one would normally expect such an operator to be suppressed by @xmath192 with respect to the @xmath399 operator .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that one can explain the data on @xmath42 without violating the cdf bound on @xmath400 if one allows the original operator and its parity conjugate to both be large and roughly the same size .",
    "since our explanation for @xmath25 involves non - minimal flavor violation , we should in principle allow similar violation in the higgs operators . in the general case",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath400 depends on ( b_s)|c_r , s - c_l , s|^2 + |c_r , p - c_l , p|^2 [ eq : higgs2 ] rather than eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs ] ) above .",
    "it would then appear that our limit applies to this difference rather than the coefficients individually  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite make use of this to find a region of parameter space consistent with negative @xmath25 .    however , this is not the complete story .",
    "because the couplings and masses in the mssm higgs sector are highly constrained ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath401 ) , the scalar and pseudoscalar coefficients are tied to one another . in particular , one finds that @xmath402 where the approximate equality becomes exact for @xmath403 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgs2 ] ) can be rewritten as : ( b_s)|c_r , s - c_l , s|^2 + |c_r , s + c_l , s|^2 = 2(|c_r , s|^2 + |c_l , s|^2 ) .",
    "our argument from the cdf bound applies as before , and we see no way to use higgs mediation to generate @xmath342 , at least in this way .",
    "in this section , we want to provide some motivation for @xmath406 that we find phenomenologically is needed to generate @xmath42 .",
    "conversely , considerations such as those in this section show how one might use data to point toward classes of string  based theories . at this stage",
    ", we are not advocating any model of @xmath407 , but rather showing that @xmath408 of the needed size can be theoretically plausible .    before going to a specific construction",
    ", we write down the generic expression for the flavor parameters @xmath409 in a supergravity lagrangian ( which is the low energy effective field theory derived from a string theory model ) . under the assumption that either the yukawa coupling does not depend on the moduli fields , or it is a function of moduli times some constant proportional to the yukawa coupling itself ,",
    "we can write the trilinear couplings as  @xcite @xmath410 where @xmath411 and @xmath412 are @xmath413 diagonal matrices , and @xmath414 . we also neglect a term which is proportional to a constant times the yukawa matrix which will not affect the prediction of @xmath415 .",
    "the mass insertions @xmath416 are defined as the ratio between the off diagonal elements and the diagonal ones of the squark mass matrices in the superckm basis .",
    "the superckm basis is defined by rotating the quark superfields by @xmath417 and @xmath418 , where @xmath419 .",
    "then we obtain the expression for the relevant lr mass insertions in the general mssm as @xmath420 where @xmath421 are model dependent parameters of order the gravitino mass , @xmath422 .",
    "the most important feature of this expression is that the sizes of various terms are proportional to sm fermion masses @xmath423",

    "* @xmath425 .",

    "however , the dominant rge runnings of the trilinears are diagonal in the superckm basis .",
    "therefore , those relation also hold approximately at low energy scale .",
    "we now turn to a possible string theory motivated scenario where those features can arise . for definiteness , we focus on the models constructed from a intersecting d5-brane setup .",

    "there are six compact dimensions which are grouped into three complex pairs labeled by @xmath428 .",
    "d - branes are objects on which open strings can end .",
    "open string sectors in this type of scenario are classified by ( i ) which d - brane it ends on , and ( ii ) which complex dimension it moves in",
    ". we will have the following open string states  @xcite    * @xmath429 : open strings which end on the @xmath430 brane and move along the @xmath431th complex compact dimension . * @xmath432 : open strings which start from the @xmath430 brane and end on the @xmath433 brane .",
    "the string theory selection rules permit two type of large couplings ( provided they are gauge invariant ) : @xmath434 and @xmath435 , where @xmath436 .",
    "the next question is how to embed the mssm matter content into the this scenario .",
    "since we need some large mixing between the last two generations , one obvious choice is to embed them identically , _",
    "i.e. _ , assign them to the same open string sector . however , this type of construction has a problem because it also predicts @xmath437 which is not desirable .",
    "therefore , we have to embed the last two generations into different open string sectors and yet give them a large mixing .",
    "suppose we have the following embedding of the mssm matter content into open string sectors , adopting the notation that @xmath438 and @xmath439 are the @xmath440th generation left and right handed quarks , respectively .",

    "in particular , the trilinear couplings are @xmath444 where @xmath445 s are _ complex _ parameters satisfying @xmath446 ) .",
    "we have singled out the part which is the yukawa matrix multiplied by a diagonal matrix proportional to the identity since this term is diagonal in the super - ckm basis and does not contribute to flavor violating processes .",
    "we also have the following expressions for soft masses @xmath447    using eq .",
    "( [ deltalr ] ) , our ansatz for the yukawa textures and the definition of the mass insertion parameter , we then have the following estimate for the size of @xmath294 : @xmath448 clearly , this can be as large as of order @xmath449 .",
    "it can also have a quite nontrivial phase structure since @xmath450 and @xmath451 are in general complex parameters .",
    "notice however in this particular implementation , we will generically have @xmath452 since @xmath453 .",
    "we can also choose @xmath454 to be close to zero by setting @xmath455 .",
    "as remarked above , this model suggests @xmath456 , so @xmath457 suggests @xmath458 .",
    "such a large value is not in conflict with any data on @xmath8 or @xmath366 , which give essentially no constraint on @xmath459  @xcite .",
    "also @xmath458 can generate a flavor changing top decay @xmath460 only up to @xmath461 for @xmath462 and @xmath463 gev , which are still below the threshold for observability ( @xmath464 ) at future colliders such as lhc and nlc .",
    "another prediction of this model is @xmath465 , which could dominate @xmath466 through the chromomagnetic @xmath467 transition .",
    "let us also comment on the size of @xmath317 in our current embedding . from our formula for the trilinears , we see that @xmath468 is determined by @xmath469 . in our current embedding , we have @xmath470 since the last two generations of the right - handed ( s)quarks have the same embedding .",

    ". then we can have a sizable @xmath475 while @xmath294 is suppressed by the higher power of @xmath167 .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us comment on the mass mixings / insertions that would be generated by the rg running from the high energy scale to electroweak scale .",
    "if we assume a universal boundary condition for scalar masses at the reduced planck scale @xmath476 gev , and all @xmath477 are zero at the high energy scale , nonnegligible values are induced by renormalization group ( rg ) running .",
    "the approximate solutions to the rg equation for the left squark mass squared becomes @xmath478 and one can estimate @xmath479 .",
    "note that this parameter is real however , since @xmath480 and @xmath481 are real in the wolfenstein parameterization .",
    "also other mass insertions are further suppressed by additional factors of @xmath482 and @xmath483 , so that @xmath484 and @xmath485 .",
    "these are too small to explain a large shift of @xmath42 relative to @xmath43",
    ".    in some susy gut scenarios , the large mixing in the neutrino sector induces a large mixing in the right squark sector through the analogous rg running .",
    "the resulting mixing is about  @xcite @xmath486 therefore the @xmath3 mixing is generically larger than @xmath2 mixing in susy guts where the see - saw mechanism is generating the nonvanishing neutrino masses .",
    "still it can not affect @xmath42 by a large amount as discussed in the previous section , although the size of @xmath326 could be @xmath487 with a new complex phase so that @xmath73 mixing could be significantly shifted .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the susy flavor problem is resolved by the alignment mechanism using some spontaneously broken flavor symmetries , or decoupling ( the effective susy models ) , the resulting @xmath2 or @xmath3 mixings in the @xmath488 sector could be easily order of @xmath489 ( @xmath490 ) with either @xmath491 , @xmath492 or @xmath493  @xcite , whereas the mixing in the 13 sector is further suppressed by additional power(s ) of @xmath167 ( s ) in order to avoid large contributions to @xmath10 mixing .",
    "these parameters will carry cp violating phases in general and can contribute significantly to @xmath7 and @xmath302 .",
    "further , in the presence of an @xmath2 or @xmath3 insertion , there can be an induced @xmath5 or @xmath6 insertion when @xmath494 is large with respect to the scalar masses , due to the double mass insertions  @xcite : @xmath495 in case @xmath496 , one can achieve @xmath497 , if @xmath498tev .",
    "this could be natural if @xmath138 is large @xmath499 . for larger @xmath500 mixing ,",
    "even smaller @xmath494 would suffice to induce the needed @xmath501 mass insertions of a size @xmath502 .",
    "since the @xmath503 s in susy flavor models are generically complex , the induced @xmath504 could carry a new cp violating phase  @xcite , which can again explain a large negative @xmath42 .",
    "also , the @xmath3 insertion can have a phase inherited from the neutrino mixing matrix in a susy gut model , which would be transferred to the induced @xmath6 insertion  @xcite .",
    "therefore the induced @xmath6 insertion can explain the observed @xmath42 in susy gut models .",
    "on the other hand , the phase of @xmath505 for the case of minimal sugra is given by the ckm matrix elements , and it is real for the 2 - 3 mixing .",
    "therefore the induced @xmath504 in sugra - like models is incapable of explaining the negative @xmath42 .",
    "recent data has given us hope that there may be new physics lurking in rare @xmath31-decays , particularly @xmath0 . in this paper , we considered several potentially important susy contributions to this process in order to see if a significant deviation in its time - dependent cp asymmetry @xmath42 could arise from susy effects .",
    "in particular , we considered the susy gluino contributions in models with non - minimal flavor violation , and the higgs - mediated contributions in models with minimal flavor violation .",
    "while the latter has the advantage of only affected the @xmath91 transition , current bound on @xmath506 at fermilab constrain the relevant operators to be too small .",
    "models based on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 insertions in gluino interaction vertices also give contributions too small to alter @xmath42 very much , unless gluinos are very light ( close to the experimental bounds ) .",
    "however , in an @xmath2 or @xmath3 scenario one expects an impending observation of gluinos and squarks , and absence of @xmath73 oscillations at the tevatron , since @xmath7 increases dramatically in the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) case when @xmath507 .    on the other hand",
    ", gluino - mediated @xmath5 or @xmath6 contributions can generate sizable effects in @xmath42 as long as @xmath508  @xmath333 . as a by - product",
    ", we found that nonleptonic @xmath31 decays such as @xmath0 are beginning to constrain @xmath509 as strongly as @xmath8 .",
    "we also studied various correlations among @xmath42 , @xmath49 , the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath8 , @xmath510 , @xmath75 and @xmath270 . using the @xmath5 or @xmath6 insertions , it is easy to obtain a negative @xmath42 without conflict with any other observables .",
    "furthermore , there are definite correlations among @xmath42 , @xmath49 and @xmath207 , and our explanation for the negative @xmath42 can be easily tested by measuring these other correlated observables .",
    "in particular @xmath49 can be positive only for the @xmath6 insertion .",
    "for this case , the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath8 vanishes ( assuming no @xmath3 insertion is present ) , unlike the case of the @xmath5 or @xmath2 insertions . in a scenario with both @xmath6 and @xmath3 insertions , the resulting direct cp asymmetry in @xmath8",
    "could be as large as in the @xmath5 mixing case , and there could be a large , complex contributions to @xmath73 mixing , leading to significant effects in @xmath7 and @xmath511 .",
    "the effects of the ( pure ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 insertions on @xmath73 are rather small and it would be difficult to distinguish our model from the sm by the @xmath73 mixing , considering various theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "thus , we have found that three classes of supersymmetric models could not naturally explain a negative time dependent cp asymmetry @xmath42 in @xmath0 if the initial hints of such an asymmetry should persist when data improves : @xmath2 , @xmath3 insertions , and higgs - dominated decays .",
    "two other classes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 insertions , can explain the data and can be distinguished to some extent with more and better data .",

    "<S> the rare decay @xmath0 is a well - known probe of physics beyond the standard model because it arises only through loop effects yet has the same time - dependent cp asymmetry as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent data suggesting new physics in @xmath0 , we look to supersymmetry for possible explanations , including contributions mediated by gluino loops and by higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> chirality - preserving @xmath2 and @xmath3 gluino contributions are generically small , unless gluinos and squarks masses are close to the current lower bounds . </S>",
    "<S> higgs contributions are also too small to explain a large asymmetry if we impose the current upper limit on @xmath4 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , chirality - flipping @xmath5 and @xmath6 gluino contributions can provide sizable effects and while remaining consistent with related results in @xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and other processes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the @xmath5 and @xmath6 insertions can be distinguished using other observables , and we provide a string - based model and other estimates to show that the needed sizes of mass insertions are reasonable . </S>"
