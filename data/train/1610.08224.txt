    "critical interfacial phenomena have been studied extensively over the last decades , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "a well - known example is wetting , where the macroscopically thick phase , e.g. , the fluid , is formed between the substrate and the other phase , say , the gas . liquid and gas are separated by the interface .",
    "an interesting complication arises when one considers the possibility of more than two phases .",
    "a third phase may be formed at the interface between the two other phases .",
    "an experimental realization is the two - component fluid system in equilibrium with its vapor phase  @xcite .",
    "both of the above scenarios may be mimicked in statistical physics in a simplified fashion , by either the two - state ising model in wetting - with the state `` + 1 '' representing , say , the fluid , and `` -1 '' the gas - or for the case of a third phase via multi - state spin models , simply by fixing distinct boundary states at the opposite sides of the system . in this latter case",
    ", the formation of the third phase with an excess of the non - boundary states has been called as interfacial adsorption  @xcite .    throughout the years",
    ", various aspects of the interfacial adsorption have been investigated via monte carlo methods and density renormalization - group calculations on the basis of specific multi - state spin models , namely potts and blume - capel models  @xcite .",
    "additional scaling and analytic arguments have been presented  @xcite , though not all of them have been concretely confirmed numerically , due to the restricted system sizes studied and the apparent underlying scaling corrections ( in some cases also because of the uncertainties in the location of critical points ) .",
    "however , notable results in the field include the determination of critical exponents and scaling properties of the temperature and lattice - size dependencies , as well as the clarification of the fundamental role of the type of the bulk transition , with isotropic scaling holding at continuous and tricritical bulk transitions , and anisotropic scaling at bulk transitions of first - order type .",
    "more recently , the role of randomness on the interfacial properties has been studied  @xcite and was found to affect , especially , the position of the interface , the excess or interfacial adsorption , and the form of the histograms resulting from the different random realizations .",
    "still , predictions of the isotropic finite - size scaling description for the interfacial adsorption at continuous phase transitions were observed to hold , at least for the particular case of the dilute @xmath5-states potts model studied in ref .",
    "attention should be drawn to related previous work on interfacial phenomena in dilute ferromagnetic potts models , in particular , considering hierarchical lattices , i.e. applying the migdal - kadanoff real space renormalization to the square lattice  @xcite , or performing a preliminary monte carlo study for the square lattice model  @xcite .",
    "motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , in the present work we examine the effects of bond randomness on the scaling behavior of the interfacial adsorption of two - dimensional potts models for various values of the internal states within the regime @xmath6 . in parallel",
    ", we present complementary results for the corresponding pure models , covering the complete spectrum of continuous , weak , and strong first - order phase transitions , including the tricky @xmath3 case  @xcite . for the pure systems our results support the early scaling predictions for the size dependence of the interfacial adsorption . for the random systems , the interfacial adsorption at the disordered - induced continuous transitions also follows the standard isotropic scaling with exponents that can be traced back to the best - known estimates of the bulk critical exponent ratio @xmath7 , thus extending and reinforcing the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite that was restricted on the case @xmath8 . on the other hand , logarithmic corrections are found to be necessary for a proper scaling description of the interfacial adsorption at @xmath4 for both pure and random versions of the system .",
    "finally , the self - averaging properties of the interfacial adsorption are discussed in terms of properly defined signal - to - noise ratios .",

    "exact values of the critical exponents are only known in the clean case  @xcite .",
    "numerical analysis , in the dilute case suggest that the bulk critical exponents depend rather mildly on @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "then , the analysis of the interfacial adsorption in these models may be simplified by the fact , that isotropic finite - size scaling is expected to hold at continuous transitions  @xcite .",
    "static and dynamic bulk critical properties of the random potts models have been estimated , using a variety of , predominantly , numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy between the @xmath0 equivalent potts states may be lifted by appropriate boundary conditions . in order to study the interfacial adsorption ,",

    "[ fig_conf_random_q10 ] for an instance of the pure ( upper panel ) and random ( lower panel ) @xmath39 potts model , it is seen that at the interface between the 1- and and 2-rich domains an excess of the non - boundary states is generated compared to the case of the absence of an interface .",
    "as expected , in the dilute case , the position of the interface , as well as the extent of the intervening third phase of non - boundary states , may be strongly affected by the spatial distribution of the couplings .",
    "then , the interfacial adsorption , measuring the surplus of non - boundary states induced by the interface between the 1- and 2-rich regions is defined for lattices with @xmath40 non - boundary sites , with @xmath41 being the linear dimension of the lattice , by  @xcite @xmath42}-(\\delta_{\\sigma_{i},n})_{[1:1]}\\right],\\ ] ] summing over all non - boundary sites @xmath10 and all non - boundary states @xmath43 .",

    "obviously , @xmath35 may be geometrically interpreted as the effective width of the domain of non - boundary states between the 1- and 2-rich domains .",
    "in our simulations of the potts models we applied the metropolis and the cluster - flip wolff algorithm  @xcite . of course , cluster flips violating the boundary conditions are not allowed  @xcite . as usual ,",
    "small lattices may be simulated using the metropolis algorithm , while the wolff algorithm is more efficient and is preferred for larger , say @xmath44 , system sizes .",

    "the number of clusters used in our simulations varied from @xmath51 for the smaller systems sizes up to @xmath52 for the larger sizes considered .    in random systems ,",
    "the main source of errors stems from the fact that the simulation data may vary drastically among different random configurations . in this work ,",

    "noteworthy , bulk properties of the random - bond potts model for various values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 have been studied quite extensively before  @xcite and the obtained pool of results will prove to be extremely useful for the analysis in the following section .",
    "the histograms at the critical point show nearly gaussian shapes , but being weakly tailed , in accordance with previous observations and discussions in our previous work  @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the dilute potts models on hierarchical lattices .",
    "the standard errors resulting from an ensemble average over bond realizations decrease with the number of configurations , @xmath53 , as @xmath54 .",

    "finally , for the application of finite - size scaling on the numerical data in terms of characteristic power - law fittings as will be discussed below , we employed the standard criterion of the @xmath57 , where dof denotes the number of degrees of freedom .",

    "a more refined ansatz invokes corrections to the asymptotic scaling behavior , as will be discussed below .",
    "note however that in the present work , we are not interested in the temperature dependence of @xmath35 , but rather only on its size dependence . from the above scaling assumption  ( [ eq : scal ] ) we derive that the leading critical behavior of the interfacial adsorption is given by @xmath65  @xcite .    at the critical ( and tricritical ) points ,",
    "the singularities in the interfacial adsorption are induced by bulk critical fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
