    "@xmath0 violation in the standard model ( sm ) arises from an irreducible complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite . of recent interest",
    "is @xmath0 violation in @xmath8 transitions which proceeds by loop diagrams that may be affected by new particles in various extensions of the sm .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath8 transitions are predicted in the sm to be slightly higher than those observed in @xmath9 transitions .",
    "however , current experimental measurements  @xcite tend to be lower than those for @xmath9 transitions motivating more precise experimental determinations .",
    "the decay of the @xmath6  produces a @xmath5  pair of which one ( @xmath10 ) may be fully reconstructed while the other ( @xmath11 ) may reveal its flavour .",
    "the proper time interval between @xmath10  and @xmath11  is defined as @xmath12 and from coherent @xmath5  production in the @xmath6  decay , the time - dependent decay rate for a quasi - two - body mode when @xmath11  possesses flavour @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : @xmath15 , @xmath16 : @xmath17 ) , is given by  @xcite @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19  is the @xmath14  lifetime and @xmath20   is the @xmath21  mass difference .",
    "this assumes no @xmath0 violation in mixing , @xmath22 , and that the @xmath21  lifetime difference is negligible .",
    "the parameter , @xmath23 , denotes the direct @xmath0 violating component and @xmath24  represents mixing - induced @xmath0 violation . for time - dependent dalitz plot analyses ,",
    "the time - dependent decay rate is written as @xmath25.\\ ] ] the dalitz - dependent amplitudes , @xmath26 , can be written in the isobar approximation as a superposition of intermediate decay channels , @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 for @xmath26 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 are complex coefficients describing the relative magnitudes and phases between the decay channels .",
    "the form factors , @xmath32 , depend on the dalitz plot coordinates , @xmath33 , and describe the invariant mass and angular distribution probabilities . for a @xmath0 eigenstate , @xmath27 ,",
    "the time - dependent @xmath0 violation parameters can be calculated as @xmath34 and @xmath35 is directly accessible as a fit parameter .",
    "consequently , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are restricted to reside in the physical region .",
    "the relative fraction of each component can be calculated with , @xmath38",
    "these measurements of @xmath0 violating parameters are based on @xmath39 pairs collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath40 ( @xmath41 on @xmath42 ) collider  @xcite .",
    "operating with a peak luminosity that exceeds @xmath43 , the collider produces the @xmath6  resonance ( @xmath44  gev ) with a lorentz boost of @xmath45 , opposite to the positron beam direction , @xmath46 , which usually decays into a @xmath5  pair .",
    "reconstructed @xmath47 candidates are described with two kinematic variables : the beam - constrained mass , @xmath48 and the energy difference , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the beam energy and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the energy ( momentum ) of the @xmath47 meson all evaluated in the centre - of - mass system ( cms ) .",
    "the dominant background in the reconstruction of @xmath10  is from continuum ( @xmath53 ) events .",
    "since their topology tends to be jet - like in contrast to the spherical @xmath5  decay , continuum can be suppressed with a fisher discriminant based on modified fox - wolfram moments  @xcite .",
    "this discriminant is combined with the polar angle of the @xmath47 candidate in the cms to form a likelihood ratio , @xmath54 , which separates continuum from @xmath5  events .    since the @xmath55 and @xmath56 mesons",
    "are approximately at rest in the @xmath6  enter - of - mass system ( cms ) , the difference in decay time between the @xmath5 pair , @xmath57 , can be determined from the displacement in @xmath46 between the final state decay vertices , @xmath58 . to obtain the @xmath57  distribution ,",
    "we reconstruct the tag - side vertex from the tracks not used to reconstruct @xmath10  @xcite and employ the flavour tagging routine described in ref .",
    "the tagging information is represented by two parameters , the @xmath11  flavour , @xmath13 and @xmath59 .",
    "the parameter , @xmath59 , is an event - by - event , mc determined flavour - tagging dilution factor that ranges from @xmath60 for no flavour discrimination to @xmath61 for unambiguous flavour assignment .",
    "direct @xmath0 violation has been observed in @xmath62  @xcite and is found to be significantly different from that in @xmath63 . this unexpected result may indicate the presence of new physics ( np ) or poor understanding of strong interaction effects in @xmath47 decays .",
    "a model - independent test for np is possible via an isospin sum rule with high statistics  @xcite which gives a relation among the direct @xmath0 violation asymmetries measured in all possible @xmath64 modes , i.e. @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 here , @xmath70 represents the branching ratio of each decay mode and @xmath71 is the lifetime of the charged @xmath47 meson . the sum rule s theoretical precision",
    "is determined by su(2 ) flavour symmetry , i.e. a few % , therefore the sum rule provides a clean test for new physics . as a fundamental input ,",
    "the @xmath0 violation measurement in @xmath65 is currently the least known , experimentally . since",
    "the branching fractions and @xmath0 asymmetries of other @xmath64 decay modes have been measured to good precision  @xcite , @xmath72 is predicted with a small error .",
    "in addition to the @xmath73 mode , we measure @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath74 decay for the first time , in order to maximize sensitivity to the direct @xmath0 violation parameter , @xmath72 .",
    "the signal yield of @xmath75  events is found from a three - dimensional extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit to @xmath76 , @xmath77  and @xmath54  to be @xmath78 events . for @xmath79 , @xmath76",
    "can be calculated from the direction of the @xmath80  cluster while @xmath77  can not be calculated .",
    "the signal yield of @xmath81 events is extracted from a two - dimensional fit to @xmath76  and @xmath54  and has a significance of 3.7@xmath82 including systematic uncertainties .    as the vertex position of @xmath79  can not be determined and the vertex reconstruction efficiency of @xmath75  is @xmath83 due to the long lifetime of the @xmath84 , these events can still be used to calculate @xmath23  by integrating eq .",

    "[ fig_kspi0 ] .",
    "we find that the mixing induced component is consistent with charmonium , @xmath86  @xcite , and that there is a @xmath87 deviation between our measurement of @xmath23  and the expectation from the isospin sum rule , @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the signal yield of @xmath2  events is found from a one - dimensional fit to @xmath77  to be @xmath89 events and the resonances considered in the signal model ( eq . [ eq_sigmod ] ) are the @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95  and a non - resonant component .",
    "we obtain the @xmath0 parameters ,    solution 1 : = @xmath96 + @xmath97    @xmath98    solution 2 : = @xmath99 + @xmath100    @xmath101    where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is the dalitz plot signal model uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig_kspipi ] shows the fit results .",
    "the high @xmath102 fraction of solution 1 is in agreement with some phenomenological estimates  @xcite and may also be favoured by the total @xmath103 @xmath104-wave phase shift when compared with that measured by lass  @xcite .",
    "as the likelihood difference is not found to be significant , we do not rule between these solutions where @xmath23  is consistent with null asymmetry and @xmath105  agrees with charmonium .",
