    "since the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation @xcite , interest was also oriented toward the study of ultracold fermions and mixtures of bosons and fermions .",
    "the theoretical study of the density profiles of trapped boson - fermion mixtures was done , however , mainly numerically , only carried out for certain parameter ranges , and stability considerations lacked completeness . in this paper",
    "we provide a comprehensive classification of all continuous ground - state profiles of a spin - polarized boson - fermion mixture , we will derive analytic conditions for each scenario , and rigorously show stability .      originally ,",
    "interest in ultracold fermions was , among other reasons , spurred by the possible observation of the famous transition to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer state .",
    "quantum degeneracy for fermionic systems , however , was hard to achieve as the pauli exclusion principle forbids @xmath0-wave scattering in a spin - polarized sample and @xmath1-wave interaction is strongly suppressed at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , a fermionic gas can not be cooled evaporatively in a magnetic trap .",
    "this problem was circumvented by preparing the system in two spin states @xcite or by employing boson - fermion mixtures , where the bose - einstein condensate is cooled evaporatively and then used as a sympathetic coolant for the fermionic species @xcite .",
    "when boson - fermion mixtures with attractive interaction between the components were studied @xcite , a collapse of the system was observed @xcite whenever the number of fermions exceeded a certain threshold as predicted by ref .",
    "a feshbach resonance enabled @xcite to tune the boson - fermion interaction from the collapse at attractive values via regimes where the densities interpenetrate to strong repulsion , where the system tends to demix . while the onset of superfluidity in a pure fermi mixture of two spin states was proved in 2005 by the observation of quantized vortices @xcite , it was not until 2014 that the simultaneous superfluidity of a boson - fermion mixture was observed at unitarity @xcite .",
    "+ a lot of effort has also been devoted to boson - fermion mixtures on the theoretical side to analyze the phase diagram . describing the bosons by the gross - pitaevskii equation and the fermions within the local - density approximation ,",
    "the collapse in attractive mixtures was studied numerically @xcite , semi - analytically by a variational gauss ansatz @xcite , or in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . scaling laws to determine the boundaries in parameter space between collapse , mixing , and phase separation were obtained as functions of the chemical potential .",
    "their dependence on the particle numbers , however , could only be established numerically or by rough estimates .",
    "+ repulsive interaction leads to a large variety of stable density configurations in the mixed regime , some of which were found numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", many interesting cases in the phase - separated region , e.g.  mirror - symmetry breaking or the ` boson burger ' in an anisotropic trap were investigated in ref .",
    "the discussion was complemented by further ` exotic ' configurations found at higher energies @xcite .",
    "a thorough stability consideration was made for the homogeneous case @xcite but has not been generalized to trapped systems yet .",
    "finally , the influence of finite temperature @xcite and beyond mean - field effects @xcite have also been investigated .      in this paper",
    "we consider a mixture of a bose - einstein condensate with fermions , which are either spin polarized or at unitarity .",
    "we provide a comprehensive classification of possible ground states in the regime where the densities are continuous . configurations with discontinuities , for example when phase separation occurs , will only be discussed briefly . in our classification of density shapes we group the large variety of different configurations with respect to characteristic features , e.g.  the number of maxima in the densities or which species encloses the other , similarly to what has been done for a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates in @xcite and @xcite",

    "the discussion will be supplemented with a thorough stability consideration .",

    "+ finally , let us comment upon the reliability of our model . while the local - density approximation precisely describes the fermionic density even for a small number of particles , the thomas - fermi approximation is only expected to provide accurate results when the bosonic density behaves smoothly and the particle number is not too small . in the vicinity of sharp edges , which e.g.  occur in the case of phase separation or at the surface of the cloud",
    ", the density will be smoothed out as predicted by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , but the thomas - fermi approximation is still expected to provide qualitatively correct results .",
