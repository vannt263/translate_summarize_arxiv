    "the goal of this article is to give a complete answer in the negatively curved case .",
    "strictly speaking , the unit tangent bundle to an orientable riemanian surface is a 3-dimensional homology sphere if and only if the surface is a 2-sphere .",
    "but geodesic flows are naturally defined on a larger class , namely on 2-dimensional orbifolds , that is , surfaces locally modeled on a riemannian disc or on the quotient of a disc by a finite rotation group  the so - called _ conic points _ of the 2-orbifold ( we restrict our attention here to orientable 2-orbifolds ) . in this larger class",
    "the unit tangent bundle is always a 3-manifold and it is a rational homology sphere if and only if the 2-orbifold is a 2-sphere with a finite number , say  @xmath3 , of conic points  what we now call a _ n - conic 2-sphere _ ( see lemma  [ l : qhs ] below ) .",
    "a @xmath3-conic 2-sphere admits a negatively curved metric if and only if @xmath4 ( in the case @xmath5 the orders of the conic points have to satisfy the additional constraint  @xmath6 and in the case @xmath7 the quadruple @xmath8 is prohibited ) . since the geodesic flows associated to different negatively curved metrics are all topologically conjugated  @xcite , one can speak of _ the _ geodesic flow on a hyperbolic @xmath3-conic 2-sphere .",
    "our main result is    [ t : main ] let @xmath9 be a hyperbolic @xmath3-conic 2-sphere .",
    "then for @xmath5 the geodesic flow on  @xmath10 is left - handed and for @xmath11 the geodesic flow is not left - handed ( nor right - handed ) .    from the point - of - view of left - handedness , theorem  [ t : main ] contains good and bad news .",

    ", left - handedness implies that every finite collection of periodic orbits that bounds a surface also bounds a birkhoff section for the flow  @xcite .",
    "such a surface is then the page of an open book decomposition .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] has two independent part .",
    "the first part consists in proving that the geodesic flow on a hyperbolic @xmath3-conic 2-sphere with @xmath11 is not left - handed . for this",
    "it is enough to find pairs of periodic orbits with linking number of arbitrary sign , and we do it using an elementary construction .",
    "the second part is more difficult and consists in proving that any two periodic orbits the geodesic flow on a 3-conic 2-sphere has negative linking number .",
