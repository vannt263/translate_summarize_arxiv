    "over a 7manifold , a topological reduction to a principal @xmath0bundle is achieved by the existence of a certain 3form . the fact that this 3form is generic or",
    "( following the language of hitchin ) enables one to set up a variational principle over a fixed cohomology class whose critical points are precisely the manifolds of holonomy @xmath0  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with a new type of riemannian geometry over 7manifolds which generalises this notion .",
    "topologically speaking , it is defined by an even or odd form which we think of as a _ spinor _ for the orthogonal bundle @xmath2 with its natural inner product of split signature .",
    "this construction is perfectly general and works in all dimensions , but there are special cases where @xmath3 acts with an _ open _ orbit in its spin representations @xmath4 .",
    "an example in dimension 6 are the so  called generalised calabi ",
    "yau manifolds associated with an @xmath5invariant spinor  @xcite . in dimension 7 , there are stable spinors whose stabiliser is either conjugate to @xmath6 or @xmath7 . in this paper , we shall deal with the latter case and define a generalised @xmath0structure as a ( topological ) reduction from @xmath8 to @xmath7 .",
    "stability allows us to consider a generalised variational problem which provides us with various integrability conditions .",
    "we begin by introducing the algebraic setup .",
    "a reduction to @xmath7 gives rise to various objects .",
    "firstly , it induces a metric on @xmath1 , and moreover , a 2form @xmath9 which we refer to as the _ @xmath10field_. as an element of the lie algebra @xmath11 inside @xmath12 , it acts on any @xmath13representation by exponentiation .",
    "secondly , we obtain two unit spinors @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the irreducible spin representation of @xmath16 . tensoring the spinors",
    "yields an even or odd form @xmath17^{ev , od}$ ] by projection on @xmath18 .",
    "the first important result we prove states that any @xmath7invariant spinor @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20^{ev , od}.\\ ] ] in physicists terminology , the scalar @xmath21 represents the _ dilaton _  here it appears as a scaling factor .    moving on to global issues",
    ", we see that up to a @xmath10field transformation , a generalised @xmath0structure is essentially a pair of principle @xmath0fibre bundles inside the orthonormal frame bundle determined by the metric .",
    "in particular , any topological @xmath0manifold trivially induces a generalised @xmath0manifold , and consequently , any spinnable seven ",
    "fold carries such a structure . over a compact manifold",
    ", we can classify generalised @xmath0structures up to vertical homotopy by an integer which effectively counts ( with an appropriate sign convention ) the number of points where the two @xmath0structures inside the @xmath16principal bundle coincide .    over a closed manifold",
    ", we can then set up a variational problem along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "in close analogy to the classical case , the condition for a critical point is that both the even and the odd @xmath7invariant spinor , now regarded as a form , have to be closed .",
    "we shall adopt this as the condition of _ strong _ integrability for any ( not necessarily compact ) generalised @xmath0structure . interpreting this integrability condition in terms of the right  hand side of  ( [ genformrep ] ) leads to our main result .",
    "theorem  [ integrability ] characterises strongly integrable generalised @xmath0structures in terms of two linear metric connections @xmath22 with skew  symmetric , closed torsion @xmath23 such that @xmath24 holds .",
    "connections with skew  symmetric torsion have gained a lot of attention in the recent mathematical literature ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) due to their importance in string theory . eventually , our reformulation yields the supersymmetry equations arising in type ii supergravity with bosonic background fields  @xcite .",
    "the spinorial picture is also useful for deriving geometrical properties . in particular",
    ", we compute the ricci tensor which is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the hessian of the dilaton .",
    "a further striking consequence is a no  go theorem for compact manifolds ( generalising similar statements in  @xcite and  @xcite ) : here , the torsion of any strongly integrable generalised @xmath0structure must vanish , that is , the underlying spinors @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parallel with respect to the levi  civita connection . in this sense , only ",
    "classical \" solutions can be found for the variational problem .",
    "however , local examples with non  vanishing torsion exist in abundance .",
    "using again the form definition of a generalised @xmath7structure , we will describe a systematic construction method known in string theory as @xmath1duality .",
    "it consists of changing the topology by replacing a fibre isomorphic to @xmath27 ( or more generally to an @xmath28torus ) without destroying integrability .",
    "this allows us to pass from a trivial generalised structure coming from a classical @xmath27invariant @xmath0structure with vanishing torsion ( for which we can easily find examples ) to a trivial @xmath27bundle with a non  trivial generalised @xmath0structure .",
    "the lack of interesting compact examples motivated us to consider a _ constrained _ variational problem following ideas in  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to _ weakly _ integrable structures of either _ even _ or _ odd _ type .",
    "for these the no  go theorem does not apply , but the construction of examples , let alone compact ones , remains an open problem .",
    "although arising out of a similar constraint as manifolds of weak holonomy @xmath0 , this notion gives rise to a new geometry without a classical counterpart which renders a straightforward application of @xmath1duality impossible .",
    "we investigate its properties along with those of the strongly integrable case .",
    "the algebraic theory outlined above not only makes sense for @xmath29structures , but also for @xmath30 inside @xmath31 , leading to the notion of a _ generalised @xmath16manifold_. it is also defined by an invariant form of mixed degree , which , however , is not stable . comparison with classical @xmath16geometry suggests closeness of this form as a natural notion of integrability .",
    "section  [ spin7theory ] briefly explores the theory of these structures which is developed in full detail in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is based on a part of the author s doctoral thesis  @xcite .",
    "he wishes to acknowledge the daad , the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes , the epsrc and the university of oxford for various financial support .",
    "the author also wants to thank gil cavalcanti , michael crabb , claus jeschek , wilson sutherland and the examiners dominic joyce and simon salamon for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "finally , he wishes to express his special gratitude to his supervisor nigel hitchin .",
    "we consider the vector bundle @xmath32 , where @xmath1 is a real , @xmath28dimensional vector space .",
    "it carries a natural orientation and the inner product of signature @xmath33 , defined for @xmath34 and @xmath35 by @xmath36 singles out a group conjugate to @xmath37 inside @xmath38 .",

    "the exterior algebra @xmath47 becomes thus the pinor representation space of @xmath48 and splits into the irreducible spin representation spaces @xmath49 of @xmath50 .",

    "such that the spinor bundle is isomorphic , as a @xmath40space , to the exterior form bundle , albeit in a non  canonical way ( see , for instance , the discussion in section 2.8 in  @xcite ) . we will neglect these subtleties for we will consider orientable manifolds only , and therefore omit the twist to ease notation .",
