    "fluctuation relations ( frs ) provide general results about the full work ( or entropy production ) distributions in non - equilibrium systems . however , in many cases the full work is not measurable and only partial work measurements are possible .",
    "the latter do not fulfill a fr and can not be used to extract free energy differences from irreversible work measurements .",
    "we propose a new application of frs to infer the full work distribution from partial work measurements .",
    "we prove this new type of inference using dual - trap optical tweezers where two forces ( one per trap ) are measured , allowing us to derive full and partial work distributions .",
    "we derive a set of results of direct interest to single molecule scientists and , more in general , to physicists and biophysicists .",
    "fluctuation relations ( frs ) are mathematical equations connecting non equilibrium work measurements to equilibium free energy differences .",
    "frs , such as the jarzynski equality ( je ) or the crooks fluctuation relation ( cfr ) have become a valuable tool in single - molecule biophysics where they are used to measure folding free energies from irreversible pulling experiments @xcite .",
    "such measurements have been carried out with laser optical tweezers on different nucleic acid structures such as hairpins @xcite , g - quadruplexes @xcite and proteins @xcite , and with atomic force microscopes on proteins @xcite and",
    "bi - molecular complexes @xcite . an important issue regarding frs is the correct definition of work , which rests on the correct identification of configurational variables and control parameters . in the single - trap optical tweezers configuration",
    "this issue has been thoroughly discussed @xcite .",
    "+ the situation about how to correctly measure work in small systems becomes subtle when there are different forces applied to the system . in this case theory",
    "gives the prescription to correctly define the work ( @xmath0 ) for a given trajectory ( @xmath1 ) : integrate the generalized force ( @xmath2 ) ( conjugated to the control parameter , @xmath3 ) over @xmath3 along @xmath1 , @xmath4 .",
    "however , in some cases one can not measure the proper generalized force or has limited experimental access to partial sources of the entropy production leading to what we call incorrect or partial work measurements .",
    "a remarkable example of this situation are dual - trap setups , mostly used as the high - resolution tool for single molecule studies ( fig .",
    "[ figure : opts]a ) . in this case",
    "a dumbbell formed by a molecule tethered between two optically trapped beads is manipulated by moving one trap relative to the other . in this setup two different forces ( one per trap )",
    "can be measured and at least two different work definitions are possible . in equilibrium conditions ,",
    "i.e. when the traps are not moved both forces are equivalent : the forces acting on each bead have equal magnitude and opposite sign . on the contrary , in pulling experiments , where one trap is at rest ( with respect to water ) while the other is moved ,",
    "the two forces become inequivalent .",
    "this is so because the center of mass of the dumbbell drifts and the beads are affected by different viscous drags ( purple arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure : opts]b ) . in such conditions",
    "theory prescribes that the full thermodynamic work must be defined on the force measured at the moving trap whereas the force measured in the trap at rest ( with respect to water ) leads to a _ partial work measurement _ which , as we show below , entails a systematic error in free energy estimates .",
    "the difference between both works equals the dissipation by the center of mass of the dumbbell , which is only correctly accounted for in the correct work definition .",
    "+ in this paper we combine theory and experiments in a dual - trap setup to demonstrate several results .",
    "first , we show that if the wrong work definition is used , free energy estimates will be flawed .",
    "the error is especially severe in the case of unidirectional work estimates ( e.g. je ) while it influences bi - directional estimates to a lesser extent .",
    "this fact is not purely academical : measuring the force in the trap at rest is experimentally easier in dual - trap setups and , in fact , many groups choose to do so @xcite .",
    "for example if different lasers are used for trapping and detection , measuring the force in the moving trap poses the additional challenge of keeping the trapping and detection lasers aligned while moving them .",
    "second , we show how it is possible , by using the cfr , to _ infer _ the the full work distribution from partial work measurements .",
    "we demonstrate this new type of inference in our dual - trap setup by showing how to reconstruct the correct work distribution ( i.e the one we would have measured in the moving optical trap ) from partial work measurements in the wrong optical trap ( i.e. the one at rest with respect to water ) by using the cfr . in particular , for symmetric setups the correct work distribution can be directly inferred by simply shifting the partial work distribution . in asymmetric setups inference",
    "is still possible in the framework of a gaussian approximation , but the knowledge of some equilibrium properties of the system is still required .",
    "this type of inference should be seen an example of a more general application of frs which aims at extracting information about the total entropy production of a nonequilibrium system from partial entropy production measurements .",
    "this allows us to determine the average power dissipated by the center of mass of the dumbbell , from which we can extract the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficient thereby avoiding direct hydrodynamic measurements .",
    "moreover , we argue this type of inference might find applicability to future biophysical experiments where the sources of entropy production are not directly measurable , e.g. atp - dependent motor translocation where the hydrolysis reaction cycle can not be followed one atp at a time .",
    "finally we show how , in symmetric setups , the work definition satisfying the cfr is not unique .",
    "in particular the _ differential work _ , based on differential force measurements @xcite , still satisfies the cfr and leads to the least biased free energy estimates .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this work definition is that it completely filters out the dissipation due to the motion of the center of mass of the dumbbell . throughout the paper , and for simplicity and pedagogical reasons , most of the derivations , calculations and experiments are shown for symmetric dual - trap setups whereas the asymmetric case is discussed towards the end of the paper .",
    "in dual - trap setups a molecule is stretched by two optical traps , the control parameter @xmath3 being the trap - to - trap distance .",
    "let a , b denote the two optical traps .",
    "when one trap ( say trap a ) is moved with respect to the bath while trap b is at rest , suitable configurational variables are the positions of the beads , both measured from the center of the trap at rest ( trap b ) .",
    "we shall denote these variables by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , fig .",
    "[ figure : opts]b .",
    "the total energy of the system is composed of three terms : @xmath7 where the quadratic terms model the potential of the optical trap and @xmath8 describes the properties of the tether .",
    "however one could measure the positions of the beads and the trap - to - trap distance in the moving frame of trap a ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ figure : opts]b ) , and the potential energy in eq . would be written as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are negative ) .",
    "central to our analysis will be the equation connecting the potential @xmath14 and the work performed on the system by changing the control parameter @xcite : @xmath15 from eq .",
    "we get : @xmath16 with @xmath17 . inserting @xmath18 instead of @xmath14 in gives : @xmath19 despite of their similarity we will show that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are remarkably different .",
    "in fact , from the reference frame of trap a , the bath is seen to flow with velocity @xmath22 ( fig . [",
    "figure : opts]b ) . because of this flow an experiment in which trap a is moved is not galilean equivalent to one in which trap b is moved . in the presence of a flow the connection between potential and work , eq . , is not valid anymore .",
    "in fact thermodynamic work measurements must be based on the force measured in the trap being moved .",
    "this fact has been discussed in @xcite , yet the implications to single - molecule experiments have never been pointed out . summarizing , if trap a is moved and b is at rest with respect to water , using the work @xmath20 ( eq . ) in the je leads to correct free energy estimates whereas using @xmath21 ( eq . ) in the je leads to a systematic error .",
    "below we quantify such error in detail .",
    "the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be readily discussed in symmetric setups ( @xmath23 ) where calculations are much simpler . to do this",
    "we switch to a new coordinate system : @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the position of the geometric center of the dumbbell , while @xmath26 is the differential coordinate @xcite . in this coordinate system the potential eq .",
    "reads @xmath27 : @xmath28 the potential energy term @xmath29 associated to @xmath25 is that of a moving trap , a problem that has been addressed both with experiments and theory @xcite , while the potential energy term @xmath30 associated to @xmath26 corresponds to pulling experiments performed using a single trap and a fixed point .",
    "the dumbbell is in contact with an isothermal bath where the equilibrium state is described by the boltzmann distribution and the corresponding partition function ( we assume a weak system - environment coupling , a situation satisfied in our experimental conditions , section s2 in the si ) .",
    "consequently , the two degrees of freedom are uncoupled and the total partition function for the system factorizes : @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the temperature and @xmath34 being boltzmann constant . as a consequence free energy changes in the system can be decomposed into two contributions : @xmath35 work can also be decomposed into two contributions , each regarding one of the subsystems : @xmath36 here @xmath37 contains the work done in stretching the molecule while @xmath38 is pure dissipation due to the movement of the center of mass of the dumbbell .",
    "note that : @xmath39 which shows that the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is entirely due to @xmath38 .",
    "the je holds for @xmath20 , the standard work definition , so that @xmath40 inserting eqs . ,",
    "in we get : @xmath41 .",
    "in symmetric setups @xmath38 and @xmath37 are independently distributed random variables ( see sections s1 and s3 in the si ) and we can conclude that : @xmath42 using the je on both @xmath20 and @xmath21 we get two different free energy estimates : @xmath43 ( eq . ) and @xmath44 . the error @xmath45 committed by using @xmath21 instead of @xmath20 can be quantified as : @xmath46 from eqs . , and again using the fact @xmath38 and @xmath37",
    "are independently distributed random variables we get @xmath47 and similarly for @xmath21 . as a consequence @xmath48 and eq .",
    "is reduced to @xmath49 since @xmath25 is subject to a quadratic potential ( eq . ) , we expect @xmath38 to be a gaussian random variable .",
    "this is not true in general for @xmath37 given that @xmath26 feels the nonlinear term @xmath8 . for gaussian random variables we have : @xmath50 where by @xmath51 we denote the variance of @xmath38 . moreover dragging a trapped bead in a fluid causes no free energy change ,",
    "so that : @xmath52 or @xmath53 . inserting eqs . and in eq .",
    "we get : @xmath54 equation gives @xmath55 showing that @xmath56 is lower than @xmath43 ( eq . ) .",
    "interestingly enough , using @xmath21 instead of @xmath20 in the je leads to free energy estimates in apparent violation of the second law .",
    "the error on free energy estimates obtained using @xmath21 instead of @xmath20 is proportional to the mean work performed on the center of the dumbbell .",
    "this mean work @xmath57 is just the mean friction force times the total trap displacement @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the friction coefficient of the drag force opposing the movement of the geometric center of the dumbbell .",
    "the value of @xmath60 can be independently obtained from equilibrium measurements @xcite ( sections s4,s5 in the si ) .",
    "equations and show that free energy estimates based on the standard work @xmath20 and the differential work @xmath37 are equivalent : @xmath61 we stress that this is only true for symmetric setups where @xmath38 and @xmath37 are independent random variables .",
    "the case of asymmetric setups is discussed further below . therefore @xmath37 can be used for free energy determination , as it has been done in @xcite , although without discussion .",
    "equation does only hold when the number of work measurements , @xmath62 , tends to infinity . in all practical cases we deal with finite @xmath62 and",
    "the jarzynski estimator is biased @xcite .",
    "the bias is strongly linked to the typical dissipation @xmath63 and a reliable estimate of free energy differences requires a number of work measurements which scales as @xmath64 @xcite , so that even a small reduction in @xmath63 entails a considerable improvement in the convergence of free energy estimators .",
    "moreover the bias is superadditive .",
    "let us consider for simplicity gaussian work distributions . in this case",
    "the bias , @xmath65 , in the large @xmath62 limit is a function of the variance of the distribution @xmath66 and of @xmath62 @xcite : @xmath67 @xmath65 is a convex function of @xmath68 , and is superadditive i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "this means that , should the work be the sum of two independent gaussian contributions , the bias on the sum is greater than the sum of the biases .",
    "although eq .",
    "was derived under strong assumptions , superadditivity does also hold for other theoretical expressions for the bias and has been checked in our experimental data ( see below ) .",
    "let us introduce the following jarzynski estimators for finite @xmath62 : @xmath70 and the corresponding bias functions : @xmath71 since @xmath72 , superadditivity guarantees : @xmath73 because of eq .",
    "differential work measurements always improve the convergence of free energy estimates in dual - trap setups .",
    "this is especially important in all those cases in which bidirectional methods ( e.g. the cfr ) can not be used and one has to employ unidirectional methods .",
    "the theory discussed so far has been put to test in a series of pulling experiments performed in a recently developed dual - trap optical tweezers setup which directly measures force in each trap @xcite .",

    "this is why , for irreversible transformations between equilibrium states , we have a fr for the dissipated work ( which is the total entropy production ) but not for the dissipated heat ( which is just the entropy production in the environment ) .",
    "the main tenet is now that the violation of frs in a given setting provides useful information : it is an evidence that some contribution to the total entropy production is being missed .",
    "we have given rigorous examples in which the violation of frs can be used to characterize the missing entropy production .",
    "remarkably , in our model system , one could even replace the moving trap by a moving micropipette , an object lacking any measurement capability , and still infer the work distribution exerted by that object on the molecular system ( this extremely asymmetric setup would still be described by eq.([eqaf ] ) , with @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .",
    "these results open the exciting prospect of extending and applying these ideas to steady state systems , such as molecular motors , to extract useful information about their mechanochemical cycle .",
    "in order to give it a clear and definite meaning to free energy inference we have discussed irreversible transformations between equilibrium states performed with dual - trap optical tweezers . in these experiments a molecular tether",
    "is attached between two beads which are manipulated with two optical traps .",
    "the irreversible transformation is performed by increasing the trap - to - trap distance at a finite speed . in this kind of transformations",
    "the dissipated work equals the total entropy production leading to our first result : in pulling experiments work @xmath20 must be defined on the force measured in the trap which is moved with respect to the thermal bath .",

    "we have called @xmath21 a partial work measurement because it misses part of the total dissipation .",
    "this result is of direct interest to experimentalists : many optical tweezers setups are designed so that they can only measure @xmath21 .",

    "here we discussed free energy inference in the framework of a gaussian approximation , the extent to which such inference is generally possible should be the subject of future studies .",
    "let us summarize our main results :    * a symmetry of the system can be crucial for the inference . for left - right symmetric systems ( as exemplified in our symmetric dual - trap setup )",
    "the @xmath110 can be inferred from @xmath104 just by imposing that the former satisfies the cfr .",
