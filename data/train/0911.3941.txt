    "the importance of a reliable statistical definition of rain event resides in the possibility of creating viable models for a great variety of hydrological applications : e.g. catchment run - off , soil erosion and canopy losses @xcite .",
    "ecohydrologic studies rely on rain event modelling to study the influence of the precipitation pulse dynamics on the vegetation architecture , plant species interactions , and the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in arid and semi - arid ecosystems @xcite . in spite of the widespread adoption of the rain event concept ,",
    "a proper non arbitrary statistical definition of rain event is still an open issue .",
    "the word `` event '' has been used to indicate different things in different contexts , and a great variety of techniques have been used for its definition . the most common criterion to define a rain event is the minimum intra event time ( mit ) : the mit value separating two events ranges from 15 min to 24 hours @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the choice of a particular mit is not related to observed dynamical properties of the rainfall phenomenon but to a particular time scale of the hydrological process considered : e.g. lloyd et al .",
    "@xcite use 3 h as mit because it is the estimated time for the canopy to dry , bracken et al .",
    "@xcite use mit=12 h so that the ground could dry between rain off events , while aryal et al .",
    "@xcite use 8 h as mit because it is the estimated time for highway surface depression to dry .",
    "recently , an alternative definition of rain event @xcite has gained some recognition in hydrological literature @xcite . according to this new proposal a rain event",
    "is identified by the occurrences of consecutive adjacent wet time intervals ( the time intervals being equal in duration to the instrument time resolution ) .",
    "we will refer to this method as the adjacent wet intervals ( awi ) method .",
    "the adoption of this definition of rain event plays a central role in what is the main claim of peters et al .",
    "@xcite : a dynamical  equivalence \" between the occurrence of rain events and that of avalanches in sand pile models . in this case rain",
    "would have the same dynamical properties of self - organizing systems @xcite .",
    "these dynamical properties are commonly referred to , by the scientific community , with the term self organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "the mit and awi methods appear to be very different : the mit method looks for the lack of rain for a suitable interval of time , while the awi method looks for time intervals with a `` continuous '' presence of rain .",
    "we will compare both the mit and awi methods and provide theoretical arguments to show that the two methods are `` equivalent '' and therefore subject to the same arbitrariness : the choice of a minimum rainless interval in the mit case , and a particular time resolution of the instrument in the awi case .    as a way out from the issue of arbitrariness",
    ", we propose here to focus on the dynamical properties of the rainfall phenomenon and see if a particular time scale exists which could be adopted as a physically meaningful ( and thus not arbitrary ) rainless period ( time resolution ) in the mit ( awi ) case .",
    "there are two kinds of precipitation regimes : _ stratiform _ and _ convective _ @xcite .",
    "the words _ stratiform _ and _ convective _ do not refer to the process of cloud formation but to two distinct dynamical mechanisms of drop formation 1 ) _ stratiform _ : drops are formed via condensation which is predominant in the case of small ( @xmath22 m/s ) updraft velocity , and 2 ) _ convective _ : drops are formed via coalescence which is predominant in the case of large ( @xmath32 m/s ) updraft velocity .",
    "the occurrence of convective precipitation at mid latitudes is restricted to thunderstorm activity ( isolated summer thunderstorm or mesoscale convective systems ( mcs ) ) , while both types of precipitation occur between the tropics in spite of the fact that convection is the only mechanism of cloud formation , e.g. : @xcite .",
    "since physics laws are independent from the particular location on earth , one expects that two stratiform ( convective ) events must have some common statistical properties since the rain drops were generated by the same physical mechanism . note that the similarities we are referring to are not similarity in the duration or depth of showers , although they might exists , but similiraties in the statistical properties of inter drop time intervals and drop diameters .",
    "in other words , it is not `` how much '' or `` how long '' it rains which is similar ( since orographic condition and other particular meteorological factors may be relevant ) but `` how '' it rains .",
    "newton s law @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 tells us that body s acceralation is always proportional to the applied force , but the trajectory of a body will depend on the the peculiar force applied .",
    "eventual similar statistical properties of inter drop time intervals and drop diameters would be more easily detected by direct study rather than through the observation of rainfall rates at a given time resolution where things are complicated by the integration of the cube of the drop diameters over an arbitrary time interval ( time resolution ) .",
    "ignaccolo et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that invariant statistical properties can be obtained for the inter drop time intervals and drop diameters in the case of stratiform precipitation .",
    "we will use these properties to propose a non arbitrary definition of rain event for the case of stratiform rain , and to describe the internal variability of rain events .",
    "in this manuscript , we use data from a joss - waldvogel ( jw ) disdrometer located at chilbolton , uk for which the precipitation is almost exclusively of stratiform kind .",
    "our data span a period of @xmath82 years and are divided in 8 separate intervals of continuous observation ( all data details are in the appendix [ ourdata ] ) . in section [ droplike ] ,",
    "we review the properties of the sequences of inter drop time intervals and drop diameters which are relevant to our purposes . in section  [ arbre ]",
    ", we compare the mit- and awi - based definitions of event and show they are `` equivalent '' . a non arbitrary criterion to define rain events",
    "is introduced in section [ ourdef ] .",
    "moreover , we describe the intra event dynamical variability using the concepts of active and quiescent phases .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "rainfall is discrete process being a collection of drops . considering a small portion of earth s surface , such as the collecting area of disdrometer or a rain gauge ,",
    "rain can be described mathematically as a sequence of couples @xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath11@xmath51,2,3,@xmath12 .",
    "the symbol @xmath13 indicates the diameter of the j - th drop , while @xmath14 is the time interval ( inter drop time interval ) between the j - th and @xmath15j@xmath161@xmath17-th drop .",
    "however , every instrument designed to detect rainfall has a time resolution : the instrument integration time . as a consequence ,",
    "all inter drop time intervals of duration are lost , and all inter drop time intervals of duration are detected as dry intervals , drought , of duration @xmath18$]@xmath19@xmath20 or @xmath15@xmath18$]@xmath21@xmath22@xmath17@xmath19@xmath20 ( @xmath23 $ ] indicates the integer part ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider as example @xmath20@xmath51s .",
    "all inter drop time intervals @xmath24@xmath21s can not be detected , and the subsequent drops will `` wet '' the time intervals of duration @xmath20@xmath51s containing them . an inter drop time interval @xmath24@xmath51.3 s has 30% probability of resulting in a single dry interval ( drought of duration 1 s ) , and 70% probability of not being detected with the subsequent drop wetting the time interval containing it .",
    "a value of @xmath24@xmath53.6 s will generate 3 consecutive dry intervals ( drought of 3 s ) in 60% of the cases , and 2 consecutive dry intervals ( drought 2 s ) in the remaining 40% of the cases .",
    "the above limitations are common to the great majority of rainfall measuring instruments .",
    "the only exceptions are instruments with high temporal resolutions ( @xmath81 ms ) such as the video disdrometer @xcite .",
    "thus , given a rainfall time series one is able to calculate , in most cases , only the probability @xmath25 of observing @xmath26 consecutive dry intervals at resolution @xmath20 .",
    "a better statistical accuracy is obtained using the `` survival '' probability @xmath27 : the probability of observing @xmath26 or more consecutive dry intervals at resolution @xmath20 .",
    "neverthenless , it is possible to investigate the statistical properties of the inter drop intervals also using data with a time resolution much larger than the one offered by video disdrometer or particle spectrometer ( @xmath20@xmath281ms ) such as the time resolution of our data @xmath20@xmath510 s. in fact , it is possible to derive a formula describing the dependance of the probablity @xmath25 on the probability density function @xmath29 of having an inter drop time interval @xmath24 @xcite . in the limit @xmath24@xmath28@xmath20 ( @xmath26@xmath281 ) ,",
    "this dependence is rather simple : @xmath30 where the symbol @xmath31 indicates the probability of having an inter drop time interval @xmath32@xmath24 ( survival probability ) .      in the following ,",
    "we briefly report some statistical properties of the sequence of couples @xmath9,@xmath10 in the case of stratiform rain derived in @xcite to which we refer the reader for a detailed discussion .",
    "the statistical properties relevant for the purposes of the present manuscript are :    \\1 ) drop diameters and inter drop time intervals are not independent as `` large '' inter drop time intervals separate drops of `` small '' diameter .",
    "this conclusion was derived from the observation of the conditional frequencies for a drop diameter given a specific value of the preceeding inter drop time intervals . in particular ,",
    "inter drop time intervals @xmath3310 s are followed in @xmath395% of the cases by a drop which diameter is @xmath340.6 mm .",
    "\\2 ) large inter drop time intervals ( @xmath24@xmath310s ) are preceded / followed either by another large inter drop time interval or by a sequence of few small ( @xmath24@xmath210s ) inter drop time intervals . in this second case ,",
    "the occurrence of 5 or less drops in the 10 seconds ( a rate 0.5 drops per s ) following a large inter drop time interval is higly probable ( @xmath3295% ) .",
    "\\3 ) two different dynamical regimes of the rainfall phenomenon can be observed .",
    "these are the quiescent and active phases .",
    "the contribution to the total cumulated flux of quiescent phases is negligible ( they are time intervals of sparse precipitation ) , while non quiescent regions carry the bulk of the precipitated volume , hence they are `` active '' .",
    "[ figure1 ] is a @xmath83 days extract from our chilbolton data showing the alternance of quiescent and active phases .",
    "note that the quiescent phase is not just what is commonly referred as a dry spell or drought ( e.g. : 5 days without precipitation are obviously a quiescent time interval ) but it is a more dynamically reach concept .",
    "for example , consider the time interval 15 - 25 h as depicted in panel(b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "if one hour resolution is adopted , the time interval 15 - 25 h will result in a sequence of 10 consecutive wet intervals which could be considered as an event",
    ". however , panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows that such a sequence of wet time intervals is constituted by two quiescent phases ( almost null flux increase ) and an active phase in between ( 19 - 20 h ) in which a sharp increase of the cumulated flux occurs .",
    "the presence of quiescence and active phases is a direct consequence of properties 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "property 2 ) indicates the occurence of time intervals of sparse precipitation since large inter drop time intervals are preceded and followed by the occurrence of small rainfall rates ( @xmath340.5 per second ) . while property 1 ) indicates the arrival of drops of small diameter ( @xmath35@xmath340.6 mm ) after large inter drop time intervals genarating a negligible cumulated flux . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can use property 1 ) and 2 ) to be label as quiescent all regions with a drop arrival rate @xmath340.5 per second , and with an average drop diameter @xmath340.6 mm ( see @xcite for the detail implementation of this procedure ) .",
    "the results of this filtering process is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "we see how the described filtering procedure correctly indentifies the regions of null or almost null increase of the cumulated flux : quiescent phases .",

    "we will define the borders of this interval in the next section .",
    "note that using 1 ) , 2 ) and 3 ) , we can conclude that the inverse power law regime for the frequency of inter drop time intervals is a dynamical charateristc of the quiescent phase .",

    "moreover , we plot the number @xmath26 of consecutive dry intervals ( droughts of duration @xmath38 ) . a drought of duration 100@xmath20 is represented by a horizontal bar of 100 data points at the `` 100 '' level .",
    "each wet interval ( interval occupied at least by one drop ) is represented as a drought of null duration : `` 0 '' level .",
    "finally the continuous line represents the cumulated flux .",

    "note how the properties 1 ) and 2 ) described in section  [ stratiproperties ] create extended regions in which precipitation occurs without a detectable increase of the cumulated flux : `` quiescent '' regions .",
    "e.g. consider the time intervals 10 - 19.5 h and 20 - 26 h in panel ( b ) , or the time intervals 26.5 - 28 h and 48 - 50 h in panel ( c).,height=680 ]     in a time interval of duration @xmath20@xmath510s and the cumulated flux before ( bottom half dots and solid line ) and after ( upper half dots and dashed line ) removing the quiescent phases as a function of time .",

    "even if a physical identification of rain events based on meteorological considerations accounting for atmospheric circulation and storm dynamics is preferable @xcite , a statistical identification based on threshold criteria is widely used in hydrologic literature for its simplicity in applications .      according to the mit criterion ,",
    "a rain event is the time interval in between the occurrence of a dry period equal or larger in duration to a specific threshold : the minimum intra event time or mit .",

    "the exponents of the probability density function @xmath29 are obtained adding 1 to the exponent of the survival probability @xmath31 . moreover , for larger time resolutions the inverse power law character of the survival probability @xmath45 becomes less evident and the eventual exponent gets closer to zero : @xmath46@xmath50.14 , @xmath46@xmath50.09 , and @xmath46@xmath50.08 for @xmath20@xmath510 min , 1 h , and 3 h ( the range @xmath00.001,0.1@xmath1$]mm was used for these three last fits ) .",
    "hereby , we show that the definitions of rain event based on the mit and the awi methods are `` equivalent '' .",

    "a awi event may be split in two or more parts if the mit criterion is adopted .",

    "the only exception to this rule is the case in which the values of both @xmath43 and @xmath20 are equal to the instrument time resolution @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the mit criterion can not split awi - defined events based on the occurrence of inter drop time intervals in the range @xmath0@xmath47,@xmath48@xmath1 $ ] because these intervals have not been detected by the instrument : figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] , case @xmath43@xmath5@xmath20@xmath5@xmath47@xmath510s .",
    "finally , these figures also show that when @xmath43@xmath5@xmath20 the survival probabilities for both the mit and awi cases have similar features so that the mit and awi criteria are somewhat `` equivalent '' . to quantify this equivalence when @xmath43@xmath5@xmath20 , we consider the following variables : the number of mit - defined ( awi - defined ) events with a duration @xmath32@xmath40 @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and the number of mit - defined ( awi - defined ) events with a depth @xmath32@xmath42 @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the two couples of numbers are related as follows @xmath53 the symbol @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) in eq .",
    "( [ twonumbers1 ] ) is the number of events gained via connection of two or more mit events which singularly have all a duration ( depth ) @xmath2@xmath40 ( @xmath2@xmath42 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is the number of events lost via connection of two or more mit events which singularly had already a duration ( depth ) @xmath32@xmath40 ( @xmath32@xmath42 ) .",

    "after some algebra , we obtain @xmath62 the symbol @xmath63 ( @xmath64,@xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is the number @xmath54 ( @xmath56 , @xmath55 , @xmath57 ) divided by the total number of mit events @xmath67 .",

    "another issue related to the particular value of mit adopted is the intra event `` variability '' : namely the fact that an event is not characterized by the continuous presence of rain , but it is mostly rainless . about 75% of the event duration",

    "we think that the emergence of a power law regime for the inter drop time intervals suggests a clear ( non - arbitrary ) `` dynamical '' choice .",

    "of the 262 events available , 62 have 0 active % dep and % dur : black square in ( 0,0 ) in panel ( a ) , and left peak of the number @xmath88%dep@xmath17 in panel ( b ) .",
    "these events are produced by two different kinds of sequential ordering of inter drop time intervals @xmath24 : 1 ) a @xmath24@xmath3mit followed by a @xmath24@xmath2mit followed by a @xmath24@xmath3mit or 2 ) a @xmath24@xmath3mit followed by a quiescent phase followed by a @xmath24@xmath3mit .",
    "the first kind of sequence generates events constituted by a single drop , the second kind generates events composed by a single quiescent phase with negligible depth .",
    "the great majority of the remaining events ( 172 of 200 ) have an active % dep@xmath380% and a % dur which is mostly ( 151 of 172 ) less than 40% , as indicated by the plot of @xmath88%dur@xmath17 and @xmath88%dep@xmath17 in panel ( b ) .",
    "the left peak of @xmath88%dur@xmath17 , panel ( b ) , is given by the 62 events with 0 active % dep and % dur , and by the events with % dur@xmath345% and variable % dep ( one of the arms of the l - shaped region formed by the gray scale squares in panel ( a ) ) .",
    "finally , the region of the ( % dur,%dep ) plane defined by the condition % dep@xmath3280% ( right peak of @xmath88%dep@xmath17 in panel ( b ) ) is the region where all the `` relevant '' events ( event depth @xmath331 mm ) are located as revealed by the plot of the event depth versus the % dur and % dep variables ( vertical lines on panel ( a ) ) .",
    "note how the depth of the event with % dur@xmath345% and % dep@xmath3480% is so negligible that they are not resolved by the adopted scale for the z - axis in panel ( a ) .",
    "the question of `` what a rain event is '' has not been a simple one to answer in a statistical way .",
    "a plethora of methods have been proposed all of which affected by a degree of arbitrariness @xcite .",
    "we compare two methods for defining rain events : 1 ) the mit method , the most common @xcite , is based on defining a minimum rainless time interval @xmath43 separating two events .",
    "2 ) the awi method which is based on the occurrence of consecutive wet intervals of equal duration @xmath20 .",
    "the statistical properties of the rain event duration and rain event depth are highly dependent from the particular value of @xmath43 ( mit - events ) and @xmath20 ( awi - events ) chosen as shown by the plots of the survival probabilities ( figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] in section 3.1 and 3.2 ) .",
    "if for a given value of the parameter @xmath43 ( @xmath20 ) one could say that an inverse power law beahvior with scaling parameter @xmath46 exists for the survival probability of rain event duration and/or rain event depth , the same is not true for a different value of the parameter @xmath43 ( @xmath20 ) : either the scaling parameter @xmath46 is sensibly different or there is no inverse power law regime .",
    "consequently , claims made using survival probabilities ( and/or probability density functions ) for a particular value of @xmath43 ( @xmath20 ) should be considered void or doubtful at best .",
    "e.g. , we doubt the conclusion reached by peters et al .",
    "@xcite : inverse power law behavior for the probability of observing a rain event with depth @xmath42 , in the case @xmath20@xmath51min , @xmath89 gutenberg - richter law for rainfall @xmath89 rainfall is an example of soc .",
    "moreover , we show that the mit and the awi methods are equivalent ( if @xmath43@xmath5@xmath20 ) since the corresponding survival probabilities for the rain event duration and depth have similar behavior ( eq .",
    "( [ twonumbers1 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ twonumbers2 ] ) , and figs .",
    "[ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] of section 3.3 ) .",
    "this is so because the occurrence of adjacent wet intervals at time resolution @xmath20 is related to the not occurrence of inter drop time intervals @xmath3@xmath20 ( section  [ droplike ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the equivalence between the mit and awi methods is not perceived as such in literature : the awi method is presented as alternative method reflecting the `` burst''-like and scaling properties of the rainfall phenomenon , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this misconception is paired , in our opinion , with a lack of recognition of the drop - like nature of the rainfall phenomenon which result in the absence of detailed studies about the properties of the sequence of couples @xmath9,@xmath10 , drop diameter and inter drop time interval : @xcite being , to the best of our knowledge , the only exceptions .    yet , the statistical properties of the sequence of inter drop time interval and drop diameter ( properties 1 ) , 2 ) , 3 ) , and 4 ) of section  [ stratiproperties ] ) play a fundamental role also in answering the important question of what constitutes a rain event .",
    "we propose to use the ending time of the inverse power law regime present in the probability density function of inter drop time intervals @xmath29 as the time @xmath43 ( resolution @xmath20 ) to adopt in the mit ( awi ) method . with the data at our disposal",
    ", we estimate ( table 1 ) the ending time of the inverse power law regime to be in the range @xmath01.5,4@xmath1$]h . some considerations about this proposal",
    "are in order .",
    "1 ) the proposal takes in account only the dynamics of the rainfall phenomenon and completely ignores , as it should be , any particular time scale relative to any other hydrological processes , e.g. catchment / runoff or canopy losses , which do not have any relevance for the occurrence of rain .",
    "this is not a limitation for the possible application of the proposed method . on the contrary",
    ", it is a strength : considering only the time scale of the particular hydrological application , while ignoring those relative to the rain and the possible complicated interplay of both , is not a recipe for success .",
    "2 ) we consider this proposal valid only for _ stratiform _ rain . the term _ stratiform _ has to be intended as in @xcite : updraft velocity in the clouds are typically less than 2 m / s leading to drop formation via condensation",
    "this is the typical rain regime for chilbolton , uk , and in general the predominant one at mid - latitudes .",
    "3 ) we deem this proposal to be non arbitrary because the inverse power law regime for the probability density function of inter drop time interval is a genuine dynamical properties of _ stratiform _ rain .",
    "in fact the inverse power law regime is observed in all 8 time intervals of continuous observation , spanning almost 2 years , at chilbolton ( see @xcite ) but also in other mid - latitude locations : germany , france and italy ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "4 ) the criterion hereby discussed for a non arbitrary definition of rain event in the case of _ stratiform _ rain may have also some applicability in the case of _ convective _ rain , since _ stratiform _ precipitation occurrs inside `` dying '' cell of convective storms @xcite .",
    "finally in section 4.1 , we use the concepts of quiescent and active phases to describe the internal dynamical variability of a rain event .",
    "rain events are mostly occupied by quiescent phases which precedes and/or follows `` showers '' responsible for the bulk of the event depth ( active phases ) .",
    "there are many possible of ways of describing the rain events propeties and varability , e.g. quaterly volumes .",
    "a detailed comparison between our description of rain events in terms of quiescent and active phases and other metodology is beyond the scope of the present manuscript .",
    "the data used in this manuscript are collected at chilbolton ( uk ) using a joss - waldvogel impact disdrometer rd-69 @xcite , and provided by the british atmospheric data centre .",
    "precipitation at this location was monitored for a time interval of @xmath82 years . however , some values are indicated as missing , and the data were carefully inspected to remove chunks were no value was reported .",
    "after this inspection , 8 different time intervals of continuous observation were identified : from 04/01/2003 to 11/03/2003 , from 11/05/2003 to 01/05/2004 , from 01/08/2004 to 01/20/2004 , from 01/24/2004 to 05/11/2004 , from 05/14/2004 to 07/17/2004 , from 07/19/2004 to 08/02/2004 , from 08/04/2004 to 08/19/2004 , and from 12/10/2004 to 02/28/2005 .",
    "the instrument has a collecting area @xmath90@xmath550@xmath91 and provides every @xmath20@xmath510s the drop diameter count for 127 different diameter classes ( channels ) .",
    "the lower limit of a diameter class is defined by the following relation @xcite , @xmath92^{\\beta},\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the diameter class index , @xmath94 the lower boundary of the @xmath93-th class , , , and .",
    "thus , the range of observed diameters is @xmath00.3mm,5mm@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "( [ lowerborder ] ) makes the diameter classes uniformly spaced in a logarithmic scale so that small drops are classified through finer classes than those used for large drops .",
