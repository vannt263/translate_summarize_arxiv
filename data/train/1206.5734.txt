    "<S> the relative phase @xmath83 is set with a combination of birefringent plates.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the local oscillators that alice & bob need to reveal entanglement are obtained by impinging a bright beam on the second input of the pbs : one polarization mode is used as the quantum channel , the orthogonal one conveys the local oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that this technique can be implemented over long distances as realized in field implementation of quantum key distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase between alice s and bob s local oscillators @xmath83 is fixed by choosing an appropriate elliptical polarization of the bright beam just before the pbs @xcite . in practice , the setting difference is calibrated by observing the dephasing of interference fringes ( the quantum state is replaced here by a coherent state ) . </S>",
    "<S> a global phase averaging is obtained by sweeping a piezoelectric transducer located on the path of the bright beam before the pbs . + for each heralding event , alice & bob each obtain a real valued outcome which is extracted from homodyne photocurrents . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the main result , i.e. the observed chsh values and the separable bounds as a function of @xmath88 one sees that they both reach maximal values around @xmath89 where alice & bob ideally share a maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the small deviation between the observed value @xmath90 and the chsh value that would be obtained with a maximally entangled state @xmath91 demonstrates that the overall source and detection efficiencies are very high . </S>",

    "<S> we believe that it will naturally find applications in long distance quantum communication , allowing users to check whether two remote nodes of a given quantum network are entangled . </S>",
