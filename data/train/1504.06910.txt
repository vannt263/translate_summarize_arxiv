    "gesbte ( gst ) alloy is the most popular material for phase change memory ( pcm ) @xcite , which is one of the most promising candidates for the next - generation memory device .",
    "so far , gst thin films are deposited by physical vapor deposition such as sputtering and pulsed laser deposition .",
    "however , chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of gst @xcite has many advantages such as good step coverage , uniformity and high purity , and considered to be necessary for future pcm applications .",
    "the cvd process for gst is relatively a new field of research and there remains many things which are not clearly known .",
    "one of them is the chemical reactions in the gas phase of cvd process , and we have investigated reactions and molecules which may exist in the gas phase using quantum chemical calculation @xcite . as the result of this study ,",
    "we have obtained a data set of molecules which have bonds among ge , sb and te . in this paper",
    ", we apply our electronic stress tensor analysis based on the rigged qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) theory @xcite to this data set , and investigate how these bonds can be described by the electronic stress tensor .    in general , the stress tensor , which describes a pattern of internal forces of matter ,",
    "is widely used in various fields of science such as mechanical engineering and material science .",
    "the use of stress tensor in quantum systems as well has been investigated for many years , by one of the earliest quantum mechanics papers @xcite and many researchers @xcite including our group @xcite . in our past studies",
    ", we have shown that the electronic stress tensor and related quantities can be useful tools to analyze atomic and molecular systems and can give new viewpoints on the nature of chemical bonding .",
    "we here introduce two of our findings which we wish to investigate more deeply using gst bonds in this paper .",
    "first , we have pointed out that we may characterize some aspects of a metallic bond or metallicity of a chemical bond in terms of the electronic stress tensor @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the bonding region in the small cluster models and periodic models of li and na using the electronic stress tensor , and have found that all the three eigenvalues of the stress tensor are negative and degenerate , just like those of liquid .",
    "this is in stark contrast to hydrocarbon molecules , which have the positive largest eigenvalue much larger than the other two negative eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalue pattern of li and na indicates a lack of directionality and compressive nature of bonding while that of hydrocarbon molecules indicates solid directionality and tensile nature of bonding .",
    "each pattern well reflects the nature of metallic and covalent bonding .",
    "then , the question worth asking is , how the chemical bonds between metalloid atoms like ge , sb and te are described by the electronic stress tensor .",
    "second , using the energy density which is defined from the electronic stress tensor , new definition of bond order has been proposed @xcite .",
    "so far , we have investigated a correlation between this new bond order and bond distance @xcite , and have found that our bond order exhibits better correlation than the other bond orders proposed in the literature .",
    "we , however , have not investigated a correlation with a quantity related to energy .",
    "therefore , we wish to investigate a correlation between our bond order and the bond dissociation energy , which is available in our data set as the dimerization energy of the cvd precursors . in addition , we compute a force constant for the gst bonds and examine a correlation with our bond order .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : theory ] summarizes our analysis method of electronic structures using the electronic stress tensor density . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show the electronic stress tensor density and its eigenvalues of the gst bonds , and compare with those of hydrocarbon molecules and alkali metal clusters",
    ". we also investigate correlations between our bond order and energy - related quantities .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "in the following section , we analyze chemical bonds using quantities such as the electronic stress tensor density and the kinetic energy density .",
    "they are based on the rigged qed theory @xcite and we briefly describe them in this section .",
    "the rigged qed is a quantum field theory which has been proposed @xcite to treat dynamics of charged particles and photons in atomic and molecular systems .",
    "in addition to the ordinary qed which contains the dirac field for electrons and the gauge field for photons , the schrdinger fields for atomic nuclei are included .",
    "more details are found in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "below , @xmath0 denotes the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath1 the reduced planck constant , @xmath2 the electron charge magnitude ( so that @xmath2 is positive ) , and @xmath3 the electron mass .",
    "the gamma matrices are denoted by @xmath4 ( @xmath50 - 3 ) .",
    "the most basic quantity in the rigged qed is the electronic stress tensor density operator @xmath6 which is defined as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 ,    \\label{eq : op_stress}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the four - component dirac field operator for electrons , the dagger as a superscript is used to express hermite conjugate , and @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the spacetime coordinate as @xmath10 . the latin letter indices like @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 express space coordinates from 1 to 3 . here ,",
    "the gauge covariant derivative is defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the vector potential of the photon field operator in the coulomb gauge ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the important property of this quantity is that the time derivative of the electronic kinetic momentum density operator @xmath17 @xmath18 can be expressed by the sum of the lorentz force density operator @xmath19 and the tension density operator @xmath20 , which is the divergence of the stress tensor density operator : @xmath21 these operators are expressed as follows , @xmath22 \\label{eq : op_tension } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{c } \\left ( \\hat{\\vec{j}}_e(x ) \\times \\vec{b}(x ) \\right)^k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the electric field operator and magnetic field operator respectively , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electronic charge density operator and charge current density operator respectively .    for nonrelativistic systems , we approximate the expressions above in the framework of the primary rigged qed approximation @xcite , in which the small components of the four - component electron field are expressed by the large components as @xmath27 and the spin - dependent terms are ignored .",
    "then , we take the expectation value of eq .   with respect to the stationary state of the electrostatic hamiltonian .",
    "this leads to the equilibrium equation as @xmath28 which shows the balance between electromagnetic force and quantum field force at each point in space .",
    "since this expresses the fact that the latter force keeps the electrons in the stationary bound state in atomic and molecular systems , we can expect to study the nature of chemical bonding from the viewpoint of quantum field theory by using the stress tensor density and tension density .",
    "we express @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 for simplicity ( we also write only spatial coordinate @xmath33 because we consider stationary state ) .",
    "the explicit expression for the stress tensor density @xmath32 and tension density @xmath34 are @xmath35 , \\label{eq : stress}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36 , \\label{eq : tension}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the @xmath38th natural orbital and @xmath39 is its occupation number .",
    "@xmath40 denotes the laplacian , @xmath41 . when the density functional theory ( dft ) method is used to compute the electronic structure , we use the kohn - sham orbitals for @xmath37 in the above expressions .",
    "the eigenvalue of the symmetric tensor @xmath42 is the principal stress and the eigenvector is the principal axis as follows : @xmath43    we use a concept of  lagrange point \" @xcite to characterize a bond between two atoms .",
    "the lagrange point @xmath44 is defined as the point where the tension density @xmath45 vanishes , namely @xmath46 .",
    "we analyze chemical bonds by computing the eigenvalues of electronic stress tensor density at this point .",
    "another important quantity in the rigged qed is the electronic kinetic energy density operator defined as @xcite , @xmath47 as is done for the electronic stress tensor density operator , we apply the primary rigged qed approximation to eq .   and",
    "take the expectation value with respect to the stationary state of the electrostatic hamiltonian .",
    "then , we obtain the definition for the electronic kinetic energy density as @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : ked } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that our definition of the electronic kinetic energy density is not positive - definite . using this kinetic energy density",
    ", we can divide the whole space into three types of region : the electronic drop region @xmath49 with @xmath50 , where classically allowed motion of electron is guaranteed and the electron density is amply accumulated ; the electronic atmosphere region @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where the motion of electron is classically forbidden and the electron density is dried up ; and the electronic interface @xmath53 with @xmath54 , the boundary between @xmath49 and @xmath51 , which corresponds to a turning point .",
    "the @xmath53 can give a clear image of the intrinsic shape of atoms and molecules and is , therefore , an important region in particular .",
    "finally , in our analysis , we use the energy density @xmath55 which is defined as a half of the trace of the stress tensor density @xcite : @xmath56 it can be regarded as the energy density in a sense that the integration over whole space gives usual total energy @xmath57 of the system : @xmath58 .",
    "this can be proved by using the virial theorem . using this energy density @xmath55 , a new definition of the bond order ( bond strength index )",
    "is proposed @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath55 at the lagrange point between two atoms .",
    "our definition of bond order between atoms a and b is @xmath59 one should note we normalize by the value of a @xmath60 molecule calculated at the same level of theory ( including method and basis set ) .",
    "our data set consists of 35 molecules ( table [ tab : gstbond_1 ] , the leftmost column ) which may exist in the gas phase of cvd process for gesbte alloy .",
    "they could be formed by reactions among gst precursors and/or h@xmath61 carrier gas , and each of them has a bond between ge , sb or te atoms .",
    "their geometries and coordinates are given in the supplementary material ( fig .",
    "s1 and table s1 ) . for the precursors , we assume @xmath62-butylgermanium ( geh@xmath63(tbu ) , fig .  [",

    "[ fig : precursors](c ) ) for the te precursor @xcite .",
    "( their coordinates are given in the supplementary material , table s2 . )",
    "they are optimized by the dft method based on the lee - yang - parr gradient - corrected functional @xcite with becke s three hybrid parameters @xcite ( b3lyp ) .",
    "threshold for maximum force is set to 0.000450 hartree / bohr .",
    "the dunning - huzinaga double - zeta basis set @xcite with effective core potential by hay and wadt @xcite ( lanl2dz ) are used for ge , sb and te atoms .",
    "6 - 31g(d ) @xcite basis set is used for c atoms .",
    "d95(d , p ) @xcite basis set is employed for h atoms .",
    "total energies at 0k is obtained including zero - point energies with a scaling factor for b3lyp , 0.980 @xcite .",
    "we also use ge , sb and te crystal structures @xcite as a reference data ( see table s3 in the supplementary material for the details ) .",
    "we use the norm - conserving pseudopotentials of troullier - martins type @xcite and the generalized - gradient approximation method by perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite for density functional exchange - correlation interactions .",
    "kinetic energy cutoff of plane - wave expansion ( k - point ) is taken as 40.0 hartree ( @xmath64 k - point set ) .",
    "the electronic structures used in this paper are obtained by gaussian 09 @xcite for cluster models and by abinit @xcite for periodic models .",
    "we use the qedynamics package @xcite developed in our group to compute the quantities described in the previous section such as eqs .  , and .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing our past works on the electronic stress tensor analysis which are related to the present paper .",
    "first , it has been proposed that a covalent bond can be described by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the electronic stress tensor @xcite . in detail , the bonding region with covalency can be characterized and visualized by the  spindle structure \" , where the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor is positive and the corresponding eigenvectors form a bundle of flow lines that connects nuclei . as an example , we show a map of the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor including a region between c atoms of geh@xmath63(tbu ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : geh3tbu ] ( a ) , where we can find the spindle structure . in passing , in fig .",
    "[ fig : geh3tbu ] ( b ) , we show the tension density and the lagrange point for the same c - c bond .",
    "then , we have proposed that the negativity of the three eigenvalues of the stress tensor and their degeneracy , which is the same pattern as liquid , can characterize some aspects of the metallic nature of chemical bonding @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the three eigenvalues of the li and na clusters have almost same values while the hydrocarbon molecules have the largest eigenvalue much larger than the second largest eigenvalue , which has similar value to the smallest eigenvalue . in terms of the differential eigenvalues ,",
    "the li and na clusters have very small @xmath65 and @xmath66 which are much smaller than @xmath65 of hydrocarbons .",
    "the former degeneracy pattern indicates that the bonds are not directional while the latter indicates the clear directionality of the bonds , reflecting the metallic nature of chemical bonding in the alkali metal clusters and the covalent nature of bonding in the hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "now , let us move on to study the electronic stress tensor of the gst bonds .",
    "we first show a map of @xmath67 and corresponding eigenvector on a plane which contains a bond between gst atoms in fig.[fig : stressgst ] . we find a lagrange point between each bond and its position",
    "is marked in the figure .",
    "a common feature we see in all the six panels is that the eigenvectors form a pattern which connects gst nuclei .",
    "however , not all of them are spindle structures . as for the ge - ge ( panel ( a ) ) and ge - sb ( panel ( d ) ) bonds , since they do not exhibit a positive @xmath67 region , they are called to have pseudo - spindle structures @xcite . as for the te - te ( panel ( c ) ) and sb - te ( panel ( f ) ) bonds , although we may say they have spindle structures , the positive regions are not as conspicuous as the spindle structure of the c - c bond seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : geh3tbu ] ( a ) . as for the sb - sb ( panel ( b ) ) and ge - te ( panel ( e ) ) bonds ,",
    "the positive @xmath67 regions are even smaller .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the gst atoms have the ability to form the spindle structure in the order of te @xmath68 sb @xmath68 ge . from our viewpoint that the spindle structure is the manifestation of the covalency of chemical bonding , te contributes to covalency more than sb or ge , but less than c. the eigenvalue and eigenvector maps for the other gst molecules , which are found in the supplementary material ( fig .",
    "s2 ) , also support this ordering .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_tau33 ] , we plot @xmath67 at the lagrange point against the bond distance for all the gst molecules .",
    "the original data are found in table  [ tab : gstbond_1 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath69 for the te - te bonds and @xmath70 for the ge - ge bonds . as for the sb - sb bonds ,",
    "@xmath67 can be both positive and negative , and absolute values are smaller than those of the ge - ge and te - te bonds .",
    "@xmath67 of the ge - sb bonds exhibit intermediate values between the ge - ge and sb - sb bonds , and similarly for the ge - te and sb - te bonds . therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_tau33 ] can be interpreted that the gst atoms contribute to the positivity of the @xmath67 at the lagrange point in the order of te @xmath68 sb @xmath68 ge , which is consistent with the tendency to form the spindle structure as mentioned above .",
    "we next examine the differential eigenvalues of the electronic stress tensor at the lagrange points . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffeig ] ( a ) , we show a scatter plot of @xmath65 and @xmath66 for gst bonds , and , in fig .  [",
    "fig : diffeig ] ( b ) , we in addition plot points for the hydrocarbon molecules , li clusters , and na clusters , which are taken from the data set studied in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we see that both @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the li and na clusters are @xmath71 . as for the gst molecules , @xmath65 is @xmath72 , which is somewhat larger than @xmath66 , which is @xmath71-@xmath73 . as for the hydrocarbon molecules , @xmath65 is @xmath74 and",
    "this is much larger than @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the degree of degeneracy can be summarized as @xmath75 .",
    "this is consistent with the usual classification of ge , sb and te as metalloids , which are placed in between metals and non - metals .",
    "further research may reveal that the electronic stress tensor density provides a new criterion to define metalloids based on the electronic structures .",
    "incidentally , we compute the electronic stress tensor of ge , sb , and te crystals using periodic models .",
    "we compute the electronic stress tensor at the midpoint of two nearest neighborhood atoms ( it is the lagrange point by symmetry ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : gst_crystal ] and plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : dist_tau33 ] and [ fig : diffeig ] ( a ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffeig ] ( a ) that all the crystal structures have similar values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 to those of the gst molecules .",
    "this indicates that the degree of degeneracy does not differ much between the crystal structures and molecules . as for @xmath67 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_tau33 ] , all the crystal structures exhibit negative values of about @xmath76 .",
    "this is close to the @xmath67 of the ge - ge bonds in the molecules , but not to those of the sb - sb or te - te bonds , which , respectively , are negative with absolute values of @xmath77 or positive with values of @xmath73 .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of the electronic stress tensor , the covalency of the chemical bonding involving sb and te atoms in the gst molecules does not appear in their crystal structures and some metallicity is manifested .",
    "in other words , while ge , sb and te do not exhibit covalency in their crystal structure , sb and te show some covalency in their molecular structure .",
    "we briefly review our past works @xcite on our bond order @xmath78 ( eq .  ) , which is defined using concepts based on the rigged qed .",
    "first , it has been pointed out @xcite that @xmath78 of a single , double , and triple bond between carbon atoms in hydrocarbons is close to 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , consistent with a conventional bond order .",
    "also , @xmath78 of the c - c bond in a benzene molecule is close to 1.5 .",
    "however , it has been also reported that @xmath78 of some diatomic molecules overestimate or underestimate the conventional bond order , e.g. , @xmath78 of n@xmath61 is 7.462 .",
    "then , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the correlation between @xmath78 and bond distance @xmath79 has been investigated using various simple organic compounds . by comparing with other bond orders proposed in the literature ,",
    "@xmath78 is found to have a comparable or better correlation .",
    "this has been also shown using hydrogenated pt @xcite and pd @xcite clusters .",
    "we , however , have not investigated a correlation between @xmath78 and a quantity related to energy .",
    "therefore , we here compute the bond dissociation energy @xmath80 and force constant @xmath11 of the gst bonds , and investigate the correlations with @xmath78 .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : gstbond_2 ] .",
    "@xmath11 is calculated based on the directional derivative of a total energy @xmath57 of a molecule with respect to the bond direction @xmath81 .",
    "namely , it is computed using force constant matrix @xmath82 as @xmath83 the scatter plots of @xmath78 versus @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath11 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : be ] .",
    "we can see that @xmath78 is negatively correlated with @xmath79 and positively correlated with @xmath11 and @xmath80 , consistently with the usual notion of bond order .",
    "in fact , their correlation coefficients are @xmath84 , 0.570 , and 0.910 , respectively for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath11 . since we need to know the energy when two fragments of a molecule are infinitely apart to compute @xmath80 , it is reasonable not to find a strong correlation between @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that @xmath78 is defined only using the quantities at the equilibrium structure .",
    "on the other hand , the reason why the correlation with @xmath11 is very strong may be understood as follows .",
    "the meaning of @xmath11 , often called a spring constant , is how much energy we need to stretch the bond by an infinitesimal distance .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes the infinitesimal displacement .",
    "we may interpret this energy using our energy density @xmath55 ( eq .  ) and the  lagrange surface \" @xcite which is defined as a separatrix in the tension density @xmath45 ( eq .  ) .",
    "the vector field of @xmath45 generally has a pattern in which vectors originate from atomic nuclei , and they collide to form separatrix .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : geh3tbu ]  ( b ) or [ fig : geh3sbh2 ]  ( a ) .",
    "we call this separatrix the lagrange surface and regard it as the boundary of atoms in a molecule . in fig .",
    "[ fig : geh3sbh2 ] ( a ) , we show some examples of the lagrange surface in a geh@xmath63-sbh@xmath61 molecule .",
    "when we move apart two atoms bounded by the lagrange surface for a small distance , it may be reasonable to suppose the required energy to be proportional to the energy stored in the lagrange surface , that is , @xmath87 , where the integration is taken over the lagrange surface @xmath88 .",
    "to support this idea , we compute an alternative bond order @xcite defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the lagrange surface between atoms a and b , and investigate the correlation with @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "s3 ( c ) ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is found to be 0.887 , and the linear fit @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , represent @xmath11 and @xmath94 , gives @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "( the value of @xmath94 for each bond is summarized in table [ tab : gstbond_2 ] . )",
    "this suggests that @xmath97 holds to a large extent . as for the linear fit for @xmath78 against @xmath11",
    ", we obtain @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 is close to zero for both cases , we can approximately consider @xmath101 with a proportional constant of @xmath102 ( the ratio of @xmath103 s ) for these gst bonds .",
    "this relation between @xmath94 and @xmath78 can be confirmed directly by computing @xmath104 for each gst bond which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : besoverbe ] .",
    "the average of @xmath104 over 35 bonds is @xmath105 with the standard deviation of @xmath106 .",
    "since the standard deviation is relatively small ( 5.6% of the average ) , we may regard @xmath101 for these bonds .",
    "the values of the proportional constant derived in two ways are consistent .",
    "this relation , that @xmath94 of the gst bonds is approximately obtained by multiplying @xmath78 by a common factor , holds if the integration of @xmath107 over their lagrange surface is well approximated by @xmath108 multiplied by a common factor .",
    "such an assumption can be valid , if the lagrange surfaces of the gst bonds are flat and the energy density distributions on them are expressed by gaussian functions with a common value of the exponent .",
    "we can see this is roughly true as follows .",
    "first , the flatness can be checked by the visual inspection of the lagrange surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geh3sbh2 ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "s2 in the supplementary material ) .",
    "then , we plot @xmath107 against the distance from @xmath44 for the points which constitute the lagrange surface .",
    "the example of this plot for the geh@xmath63-sbh@xmath61 molecule is found in fig .",
    "[ fig : geh3sbh2 ] ( b ) .",
    "actually , we plot @xmath107 divided by the energy density of a hydrogen molecule at its lagrange point so that the value at @xmath44 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath109 ) becomes @xmath78 . in the figure",
    ", we also plot the result of the fit to the gaussian function @xmath110 where the exponent @xmath111 is the fitting parameter .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath112 is well fitted by the gaussian function with @xmath113 .",
    "we perform such a fit to all the gst bonds ( figures similar to fig .  [",
    "fig : geh3sbh2 ] ( b ) are plotted in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath111 are summarized in table [ tab : gstbond_2 ] and fig .",
    "s5 ) and the average and standard deviation of the exponent are computed to be 1.31 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "therefore , as for the gst bonds , we can say that the energy density distribution over the lagrange surface is expressed by the gaussian functions with a common exponent , which leads to @xmath115 .    as a further test for the idea that @xmath94 is proportional to the force constant , we examine homonuclear diatomic molecules , from h@xmath61 to i@xmath61 excluding the group 18 elements .",
    "we use experimental values for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath11 as is summarized in table [ tab : dm ] .",
    "@xmath80 is the energy of the ground state atomic products relative to the lowest existing level of the molecule , often denoted by @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath11 is converted from the frequency @xmath117 ( which is also shown in the table ) via @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the atomic mass .",
    "note that some of the experimental values are not available or controversial and we use computational values in such cases .",
    "we adopt computational values for @xmath79 and @xmath117 of ga@xmath61 from ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath79 and @xmath117 of in@xmath61 from ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath120 and @xmath94 are computed with the same setups as the gst bonds , and shown in table [ tab : dm ] .",
    "we first study how much @xmath120 is correlated with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the correlation coefficients are found to be @xmath121 , 0.834 , and 0.978 , respectively for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath11 , showing very strong correlation between @xmath120 and @xmath11 as is the case with the gst bonds . as for @xmath94 ,",
    "the correlation with @xmath11 is also very strong , with the correlation coefficient 0.990 .",
    "the scatter plots of @xmath11 versus @xmath120 and @xmath94 are shown in fig  [ fig : be_dm ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , and we can see these strong correlations ( similar scatter plots for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in figs .",
    "s6 and s7 ) . however , one may notice a difference between fig  [ fig : be_dm ] ( a ) and ( b ) that the panel ( b ) shows more proportionality than the panel ( a ) .",
    "in fact , while the linear fit @xmath122 gives @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 gives @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath128 is not negligible , @xmath120 is hardly considered to be proportional to @xmath11 , whereas very small value of @xmath129 implies that @xmath130 holds to a large extent .",
    "therefore , in general , @xmath94 is a better descriptor of a chemical bond than @xmath120 .",
    "the drawback is that , since the computation of @xmath94 involves the integration over the lagrange surface , it costs much greater than that of @xmath120 .    finally , some comments on the correlations of @xmath79 and @xmath80 with our bond orders are in order .",
    "first , the correlation coefficient between @xmath79 and @xmath78 is @xmath84 for the gst molecules and @xmath121 for the homonuclear diatomic molecules .",
    "( as for @xmath94 , they are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . )",
    "the difference can be attributed to the fact that the gst data consists of similar chemical bonds formed by ge , sb , and te , whereas the homonuclear diatomic molecule data contains various types of elements .",
    "it has been found that @xmath78 correlates well with @xmath79 , as mentioned in the beginning of this subsection , but it has been also shown that the slope on the @xmath79-@xmath78 plane depends on the type of chemical bonding .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pd - pd bonds and pd - h bonds are found to have different slopes .",
    "also , among the pd - h bonds , the bonds with shorter bond length ( @xmath133 ) have steeper slope than those with longer bond length .",
    "therefore , when a data contains different types of chemical bonding , even though @xmath79 and @xmath78 exhibit negative correlation , the correlation coefficient tends to be somewhat away from @xmath134 .",
    "second , the correlation coefficient between @xmath80 and @xmath78 is @xmath135 for the gst data and @xmath136 for the homonuclear diatomic molecules data .",
    "( as for @xmath94 , they are @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively . )",
    "there is again some notable difference between the two data sets .",
    "since the correlation coefficients between @xmath78 and @xmath11 are close to 1 for both data sets , the degrees of correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath78 are roughly equal to those between @xmath80 and @xmath11 .",
    "although @xmath80 and @xmath11 are likely to be positively correlated , since they are not linear to each other in general , we do not expect a very strong correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath11 .",
    "then , the relatively low value of correlation coefficient of the gst data is reasonable while that of the homonuclear diatomic molecules data is unexpectedly high .",
    "the latter may be understood by a universality of potential energy curve for diatomic molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) , which has been studied for a long time .",
    "it is , however , an empirical relation at this stage and the discussion of its relevance here is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have analyzed the electronic structure of 35 molecules which may exist in gas phase of cvd process for gesbte alloy using the electronic stress tensor , with special focus on the chemical bonds between ge , sb and te atoms .",
    "our study consists of two parts .",
    "first , we have studied the pattern of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the electronic stress tensor density of the gst bonds .",
    "next , we have computed the bond order which is defined by the stress - tensor - based energy density for the gst bonds , and have investigated the correlation with the energy - related quantities such as the bond dissociation energy and force constant .    in the first part",
    ", we have found that , from the viewpoint of the electronic stress tensor density , gst bonds exhibit intermediate properties between alkali metals and hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "this is illustrated by the sign and degeneracy pattern of the three eigenvalues of the electronic stress tensor density at the lagrange point between two atoms . in our previous studies ,",
    "we have pointed out that the negative and degenerate eigenvalues , which indicate a lack of directionality with the compressive stress , characterize some aspects of metallicity of chemical bonding . by contrast , the positive largest eigenvalue and much smaller negative other two eigenvalues , which indicates a solid directionality with the tensile stress in that direction , characterize covalency . the former pattern has been typically found in the alkali metals and the latter in the hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "our results in the present paper suggest that the gst bonds can be located in between metallic bonding and covalent bonding in terms of their electronic stress tensor .",
    "this is consistent with the usual classification of ge , sb and te as metalloids , which have intermediate properties between metals and nonmetals .    in the second part",
    ", we have found that the correlation of our bond order with the bond dissociation energy is not so strong , while one with the force constant is very strong .",
    "we have interpreted this results in terms of the energy density on the  lagrange surface \" , which is considered to define the boundary surface of atoms in a molecule in the framework of the electronic stress tensor analysis . in this study , we have found that both of our definitions of bond order @xmath78 and @xmath139 , where the former uses the energy density at the lagrange point while the latter involves the integration over the lagrange surface , have strong correlation with the force constant . we have argued that , if the interpretation above is correct , @xmath139 is the one which is more directly connected with the force constant , and the strong correlation of the force constant with @xmath78 follows from that with @xmath139 . in fact ,",
    "we have shown that @xmath140 does not vary much among the gst bonds , which originate from the fact that the energy distributions on the lagrange surface of the gst bonds can be well expressed by gaussian functions centered at the lagrange point and with a common value of the exponent . as the results of this study , it is hinted that the stress - tensor - based energy density can be related not only to the total energy but also to the force constant by combining with another rigged qed concept , the lagrange surface .    in our future work ,",
    "regarding the first part , we wish to apply the electronic stress tensor analysis to the other elements which are conventionally classified as metalloids , b , si and as , to see whether it can provide a criterion to define metalloids . for that purpose , it is also necessary to extend the analysis to the elements nearby metalloids in the periodic table .",
    "we also wish to apply the electronic stress tensor analysis to transition metals , ionic bonds , hypervalency , and so on , to strengthen its usefulness",
    ". it would enable us to deepen our understanding of the nature of chemical bonding .",
    "as for the second part , a further direction of the study will be to provide more evidence for our results by using other types of molecules .",
    "if the relation concerning the force constant , which is an experimental observable derived from a vibrational spectrum , is established in general , it would help to solidify such ideas as the stress - tensor - based energy density and lagrange surface . in the end",
    ", we would like to emphasize that our studies are based on the quantities defined at each point in space , which originate from the quantum field theoretic consideration and not from the electron density .",
    "we believe that our method will lead us to new and beneficial views on chemical systems .",
