    "the standard picture of the evolution of the universe relates typical observables to global scalar cosmological parameters such as the mean matter density and the global expansion rate .",
    "these parameters are derived from solutions of einstein s or newton s laws of gravitationally interacting _ homogeneous _ systems . moreover , the class of homogeneous systems is usually narrowed to the isotropic ones , in most cases to the simplest , spatially flat model , first discussed by einstein and de sitter at the beginning of this century .",
    "this _ standard model _ has survived in spite of the tremendous development of our knowledge about inhomogeneities in the universe . the key argument of applicability of the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic models is the conjecture that _ on average _ the universe may still follow the evolution of these simple models . without specifying the notion of averaging and without entering a sophisticated discussion of how one should average an inhomogeneous spacetime ,",
    "it can be definitely said that this conjecture is in itself courageous given the nonlinearity of einstein s or newton s laws , the long  range attractive forces , and the fact that the solutions are linearly unstable to inhomogeneous perturbations in the matter variables .",
    "because of the continued success of the standard model as an explanation of a variety of orthogonal observations , the need to replace the homogeneous  isotropic models by averaged inhomogeneous models is not obvious to most researchers in cosmology ( from a physical point of view it should be obvious ) .",
    "notwithstanding we will add a substantial contribution to supporting this need in the present article , shedding new light on the interpretation of observations and n  body simulations in spatial domains that cover only a few percent of the hubble volume .",
    "recent progress in the understanding of the effective ( i.e. spatially averaged ) dynamical properties of inhomogeneous cosmological models may be summarized by saying that one can unambiguously replace the standard friedmann equations governing the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic models by corresponding equations for the spatially averaged variables , provided we focus our attention to _ scalar _ dynamical variables .",
    "the averaged equations feature an additional source , we call it `` backreaction '' of the inhomogeneities on the average expansion , which will be the basis of our investigations . the restriction to scalars",
    "has its root in the averaging problem of general relativity @xcite , where a straightforward answer to the question of how one should average an inhomogeneous spacetime metric is not at hand . for scalars spatial",
    "averaging can be properly defined , provided we have a foliation of spacetime .",
    "the results of averaging the newtonian equations for the evolution of a single dust component @xcite , where also the choice of foliation is not a problem , form the basis of the current work .",
    "the corresponding equations in general relativity @xcite will also be put into perspective .",
    "we shall not review or relate other numerous work on the `` backreaction problem '' , partly because we want to concentrate on a quantitative investigation of the generalized friedmann equations @xcite , and partly because the notion of `` backreaction '' as we employ it differs from other notions ; for example , many authors study the averaging problem perturbatively in general relativity and consider as `` backreaction '' any deviation in curvature from the _ flat _ friedmann cosmologies .",
    "the approximations employed sometimes even imply that the perturbed models remain within the class of friedmann  lematre cosmologies . to review the different averaging procedures was recently attempted by stoeger et al .",
    "@xcite ; to review the vastly differing methods of how the `` backreaction '' can be estimated is a considerable , but desirable program which is also complicated by different gauge choices in a relativistic treatment .",
    "we will mention some of these works in the main text mainly to emphasize that the `` backreaction '' we are talking about is not a genuinely relativistic effect , but is naturally present in the newtonian framework as well .",
    "also , in the present work , we shift the emphasis to _ fluctuations _ of the matter variables as a result of backreaction , and we carry out this investigation within a standard cosmological model in which there is no _ global _ contribution to backreaction . in earlier , general relativistic investigations researchers mainly attempted to calculate this global effect .",
    "we shall quantify the influence of the backreaction on the expansion in finite domains , small compared to the horizon , using the newtonian approximation .",
    "consistently , we have to assume that on some ( very large ) scale the universe expands according to the friedmann equation .",
    "possible boundary conditions that respect the cosmological principle are rare and practically restricted to be periodic in which case the boundary is empty and thus the backreaction vanishes globally on the periodicity scale ( compare @xcite , especially appendix a ) .",
    "we will assume that this scale is of the order of the hubble radius .",
    "hence , with our newtonian treatment , we are not able to give any quantitative global results , but we shall see that even domains with a size of hundreds of mpc s are influenced by backreaction .    both n  body simulations and most analytical approximations using perturbation theory rely on the newtonian approximation to describe the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "the initial conditions are often specified using a gaussian random field for the density contrast .",
    "these two assumptions also enter our calculations of the backreaction .",
    "note that both the numerical and analytical approaches _ enforce _ a globally vanishing backreaction by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the inhomogeneities .",
    "however , contrary to current n  body simulations ,",
    "we are not limited by box size and resolution , but we are limited by the validity of zeldovich s approximation , which we employ as evolution model .",
    "the latter has been tested thoroughly in comparison with n  body simulations and we shall add another test concerning its average performance .",
    "we view the present work as a dynamical approach to cosmic variance : not only the density contrast , but also fluctuations in the peculiar ",
    "velocity gradient ( e.g. fluctuations in shear , expansion and vorticity ) are quantified by their effective impact on arbitrary newtonian portions of the universe . on such portions the interplay of backreaction ( condensed into an additional `` cosmological parameter '' ) with the standard parameters of the `` cosmic triangle '' ( matter density parameter , `` curvature '' parameter and cosmological constant , @xcite ) implies scale  dependence of the fluctuations of cosmological parameters .",
    "this work may be approached with the following guidelines :    * the `` cosmic triangle '' fluctuates on a given spatial scale .",
    "comparing observations on a given scale with cosmological parameters of the standard model has to be subjected to statistical uncertainties of the parameters due to backreaction .",
    "* the influence of backreaction may be two  fold : for dominating shear fluctuations the effective density causing the expansion is larger than the actual matter density , thus mimicking a `` kinematical dark matter '' ; for dominating expansion fluctuations backreaction acts accelerating , thus mimicking the effect of a ( positive ) cosmological constant . *",
    "spatial portions of the universe may collapse as a result of backreaction , even without the presence of over  densities . averaged generic inhomogeneities invoke deviations in the time  dependence of the scale factor from spherical or plane collapse .",
    "* although in some cases the backreaction source term itself may be numerically small , its impact can be large , since already a small source term is capable of driving the average system far away from the homogeneous solutions .",
    "we have chosen to organize the investigation of the effect in the following way . in sect .",

    "we may consider the proposed approximation as a prototype model of any averaged inhomogeneous cosmology asking for refinements in the restrictions mentioned .",
    "first of all we learned that the dynamics of a domain is controlled by two effective sources for the expansion rate governed by a generalized friedmann equation : the first is the over/under  density compared with the global density , usually studied by the spherically symmetric top  hat model .",
    "this effect can be absorbed into the initial conditions and the average model remains within the class of the standard friedmann ",
    "lematre solutions .",
    "the second is the backreaction term itself that measures the departure from the class of standard models .",
    "it consists of fluctuations in the kinematical parts of the velocity gradient , the expansion rate and the rates of shear and vorticity .",
    "consistently , the spherical model with an over or under  density inside the spherical domain describes the isotropic deviations from the friedmann  lematre evolution , as expressed by the vanishing backreaction term . this interpretation is valid if one considers the evolution of the whole spherical domain .",
    "locally however , we have contributions from the expansion rate @xmath25 and the shear @xmath0 , canceling only on average in the spherical domain .",
    "additionally to these isotropic deviations the plane  collapse or the more general models allow for anisotropic deviations from the friedmann  lematre evolution .",
    "one may express this directly in terms of the averaged invariants : @xmath275 is the isotropic deviation from the hubble expansion @xmath276 ; @xmath277 incorporates the shear responsible for anisotropic deviations .",
    "both the fluctuations in the expansion rate @xmath278 and @xmath277 contribute to the backreaction term .    on the basis of a first  order lagrangian perturbation approach we proposed an average model for generic initial conditions that is exact in two orthogonal cases , the plane and the spherically symmetric evolution . according to these properties",
    "the new model generalizes the spherical top  hat model .",
    "comparisons showed that the collapse is typically accelerated in this more general setting . at least down to the limit scale of the evolution model our results",
    "should be correct , i.e. for truncated high  frequency end in the initial power spectrum this is roughly the scale of galaxy clusters @xcite .    by evaluating the expectation values for the fluctuations we quantified the expected magnitudes of the parts of the backreaction term given a power spectrum of initial density fluctuations ( in our case we have chosen a standard cdm power spectrum ) .",
    "the effect may be viewed from two perspectives : a one@xmath0 fluctuation of a given part of the backreaction on some smaller scale may be alternatively viewed as a two@xmath0 fluctuation of a correspondingly larger domain .",
    "e.g. , a negative one@xmath0 fluctuation in all parts on a domain of a current radius of @xmath279mpc ( with a normalized hubble  parameter of @xmath280 , a global density parameter of unity and a zero global @xmath281parameter ) will give today a matter density parameter of @xmath282 compensated by a @xmath281parameter of roughly @xmath283 .",
    "we see in this example that the backreaction parameter itself can be negligible quantitatively ( @xmath284 ) , but qualitatively it has a strong impact on the change of the other parameters .",
    "we emphasize that this is a large effect , since a @xmath285 change of the standard parameters on a corresponding cubic volume of about @xmath286mpc is a lot for the `` innocent '' expectation values chosen at one@xmath0 .",
    "these initial fluctuations driving the non  standard evolution may arise from modes of the density fluctuations inside or outside the domain , their relative strength depending on the size of the domain and the shape of the power  spectrum considered . using the cdm power ",
    "spectrum on small scales , where modes larger than the domain with a radius of 100mpc are set to zero , the fluctuations of e.g.  the first invariant are reduced by a factor of two to three ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmas ] ) .",
    "clearly the large  scale fluctuations give the major contribution , but also fluctuations inside contribute at least 30% in this case . hence , the feasibility of a split between small and large  scale contributions critically depends on the spectrum and the size of the volume considered .",
    "consider , e.g. , the markiii and sfi catalogs of peculiar  velocities .",
    "adopting our hubble constant these samples roughly correspond to a radial depth only slightly larger than @xmath279mpc . according to what has been said before we may likely live in an `` untypical '' region when talking about @xmath279mpc .",
    "( the likelihood of such events has not been quantified in the present paper , but is a subject of ongoing work ) .",
    "we therefore think that matching results from small  scale data with , e.g. , the supernovae constraints ( see e.g.   @xcite ) has to be premature unless we do not have either a considerably larger sample , or else , know the fluctuation properties of the regional universe by other observations . since the value of the backreaction term @xmath20 depends on the velocity field inside @xmath1 , these peculiar  velocity catalogs may offer the possibility of estimating @xmath20 . in this line",
    "two papers are of particular interest : by taking the sampling anisotropies of the velocity field explicitly into account , regs and szalay @xcite found a large effect ( @xmath287 ) of the dipol and quadrupol anisotropies on the estimated bulk flow of the elliptical galaxy sample of @xcite ; using the eulerian linear approximation grski @xcite showed that the velocity field is significantly correlated even on scales of @xmath279mpc .",
    "furthermore , we may well deal with an underestimate of the effect , since our assumptions are conservative in a number of respects : + the `` zeldovich approximation '' reliably traces large  scale features but lacks structure on small scales which would add up in the averages , since shear fluctuations and expansion fluctuations are positive definite .",
    "similar remarks apply to the small  scale end of the power spectrum , which differs between models",
    ". certainly , the spectral index on large scales and the position of the bend  over plays a crucial role .",
    "thus , as a first point we may say that in the family of models usually studied the standard cdm model evolved with the `` zeldovich approximation '' may be regarded as conservative in these respects .",
    "+ we started our calculations at @xmath181 since at higher redshifts the ( linear ) power  spectrum is still changing its shape .",
    "therefore , we have to assume that the evolution of the domain follows the friedmann equation with no backreaction up to @xmath181 . our matter model ( dust )",
    "is not a good description for earlier times , however extrapolating and starting at @xmath288 , the resulting deviations increase only slightly , well below the percent range for the examples considered .",
    "+ as a third point , a conservative constraint that we have put in is the existence of a hubble flow on some large scale . from our discussion of the general relativistic case",
    "it is suggested that a realistic inhomogeneous cosmology will take its freedom to drift away from the standard model .",
    "assuming @xmath21 for all times means that we force the effect to add up to zero within the whole model for all times .",
    "this certainly hints towards an increase of the effect under study in more realistic situations .",
    "+ fourth , due to the newtonian investigation we were also conservative : in general relativity , the curvature parameter is directly coupled to the backreaction parameter . since we have learned that the newtonian @xmath64parameter plays a crucial role , this remark means that we may underestimate the curvature effect ( this has to be confirmed , however ) .",
    "+ fifth , we have been talking about `` typical '' fluctuations , e.g. , when we specified a one@xmath0 amplitude of a given peculiar  velocity gradient invariant . especially regional observational data reaching up to @xmath279mpc",
    "could well be those of an untypical region lying in the tail of the ( _ non  gaussian _ ) probability distributions for the ( second and third ) invariants .    in this line",
    "we would like to point out that , even if the fluctuations in number density ( the first moment of the galaxy distribution ) may not be present , fluctuations may show up in higher moments of the galaxy distribution .",
    "a recent investigation of subsets from the iras 1.2  jy catalog revealed large fluctuations in the minkowski functionals as well as the two  point correlations @xcite at least up to scales of 200@xmath289mpc .",
    "the iras 1.2  jy catalog is an example of a sample that may look `` homogeneous '' as far as the number density of galaxies is concerned @xcite , but features fluctuations already for the second moment and , most dramatic , for the higher moments .",
    "a number of open questions are to be considered .",
    "we already mentioned the quantification of the likelihood to find a region of a given size for given expectation values of the invariants .",
    "the probability distributions of the averaged initial invariants would allow us to set likelihood constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "another related task is to quantify cosmic variance : due to the scale  dependence of the `` cosmological parameters '' we can in principle infer their variations as a function of scale .",
    "controlling these variations allows a statistical assessment of how and if we approach a `` scale of homogeneity '' .",
    "results from spatial variations of parameters in an averaged inhomogeneous model may then be compared with observed fluctuations in galaxy or cluster catalogs .",
    "we have seen that the backreaction term , although it may be numerically small , significantly modifies the evolution of cosmological parameters , driven by the fluctuations in the velocity field .",
    "we expect exciting new insights by moving to general relativistic average models , a subject of forthcoming work .",

    "<S> e.g.   in a domain with a radius of 100mpc today and initially one@xmath0 fluctuations , the density parameters deviate from their homogeneous values by 15% ; three@xmath0 fluctuations lead to deviations larger than 100% . </S>"
