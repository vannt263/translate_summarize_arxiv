    "in triaxial - stress experiments on rocks in the brittle regime , the onset of a macroscopic localization of deformation is usually observed around peak stress ( _ c.f_.  bsuelle @xcite for a review ) .",
    "such departure from a macroscopically uniform deformation regime is intrinsically beyond the capacities of a mean - field theory , and so a specific model is developed here that takes the orientational nature of crack - to - crack interactions into account .",
    "this is the second paper in a series of three dedicated to exploring how the physical properties of disordered solids evolve as they are led to failure in a state of compression .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain a reasonable form for the hamiltonian @xmath0 which is defined as the average work required to lead an intact region at zero deformation to the crack state denoted by @xmath1 when the maximum applied strain is @xmath2 and where the final strain @xmath3 is possibly different than @xmath2 due to a final unloading .",
    "this hamiltonian must be expressed in terms of the spatial distribution of the local order parameter that is the variable used to characterize the population of cracks in each mesovolume of a huge disordered - solid system .",
    "most existing lattice models explore the dynamics of scalar order parameters either representing the breakdown of elastic spring or beam networks under tensile stress @xcite , or of fuse networks @xcite .",
    "the analogies between such scalar models and fracture of disordered media has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "one advantage of our approach is the ability to explore interactions based on a fully tensorial description of the stress perturbations produced by each crack .",
    "another is its ability to yield analytical rather than only numerical results . using @xmath4 in the partition function established in paper i , it is possible to explore the crack patterns that emerge in compressive settings for which isolated cracks appear in an intrinsically stable manner no matter their size @xcite , and for which macroscopic localization is a collective phenomenon due to the energetic organization of small cracks as opposed to an instability associated with the largest defects . in the present paper",
    ", we retain the leading - order effects of oriented - crack populations interacting in 2d .",
    "the overriding importance of the long - range elastic interactions leaves hope that 3d generalizations would not yield qualitatively different critical behavior .",
    "we now elaborate on the crack model introduced in paper i. each mesovolume of a huge rock system is discretized into a square network of diamond - shaped cells of size @xmath5 ( grain sizes ) and only a single crack is potentially present in each cell .",
    "a crack is located at the center of the cell and has a length @xmath6 somewhere within the support @xmath7 $ ] where @xmath8 is the maximum crack length ( a fixed parameter of the system ) required to satisfy @xmath9 . in the perturbative treatment of the crack interactions developed herein ,",
    "@xmath10 is taken to be a small number where @xmath11 is the number of space - dimensions ( in the present model , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the local order parameter @xmath13 associated with each cell @xmath14 is taken to have an amplitude @xmath15 and has a sign that indicates whether the crack is oriented at @xmath16 or @xmath17 relative to the principle - stress direction ( the so - called `` axial direction '' ) .",
    "the model is summarized in fig .",
    "[ orderparameter ]    the restriction that cracks are either at @xmath18 and have lengths less than the grain dimensions is of course a great simplification compared to what is found inside of real rocks .",
    "however , we only need to characterize the essential features of a crack population that contribute to localization phenomena and , to this extent , it appears overly complicated to model the amazing variety of crack geometries encountered in real rocks @xcite .",
    "the localization transition involves spontaneous breaking of symmetries both under translation and parity ( inversion of the minor stress axis ) as is seen from the structure of the shear bands emerging in the post - peak - stress regime @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of any proposed order parameter is that it must reflect and quantify the amount of local symmetry breaking and our simple model with cracks at either @xmath18 does just this .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence both from acoustic - emissions monitoring @xcite and from direct observation after unloading @xcite , that cracks developing prior to peak stress do not exceed an extent of a few grains diameters .",
    "this is principally because the grain contacts which break are much weaker than the grains and have a finite length so that cracks arriving in compression do so stably @xcite .",
    "crack coalescence is not explicitly allowed for . however , since several neighboring cells in a line may all contain cracks of the same sign , the long - range elastic effect of long ( coalesced ) cracks is effectively allowed for .",
    "our picture of the final shear bands experimentally observed in the post - peak - stress regime is that they were created by unstable sliding along a band weakened in the pre - peak - stress regime by a concentration of coherently - oriented cracks @xcite .",
    "our model allows small cracks to stably concentrate _ en chelon _",
    "along conjugate bands relative to the principal - stress direction ; however , it does not model the final unstable rupture along a given band .",
    "it has been established in paper i that to a reasonable approximation , the work required to form a crack state , as averaged over the initial disorder , separates into one part representing the work required to break the grain contacts , and a second part representing the elastic energy stored in the cracked solid .",
    "this was expressed in eqs .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the energy spent in the irreversible formation of the crack state @xmath1 averaged over quenched disorder and was obtained through an application of griffith s principle .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 derives from the quenched - disorder distribution and lies in the range @xmath21 $ ] ( see sec .",
    "iii b.2 of paper i ) .",
    "the second term is the reversibly - stored elastic energy with @xmath22 being the elastic - stiffness tensor of state @xmath1 .",
    "our principal task is therefore to model the way that cracks and collective crack states affect the overall elastic moduli of a mesovolume .",
    "this requires detailed knowledge of the stress ( or strain ) field throughout the mesovolume in the presence of arbitrary crack populations , and we treat this need using the following approximations .",
    "first , since the cracks in the model are isolated one to each cell , their main effect regarding the far - field stress is to change the elastic moduli of their embedding cell .",
    "such a change is modeled assuming the cracks to be penny - shaped ellipsoidal cavities .",
    "we ignore how such ellipses change shape when the applied stress is unloaded / reloaded since linear elasticity alone captures the principle effect of how the rock becomes weaker due to strategic placement of cracks in cells .",
    "since a crack occupies a limited extent of a cell , the modification of the moduli is small compared to the moduli of the intact cell so that the resulting far - field stress field can be developed as a born series .",
    "it is in the third term of this development that crack - to - crack interactions are first allowed for .",
    "higher - order interactions ( three cracks simultaneously interacting and so on ) are negligible to the extent that @xmath10 can be considered small .",
    "the goal of this section is to determine the elastic energy @xmath23 stored in a mesovolume occuping the region @xmath24 and containing the crack state @xmath1 ( which denotes the spatial distribution of @xmath25 at all points @xmath26 of @xmath24 ) when a displacement corresponding to a uniform strain tensor @xmath27 is applied on the external surface @xmath28 of the mesovolume .",
    "the effect of the crack field @xmath29 is to perturb the stiffness tensor of each cell as @xmath30   $ ] where @xmath31 denotes the moduli of an uncracked cell ( assumed uniform for all cells ) , and where @xmath32 is a small perturbation due to the possible presence of a crack as characterized by @xmath25 .",
