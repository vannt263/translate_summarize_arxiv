    "directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite is the generic model for nonequilibrium systems which exhibit a continuous phase transition into a unique _ absorbing state_. dp describes the temporal - directed spreading of a nonconserved agent in a certain medium . the agent might be bacteria in a case of epidemics in populations , fire in a burning forest , or water in a porous rock .",
    "the spreading phenomenon is characterized by two competing processes : relying on the medium conditions , the agent may multiply itself or decay at a constant rate . depending on the balance between these two processes , the spreading may continue forever or die out after certain time .",
    "if the agent is not allowed to appear spontaneously , in the latter case the system is trapped in the absorbing state , a configuration where the stochastic fluctuations cease entirely and the system can not escape from .",
    "these two regimes of survival and extinction are typically separated by a continuous phase transition characterized by the dp critical exponents .",
    "the dp universality class is extremely robust , as a whole range of theoretical models seems to belong to it .",
    "some examples include heterogeneous catalysis  @xcite , chemical reactions  @xcite , interface depinning  @xcite , the onset of spatiotemporal chaos  @xcite , flowing sand  @xcite and self - organized criticality  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the model has led to the conjecture that two - state spreading processes with short - range interactions generically belong to the dp class , provided that quenched randomness , unconventional symmetries , and large scales due to memory effects are absent  @xcite .    in the context of epidemics",
    ", dp describes infection processes without immunization and where the disease is only transmitted to nearest neighbors by direct contact .",
    "this can be understood realizing the problem of dp on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , where each lattice site is considered as an individual which can be _ infected _ ( active ) with probability @xmath1 or _ healthy _ ( inactive ) with probability @xmath2 .",
    "an infected individual recovers at the next time step with probability 1 and is ready to be reinfected with the same constant probability @xmath1 .",
    "the susceptibility to infection is then independent of previous infections , and this ensures the absence of immunization .",
    "therefore , in order to make a realistic description of epidemics the effect of immunization as well as long - range interactions should be taken into account as modifications of the dp model .",
    "immunization can be added to dp by considering a probability for subsequent infections different from the first infection probability  @xcite .",
    "this non - markovian feature changes the universality class of the model to the one corresponding to dynamical percolation , also known as a general epidemic process ( gep )  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of this model displays a curve phase transition line connecting the gep and dp critical points  @xcite . along this line the same universality class as gep",
    "a horizontal phase transition line also separates the gep phase from a supercritical dp behavior .",
    "the absence of scaling along this line has been shown for the case of @xmath3 dimensions  @xcite and later generalized to @xmath4 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , an epidemic model with long - range interactions was first suggested by mollison  @xcite .",
    "this model was studied as a generalization of dp which includes spatial long - range interactions where the spreading distances follow a power - law distribution given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension and @xmath7 is a control parameter .",
    "asymptotically , as @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ levyflights ] ) is equivalent to a lvy distribution and @xmath7 is called the lvy exponent . in this sense",
    "we can say that the particles perform lvy flights  @xcite .",
    "the claim that the critical exponents should vary continuously with @xmath7  @xcite was confirmed by theoretical renormalization - group analysis  @xcite as well as by extensive numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "more recently these results have been generalized to branching - annihilating lvy flights  @xcite and to the pair annihilation reaction @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "so far all these studies have assumed dynamic processes which are local in time . in the case of epidemics ,",
    "it is assumed that the infection happens instantaneously in time .    in order to make one step forward in making a more realistic model for epidemics ,",
    "in this paper we set out to study a non - markovian modification of the dp problem which includes waiting times , or _",
    "incubation times _ , between the infection and actual outbreak of the disease in a population .",
    "we assume that these incubation times @xmath10 are distributed asymptotically as @xmath11 @xmath12 here the lvy parameter @xmath13 is a free parameter that controls the characteristic shape of the distribution .",
    "for @xmath14 we assume @xmath15 is a smooth function of @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that the dynamic processes are local in space , which means that the infection can only spread by contact with nearest neighbors .",
    "the characterization of the universality class of this problem has remained an open problem in the literature since it was first suggested in a previous work  @xcite in 1999 .",
    "this is mainly because of the technical difficulties that arise in the field - theoretical description when long - range waiting times are introduced . in the present work , we derive a field theory for this problem and calculate the critical exponents by means of systematic perturbation theory and the @xmath16 expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ dplevydiscussion ] , devoted to the conclusion , we argue that our results are valid to any loop order .",
    "in order to derive the field - theoretical action for the problem of dp with incubation times , we first consider the master equation formalism .",
    "directed percolation can be interpreted as a reaction - diffusion process of identical particles in a @xmath6-dimensional lattice , where multiple occupation is allowed .",
    "we call @xmath17 the probability that the system will be at a given microstate @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamics of such a system usually is described by a master equation governing the temporal evolution of the probability distribution @xmath19 , which its general form is given by @xmath20 the system goes from the microstate @xmath18 to the microstate @xmath21 with a constant transition rate @xmath22 .",
    "a naive generalization of this to processes involving transitions with incubation times would be @xmath23 where the transition rates @xmath22 are time - dependent functions .",

    "in fact eq .  ( [ generalmasterequation2 ] ) describes the dynamics of particles , which disappear from the lattice at time @xmath25 , until they reappear at time @xmath27 .",
    "this does not correspond to the dynamics with incubation times that we are trying to model .    to write a correct master equation one should add to the right - hand side of eq .",
