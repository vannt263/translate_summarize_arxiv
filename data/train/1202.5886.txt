    "in recent years , our knowledge of low - energy pion - pion scattering has improved in a very significant way and in several respects .",
    "firstly , the high precision @xmath2 experiments performed at the bnl ags by the e865 experiment  @xcite and , more recently , by the na48/2 collaboration  @xcite at the cern sps , have provided very accurate determinations of the difference @xmath3 of the pion - pion phase shifts in the @xmath1 and @xmath4 waves in the energy range between threshold and the kaon mass .",
    "next , one should mention the measurement of the invariant mass distribution in @xmath5 decays  @xcite , that gives information on the @xmath1-wave @xmath0 scattering lengths @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , forthcoming analyses of the data collected by the na48/2 experiment on the @xmath2 decay channel into a pair of neutral pions ( for preliminary reports , see @xcite ) , or on the @xmath6 decay mode  @xcite , together with the measurement of the pionium lifetime by the dirac collaboration  @xcite , should provide additional information , and might sharpen the picture even more . in the meantime ,",
    "the accuracy obtained on @xmath7 decays from na48/2 implies that these data clearly drive the current determination of the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath4 phase shifts at low energies , and in particular of the two scattering lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for which very accurate predictions are available  @xcite .",
    "this provides a particularly stringent test of two - flavour chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , and its underlying assumptions  @xcite .    in order to extract relevant information on low - energy pion - pion scattering from the above processes ,",
    "it has become mandatory to take isospin violations into account .",
    "this is certainly quite easy to understand in the case of the @xmath5 decay , where one exploits the presence of a unitarity cusp in the invariant @xmath10 mass distribution , which occurs only if the masses of the charged and neutral pions differ  @xcite . perhaps somewhat more unexpectedly , isospin - violating corrections proved also of importance @xcite in the analysis of the @xmath2 data , in order to account for the high precision reached by the recent na48/2 experiment , and to make comparison with theory meaningful @xcite .",
    "actually , once isospin corrections are applied also to the e865 data , there remains a disagreement with na48/2  @xcite , whose origin seems to lie in the original analysis performed by the e865 collaboration ( for details , see the errata quoted under refs .",
    "anyway , the analysis of the full data set collected by na48/2 has by now completely superseded the e865 results , and one should focus on the former to study pion - pion scattering from @xmath2 decays .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose to address the issue of isospin - violating effects in low - energy pion - pion interactions using an approach based on a dispersive construction of the various @xmath0 scattering amplitudes and pion form factors in the presence of isospin breaking .",
    "ultimately , we wish to extend this program  @xcite to the @xmath7 form factors analysed in the na48/2 experiment . before undertaking this enterprise and hitting the full complexity of this four - body decay ,",
    "we want to demonstrate its feasibility and exhibit the general features of such a method by considering the somewhat simpler setting provided by the scalar and vector form factors of the pion .",
    "as far as the amplitude for elastic @xmath0 scattering in the isospin limit is concerned , the general framework has been laid down in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the explicit construction of the two - loop amplitude has subsequently been performed along these lines in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . concerning the pion",
    "form factors , the corresponding dispersive representations in the framework of the chiral expansion have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the isospin limit , but only one - loop expressions were given in analytical form .",
    "full two - loop expressions of the vector form factors have been obtained by integrating the corresponding dispersive integrals in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the two - loop expressions of the vector and scalar form - factors have also been obtained in the absence of isospin violation by the direct evaluation of feynman graphs generated from the effective chiral lagrangian at next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "a similar calculation for the pion - pion scattering amplitude in the isospin limit has been achieved in ref .",
    "finally , let us also mention that the reconstruction theorem for elastic @xmath0 scattering in the isospin limit of ref .",
    "@xcite was extended by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the whole set of scattering amplitudes involving the mesons of the lightest pseudoscalar octet .",
    "applications of this framework to the decay modes @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , have also been considered @xcite .",
    "these dispersive constructions generate subtraction polynomials with unspecified coefficients .",
    "the latter are in one - to - one correspondence with the appropriate combinations of low - energy constants and chiral logarithms that would be encountered in a calculation of the corresponding feynman diagrams generated by the chiral lagrangian . in the case of the form factors",
    ", these coefficients may be identified with their slopes and curvatures . in the case of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes",
    ", they can be expressed in terms of the subthreshold parameters occurring in the expansions of these amplitudes as taylor series around the center of the mandelstam triangle .",
    "this was the option considered in the isospin - symmetric case in ref .",
    "@xcite . by no means , however , is this choice a necessity .",
    "it has , for instance , become customary to rather let the scattering lengths play a prominent role .",
    "they have a more direct physical interpretation than the subthreshold parameters , and are thus considered as more `` experimentalist friendly '' .",
    "we will therefore also provide expressions where the subtraction polynomials are given in terms of the two @xmath1-wave @xmath13 and @xmath14 scattering lengths , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in the isospin limit . in the isospin - symmetric situation , this provides an alternative to the choice made in ref .",
    "of course , taking the expressions at two - loop order provided in the latter reference , one could convert the expressions for the @xmath0 scattering amplitude given there to the one presented here in terms of the scattering lengths .",
    "the two formulations are equivalent , up to corrections that are of higher order .",
    "in the situation where isospin is broken , this allows us to discuss the size of the corresponding corrections to the phases of the form factors in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this second option is of course the most interesting in the present context , where these scattering lengths are the quantities one would eventually like to determine from the data .",
    "it is thus important that the corrections due to isospin breaking are not studied for a fixed _ a priori _ value for them . indeed , given the precision reached by the latest experiments , one ought to perform a quantitative evaluation of the possible bias introduced if isospin corrections are evaluated for fixed values of these scattering lengths .",
    "this provides another motivation for the present work .    here",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the phases of the pion form factors .",
    "full two - loop expressions for the scattering amplitudes and form factors themselves require the evaluation of dispersion integrals corresponding to specific topologies of two - loop three - point feynman diagrams of the non - factorizing type ( `` acnode '' of `` fish '' diagrams , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "explicit analytical expressions for them do not seem to be available in the literature in the cases where several distinct masses are present .",
    "we therefore present only partially analytical expressions for the scattering amplitudes and form factors .",
    "note that a similar situation arises in the evaluation of the @xmath15 vector @xcite and scalar @xcite form factors at two loops without isospin breaking , but where the difference between the pion and kaon masses has to be dealt with .",
    "these difficulties do not show up in the computation of the phases of the two - loop form factors , where the technically most demanding step is the computation of the projections of the one - loop amplitudes on the @xmath1 and @xmath4 partial waves , which can be done analytically .",
    "coming now to the outline of this paper , our first purpose will be to extend the frameworks of refs .",
    "@xcite to the situation where the difference between the masses of charged and neutral pions is taken into account .",
    "the general framework leading to two - loop representations for form factors and scattering amplitudes when isospin symmetry no longer holds is thus described in section [ general ] . in section [ 1stiteration ] , we implement the program of constructing the corresponding form factors and scattering amplitudes at the one - loop level and provide explicit expressions for them .",
    "the second iteration , leading to two - loop representations of the form factors and the scattering amplitudes , is discussed in section [ 2nditeration ] .",
    "the issue of isospin breaking in the phases of the two - loop form factors is addressed in section [ ib_in_phases ] .",
    "section [ numerics ] is devoted to the numerical analysis of the isospin - breaking contributions in the phases of the form factors .",
    "finally , a summary of this study and our conclusions are to be found in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "this main body of the text is supplemented with six appendices , where details concerning more computational or technical aspects have been gathered .",
    "the objects of our study are the scalar and vector form factors of the pion , defined through the following matrix elements @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 respectively , in the presence of isospin - breaking corrections induced by the difference in the masses of the charged and neutral pions . in each case",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the squared invariant mass of the dipion system , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 stands for the qcd vacuum state .",
    "the mass of the neutral pion is denoted by @xmath25 , while @xmath26 stands for the mass of the charged pion .",
    "we will define the isospin limit as the case when the neutral pion mass tends to the charged pion mass , @xmath27 , while keeping the latter fixed .",
    "this explains the convention that we follow in this paper , namely that all quantities without superscript refer to the charged pion case ( default case ) , and that we refer to quantities involving neutral pions by an explicit @xmath28 superscript .",
    "the minus sign in the definition of @xmath29 reflects a choice of phase for the charged - pion states .",
    "in addition , we choose the crossing phases to be @xmath30 for charged pions and @xmath31 for neutral pions .",
    "these choices are compatible with the condon and shortley phase convention in the isospin - symmetric situation .",
    "we further assume throughout that symmetry under charge conjugation holds .",
    "these form factors , while being perfectly well - defined observable quantities in qcd , are however not observables from a strictly experimental point of view : they can only be measured indirectly , and should thus at best be considered as pseudo - observables .",
    "for instance , in the standard model , the vector form factor @xmath32 appears in the physical process @xmath33 through the exchange of a single neutral spin - one gauge boson , which in practice reduces to only photon exchange at low energies .",
    "as far as the scalar form - factors @xmath34 and @xmath29 are concerned , a similar statement can in principle also be made , but is of little use in practice , since the standard model contributions to the processes @xmath35 , arising from the exchange of a higgs particle , are well below the level of sensitivity that one could expect for any experiment of this type in the foreseeable future . despite these limitations on the experimental side ,",
    "these form factors prove useful as a theoretical laboratory .",
    "they allow us to discuss and to illustrate several issues related to the structure of isospin - breaking contributions within a rather simple context .",
    "the full complexity of experimentally more interesting situations , like the @xmath7 form factors or the decay amplitudes of light pseudoscalar mesons ( eta or kaons ) into three pions , can then be addressed on the basis of these considerations and the general framework developed here , see @xcite and the forthcoming publication @xcite in the former or the latter case , respectively .    in the present section",
    ", we aim at tackling two issues , namely discussing precisely the isospin contributions that we intend to deal with , and describing our general theoretical framework .",
    "then we can focus on the specific pion form factors that we use as an illustration .      at the fundamental level ,",
    "isospin violations have two origins within the standard model : the electroweak interactions mediated by the gauge bosons , and the quark mass difference @xmath36 , arising through the coupling of the light @xmath37 and @xmath38 quark flavours to the higgs boson .",
    "both effects contribute to the mass difference between charged and neutral pions , although the second one turns out to be marginal : the pion mass difference is mainly an electromagnetic effect  @xcite .",
    "chiral perturbation theory  @xcite including electromagnetism  @xcite provides in principle a suitable framework to deal with these isospin - breaking contributions in the low - energy domain .",
    "it has been applied to the computation of several quantities at the one - loop level , including the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes @xcite and pion form factors @xcite in the two - flavour case .",
    "unfortunately , from a practical point of view , this is not a level of accuracy able to match the experimental one in several cases of interest ( low - energy pion - pion scattering or @xmath39 decay , for instance ) .",
    "one might of course contemplate the extension of this effective lagrangian framework to next - to - next - to - leading order , but this is a more ambitious program , the interest of which might be limited eventually by the proliferation of low - energy constants .",
    "we will therefore not pursue this issue here .    instead",
    ", we will rather consider the point of view described in refs .",
    "@xcite : we thus assume a situation , as is , actually , often the case in the analyses of experimental data ( such as for e865 and na48/2 ) , where part of the radiative corrections due to real and virtual corrections have already been dealt with in some manner , while those that may remain are supposed to be negligible . in this kind of procedure ,",
    "radiative corrections of the type shown on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for instance , together with emission of soft photons , are subtracted away , but other photonic effects , like the one shown on the right - hand side of the same figure , are not taken into account , but are considered to be negligible .",
    "notice that the latter would be included in a genuine two - loop calculation in the framework of the qcd+qed effective theory .",
    "one might also think of considering the possibility of treating them in the dispersive framework that we are using here , for instance upon including also photons among the possible intermediate states in the unitarity conditions for the relevant partial waves . while this remains an interesting issue",
    ", it would however lead us beyond the purposes of the present work . within the framework assumed here , this leaves the difference in the pion masses as the only remaining source of isospin breaking that we have to consider . in practice , it means that the charged and neutral pion masses will be kept at their experimental values , but the origin of the difference in their masses will not be addressed . in other words , we assume that general properties like analyticity , unitarity , and crossing , together with chiral counting , can be used to describe a world where the charged and neutral pion masses differ , even though the interaction at the origin of this difference is not explicitly accounted for .",
    "the starting point of our study is provided by the dispersion relations satisfied by the pion form factors and scattering amplitudes . here",
    "we will only be interested in the structure of these quantities in the low - energy region . in order to obtain dispersive representations that agree with their analytic structures up to two loops in the low - energy expansion , it is convenient to consider thrice subtracted dispersion relations ( for a discussion of this issue in the isospin limit , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the pion form factors , and ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 scattering amplitude ) .",

    "the unitarity parts are given in terms of dispersion integrals , @xmath48 in the low - energy region , the form factors are analytical functions in the complex @xmath19-plane , except for cut singularities on the positive real axis , starting at @xmath49 in the case of @xmath32 , and at @xmath50 in the cases of @xmath29 and @xmath34 . for @xmath19 real and below these cuts , the form factors are real . in the chiral expansion ,",
    "the form factors behave dominantly as @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes either a pion momentum or a pion mass . furthermore",
    ", intermediate states with more than two pions contribute only from the three - loop level onwards .",
    "therefore , below the thresholds involving other states than the pions , and up to and including two loops in the two - flavour chiral expansion , only discontinuities arising from two - pion intermediate states need to be retained  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we have @xmath65 where we define the phase - space functions @xmath66    in these expressions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the @xmath1 and @xmath4 partial waves , respectively , of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes @xmath69 in the corresponding channels .",
    "these partial waves have been defined as usual by projections of the corresponding amplitudes , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 the appropriate legendre polynomials , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the relation with the mandelstam variables @xmath75 ( summing up to the squared masses of the incoming and outgoing particles ) depends on the process under consideration . for processes involving four particles with the same mass ,",
    "it is simply given by @xmath76 this is , in particular , the case for @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 ) , as well as for @xmath79 and for @xmath80 ( with now @xmath81 ) . in the reactions involving",
    "both charged and neutral pions , it becomes @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84[s - ( m_{\\pi } - m_{\\pi^0})^2 ] .\\ ] ] for @xmath85 .",
    "these expressions hold above the kinematical threshold , @xmath86 for @xmath83 , and @xmath87 for @xmath85 , for instance .",
    "let us point out that the normalization in ( [ pwproj ] ) differs from the usual definition of the @xmath0 partial - wave amplitudes by a factor of @xmath88 : it would correspond to a decomposition of the scattering amplitudes given by @xmath89 i.e. with the normalization factor @xmath90 instead of the usual @xmath91 .",
    "this modification is motivated by the fact that , in the presence of isospin breaking , the two - pion states do no longer obey ( generalized ) bose symmetry , except in the cases of two neutral pions , or of two identically charged pions . in these cases ,",
    "the appropriate symmetry factor has been included instead in the expressions of the corresponding phase spaces , cf .",

    "it is actually possible to obtain dispersive representations for the two - loop @xmath0 scattering amplitudes themselves , following the same procedure as for the form factors . as in the isospin - symmetric case",
    "@xcite , they follow from fixed-@xmath93 dispersion relations , combined with very general properties like relativistic invariance , unitarity , analyticity , crossing , and from the chiral counting properties that have just been recalled .",
    "isospin breaking is not expected to modify the asymptotic high - energy behaviour of the amplitudes , so that two subtractions should be enough in order to obtain convergent dispersion relations .",
    "we start with three subtractions in order to construct low - energy expressions of the scattering amplitudes that are valid up to and including two loops in the chiral expansion .",
    "whereas the various channels can all be described in terms of a single amplitude @xmath94 as long as isospin symmetry holds , several independent amplitudes , not related by crossing , are necessary in order to deal with all the different available channels once isospin is broken .",

    "@xcite . at order @xmath134 ,",
    "the phases of the form factors are entirely determined by the @xmath0 scattering data . in the case of the vector form factor",
    "where , due to bose symmetry , the @xmath367 channel alone contributes , watson s theorem is still operative : the phase of @xmath231 coincides with the phase of the @xmath4-wave projection of the corresponding scattering amplitude @xmath368 . for the scalar form factors , the situation is different , due to the mixing between the two channels that contribute to the unitarity sum in the @xmath1 wave .",
    "nevertheless , the phase has still a `` universal '' character , in the sense that its expression involves only the partial waves of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes , and makes no explicit reference to the form factors themselves .",

    "hence , this situation does no longer survive at the next order in the case of the scalar form factors .",
    "in addition to the universal parts , @xmath370 and @xmath371 , provided by the @xmath139 partial waves of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes , there now appear contributions @xmath372 and @xmath372 that depends explicitly on the form factors considered : @xmath373 the universal parts @xmath370 and @xmath371 correspond to the first lines of the expressions of @xmath374 and of @xmath375 given in eq .",

    "we notice that the dependence is strongest in the vicinity of the cusp , and is mainly driven by @xmath158 .",

    "as one leaves the cusp region towards larger values of @xmath19 , the contribution proportional to @xmath158 looses weight , and the variations are less ample .",
    "this behaviour is conveyed in a simple manner by the high - energy asymptotic expressions of @xmath392 , and , even more strongly , of @xmath399 : @xmath400      the evaluation of @xmath401 , the isospin - breaking effects in the phases at next - to - leading order , relies on the results obtained in the preceding sections .",
    "the corresponding numerical analysis will be the subject of section [ numerics ] below . here",
    ", we wish to proceed for a while at the analytical level , but for simplicity , and since the next - to - leading order isospin - breaking corrections are expected to be small , we will restrict ourselves to the first order in @xmath402 . for this purpose",
    ", we expand the various quantities of interest with respect to @xmath402 , and neglect contributions beyond the linear terms . in the case of the phase - space factor for the neutral two - pion state , an expansion like : @xmath403 ,     \\label{sigma_0_expand}\\ ] ] will not make sense when @xmath19 remains close to @xmath326 .",
    "this means that our expansion to first order in isospin breaking will only provide an adequate description in regions of phase space sufficiently away from the @xmath404 and @xmath405 thresholds . from an experimental point of view , this needs not constitute a serious drawback , since the vicinity of the two - pion thresholds is usually part of the regions of phase space where the acceptance is low , as can be seen , for instance , from @xcite in the case of the @xmath2 decay ( see , however , the discussion on the @xmath406 decay mode in @xcite ) . from a practical point of view",

    "this section is devoted to the numerical evaluation of the isospin breaking corrections @xmath401 keeping the full dependence on @xmath402 .",

    "more accurate determinations have appeared since then @xcite , see below .",
    "we thus merely need to evaluate the size of the isospin - breaking deviations like , say , @xmath460 .",
    "the subset @xmath152 ... @xmath455 is likewise related to the subthreshold parameters @xmath158 and @xmath160 in the isospin limit . at lowest order , these relations were given in eq .",
    "( [ alphabetalo ] ) , but in order to evaluate the phases at next - to - leading order , it is necessary to go beyond this approximation .",
    "again , we only need to know the size of the deviations from the isospin - limit quantities @xmath158 and @xmath160 .",
    "as discussed at the end of subsection [ ff_and_amp_tree ] , @xmath158 and @xmath160 represent the observables that we eventually would like to pin down from a phenomenological analysis of experimental data , so we have to trace down the dependence on these parameters beyond the lowest - order expressions .",
    "let us now explain how we proceed with these tasks .",
    "for this purpose , we briefly come back to the discussion in subsection [ sec : em_corr ] .",
    "the framework that we have presented there can be described by an `` effective '' lagrangian , whose form is similar to the chiral lagrangian used to treat electromagnetic corrections , but without including photons as dynamical degrees of freedom , as their effect is supposed to be treated by other means or otherwise to be negligible .",
    "the leading - order ( strong ) lagrangian @xmath461 is then supplemented with a contribution of the form @xcite : @xmath462 where @xmath463 is a low - energy constant that breaks isospin symmetry among the pion masses .",
    "the last term , through its transformation properties under chiral symmetry , encodes the information about the electromagnetic origin of the pion mass difference . although we could have absorbed it into the definition of @xmath463 , we have left the electric charge @xmath464 apparent , in order to make the comparison with the usual effective theory in presence of electromagnetic interactions more convenient .",
    "we call ( [ lo_eff_lag ] ) an  effective \" lagrangian since there is no identifiable fundamental theory of which it would constitute the effective theory in the usual sense , the quotation marks serving as a reminder of this limitation",
    ". nevertheless , eq . ( [ lo_eff_lag ] ) constitutes a suitable starting point for a low - energy expansion , with a well - defined and consistent power counting , which reproduces the features of the framework adopted here as far as isospin - violating corrections are concerned .",
    "thus , the  effective \" lagrangian at next - to - leading order is supplemented with the terms described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with the corresponding low - energy constants denoted with a hat , to distinguish them from those obtained in the theory with virtual photons included .",
    "indeed , the absence of virtual photons modifies the structure of the one - loop divergences , and the scale dependence of the renormalized low - energy constants @xmath465 is given by @xmath466 with ( for the low - energy constants of interest in our case ) @xmath467 one has also a contribution quadratic in the difference @xmath468 from the low - energy constant @xmath469 : @xmath470 we emphasize that these scale dependences are different from the ones of the equivalent low - energy counterterms discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we have considered a theory where no virtual photons are included .",
    "furthermore , they follow in a straightforward manner from the expressions given in eqs .",
    "( 3.9)-(3.11 ) of  @xcite upon dropping the terms that do not contain the parameter @xmath471 , with @xmath472 at lowest order , in the notation of that reference [ in the case of @xmath473 , only the terms in @xmath474 must be retained , the constant @xmath475 being multiplied by @xmath476 .",
    "the relevant subtraction constants are then obtained upon matching the one - loop expressions obtained within the framework we have just described with the representations obtained in section [ 1stiteration ] .",
    "the outcome of this exercise is displayed in appendix [ app : subtraction ] .",
    "let us recall here that there exist explicit one - loop calculations of the various @xmath0 amplitudes @xcite and form factors @xcite considered here , obtained within the full qcd+qed effective theory @xcite . as mentioned in subsection [ sec : em_corr ] , these calculations also include isospin - violating contributions arising from the exchanges of virtual low - energy photons , which are however not considered here .",
    "in order to make a comparison with these one - loop calculations , we must therefore remove the contributions of virtual photons from the expressions given in these references , and only keep the effects due to the difference of the pion masses @xcite . from a practical point of view , this can be done as described above : contributions proportional to @xmath477 , but without the appropriate @xmath478 factor , arise from the exchange of virtual photons and are discarded , while at the same time the low - energy constants @xmath479 are replaced by @xmath465 .",
    "furthermore , since we want to display the dependence on the two independent parameters @xmath158 and @xmath160 , we have , in the computation of the loop contributions , explicitly kept the quantities @xmath480 and @xmath481 defining the leading - order amplitude ( [ pipiamp_lo ] ) , for which we have then substituted the lowest - order expressions given in ( [ alpha_beta_lo ] ) .",
    "this brings in another difference with the one - loop calculations available in the literature .",
    "we wish to investigate the size of the isospin - breaking corrections as functions of @xmath158 and @xmath160 , for fixed values of @xmath228 and of the @xmath482 s .",
    "as mentioned above , the former parameters have been evaluated before @xcite using sum rules and medium - energy @xmath0 data . for the numerical evaluations below",
    ", we use the values from the `` extended fit '' of @xcite : @xmath483 let us notice that the sum rules that lead to this determinations of @xmath484 and @xmath485 also exhibit a mild dependence with respect to @xmath158 and @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "this dependence is , however , covered by the quoted uncertainties , and we will therefore not consider it further .    as far as the constants @xmath482 are concerned , we will assume that they take the same numerical values as the low - energy constants @xmath486 .",
    "even though this identification constitutes an approximation whose precision is difficult to assess , it is not obvious to consider simple alternatives to this choice at the time being .",
    "incidentally , this is also the option that was retained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to obtain numerical estimates of the @xmath486s",
    ", we proceed in several step .",
    "first , we make use of the relation between these two - flavour constants and their three - flavour counterparts @xmath487 @xcite , as worked out at one - loop level in ref .",
    "for the constants @xmath488 ...",
    "@xmath489 we then use the evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite , as given by the last line of table 1 in this reference .",
    "these determinations rely on a set of sum - rules @xcite involving qcd four - point functions , that are saturated by the lowest - mass resonances in the corresponding channels .",
    "this kind of minimal hadronic ansatz , which finds some justification in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath490 @xcite , is usually a good approximation @xcite .",
    "we therefore endow the numbers of ref .",
    "@xcite with a relative error of 33% ( 1/@xmath490 for @xmath491 ) accounting for neglected subleading effects in the @xmath492 expansion .",
    "we assign the same relative error to the constants @xmath493 and @xmath494 that were estimated along similar lines in ref .",
    "next , the relation between @xmath495 and @xmath494 also involves @xcite the @xmath15 low - energy constants @xcite @xmath496 and @xmath497 . for the latter we have taken the @xmath498 determination @xmath499 from ref .",
    "@xmath496 is not so well determined , and can induce significant differences between the patterns of chiral symmetry breaking for two and three massless flavours @xcite . for our present purposes ,",
    "we take @xmath500 , a value which was advocated on the basis of the zweig rule @xcite , even though later fits and discussions favour larger values @xcite . in any case",
    ", it turns out that @xmath501 plays only a minor role in the numerical evaluation of isospin breaking in the phases .",
    "finally , the relation between the @xmath486s of interest to us and the @xmath487s also involve four constants , @xmath502 for which there exist no reliable determinations .",
    "we have assigned an overall uncertainty of @xmath503 , based on naive dimensional analysis , to the values of @xmath504 where these constants occur .",
    "the results of this analysis are displayed in table [ tab : lecs ] .",
    "our values reproduce those given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where however an overall uncertainty of @xmath505 was assigned uniformly to all the constants @xmath506 .    for the sake of illustration",
    ", we let the parameters @xmath158 and @xmath160 vary within the intervals @xmath507 , @xmath508 , suggested by the analysis of ref .",
    "these intervals cover a reasonable range of possibilities , but of course , if necessary , other values can be considered .    to summarize , for the numerical analysis that follows we thus use as inputs the values of the constants @xmath228 in ( [ lambda_1_2_values ] ) , the values of the constants @xmath465 as given in table [ tab : lecs ] , together with @xcite @xmath509    .values of the low - energy constants @xmath510 used for the estimate of the subtraction constants .",

    "<S> dispersive representations of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes and pion form factors , valid at two - loop accuracy in the low - energy expansion , are constructed in the presence of isospin - breaking effects induced by the difference between the charged and neutral pion masses . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions for the corresponding phases of the scalar and vector pion form factors are computed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that each of these phases consists of the sum of a `` universal '' part and a form - factor dependent contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is entirely determined in terms of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes alone , and reduces to the phase satisfying watson s theorem in the isospin limit . </S>",
    "<S> the second one can be sizeable , although it vanishes in the same limit . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of these isospin corrections with respect to the parameters of the subthreshold expansion of the @xmath0 amplitude is studied , and an equivalent representation in terms of the @xmath1-wave scattering lengths is also briefly presented and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , partially analytical expressions for the two - loop form factors and @xmath0 scattering amplitudes in the presence of isospin breaking are provided . </S>"
