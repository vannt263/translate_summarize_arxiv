    "a time - dependent ( driven ) oscillator arises naturally in a number of fields of the theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has an application in cosmology and astrophysics , where the scalar , fermion , gravitational , and other quantum fields evolve in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "particle creation by the nonstationary gravitational field is long considered as one of the possible sources of the matter origin in the universe , and , to talk about a `` particle '' one has to understand what is the vacuum .",
    "it should also be mentioned that according to the modern view the vacuum fluctuations were the seeds for the structure formation in universe @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the definition of the ground ( vacuum ) state remains to be obscure @xcite .",
    "this forces one to use the well - known adiabatic states in concrete calculations @xcite , whereas for systems which admit analytical consideration , for instance , quantum field in the de sitter universe , bunch - davis vacuum states @xcite can be built .",
    "however it would be desirable to define vacuum state without appealing to the adiabatic series or analytical solution ( it may be impossible ) .",
    "this issue is addressed in our paper .",
    "the suggested method allows finding numerically the true vacuum state ( if it exists ) .",
    "let us remind the problem in more detail .",
    "hamiltonian of the time - dependent oscillator has the following form : @xmath0    its quantization in the heisenberg picture consists in a replacement of the coordinate @xmath1 by the time - dependent operator : @xmath2 where the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 obey the commutator relation @xmath5=1,\\ ] ] whereas the function @xmath6 satisfies the equation @xmath7 these rules provide the standard commutation relation for the momentum and coordinate operators @xmath8=[{\\hat { \\dot x}},\\hat x]=-\\mbox{i}.\\ ] ] the vacuum state is defined as the state , which is the null - space of the annihilation operator : @xmath9 .",
    "however , there remains a problem in the concrete definition of @xmath6 .",
    "this function satisfies the oscillator equation of motion @xmath10 and one has to define ( at some instant ) the initial condition corresponding to the true vacuum state .",
    "it should be noted that there exists a family @xcite of the functions @xmath6 , which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ rel0 ] ) and are interrelated by the bogolubov s transformation : @xmath11    in the terms of an oscillator with constant frequency @xmath12 , this means that it is necessary to differ the true vacuum from the squeezed vacuum states .",
    "when @xmath12 the vacuum choice can be made by minimization of the mean value of @xmath13 , but it is no so for time - dependent oscillator .",
    "however let us remind that when @xmath14 the mean value of an observable oscillates with time for a squeezed vacuum state , whereas it is zero or constant for a true vacuum state .",
    "one can suppose , that this is the clue to issue of the true vacuum state of time - dependent oscillator .",
    "namely , an observable value oscillates with time for a squeezed vacuum state , but it is monotonic function for a true vacuum state .",
    "it is convenient to choose the difference of the oscillator kinetic and potential energies to be this observable . for the vacuum state of oscillator with constant frequency",
    ", this quantity equals to zero according to the virial theorem and we will see that this quantity is a monotonic function of time for a vacuum state of time - dependent oscillator ( if such a state exists ) .",
    "we intend to concentrate the different examples , which grade with the asymptotic of the adiabatic parameter @xmath15 : i ) @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; ii ) @xmath18 does not tends to a constant but @xmath19 ; iii ) then @xmath20 , and , at last , iv ) @xmath21 .    let @xmath18 depends on @xmath22 in the well - known form @xcite : @xmath23    the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ rel0 ] ) and ( [ osc ] ) is @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary solution from a family of the squeezed vacuum states is given by eqs .",
    "( [ bog ] ) .",
    "mean value of the kinetic and potential energies difference is expressed as @xmath26 here @xmath27 has a sense of additional uncertainty arising in the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the arbitrary state . for a family of the squeezed vacuum states , including the true vacuum , the inequality ( [ inecv ] ) becomes an equality .",
    "cm    [ s ]    fig .",
    "[ s ] shows the @xmath32-function for different values of the parameters @xmath33 .",
    "one can see that this function oscillates at some value of the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the only parameter @xmath36 results in the monotonic behavior of @xmath32 .",
    "it should be noted that the selection rule have been offered @xcite for a vacuum state as a state having the minimal uncertainty at each moment of time .",
    "as one can see from the above example , this rule is not satisfied for the vacuum state .",
    "indeed , there exists a region in fig .",
    "[ s ] , where the uncertainty for the slightly squeezed state is less than that for the vacuum state .",
    "hence , one has to conclude that this selection rule is not valid in the general case .",
    "cm    [ sa ]    our suggestion is to correlate a vacuum state with the monotonic time - dependence of the functions @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "that is , for this example , the true vacuum corresponds to the function @xmath39 given by ( [ u0 ] ) . as the criterium for choosing the function with monotonic behavior , one can use the minimization of the functional @xmath40 where @xmath41 are some fixed values used for normalization .",
    "the exact analytic calculation of the functional with the function @xmath6 from ( [ bog ] ) , ( [ u0 ] ) and values @xmath42 , @xmath43 gives @xmath44 thus , the minimization of the functional leads to the value @xmath36 for the vacuum state .",
    "this is because the function @xmath37 has the asymptotic @xmath45 at infinity .    instead of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", one can seek the initial conditions for eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) at some @xmath46 .",
    "really , the represention @xmath47 leads to @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ rel0 ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath49 and @xmath50 define @xmath51 and @xmath52 completely because the phase @xmath53 can be chosen to be zero",
    ". then one can solve eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) with some initial conditions and find the value of the functional ( [ func ] ) .",
    "initial conditions giving the minimum of the functional correspond to the vacuum state .    moreover , one can write the differential equation directly for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "straightforward computation shows that @xmath37 satisfies the equation @xmath54 if @xmath55 obeys ( [ osc ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ rel0 ] ) leads to @xmath56 for the states belonging to a family of the squeezed vacuum states including the true vacuum .",
    "left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ unssig ] ) is the integral of motion of ( [ diffsig ] ) .",
    "one can connect the initial condition for eq .",
    "( [ diffsig ] ) with that for eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) : @xmath57    second derivative of @xmath37 can be expressed through eq .",
    "( [ unssig ] ) .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath58 and @xmath59 allows solving eq .",
    "( [ diffsig ] ) instead of defining @xmath49 and @xmath60 and solving eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) .    in the above example",
    ", the function @xmath37 has the monotonic behavior in the vacuum state within all range of @xmath22 .",
    "this means that the single global vacuum exists .",
    "the more complicated case @xcite is @xmath61 where there are two different non zero values of @xmath18 at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ sa ] , that two vacuum solutions exist .",
    "one of them has the monotonic behavior at @xmath64 ( out - vacuum state ) and the second one has such a behavior at @xmath63 ( in - vacuum state ) . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss an important issue concerning the dependencies @xmath65 providing the unique global vacuum @xcite , but if in- or out- vacuums exist , the out - vacuum can be found by the minimization of the functional ( [ func ] ) , whereas the in - vacuum state can be found by setting @xmath66 in ( [ func ] ) .",
    "the considered cases are simple in the sense that @xmath18 tends to a constant and a notion of particle is asymptotically defined .",
    "for example , the out - vacuum means an absence of the particles at @xmath62 and , simultaneously , the function @xmath37 has the monotonic behavior .",
    "cm    [ s11 ]    now let us consider the example @xmath67 where @xmath65 does not tend to a constant at infinity , but the adiabatic condition @xmath68 is still satisfied at @xmath69 .",
    "( [ osc ] ) , ( [ rel0 ] ) are solvable in the closed form @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the airi function @xcite .",
    "again , the calculation of the functional ( [ func ] ) gives eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) . it should be noted that the asymptotic of @xmath37 is ( see also fig .",
    "[ s11 ] ) @xmath72    let us come to the example , where the adiabatic condition is not fulfilled : @xmath73 the adiabatic parameter @xmath74 is constant .",
    "however , as it will be shown , the vacuum state exists in this case , as well .",
    "the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ osc ] ) , ( [ rel0 ] ) is @xmath75 and results in the following asymptotic    = 7 .",
    "cm    [ s12 ]    @xmath76    the comparison with the previous cases demonstrates that the constant component appears in the asymptotic @xcite",
    ". however , again the functional ( [ func ] ) has the form ( [ z ] ) for @xmath77 . in the opposite case",
    "the function @xmath37 has non - oscillating behavior at infinity under arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "now let us consider the following example : @xmath78 where the adiabatic parameter @xmath79 becomes greater than unity at large @xmath22 .",
    "the expression for the function @xmath39 has the form    @xmath80{h^2+k^2}}\\exp=\\left({-\\frac{\\mbox{i}}{h } { \\sqrt{h^2+k^2}\\ , \\arctan(h t ) } } \\right),\\ ] ]    as well as the expression for @xmath37 is    @xmath81    in this example , the function @xmath32 for an arbitrary state has non - oscillating behavior at infinity ( fig .",
    "[ s12 ] ) .",
    "it occurs because the function @xmath6 itself ceases to oscillate at @xmath62 . in the literature @xcite ,",
    "such a phenomenon is interpreted as the transition from the quantum field to the classical one .",
    "the behavior of @xmath37 confirms this interpretation because the absence of oscillations means the absence of interference ( i.e. , in fact , absence of the main constituent of quantum mechanics ) . in any case",
    "we can not talk about an existence of the out- vacuum state here .",
    "however , one can introduce a concept of the approximate vacuum state corresponding to some range of @xmath22 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ s12 ] , that there exists a range , where the typical non - vacuum @xmath37 oscillates and thus , an approximate vacuum state corresponding to the non - oscillating @xmath37 can be defined .",
    "in principle a number of the approximate vacuums corresponding to the different time regions can exist .",
    "let us take an example , which does not admit an analytical consideration .",
    "lagrangian corresponding to the modes of the scalar field in an expanding universe has the form @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fourier - transform of the scalar field @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the scale factor of universe , @xmath86 is the conformal time @xmath87 .",
    "the equation of motion can be deduced    @xmath88    quantization of the scalar field @xcite @xmath89 leads to the operators of creation and annihilation with the commutation rules @xmath90=1 $ ] .",
    "the complex functions @xmath91 satisfy the relations @xcite : @xmath92    substitution of @xmath93 results in the time dependent oscillator : @xmath94    = 7 .",
    "cm    [ s14 ]    = 15",
    ". cm    [ s15 ]    now we consider some illustrative time - dependence @xmath85 @xmath95 which is shown in fig .",
    "there exist three ranges , where one can search for the vacuum state .",
    "namely , one can try to find the in- , out- vacuum states and , besides , the approximate vacuum state for the central range ( from @xmath9620 to @xmath97 shown in fig .",
    "[ s14 ] ) .",
    "the numerical minimization of the functional @xmath98 where @xmath99 obeys ( [ diffsig ] ) , ( [ unssig ] ) and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , allows finding the initial conditions corresponding to the vacuum .",
    "the solutions are shown in fig .",
    "let us come to the fermionic oscillator .",
    "after decomposition of the bispinor @xmath102 in the complete set of modes @xmath103 , lagrangian of the fermion field in the expanding universe ( see @xcite and reference therein ) takes the form @xmath104    the equation of motion is @xmath105 fermion field is quantized as @xmath106 where the bispinor is @xcite : @xmath107 and spinors @xmath108 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the bispinor @xmath111 is expressed as @xmath112 , where the symbol @xmath113 denotes the transpose vector and @xmath114 . the functions @xmath115 satisfy @xcite    @xmath116    and again there appears time - dependent oscillator ( with the complex frequency ) , where the functions @xmath117 plays a role of the above mentioned @xmath118 .",
    "the true vacuum state can be defined as that providing a non - oscillating behavior of the function @xmath119 one can deduce that if @xmath120 obeys ( [ 1 ] ) then @xmath121 satisfy @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "the relation ( [ rel1 ] ) gives @xmath124 the vacuum solutions obtained by minimization of the functional ( [ func1 ] ) in the three different ranges are shown in fig .",
    "[ s15 ] ( right column ) .",
    "now we address ourself to a little more complicated system : namely , the two time - dependent coupled oscillators with constraint .",
    "this system appears in the theory of anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "one can expect , that some difficulties will arise with the vacuum definition for this system , because the quantization of constrained systems can reveals some nontrivial features .",
    "however , we will see that there are no pathologies in this particular case .",
    "both scalar field and gravitation can be assumed to be specified by the action @xcite @xmath125 , \\label{deistv}\\ ] ] representation of the metric tensor in the form @xcite @xmath126 and considering the scalar field as that possessing a spatially uniform component with a small perturbation around it : @xmath127 allows obtaining the system of equations @xcite of zero order in @xmath128 and @xmath129 ,    @xmath130    where we use system of units @xmath131 .",
    "the first order equations for the fourier - transformed perturbations of the scalar field @xmath132 and metric @xmath133 have the following form @xcite : @xmath134    eqs .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) , ( [ eqns ] ) are the equations of motion",
    ". they can also be obtained from lagrangian    @xmath135    eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) are the constraints .",
    "however , eq . ( [ c1 ] ) can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , ( [ c3 ] ) , ( [ eqns ] ) and , thus , it is not independent .",
    "that is there are two time dependent oscillators with one constraint of the first kind @xcite .",
    "using this constraint one can exclude the scalar field perturbation from ( [ c3 ] ) and obtain @xmath136 where the uniform scalar field @xmath137 has been excluded by using ( [ zeroa ] ) , ( [ zerob ] ) as well .",
    "quantization consists in    @xmath138    and the vacuum can be found by minimization of the quantity @xmath139 ( [ func1 ] ) , that allows finding @xmath140 and @xmath141 , which correspond to the vacuum state .",
    "in this we have solved eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) directly and have written the initial conditions at @xmath46 as @xmath142 , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 .",
    "these initial conditions are consistent with the relation @xmath145 which is analog of ( [ rel ] ) and corresponds to the general case of quantization of oscillator with the time - dependent mass and frequency @xcite .",
    "cm    [ s16 ]    on the other hand , one can express @xmath146 through @xmath147 , and obtain the equation for @xmath147 analogously to ( [ eqphi ] ) .",
    "this equation turns out to be more complicated and we do not write it here . the question arises : would be the vacuum state the same , if the scalar field perturbation is quantized as : @xmath148    from eq .",

    "( [ zeroa ] ) , ( [ zerob ] ) reduce @xmath150 to the form @xmath151 .",
    "let us consider the particular case of @xmath152 .",
    "the numerical minimization of the functional allows finding the vacuum solution for which the function @xmath153 has monotonic behavior and , thus , corresponds to the vacuum state .",
    "now if one expresses @xmath154 through the functions @xmath155 given by ( [ u ] ) , it is seen from fig.[s16 ] , that @xmath156 has also monotonic behavior .",
    "thus , it is the vacuum state for the @xmath147-oscillator too .",
    "moreover , one can choose any convenient variable from a combination of @xmath157 and @xmath147 as it usually done @xcite .",
    "procedure `` nminimize '' of the wolfram software `` mathematica '' is used in all the numerical calculations .",
    "we have considered the method to find the vacuum state of a driven quantum oscillator numerically by the means of minimization of the functional containing the square of derivative of the additional uncertainty @xmath37 arising in the heisenberg uncertainty relation . for a time - dependent oscillator ,",
    "the derivative of @xmath37 coincides with the difference of kinetic and potential energies .",
    "we show that this method can also be applied to both fermionic oscillator and pair of the coupled constrained oscillators .",
    "the last example is widely used in the theory of the microwave background anisotropy .",
    "we have verified that there is no problem with a selection of the vacuum state for the last system in spite of some discussions appearing in the literature @xcite .",
