    "the canonical metal - rich globular cluster ( @xmath1 > -0.8 $ ] ) has a horizontal branch ( helium core burning phase of stellar evolution ) which is compressed against the red giant branch to form a `` red clump '' ( e.g. , 47 tuc , carney et al . 1993 ; m 71 , hodder et al .",
    "standard stellar evolution theory and synthetic horizontal branches confirm this morphology ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "1990 , dorman 1992 ) .",
    "however , it is becoming clear that the situation is more complicated than this canonical picture would have us believe .",
    "first , it is evident that a significant fraction of the rr lyrae variable stars ( horizontal branch stars lying in the pulsation instability strip , hereafter rrl ) in the field near the sun are metal - rich .",
    "preston ( 1959 ) first recognized this fact , and the recent metallicity distribution of layden ( 1994 ) shows that 22% of the field rr lyrae within 2 kpc of the sun have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 , and 9% have [ fe / h ] @xmath5 dex .",
    "furthermore , the kinematics of these stars identify them with the galaxy s thick disk population , and a few rrl with abundances approaching solar may be produced by the thin disk ( layden 1995a ) .",
    "the standard horizontal branch star picture does not explain the presence of stars hot enough to lie in the instability strip at these ages and metallicities .",
    "in addition , several metal - rich globular clusters contain one or more rrl candidates ( cf .",
    "suntzeff et al .",
    "note however that the often - quoted example , v9 in 47 tucanae , has an anomalously high luminosity and long period compared with field rrl of similar abundance ( carney et al .",
    "nevertheless , layden ( 1995b ) showed that the number of rrl per unit progenitor luminosity was roughly equal between the metal rich thick disk field and globular cluster populations .",
    "this comparison was hampered by the incomplete search for rrl among the population of metal - rich globulars .",
    "a second important complication to the canonical picture of metal - rich globular cluster horizontal branches ( hbs ) is the recent observation of blue hbs in the cores of two globulars , and in several open clusters . _",
    "hubble space telescope",
    "_ observations by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed the globulars ngc 6388 and 6441 ( @xmath1 = -0.60 $ ] and @xmath6 , armandroff & zinn 1988 ) to have long blueward extensions to their otherwise red hbs .",
    "they initially suggested that age or dynamical effects could be responsible for the blue hbs .",
    "however , no deep photometry has been published for these clusters to constrain their ages , and calculations by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicated that stellar interactions are too infrequent to be the culprit .",
    "they left open the question of the physical cause of the phenomenon .",
    "blue hb stars in younger , more metal - rich open clusters have also been observed ( e.g. , ngc 6791 , kaluzny & udalski 1992 ) .",
    "theoretical studies are also focusing on the blue hb star problem .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) presented three scenarios involving enhanced helium abundance and/or stellar rotation designed to explain the blue hb observations of rich et al .",
    "they emphasized that observational tests including the existence and periods of rr lyrae variables , and the relative numbers of hb and red giant branch stars ( the @xmath7-ratio ) , could discriminate between their scenarios .",
    "they suggest that the blue hb extensions seen by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are extreme cases of the `` second parameter effect '' , in which the color distribution of stars along globular cluster hbs is seen to depend on metallicity and a second parameter , possibly age , helium or cno abundances , or core rotation .",
    "thus , ample motivation exists to study the horizontal branches and rr lyrae content of metal - rich globular clusters . with this in mind , we have undertaken a variable star survey of twelve of the metal - rich globulars listed by suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1991 ) as having poor or no variable star searches . in this paper",
    ", we report our results for the first cluster , ngc 6441 .",
    "if dynamical effects are involved , the high luminosity and central concentration of this cluster ( harris 1996 ) make it among the most likely to harbor rrl .",
    "this prospect is enhanced by the presence of the blue hb stars observed by rich et al .",
    "the best existing ground - based photometry of ngc 6441 is the photographic work of hesser & hartwick ( 1976 ) , which reached only the brightest stars on the horizontal branch .    in  2 of this paper",
    ", we describe the observation and data reduction procedures we employed . in ",
    "3 we present color - magnitude diagrams of the cluster and nearby field . in ",
    "4 we identify @xmath250 variable stars in the cluster , derive their photometric properties , and for some present their mean light curves . in  5 we derive the foreground reddening of ngc 6441 and discuss in detail the properties of the cluster s rr lyrae variables and compare them to the predictions of the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) models .",
    "we present our conclusions in  6 , and in the appendix we note details on some of the variable stars .",
    "we obtained time - series images of ngc 6441 using the direct ccd camera on the 0.9-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory during two runs in may and june of 1996 ( 3 and 8 usable nights , respectively ) .",
    "the tek#3 2048 ccd provided a 13.5 arcmin field of view with 0.4 arcsec pixels .",
    "we used filters matched to the ccd to reproduce the johnson @xmath8 and kron - cousins @xmath9 bandpasses .",
    "we processed the raw images by following the usual procedure for overscan subtraction and bias correction , and we used twilight sky frames to flat - field the data .    in each pointing toward the cluster",
    ", we obtained a short exposure ( 30100 sec ) @xmath0 frame pair and a long exposure ( 250300 sec ) @xmath0 pair .",
    "this provided two independent magnitude estimates of the hb stars at each observational epoch , and extended the dynamical range of the observations .",
    "such pointings were obtained 03 times each night .",
    "the time interval between pointings was at least 2 hours , so a typical rr lyrae ( 0.30.8 day periods ) would undergo a significant magnitude change . in total , we obtained 15 pointings toward ngc 6441 . the seeing varied between 1.2 and 3.0 arcsec ( 1.7 arcsec median ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a short - exposure @xmath8-band image of the cluster . the bright star to the west of the cluster",
    "was masked out in all the frames .    on a photometric night in may 1996",
    ", we obtained a @xmath0 image pair of ngc 6441 , together with a large number of landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standards .",
    "we also secured an off - cluster @xmath0 pair centered 13.3 arcmin north of the cluster center , outside the tidal radius ( 7.8 arcmin , harris 1996 ) designed to determine the photometric properties of the fore / background starfield .",
    "the standards covered a large range in color ( @xmath10 ) and airmass ( @xmath11 ) , and were obtained at roughly hourly intervals throughout the night .",
    "this time ( @xmath12 ) coverage confirmed that the entire night was photometric , and enabled us to seek and correct for small , slow variations in extinction . in total ,",
    "63 individual standards were observed at 13 independent epochs .",
    "the instrumental aperture magnitudes of these stars ( @xmath13 ) , in bandpasses @xmath14 or @xmath9 , were fit with the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the standard magnitude and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are the fitted coefficients .",
    "the time - dependent terms produced corrections of 0.01 mag or less .",
    "the rms scatter about the adopted fits were 0.010 and 0.013 mag in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the on- and off - cluster @xmath0 pairs obtained on this night were reduced using the daophot ii point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry package ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "the interactivity of this package enabled us to select @xmath2170 psf stars well - distributed spatially over the frame .",
    "this was critical in accurately characterizing the significant radial variation in psf across the frame . for each frame , the psf was iteratively improved by fitting and removing faint neighbor stars .",
    "the final psf was applied to the image using allstar .",
    "a second application of allstar yielded a frame with all the stars subtracted except a set of @xmath2220 bright , isolated stars .",
    "this frame was used to derive aperture corrections by subtracting the psf - fit daophot magnitudes of the stars from their aperture magnitudes ( derived using the same software and parameters as those used in measuring the standard stars ) .",
    "the aperture correction was then applied to all the stars measured in the frame , and the standard star relations were applied , yielding standard @xmath0 magnitudes for thousands of stars on the on- and off - cluster fields .",
    "the on - cluster @xmath0 data provides a set of secondary standards for calibrating the other on - cluster images .",
    "the remaining images of ngc 6441 were reduced using a version of the dophot psf - fitting package ( schechter , mateo , & saha 1993 ) which allows for spatial variations in the psf .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were obtained for each frame and combined into instrumental @xmath0 pairs , and then transformed to standard @xmath0 magnitudes via fits to the secondary standards described above .",
    "we grouped the @xmath0 frame pairs as follows : good - seeing frames with ( @xmath19 ) long , and ( @xmath20 ) short exposure times , and poor - seeing frames with ( @xmath21 ) long , and ( @xmath22 ) short exposure times .",
    "this grouping strategy minimized mis - matches due to variable depth and seeing . within each group , we spatially matched stars from the different frames , and combined the photometry for each star using an error - weighted mean .",
    "for the error in each combined stellar magnitude , we adopted the standard error of the mean for the individual measures , which proved to be a more conservative estimate than computing the error directly from the dophot errors .",
    "we combined the mean photometry from groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( the long- and short - exposure frames with good seeing ) using an error - weighted mean to produce a single dataset with maximum dynamic range . outside a radius of 1100 pix ( 7.33 arcmin ) from the cluster center ,",
    "elongated star images sometimes registered as multiple stars , compromising the mean photometry and complicating variable star detection ( see  4 ) .",
    "figure 2a shows the ( @xmath23 , @xmath8 ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for 22,871 stars on the on - cluster frame lying within 1100 pix of the cluster center .",
    "only stars detected on four or more frames , and having combined errors in @xmath8 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 mag and @xmath25 mag , are shown .",
    "table 1 lists the combined photometry for all the bright stars ( @xmath26 mag ) within 1100 pix of the cluster center .",
    "figure 2b shows the corresponding cmd for the off - cluster field .",
    "this diagram represents data from a single @xmath0 frame pair , so the errors are larger .",
    "poor photometry , galaxies , and cosmic rays were rejected by performing 3-@xmath27 cuts on the daophot values of `` @xmath28 '' and `` sharp '' as functions of magnitude . only stars with @xmath29 mag and @xmath25 mag are shown ( daophot errors ) .",
    "several features are apparent in these cmds .",
    "first , both the cluster and field have large numbers of extremely red giant stars .",
    "second , in both cmds one can detect the red clump stars of the bulge at @xmath30 and @xmath31 mag .",
    "this agrees well with photometry of the nearby field mm-5b from the ogle group ( stanek et al .",
    "note that the red clump in figure 2b is shifted redward and faintward relative to that in figure 2a , suggesting a mean reddening difference between the two fields .",
    "third , a prominent feature of the on - cluster cmd is the ngc 6441 red clump , which forms a swath of stars near @xmath32 and @xmath33 mag , running parallel to the reddening vector ( we adopt @xmath34 throughout this paper ) .",
    "finally , the on - cluster cmd shows a population of stars bluer and somewhat brighter than the cluster red clump .",
    "such stars are not present on the off - cluster cmd , and represent the first ground - based view of the extended blue horizontal branch seen by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "figures 3a and 3b zoom in on the hb regions of these cmds .",
    "the tight distribution of red clump stars in figure 3a paralleling the reddening vector suggests that there is significant differential reddening across the face of the cluster .",
    "this also explains why a tight red giant branch ( rgb ) is not seen ; differential reddening spreads the rgb stars roughly perpendicular to the un - reddened rgb fiducial .",
    "we will consider the reddening problem in more detail in  5.2 .",
    "another important feature is highlighted in figure 3c , where stars from figure 3a lying between 40160 arcsec of the cluster center are displayed .",
    "the excess of blue hb ( bhb ) star candidates seen in figure 2a is evident , indicating that they too are members of the cluster .",
    "the cluster s red clump and red giant branch are better defined in this panel as well .",
    "figure 3d shows another effort to isolate ngc 6441 stars from the field . here",
    ", we have statistically subtracted the cmd of off - cluster stars located between 40160 arcsec of the frame center from the stars in figure 3c . before subtracting , we corrected for a 0.11 mag reddening difference between the fields ( the off - cluster field has the higher reddening ) , which we estimated from the shift in color histograms of stars having values of the reddening - independent parameter @xmath35 between 12.1 and 13.3 ( stanek et al .",
    "1994 ) . for each star in the off - cluster cmd , we removed from the on - cluster cmd the star nearest in color - magnitude space . though the subtraction is over - aggressive for the faint stars ,",
    "the brighter sequences ( including the blue hb , red clump , and red giant branch ) are more clearly shown .",
    "the lack of faint , extremely blue hb stars in figure 3c , relative to their abundance in the cmd of rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , comes as a mild surprise . even in cmds where we relax the criteria on the photometric errors",
    ", these stars do not appear at @xmath36 mag .",
    "this suggests that these stars may be radially concentrated toward the cluster center , but we can not state this unequivocally without detailed completeness modeling . a simpler , more direct comparison with the rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xmath37 data will soon be available from the deep , ground - based @xmath37 photometry of the cluster recently obtained by horace smith et al .",
    "( private communication ) .    does the prominence of the less extreme bhb ( i.e. , brighter than @xmath38 mag ) vary with radial distance from the cluster center ?",
    "rich et al . ( 1997 ) found no evidence for a change in the number ratio of bhb to red clump stars with radius over their small _ hst _ field of view ( @xmath2100 arcsec , with the pc chip centered on the cluster ) , and interpreted this as evidence against the production of bhb by dynamical effects .",
    "we can extend this search to larger radii using our @xmath0 photometry .",
    "for this purpose , we defined bhb stars as having @xmath39 and @xmath40 mag , and red clump stars as having @xmath41 and @xmath42 mag .",
    "we defined the number fraction @xmath43 where the @xmath21 and @xmath44 subscripts indicate stars counted from the cluster and field photometry sets , respectively . for stars in the radial annulus 50100 arcsec",
    ", we obtained @xmath45 , while for radii of 100240 arcsec , we obtained @xmath46 . ,",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the inner annulus . for the outer annulus , they are 21 , 7 , 598 , and 77 , respectively . ]",
    "the blue hb stars are a factor of two more prominent in the inner annulus .",
    "the fokker - planck simulations of rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicated that bhb stars produced from dynamically - stripped rgb stars should be concentrated within 4 core radii ( 26 arcsec , harris 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of bhb concentration in the rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observations , and our observed concentration at larger radii do not appear to be consistent with simple pictures of bhb star production through tidal stripping of normal rgb stars by close encounters in the dense cluster core .",
    "in many clusters , relative radial population gradients are attributed to the effect of mass segregation .",
    "the relaxation time for ngc 6441 at the half - mass radius , @xmath20.5 gyr at 38 arcsec ( harris 1996 ) , is much longer than the typical lifetime of an hb star ( @xmath20.1 gyr ) , but mass segregation could be at play if the bhb stars are members of binary systems .",
    "bailyn ( 1995 ) reviewed two scenarios for producing extreme bhb stars from binaries : the merger of helium white dwarf binaries , and mass transfer in wide binaries in which the hydrogen envelope of a red giant evolving close to the rgb tip is donated to the secondary star .",
    "bailyn et al . ( 1992 ) found the latter scenario to be particularly appealing in explaining the radial distribution of extreme bhb stars in the globular @xmath50 centauri , and the scenario may be relevant to ngc 6441 as well .",
    "it explains the radial concentration of bhb far from the cluster center , and the broad color distribution of the bhb population ( the latter due to a range in mass loss , produced by a range in orbital separations ) . on the negative side , the scenario does require ngc 6441 to have a much larger population of binaries with the appropriate orbital periods ( a few hundred days ) than metal - rich clusters with `` normal '' red - clump hbs .",
    "observationally , there are few constraints on the distribution of binary periods in globular clusters .",
    "theoretically , the primordial period distribution of a cluster s binary stars could be linked to the angular momentum of the gas cloud which formed the cluster .",
    "also , dynamical evolution of the binary populations will vary from cluster to cluster ( e.g. , bailyn et al . 1992 ) .",
    "thus there seems to be no argument against the existence of large variations in the binary period distribution from one cluster to another .",
    "finally , the wide - binary scenario makes a prediction : most bhb stars should be members of a binary system , with radial velocity variations of a few tens of km  s@xmath51 .",
    "such observations should be obtainable using multi - fiber spectrographs on the new generation of large telescopes .",
    "we used the welch & stetson ( 1993 ) variability index , @xmath52 , to characterize the likelihood that a given star is a variable .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is computed for each star from the individual @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes and their errors . for a non - variable star , @xmath52 approaches zero as the number of observations becomes large , whereas for a variable , @xmath52 approaches a constant value . to minimize the effects of seeing and exposure depth ( i.e. , the blending of two nearby stars into a single measurable image as the seeing and/or signal - to - noise conditions worsen ) , we employed the frame groupings described in  2 and computed @xmath52 for each star detected more than four times in each group .",
    "groups @xmath53 and @xmath54 were useful in detecting variable stars near the cluster ( @xmath55 pix ) , and groups @xmath56 and @xmath57 were useful outside @xmath58 pix .    the morphology of the points in the ( @xmath52 , @xmath8 ) plane led us to classify stars as probable variables ( @xmath59 ) and possible variables ( @xmath60 ) . when plotted on the cluster cmd , it became clear that three classes of variables are present : extremely red variables ( mira , semi - regular , and irregular variables , hereafter lpvs ) , blue variables ( possible rr lyrae stars ) , and a few other variables scattered around the cmd .",
    "we focused on these stars as follows : all stars with @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 ( lpv candidates ) , all stars with @xmath63 mag and @xmath62 ( rrl candidates ) , and all other stars with @xmath64 .",
    "we enhanced our search for cluster rrl stars by supplementing the rrl candidates with stars in the subset @xmath65 mag , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we produced analogous lists from the data in groups @xmath54 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , and merged them into a final list of 115 variable star candidates .",
    "we then plotted the @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes as a function of time for each candidate .",
    "the lpv candidates were characterized by constant or slowly - varying @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes , with distinct jumps between the may and june data .",
    "two candidates near the cluster center were sufficiently crowded , and their light curves scattered , that we could not unambiguously characterize them as lpvs ; their positions and magnitudes are recorded in table 5 ( stars sv6 and sv7 ) .",
    "the remaining lpv stars are considered in  4.2 .    among the 56 rrl candidates ,",
    "33 had time - magnitude plots which suggested that a close pair of non - variable stars in some frames had been resolved and in others was detected as a single star ; when the photometry from the various frames was matched ( based on position ) , the blended photometry was systematically brighter than the resolved photometry , and a large value of @xmath52 resulted .",
    "inspection of the images almost always confirmed the blended - neighbor hypothesis .",
    "we discuss the remaining 23 candidates in detail in  4.3 .    of the 16 variable star candidates scattered over the cmd ,",
    "all but one were found to be false detections of critically - resolved , non - variable pairs .",
    "the single true variable has a color ( @xmath68 ) consistent with an lpv near maximum light , so we have grouped it with the other lpv stars in table 2 ( v35 ) . clearly , the large number of critically - resolved stars in this dense stellar field presents a complication to the identification of variable stars , but one that is surmountable given careful attention .",
    "the _ catalogue of variable stars in globular clusters _ ( hogg 1973 ) , as updated by clement ( 1997 ) , lists twelve variable stars in ngc 6441 .",
    "no photometric or variable - type information is given .",
    "stars v7 and v8 lie outside our field of view . only variables",
    "v1 , v6 , and v9 were detected as variables in our study .",
    "examination of the remaining stars photometry showed that v2 , v3 , v5 , and v10 are all lpvs , but were absent from enough frames due to saturation and other effects to sidestep detection .",
    "v4 showed no sign of variability in our observations , but at @xmath69 , is red enough to be an lpv ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "v11 and v12 are much fainter , bluer stars which hesser & hartwick ( 1976 ) suspected as being rr lyrae stars ; our photometry shows no sign of variability in these stars ( see table 5 and the appendix ) .",
    "data for the 31 lpv stars ( i.e. , stars which varied on timescales longer than a few days ) found near ngc 6441 are presented in table 2 .",
    "the first column gives the variable star designation ( in roughly decreasing value of the @xmath52 variability index ) .",
    "we name our newly - discovered variables v13 , v14 , etc .",
    "the second and third columns give the position of the star in the @xmath70 and @xmath71 coordinate frame of figure 1 ( in units of pixels ) .",
    "the right ascension and declination offsets from the cluster center ( in arc seconds , with positive values indicating east and north ) can be computed from the pixel positions as follows , @xmath72 the remaining columns give the magnitude - mean @xmath9 magnitude ( @xmath73 ) , the mean color ( @xmath74 ) , and the number of observations ( @xmath75 ) during the may and june observing runs . in @xmath240% of the stars , we observed a significant change in brightness or color during one or both observing runs .",
    "the previously identified lpvs not detected in our study ( see  4.1 ) are included at the bottom of this table .    clearly , the data here do not fully sample the lpvs light cycles , and thus do not accurately represent the stars mean photometric properties .",
    "still , the locations of the stars on the cmd , shown in figure 4 , approximately represent these mean positions .",
    "furthermore , the limited phase coverage leads to lpv detection incompleteness ; the observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitude differences of some true lpvs ( e.g. , v4 ) were insufficient to result in @xmath52 values large enough to trigger detections .",
    "finally , saturation and other image complications left some stars with too few observations to fulfill all the variability detection criteria .",
    "thus , it is likely that many more of the stars with @xmath61 are lpvs , in particular faint , red lpvs near the cluster center .      in an effort to determine the types of variable stars present among the 23 blue variable star candidates discussed above , we attempted to find the period of each star and create the star s mean light curve .",
    "classical period finding techniques such as fourier transforms or phase dispersion minimization perform poorly , if at all , when the data are sparse and irregularly spaced .",
    "we therefore developed the following new method .    in cases where a star s variable type is suspected ( e.g. , an rr lyrae ) , it is possible to assume a period and fit the folded light curve with an appropriate template light curve .",
    "if the assumed period is near the true period , the scatter about the fitted template will be small . by folding the time - magnitude data by a sequence of periods typical of the variable type , and fitting the template and computing the scatter ( or @xmath76 ) at each period , one can easily identify @xmath76 minima indicative of possible periods .",
    "this method is similar to that described by stetson ( 1996 ) .    in practice",
    ", we used the template - fitting procedure described in layden ( 1998 ) .",
    "we fit each star with three templates ; @xmath77 and @xmath78 from layden ( 1998 , table 4 ) are typical of rra and rrb type variables , respectively , while a cosine curve was used to represent rrc and contact binary lcs .",
    "we fit the templates over periods ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 days , increasing the period by 0.1% from one step to the next . if no suitable minima were found , we searched on the period interval 13 days .",
    "periods longer than 3 days are evident in the time - magnitude plots . since the templates are seldom a perfect match for the actual lcs , we refined the periods by folding the time - magnitude data by a sequence of periods near the @xmath76 minimum , plotting the resulting lcs , and chosing the cleanest lc .",
    "this resulted in tighter lcs and improved periods .",
    "we note that this technique should be applicable to any type of variable with a characteristic lc . indeed , by including template lcs from a large number of variable types",
    ", it should be possible to determine both period _ and _ variable star type from the template giving the smallest @xmath76 value .    of the 23 blue variable candidates",
    ", we were able to determine periods for 11 rr lyrae stars ( v36v46 ) and two contact binaries ( v48 and v50 ) .",
    "light curves for two detached binaries ( v49 and v51 ) and one long period star ( v6 , a cepheid ? ) were obtained by examination of the time - magnitude plots .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 light curves of these 15 stars are presented in figure 5 .",
    "possible periods were obtained for five additional stars ( sv1sv5 , see table 5 ) .",
    "we were unable to determine with certainty whether these stars were low - amplitude rr lyrae or contact eclipsing binaries ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we were unable to obtain periods or lcs for the remaining two blue variable candidates , which we list in table 5 as sv8 and sv9 .",
    "table 3 lists the photometric properties of the 11 rr lyrae stars .",
    "columns include the location of the stars in the coordinate frame of figure 1 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) , the period in days , the intensity - mean @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , the @xmath8-band amplitude ( @xmath83 ) , the mean color during the phase interval 0.50.8 ( @xmath84 ) , and a brief comment . for several stars ,",
    "a few discrepant data points were omitted from the computations , ( e.g. , v37 ) , while for several other stars , only good - seeing data were used ( e.g. , v42 and v43 ) .",

    "a set of five lpvs appears to parallel this sequence @xmath20.8 mag brighter .",
    "these five stars ( v3 , v5 , v9 , v30 , and v31 ) have a cumulative radial distribution consistent with a uniform foreground population . given that the distance modulus difference between the cluster and the bulge is @xmath20.8 mag , based on the offset in @xmath8 magnitudes of the red clumps and rrl stars , it seems reasonable to conclude that these five bright lpvs belong to the bulge , rather than the cluster .    the population of the two lpvs @xmath21.0 mag fainter than the cluster lpv sequence is unclear .",

    "complete light curve coverage of these variables would enable estimates of their distances , while spectroscopy would indicate whether their radial velocities are consistent with an origin in the galaxy or in sagittarius .    finally , we consider the variables of uncertain type from table 5 . of these five stars , sv2 , sv3 , and sv5",

    "( 1978 ) .    of these stars , only v36 is a `` typical '' rrl , judging from its position in the period - amplitude diagram and its expected location in the galactic bulge .",
    "indeed , one could question whether the @xmath112 colors of bulge rrl are the same as the local stars used to calibrate the relation .",
    "it is reassuring that v36 gives @xmath113 mag , in excellent agreement with the existing reddening values .",
    "does the relationship work for the atypical , long - period variables in ngc 6441 ?",
    "unfortunately , @xmath23 colors do not exist for the two other known members of this class , v9 in 47 tuc and v28 in ngc 6388 .",
    "however , the data from carney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) on v9 indicates that the analogous relation employing @xmath114 , period , and metallicity ( blanco 1992 and references therein ) _ does _ work , yielding @xmath115 . for comparison , harris s ( 1996 ) compilation lists @xmath116 . with this encouragement , and excluding the two anomalously red and bright stars v41 and v44 , we find the mean @xmath110 of the nine rrl toward ngc 6441 to be 0.45 mag ( 0.05 mag rms ) .",
    "again , our reddening estimate is in excellent agreement with the existing estimates .",
    "the rms value is somewhat larger than expected from the estimated uncertainties ( @xmath20.03 mag for a single star ) .",
    "this suggests there may be some differential reddening across the face of the cluster .",
    "the extension of the cluster red clump along the reddening vector and the absence of a well - defined red giant branch provide similar evidence ( see  3 ) .",
    "to search for further evidence of spatially - variable reddening , we considered individually the cmds of stars lying in eight equal - sized sectors of an annulus with radius 40100 arcsec centered on the cluster ( the angles @xmath117 and @xmath118 in table 7 define the bounds of each sector , and are measured counter - clockwise from a line radiating in the + @xmath119 direction from the cluster center in figure 1 ) . for each cmd , we isolated the red clump stars using @xmath120 and produced their generalized color histogram ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "several curves are substantially displaced towards redder colors , indicating the presence of differential reddening .",
    "sector 4 is particularly noticeable .",
    "the median @xmath23 color of each histogram ( @xmath121 ) , and the number of stars involved ( @xmath122 ) , are shown in table 7 .",
    "the widths of the individual histograms are not drastically larger than the color width of the red clump in 47 tuc ( @xmath20.2 mag , armandroff 1988 ) , suggesting that the effects of differential reddening within a given sector are small , though red giant branches in the cmds are still noticeably broadened ( especially in sector 4 ) .",
    "the small - scale peaks in the figure 10 histograms are due to shot noise , indicating that further spatial segregation of the cluster is not warranted .    in an effort to recover the de - reddened cmd of the cluster",
    ", we corrected the differential reddening in the individual sectors to a representative mean ( @xmath123 , the average of sectors 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 ) , and then corrected the entire dataset for the average rrl reddening ( @xmath124 , based on the rrl stars in or near those sectors ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath34 .",
    "the de - reddened cmd is shown in figure 11 .",
    "the principal sequences seem to have tightened up somewhat , compared with figure 3c . however , the slope of the red clump stars persists , confirming the rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) _ hst _ photometry .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) note that this intrinsic slope rules out older cluster age or extreme mass loss on the giant branch as causes of the extended blue hb seen in ngc 6441 .",
    "the nature of the variables v41 and v44 is unclear .",
    "their lcs suggest they are rr lyrae stars , or possibly another class of pulsating variable .",
    "they are both @xmath20.7 mag brighter , and @xmath20.3 mag redder , than the other eight cluster rr lyrae .",
    "both are located close to the cluster center ( 63 and 57 arcsec , respectively ) , so are likely to be members .",
    "one possibility is that they are type ii cepheids belonging to the cluster .",
    "however , we searched for periods between 1 and 5 days and found no reasonable minima , and the time - magnitude plots indicate shorter period variations .",
    "anomalous cepheids have periods between 0.36 and 1.6 days , absolute magnitudes between 0.5 and 2 mag brighter than rrl , and colors comparable to rrl ( nemec et al .",
    "based on the first two criteria , v41 and v44 could be anomalous cepheids",
    ". however , both stars are significantly redder than the rrl in ngc 6441 .",
    "furthermore , most anomalous cepheids are found in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , metal - poor systems with a component of younger stars ( @xmath125510 gyr , mateo et al .",
    "bono et al .",
    "( 1997a ) confirm theoretically that the minimum mass for the formation of anomalous cepheids is @xmath21.8 @xmath126 at @xmath1 = -1.7 $ ] , and this minimum increases quickly with increasing metal abundance .",
    "it seems unlikely that ngc 6441 possesses a population of stars young enough to produce hb stars of this mass .",
    "it may also be possible to produce anomalous cepheids through binary star coalescence , but at the metallicity of ngc 6441 , the mass limit appears incompatible with turnoff stars of globular cluster age ( @xmath127 ) . given these complications , and that we are not aware of the existence of any metal - rich examples of this type of variable , it seems unlikely that v41 and v44 are anomalous cepheids .",
    "another possibility is that v41 and v44 are rr lyrae stars in the foreground bulge .",
    "the similarity of their @xmath8 magnitudes to that of v36 supports this idea , but their much redder @xmath23 colors would require a large amount of differential reddening . the two stars _ do _ lie near each other , 21 arcsec apart in sector 3 ; perhaps they lie behind a small , dense foreground dust cloud . to test this",
    ", we extracted a subset of the stars in table 1 which lie within 20 arcsec of the stars centroid , and plotted their cmd .",
    "it shows no displacement relative to the cmd of the other stars in sector 3 , nor to figure 3c , indicating that heavy differential obscuration is _ not _",
    "responsible for the anomalous colors of these stars .",
    "furthermore , the central location of v41 and v44 argues strongly for cluster membership .",
    "if they belong to the field , the probability of both variables lying inside 63 arcsec radius is @xmath128 .",
    "a third possibility is that v41 and v44 are cluster rrl whose photometry has been contaminated by another star .",
    "if the rrl components are typical of the other eight cluster rrl , then the contaminating stars must have @xmath129 and @xmath130 , roughly like those of cluster red clump stars .",
    "the positions of v41 and v44 in the period - amplitude diagram ( figure 9 ) are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the observed amplitudes are small compared with the other rrl in ngc 6441 with the same period , but the amplitudes become consistent with these stars when corrected for the effect of the photometric companion just described : the @xmath8-band amplitude of v41 becomes @xmath20.7 mag , and of v44 becomes @xmath21.2 mag .",
    "finally , the values of the `` sharp '' parameters produced by daophot are typical of stars of their brightness , indicating that the angular separations of the contaminating stars are small compared to the seeing disk .",
    "perhaps v41 and v44 are members of physical binaries with red clump stars .",
    "this would be compatible with the wide - binary hypothesis for bhb star formation discussed in  3 . in the case of v41 and v44",
    ", the mass - enhanced secondary has evolved onto the red hb , whereas for the other rrl and bhb stars , the secondary is still on the main sequence , and contributes little to the combined light ( @xmath131 mag ) .",
    "we conclude that v41 and v44 are probably rr lyrae members of ngc 6441 , but appear brighter and redder than the other cluster rrl because their photometry has been contaminated by the light of unresolved red clump companions . images with higher spatial resolution and detailed spectroscopy may confirm this conclusion ( unfortunately , v41 and v44 were just off the _ hst _ images of rich et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the light curves of `` normal '' c - type rr lyrae in clusters and the field have a characteristic shape , roughly sinusoidal , but with the region of maximum brightness skewed toward smaller phases .",
    "that is , the phase interval of `` rising light '' between minimum and maximum brightness is shortened , @xmath132 . among the 31 c - type rrl in the _ general catalog of variable stars _ ( kholopov 1985 ) with @xmath8-band photometry , @xmath133 ranges between 0.32 and 0.46 , with a mean of 0.39 and rms of 0.04 .",
    "figure 6 shows that the lc shapes of the c - type rrl in ngc 6441 depart somewhat from this norm .",
    "their maxima appear skewed to longer periods , and @xmath1340.5 .",
    "the minima may be uncharacteristically sharp as well , especially in the case of sv3 .",
    "clearly , better lcs ( more observations with smaller errors ) for more stars are required to verify this phenomenon . when the observations are confronted with stellar pulsation models ( e.g. , bono et al .",
    "1997b ) , this effect may prove to be a valuable tool for constraining the parameters responsible for bright , blue hb extensions in ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 ( e.g. , sweigart & catelan 1998 ) .",
    "the light curve shapes of the ab - type rrl in ngc 6441 appear to fall within the range of shapes exhibited by `` normal '' ab - type rrl .",
    "rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concluded that neither age nor dynamical effects , individually , could account for the extended blue hb in ngc 6441 , though they could not rule out a combination of the two .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) used synthetic hb models to explore the effects of changing parameters which may produce blue hb extensions .",
    "they concur that neither age nor enhanced rgb mass loss can produce the sloped hb , and hence luminous bhb extension , seen in ngc 6441 .",
    "they considered three additional scenarios , ( 1 ) high initial helium abundance , ( 2 ) core rotation , which at the rgb tip allows both enhanced mass loss and formation of an over - massive core , and ( 3 ) envelope helium abundance enhancement from deep mixing during the rgb phase .    in their brief report",
    ", sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) could not present detailed results of their models .",
    "we employ three means of comparing their models and @xmath37 synthetic cmds with our @xmath0 photometry : ( a ) the general distribution of stars in color and magnitude on the hb , ( b ) the number ratio of hb stars to rgb stars brighter than the mean rrl luminosity , @xmath7 , and ( c ) the pulsation characteristics of the rrl .",
    "first , we compare the overall appearance of our observed cmd with the synthetic cmds of sweigart & catelan ( 1998 , their figure 2 ) for their various scenarios .",
    "the steep slope of our red clump and its relation to the gentler - sloping bhb are best matched by the scenarios with core rotation and helium - mixing , and moderate mass loss on the rgb ( see their figures 2c and 2e ) .",
    "given the uncertainties introduced by differential reddening , foreground confusion , and by comparing the observed @xmath0 cmd with the synthetic @xmath37 cmd , we can not make a more quantitative statement at this time .",
    "measuring the @xmath7-ratio in our photometry is complicated by the high degree of contamination by stars in the foreground and by stars on the cluster asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . using as a guide a field - subtracted version of figure 11 , we defined regions in which to count the number of bhb , red clump , and red giant stars .",
    "these regions are shown in figure 11 .",
    "we counted the number of stars in each region on the unsubtracted , de - reddened cluster cmd ( figure 11 ) and the equivalent de - reddened field cmd .",
    "the counts are given in table 8 .",
    "we add nine rrl to the bhb counts and ten lpv stars to the rgb counts .",

    "systematic errors incurred by inappropriately defined counting regions are surely higher .",
    "if the counts in each region are uncertain by 25% , the systematic error on our estimate of @xmath7 is 0.66 . even with this level of uncertainty , our counts strongly disfavor the high initial helium abundance scenarios of sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) .",
    "their simulations with main sequence helium abundances of 0.38 and 0.43 produce sloping bhb extensions , but have @xmath138 and 3.9 , respectively , about 3-@xmath27 from our observed value results in overestimating @xmath7 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath141 .",
    "we caution that stellar interactions may alter the relative numbers of hb and rgb stars , and thus affect the estimate of @xmath71 .",
    "the pulsation properties of the cluster rrl stars provide other constraints on the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) models .",
    "their figure 3 shows the positions of their model bhb stars ( helium mixing scenario with intermediate mass loss ) in the temperature - period diagram .",

    "we can provide a measurement of the distribution of stars along the hb which may prove useful in constraining future synthetic hb models , and in comparing the hb of ngc 6441 with those of other globulars .",
    "the usual statistic is @xmath148 , where @xmath145 and @xmath7 are the numbers of hb stars on the blue and red sides of the instability strip , and @xmath8 is the number of rrl variables .",
    "we adopt the same cmd regions as above except that the section of the bhb region redward of @xmath149 ( the mean de - reddened mag of the rrl in table 7 , see counts in row labeled `` rhb '' of table 8) is now added to the red clump counts to produce @xmath7 . subtracting the counts in the off - cluster cmd from those in the on - cluster cmd , we obtain @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 stars , so @xmath153 ( poisson ) @xmath154 ( systematic ) .",
    "the hb is predominantly red , and only @xmath217% of hb stars are in the blue extension .",
    "it is tempting to use our photometry to measure the distance to ngc 6441 .",

    "rrl in the metal - rich globulars 47 tuc ( v9 ) and ngc 6388 ( v27 and v28 ) have similar properties .",
    "thus , a new sub - class of rrl appears to be emerging .    using the observed @xmath23 colors of the rrl at minimum light",
    ", we determined the reddening toward ngc 6441 to be @xmath156 mag .",
    "two points suggest that these long - period rrl have the same @xmath157 colors as the `` normal '' rrl , ( @xmath19 ) we obtain @xmath158 mag from the bulge variable v36 , and ( @xmath20 ) the analogous relation for @xmath159 at minimum light works for the long - period rrl v9 in 47 tuc .",
    "evidence for small changes in the amount of reddening across the face of the cluster come from the star - to - star dispersion in the rrl @xmath110 values , and from differential shifts along the reddening vector of cmds generated from small regions around the cluster .",
    "the south - east portion of the cluster has @xmath160 mag higher than the rest of the cluster , though there is evidence for patchy reddening on a scale of several arcmin or less .",
    "we employ a differentially de - reddened color - magnitude diagram to count stars in various regions along the horizontal and red giant branches .",
    "we find the ratio of hb stars to red giants to be @xmath161 , indicating a normal helium abundance of @xmath162 . about 17% of the hb stars lie blueward of the red clump , and @xmath163 , indicating a predominantly red hb .",
    "we also find that the bhb stars are more centrally concentrated than the cluster red clump stars .",
    "this could result from mass segregation if the bhb stars are members of binary systems .",
    "furthermore , the bhb stars could be _ produced _ by mass transfer in wide binary systems , as described by bailyn ( 1995 ) .",
    "the anomalously bright and red rrl v41 and v44 , which we have discovered in ngc 6441 , could represent binaries consisting of an rrl and a red clump star .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of these and the other bhb stars for binary motions would provide stronger evidence for or against the binary hypothesis of bhb star formation .",
    "we also consider a different line of hypotheses , involving variations in the physical properties of single stars , which might explain the presence of the bhb stars high surface temperatures .",
    "as noted by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) , the intrinsic slope of the hb , and in particular of the red clump , can not be reproduced by standard models invoking extreme cluster age or red giant branch mass loss .",
    "similarly , our measurement of the hb - to - giant star ratio , @xmath7 , argues strongly against the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) model predictions for a scenario which involves high initial helium abundance .",
    "in contrast , the observed periods and amplitudes of our rrl are in reasonable agreement with their model predictions for a scenario in which the helium abundance in the atmosphere has been enhanced through deep mixing on the rgb .",
    "however , the results of the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) models appear to be rather sensitive to the assumed mass loss parameters ( mean and distribution ) , which are at present poorly constrained by either observation or theory .",
    "thus , it remains unclear whether the existing observations can isolate a unique set of physical parameters which explain the production of the extended blue hb .",
    "we note one additional piece of observational evidence which may be brought to bear on this problem .",
    "the shapes of the c - type rrl light curves in ngc 6441 appear to differ significantly from their `` normal '' counterparts .",
    "they have longer phase intervals between minimum and maximum light , and the minima appear to be sharper . perhaps by adjusting the physical parameters in stellar pulsation models ( e.g. , bono et al .",
    "1997b ) , similar light curves can be produced .",
    "if so , the intersection of plausible parameters from evolution and pulsation theory could further isolate the physical differences between `` normal '' clusters and those like ngc 6441 .",
