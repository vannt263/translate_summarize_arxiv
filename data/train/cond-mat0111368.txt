    "the rich phenomenology of high-@xmath3 superconductors @xcite has stimulated strong experimental and theoretical interest in the field of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "apart from the anomalously high transition temperatures , these compounds are also of interest due to their unusual normal state properties .",
    "most of these anomalous properties are found in spectra and transport quantities , i.e.  are intimately linked to the dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , much of the experimental and theoretical effort has concentrated on the development of an understanding of the single - particle dynamics . among the fundamental and controversial questions are whether the cuprates can be described as a fermi liquid or not and what shape and volume a possible fermi surface will have .    in this connection ,",
    "one of the most informative experimental probes of the cuprates has become the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy(arpes ) .",
    "the development in this field , again largely stimulated by the interest in the physics of high-@xmath3 , has led to a tremendous increase of the angular and energy resolution @xcite .",
    "arpes is now able to access the low - energy behavior of single - particle spectra and especially the shape and topology of the cuprate fermi surface .",
    "this has lead to the discovery of the shadow bands@xcite and the pseudo - gap formation in the underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "recently , the single - particle self energy was extracted from the arpes data , showing extremely interesting behavior especially close to @xmath4 on the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "a large number of the more recent arpes experiments have concentrated on fermi surface mapping .",
    "some of these experiments seem to indicate that , at least for lsco , the fermi surface switches from being hole - like , centered at @xmath2 , for low doping to being electron - like , centered at the zone center @xmath5 for high doping with a volume consistent with the doping level@xcite . in other results , particularly for bilayer compounds like ybco or bi2212@xcite , the fermi surface seems to remain hole - like independent of the doping level . especially for those latter compounds ,",
    "further complications in the experiments arise from superstructures due to umklapp scattering and the possibility of bilayer splittings in ybco and bi2212@xcite . furthermore , in the underdoped regime one can observe additional changes in the fermi surface topology that are frequently brought in connection with the possibility of stripe formation in lsco@xcite .",
    "the presence of a large fermi surface has been taken as a validation of luttinger s theorem ; however , other results find that the fermi surface volume , at least in the underdoped regime , is too small @xcite , which would point towards a violation of luttinger s theorem .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments seem to indicate that the low doping fermi surface near @xmath6 actually bifurcates into two parts , one electron - like and one hole - like@xcite .",
    "this splitting has been interpreted in terms of strong interlayer coupling@xcite , but could equally well result from shadow fermi surface formation due to coupling of the electrons to strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations around the @xmath0 points@xcite .",
    "thus , a consistent experimental picture concerning both shape and volume of the fermi surface is at present not available and a theoretical investigation of the generic features to be expected based on a model calculation is necessary .",
    "early in the theoretical investigation of the high-@xmath3 cuprates it was realized that the 2d hubbard model @xmath7 in the intermediate coupling regime , or closely related models like the @xmath8-@xmath9 model probably capture the essential physics @xcite . in the wake of this conjecture ,",
    "a huge effort has been directed to the study of these models@xcite .",
    "there is now a general consensus that the appropriate parameter regime for the cuprates is the intermediate coupling regime where the coulomb parameter @xmath10 is roughly equal to the bandwidth .",
    "however , this is the most complicated regime of the model since both weak and strong coupling perturbative approaches fail .",
    "exact diagonalization of small clusters @xcite suffers from strong finite - size effects , often ruling out the reliable extraction of low - energy dynamics .",
    "conventional quantum monte carlo for finite sized systems suffers from a severe minus sign problem in this parameter regime .",
    "the resulting data is of insufficient quality to allow for reliable calculations of dynamic quantities at low enough temperatures .",
    "high - temperature series has provided some of the most informative results for the fermi surface topology , but it does not yield spectra , and , so far , only results for the t - j model are available@xcite .",
    "thus , also from a theoretical point of view , the question of whether a fermi surface does actually exist and what its topology is still is a matter of debate . in that connection it is of special interest that some experiments indicate a violation of luttinger s theorem ; if true , any theory , such as flex@xcite , based on a weak - coupling expansion around the non - interacting limit would be inadequate .",
    "thus a treatment within a non - perturbative scheme clearly is desirable . in this paper",
    "we therefore use the recently developed dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite to study the low - energy behavior of the @xmath1 hubbard model in the intermediate coupling regime with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath8 and on - site correlation @xmath10 equal to the band width @xmath11 .",
    "the dca systematically incorporates non - local corrections to local approximations like the dynamical mean field , by mapping the lattice onto a self - consistently embedded cluster .",
    "we solve the cluster problem using a combination of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the maximum entropy method to obtain dynamics .",
    "this technique produces results in the thermodynamic limit and has a mild minus - sign problem@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains a brief introduction to the dca .",
    "the numerical results will be presented in the third section followed by a discussion and summary .",
    "a detailed discussion of the dca formalism was already given in previous publications @xcite .",
    "the main assumption underlying the dca is that the single - particle self - energy @xmath12 is a slowly varying function of the momentum @xmath13 and can be approximated by a constant within each of a set of cells centered at a corresponding set of momenta @xmath14 in the first brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "the single - particle lattice green functions are then coarse - grained or averaged within these cells , and used to calculate the lattice self energy and other irreducible quantities . within this approximation",
    ", one can set up a self - consistency cycle similar to the one in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the dmft , where only local correlations are taken into account , the dca includes non - local dynamical correlations .",
    "the length scales of these non - local correlations can be varied systematically from short ranged to long ranged by increasing the number of coarse - graining cells .",
    "the dca collapses to the dmft if one represents the brillouin zone by one cell only , thus setting the characteristic length scale to zero .    by construction",
    ", the dca preserves the translational and point group symmetry of the lattice .",
    "comparisons to other extensions of the dmft developed during the past years@xcite either show that these are identical to the dca or converge more slowly as function of cluster size @xcite .    for the impurity problem of the dmft a large set of reliable numerical techniques has been developed over the past ten years@xcite .",
    "we have employed quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite as non - perturbative ( in @xmath10 ) methods to solve the cluster problem of the dca . for cluster sizes larger than @xmath15 however , only the qmc technique is presently available for the dca .",
    "the cluster problem is solved using the hirsch - fye impurity algorithm @xcite modified to simulate an embedded cluster@xcite .",
    "note that this problem is computationally much more difficult than that encountered in either the dmfa or in finite - sized simulations , since the block diagonal structure in space - time occurring in conventional finite - system simulations is not present here .",
    "this increase in computation time is , however , partially compensated by a rather mild minus - sign problem , even for comparatively large values of @xmath10 and small temperatures@xcite . from the qmc data ,",
    "the spectra are obtained by analytic continuation with the maximum entropy method@xcite .",
    "finally , the self energy is interpolated on to the full brillouin zone using akima splines , which is a sensible step as long as the assumption of a slow variation in @xmath16-space is valid .",
    "note that it is very important to interpolate irreducible quantities like the self energy and _ not _ for example the cluster green function itself .",
    "for @xmath17ev , @xmath18ev , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 along certain high symmetry directions ( spectra for different @xmath22 are shifted along the y - axis ) .",
    "the colored lines in figs .",

    "it is generally accepted that the tight - binding dispersion has the form @xmath25{l}\\displaystyle -2t\\left(\\cos(k_x)+\\cos(k_y)\\right)\\\\[5 mm ] \\displaystyle -4t'\\cos(k_x)\\cos(k_y ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] with a nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath26 and a next - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath27 , which in principle can have any sign . from bandstructure calculations and the general form of the measured fermi surface , especially in the overdoped regime ,",
    "conventionally a negative @xmath27 is inferred@xcite .",
    "such a negative @xmath27 would naturally lead to a fermi surface closed around the brillouin zone corner @xmath28 .",
    "the interesting question , however , is whether the fermi surface closed around the @xmath28 point observed experimentally in the low - doping region is a mere bandstructure effect or induced by correlations .",
    "weak coupling treatments of the @xmath1 hubbard model indicate that such a change of the shape , but not the volume , of the fermi surface due to the interactions is indeed possible@xcite .",
    "thus , to obtain insight into the effects of correlations on the structure of the fermi surface and distinguish them from pure bandstructure effects , we concentrate on the case @xmath29 in this paper .    in the following we set @xmath30ev in accordance with typical values extracted from the experiments and bandstructure and choose @xmath31ev .",
    "this value of @xmath10 is sufficiently large that for @xmath32 a mott gap is present in the half - filled model @xcite .",
    "we performed our simulations at a range of temperatures , but will present results for @xmath33ev only , which is roughly room temperature .",

    "we use the standard convention to identify the high symmetry points in the zone , @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 . for @xmath35",
    "the peak in the spectrum crosses the fermi energy along the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions , while for @xmath36 the second crossing appears along @xmath39 .",
    "the imaginary part of the self energy at these crossing points is plotted versus frequency in panel ( d ) of figs .",
    "[ akw_n0.95 ] and [ akw_n0.80 ] .",
    "one very interesting feature of the spectra at low doping , fig .",
    "[ akw_n0.95 ] , is that the peak near ( @xmath40 ) broadens dramatically before crossing the fermi energy .",
    "near @xmath0 , on the other hand , one does not observe any dramatic change in the spectrum when crossing the fermi energy .",
    "this indicates that near ( @xmath41 hole - like quasi - particle ( qp ) excitations with @xmath42 appear to have longer lifetimes than electronic excitations with @xmath43 . this asymmetry between particles and holes near the fermi surface is a strong indication of non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior , at least along the @xmath44-@xmath28 direction .",
    "note that this is at least qualitatively in agreement with experimental arpes spectra@xcite . although these experiments on lsco had to be performed below @xmath3 in the underdoped sample@xcite ,",
    "the authors infer from the general behavior of the spectra , that a peak crossing the fermi energy can be found along @xmath38 , while a rather broad structure is seen along @xmath37 around @xmath4",
    ". it would clearly be interesting to have experimental arpes data above @xmath3 available for a more founded comparison .",
    "it is also quite instructive to look at the imaginary part of the self - energy at the @xmath22-points where the peak in the spectrum crosses the fermi energy ( fig .  [ akw_n0.95](d ) ) .",
    "in particular at the crossing point @xmath45 close to @xmath46 , @xmath47 shows a striking asymmetry in the low - frequency regime as compared to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the crossing point close to @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , @xmath47 starts to develop an additional feature which eventually leads to the formation of a pseudo gap in the spectra along the @xmath38 direction@xcite .",
    "in addition , one observes a rather large residual scattering rate for both momenta @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this can either be taken as further evidence for nfl behavior or as signal for the occurrence of a new very small low - energy scale@xcite .",
    "obviously , we can not decide this question on the basis of the present data , but would have to look at much lower temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible at present .",
    "note that in the low - energy regime the self energy displays significant @xmath52-dependence .",
    "this clearly renders theories based on a local approximation like the dmfa inadequate at least for small doping .    at higher doping ,",
    "[ akw_n0.80 ] , the peaks in the spectrum close to the fermi energy are far sharper .",
    "here it makes sense to speak of a conventional fermi liquid and quasi particles again .",
    "as already mentioned , the fermi energy crossings can be found along @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "again , this is in qualitative accordance with arpes experiments for strongly overdoped lsco@xcite , although these experiments still find rather broad structures even in heavily overdoped samples .",
    "in addition , there is no evidence for particle - hole asymmetry in our data . especially at @xmath4 the structure crossing the fermi level appears to be rather symmetric with respect to the crossing point .",

    "all indications are that for this doping regime standard fermi - liquid behavior has returned .",

    "note also the strong bifurcation around the @xmath0 points .",
    "we find that especially for small doping @xmath57 generally predicts that the fermi surface bifurcates near @xmath0 , with parts of the fermi surface along both @xmath38 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the fact that the spectra in fig .",
    "[ akw_n0.95 ] do not show a crossing along the direction @xmath60 , only a peak coming close to the fermi energy .",

    "again , in contrast to the sharp peaks found in the spectra , @xmath61 shows a substantial broadening , which in this case can however be explained by the conventional temperature broadening of fermi s function .",

    "note also that in comparison to the @xmath57 result , no apparent electron like shadow band at @xmath46 can be seen .",
    "with increasing doping a bifurcation of the fermi surface around @xmath46 starts to develop ( see fig .",
    "[ 090_lowt_nc ] ) , signalling the incipient crossover from a hole like fermi surface to the expected electron like at large doping .",
    "in addition , around @xmath4 the peak in the spectrum follows more or less the noninteracting fermi surface again .",
    "this points towards a restoration of luttinger s theorem . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the fermi surface is definitely electron like , centered at @xmath65 , and has essentially the same volume and shape as the non - interacting surface , indicating a return to fermi - liquid like behavior .",
    "no apparent remnants of the hole - like fermi surface at lower doping are left . interpreting these bifurcations",
    "seen most strongly around @xmath63 as shadow fermi surfaces , we find a strong reduction of the weight in these shadow features both for dopings less and larger than this `` optimal '' doping .",
    "interestingly , a similar behavior was recently observed in the analysis of arpes data for bi2212@xcite .",
    "however , in these experiments the fermi surface remained hole - like throughout the whole doping regime studied . whether this might be related to a finite @xmath27 neglected in our present calculations",
    "will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the increasing precision and quality of experimental arpes spectra in recent years has led to a number of new results on the single - particle dynamics of the high-@xmath3 cuprates , both partially resolving long - standing issues and posing new questions and problems .",
    "motivated by especially the interesting observations concerning the changes of fermi surface topology with doping , we have studied the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath8 in the intermediate coupling regime ( on - site correlation @xmath10 equal to the bandwidth ) at the temperature @xmath33ev . to study the model in this most problematic parameter regime we used quantum monte carlo within the dynamical cluster approximation for the cluster size @xmath21 . since this method allows for controlled and reliable calculations of low - energy features within a non - perturbative scheme and in the thermodynamic limit , fundamental problems in this field",
    "can be addressed .",
    "these include the single - particle spectral properties at low energies , especially possible deviations from luttinger s theorem or the formation of non fermi liquid states , and the resulting topology of the fermi surface    > from the two different ways to define the fermi surface , i.e.  via @xmath61 and inspection of a constant energy scan @xmath66 the latter turned out to be the more precise .",
    "the constant energy scans are able to distinguish the situation where a peak in the spectral crosses the fermi surface from that where it only approaches it .",
    "thus they were free of spurious bifurcations observed in the @xmath61 plots . from the constant energy scans of the spectrum at the fermi energy we find that the fermi surface changes its topology compared to the non - interacting one as a function of decreasing doping .",
    "while the latter is closed around the zone center for every finite doping , the interacting fermi surface at low doping , @xmath19 , is hole - like , closed around @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the form and shifts present in the fermi surface must be taken as clear evidence for a violation of luttinger s theorem .",
    "non fermi liquid behavior is also evidenced by the spectrum .",
    "a strong particle - hole asymmetry is found at the fermi surface crossing near @xmath4 with hole - like excitations having much longer life - times than electronic excitations .",
    "furthermore the corresponding self - energy shows strong @xmath67-dependence rendering local approximations like the dmfa irrelevant .",
    "additional structures in the self energy and a rather large residual scattering rate can also be interpreted as signs for non fermi liquid behavior .",
    "however , to really distinguish a non fermi liquid from a fermi liquid with a possibly extremely small energy scale much lower temperatures must be studied .",
    "with increasing doping the fermi surface bifurcates at @xmath46 around a doping @xmath68 and from the topology around @xmath4 one can infer a tendency towards restoration of luttinger s theorem and conventional fermi liquid behavior .",
    "finally when @xmath34 the fermi surface is electron - like again , i.e. closed around the zone center , and coincides with the non - interacting fermi surface .",
    "the corresponding spectra show well defined and sharp quasi - particle peaks around the fermi energy with particle - hole symmetry being recovered in the low - energy region .",
    "although the hubbard model surely presents an oversimplification of the real cuprates , the common belief is that at least the essential qualitative features of the low energy dynamics should be reproduced . in particular",
    ", the results presented here show some interesting qualitative agreement with experiments regarding the behavior of the different structures observed in the spectra .",
    "moreover , these features could be related to at least an apparent violation of luttinger s theorem or possibly even non fermi liquid behavior at low doping . from our results",
    "it becomes very clear that neither weak - coupling treatments nor local theories like the dmft are able to capture the essentials of the physics of the cuprate in the weakly doped regime .",
    "there are , of course , a variety of further questions to be addressed .",
    "for example , most of the interesting and controversial arpes results are for the system bi2212 , which actually is a bilayer system .",
    "moreover , the simple nearest - neighbor tight binding band structure used in this paper is definitely not sufficient to describe the cuprates .",
    "thus , a detailed study about the influence of a finite and negative @xmath27 and also a bilayer coupling on the topology of the fermi surface or more generally on the low - energy single particle dynamics is definitely necessary .",
    "we believe that such an investigation can also address some of the still mysterious features in behavior of the fermi surface topology of the high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "moreover it is very important to find new methods to solve the dca self consistency cycle at lower temperatures or preferably at @xmath69 .",
    "this would enable us to clearly distinguish between a strong coupling fermi liquid and genuine non fermi liquid behavior at low doping .",

    "<S> we find a crossover from a normal fermi liquid with a fermi surface closed around the brillouin zone center at large doping to a non - fermi liquid for small doping . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover is signalled by a splitting of the fermi surface around the @xmath0 point of the @xmath1 brillouin zone , which eventually leads to a hole - like fermi surface closed around the point @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the fermi surface at low doping indicates a violation of luttinger s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss different ways of presenting the spectral data to extract information about the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to recent experiments will be presented . </S>"
