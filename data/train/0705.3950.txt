    "the nucleon and nucleon resonances have no strangeness contents , whereas the @xmath0 meson is an ideally mixed pure @xmath12 state . from the point of view of the naive quark model",
    "the @xmath13 reaction involves disconnected quark lines and is an okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule  @xcite suppressed process .",
    "the study of @xmath0 meson production in nucleon - nucleon reactions may provide information on the strangeness degrees of freedom in the nucleon or nucleon resonances and is of importance both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "several years ago , the exclusive production cross section for @xmath0 meson production in @xmath14 collisions at p@xmath15 = 3.67 gev / c was measured by the disto collaboration  @xcite , and the preliminary result at an excess energy of 18.5 mev above the threshold was also published by the anke group  @xcite . with these experimental information about this reaction , several theoretical papers  @xcite by using various models were published to try to explain the experimental data .",
    "recently , more data at other energies are available from the anke facility  @xcite . comparing the data for the @xmath16 meson production from literature , a significant enhancement of @xmath17 ratio of a factor 8",
    "is found compared to predictions based on the ozi rule .",

    "<S> the significant coupling of the @xmath3 resonance to @xmath11 is compatible with previous indications of a large @xmath12 component in the quark wave function of the @xmath3 resonance and may be the real origin of the significant enhancement of the @xmath0 production over the naive ozi - rule predictions . </S>"
