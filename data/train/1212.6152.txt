    "by the modularity theorem @xcite , an elliptic curve @xmath1 over @xmath0 admits a modular parametrization @xmath2 for some integer @xmath3 . if @xmath3 is the smallest such integer , then it is equal to the conductor of @xmath1 and the pullback of the nron differential of @xmath1 under @xmath4 is a rational multiple of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a newform with rational fourier coefficients .",
    "the fact that the @xmath7-function of @xmath8 coincides with the hasse - weil zeta function of @xmath1 ( which follows from eichler - shimura theory ) is central to the proof of fermat s last theorem , and is related to the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",
    "in addition to this , modular parametrization is used for constructing rational points on elliptic curves , and appears in the gross - zagier formula @xcite .    in this paper , we study some general properties of @xmath4 , and as a consequences we explain and generalize the results of kaneko and sakai from @xcite .",
    "kaneko and sakai ( inspired by the paper of guerzhoy @xcite ) observed that certain elliptic curves whose associated newforms ( by the modularity theorem ) are given by the eta - quotients from the list of martin and ono @xcite can be characterized by a particular differential equation involving holomorphic modular forms .    to give an example of this phenomena , let @xmath9 be a unique newform of weight @xmath10 on @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the dedekind eta function @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and put @xmath15 .",
    "then an eisenstein series @xmath16 on @xmath17 associated either to cusp @xmath18 or to cusp @xmath19 is a solution of the following differential equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a ramanujan - serre differential operator . throughout the paper ,",

    "this differential equation defines a parametrization of an elliptic curve @xmath24 by modular functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the newform associated to @xmath1 .",
    "one finds that @xmath27 , so curiously the modular forms @xmath28 and @xmath29 appearing in this parametrization are modular for @xmath30 , although the conductor of @xmath1 is @xmath31 .    using the eichler - shimura theory , we generalize to the arbitrary elliptic curve @xmath1 of conductor @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , which admits a modular parametrization @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the modular curve @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a newform with rational fourier coefficients associated to @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from the modularity theorem that in any @xmath0-isomorphism class of elliptic curves there is an elliptic curve @xmath1 admitting such parametrization ( note that for @xmath40 the change of variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 implies @xmath43 .    to such @xmath44",
