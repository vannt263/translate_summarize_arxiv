    "discrete solitons and more specifically kink - like topological excitations are ubiquitous structures that arise in numerous physical applications ranging from dislocations or ferroelectric domain walls in solids , to bubbles in dna , or magnetic chains and josephson junctions , among others ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent exposition of relevant applications ) .",
    "the mobility of such lattice kinks is one of the key issues in many of these applications , especially since the pioneering works of @xcite which illustrated that the kinematics on the lattice is dramatically different from the continuum analog of such equations where constant speed propagation is typical . instead ,",
    "on the discrete substrate , kinks need to overcome the , so - called , peierls - nabarro potential ( pnp ) , constantly radiating their energy and being eventually trapped by the lattice .",
    "the _ static _",
    "pnp refers to the energy difference between a stable inter - site centered discrete kink and an unstable , onsite centered discrete kink .",
    "clearly , as a kink is travelling from one site to the next , it `` wobbles '' over this potential energy landscape @xcite .",
    "however , even though clearly travelling is intimately connected with overcoming the static pnp without `` radiating '' energy @xcite , this connection is relatively subtle and the inter - dependence of these two features ( static pnp and travelling ) still remains elusive @xcite .",
    "typically , discrete kinks traveling with finite velocity have only been obtained for a discrete set of velocities @xcite which makes the motion unstable with respect to perturbations .",
    "there exists a class of more exotic exact solutions ( the so - called `` nanoptera '' ) where the kink propagates together with a plane wave having the same velocity @xcite .",
    "while the travelling problem is extremely interesting in its own right , in the present work , we will start by examining the construction of discrete models with pnp - free kinks , using a simplified ( quasi)static approach .",
    "two classes of discrete models where static kink can be placed anywhere with respect to the lattice have been previously derived : one conserving energy @xcite and another one conserving momentum @xcite . in both cases",
    "the static kink solution can be obtained from a two - body nonlinear map . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that , in general , a discrete version of the first integral of the static continuum klein - gordon field plays the role of this nonlinear map .",
    "thus we derive a wide class of such models including the two above - mentioned classes as special cases .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the kinks are no longer ( typically ) trapped by the lattice .",
    "instead they can be accelerated by even weak external fields .",
    "however , a note of caution should be added here .",
    "while one might naively expect that such solutions would be intimately connected with slow travelling , it has been demonstrated numerically that travelling solutions ( when they can be found as e.g. in @xcite for klein - gordon lattices , using the methods of @xcite ) have a sharp lower bound in their wave speed @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a threshold illustrates the fact that one should be particularly careful in trying to infer features of the travelling problem from such `` static '' considerations . on the other hand ,",
    "as the recent work of barashenkov , oxtoby and pelinovsky demonstrates @xcite , discretizations without pnp are much more natural candidates for possessing travelling solutions for a isolated wave speeds ( not close to zero ) .",
    "the presentation of our results will be structured as follows .",
    "section ii will contain the setup and notations used for the klein - gordon models .",
    "section iii will present the general methodology for obtaining static pnp - free discretizations .",
    "section iv will illustrate the connection to previously reported models .",
    "section v will focus on the special case example of the @xmath0 model , for which our numerical observations will be presented in section vi .",
    "finally in section vii , we will summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the lagrangian of the klein - gordon field , @xmath1dx\\ , , \\label{kleingordonham}\\ ] ] and the corresponding equation of motion , @xmath2    topological solitons ( kinks ) are possible only if @xmath3 has at least two minima @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the stationary solutions to eq .",
    "( [ kleingordon ] ) .",
    "we will study the properties of kinks that interpolate between these two stationary solutions .",
    "our considerations allow one to treat the cases when other minima appear in between the two minima , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , connected by the kink .",
    "equation ( [ kleingordon ] ) will be discretized on the lattice @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the lattice spacing .    for brevity ,",
    "when possible , we will use the notations @xmath13    we would like to construct a nearest - neighbor discrete analog to eq .",
    "( [ kleingordon ] ) of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a parameter related to the lattice spacing @xmath12 as @xmath16 , such that in the continuum limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "note that in this context , the `` standard '' discretization emerges in the form : @xmath19 .",
    "generalizations of this model will be discussed in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 has @xmath22 as the continuum limit .",
    "we will characterize a model as pnp - free if a _",
    "static _ kink can be placed anywhere with respect to the lattice ( continuum , rather than discrete , set of equilibrium solutions ) .",
    "this is equivalent to demanding that the kink must have an neutral direction , or ( from noether s theory @xcite ) a goldstone translational mode .",
    "it is natural to categorize this definition of pnp - free model as `` static '' or `` quasi - static '' , in the sense that it does not involve the kinematic or dynamical properties of the model .    on the other hand",
    ", one can demand the absence of pnp at finite kink velocities .",
    "this can be transformed to the demand that the discrete model supports the exact traveling wave solutions and this demand can be called `` dynamic '' definition ; see e.g. @xcite for such travelling wave examples , where the `` static '' definition of the pnp clearly fails .    in this paper",
    "we aim to construct the models pnp - free in the static sense as a first ( yet nontrivial ) step towards understanding the nature of the discrete travelling problem ( see also the comments above ) .",
    "we will also focus on the existence of physically motivated conserved quantities for the derived models .",
    "hamiltonian models are energy - conserving models and the models with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 will be called momentum - conserving models . as was shown in @xcite , the discrete model of eq .",
    "( [ kleingordondiscrete ] ) conserves the momentum of eq .

    "our aim here will be to discretize eq .",
    "( [ kleingordon ] ) in a symmetric way , so that the static kink solution can be found from a reduced first - order difference equation . according to @xcite , if we achieve that , then we are going to have a one - parameter family of solutions with the possibility to place equilibrium kinks anywhere with respect to the lattice ( and hence , pnp - free in the static sense ) .",
    "the first integral of the steady state problem in eq .",
    "( [ kleingordon ] ) , @xmath28 ( with zero integration constant ) , can be written in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a continuous function .",
    "our plan will then be the following :    * discretize the first - order differential equation of eq .",
    "( [ staticfirstintegral2 ] ) using a first order difference scheme @xmath31 . * then express the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ kleingordon ] ) as a sum of terms containing derivatives , e.g. , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc . * as a result , discretizations of such terms , e.g. , @xmath34 $ ] , vanish for @xmath31 ( or otherwise stated : the construction of the equilibrium solution is converted to a first order difference problem ) .",
    "then , the static kink ( pnp - free , by construction ) solutions for the obtained discrete model can be found from this two - site problem .    in the following",
    ", we will consider a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ staticfirstintegral2 ] ) with @xmath35 , for which we introduce the notation @xmath36 and the following two - site discrete analog @xmath37 we will also use the shorthand notations , @xmath38    we have assumed that the klein - gordon field supports kink solutions .",
