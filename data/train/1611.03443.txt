    "the interaction between the two subsystems is given by a completely positive probability - preserving quantum dynamical map .",
    "our model coincides with that proposed by caban _",

    "we will demonstrate that the new quantitative complementarity relation ( [ eq : fidelity_compl ] ) also accounts for the complementarity between strangeness oscillations and lifetime information considered by bgh .",
    "the results allow us to visualize and discuss in a clear way through the @xmath3@xmath4 oscillations the essential role played by entanglement in wave - particle duality .",
    "while there are several open quantum system models available in the literature offering completely - positive , probability preserving descriptions of the composite neutral kaon plus weak decay products system @xcite , here we consider a model in which these two subsystems are treated as different parties .",
