    "secondly , our approach is _ algorithmic _  the moment recursion can finally be deduced from a straightforward calculation , by the method of dominant balance .",
    "our approach also allows to obtain corrections to the asymptotic behaviour , which can not ( easily ) be deduced by other methods .",
    "thirdly , the approach is _ flexible _  it may be applied to other classes to obtain a universal limit distribution , which only depends on the singularity structure of the functional equation .",
    "our generating function approach is particularly suited for counting parameters , which decompose linearly under the cartesian product construction .",
    "examples of such models with a rational generating function appear in @xcite .",
    "examples with an inverse square root appear in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the discrete counterparts of brownian motion , brownian bridges , and brownian meanders can be studied , see @xcite .",
    "also , universality questions for parameters related to left and right path lengths in trees @xcite can be studied by our methods , compare the discussion in @xcite .    within the framework of simply generated trees , an alternative derivation of the above moment recursion",
    "could be obtained with the techniques of @xcite , where the different problem of the ( generalised ) wiener index of trees was analysed .",
    "it would be interesting to consider how our methods can be adapted to this problem .",
