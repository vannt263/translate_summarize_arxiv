    "the dark matter ( dm ) component of gravitational structures is extensively studied from the dynamical analysis of the luminous component .",
    "popular examples are the rotation curves of galaxies , motions of galaxies in groups or in clusters , or large scale velocity fields from which the mass and the distribution of the dm can be inferred , provided one assumes a dynamical state ( virial state ) and a geometry ( sphericity ) of the gravitational system .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases these hypothese are not fulfilled : for example , the virial hypothesis applied to clusters may be wrong , because clusters may be young gravitational objects .",
    "their mass profile could be alternatively obtained from the x - ray bremsstralung emission of their intra - cluster gas which depends on their total mass distribution and their equilibrium state as well .",
    "again , one has to assume a geometry and a thermodynamical state for the gas of photons and electrons . despite these difficulties , all these studies provide similar trends , with the mass to light",
    "ratio m / l increasing with scale . for a typical",
    "galaxy m / l ranges between @xmath3 , but is roughly @xmath4 times larger for a cluster from both virial and x - ray studies , leading to @xmath5 for the former and @xmath6 for the later .",
    "this means that the mass can not be concentrated only within the central visible parts of galaxies .",
    "gravitational lensing provides a direct measurement of the projected mass density without additional hypothesis on the dynamical state or on the geometry of the mass distribution .",
    "provided that we can measure the optical distortion of background objects caused by a foreground mass , it is possible to constrain the projected mass distribution of this deflector .",
    "recent results of the lensing analysis on some clusters are summerized in table ( 1 )",
    ".    0.5 cm    table  1 : status of the observations .",
    "these results are larger than the usual virial or x - ray analysis by a factor 2 or 3 . whether this discrepancy may be explained or not is not clear yet ( miralda - escud & babul ( 1995 ) , navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) , and we do not discuss this here .",
    "we discuss in this paper the general method of the weak lensing analysis leading to these results .",

    "the gravitational distortion is not visible on a single galaxy in the weak lensing regime because @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mean ellipticity of the galaxies .",
    "fortunately a gravitational shear in a given area of the sky distorts all the background galaxies by a same amount , and the distortion can be measured from the mean polarization of these galaxies . the distortion @xmath28 is computed from the shape of the galaxies in the image plane .",
    "each galaxy is assumed to be elliptical with an ellipticity @xmath29 and an orientation @xmath30 , and is described by a polarization vector @xmath31 in a complex formalism .",
    "the distortion is given by the sum of the polarization vectors in a given area of the sky .",
    "no information is required in the source plane , only the isotropy of the orientation of the galaxies in the source plane is assumed .",
    "a detailled description on the optimum detection and measurement of the shape of the galaxies is given in bonnet & mellier ( 1995 ) and kaiser et al .",
    "this method has been succesfully applied to several clusters ( see table(1 ) ) , and to simulations to get the distortion . however , the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies is a source of noise , and the contribution of the random orientations of @xmath32 galaxies to the value of the shear @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "an estimate of the mass using eq .",
    "( 10 ) requires an estimation of @xmath16 , which implies the redshift of the sources which is poorly known . though this is not a critical issue for nearby clusters ( @xmath35 ) because @xmath36 , it could lead to a large uncertainty of the mass for more distant clusters ( see table ( 1 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to get a true value for the mass only from the shear map , even if we know the redshift of the sources , because a constant mass plane does not induce any shear on background galaxies .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the unknown intregration constant @xmath25 in eq.(10 ) .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken if one measures the magnification @xmath19 which depends on the mass quantity inside the light beam ( eq.(3 ) ) . while the shear measurement does not require any information in the source plane",
    ", the magnification measurement needs the observation of a reference ( unlensed ) field to calibrate the magnification .",
    "broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 proposed to compare the number count @xmath37 and/or @xmath38 in a lensed and an unlensed field to measure @xmath19 .",
    "depending on the value of the slope @xmath39 of the number count in the reference field , we observe a bias ( more objects ) or an anti - bias ( less objects ) in the lensed field .",
    "the particular value @xmath40 corresponds to the case where the magnification of faint objects is exactely compensated by the dilution of the number count .",
    "this method was applied successfully on the cluster a1689 ( broadhurst , 1995 ) , but the signal to noise of the detection remains 5 times lower than with the distortion method for a given number of galaxies .",
    "the magnification may also be determined by the changes of the image sizes at fixed surface brightness ( bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) .",
    "the weakness of these methods is that they require to measure the shape , size and magnitude of very faint objects up to b=28 , and this is not sure whether the measurement is optimum , and whether systematic effects are avoided .",
    "the determination of the shape parameter depends on the threshold level and the convolution mask , and in any cases the information contained in pixels fainter than the threshold level is lost . furthermore , the measurement of the shape from the second moment matrix is equivalent to the assumption that the objects are elliptical , which is not true .",
    "these remarks lead us to propose a new and independent method to analyse the lensing effects , based on the auto - correlation function of the pixels in ccd images , which avoids shape parameter measurements ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "the ccd image is viewed as a density field rather than an image containing delimited objects . the surface brightness in the image plane in the direction @xmath41",
    "is related to the surface brightness in the source plane @xmath42 by the relation :    i()=i^(s)(a )    and for the auto - correlation function ( acf ) :    ( ) = ^(s)(a )    to understand the meaning of this equation , let us write it in the weak lensing regime :    ( ) = ^(s)()-  _ ^(s ) ( ) [ 1-a ]    @xmath43 is the sum of an isotropic unlensed term @xmath44 , an isotropic lens term which depends on @xmath12 , and an anisotropic term which depends on @xmath33 .    let us analyse which gravitational lensing information can be extracted from the shape matrix @xmath45 of @xmath46 :    _ ij = d^2 ( ) _ i _ jd^2 ( )    the shape matrix in the image plane is simply related to the shape matrix in the source plane @xmath47 by @xmath48 . if the galaxies are isotropically distributed in the source plane , @xmath49 is isotropic , and in that case @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the identity matrix . using the expression of the amplification matrix",
    "@xmath11 we get the general form for @xmath45 :    = m(a+|g|^2)(1-)^2(1-|g|^2 )    the observable quantities ( distortion @xmath28 and magnification @xmath19 ) are given in terms of the components of the shape matrix :    _ 1=m_11-m_22trm  ;  _",
    "2=2m_12trm  ;  =    where @xmath52 is the trace of @xmath45 .",
    "as for lensed galaxies , we see that the distortion is available from a direct measurement in the image plane while the magnification measurement requires to know the value of @xmath53 which is related to the light distribution in the source plane , or in an unlensed reference plane .",
    "the acf provides a new and independent way to measure @xmath28 and @xmath19 which does not require shape , size or photometry of individual galaxies . in the following",
    "we only describe the measurement of the distortion using this method .",
    "the case of the magnification which requires an analysis of the sources galaxies in a reference field , will be developped in a future work .      by definition , the value of the acf at a pixel position @xmath54 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the value of the pixel @xmath57",
    ", @xmath58 is the mean value of the image , and @xmath59 the number of terms in the sum .",
    "the acf is computed in a part of the image ( a superpixel ) where the shear is assumed to be constant in intensity and direction .",
    "two strategies are possible to compute the acf .",
    "first we can remove all the unwanted objects ( stars , bright galaxies , dead ccd lines , cosmetic defaults , ... ) and compute the acf from the rest of the image .",
    "the main interest of this approach is that it works at the noise level and even ultra faint objects are taken into account .",
    "the second approach consists in selecting objects from a given criteria ( magnitude , colors , redshift , ... ) , in surrounding them by a large circle , put the rest of the image to zero and compute the acf of the image containing these circles .    as for the case of individual galaxy",
    "we need to compute the shape matrix of the acf in an annular filter ( bonnet & mellier , 1995 ) to avoid the center , where the signal is strongly polluted by the point spread function ( psf ) , and the external part , which is dominated by the noise .",
    "the effects of the psf and the filter are calibrated by using simulations .",
    "the galaxies have not the same flux , size and profile and , by definition of the acf , are weighted by the square of their flux .",
    "since this could change the statistical properties of the acf , it is better to work with selected objects by using the second strategy of the acf method .",
    "the idea is to weight each circle which contains an object by a multiplicative term defined as @xmath60^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath59 is the number of pixels of the object .",
    "the objects are then equally weighted , even when they have very different magnitudes , sizes and profiles .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies induces a statistical dispersion on the shear estimate of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean ellipticity of @xmath32 galaxies .",
    "instrumental errors , tracking errors or anisotropic psf may be removed provided they are measurable on the stellar profiles ( bonnet & mellier 1995 , kaiser et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the photon noise is a source of error of this method .",
    "indeed , the distortion is computed from one object , the acf itself .",
    "since the noise polarizes randomly an object , a high noise level makes the measurement of the weak distortion impossible .",
    "this lead to the conclusion that a given level of noise corresponds to a distortion threshold @xmath63 below which the measured distortion is not reliable .",
    "we quantified this threshold from simulations .",
    "an optimum analysis of the lensing effects requires the measurement of both the distortion and the magnification to comfirm and improve the results quoted in table ( 1 ) , and to measure the very weak shear caused by large scale structures .",
    "van waerkebe et al . (",
    "1996 ) have proposed a new and independent method to measure the gravitational distortion of the background galaxies from the auto - correlation function of the brightness distribution .",
    "it does not require any shape , size and centroid determination of individual galaxies , and avoids possible systematics .",
    "moreover the resulting shear is unique and does not depends on the choice of the detection criteria .",
    "the method has been checked on simulated and true data ( q2345 and cl0024 ) .",
    "an example of the shear analysis using the acf on simulated data is shown on figures 1,2 .",
    "the shear maps of the real images q2345 and cl0024 were previously obtained by bonnet et al .",
    "( 1993,1994 ) with the standard method of individual galaxy analysis .",
    "our results are in very good agreement . moreover , because of the increase of the sensibility with our method , we predict the existence of a new gravitational deflector in the field of q2345 .",
    "further observations will check this point .",
    "because of its simplicity and robustness , this method is well adapted to measure weak shear caused by large scale structure for which a large number of galaxies ( @xmath64 ) is required .",
