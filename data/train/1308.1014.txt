    "magnetic materials are among the oldest systems that have been studied by physicists @xcite .",
    "the interest to magnetic systems is connected with their special properties .",
    "also the application of magnetic materials in modern technology put the study of such systems to the one of the main aims of modern condensed matter physics . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical models , which originally were developed to describe magnetic properties of matter , like the famous ising model , are often used in other fields of theoretical and experimental physics .",
    "the opposite is also true : many approaches of modern physics are successfully used in the theory and experiment of magnetism .",
    "one of the advantages of the theory of magnetism , is the well - developed during years conceptual approach there @xcite .",
    "for example , at the classical level , maxwell s electrodynamics has successfully described the main features of the response of magnetic materials to the external electric and magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum nature of magnetism manifests itself , e.g. , in properties of non - interacting with each other magnetic ions in paramagnets .",
    "schottky anomalies in the behavior of magnetic contribution to the specific heat are the prime example of the quantum nature of ( para)magnetic ions due to the crystalline electric field of ligands .",
    "the theory of such paramagnets is well - developed @xcite . in general , we know how interactions between magnetic ions change their properties ( starting with present in any magnetic system magnetic dipole - dipole interactions , short - range exchange interactions @xcite , which mostly define magnetic ordering , and long - range magnetic interactions in metals @xcite , which can often be the reason for inhomogeneity in magnetic structures ) .    for standard many - body magnets we know how to take into account interactions .",
    "as a rule we successfully use the mean - field - like theory @xcite , or at low temperatures , the spin wave approximation @xcite .",
    "such theories can be used without principal difficulties for systems , in which we can well determine the ground state , i.e. , the optimal state with the minimal energy , like in ferromagnets or two - sublattice antiferromagnets @xcite . however , if the situation with inter - ionic magnetic interactions becomes more complicated than in standard bipartite magnetic systems , where the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions can be satisfied for each pair of magnetic particles , like in the square lattice ising antiferromagnet , see fig .",
    "[ afis ] , standard mean field and spin wave methods can not be applied successfully , and we need different approaches .        in bipartite lattices we can divide the total system in two subsystems so that particles , belonging to the first subsystem , are nearest neighbors to particles , belonging to the other subsystem . if the interaction is between only nearest neighbors , pair antiferromagnetic bonds have minimal energies and the global optimal state of the system can be realized by minimizing coupling energies for each pair .",
    "however , there exist many lattices , which we can not divide into two sublattices . for such systems we have a problem with the use of mean - field - like approximation or spin wave theory :",
    "the optimal state with the minimal energy is either not determined there , or there are many such states ( too many , their number is of order of number of magnetic particles in the system ) , so that we can not realize the knowledge of the ground state .",
    "the simple example is the triangular two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the elementary cell of the triangular lattice is a triangle .",
    "another example of such a lattice is the so - called kagome lattice , known due to traditional japanese bamboo baskets .",
    "it is composed of the arrangement of interlaced triangles , which are organized so that each point where two laths cross has four neighboring pattern of a tri - hexagonal tiling .",
    "the elementary cell of the kagome lattice is the star of david .",
    "notice that the crossing points of the kagome lattice do not form a mathematical lattice , unlike the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "it has the symmetry p6 m ( or p3m1 ) , like the triangular lattice .",
    "we can see that antiferromagnetic nearest - neighboring couplings can not minimize the total energy of such a system .",
    "hence , the standard approach , which brought so much success in studies of bipartite ( antiferro)magnetic systems , fails for such lattices .",
    "such magnetic systems are known nowadays as magnetically frustrated ones . in many magnetically frustrated systems magnetic ions",
    "do not develop long - range magnetic ordering for the reasons , which will be explained below . in that sense",
    "frustrated magnetic systems belong to the class of `` spin - liquids '' @xcite .",
    "the quantum spin liquid state is disordered , like in liquids , comparing to magnetically long - range ordered states .",
    "however , unlike other disordered states , a spin liquid state can be preserved down to very low temperatures ( comparing to the values of spin - spin interactions ) . the interest to magnetically frustrated systems",
    "is caused not only by their interesting physical properties ; such materials are perspective from the point of view of their use as data storage and memory , or as possible realization of topological quantum computation .",
    "we call the system as frustrated if it can not minimize its total energy ( the macroscopic state ) by minimizing the interaction between each pair involved into the interaction , i.e. , to perform such a minimization pair by pair @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is often used to call the system frustrated if its ground state is highly degenerate , and the level of degeneracy is of order of the number of particles in the system .",
    "magnetic systems are the most known example of the manifestation of frustration .",
    "however , naturally , the phenomenon of frustration is not limited to magnetic systems .",
    "for example , among frustrated systems we can count liquid and molecular crystals ( like solid n@xmath0 ) , arrays of josephson junctions , as well as the so - called `` nuclear pasta state '' of spatially modulated nuclear density inside stars ( caused by the competition between coulomb interactions and short - range nuclear couplings ) .",
    "it is usual to distinguish between random and geometrical frustrations .",
    "let us , first , discuss in short the former , because our review is mainly devoted to the latter . the random frustration , in turn ,",
    "can be divided into dynamical and quenched one , by the origin .",
    "the characteristic feature of the dynamical ( annealed ) random frustration is related to multiple length scales , which are developed in time for spatially inhomogeneous systems with competing interactions . if such dynamical processes are frozen out , the randomness , and , in turn , frustration , is quenched . to remind , in statistical physics we usually call some parameters as quenched when they are random variables which do not evolve in time .",
    "quenched frustration appears in systems , in which frozen degrees of freedom are not homogeneous , e.g. , they can not be periodically translated .",
    "such a phenomenon can be observed in many metallic alloys with magnetic ingredients , which interact with each other via the long - range sign - changing rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) coupling @xcite .",
    "the main example of the manifestation of the random frustration in magnetic systems is a spin glass @xcite , i.e. , an ordered magnet with stochastic positions of spins with competing possible ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions between them , see the example in fig .",
    "[ spinglass ] .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization of spin glasses is zero , however the magnetic ordering exists in the form of long - ranged spin - spin correlations .    in this review",
    "we will mostly deal with the geometric frustration . here",
    "particles sit on the sites of regular lattices , unlike the situation with random frustration .",
    "however , local pair particle - particle interactions are in a conflict with each other : each bond favors its own spatial correlation .",
    "then it is impossible to satisfy all local interactions .",
    "the most known example is related to ising spins 1/2 ( which can be directed only up and down ) ; they interact antiferromagnetically only with nearest neighbors on a two - dimensional equilateral triangular lattice . clearly",
    ", antiferromagnetic bonds tend each neighboring spins to be antiparallel to each other , but it is impossible to realize , hence frustration .",
    "an example of the elementary cell of such a system is presented in fig .",
    "[ tri ] .",
    "geometrical frustration is possible not only if spins are collinear , but for spins arranged non - collinearly .",
    "geometrically frustrated systems often manifest a residual entropy .",
    "the residual entropy , by definition , is the amount of entropy present even if the system is cooled arbitrary close to zero temperature .",
    "it exists for systems , in which many different microscopic states can persist when cooled to zero temperature , e.g. , if the system has many different ground states with the same energy : degenerate ground states .",
    "such a situation can also exist if such states have slightly different energies , but the system is prevented from settling in the `` real '' ground state with the lowest energy .",
    "the latter can be realized , e.g. , if the system is very swiftly cooled .",
    "the most known example for systems possessing residual entropy is any amorphous system , like a glass .",
    "there the reason for residual entropy is caused in a great number of different ways of realization of microscopic structures in a macroscopic system .",
    "the interesting property of geometrically frustrated magnetic systems , like spin ice ( see below ) is that the level of residual entropy can be controlled by the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "this property of geometrically frustrated magnetic systems can be used for creation of refrigeration systems .",
    "in fact , geometrically frustrated magnetic systems had been studied earlier than the term `` frustration '' has been used @xcite . for the review on frustrated spin systems ,",
    "consult , e.g. , the interesting books @xcite .",
    "perhaps , it is worthwhile to discuss here the convenient measure of the level of frustration in geometrically or randomly frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "so - called frustration index @xmath1 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is determined as @xmath2 is the ( critical ) temperature at which the magnetic system possesses the long range order ( say , the nel temperature for antiferromagnets , or freezing temperature for spin glasses ) .",
    "clearly , for magnetically disordered frustrated spin systems we would have @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the most of real magnetic systems spin - spin interactions ( for example , magnetic dipole - dipole interactions , which are present in any magnetic system ) should develop magnetic ordering , though at very low temperatures .",
    "geometrically frustrated magnetic systems have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "probably , the oldest example of the geometrically frustrated system is the usual water ice .",
    "it is well known that the molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms connected with the help of a covalent bond to the oxygen atom .",
    "water ice is the frozen water , i.e. , it is the water in the solid state .",
    "depending on the external temperature and pressure water molecules in ( water ) ice can be organized in different forms . at ambient pressure",
    "the water ice can exist in three common forms : the ice i@xmath4 , or the hexagonal ice , which possesses the hexagonal symmetry , the most common phase of the water ice ; the ice i@xmath5 , or the cubic ice , in which the cubic symmetry persists , and the ice xi with the orthorhombic symmetry ( the space group cmc2@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "the ice i@xmath5 or sphalerite , is the metastable phase existing , as a rule , between 130  k and 220  k , in which oxygen atoms organize a cubic diamond structure @xcite .",
    "the ice xi is the proton ( hydrogen)-ordered low - temperature ( below 72  k ) form of the hexagonal ice .",
    "it contains eight water molecules per unit cell .",
    "the internal energy of the ice xi is about 0.17 times lower than the one for the hexagonal ice i@xmath4 .",
    "it is a ferroelectric , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the hexagonal ice , also known as ice one , or wurzite , is the water ice , which properties permitted to give the name to spin ices .",
    "it is stable down to approximately 73  k. its symmetry is hexagonal with nearly tetrahedral bonding angles ( @xmath7 ) of the crystal structure . the latter consists of crinkled ( alternating in the abab pattern ) planes composed of tessellating hexagonal rings ( a repetition of rings without gaps and overlaps , like in escher s pictures ) .",
    "b planes are reflections of a planes along the same axes as the planes themselves .",
    "oxygen sits in each vertex , and edges of rings are formed by hydrogen bonds @xcite .",
    "two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them . in a liquid water more",
    "bonds are possible because oxygen of a single water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons , each can form a hydrogen bond with another molecule with the angle between hydrogen atoms 104.45@xmath8 and with the distance from hydrogen to oxygen being 95.84  pm .",
    "the side with oxygen atom in the water molecule has a partial negative charge due to higher electronegativity of the oxygen comparing to hydrogen .",
    "it means that the hydrogen side is partially positive , i.e. , the water molecule is a dipole .",
    "the charge difference yields attraction between water molecules , which contributes to the hydrogen bonding .",
    "every water molecule has hydrogen bonds with up to four other water molecules , because it can accept two and donate two hydrogens , see fig .",
    "[ ihice ] .",
    "the hydrogen bonding energy of the water molecule is relatively strong ( it is weak , though , comparing to covalent bonds within the water molecule ) .",
    "hydrogen bonds with almost tetrahedral bonding angles of the water molecule , cf .",
    "[ ihice ] , help to organize an open hexagonal lattice of the hexagonal ice .",
    "the distance between oxygen atoms along each bond is about 275  pm , which is much larger than the distance between oxygen and hydrogen in the water molecule .",
    "large hexagonal rings leave almost enough room for another water molecule to exist inside , which yields the density of ice being lower than of the water .",
    "hydrogen atoms ( in fact , almost protons ) sit very close along hydrogen bonds in the crystal lattice of the hexagonal ice ( fig .",
    "[ ihice ] ) , i.e. , each water molecule is preserved there .",
    "it implies that in the hexagonal ice each oxygen has two adjacent hydrogens at about 101  pm ( along the 275  pm hydrogen bond ) , i.e. , not in the middle of the distance between two oxygens .",
    "basically , two equivalent hydrogen positions exist in each oxygen - oxygen bond .",
    "four - fold oxygen coordination yields one hydrogen per such a bond . in the structure of the hexagonal water ice that way",
    "is determined by the bernal - fowler ice rules @xcite .",
    "the first one is related to one hydrogen per oxygen - oxygen bond in average in the ice crystal .",
    "the second ice rule states that for each oxygen two hydrogens have to be close , and two protons sit far from the oxygen .",
    "it turns out that the second ice rule frustrates the low - energy problem of the water ice caused by the stability of water molecules in it . as a result",
    ", the crystal structure contains the residual ( zero temperature ) entropy inherent to the lattice . in other words ,",
    "the hexagonal ice is expected to have the intrinsic randomness even if it was possible to cool it to zero temperature .",
    "in ideal situation the hexagonal ( water ) ice can never be completely frozen , seemingly violating the third law of thermodynamics !",
    "such an entropy in the hexagonal water ice is defined by the number of possible configurations of hydrogen positions which can be formed ( the requirement of two hydrogens to be related to each oxygen in the closest proximity with each hydrogen bond , which join two oxygen atoms having only one hydrogen , holds ) .",
    "the residual entropy of the hexagonal ice is @xmath9  j  mol@xmath10  k@xmath10 . that value has been measured in the set of experiments devoted to the investigation of the specific heat of the hexagonal water ice @xcite .",
    "the structure of the hexagonal ice has been pioneered by linus pauling [ the only person who was awarded by two unshared nobel prizes : chemistry ( 1954 ) and peace ( 1962 ) prizes ] in 1935 @xcite .",
    "he has noticed that the number of configurations with two hydrogen being close to the oxygen , and two hydrogens being far from it grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "it implies the extensive character of the residual entropy of the hexagonal water ice .",
    "pauling has estimated the value of the residual entropy in the hexagonal water ice .",
    "one mole of ice contain @xmath11 oxygens , and therefore @xmath12 oxygen - oxygen bonds .",
    "each such a bond can have two possible positions for a hydrogen , which implies @xmath13 possible hydrogen positions for the total crystal .",
    "only six configurations are energetically favorable out of 16 possible ones for each oxygen .",
    "the upper limit for a number of ground state configurations , @xmath14 , can be , therefore , estimated as @xmath15 .",
    "corresponding entropy can be calculated as @xmath16 , which gives 3.37  j  mol@xmath10  k@xmath17 .",
    "that value agrees very well with the experimentally measured @xcite . despite calculations performed by pauling missed the global constraint of the number of hydrogens and local constraints caused by closed loops in the lattice of the hexagonal water ice , its accuracy is of order of 1 - 2 % @xcite .",
    "it has been calculated numerically for the two- and three - dimensional ice model ( see below ) .",
    "ice - type models , i.e. , the ones , which possess ice rules , are often studied in statistical mechanics : they are the particular case of vortex models , namely , the six - vortex models .",
    "any ice model is defined on a lattice with the coordination number 4 , i.e. , each vertex is connected to four nearest neighbors by an edge .",
    "each bond is represented by an arrow , so that the number of arrows pointing to the vortex is two ( as well as the number of arrows pointing outwards ) , which constitutes the ice rule in the vertex model .",
    "so far , mostly two- and three - dimensional ice vertex models has been studied .",
    "for instance , for the square ice model six configurations are valid .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of vertices with @xmath21-th configuration ( of six possibilities ) , and @xmath22 being the energy associated with the vertex configuration @xmath21 .",
    "[ 6vert ] shows six possible configurations of the six - vertex square model , which satisfy the ice rule .",
    "the six - vertex model on a square lattice can model a ferroelectric @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . if there is no external field , the condition @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 holds .",
    "the six - vertex model on a square lattice has been exactly solved by e.  lieb @xcite .",
    "he has found the residual entropy there @xmath28 , and the value @xmath29 is known as the lieb s square ice constant .",
    "later lieb s solution has been generalized for the cases with @xcite and without external field @xcite .",
    "naturally , one can consider more realistic models , than the two - dimensional six - vertex model on the square lattice .",
    "however , for the three - dimensional ice - type model the exact solution has been obtained @xcite only for the special temperature interval , where the model is called to be `` frozen '' , which means that in the thermodynamic limit the energy and entropy per vortex are zero in such a range of @xmath30 .",
    "ice - type vertex models in statistical mechanics are generalized for the eight - vertex model , which also possesses exact solution @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the water ice problem to the ordering of cations in the so - called inverse spinel material has been pointed out by e.j.w .",
    "verwey @xcite , and then has been discussed in detail by p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite .",

    "the b - sites of the spinel lattice form the so - called pyrochlore lattice .",

    "the minimum energy is related to the case , in which the number of pairs consisting of two different kinds of cations is maximal .",
    "such a condition is satisfied if each elementary tetrahedron of the b - lattice of the inverse spinel material has two cations of one kind and two cations of the other kind , so called tetrahedron rule , analogous to the ice rule for the hexagonal water ice .",
    "notice that in the spinel lattice centers of tetrahedra are situated on the same lattice as oxygens in the cubic i@xmath5 water ice .",
    "it implies that cation ordering in this problem could have residual entropy , like in the pauling water ice .    among spinels with different cations at b - sites",
    "we can distinguish the situation , in which the valency of ions is different from integer , like in the first non - rare - earth based heavy - fermion system liv@xmath0o@xmath31 see , e.g. , @xcite , or in , probably , the oldest known magnetic material , magnetite , fe@xmath35o@xmath31 see , e.g. , @xcite . there the formal valence of v ion is 3.5 , and the one of fe on b sites is 2.5 ( the valence of fe ions on a sites is 3 ) , i.e. , they have to exist in equal combinations of v@xmath36 and v@xmath37 , or fe@xmath38 and fe@xmath36 .",

    "the analysis of that behavior implies the presence of the relaxation process with the typical time scales satisfying arrhenius law @xmath195 with activation energies @xmath196  k , which agrees with recent muon spin relaxation studies @xcite , which give the muon relaxation rate of similar form @xmath197 with @xmath198  k. it means that such a relaxation involves transitions to the higher - energy single - ion multiplets of rare earth ions . on the other hand ,",
    "another dynamical processes in spin ices in the temperature range between 5  k and 10  k did not show any significant temperature dependence @xcite , which has been interpreted as caused by the quantum tunneling effect between up- and down - directed states of effective ising spins . notice that @xmath199sr ( muon spin relaxation ) and ac susceptibility measurements observed relaxation rates different of each other up to three orders of magnitude , perhaps , because of the local character of the @xmath199sr probe .",
    "depolarization of muons is caused mostly by the development on cooling of strong inhomogeneous internal fields ( almost static ) .",

    "the latter @xcite manifested features in the sound characteristics of spin ice systems ( sound velocity and attenuation ) different for increasing and decreasing external field value , which also implies different relaxation processes in spin ices at low temperatures of order of 0.03  k.    studies of other representatives of the spin ice family , namely , of stannates , dy@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath34 and ho@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath34 were performed in @xcite .",
    "the interest in spin ices has been considerably grown after the pioneering suggestion that magnetic monopoles can exist as emerging quasiparticles there @xcite .    in physics ,",
    "the term `` emergence '' is used to describe a phenomenon , which can exist at macroscopic scales ( in space or time ) but not at microscopic scales , despite such a macroscopic system can be considered as a large ensemble of microscopic systems .",
    "it is used to distinguish which laws can be applied to macroscopic scales , and which ones only to microscopic scales .",

    "for the recent example of emergent phenomenon in frustrated magnetic systems , see , e.g. , @xcite .      by magnetic monopoles",
    "we usually mean a particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole .",
    "already in 19th century p.  curie pointed out that magnetic monopoles could exist .",
    "however , mainly the problem of magnetic monopoles is associated with p.a.m .",
    "dirac , who has constructed the quantum theory of magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "he has emphasized that quantum mechanics did not preclude the existence of magnetic monopoles , and shown , in particular , that if magnetic monopoles existed , then the electric charge had to be quantized .",
    "we know , naturally , that the electric charge _ is _ quantized , however this fact , unfortunately , does not prove the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "standard maxwell s equations describe magnetism as related to the motion of electric charges ( take into account that in quantum mechanics particles can have `` intrinsic '' magnetic moment related to their spin ) .",
    "the multipole expansion produces first monopole , then dipole , quadrupole , etc . for the electric field",
    "the multipole expansion can have the monopole term ( charge ) , while for the magnetic field there is no such a term .",
    "that is why , maxwell s equations describe electric charges , but not magnetic charges , despite they are symmetric with respect to the interchange of magnetic and electric fields ( except of the absence of magnetic charges ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we can formally write symmetric maxwell s equations , with magnetic monopoles . two of maxwell s equations , gauss s law , and ampre s law , are not changed ( here we use si units ) @xmath200 = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0 { \\partial { \\bf e } \\over   \\partial t } + \\mu_0 { \\bf j}_e \\ ,   \\label{me1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the electric charge density and electric current density , respectively ( notice that the vacuum permittivity is @xmath203  f  m@xmath204 , and @xmath205 )",

    "the divergence of @xmath85 is equal to zero almost everywhere , except for the origin at @xmath216 .",
    "we can locally define the vector potential such that the curl of the vector potential is @xmath217 = { \\bf b}$ ] .",
    "such vector potential can not be defined exactly everywhere , because the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the dirac delta function at the origin .",
    "dirac defined one vector potential on the `` northern hemisphere '' ( above the particle ) , and another one for the `` southern hemisphere '' .",
    "these two vector potentials are matched at the `` equator '' , and they differ by a gauge transformation .",
    "the wave function of an electrically - charged particle that moves around the origin along the `` equator '' is changed by a phase as in the aharonov  bohm - casher effect .",
    "this phase is proportional to the electric charge @xmath208 of the moving particle and to the magnetic charge @xmath209 of the source .",
    "the electric charge returns to the same point after the total trip around the sphere .",
    "the phase of its wave function must be unchanged .",
    "it implies that the phase added to the wave function must be a multiple of @xmath218 .",
    "hence , dirac s quantum theory means quantization of electric and magnetic charges @xmath219 where @xmath146 is an integer . actually , dirac s theory describes an infinitesimal line solenoid as in the aharonov - bohm - casher effect @xcite , ending at a point .",

    "the interesting study has investigated the behavior of entropy in artificial the spin ice system @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that nearest - neighbor correlations drive the longer - range ones there .    as a result of the magnetic frustration",
    ", these systems can exhibit magnetic monopole type states , which are an example of an exotic emergent quasiparticle @xcite .",
    "for example , magnetic monopoles and associated dirac - like strings have been directly observed in the artificial honeycomb ( on co films of 20  nm thickness ) and kagome spin ice ( permalloy films ) systems @xcite using magnetic force microscopy and x - ray photoemission microscopy .",
    "to remind , the kagome lattice can be realized in pyrochlore spin ices by applying [ 111 ] external magnetic field . in particular , for the visualization of magnetic monopoles in permalloy systems the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism was used .",
    "dirac - like strings were observed as a history of propagating monopole - antimonopole pairs .",
    "creation of such pairs as well as their movement has been regulated by the external magnetic field in the reversed ( with respect to the magnetic moments of islands ) direction .",
    "randomness , as for other artificial spin ices , see above , plays an important role for the physics of monopoles .",
    "in contrast to pyrochlore oxides , where magnetic monopoles form a gas and dirac s strings are dynamically fluctuating , in an artificial spin ice one deals at large enough values of the external magnetic field with the effective low - temperature case , in which after each field step ( change of the magnetization of an island ) random variations in the switching field pin monopoles and related dirac s strings .",
    "monopoles become trapped .",
    "namely that property permits to image monopole - antimonopole configurations before increasing the value of the field , and to manipulate with such magnetic charges . dirac s strings grow in the horizontal or diagonal directions of the two - dimensional lattice as a result of one - dimensional avalanche processes @xcite .",
    "artificial spin ices reveal also the anomalous hall effect @xcite , which , like in the ferromagnetic srruo@xmath35 is believed to be caused by the movement of magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "studies of magnetic frustrated systems nowadays belong to the one of the most developing branches of the low - temperature condensed matter physics .",
    "it is determined by the great variety of new physical concepts , which were applied , and plenty of new physical effects , observed in this field .",
    "spin ices , magnetic monopoles , higgs effect , anomalous kondo and hall physics : all of them have been observed and explained during recent years in frustrated magnets .",
    "the studies of magnetic frustrated systems are far from being complete ; many new important and interesting effects are waiting for their discoveries .",
    "least but not the last : frustrated magnets are important not only due to their fundamentally interesting physical properties , but also because of their perspective usefulness as data storages and memories for computers , or as possible realizations of the topological quantum computation .",
    "it is possible that , when reviewing such a swiftly developing field of physics with a great number of important works , and trying to mention all of them , i , perhaps , have not cited some interesting publications .",
    "i sincere apologize to those of authors , whose contributions to the field of spin ices and magnetic monopoles there are not mentioned in my article .      preprinted figures with permission from h.  fukuzawa _ et al .",

    "<S> during recent years the interest to frustrated magnets has grown considerably . </S>",
    "<S> such systems reveal very peculiar properties which distinguish them from standard paramagnets , magnetically ordered regular systems ( like ferro- , ferri- , and antiferromagnets ) , or spin glasses . in particular great amount of attention has been devoted to the so - called spin ices , in which magnetic frustration together with the large value of the single - ion magnetic anisotropy of a special kind , yield peculiar behavior . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most exciting features of spin ices is related to low - energy emergent excitations , which , from many viewpoints can be considered as analogies of dirac s monopoles . in this article </S>",
