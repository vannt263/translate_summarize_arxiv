    "terrestrial planet formation is generally thought to have proceeded in two main stages : the first consists of the accretion of planetesimals , which leads to the formation of several dozens of roughly mars - sized planetary embryos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the second stage consists of a series of giant impacts between these embryos that merge to form the earth and other terrestrial planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "understanding how much of the planets primordial atmosphere is retained during the giant impact phase is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres .",
    "in addition , a planet s or proptoplanet s atmosphere can not only be lost due to a collision with a comparably sized body in a giant impact , but also due to much smaller impacts by planetesimals . during planet formation",
    "giant impacts begin when the planetesimals are no longer able to efficiently damp the eccentricities of the growing protoplanets .",
    "order of magnitude estimates that balance the stirring rates of the protoplanets with the damping rates due to dynamical friction by the planetesimal population and numerical simulations find that giant impacts set in when the total mass in protoplanets is comparable to the mass in planetesimals @xcite . therefore about 50% of the total mass still resides in planetesimals when giant impacts begin and planetesimal accretion continues throughout the giant impact phase .",
    "furthermore , geochemical evidence from highly siderophile element ( hse ) abundance patterns inferred for the terrestrial planets and the moon suggest that a total of about @xmath20 of chondritic material was delivered as ` late veneer ' by planetesimals to the terrestrial planets after the end of giant impacts @xcite .",
    "this suggests that planetesimal accretion did not only proceed throughout the giant impacts stage by continued beyond .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the origin and evolution of the terrestrial planets atmospheres one needs to examine the contribution to atmospheric loss from both the giant impacts and from planetesimal accretion .    depending on impactor sizes , impact velocities and impact angles ,",
    "volatiles may be added to or removed from growing planetary embryos by impacts of other planetary embryos and smaller planetesimals .",
    "the survival of primordial atmospheres through the stage of giant impacts during terrestrial planet formation has been examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works numerically integrate the hydrodynamic equations of motion of the planetary atmosphere to determine the amount of atmospheric loss for various ground velocities .",
    "in contrast to giant impacts , smaller impactors can not eject the planet s atmosphere globally but are limited to , at best , ejecting all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site .",
    "some of the first calculations of impact induced atmospheric erosion were performed using the @xcite solution for the expansion of a vapor plume and momentum balance between the expanding gas and the mass of the overlying atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results of these calculations were used to investigate the evolution of planetary atmospheres as a result of planetesimal impacts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated by analytical and computational means the effect of @xmath21  km impactors on terrestrial atmospheres using an analytical model based on the solutions of @xcite .",
    "atmospheric erosion calculations were extended further by , for example , @xcite and @xcite who investigated numerically atmospheric loss and replenishment and the role of oblique impacts , respectively . in the work presented here , we use order of magnitude estimates and numerical simulations to calculate the atmospheric mass loss over the entire range of impactor sizes , spanning impacts too small to eject significant amounts of atmosphere to planetary - embryo scale giant impacts .",
    "our results demonstrate that the most efficient impactors ( per impactor mass ) for atmospheric loss are small planetesimals which , for the current atmosphere of the earth , are only about 2  km in radius .",
    "we show that these small planetesimal impacts could have potentially totally dominated the atmospheric mass loss over earth s history and during planet formation in general .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we use analytic self - similar solutions and full numerical integrations to calculate the amount of atmosphere lost during giant impacts for an isothermal and adiabatic atmosphere .",
    "we analytically calculate the atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal impacts in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare and contrast the atmospheric mass loss due to giant impacts and planetesimal accretion and show that planetesimal impacts likely played a more important role for atmospheric loss of terrestrial planets than giant impacts .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for terrestrial planet formation and compare our findings with recent geochemical constraints on atmospheric loss and the origin of earth s atmosphere in section 5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in section 6 .",
    "when an impact occurs the planet s atmosphere can be lost in two distinct ways : first , the expansion of plumes generated at the impact site can expel the atmosphere locally but not globally .",
    "atmospheric loss is therefore limited to at best @xmath22 of the total atmosphere , where @xmath11 is the atmospheric scale height and @xmath12 the planetary radius ( see section [ s2 ] for details ) .",
    "second , giant impacts create a strong shock that propagates through the planetary interior causing a global ground motion of the proto - planet . this ground motion in turn launches a strong shock into the planetary atmosphere , which can lead to loss of a significant fraction of or even the entire atmosphere .",
    "it was realized several decades ago that self - similar solutions provide an excellent description for a shock propagating in adiabatic and isothermal atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here ,",
    "we take advantage of these self - similar solutions and use them together with full numerical integrations to calculate the atmospheric mass loss due to giant impacts .",
    "terrestrial planet s atmospheres , like the earth s , are to first order isothermal , giving rise to an exponential density profile .",
    "we therefore solve the hydrodynamic equations for a shock propagating in an atmosphere with an exponential density profile given by @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the density on the ground , @xmath24 the height in the atmosphere measured from the ground and @xmath11 the atmospheric scale height .",
    "the atmosphere is assumed to be planar , which is valid for the terrestrial planets since their atmospheric scale heights are small compared to their radii .",
    "we further assume that radiative losses can be neglected such that the flow is adiabatic .",
    "the adiabatic hydrodynamic equations are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the adiabatic index and @xmath29 the ordinary stokes time derivative .",
    "thanks to the self - similar behavior of the flow , the solutions to hydrodynamic equations above can be separated into their time - dependent and spatial parts and can be written as @xmath30g(\\zeta ) , \\quad   \\ u(z , t)=\\dot z u(\\zeta ) , \\quad   \\ p(z , t)=\\rho_0 \\exp[-z(t)/h ] \\dot z^2 p(\\zeta)\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the position of the shock front and @xmath32 .",
    "the similarity variables for the density , velocity and pressure are given by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "using the expressions in equation ( [ e4 ] ) and substituting them into the hydrodynamic equations ( [ e3])-([e32 ] ) yields for the spatial parts @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 and a time dependent part given by @xmath39 using the strong shock conditions we have @xmath40    having separated the hydrodynamic equations into their time - dependent and spatial parts and we now obtain their self - similar solution . the solution to equation ( [ e103 ] )",
    "yields the position of the shock front as a function of time and is given by @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 is the ground velocity at the interface between the ground the atmosphere .",
    "equation ( [ e11 ] ) shows that the shock accelerates fast enough such that it arrives at infinity in time @xmath44 .",
    "the ground in contrast only transverses a distance @xmath45 , which is a few scale heights , in the same time .",
    "although various solutions to equations ( [ e1011])-([e1021 ] ) exist for different values of @xmath46 , the physically relevant solution corresponds to a unique value of @xmath46 which allows passage through a critical point , @xmath47 .",
    "this critical point corresponds to the sonic point in the time - dependent flow .",
    "self - smilar solutions that include passage trough the sonic point are generally referred to as type ii self - similar solutions .",
    "for example , we find , consistent with previous works @xcite , that for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the critical point is located at @xmath50 and similarly , for @xmath0 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since the self - similar solutions have to pass through the sonic point , only the region between the shock front and the sonic point are in communication and the part of the flow beyond the sonic point is cut off .",
    "the beauty of this is that the solution of the hydrodynamic equations becomes independent of the detailed nature of the initial shock conditions , such that the velocity of the ground motion that launches the shock only enters in the form of multiplicative constants in the asymptotic self - similar solution .",

    "the final atmospheric mass loss fraction is therefore @xmath64 where the only quantity left to calculate numerically is the acceleration factor @xmath61 given by @xmath65 it is convenient to write @xmath61 as the product of the acceleration factor until the shock has reached infinity @xmath66 , which happens at time @xmath44 , and the acceleration factor from the time that the shock reached @xmath67 to a long time after that @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 .",
    "the latter is important because a given fluid element continues to accelerate after @xmath44 .",
    "the two parts of the acceleration factor can be written as @xmath70 equations ( [ eb1 ] ) required that we take the limit for @xmath71 and @xmath72 together .",

    "furthermore , the atmosphere close to the ground is not accelerated as much as fluid elements with initial positions significantly above the ground .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the actual value of @xmath61 and an accurate atmospheric mass loss for the part of the atmosphere that resides close to the ground , we performed full numerical integrations of the hydrodynamic equations .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the two components of the acceleration as a function of the distance from the shock front , @xmath71 , for an exponential and adiabatic atmospheric density profile .",

    ", one needs to obtain the resulting distribution of ground velocities , @xmath43 , across the planet from a giant impact and use these to calculate the local atmospheric mass loss and sum the results over the whole planet . in the following subsection ( section 2.3 ) we use a simple impact model to obtain the global atmospheric mass loss as a function of the impactor mass and velocity .        to obtain the total atmospheric mass lost in a given impact we need to relate the impactor mass , @xmath115 , and impact velocity , @xmath4 , to the resulting ground motion at the various locations of the protoplanet and use these together with equations ( [ e11x ] ) and ( [ e1901 ] ) to obtain the local atmospheric mass loss and sum the results over the surface of the planet . when an impactor hits a protoplanet , it initially transfers most of its energy to a volume comparable to its own size at the impact site .",
    "a significant fraction of this energy will escape from the site via a small amount of impact ejecta , but some of the energy will propagate through the protoplanet as a shock . using a very simple impact model , we approximate the impacts as point like explosions on a sphere .",
    "this is similar to the treatment of point like explosions on a planar surface between a vacuum and a half - infinite space filled with matter .",
    "such an explosion results again in a self - similar solution of the second type @xcite .",
    "as the shock propagates it must lose energy because some of the shocked material flows into vacuum , but its momentum is increased by the nonzero pressure in the protoplanet . as a result , the shock s velocity should fall off faster than dictated by energy conservation but slower than required by momentum conservation . numerical simulations of catastrophic impacts find scaling laws that are close to the ones derived by assuming momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the catastrophic destruction threshold , defined as the impact energy per unit target mass required to eject 50% of the target , scales as @xmath116 , which is close to the linear scaling with @xmath12 predicted from momentum conservation for fixed impactor velocity .",
    "we therefore assume momentum conservation of the shock , @xmath117 , as it propagates through the target and use it to calculate the resulting ground velocity across the protoplanet ( see figure [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "this treatment is similar to the ` snowplow ' phase of an expanding supernova remnant during which the matter of the ambient intersteller medium is swept up by the expanding shock and momentum is conserved . the volume of the protoplanet that a spherical shock , originating from an impact point on the protoplanet s surface , transversed as a function of distance from the impact point , @xmath118 , is given by @xmath119 and shown as light blue region in figure [ fig16 ] .",
    "this volume is equivalent to the volume of two intersecting spheres with radii @xmath12 and @xmath118 where the center of sphere corresponding to the shock co - insides with the surface of the protoplanet of radius , @xmath12 . assuming a constant density of the target and momentum conservation the velocity of the shocked fluid traveling through the protoplanet is given by @xmath120 where @xmath118 is the distance of the shock travelled from the impact point , such that @xmath121 when the shock reaches the antipode ( see figure [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "the ground velocity with which the shock is launched into the atmosphere is due to the component of the shocked fluid velocity that is perpendicular to the planet s surface , such that @xmath122 , which yields @xmath123 figure [ fig6 ] shows the shocked fluid velocity , @xmath124 , and the ground velocity , @xmath43 , as a function of distance travelled by the shock through the planet .",
    "@xmath43 has a minimum at @xmath125 .",
    "our simple impact model assumes that the target has a constant density and neglects any impact angle dependence .",
    "the latter is a reasonable assumption as long as the impactor mass is significantly less than the target mass .",
    "the former is a reasonable first order approximation given our general ignorance concerning the interior structure of planetary embryos during their formation .",
    "equations ( [ eaxr1 ] ) and ( [ eax1 ] ) assume momentum conservation within the target . for comparison ,",
    "if we instead assume momentum conservation in a uniform density half - infinite sphere and compare it to equations ( [ eaxr1 ] ) and ( [ eax1 ] ) , we find average shocked fluid velocities and ground velocities that are about a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "this implies that we may somewhat overestimate the global atmospheric loss due to giant impacts .    , and impact velocity , @xmath126 , impacts a target with mass , @xmath127 , and radius , @xmath12 . assuming momentum conservation , we calculate the shocked fluid velocity , @xmath124 , and the component of the ground velocity normal to the surface , @xmath128 , as a function of the distance from the impact point.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and the ground velocity @xmath43 as a function of distance travelled by the shock , @xmath118 , from the impact point to the other side of the planet , @xmath121.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      to ensure the entire atmosphere is lost we required that @xmath129 ( see equations ( [ e11x ] ) , ( [ e1901 ] ) and ( [ eax1 ] ) ) , where we set @xmath83 to account for the fact that if we want to eject all of the atmosphere , we do have to lose also the part of the atmosphere immediately above the ground for which @xmath83 . substituting for @xmath43 and rearranging yields that all of the atmosphere is lost provided that @xmath130    only part of the global atmosphere is lost for @xmath131 the atmospheric mass loss as a function of @xmath132 is shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "when only a fraction of the atmosphere is lost , it is interesting to note that the total atmospheric loss consists of two components : the first is from the area of the planet s surface where the ground motion is large enough such that locally all the atmosphere is lost ( dashed line in figure [ fig7 ] ) , the second component corresponds to the region of the planet where the local ground velocity is small enough such that only part of the atmosphere is lost ( thin solid line in figure [ fig7 ] ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the local fractional mass loss is given by equation ( [ e11x ] ) for an isothermal and equation ( [ e1901 ] ) for an adiabatic atmosphere , respectively .",
    "in the limit that @xmath133 , equation ( [ eax1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath134 such that in the limit of small total atmospheric mass loss we have @xmath135 in addition to the regions undergoing total atmospheric loss , we also have a contribution form parts of the planet undergoing partial loss , yielding a total atmospheric mass loss fraction @xmath136 .",
    "we note here that this formalism is less accurate for small impactor masses with @xmath137 , since it does not include any atmosphere ejected directly at the impact site ( see section 3 ) .    more generally , we find that the global mass loss fraction for an isothermal atmosphere is , independent of the exact value of the adiabatic index , well approximated by @xmath138 and is plotted as dotted line , which is barely distinguishable from the thick solid line , in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "similarly , for an adiabatic atmosphere we find @xmath139     is given by @xmath140 ( dotted line).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figure [ fig8 ] shows the total atmospheric mass loss fraction for an isothermal ( solid lines ) and adiabatic atmosphere ( dotted line ) as a function of impactor to target mass ratio for various impact velocities . for a mars - sized impactor hitting an @xmath141 protoplanet with @xmath137 , we find @xmath142% .",
    "this is about a factor of 2 lower than estimates by @xcite who assumed an average ground velocity of @xmath143  km / s across the whole protoplanet and used this velocity together with their local atmospheric mass loss results ( similar to the ones shown in figure [ fig5 ] ) to estimate a global atmospheric mass loss of 10% .",
    "we show here , however , that the global atmospheric mass loss consists of two components , where the first component is from parts of the planet where the ground motion is large enough such that locally all the atmosphere is lost ( dashed line in figure [ fig7 ] ) and the second component corresponds to the region of the planet where the local ground velocity is small enough such that only part of the atmosphere is lost ( thin solid line in figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this makes the _ average _ ground velocity inadequate for determining the global atmospheric mass loss .    in the atmospheric mass loss calculations presented in this section",
    ", we assume that ratio of specific heats , @xmath28 , is constant throughout the flow . however , the temperatures reached during the shock propagation are high enough to lead to ionization of the atmosphere , which in turn will decrease the value of @xmath28 and consequently result in reduced atmospheric mass loss .",
    "the atmospheric mass loss due to giant impacts calculated in this section is therefore an overestimate .    , calculated by taking into account the different ground velocities across the planet s surface.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "although smaller impactors can not individually eject a large fraction of the planetary atmosphere , they collectively can play an important role in atmospheric erosion and , as we show in section 4 , may easily dominate atmospheric mass loss during planet formation .      unlike giant impacts which can create a strong shock propagating through the planetary interior that in turn can launch a strong shock into the planetary atmosphere , smaller planetesimal collisions can only eject the atmosphere locally .",
    "when a high - velocity impactor hits the surface of the protoplanet , its velocity is sharply decelerated and its kinetic energy is rapidly converted into heat and pressure resulting in something analogous to an explosion @xcite . similar to @xcite , we model the impact as a point explosion on the surface , where a mass equal to the mass of the impactor , @xmath5 , propagates isotropically into a half - sphere with velocity of order , @xmath3 .",
    "atmosphere is ejected only where its mass per unit solid angle , as measured from the impact point , is less than that of the ejecta , @xmath144 .",
    "we can then relate the impactor mass , @xmath5 , to the ejected atmospheric mass @xmath145 ( see following equations ( [ sp1 ] ) , ( [ e101 ] ) and ( [ ex2 ] ) ) .",
    "these two masses are not equal because the planetesimal impact launches a point - like isotropic explosion into a half - sphere on the planetary surface , but the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane is not isotropically distributed around the impact site ( see figure [ fig14 ] ) , but is more concentrated towards the horizon .",
    "specifically , the atmospheric mass close to the tangent plane of the impact site is hardest to eject due to its larger column density .     of the total atmosphere .",
    "however , since smaller impactors are more numerous than larger ones required for giant impacts , smaller impactors may actually dominate the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in order to distinguish between the impactor mass and the mass ejected from the atmosphere we use @xmath146 for the mass in the atmosphere that is ejected and , as in section 2 , @xmath115 and @xmath147 to describe the mass and radius of the impactor . assuming an isothermal atmosphere , which is a good approximation for the current earth , the atmospheric mass inside a cone defined by angle @xmath148 measured from the normal of the impact site ( see figure [ fig14 ] ) is given by @xmath149 \\sin \\theta ' a^2 d\\theta ' da\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the atmospheric density at the surface of the planet and @xmath24 is the height in the atmosphere above the ground and is related to @xmath150 , the distance from the impact site to the top of the atmosphere ( see figure [ fig14 ] ) , by @xmath151 . integrating over the whole cap , i.e. from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , yields a total cap mass of @xmath154 in the limit that @xmath155 , which applies for the terrestrial planets .",
    "this is the maximum atmospheric mass that a single planetesimal impact can eject and is given by all the mass above the tangent plane of the impact site .",

    "for such impactors , the ejected mass to impactor mass ratio is only @xmath296 , implying that one only needs about 5 times the total atmospheric mass in such small impactors to active complete loss .",

    "<S> 2 ) smaller impactors , but above @xmath14 ( 1  km for the current earth ) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the most efficient impactors ( per unit impactor mass ) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit ( 2  km for the current earth ) . for impactor flux size distributions </S>",
    "<S> parametrized by a single power law , @xmath15 , with differential power law index @xmath16 , we find that for @xmath17 the atmospheric mass loss proceeds in regime 1 ) whereas for @xmath18 the mass loss is dominated by regime 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> impactors with @xmath19 are not able to eject any atmosphere . despite being bombarded by the same planetesimal population , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current differences in earth s and venus atmospheric masses can be explained by modest differences in their initial atmospheric masses and that the current atmosphere of the earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimal impacts . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets . </S>"
