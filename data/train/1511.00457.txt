    "the weak symmetry breaking task ( wsb ) for @xmath0 processes is an  inputless task with possible outputs @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a  distributed protocol is said to solve the wsb if in any execution without failed processes , there exists at least one process which has value @xmath2 as well as at least one process which has value  @xmath3 .",
    "wsb for @xmath0 processes is equivalent to the hard @xmath4-renaming task .    in the classical setting ,",
    "the processes know their i d s , and are allowed to compare them .",
    "it is however not allowed that any other information about i d s is used .",
    "the protocols with this property are called _ comparison - based_. in practice this means that behavior of each process only depends on the relative position of its i d among the i d s of the processes it witnesses and not on its actual numerical value . as a  special case , we note that each process must output the same value in case he does not witness other processes at all . weak symmetry breaking is a standard task in theoretical distributed computing , and its solvability is a  sophisticated question which has been extensively studied .",
    "the results of this paper apply to the standard computational model called _ iterated immediate snapshot_. in this model the processes use two atomic operations being performed on shared memory .",
    "these operations are : _ write _ into the register assigned to that process , and _ snapshot read _ , which reads entire memory in one atomic step .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the executions are well - structured in the sense that they must satisfy the two following conditions .",
    "first , it is only allowed that at each time a  group of processes gets active , these processes perform a  write operation together , and then they perform a  snapshot read operation together ; no other interleaving in time of the write and read operations is permitted .",
    "such executions are called _ immediate snapshot _ executions .",
    "second , each execution can be broken up in rounds , where in every round each non - faulty process gets activated precisely once , alternatively , this can be phrased as each process using fresh memory every time its gets activated .",
    "this model , used extensively in distributed computing , has the major advantage that the protocol complexes have a comparatively simple simplicial structure , and are amenable to mathematical analysis . specifically , the existence of a  distributed protocol solving wsb in @xmath5 rounds is equivalent to the existence of a certain @xmath6-labeling of the vertices of the @xmath5th iterated standard chromatic subdivision of an  @xmath7-simplex .",
    "the iterated immediate snapshot model is due to gafni&borowsky , see their foundational work  @xcite ; in  @xcite this model goes under the name _ layered immediate snapshot_. several groups of researchers have studied the solvability of the wsb by means of comparison - based iis protocols .",
    "due primarily to the work of herlihy&shavit , @xcite , as well as castaeda&rajsbaum , @xcite , it is known that the wsb is solvable if and only if the number of processes is not a  prime power , see also @xcite for a  counting - based argument for the impossibility part .",
    "this makes @xmath8 the smallest number of processes for which this task is solvable .",
    "the combinatorial structures arising in related questions on subdivisions of simplex paths have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the specific case @xmath8 has been studied in @xcite , who has proved the existence of the distributed protocol which solves the wsb task in 17 rounds .",
    "this bound was recently improved to 3 rounds in  @xcite , where also an explicit protocol was given .",
    "we recommend  @xcite as a general reference for theoretical distributed computing , and @xcite as a general reference for combinatorial topology .",
    "furthermore , our book  @xcite contains all the standard terminology , which we are using here , and which the lack of space does not allow us to introduce in detail .    a  broader framework of symmetry breaking tasks can be found in  @xcite",
    ". the topological description for the iis model can be found in @xcite ; in addition , topological descriptions of several other computational models have also been studied , see  @xcite .",
    "our main result states that there is an infinite set of numbers of processes for which wsb can be solved in @xmath1 rounds in the comparison - based iis model . specifically , we prove that this is the case when the number of processes is divisible by  @xmath9 .",
    "there is @xmath10 overhead cost to translate an iis protocol to an is protocol , so the resulting is complexity is @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the minimal number of rounds which is needed for an iis protocol to solve wsb for @xmath0 processes , then our main theorem can succinctly be stated as follows .",
    "[ thm:6n ] for all @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 .    our proof is based on combinatorial analysis of certain matchings in the so - called flip graphs , and strictly speaking does not need any topology .",
    "it has long been understood , that there is a  1-to-1 correspondence between iis protocols solving wsb on one hand and binary assignments @xmath14 to the vertices of the iterated chromatic subdivision of a  simplex , on the other hand , where these assignments must satisfy certain technical boundary conditions , and have no monochromatic top - dimensional simplices .",
    "furthermore , herlihy&shavit found an  obstruction to the existence of such an assignment in case the number of vertices of that simplex ( i.e. , the number of processes ) is a  prime power .",
    "this obstruction is a  number which only depends on the values of @xmath14 on the boundary of the subdivided simplex , and which must be @xmath2 if there are no monochromatic maximal simplices .",
    "thus the construction of iis protocols solving wsb has been reduced to finding such @xmath14 , where the number of iis rounds is equal to the number of iterations of the standard chromatic subdivision . the construction of @xmath14 , when the number is not a prime power , was then done by castaeda&rajsbaum using the following method .",
    "first , boundary values are assigned , making sure that this obstruction value is  @xmath2 .",
    "after that the rest of the values is assigned , taking some care that only few monochromatic maximal simplices appear in the process .",
    "after this there is a sophisticated and costly reduction procedure where these monochromatic simplices are connected by paths and eventually eliminated .",
    "this elimination procedure is notoriously hard to control , leading to exponential bounds .",
    "the idea which we introduce in this paper is radically different .",
    "just as castaeda&rajsbaum we produce a boundary labeling making sure the invariant is @xmath2 . however after that our approaches diverge in a  crucial way .",
    "we assign value @xmath2 to * all * internal vertices .",
    "this is quite counter - intuitive , as we are trying to get rid of the monochromatic simplices in the long run , while such an assignment on the contrary will produce an  enormous amount of them .",
    "however , the following key observation comes to our rescue : if we can match the monochromatic simplices with each other so that any pair of matched simplices shares a boundary simplex of one dimension lower , then we can eliminate them all in one go using one more round .",
    "next , we make a bridge to combinatorics .",
    "we have a graph , whose vertices are all the monochromatic maximal simplices , connected by an edge if they share a boundary simplex of one dimension lower ; we shall call such graphs _ flip _ graphs .",
    "what we are looking for is a _ complete matching _ on graphs of this type .",
    "this is a  simple reduction , but it is very fruitful , since the matching theory on graphs is a  very well - developed subject and we find ourselves having many tools at our disposal .",
    "a  classical method to enlarge existing matchings is that of _ augmenting paths_. the idea is elementary but effective : connect the unmatched ( also called critical ) vertices by a  path @xmath15 , such that all other vertices on the path are matched by the edges along @xmath15 , and then make all the non - matching edges of @xmath15 matching and vice versa .",
    "this trick will keep all the internal vertices of @xmath15 matched , while also making end vertices matched . in particular ,",
    "if we have a matching , and we succeeded to connect critical vertices in pairs by non - intersection augmenting paths , then applying this trick to all these paths simultaneously , we will end up with a  complete matching .",
    "this set of ideas leads to the following blueprint for constructing the 3-round iis protocol to solve wsb for @xmath0 processes :    1 .   find a good boundary assignment for the second standard chromatic subdivision of the simplex with @xmath0 vertices , making sure the herlihy - shavit obstruction vanishes .",
    "assign value @xmath2 to _ all _ internal vertices .",
    "2 .   decompose the resulting flip graph of monochromatic simplices into pieces corresponding to the maximal simplices of the first chromatic subdivision .",
    "describe an initial matching on each of these pieces , and combine them to a  total matching .",
    "3 .   construct a  system of non - intersecting augmenting paths with respect to that total matching . changing our initial matching along these paths",
    "produces the desired complete matching .",
    "4 .   eliminate all monochromatic maximal simplices in one go , producing a  binary assignment for the third standard chromatic subdivision of the simplex with @xmath0 vertices , which now has no maximal monochromatic simplices .",
    "this is a general scheme , and if the technical details work out , it can be used for various values of @xmath0 and also for various numbers of rounds . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the values @xmath16 , mainly because this is the case in which we can provide complete rigorous details .",
    "the techniques of this paper can further be extended to discover other values of @xmath0 for which wsb can be solved in @xmath1 rounds , see @xcite . in that paper",
    ", progress has been made using techniques of sperner theory , see  @xcite , specifically a variation of local lym inequality , to cover values @xmath17 , see theorem  [ conj : prim ] .    to start with , for @xmath18 , there is a quite special arithmetic identity  , which has a  stronger set - theoretic version , see the proof of theorem  [ thm:6n ] , stating the existence of a  certain bijection  @xmath19 .",
    "we produce a  quite special labeling of the vertices on the boundary of @xmath20 , and we put the label @xmath2 on all the internal vertices of  @xmath20 . since any top - dimensional simplex has at least one internal vertex , we will have no @xmath3-monochromatic simplices at that point .",
    "this corresponds to the step 1 above .",
    "we then proceed with steps 2 and 3 , which are at the technical core of our proof .",
    "we start with a rough approximation to the matching which we want to get at the end . in this approximation , called the _ standard matching _ ,",
    "most of the simplices will get matched .",
    "there will be a small number of critical simplices left , concentrated around barycenters of certain boundary simplices .",
    "we then find a  system of augmenting paths which connect all the critical simplices in pairs .",
    "our idea of how to find these paths is to use the system of non - intersection paths in @xmath21 which we construct along the bijection @xmath19 , like a   system of tunnels  between areas of @xmath20 which contain the monochromatic simplices . within each such tunnel we use our analysis of the combinatorial structure of the flip graphs , namely certain properties , which we call _ conductivity _ of these graphs , to connect the critical simplices by augmenting paths , see figure  [ fig : pext ] .",
    "this yields the desired result , allowing us to produce a complete matching on the set of monochromatic simplices .",
    "step 4 is an easy and standard step which has been used before , we do not make any original contribution there .",
    "@xmath22 we start by recalling some graph terminology , which we need throughout the paper . for a  graph @xmath23",
