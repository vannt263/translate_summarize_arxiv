    "the qso absorption systems with hydrogen column densities @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) @xmath12 @xmath13  called damped ly@xmath2 systems ( dlas )  are believed to originate in intervening galaxies or protogalaxies located at cosmological distances ( wolfe et al .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of dlas is a fundamental tool for probing the chemical and physical properties of the associated high-@xmath14 galaxies and , more generally , of the high - redshift universe . in particular ,",
    "abundance studies have been performed in order to probe the nature of dla galaxies and to cast light on the early stages of galactic evolution ( lu et al .",
    "1996 , pettini et al .",
    "1997 , prochaska & wolfe 1999 , molaro et al .",
    "2000 ) . in abundance studies",
    "it is important to take into account both dust depletion and ionization effects before deriving conclusions on the nucleosynthetic processes at work in dla galaxies .",
    "the effects of dust depletion have been investigated by several research groups ( lauroesch et al .",
    "1996 ; kulkarni , fall & truran 1997 ; vladilo 1998 , hereafter paper i ; savaglio , panagia & stiavelli 2000 ) .",
    "all these studies indicate that dust corrections can have a significant impact on our understanding of the chemical history of dlas . in order to cast light on the intrinsic abundance trends some authors have analyzed dlas with modest or negligible dust content ( pettini et al . 2000 , molaro et al .",
    "2000 ) or elements which are essentially unaffected by dust depletions ( centurin et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the effects of ionization on the observed abundances .",
    "these effects are generally neglected because the abundances are derived from dominant ionization states of the elements of interest .",
    "it is well known from galactic interstellar studies that the dominant ionization state in h@xmath11 regions is the neutral one for elements with first ip @xmath15 13.6 ev ( e.g. o@xmath16 , n@xmath16 ) and the singly ionized one for elements with first ip @xmath17 13.6 ev and second ip @xmath15 13.6 ev ( e.g. c@xmath18 , mg@xmath18 , al@xmath1 , si@xmath18 , s@xmath18 , cr@xmath18 , mn@xmath18 , fe@xmath18 , and zn@xmath18 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the bulk of the h@xmath11 gas is self - shielded from h@xmath19 @xmath15 13.6 ev photons , but transparent to h@xmath19 @xmath17 13.6 ev photons .",
    "the first studies of ionization balance in dlas have indicated that ionization corrections are negligible for the low ions used in abundance determinations ( viegas 1995 , lu et al .",
    "1995 , prochaska & wolfe 1996 ) .",
    "however , the presence of al@xmath0 in dlas suggests that ionization corrections may be important . from the aluminium ionization potentials",
    " ip(al@xmath11)=5.99 ev and ip(al@xmath1)=18.83 ev  one expects al@xmath1 to be dominant and al@xmath0 to be essentially absent in h@xmath11 regions .",
    "the observations indicate that al@xmath0 is present in dlas at the same radial velocity of low ions , but at different radial velocity of high ions such as c@xmath20 and si@xmath20 ( lu et al .",
    "1996 , prochaska & wolfe 1999 , wolfe & prochaska 2000 ) . clearly , al@xmath0 is a tracer of moderately ionized gas associated to the neutral phase and the study of the al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ratio must bear important information on the effects of ionization on the derived abundances .    in a previous work",
    "we have performed detailed ionization calculations relevant to the ionized layer directly exposed to the ionizing radiation field ( howk & sembach 1999 ; hereafter paper ii ) . in that work",
    "the photoionization calculations have been stopped at the point in which the local ionization fraction of neutral hydrogen climbs above 10% . in the present work we first study the al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ratio from the observational point of view and we then perform photoionization calculations aimed at modeling this ratio . rather than analyzing individual absorbers , we study the general behavior of the al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ratio in a relatively large sample of dlas . in our computations",
    "we consider the possibility that the line of sight can intersect both neutral gas and partially ionized gas . at variance with paper",
    "ii , we also perform photoionization calculations stopped at fixed @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) values .",
    "in table 1 we present a compilation of aluminium column densities in dlas collected from the literature .",
    "references to the original works are reported in column 6 .",
    "only measurements performed on high resolution spectra obtained with 10-m class telescopes have been included in the list .",
    "most of the data have been obtained with the keck hires spectrograph and analyzed by only a few authors .",
    "the collected data set is therefore quite homogeneous from the observational point of view .",
    "nevertheless , we paid special attention on the reliability of the published column densities .",
    "in particular , we revised the available data for rejecting cases suspected to be affected by saturation or by telluric contamination .",
    "in addition , we investigated the velocity distribution of the absorption profiles .",
    "in fact the comparison of the column densities of al@xmath1 , al@xmath0 and other low ions that we perform here makes sense only if these ions have similar velocity profiles , suggesting that they are physically related .",
    "the al@xmath1 column densities are derived from the transition at @xmath21 nm which is often saturated .",
    "in fact , only lower limits are reported in the literature for a large fraction of cases .",
    "we have , in addition , found three more cases of suspected saturation from a revision of the absorption profiles .",
    "we treat also these three cases as lower limits even if they are quoted as real measurements in the original works ( see note @xmath22 in the table ) .",
    "the al@xmath0 column densities are derived from the transitions at @xmath23 nm and @xmath24 nm which are not affected by saturation effects .",
    "our re - analysis of the velocity profiles confirms that al@xmath0 has , in general , the same velocity distribution of the low ions ( wolfe & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "however , we found some exceptions which are marked with the explanatory notes @xmath25 and @xmath26 in table 1 .",
    "typically , we found evidence for an additional al@xmath0 absorption component displaced from the zero velocity component seen in al@xmath1 and/or other low ions . in most of these cases",
    "the equivalent width of this extra absorption is negligible compared with the total al@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the bulk of al@xmath0 originates in the same velocity range as al@xmath1 and the other low ions .    for the absorber at @xmath27 towards qso 0000 - 263 we found evidence for telluric contamination of the al@xmath0 185.4 nm profile from the analysis of a newly obtained spectrum of this target by means of uves at vlt ( molaro et al . 2000 ) . in table 1",
    "we report the column density obtained from the analysis of the 186.2 nm line , which is unaffected by contamination .",
    "careful inspection of the full set of profiles in the other dlas of table 1 does not reveal evidence for telluric contamination since the profiles of the two lines of the doublet are always similar when they are both available ( almost in all cases ) .      while al@xmath1 and other singly ionized species with ip @xmath28 ev can be present in the inner parts of h@xmath11 regions , the production of al@xmath0 requires photons with @xmath29 ev which can not as easily penetrate large h@xmath11 column densities . a careful analysis should therefore reveal a different behavior between al@xmath0 and singly ionized species .",
    "since the radial velocity analysis does not show evidence for a distinct behavior , we investigated the column density behavior of such species . for two species that are present in roughly constant proportions in the same region we expect to find a linear correlation with slope of unity between their logarithmic column densities .",
    "the identification of such a correlation would support a common origin of the different species .",
    "the lack of such a correlation could be ascribed to differences in the abundance / depletions patterns or to differences in the ionization properties . by analyzing ions of the same elements , such as al@xmath0 and al@xmath1",
    ", there can be no differences in the intrinsic abundances .",
    "studying such ions , therefore , gives information on the ionization state of the gas , and a slope differing from unity would indicate that ionization properties do affect the observed column densities .",
    "unfortunately , only a modest number of simultaneous determinations of al@xmath1 and al@xmath0 in dlas are currently known ( table 1 ) . to by - pass",
    "this limitation we compared the column densities of both al@xmath1 and al@xmath0 ions with those of fe@xmath1 and si@xmath1 , for which a large number of measurements are instead available . in practice , we performed a linear regression analysis of the column densities of each possible combination of pairs of the species al@xmath1 , al@xmath0 , si@xmath1 , and fe@xmath1 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 , where we give for each pair the number of data points available , @xmath30 , the correlation coefficient , @xmath31 , the slope , @xmath32 , and the intercept , @xmath33 , resulting from the linear regression . in fig .",
    "[ al2&si ] we show the results for al@xmath1 and si@xmath1 .",
    "one can see from table 2 that singly ionized species , including al@xmath1 are well correlated with each other and have slope of unity within the errors ) . ] .",
    "this fact , together with the similarity of the velocity profiles , suggests that all these species originate in the same region . on the other hand ,",
    "pairs of species including al@xmath0 show a modest correlation coefficient and a slope significantly lower than 1 .",
    "in addition , such pairs have larger dispersions than the corresponding pairs with al@xmath1 .",
    "for instance @xmath34(al@xmath0,si@xmath1 ) @xmath35 2 @xmath34(al@xmath1,si@xmath1 ) .",
    "this distinct behavior of al@xmath0 can not be attributed to differences in the abundances or dust depletions properties of al , fe and si .",
    "if such effects were important , they would also tend to cancel the correlations between al@xmath1 and fe@xmath1 and between al@xmath1 and si@xmath1 , which are instead clearly detected . since the distinct behavior of al@xmath0 is not due to intrinsic variations of the abundances / depletions , it must be due to the ionization properties of dla clouds .",
    "this observational result can be interpreted in two ways :    1 .",
    "the al@xmath0 originates in the same h@xmath11 region as the bulk of the low - ionization lines .",
    "the local value of the al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ratio varies among dla clouds .",
    "the al@xmath0 originates in a region distinct from , but physically related to , the h@xmath11 region where the bulk of the singly - ionized species reside .",
    "the relative column density contribution from the two regions varies among dla clouds .",
    "studies of the ionization properties of dlas usually consider only the first of the two possibilities . here",
    "we will also consider the second one .",
    "a separate al@xmath0 region may in fact exist if the photons with @xmath29 ev required for producing al@xmath0 are not available in the self - shielded parts of the h@xmath11 region . since the velocity structure of al@xmath0 and of low ions are generally similar , the al@xmath0 and h@xmath11 regions must be physically connected .",
    "a cloud structure consisting of a partially ionized al@xmath0-bearing interface bordering a h@xmath11 region opaque to @xmath36 ev photons satisfies the above requirements .",
    "the ratio al@xmath0/al@xmath1 can be used to constrain the ionization conditions and/or ionization structure of dlas . from the observational point of view",
    "we are able to measure the column density ratio @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) @xmath4 @xmath5(al@xmath0)/@xmath5(al@xmath1 ) , which gives information integrated along the line of sight .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) are currently possible only in a few cases , mainly because reliable al@xmath1 measurements are quite rare ( table 1 ) .",
    "for this reason we take advantage of the existence of the @xmath37  @xmath38 and @xmath37  @xmath39 correlations to indirectly estimate @xmath5(al@xmath1 ) from fe@xmath1 and si@xmath1 measurements .",
    "the indirect determinations based on si@xmath1 measurements are displayed in table 1 , column 7 .",
    "references to the original si@xmath1 measurements are the same given in column 6 .",
    "these indirect estimates of @xmath5(al@xmath1 ) yield results consistent with all the available al@xmath1 data ( i.e. , 9 determinations and also 9 lower limits ) .",
    "similar results are obtained when fe@xmath1 is used to track al@xmath1 ( see more details in section 2.4 ) . because the correlation with @xmath5(si@xmath1 ) has lower dispersion , lower slope error , and lower intercept error than the correlation with @xmath5(fe@xmath1 ) ( table 2 )",
    "we use the si@xmath1-based results given in table 1 in the rest of the paper , unless otherwise specified .    in the last column of table 1",
    "we list the values of the aluminium ionization ratio in dlas obtained by using indirect and , when possible , direct measurements of al@xmath1 .",
    "the ionization ratio shows a spread of more than one order of magnitude , with values ranging from @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) @xmath35 0.03 up to @xmath35 0.6 , and a median value @xmath35 0.2 .",
    "values of @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) as high as 0.6 are detected also in the sub - sample for which @xmath5(al@xmath1 ) is measured directly .",
    "the presence of high fractions of doubly ionized aluminium suggests that al@xmath1 is not the only ionization state of aluminium present in significant amounts in dlas .",
    "however , it is unsafe to use @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) , which is a quantity integrated along the line of sight , as an indicator of the local ionization ratio .",
    "in fact , singly and doubly ionized aluminium may arise in distinct regions , in which case @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) would reflect the relative contribution of such regions to the column densities , rather than the local ionization ratio .",
    "the @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) ratio does not show any trend with absorber redshift . in the interval @xmath40 , where most of the measurements are concentrated , the ratio shows the full spread of a factor of 20 .",
    "since metagalactic effects are expected to have a smooth variation with redshift , the large spread in a relatively narrow redshift interval suggests that the ionization fraction is severely influenced by local effects .",
    "the metagalactic radiation field may play a role in determining the ionization balance , but must be modulated by some local effect .",
    "such modulation may result from emission / absorption of radiation internal to the dlas or from large changes in cloud density .",
    "the presence of high fractions of al@xmath0 with same velocity distribution of low - ionization might question the reliability of abundance determinations in dlas .",
    "if abundance measurements are strongly affected by ionization conditions , we would expect that they show some dependence on @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) .",
    "for instance , the models calculations performed in paper ii predict that [ zn / h ] and [ si / h ] measurements @xmath41 - \\log ( { \\rm x } / { \\rm y } ) _ { \\sun}$ ] . ] can be easily overestimated by one order of magnitude when @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) @xmath42 1/10 for the relatively low ionization parameters discussed in that work .",
    "the collection of @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) values presented in table 1 allows us to probe if such effects are indeed present , at least for elements commonly measured in dlas .",
    "we performed a linear regression analysis of [ si / h ] and [ si / fe ] against @xmath43(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) . the [ si / h ] analysis yields correlation coefficient @xmath44 , dispersion @xmath45 , and slope @xmath46 ( 18 data points ) .",
    "the predicted increase of [ si / h ] at high @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) , if present , is not significant from the statistical point of view .",
    "similar results are obtained from the study of [ si / fe ] , a ratio which is expected to be moderately sensitive to ionization effects ( paper ii ) .",
    "the [ si / fe ] analysis yields @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( 19 data points ) . in this case",
    "the null result is even more clear",
    ". the lower dispersion than in the case of the si / h ratio is probably due to the fact that variations of the metallicity and of the dust - to - gas ratio tend to cancel when we consider a relative abundance such as si / fe .",
    "these results suggest that ionization corrections are not severe , or at least that they do not show a strong , obvious dependence on @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) .      in fig .",
    "[ ial&hi ] we plot @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) versus the absorber h@xmath11 column density .",
    "the data points show a general decrease of @xmath43(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) with increasing log@xmath5(h@xmath11 ) .",
    "a linear regression analysis yields an anti - correlation with slope @xmath51 and intercept @xmath52 .",
    "even if the correlation coefficient is not very high ( pearson s @xmath53 ) , the probability of the null hypothesis ( of no correlation ) is @xmath54 .",
    "the highest value of the ratio , @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) @xmath55 , is found at @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) @xmath35 10@xmath56 @xmath13 , while the lowest value , @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) @xmath57 , is found at @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) @xmath35 10@xmath58 @xmath13 .",
    "the above result is based in large part on indirect al@xmath1 determinations obtained from si@xmath1 measurements . however , the @xmath43(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) ",
    "log@xmath5(h@xmath11 ) anti - correlation is confirmed when fe@xmath1 is used to infer al@xmath1 column densities .",
    "in fact , the slope and intercept derived in this case  @xmath59 and @xmath60  are very similar to the above given values , and the probability of the null hypothesis equals @xmath61 .    the lack of dlas at the bottom - left and top - right corners of fig .",
    "[ ial&hi ] could be due , in principle , to the impossibility of detecting al@xmath1 and/or al@xmath0 below their observational limits .",
    "however , we have verified that this is not the case . in fact , the strength of the al@xmath1 167.0 nm transition and of the numerous si@xmath1 and fe@xmath1 transitions used for the indirect al@xmath1 determinations guarantee that al@xmath1 would be easily detected down to much lower column densities than observed . in the case of al@xmath0 ,",
    "the detection limit with keck+hires is @xmath62 @xmath13 . in the sample of table 1 ,",
    "only one case out of 21 measurements has such a low value . of the remaining @xmath5(al@xmath0 )",
    "data , 9 are 0.5 dex above the detection limit and 11 are 1 dex above the limit .",
    "we conclude that the anti - correlation is not an artifact induced by observational limitations .",
    "in addition , we do not have reasons to believe that the observed trend results from a selection bias .",
    "the most common bias considered to affect the population of dlas is dust obscuration of the background qso ( pei et al .",
    "in fact , this effect may be responsible for the apparent anti - correlation between [ zn / h ] and @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) found by boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , if lines of sight of high metallicity ( dust content ) and high column density indeed obscure the background qso .",
    "however , the same effect should not be relevant for the anti - correlation reported here given the fact that the ratio @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) is independent of metallicity .",
    "the existence of an empirical anti - correlation @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) - @xmath43(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) implies that the neutral hydrogen column density can be used as an indirect estimator of the ionization state of the gas . in this way",
    "one can search for ionization effects in dlas without available al measurements .",
    "given the importance of zn in dla studies we searched for a possible dependence of [ cr / zn ] and [ fe / zn ] on @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) .",
    "a linear regression through the 26 [ cr / zn ] measurements available yields a slope @xmath63 and a correlation coefficient @xmath64 .",
    "very similar results are obtained from the analysis of the 22 [ fe / zn ] available determinations : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , there is no trace of an increased dispersion at low @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) for any of the two ratios .",
    "these empirical results suggest that zn ionization effects are probably negligible in dlas",
    ".    if al@xmath0/al@xmath1 is relatively constant throughout the cloud , the @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) ratio should be approximately constant with @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) with @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) can be interpreted in two ways , depending on which of the two possible origins of al@xmath0 mentioned at the end of section 2.1 is more appropriate .",
    "( 1 ) if al@xmath0 is co - spatial with the rest of low - ionization species , the anticorrelation is consistent with a reduction of the gas ionization level with increasing h@xmath11 self - shielding .",
    "( 2 ) if al@xmath0 originates in a partially ionized interface bordering a neutral region , then we expect the column density of the ionized interface and of the neutral region to be unrelated and therefore @xmath5(al@xmath0 ) to be independent of @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) . on the other hand , we expect al@xmath1 and other species of low ionization to scale with h@xmath11 owing to a common origin in the neutral region .",
    "the decrease of @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) with @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) is naturally explained from the fact that @xmath5(al@xmath0 ) does not scale with @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) while @xmath5(al@xmath1 ) does .",
    "on the basis of the observational results discussed above , we consider two possible origins for species of low and intermediate ionization : ( 1 ) regions completely opaque to photons with @xmath36ev and/or ( 2 ) regions partially transparent to ionizing photons .",
    "neutral and singly ionized species can arise in both regions , but al@xmath0 can only be present in type-2 regions .",
    "the general idea is that type-2 regions are the photoionized envelopes of type-1 regions .",
    "the similarity of the velocity profiles of al@xmath0 and singly ionized species is naturally explained in this way . on the other hand ,",
    "radial - velocity studies show a general misalignment of c@xmath20 and si@xmath20 profiles relative to al@xmath0 profiles , suggesting that the bulk of high - ionization species originates elsewhere ( wolfe & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "we expect therefore that type-2 regions are mildly ionized and have low si@xmath20/si@xmath1 fraction .    in the appendix",
    "we derive the expressions that allow us to compute ionization ratios and abundance ionization corrections in the framework of the two - region model .",
    "these expressions do not depend on the metallicity , provided type-1 and type-2 regions have equal metallicity in any given dla system .",
    "the relative contribution of the two regions along the line of sight is specified by the parameter @xmath67 , which is the ratio of the total column densities in region 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the possibility that al@xmath0 and the species of low ionization originate together in a single layer is included in our treatment as the special case @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , the single layer should be a partially ionized region of type 2 given the presence of significant fractions of al@xmath0 .    in order to model the ionization properties of the gas we assume that the dla regions under study are embedded in a ionizing radiation field of given spectrum and intensity . in type-1 regions",
    "we only consider the contribution of species which are dominant ionization states in hi regions . in type-2 regions",
    "we compute the ionization fractions by means of photoionization equilibrium calculations .",
    "for this purpose we used the cloudy code ( v90.04 ; ferland 1996 , ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) assuming plane - parallel geometry with ionizing radiation incident on one side .",
    "we consider two possible types of radiation fields : a hard , qso - dominated spectrum representative of the radiation field external to the dlas at @xmath69 ( haardt & madau 1996 ; madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) and a soft , stellar - type spectrum ( @xmath70=33,000 k ; kurucz 1991 ) representative of the internal radiation field or of an external field dominated by starlight from galaxies ( e.g. steidel , pettini & adelberger 2000 ) . in both cases",
    "the intensity of the field is specified by the ionization parameter @xmath71 , where @xmath72(h ) is the total surface flux of ionizing photons ( @xmath13 s@xmath73 ) and @xmath74 the hydrogen particle density ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we refer to paper ii for more details on the model assumptions and on the adopted radiation fields . in the rest of this section we present model predictions of the ionization ratios @xmath76(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) and of the abundance ionization corrections .",
    "the photoionization calculations indicate that with the soft , stellar - type spectrum the h@xmath11 column density of the ionized layer , @xmath77(h@xmath11 ) , can not attain the high values typical of dlas for a wide range of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath77(h@xmath11 ) @xmath79 @xmath13 for @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we assume that a neutral region of type 1 is present along the line of sight , in addition to the al@xmath0-bearing , type-2 region .",
    "we refer to this soft - continuum , two - regions model as s2 .    because the ionized region does not yield a significant contribution to the neutral hydrogen column density and because @xmath81 in the neutral region , we take @xmath82(h ) = @xmath83= @xmath84 as the total column density of the type-1 region , where @xmath84 covers the interval @xmath85 @xmath13 @xmath86 @xmath13 , representative of dlas . for each given @xmath82(h ) we let the ionization parameter @xmath78 vary and we use cloudy to determine the column density of the type-2 region , @xmath77(h ) , and the mean ionization fractions of the species of interest .",
    "we then estimate @xmath76(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) by means of eq .",
    "[ aluminiumratio2 ] , where we take @xmath87(h)/@xmath77(h ) and we insert the al@xmath1 and al@xmath0 ionization fractions . in this way we derive model curves of @xmath76(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) versus @xmath5(h@xmath11 ) that can be compared with the observed data points .    in fig .",
    "[ ialhimoda ] we show the results of these calculations for constant values of the ionization parameter .",
    "the solutions calculated at @xmath88 ( thick curve ) are consistent , within the statistical errors , with the linear regression of the observational data points ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the corresponding total hydrogen column density of the type-2 layer predicted by the model is @xmath77(h ) @xmath89 @xmath13 .",

    "the total column densities of type-1 and type-2 regions are roughly comparable ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) - @xmath9(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) anticorrelation can be easily modeled with very simple assumptions and with a single interval of @xmath78 values in the framework of the s2 model .      with the qso - dominated field",

    "in particular we have considered the possibility , consistent with available data , that the al@xmath18 dielectronic recombination rate may be overestimated .",
    "we find that in this case the ionization parameter @xmath78 and the abundance corrections would be lower both in the s2 and in the h1 model .",
    "the ionization corrections presented here are significantly smaller than the ones predicted by izotov , schaerer & charbonnel ( 2000 ) , who have also considered a two - region model of dla gas .",
    "however , these authors assume that the neutral region has much lower metallicity than the ionized one , a strong assumption for which there is little observational support ( see levshakov , kegel & agafonova , 2000 ) . with such assumption",
    "the metal absorptions originate essentially in the ionized region and the predicted ionization effects are obviously more enhanced than in our case .",
    "future studies of ionization properties in dlas would benefit from measurements of ionic ratios other than al@xmath0/al@xmath1 .",
    "one possibility is the fe@xmath0/fe@xmath1 given the presence of the 112.2 nm transition of fe@xmath0 which could be observed in selected cases . from the point of view of the atomic data it is important to better understand the actual accuracy of atomic parameters , and in particular those of al and zn .",

    "we thank the referee for suggestions that have significantly improved the quality of this work .",
    "we assume that low ionization species in dlas arise in two type of regions : ( 1 ) an h@xmath11 region completely opaque to ionizing photons with @xmath36ev and ( 2 ) a mildly ionized region containing intermediate - ionization species such as al@xmath0 , but not high ions such as c@xmath20 or si@xmath20 .",
    "the observed column density of the @xmath153-th ionization state of the element x is given by the relation @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 indicates the neutral and ionized region , respectively ; the integrals are carried on along the portions of line of sight @xmath157 through the two regions ; @xmath158 is the local density ( atoms @xmath75 ) of x summed over all the possible ionization states @xmath153 ; @xmath159(x@xmath160 ) = @xmath161(x@xmath160)/ @xmath162 is the ionization fraction of the @xmath153-th state ; @xmath163(x ) = @xmath161(x)/@xmath161(h ) is the absolute abundance of x.    we assume that type-1 and type-2 regions have equal abundances in a given dla system : @xmath164 . for the dominant ionization state in the type-1 region ,",
    "@xmath165 , we have @xmath166 and , in particular , @xmath167(h@xmath11 ) = 1 . from these assumptions and from ( [ relation1 ] ) we can express the intrinsic abundance ratio of two elements x and y in terms of the column density ratio of the dominant species @xmath168 where @xmath169 is , by definition , the ionization correction factor and @xmath170 the mean hydrogen density in the h@xmath11 region .",
    "it is easy to obtain similar a expression for the correction term of absolute abundances , @xmath171 , by replacing @xmath172 with @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ cxy ] ) .",
    "we can also derive the column density ratio between two ionization states of a given element .",
    "in particular we are interested in comparing the ionization state which is dominant in the neutral region , @xmath174 , with higher ionization states , @xmath175 .",
    "since @xmath176 and @xmath166 we obtain from ( [ relation1 ] ) @xmath177    we can derive simpler expressions by introducing the average ionization fractions along the line of sight , @xmath178 . with this definition we obtain@xmath179 @xmath180 and @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the fraction of the line - of - sight total hydrogen column densities in the two regions .",
    "the mean ionization fractions @xmath183 can be estimated by modeling the intensity and spectrum of the ionizing radiation field in which the clouds are embedded .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 plays a central role in assessing the importance of ionization effects .",
    "when @xmath184 the ionization corrections are negligible since @xmath185 and @xmath186 . in this case the ionization ratio @xmath187 tends to be very low no matter which are the conditions in the ionized envelope . on the other hand , if @xmath188 , the ionization corrections and the ionization ratio are representative of the ionized envelope and not of the neutral region .",
    "this latter case is appropriate when we consider that all species of low and intermediate ionization state originate in a single , partially ionized layer .",

    "<S> we find good correlations @xmath6 - @xmath7 and @xmath6 - @xmath8 that we use to indirectly estimate @xmath5(al@xmath1 ) from @xmath5(si@xmath1 ) and/or @xmath5(fe@xmath1 ) measurements . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we determine the ratio @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) for a sample of 20 dlas . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to common belief , the ratio can attain relatively high values ( up to 0.6 ) , suggesting that gas of intermediate ionization state plays an important role in dlas . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the lack of any trend between abundance ratios , such as si / h and si / fe , and @xmath3(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) indicates that abundances are not severely influenced by ionization effects . </S>",

    "<S> - @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) anticorrelation that we use , in conjunction with idealized photoionization equilibrium calculations , to constrain the ionization properties and to predict ionization corrections in dlas . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two possible origins for the species of low and intermediate ionization state : ( 1 ) neutral regions devoid of al@xmath0 and/or ( 2 ) partially ionized , al@xmath0-bearing regions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9(al@xmath0/al@xmath1 ) - @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) anticorrelation can be naturally explained in terms of a two - region model with a soft , stellar - type ionizing radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> we present abundance ionization corrections for 14 elements of astrophysical interest derived with different types of ionizing spectra . for most of these elements the corrections are generally below measurements errors , contrary to the predictions of recent models presented in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the potential effects of inaccuracies of the al recombination rates used in the photoionization calculations . </S>"
