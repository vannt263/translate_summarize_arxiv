    "<S> we study the radial schroedinger equation for a particle of mass m in the field of a singular attractive @xmath0 potential with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this potential is relevant to the fabrication of nanoscale atom optical devices , is said to be the potential describing the dipole - bound anions of polar molecules , and is the effective potential underlying the universal behavior of three - body systems in nuclear physics and atomic physics , including aspects of bose - einstein condensates , first described by efimov . </S>",
    "<S> new results in three - body physical systems motivate the present investigation . using the regularization method of beane et al . </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the corresponding `` renormalization group flow '' equation can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it exhibits a limit cycle behavior and has infinitely many branches . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a physical meaning for self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian arises naturally in this framework .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we study the regularization and renormalization of the singular attractive @xmath0 potential , a problem motivated , in part , by recent results in three - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , there has been renewed interest in the non - relativistic three - body system with short - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the current investigations are stimulated by the promise that effective field theories ( eft s ) offer a systematic and model - independent treatment of atomic , nuclear and hadronic physics at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a low - energy system with a clear - cut separation of distance scales can be described by an eft involving explicitly only the long - wavelength degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the short - range dynamics can be treated as a set of local operators which correspond to delta - function interactions in coordinate space . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the short distance physics can not be of importance to the low energy aspects of the system ; if they are , it is an indication of a need for renormalization of the eft .    </S>",
    "<S> such a renormalization of an eft of a three - body system with delta - function two - body interactions @xcite has lead to the rediscovery of the one - parameter contact three - body interaction shown to restore the lower bound of this three - body hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( here we mention that the unboundedness of the hamiltonian from below is interpreted in eft s as the onset of short - distance physics whose effect must be included in local counterterms @xcite ; hence the three - body counterterm in the eft equations for 3-body systems , both bound and scattering states @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the three - body counterterm exhibits a convergence of the renormalization group flow to one - dimensional limit cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this was earlier proved in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a mathematical analysis of the efimov effect which occurs in bound 3-body systems when more than one of the two - body subsystems has a zero energy resonance @xcite . the presumed novelty of a renormalization group flow with a limit cycle has inspired additional recent work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as the applications of eft s continue @xcite , it will be important to understand how to explicitly renormalize higher orders in an eft . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a renormalized equation for two - nucleon systems with explicit pion - exchange would be of great potential value . </S>",
    "<S> pion exchange gives rise to a singular @xmath2 potential and the questions arise : can the resummation of pion graphs be renormalized by a single local operator ? </S>",
    "<S> would this operator exhibit a limit cycle as does the three - body contact operator in the pion - less three - nucleon eft ? </S>",
    "<S> could one calculate the evolution of such an operator analytically ? </S>",
    "<S> a positive answer to the last question would help future numerical work with eft s . </S>",
    "<S> already , the short distance physics of the @xmath3 coupled channels of the single pion exchange potential has been renormalized by a short range four - nucleon counterterm using the method introduced in ref.[3 ] , but the treatment was numerical and these questions were not addressed in that investigation @xcite    such questions , coupled with the interesting limit cycle behavior found in the three - body system , have prompted investigations of the renormalization group behavior of the short range counterterms which serve to regularize given long range potentials ( including singular potentials ) in the two - body schroedinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> since these long range potentials are often singular at the origin , it has been argued that the short range interaction should not be represented by a 3-dimensional delta - function at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> birse et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite choose a delta - shell potential and beane et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest that a simple attractive square well represents a `` smeared out '' delta - function potential . </S>",
    "<S> in either case , it is said , the details of the short distance regularization should not matter ; the low energy aspects of the system should be invariant in the same way under suitable changes of the short range potential .    for completeness , we list other regularization and renormalization schemes which do not follow from the separation of scales of an etf , but </S>",
    "<S> also have been applied to the inverse square potential description of physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of a neutral atom interacting with a charged wire @xcite , relevant to the development of nanoscale atom optical devices , has been treated with the method of self - adjoint extensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a short distance cutoff scheme which renormalizes the strength of the @xmath4 potential , yields a critical dipole moment that has been confronted with the experimental capture of electrons by dipole molecules and formation of anions as an example of quantum mechanical symmetry breaking @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these alternative regularizations are not the subject of our present investigation .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we follow the regularization method of beane et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to obtain analytically the renormalization group behavior of the coupling constant of the short range attractive square well they use to regularize the long range inverse square potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 potential is on the boundary between singular and regular potentials and thus does or does not require a self - adjoint extension , depending on the strength of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> more interesting from the eft point of view is the efimov observation @xcite that the low energy behavior of three - body systems is determined by a long range three - body effective interaction of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is built from the relative distances between the particles . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two - body inverse square potential is the analogue to the interaction in a three - body system in the limit of zero energy resonance ( and infinite two - body scattering lengths ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a further advantage of our analytic approach to the `` eft style '' renormalization of the inverse square potential is that we can then more readily make contact with the mathematically rigorous and well studied approach to regularization via self - adjoint extensions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of self - adjoint extensions of hamiltonians underlies the first discussions of limit cycle behavior in three - body systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the self - adjoint extensions of the inverse square potential are well known @xcite and can be compared with the results of our study , which we now begin .    the starting point of our study is the @xmath8wave reduced radial schroedinger equation for one particle of mass @xmath9 in the external potential @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath10 is given by @xcite : @xmath12 that is , the long range attractive @xmath13 second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) is cutoff at a short distance radius @xmath7 by an attractive square well . as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we first solve eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) for the zero energy solution @xmath14 @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the zero energy phase @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is an arbitrary scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the usual matching condition of the wave function and its derivative at @xmath21 then yields : @xmath22 following @xcite we now consider eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) to be a transcendental equation _ defining _ the value of the short range coupling constant @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is of the form @xmath24 and can be solved exactly in closed form using a method based upon the solution to the riemann problem in complex variable analysis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution to eq.([trans ] ) then turns out to be @xcite : @xmath25 where : @xmath26 formula ( 9 ) does not restrict @xmath27 to be positive , so that all the solutions that we consider follow from the positive branch of ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we interpret eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) to be an equation for the running coupling constant @xmath28 , this amounts to requiring that @xmath29 must be defined for all values of @xmath30 except for those points where @xmath27 ( or its inverse ) vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this is potentially important when comparing our analytic solution with _ </S>",
    "<S> numerical _ solutions to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> numerical investigations in general will mix solutions that only exist in a limited range of @xmath30-values ( @xmath31 in eq.(6 ) ) with solutions ( @xmath32 in eq.(7 ) ) which we consider to be the only physically relevant solutions . from now on , we shall therefore use @xmath29 to mean only a solution of eq . ( 7 ) , and suppress the subscript @xmath33 when it is not needed for the discussion . </S>",
    "<S> we then find from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) has infinitely many roots , in agreement with @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted @xmath29 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) as a function of @xmath34 @xmath35 for fixed @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in figures 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the long range potential @xmath13 increases with succeeding figures ; @xmath38 in fig . 1 , @xmath39 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the running coupling @xmath40 exhibits a limit cycle behavior for all values of @xmath41 ; the period becomes smaller as the strength of the attractive @xmath13 potential increases , according to the argument ( @xmath42 ) of the tangent function in the source term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior described by @xmath40 , for large enough @xmath43 , is of a  sawtooth \" type , with a periodic sharp increase of the value of the coupling constant with decreasing values of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` increase '' is actually a genuine discontinuity of @xmath29 at the zeros of @xmath44 and must be a multiple of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a discontinuity can only occur at a zero of @xmath46 in order that @xmath47 be continuous at all points where @xmath44 is a continuous function . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath29 has reached the smallest positive zero ( @xmath48 , for some @xmath49value , it increases by @xmath45 as @xmath50 is further decreased . </S>",
    "<S> altering the zero energy phase shift @xmath51 from 0 through 2 ( and keeping n=1 and @xmath52 ) does not qualitatively change the appearance of the pattern of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 : the discontinuity moves to lower @xmath50 , but the magnitude of the discontinuity remains the same multiple of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can be traced to the periodicity of the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) with respect to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the branches which correspond to roots with @xmath54 are qualitatively similar to fig 2 . , but the slow fall - off with decreasing @xmath50 seen in fig . 2 increases and the  saw - tooth \" appearance becomes more of a rounded off square wave . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of the solutions is illustrated by fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 which plots @xmath29 for the same strength and initial phase @xmath52 , @xmath55 as fig . 2 , but </S>",
    "<S> n has increased to 16 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the discontinuity of this @xmath56 remains @xmath45 , however .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we plot as fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the analytical solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) for the values @xmath57 , @xmath58 to compare with the numerical solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) , with the same input , displayed in figure 1 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter numerical solution is in excellent agreement with the analytical solution presented here , if one allows a solution to go from a higher branch ( @xmath59 ) to the next lower branch ( @xmath37 ) as it crosses a zero of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as discussed above and shown on fig.4 , @xmath61 itself must ultimately increase by @xmath45 after reaching its lowest value @xmath62 , thus exhibiting a limit cycle behavior of the solution.it is evident that the limit cycle behavior of the solutions of equation ( 5 ) is a consequence of the requirement that a solution @xmath63 be defined for all values of @xmath64 for which omega or its inverse is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement _ includes solutions for @xmath65 _ and therefore corresponds to our understanding of the emulation proposed in ref [ 3 ] of the contact term which encapsulates the short range dynamics of an eft . from figures 1 - 3 , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the limit cycle behavior of a given branch continues to the left as @xmath65 and lnx becomes arbitrarily small . </S>",
    "<S> consider , however , the behavior for small @xmath7 of a numerical solution of ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 ] , shown in figure 4 which segues smoothly between different branches of the analytic solutions of equation ( 5 ) as it crosses a zero of @xmath60 . for some value of negative ln x , as </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 becomes arbitrarily small , the numerical solution must pass to the @xmath66 solution . </S>",
    "<S> but , as we have noted , this solution exists for only a limited range of @xmath64 values . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two numerical solutions of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 would appear to not be defined for arbitrarily small @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> one could , however , choose another numerical solution corresponding to a higher value of @xmath33 which does not pass to @xmath66 on the way from large to arbitrarily small @xmath64 and avoid this problem . </S>",
    "<S> this exercise need not be performed , however , with our requirement of a well defined solution for all values of @xmath64 for which omega or its inverse is nonzero .    a motivation for both the study of ref . @xcite and the present discussion is the expectation that the two - body inverse square potential is the analogue to the interaction in a three - body system in the limit of zero energy resonances . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the approximate solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) displayed in eq . </S>",
    "<S> 8 of @xcite is quite similar to the equation which describes the running of the three - body counterterm of the pion - less three - nucleon eft s of refs . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both equations have poles and the three - body counterterm seems to reach arbitrarily high values . </S>",
    "<S> we , to the contrary , find no poles in the analytic solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , no evidence of multiple branches was found in the renormalized pion - less three - nucleon problem . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of short distance physics in these two problems needs more understanding in light of the results of efimov  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath67 for @xmath36 , @xmath68 , @xmath37 ]     as a function of @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath39 , @xmath37 ]     as a function of @xmath70 for @xmath36 , @xmath72     as a function of @xmath70 for @xmath58 , @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> the three branches , from bottom to top , correspond to n=1 ( dash - dotted curve ) , n=2 ( dotted curve ) and n=3 ( solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in the text , the discontinuity in @xmath40 is always @xmath53 for each curve . </S>",
    "<S> the two thicker curves are two numerical solutions for the same parameters taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 ] , as discussed in the text . </S>",
    "<S> ]    now we turn to the bound state aspects of the related two problems ( three - body system with contact potentials and the @xmath4 singular potential ) and again find discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> first we show that the regularization method that was used to solve the schroedinger equation ( 1 ) with potential ( 2 ) amounts to specifying a particular self - adjoint extension in case s solution of the bound state ( b.s . ) </S>",
    "<S> spectrum of the attractive singular @xmath74 potential  @xcite . in order to do this , we note that the b.s . </S>",
    "<S> wavefunction that solves eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1)-(2 ) is given by :    @xmath75    where : @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are constants .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath79 , the matching condition now gives ( one still has @xmath80 in that limit ) : @xmath81 where we have used eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trans ] ) together with the small - r behavior of @xmath82 @xcite : @xmath83    the spectrum given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ case ] ) is essentially the spectrum given by case @xcite , where case s arbitrary phase ( which fixes the self - adjoint extension ) @xmath84 is now given by :    @xmath85    it is important to note that the binding energy @xmath86 , after this regularization , no longer depends on the cut - off radius @xmath7 ( for @xmath87 ) but instead on the arbitrary scale @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fixing the zero energy phase of the wavefunction @xmath51 removes the cut - off dependence of the b.s . </S>",
    "<S> spectrum for @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> our result explicitly shows that the physical interpretation of the phase characterizing the self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian indeed can be found from a renormalization of the short - range coupling constant in the regularization method described in ref . @xcite . by the same token </S>",
    "<S> , it illustrates why a cut - off method with a constant strength fails @xcite to provide a physical meaning for this arbitrary phase .    </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the ground state of the @xmath4 potential remains at negative infinity , and no renormalization of the bound state spectrum has been achieved . </S>",
    "<S> contrast this result of the eft style renormalization of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the restoration of the lower bound of the pion - less three - body problem obtained in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a clue to this discrepancy may lie in the distinction between the contact interaction used in ref . 2 and the  eft \" type @xcite regularization of the conventional 3-dimensional delta function . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the attractive square well in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) does not provide a unique way of regularizing ( `` smearing out '' ) a 3-dimensional delta function , and its limit when @xmath88 is not the contact interaction discussed in ref . 2 and 14 . </S>",
    "<S> in that respect , it would be quite interesting to reexamine the solution of the schroedinger equation with a singular @xmath13 potential in conjunction with local realizations of the contact interaction of ref . </S>",
    "<S> 14 implemented by kruppa , varga and revai  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a study might throw additional light on the corresponding renormalization group flow properties in the 3-body problem . </S>"
