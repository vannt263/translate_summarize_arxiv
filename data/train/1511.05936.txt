    "<S> accelerating particles to relativistic energies over very short distances using lasers has been a long standing goal in physics . among the various schemes proposed for electrons , </S>",
    "<S> vacuum laser acceleration has attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of its appealing simplicity : electrons interact with an intense laser field in vacuum and can be continuously accelerated , provided they remain at a given phase of the field until they escape the laser beam . but demonstrating this effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging , as it imposes stringent requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field . here , we solve this long - standing experimental problem for the first time by using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field , and obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration . with the advent of petawatt class lasers , </S>",
    "<S> this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high charge ( nc ) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams .    </S>",
    "<S> femtosecond lasers currently achieve light intensities at focus that far exceed @xmath0 at near infrared wavelengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the great prospects of these extreme intensities is the laser - driven acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies within very short distances . at present , </S>",
    "<S> the most advanced scheme consists of using ultraintense laser pulses to excite large amplitude wakefields in underdense plasmas , providing extremely high accelerating gradients in the order of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , over the past decades , the direct acceleration of electrons by light _ in vacuum _ has also attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations have been driven by the fundamental interest of this most elementary interaction , and by its potential for extreme electron acceleration through electric fields of @xmath2 s tv / m that ultraintense laser pulses provide .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying idea is to inject free electrons into an ultraintense laser field so that they always remain within a given half optical cycle of the field , where they constantly gain energy until they leave the focal volume . </S>",
    "<S> 1d analytical calculations @xcite show that for relativistic electrons , the _ maximum _ energy gain from this process is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron initial lorentz factor , and @xmath5 is the normalized laser vector potential , @xmath6 the electron mass , and @xmath7 the vacuum light velocity . reaching high energy gains thus requires high initial energies @xmath8 and/or ultrahigh laser amplitudes ( @xmath9 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the large body of theoretical work published on this vacuum laser acceleration ( vla ) of electrons to relativistic energies , experimental observations have largely remained elusive @xcite -sometimes even controversial @xcite- and have so far not demonstrated significant energy gains . </S>",
    "<S> this is because vla occurs efficiently only for electrons injected in the laser field with specific initial conditions that are extremely challenging to fulfill experimentally @xcite . indeed , in order to stay in phase with the laser field </S>",
    "<S> , electrons need to have initial velocities close to @xmath7 along the laser propagation axis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they should start interacting with the intense laser beam already close to its spatial and temporal maxima , and even be injected at appropriate phases of this field .    </S>",
    "<S> electrons that do not satisfy these stringent requirements tend to explore many different optical cycles as they interact with the laser field , leading to an oscillatory motion where they are successively accelerated and decelerated , so that their final energy gain is low . </S>",
    "<S> when averaged over several cycles , this typically results in a drift motion where electrons are isotropically expelled away from high intensity regions , an effect which can be accounted for by the relativistic ponderomotive force @xcite .    here , we present clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration of bunches of @xmath10 electrons , corresponding to charges in the nc range , up to relativistic energies around 10 mev . our experimental results clearly discriminate for the first time electrons that have experienced a quasi - monotonic sub - laser - cycle acceleration , from those whose dynamics </S>",
    "<S> has mostly been determined by ponderomotive scattering . to solve the long - standing experimental problem of electron injection in the laser field , we demonstrate a new approach based on the use of _ plasma mirrors _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that specularly reflect ultraintense laser fields while simultaneously injecting relativistic electrons in the core of these reflected fields , co - linearly to the propagation direction .      </S>",
    "<S> plasma mirrors are dense plasmas resulting from the ionization of initially - solid targets irradiated by intense femtosecond laser pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since their density is comparable to the initial solid density ( @xmath11 electrons@xmath12 ) , their reflectivity can be as high as @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an essential feature of plasma mirrors is that to a large extent they behave like ordinary mirrors : the laser field is specularly reflected with hardly any alteration of its spatial properties @xcite , even at extremely high laser intensities . </S>",
    "<S> this is because plasma expansion is very limited on subpicosecond time scales : the plasma - vacuum interface remains optically flat ( flatness @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the laser wavelength ) while the femtosecond laser pulse reflects , thus leaving the beam wavefront essentially unaffected . due to these remarkable properties , plasma mirrors are now largely used in ultrafast optics as a single - shot high - intensity optical device , e.g. to improve temporal contrast of femtosecond pulses @xcite , for the tight focusing of ultraintense beams @xcite , or for the generation of high - order harmonics and attosecond pulses @xcite .    upon reflection on a plasma mirror </S>",
    "<S> , an ultraintense laser pulse can also expel relativistic electrons in a direction close to the specular angle , as seen in particle in cell simulations ( pic ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the key idea of this work is that plasma mirrors can be used as electron injectors in the reflected laser field , providing a simple experimental solution to study the interaction of free electrons with intense lasers in vacuum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are emitted at given phases of the laser field @xcite as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) and then interact with this field in vacuum over the rayleigh length , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> although there have been some observations of electron ejection from solid surfaces @xcite , the experimental parameters did not permit to reach the vla regime we have identified in this work , the intensity being too low ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) or the gradient scale length too long .      </S>",
    "<S> our experiment consisted in measuring the spatial profile of electron beams emitted by plasma mirrors exposed to ultraintense laser pulses , as well as their energy distributions at different emission angles . </S>",
    "<S> it was performed on the uhi100 laser of cea / iramis , a @xmath18 laser system that delivers @xmath19 , @xmath20 pulses . once their temporal contrast is improved by 4 orders of magnitude with a plasma - based temporal filtering system @xcite , the laser pulses are focused on a flat fused silica target with an incidence angle of @xmath21 and in @xmath22-polarization , at a peak intensity of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the focal spot is @xmath25 at fwhm and the rayleigh length is about @xmath26 . to optimize the electron signal , </S>",
    "<S> the scale length of the plasma density gradient at the surface was accurately controlled by pre - ionizing the target with a weaker prepulse ( @xmath27 ) at an adjustable delay of a few hundreds femtoseconds before the main pulse @xcite ( see suppl . info . </S>",
    "<S> for the full data ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electron beam spatial profile was measured using a lanex phosphor screen placed @xmath28 away from the target , perpendicularly to the specular direction , imaged on a ccd camera . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic spectrometer can be inserted before this lanex screen in order to measure the electron energy distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical electron angular distribution is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> . the measured electron emission spreads over a broad cone of @xmath29 angular width , but is spatially very inhomogeneous within this cone . </S>",
    "<S> a pronounced hole is observed around the propagation direction of the reflected beam , with a cylindrical symmetry around this axis . </S>",
    "<S> the total angular width of this hole is about @xmath30 , comparable to the divergence of the reflected beam . </S>",
    "<S> the other dominant feature is a bright electron peak on one edge of this hole , along the direction of the laser polarization ( horizontal axis in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) and located between the specular and the normal direction . </S>",
    "<S> its divergence is about @xmath31 , much smaller than that of the total electron beam . from the signal measured on the calibrated lanex screen @xcite , the overall charge in the electron beam is about @xmath32 , with @xmath33 within the bright spot . </S>",
    "<S> note that these patterns were clearly observed at high intensity @xmath34 and optimized for gradient scale lengths of @xmath35 ( see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> info . ) .    figure  [ fig2]b shows the spatially - resolved electron spectra measured at two different locations in the beam , on opposite sides of the hole along the laser polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> broad peaked spectra are observed , with a central energy of a few mev . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature here is that the central energy is two times higher in the bright electron peak ( 10 mev ) than on the opposite side of the hole ( 5 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in energy suggests a straightforward interpretation for the spatial pattern of the electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> the bright peak along the laser polarization could correspond to electrons which have gained energy by vla due to appropriate injection conditions in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the other electrons in the beam would have experienced isotropic ponderomotive scattering , leading to the symmetrical hole around the laser axis . </S>",
    "<S> we now validate this interpretation , by first studying the conditions of injection of electrons from plasma mirrors into the vacuum , and then their subsequent dynamics in the reflected field .      given the complexity of the coupling between intense laser fields and plasma mirrors , we turn to particle in cell ( pic ) simulations to determine the properties of electrons ejected in the vacuum . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) shows the density of ejected electrons as a function of time , together with the waveform @xmath36 of the reflected field for interaction conditions corresponding to our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities were both sampled very close to the plasma mirror surface ( @xmath37 ) , when electrons escape the plasma and are injected into the vacuum in the core of the reflected field . </S>",
    "<S> electrons are observed to be emitted in the form of attosecond bunches at very precise phases close to the nodes of the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the waveform of the reflected field is distorted upon reflection , and strongly deviates from a pure sine wave . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the generation of high - order harmonics of the laser frequency on the plasma mirror @xcite , which is unavoidable at these intensities in @xmath22-polarization . while this can quantitatively affect the exact outcome of the subsequent laser - electron interaction in vacuum </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that this does not qualitatively alter the involved physics . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3]b ) shows the momentum distributions of these electrons right after their ejection , along the specular direction ( @xmath38 ) and along the laser polarization direction ( @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> electrons start their motion in vacuum with relativistic velocities , corresponding to an average energy of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , and are ejected with an average angle of @xmath42 away from the specular direction .    </S>",
    "<S> these initial conditions are close to being ideal for the observation of vla , and definitely much more favorable than those achieved in all previous experimental attempts to observe this effect @xcite . in experiments based on electron injection by ionization of core atomic levels </S>",
    "<S> , electrons started the interaction at rest and could not reach relativistic energies @xcite . in those relying on electron beams produced by conventional accelerators , combined with an intense laser through a drilled mirror , the phase of injection in the field covers a full optical period , so that only a very small fraction of the electrons actually gains energy by vla @xcite .    to study the subsequent interaction of these electrons with the laser field in vacuum , we turn to a simple 3d test particle model , similar to the one used in @xcite ( see methods ) . in this model , the relativistic equations of motion are solved for electrons injected in a sinusoidal laser field , assumed to be gaussian in space and time , and known analytically at every time and position . </S>",
    "<S> this is computationally much less demanding than the 3d pic simulations that would be required to account for the isotropic effect of the ponderomotive force .    using this model , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the trajectories of millions of electrons injected in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the set of initial conditions for these electrons is derived from the output of pic simulations , such as those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( see methods ) . figure  [ fig2]c ) shows the angular electron distribution obtained from these simulations , for physical conditions corresponding to our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of this distribution with the experimental one is striking : the two main features observed in the experiment -the hole around the laser axis and the bright peak along the laser polarization- are both well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the final energy spectra calculated on each side of the hole are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d ) and also compare well with the experimental observations . despite its simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , this model thus captures the essential physics of the interaction in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that effects such as space charge or the non - sinusoidal waveform of the reflected field , not taken into account in these simulations , do not play a major role once electrons are in vacuum .      considering this good agreement , this 3d model can now be exploited to analyze the trajectories of electrons contributing to the different patterns observed in the electron beam . to this end , we sort the electrons into different groups , depending on the number of laser optical cycles @xmath43 that they have crossed along their trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing electrons that experienced vacuum laser acceleration , from those that were scattered by the ponderomotive force . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) which shows two trajectories @xmath44 , representative of these two regimes : @xmath45 ( full line ) and @xmath46 ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding temporal evolutions of the electron lorentz factor is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) .    in the first case , </S>",
    "<S> the `` vla electron '' does not oscillate in the field , but rather `` surfs '' the laser wavefront in which it was injected , along the polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> it thus gains energy almost all along its trajectory , until it escapes the focal volume sideways after an interaction distance of the order of the rayleigh length . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the `` ponderomotive electron '' oscillates as it explores several optical cycles of the laser field , and gets quickly expelled out of the laser beam with a low energy gain -akin to a surfer that has missed the wave .    in practice , there is a continuous transition between these two extreme types of trajectories , depending on the exact electron injection conditions in the field . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the images in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) showing the beam patterns produced by several sub - ensembles of electrons in the simulations , corresponding to @xmath43 varying from @xmath47 ( vla electrons ) to @xmath48 ( ponderomotive electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> ponderomotive electrons form a doughnut - shaped beam centered on the laser propagation axis , while vla electrons tend to concentrate in a bright peak on the edge of the ponderomotive hole , along the polarization direction .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis confirms our interpretation of the electron beam patterns observed in experiments , and provides clear proof that the bright peak in these patterns is due to vla . according to our simulations </S>",
    "<S> , these electrons are accelerated from 1.5 mev to 10 mev ( fig . [ fig2]d ) ) over a distance of less than 100 @xmath49 , corresponding to an energy gain by vla of about 7 in this experiment . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , a remarkable feature of vla is that the position of the peak in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) depends on the phase of injection of electrons in the laser field : if we artificially vary this phase by @xmath50 ( half a laser period ) in the simulation , this bright spot shifts to the other side of the ponderomotive hole . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of this peak _ on one side only _ of the hole is thus a clear indication that electrons are ejected out of the plasma mirror at a specific phase of the laser field , in the form of sub - laser cycle ( attosecond ) bunches .      </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the first unambiguous experimental evidence of vla of relativistic electrons by ultraintense laser fields , using a new concept for injecting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this simple scheme , based on the remarkable properties of plasma mirrors , is flexible and can , in principle , be extended to much higher laser intensities and to more complex laser beams . from a fundamental point of view , it opens the way to the extensive experimental investigation of the interaction of free electrons with ultraintense lasers in various experimental conditions . using pw - class lasers and intensities in excess of @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> , electrons could be exposed to accelerating gradients approaching 100 tv / m over tens of microns , and should thus reach energies in the gev range @xcite , making vla a promising scheme for the production of high charge ( nc ) ultra - relativistic beams . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , spatial shaping of the laser beam , providing doughnut beam shapes , as in radially polarized laser beams @xcite or laguerre - gauss beams @xcite , has the potential to further improve the beam quality and to provide more collimated electron beams . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , temporal shaping of the field through the use of two - color lasers @xcite could also be a path toward the sub - cycle control of the injection phase in the laser field . </S>"
