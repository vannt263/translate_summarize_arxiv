    "quantum discord @xcite as a measure of the quantumness of correlations has lead to revaluation of the advantage of quantum systems which are affected by decoherence .",
    "numerous are the quantum protocols which can be performed with quantum discord @xcite instead of entanglement @xcite . as a measure of non - classical correlation , quantum discord is also recognized as a fundamental property of quantum systems @xcite . although the definition of quantum discord is conceptually clear , computing it has been difficult since it requires the optimization over all possible measurements on one qubit .",
    "the most general class of quantum states for which quantum discord can be studied analytically has been shown to be the @xmath0 states @xcite . @xmath0-states@xcite",
    "are encountered frequently in different contexts of physics@xcite .",
    "although there have been a few methods for finding analytical results for two - qubit @xmath0-states @xcite they are not always correct .",
    "extensive numerical studies have shown that the two known analytical formulas are not always valid and errors exist in the calculation of quantum discord with such formulas @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the most general form of @xmath0-states and we find that the quantum discord for the majority of the states can be calculated with two closed form formulas .",
    "we also determine analytically the criteria for these formulas to be valid and the solution for the rare cases where the two formulas are not valid .",
    "this provides a way to calculate the quantum discord for any @xmath0-states without performing the optimization process .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec 2 ] we introduce the definition of quantum discord @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec 3 ] we discuss the derivation of our formalism . in sec .",
    "[ sec 4 ] we discuss examples and applications to various @xmath0-states and the comparison to numerical calculation .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarise our principal results and future directions .",
    "quantum discord arises from the difference between two classically equivalent definitions for mutual information that are related through bayes theorem @xcite .",
    "firstly , the quantum mutual information , @xmath1 , is the total shared information between two quantum subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 being in a state @xmath4 , specifically @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the von neumman entropies @xcite of the reduced states @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the total state @xmath4 respectively .",
    "secondly , the quantum mutual information , @xmath11 , can be defined based on the quantum equivalence of bayes theorem .",
    "it represents the information gained about the subsystem @xmath3 after measuring the set @xmath12 on subsystem @xmath2 and it is given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the average conditional entropy of system @xmath3 , where @xmath15 is the probability to obtain the outcome @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the corresponding reduced density for subsystem @xmath3 .",
    "the minimization of conditional entropy is performed over all the possible positive operator valued measure ( p.o.v.m . )",
    "quantum discord is defined as the discrepancy between @xmath1 and @xmath11 , @xmath18 quantum discord can be understood as a measurement of the non - bayesianism of the state @xmath4 , or the amount of shared information that is not accessible by local measurements .",
    "it should be noticed that the information about @xmath3 given a measurement on @xmath2 is not necessary the same as the information of @xmath2 given a measurement on @xmath3 and therefore @xmath19 . the definition given in eq.([discorddefinition ] ) shows the challenge of calculating discord is to find the optimal measurement that minimizes the average conditional entropy @xmath20 .",
    "determining the optimal measurement is the focus of our discussion in the next section .",
    "let us consider two qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath0-state @xmath21 , which in the logic basis @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 has the following matrix representation @xmath26here the diagonal elements are complementary probabilities , @xmath27 , and the positivity of the density matrix requires @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we consider @xmath30 and @xmath31 real and positive numbers since their phases can be removed by local unitary operation @xcite and do not change the quantum correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for arbitrary two qubit states of rank 2 , the p.o.v.m that minimizes the conditional entropy is the projective von neumann measurement@xcite . for states of rank 3 and 4 f. galve",
    "@xcite showed that projective measurements are almost sufficient , except for states that appear with probability @xmath32 and in which case the deviations are on average of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "the projective measurement bases are characterized by the angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the bloch sphere , as follows @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "we consider measuring a with the above measurement bases , @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding outcome probabilities @xmath39 are @xmath40 and the average conditional entropy of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath41 , is written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 to simplify the analysis , we define following functions @xmath44 and constants @xmath45 it is worth noting that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 is symmetric with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider @xmath51 and @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the only @xmath35 dependence of @xmath48 is in the term @xmath53 of @xmath54 in eq.([b2 ] ) and @xmath48 becomes independent of @xmath35 when @xmath30 or @xmath31 is zero .",
    "we also note @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the expectation values of the @xmath31-component of the pauli vector , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the minimum of @xmath41 can be found by using the extreme value theorem @xcite .",
    "the critical points @xmath61 are determined by solving the first partial derivatives equations @xmath62 and @xmath63 and whether the critical point @xmath64 corresponds to a minimum is determined by the second partial derivatives test .",
    "i.e. the second partial derivatives and the hessian matrix determinant have to be simultaneously positive at @xmath64 @xmath65 otherwise the critical point * c * can correspond to a local maximum , a saddle point , or if hessian matrix determinant is zero , higher order test must be used to determine the nature of the critical point .",
    "+ we find the first partial derivatives of @xmath48 as @xmath66with @xmath67and    @xmath68    from these expressions we note several key features about the critical points :    * because @xmath69 , @xmath70 is always positive and the partial derivative of @xmath48 with regard to @xmath35 in eq.([cphi ] ) is zero only when @xmath71 is zero for any @xmath34 , i.e @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and when @xmath74 for any @xmath35 .",
    "we note that if @xmath34 is zero then the minimization does not depend on @xmath35 . at these @xmath75",
    "the second derivative @xmath76 becomes @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "+ since for any @xmath34 the second derivative @xmath76 is always negative when @xmath81 the minimization problem becomes one variable minimization problem where @xmath72 . as @xmath82 becomes a one variable function is not necessary consider the hessian determinant it is sufficient study the behavour of @xmath83 . * the derivative eq.([ctheta ] ) is zero at either @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",

    ", the optimization problem reduces to studying the second derivative of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath34 evaluated at the critical angles @xmath86 , @xmath73 , and @xmath88 .",
