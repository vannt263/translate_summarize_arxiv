    "a chain of arguments using thermodynamics , classical general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spaces shows that the black hole has an associated entropy proportional to the horizon area .",
    "this is arguably one of the most important clues to the understanding of the role of gravity at the quantum level .",
    "however , these calculations give no precise identification of the degrees of freedom responsible for the entropy , nor an explanation of its relation with area .",
    "there are several approaches in this regard , involving either specific models of quantum gravity or effective ideas @xcite .    a very appealing candidate in this last sense is given by the entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "on the black hole spacetime we can write the hilbert space of a quantum field as a tensor product of two hilbert spaces , which correspond to the asymptotic data at infinity and at the horizon respectively .",
    "the quantum state relevant for asymptotic observers is obtained by tracing the complete quantum state density matrix @xmath0 over the invisible degrees of freedom on the horizon . but @xmath1 contains correlations between the field modes inside and outside the black hole , or , in other words , it is entangled with respect to the above tensor product .",
    "thus , the partial trace leads to a mixed density matrix with non zero entropy .    for large black holes",
    "the near horizon geometry is approximately flat .",
    "this suggests that the relevant entropy should also occur in flat space @xcite . to mimic the black hole in minkowski space take a spatial hyperplane and a subset @xmath2 on it",
    "this divides the space in two , the interior and exterior regions with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the trace of the vacuum state over the interior ( or exterior ) degrees of freedom is a mixed density matrix .",
    "its entropy , being a function of the subset @xmath2 , was called geometric entropy @xcite .",
    "this new flat space quantity , suggested by black hole physics , is interesting in its own right , and provides a simpler context to contrast ideas .",
    "several authors have done explicit calculations of the geometric entropy in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the methods ranged from numerical work @xcite , to analytical calculations based on the replica trick , the heat kernel , and conformal symmetry in two dimensional spacetime @xcite . in all cases , the reassuring result is an entropy proportional to the area .",
    "however , most of the work has focused on free fields and a very restricted class of subsets .",
    "the application of the analytical methods was constrained to the infinite half space since they use in an essential way the fact that density matrix corresponding to the rindler wedge is a thermal one @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods encounter practical problems for non spherical subsets ( see however the recent work on annular and flower - like geometries @xcite ) .",
    "also , the physical principles behind the proportionality between area and entropy remain obscure beyond the explicit calculations , that involve dealing with non renormalizable divergences .    in this work",
    "we show that for a wide class of subsets the area law for the geometric entropy follows from very general and model independent ideas based on quantum mechanics and relativity .    we assume , as it has been done explicitly or implicitly in all the previous work on the subject , that it is possible to divide a cauchy surface into pieces and trace the vacuum state over the degrees of freedom in one of them to obtain a density matrix .",
    "this is the single basic condition allowing to define a geometric entropy .",
    "however , this is a delicate point , related to the divergences appearing in the qft calculations .",
    "we will only say a bit more about it in section iii .",
    "the causal evolution is unitary .",
    "accordingly , the geometric entropy corresponding to two space - like subsets coincide if they give place to the same causal domain of dependence , or , what is the same , they can be extended to a global cauchy surface by union with the same space - like subset .",
    "we also make use of the poincare symmetry of the vacuum state .",
    "it is essential to the arguments below the mathematical fact that the quantum mechanical entropy is positive and strongly subadditive .",
    "the strong subadditive property was introduced in @xcite , in the context of the investigations around an old problem in statistical mechanics , namely , the proof of the existence of the mean entropy ( the limit of entropy over volume for large sets ) . here",
    "we apply these ideas to the relativistic situation .",
    "note that for a general quantum statistical mechanical system the entropy in a given volume has to be defined in the same way as the geometric entropy is defined above , that is , by tracing over degrees of freedom in the appropriate domain . in this sense ,",
    "the geometric entropy is just the name for the more familiar concept of the entropy contained in a volume in the special case where the state is the relativistic vacuum .    the cited investigations on the euclidean symmetric situation where mainly focused on the extensive properties of the entropy on large domains .",
    "here the mean entropy is zero .",
    "basically , this is so because we can construct cauchy surfaces with arbitrarily small volume by approaching the null surfaces , and use the boost symmetries and the subadittive property to put an upper bound to the entropy which grows like the area .",
    "moreover , the strong subadditivity allows to completely determine the functional form of the geometric entropy .",
    "curiously , a very relevant piece of the information it provides , that gives the clue to show that the geometric entropy is not only bounded by the area but linearly growing with it , shows up already when combined only with translation invariance .",
    "however , the crucial limit for the geometric entropy is not the one of infinite volume but that of the very flat type of sets .    summarizing , we show that the combination of strong subadditivity , poincare symmetry and causality constrains the geometric entropy to be proportional to the bounding area , plus a constant term .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review some properties of the quantum entropy . in section iii we state the problem of the geometric entropy in euclidean and relativistic spaces . in section",
    "iv we review some work on the entropy for euclidean symmetric states and develop some new results on this subject , related to the entropy of very flat sets .",
    "the main result of the paper is the theorem in section v which states that geometric entropy is proportional to the area .",
    "finally we present the conclusions and discuss some open perspectives .",
    "in this section we review some inequalities satisfied by the quantum entropy .",
    "the proofs of the statements , the original references and further details can be found in the reviews @xcite .    in quantum mechanics a physical state",
    "is described by a density matrix @xmath3 , which is a self - adjoint and positive operator with unit trace , @xmath4 , defined on a hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "the entropy @xmath6 is a function of the quantum state given by the expression @xmath7 the quantum entropy is always positive , @xmath8 , being zero if and only if the state is pure , that is , the density matrix is a one dimensional projector @xmath9 .",
    "the entropy can be infinite for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces , while on a space with finite dimension @xmath10 it is bounded above by @xmath11 .",
    "the function @xmath6 satisfies @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are any positive numbers such that @xmath15 .",
    "the second inequality means that the effect of mixing always increases the entropy .",
    "moreover , any state can be decomposed as a mixing of pure states .    in the following",
    "we will be mainly interested in the properties of the entropy related to spaces constructed out of the tensor product of two or more hilbert spaces .",
    "let the hilbert space @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the density matrix on @xmath18 . by tracing over @xmath19 we can form the density matrix @xmath20 on @xmath21 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath22 is defined similarly by tracing over @xmath23 .    for a pure density matrix @xmath3",
    "the following duality property for the entropy of the subsystems holds @xmath24 this follows from the fact that for @xmath9 we have the equality @xmath25 for any power @xmath26 , and consequently the non zero eigenvalues and their multiplicities coincide for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to give examples where @xmath3 is pure , so that @xmath29 , while @xmath22 is in a mixed state with @xmath30 . thus , the quantum entropy can not be generically increasing ( monotonicity ) with the size ( the number of degrees of freedom ) of the subsystem ( nor with the size of the subsystem that is traced over ) .",
    "this is somehow against the intuition coming from the extensive entropy of gases .",
    "a natural question is what type of density matrices @xmath22 can arise from tracing a pure density matrix @xmath3 over a subsystem .",
    "the answer is that any density matrix can be obtained in this way .",
    "a density matrix @xmath22 on a space @xmath5 can always be realized as the partial trace of a pure density matrix @xmath3 on @xmath31 .",
    "the entropy for a system composed by two independent subsystems is the sum of the subsystem entropies .",
    "this is at the physical basis of the explicit form of @xmath6 given by equation ( [ entro ] ) .",
    "the density matrix for the composed system is given by the tensor product @xmath32 in this case , and we have the equation @xmath33    in the general case where @xmath3 does not factorize and the subsystems can not be considered as statistically independent , this equation can be extended to an inequality expressing the subadditive property of the entropy @xmath34    in fact the entropy satisfies a stronger inequality . to introduce it , it is convenient to consider a more general case in which the hilbert space of the system is a tensor product of an arbitrary number of factors @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the set of indices labeling the different subsystem hilbert spaces @xmath37",
    ". let @xmath38 be any subset of the set of indices @xmath36 .",
    "define the corresponding reduced density matrix on @xmath39 , by tracing over all @xmath37 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 call @xmath42 the corresponding entropy .",
    "with this notation the subadditive property ( [ saa ] ) writes @xmath43 for any pair of subsets @xmath38 and @xmath44 of @xmath36 , while the duality relation for a pure total density matrix @xmath3 is simply @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the set complementary to @xmath38 in @xmath36 .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath36 can be artificially enlarged to a bigger set @xmath47 , and the total density matrix can be taken pure in the enlarged space , without modifying the value of @xmath48 for @xmath49 . in this case",
    "( [ menos ] ) holds in the bigger space @xmath47 .",
    "applying subadditivity to the complements @xmath46 and @xmath50 we have @xmath51 , since the complement operation interchanges union and intersection .",
    "thus , purifying the total density matrix the inequality ( [ saa ] ) implies a different relation , namely @xmath52 the strong subadditivity ( ssa ) generalizes the relations ( [ sub ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) in a form that is self - dual under taking complements in the pure case .",
    "it writes @xmath53    using the trick of working with an artificially purified density matrix the ssa applied to @xmath38 and @xmath50 leads to a different self - dual relation .",
    "this is @xmath54 where @xmath55 means @xmath56",
    ". the inequalities ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ultima ] ) are equivalent in the pure case but they are both valid in general . in lack of a better name , and since it is closely related to ssa , we often call ssb the inequality ( [ ultima ] ) .    finally , we also mention that for two non intersecting sets @xmath38 and @xmath44 the ssa and ssb relations lead to the following triangle inequalities for the entropies @xmath57 the second one is of course subadditivity .",
    "the inequalities ( [ tri ] ) are useful to prove some continuity properties of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , if the entropy of @xmath44 is very small one has that @xmath48 and @xmath58 are very near to each other .",
    "we mentioned that @xmath6 is not monotonic in general . by monotonicity here",
    "we mean the property @xmath59 for any @xmath60 .",
    "however , the inequality ( [ ultima ] ) , or the first one from ( [ tri ] ) , can be thought as partial compensations for the lack of monotonicity .",
    "inequalities provide less concrete information and are more difficult to handle than equations .",
    "this is perhaps the reason why the relations ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ultima ] ) are relatively poorly known and have found only few applications .",
    "however , in the presence of symmetries these can be very useful as will become apparent in the following .",
    "let us consider a continuous quantum system in @xmath61 described in terms of a fock space .",
    "the single particle states are given by elements of @xmath62 , the hilbert space of square integrable functions in @xmath61 , while the @xmath26 particle space is the product of @xmath26 copies of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where the tensor product is understood as symmetrized or antisymmetrized according to the particles being bosons or fermions .",
    "the fock space is then given by the direct sum @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we can define the single particle states in a given volume @xmath66 in @xmath61 as @xmath67 , and its corresponding fock space @xmath68 .",
    "if the intersection of two sets @xmath69 and @xmath70 has zero measure we have @xmath71 now , let the density matrix of the system be @xmath72 .",
    "we can define a density matrix @xmath73 for a volume @xmath66 by tracing @xmath72 over @xmath74 .",
    "its entropy is @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the density matrices corresponding to the subsets satisfy the compatibility condition @xmath76 where @xmath77 is any set that has measure zero intersection with @xmath66 .",
    "a continuous quantum system is defined here as a set of hilbert spaces and density matrices corresponding to subsets of @xmath78 satisfying the conditions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the strong subadditive inequalities then take a geometric form given by ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ultima ] ) , where now @xmath38 and @xmath44 represent subsets of @xmath78 @xcite .    the problem of building a continuous quantum system can be presented in a slightly different way where the complete system is constructed out of the finite volume subsystems .",
    "these may be defined for example by giving a hamiltonian and boundary conditions , and taking a finite volume density matrix @xmath79 .",
    "then , to glue all elements into a unique system we have to impose ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) on the local hilbert spaces and states .    when the total state @xmath3 is invariant under some transformation @xmath80 in @xmath78 the entropy @xmath81 is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "this symmetry combined with the properties of the entropy can strongly constrain the function @xmath6 .",
    "we say that a positive function @xmath6 on subsets of @xmath78 is an euclidean entropy function if it is invariant under rotations and translations , and satisfies ssa and ssb .",
    "in the relativistic case a pair of time - like related subsets contains degrees of freedom that are not mutually independent . a scheme as the previous one for an euclidean system , where ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) hold , must correspond to every cauchy surface in spacetime .",
    "all previous work on geometric entropy assumes that we can divide a cauchy surface for the spacetime into pieces and trace the total state over the degrees of freedom on one of them to obtain a density matrix .",
    "this assumption is also made here , since it is fundamental to the very definition of a geometric entropy .    however , this is at the root of the divergences encountered in quantum field theory calculations .",
    "the complete localization of states in a given region is forbidden by standard axioms in qft ( see @xcite for a clear discussion on this point ) .",
    "the covariant regularizations that deal with the infinites arising in perturbation theory can not in general avoid the divergence in the entropy , which shows up at the level of free fields .",
    "also , this is not softened by supersymmetry .",
    "thus , as these divergences suggest , there are two types of enigma related to the black hole entropy formula .",
    "the first is given by the proportionality between area and entropy , and the second one is that the entropy is surprisingly finite .",
    "here we do not deal with this last and probably deeper problem .",
    "it is possible that a finite entropy would require quantum gravity input ( see also a different idea in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the existence of a good covariant definition for a finite geometric entropy in the context of qft can not be discarded .",
    "but , in that case , the role of the set boundaries can not be taken as purely passive .",
    "in other words , to define a bounded system hilbert space , boundary conditions are needed .",
    "the precise compatibility conditions that these bounded systems should have in order to be used for computing a geometric entropy are given by ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "this will be enough characterization for our purposes . any non ambiguous definition for a localized entropy beyond the classical limit should suffer from the same problem .",
    "in particular , this is the case for the various entropy bounds present in the literature , which are suggested by ideas related to the physics of black holes @xcite . in the semiclassical level they should take into account the geometric entropy of quantum origin , what can make them much more constraining and interesting @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we assign a density matrix and an entropy to any subset @xmath38 of a cauchy surface @xmath82 . in the following",
    "we restrict the analysis to the @xmath38 with compact closure .",
    "the conditions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are assumed to hold among the subsets of any such surface @xmath82 .",
    "the causal development @xmath83 of @xmath38 is the set where the solution of a wave like equation is uniquely determined by the initial data on @xmath38 .",
    "more generally , for any set @xmath84 not necessarily space - like , the causal development is the set of points @xmath85 such that every inextensible time - like curve through @xmath85 cuts @xmath84 .",
    "we often say , abusing of the terminology , that a space - like set @xmath38 is a cauchy surface for @xmath83 .",
    "consider two subsets @xmath38 and @xmath86 of different cauchy surfaces @xmath82 and @xmath87 , but having the same causal development @xmath88 ( see fig.([rela1])a ) .",
    "we can extend @xmath38 and @xmath86 with the same set to form a global cauchy surface , that is , we can choose @xmath89 .",
    "the unitarity of the causal evolution implies that we have @xmath90 this means that there is no loss nor gain of information in passing from @xmath38 to @xmath86 . in the heisenberg picture",
    "both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are obtained by tracing the total state over the same degrees of freedom in @xmath89 .",
    "then , @xmath83 can be seen as an equivalence class of pieces of cauchy surfaces with the same causal development , density matrix and entropy .",
    "note that all cauchy surfaces for @xmath83 share the same boundary , the spatial corner of @xmath83 ( the subset of the closure of @xmath83 that is not time - like related to any point in @xmath38 , see the figure ( [ rela1 ] ) ) .",
    "the sets of the type @xmath83 are called here causally closed , and they constitute the natural domain of @xmath6 in the relativistic case .",
    "we often make no distinction between the set @xmath83 and an element @xmath38 on the equivalence class it represents , and denote them with the same capital letter .",
    "now we identify the conditions allowing to apply the strong subadditive property for any two given causally closed sets @xmath83 and @xmath93 . as a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) the ssa and ssb inequalities in the form ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ultima ] ) take place for the entropies of two subsets @xmath38 and @xmath44 of the same global cauchy surface @xmath82 . in that case",
    "the sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 appearing in the smaller side of the strong subadditive relation are cauchy surfaces for @xmath96 and the the causal development of @xmath97 respectively .",
    "however , it is possible to apply ssa and ssb even in some cases where @xmath38 and @xmath44 do not belong to the same @xmath82 . as the entropies really depend on the equivalence classes @xmath83 and @xmath93 , this happens if there are different cauchy surfaces @xmath86 and @xmath98 for @xmath83 and @xmath93 that belong to the same global cauchy surface @xmath99 .",
    "we say that two causally closed sets @xmath83 and @xmath93 ( or any pair of cauchy surfaces for them ) commute if there is at least a pair of the respective cauchy surface representatives that belong to the same global cauchy surface ( see fig.([rela1])b ) .",
    "it can be seen that an equivalent condition for the commutativity of @xmath83 and @xmath93 is that their spatial corners are spatial to each other . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath83 includes @xmath93 or they are spatially separated , they commute .",
    "the inequalities ssa or ssb can be applied only for the entropies of commuting elements .",
    "for these , the right hand side of ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ultima ] ) has to be calculated with any pair of cauchy surface representatives belonging to the same global cauchy surface .",
    "there is a more elegant way to define the concept of causally closed sets and commutativity that has interesting connections with quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "write @xmath100 for two points that are time - like related .",
    "given any subset @xmath84 of the spacetime define its causal opposite @xmath101 as the subset of points which are spatial to @xmath84 , @xmath102 .",
    "the causally closed sets are just the subsets @xmath84 which coincide with their double opposite , @xmath103   are exactly the domain of dependence of achronal sets bounded in time @xcite . ]",
    ". curiously , this sets form an orthomodular lattice ( also called quantum logic ) .",
    "this structure is also shared by the physical propositions in quantum mechanics , or equivalently , the orthogonal projectors on the hilbert space . in any orthomodular lattice",
    "there are three operations , the opposite , the meet @xmath104 and the join @xmath105 of two elements , and an order relation @xmath106 . in the present context",
    "they are given respectively by the above opposite , the intersection @xmath107 , the double opposite of the union @xmath108 , and the set inclusion relation @xmath106 .",
    "there is a definition of commutativity of two elements for any orthomodular lattice that coincides with the usual commutativity of operators when applied to projectors in the hilbert space .",
    "two elements @xmath38 and @xmath44 commute when @xmath109 this definition coincides with the one given above for the commutativity of causally closed sets .",
    "thus , the compatibility requirement that two causally closed sets have cauchy surfaces which can be extended to a common global one can be put in the same mathematical terms as the compatibility condition for two projection operators to be simultaneously measurable . with this notation , the ssa and ssb relations for two commuting sets @xmath38 and @xmath44 are @xmath110 respectively .",
    "a relativistic entropy function is defined as a positive function on the causally closed sets in minkowski space , symmetric under poincare transformations , and satisfying ssa and ssb for commuting pairs of subsets",
    ". the use of the relation ssb in the proofs below may be avoided , but it considerably simplify the demonstrations .    thus , the problem of finding the functional dependence of the geometric entropy takes a precise mathematical form , being equivalent to find the most general relativistic entropy function .",
    "we note that a linear combination of solutions with positive coefficients is also a solution .",
    "a similar problem can be stated in any space - time , but in absence of the poincare symmetry the number of solutions can be very big .",
    "for example , the flux of any future directed conserved current through a cauchy surface for a causally closed set @xmath38 is always a solution of ssa and ssb since it satisfies the strong subadditive equation ( rather than inequality ) .",
    "of course this solution is not poincare invariant in minkowski space .",
    "symmetries with orbits that are exclusively time - like ( or space - like ) do not impede this type of extensive solutions .    in this paper we are only using causally closed sets with compact closure , and , as in the euclidean case ,",
    "make no distinction between sets differing by zero measure subsets .",
    "the game to compare the entropies on different sets using strong subadditivity is more subtle than in an ordinary additive measure theory . because of",
    "that we further restrict the class of subsets . to see what are the difficulties about ,",
    "consider first the polyhedra on the euclidean space @xmath78 .",
    "the intersections and unions of polyhedra are again polyhedra .",
    "thus , the relations ssa and ssb can not be used to obtain information for the entropy of sets with curved borders from the entropy on polyhedra . in order to focus on the most restrictive relations coming from the entropy properties and the symmetries , in the following we consider the domain of the euclidean entropy functions to be the class of all polyhedra .",
    "note , however , that these can have an arbitrarily large number of faces as small as we want , and , in this sense , we can approach any set by polyhedra . to connect the results about polyhedra with other kind of sets",
    "some continuity condition is needed , and we do not deal with this problem here . in the relativistic @xmath111 dimensional case",
    "we consider the class of relativistic polyhedra , that is , spatial @xmath10 dimensional sets ( or their corresponding @xmath111 dimensional causally closed sets ) formed by union of a finite number of polyhedra on spatial hyperplanes .",
    "these also form a closed class under union and intersection when taken between commuting sets .    a note on the terminology .",
    "we call @xmath112 the volume of a @xmath10 dimensional euclidean polyhedron @xmath2 , and @xmath113 to the area of the @xmath114 dimensional boundary of @xmath2 . for a relativistic @xmath111 dimensional polyhedron @xmath2",
    "we call @xmath113 the area of its spatial corner , which is the boundary of any cauchy surface for @xmath2",
    ". a relativistic entropy function @xmath6 on @xmath111 dimensions when restricted to polyhedra on a unique hyperplane gives place to an euclidean entropy function on @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "this latter is independent of the chosen hyperplane . when it is possible , we identify these functions , and call them with the same letter .",
    "consider a system on the real line and a translational invariant density matrix @xmath72 .",
    "the connected compact sets on @xmath115 are intervals , determined up to a translation by their length @xmath85 . on these intervals",
    "the entropy can be written as a function on a real variable @xmath116 .",
    "the results we obtain here about @xmath116 can be found for example in the ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "take two intervals of length @xmath117 , with @xmath85 and @xmath118 positive and @xmath119 , and arrange them so that their intersection has length @xmath85 and consequently their union has length @xmath118 . applying strong subadditivity we have @xmath120 suppose now that @xmath116 is infinite .",
    "then it follows from ( [ weak ] ) that @xmath121 must be infinite for @xmath122 . repeatedly using this argument we have that the function @xmath116 is either finite for all @xmath85 or always infinite .",
    "similar arguments can be used to show that all the entropy functions considered in the paper are either infinite or always finite .",
    "we are not coming back to this point and assume a finite @xmath6 in the following .",
    "the relation ( [ weak ] ) for the function @xmath116 is called weak concavity , while the concavity is the property @xmath123 for any @xmath124 .",
    "a function is concave when the segment joining any two points in its graph lies below the function curve ( see the fig.([conca ] ) ) .",
    "weak concavity is in fact very near concavity , since applying ( [ weak ] ) repeatedly it is easy to obtain eq.([concave ] ) for any rational @xmath125 with a power of @xmath126 as a denominator .",
    "for example , we have @xmath127 . to show",
    "that @xmath128 is actually concave suppose that @xmath129 and , violating concavity , @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath132 with @xmath133 $ ] a rational with a power of @xmath126 as a denominator .",
    "we can take @xmath134 with @xmath135 a positive number as small as we want .",
    "positioning two intervals of length @xmath136 such that their union has length @xmath137 , and their intersection has length @xmath138 , we have from ssa and ( [ paro ] ) @xmath139 thus , as near to @xmath136 as we want there are points in which , let say , @xmath140 . by repeating this argument for a sufficient number of times we could arrive at the result that there would be points as near to @xmath136 as we want that have negative @xmath6 . as the entropy is positive , equation ( [ paro ] ) must be wrong , and the function @xmath6 is concave , equation ( [ concave ] ) holds for any @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "the converse is also true , concavity implies strong subadditivity for intervals .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath141 it is @xmath142 .",
    "then the function @xmath143 is decreasing for any @xmath144 , because a consequence of concavity is that the slope of the function @xmath6 always decreases .",
    "this would lead to @xmath145 for high enough @xmath136 . to avoid it the function @xmath6",
    "must be non decreasing everywhere .",
    "the monotonicity of the entropy appears here as a consequence of translation symmetry .",

    "there is a non constant solution , the one proportional to @xmath195 , that is constant over the one component sets and adds to @xmath146 .",
    "however , as it will be clear from what follows , in more dimensions there is no such solution . in particular , there are no positive topological solutions to the strong subadditive inequalities .",
    "curiously , the euler number @xmath395 , which is the second solution appearing in the two dimensional formula ( [ euler ] ) , satisfies the strong additive equality , @xmath396 in any dimension .",
    "however , for @xmath331 it attains negative values .",
    "now consider any relativistic polyhedron @xmath2 .",
    "it contains a sufficiently small rectangular polyhedron @xmath373 lying in a spatial hyperplane @xmath397 .",
    "we can generate a copy @xmath201 of @xmath373 by translating @xmath373 on @xmath397 in a direction perpendicular to a phase @xmath398 of @xmath373 , and such that @xmath399 .",
    "for @xmath201 sufficiently far from @xmath2 there is a time - like hyperplane parallel to @xmath398 in between @xmath2 and @xmath201 that divides the minkowski space in two parts , one of which contains @xmath2 and the other @xmath201 .",
    "let us call @xmath400 ( see fig.([sus])a ) .",
    "now , from lemma 2 we have that for small enough @xmath201 @xmath401 then , by means of a @xmath402 angle rotation and a small translation on @xmath397 we can make a copy of @xmath403 whose intersection with @xmath403 is a small rectangular polyhedron inside @xmath201 .",
    "it follows from strong subadditivity that @xmath404 .",
    "then taking the limit of small @xmath201 we have @xmath405 for any @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we can safely subtract @xmath406 from the entropy without violating positivity .",
    "strong subadditivity for the subtracted function will be automatic for the case where the two commuting sets @xmath2 and @xmath236 have non empty intersection . when the intersection @xmath407 we have to prove @xmath408 to show that the subtracted function is still subadditive . to see this , consider a set @xmath400 as above , but now we choose @xmath201 included in @xmath236 ( see fig([sus])a ) .",
    "then @xmath409 from ( [ dosde ] ) and taking limits the relation ( [ eee ] ) follows .",
    "this shows that subtracting the constant solution @xmath410 leads to a positive strongly subadditive solution .",
    "it also satisfies ssb as follows from similar arguments based on the construction of fig([sus])b for the case in which the inequality is applied to the sets @xmath2 and @xmath236 with @xmath237 ( otherwise there are two non empty sets on each side of the ssb inequality , which holds trivially for the subtracted function ) .",
    "once we have subtracted @xmath410 we can repeat the procedure with the subtracted function @xmath411 to subtract @xmath412 , and then @xmath413 , etc .. it follows that we can subtract a constant solution @xmath414 for any @xmath415 and still get a solution .",
    "thus @xmath416 is also positive and satisfies ssa and ssb .",
    "taking into account the proposition 1 we work with the subtracted function and assume @xmath418 .",
    "we show that @xmath419 , or , what is the same , @xmath420 .",
    "to do so we need to make some geometrical constructions and use that the entropy for sets that are flat in more than one perpendicular direction can be safely neglected . in the notation of section iii",
    "this writes @xmath421 for @xmath422 .",
    "it is possible to write this last equation and the result we are looking for , @xmath423 in a compact manner , that is , @xmath424 , for @xmath425 .",
    "here we used that @xmath426 for @xmath427 . recall that @xmath305 .",
    "each @xmath428 is a function on the polyhedra on @xmath429 , with @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "then , we show by induction that all the functions @xmath428 for @xmath425 are zero in the relativistic case when @xmath418 . for @xmath432",
    "this is true .",
    "we show that if @xmath433 then @xmath434 .",
    "consider first a polyhedra @xmath435 in @xmath436 with a wedge - like form , @xmath437 .",
    "call @xmath201 the @xmath438 dimensional rectangular polyhedron with sides @xmath439 .",
    "we are interested in the limit of @xmath440 as @xmath441 and @xmath442 go to zero . apply ssa and ssb to the constructions of fig([tria])a and fig([tria])b respectively , and using the induction hypothesis neglect sets that are small in more than one direction .",
    "we obtain two inequalities that are opposite in the limit of zero @xmath441 , @xmath442 .",
    "they lead to the equation @xmath443 thus this limit is the same as the one for flat rectangular polyhedra . in particular",
    "this holds for the function @xmath6 of flat wedge sets , what corresponds to @xmath444 in the last equation .",
    "now consider the construction of fig.([multic ] ) involving @xmath445 dimensional polyhedra .",
    "the set @xmath370 is formed by the union of two copies of a flat rectangular polyhedron @xmath446 $ ] having principal planes that form a small angle @xmath447 . using the lemma 2 we have that @xmath448 in the limit of small @xmath239 ( see fig .",
    "( [ multic])b ) . by the same reason @xmath449 in that limit ( see fig.([multic])c ) .",
    "then it follows that @xmath450 .",
    "this means that we can move each of the components that are copies of @xmath277 in @xmath370 a direction perpendicular to their principal plane without changing the limit of the entropy for @xmath253 .",
    "thus , it also follows that @xmath451 .",
    "now we show that these two last limits have different expressions in terms of the function @xmath428 when @xmath452 . with the help of the auxiliary sets drawn with dashed and dotted lines in the fig([multic])c and ( [ multic])d , and applying to these constructions ssb and ssa respectively we obtain @xmath453 where we have written explicitly the side lengths of the rectangular polyhedron that enter in the arguments of @xmath428 and @xmath454 are the side lengths of @xmath201 .",
    "therefore @xmath455 , and from here @xmath456 for any integer @xmath457 . in the limit of large @xmath457 the right hand side of ( [ leftha ] ) is just @xmath458 , which is zero by the induction hypothesis .",
    "as the strongly subadditive an positive function @xmath428 is zero for all rectangular polyhedra it must be zero for all polyhedra , since they can be written as union of simplexes , which in turn can be written as intersections of rectangular polyhedra .",
    "this completes the proof of the    let @xmath6 be a @xmath10 dimensional relativistic entropy function and @xmath459 the @xmath114 dimensional euclidean function defined in section iv . if @xmath418 then @xmath460 .      finally , we prove the theorem 3 .",
    "we take @xmath6 with @xmath418 and prove @xmath461 is proportional to the spatial border area of @xmath2 . from proposition 2",
    "it follows for the flat polyhedra that @xmath462)\\rightarrow 2s\\ , \\text{vol}(x)$ ] for any @xmath114 dimensional @xmath2 in the limit @xmath253 .",
    "thus , in this case the theorem 3 holds , since the boundary area of @xmath463 $ ] is @xmath464 .    a @xmath10 dimensional simplex w can be written as @xmath465 , where @xmath466 are the vectors pointing to the simplex vertices .",
    "we are interested in a simplex in which @xmath467 , where the vector @xmath468 lies inside the simplex phase @xmath398 with vertices @xmath469 and @xmath470 is a vector perpendicular to this phase .",
    "we are going to find an upper bound for the entropy @xmath471 in the limit of small @xmath472 .",
    "first decompose @xmath473 as union of the @xmath10 simplexes formed with vertices @xmath468 and @xmath474 , plus any subset of @xmath114 vectors among the vectors @xmath469 .",
    "we decompose each of these simplexes as union of wedge sets with small width @xmath239 , plus a number of small sets , as shown in the fig.([sim1 ] ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath475 the previous results show that the entropy of the wedge sets is proportional to the @xmath114 dimensional volume of their big phase .",
    "the entropy of the smaller sets is bounded by some constant times the @xmath114 volume of their projection on the plane of the simplex @xmath398 , since these sets can be formed by intersections of flat wedge and flat rectangular polyhedra .",
    "taking the limit of small @xmath472 and @xmath239 we then have @xmath476    consider now any simplex @xmath277 with vertices @xmath477 on the hyperplane of time @xmath478 , and let @xmath479 be their faces .",
    "call @xmath480 the centre of the inscribed sphere , the unique sphere that is tangent to all the faces of @xmath277 , and let @xmath457 be its radius .",
    "the point @xmath85 with spatial component @xmath480 at time @xmath481 is at null distance to all @xmath479 .",
    "call @xmath482 , with @xmath483 the null simplex determined by the phase @xmath484 and @xmath85 , and @xmath485 , with @xmath486 , to the @xmath114 dimensional simplex that is the common phase of @xmath482 and @xmath487 ( see fig.([sim2])a ) .",
    "a point @xmath118 with spatial component @xmath480 at time @xmath488 would be at small distance from the faces of @xmath277 for @xmath158 small .",
    "the point @xmath118 and a phase @xmath484 of @xmath277 determine a flat simplex @xmath489 in the above sense , which converge to @xmath482 in the limit @xmath490 .",
    "the union of the simplexes @xmath489 for @xmath483 form a cauchy surface for @xmath277 . we can slightly contract each of the simplexes @xmath489 in their own hyperplanes to form the simplexes @xmath491 , which are are at positive distance @xmath239 from each other ( see fig.([sim2])b ) .",
    "we can further impose to the faces of @xmath491 and @xmath492 that are adjacent to each other to be parallel .",
    "then , we add flat elements @xmath493 formed by the cartesian product of simplexes @xmath494 , slightly smaller than the @xmath485 , and a small interval @xmath495 , in such a way to fill in the gaps between the different @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",
    "we can take all the @xmath493 and the @xmath491 to be commuting and the intersections of the @xmath493 with @xmath491 and @xmath492 to be non empty sets of the form @xmath494 times small intervals .",
    "the union of all the @xmath491 , the @xmath493 , and a number of sets that are small in more than one perpendicular direction simultaneously and have vanishing small entropy when taking limits , form a cauchy surface for @xmath277 .",
    "in the limits @xmath496 and @xmath253 the entropy for the flat simplexes @xmath491 becomes @xmath280 times their big phase volume , which coincides with @xmath497 .",
    "the entropy for @xmath493 as well as the one for its intersection with @xmath491 or @xmath492 converges to @xmath498 in this limit ( taking also @xmath499 and @xmath500 ) .",
    "thus , the application of ssa to this geometrical construction leads to the inequality @xmath501 now , as the hypersurfaces @xmath482 are null and have zero expansion , we have that the volume of @xmath484 is equal to the sum of the volumes of the @xmath485 for all @xmath502 different from @xmath503 .",
    "thus , @xmath504 from here and the fact that @xmath505 by definition , we have @xmath506    the formula ( [ quipus ] ) allows us to obtain the corresponding inequality for any relativistic polyhedron @xmath2 .",
    "this can be decomposed into simplexes @xmath507 having empty intersection or intersecting in adjacent faces @xmath485 .",
    "we use the same procedure as above . slightly contract the simplexes @xmath507 and fill the gaps in the cauchy surface for @xmath2 with sets @xmath493 formed by product of simplexes @xmath494 ( converging to @xmath485 when taking the limit ) and small intervals . the @xmath493",
    "are taken to intersect with the @xmath507 and @xmath508 in sets that are the product of @xmath494 and small intervals .",
    "then , in the application of ssa to the construction , all the internal faces determined by adjacent simplexes @xmath507 and @xmath508 do not contribute .",
    "this is because , according to ( [ quipus ] ) , the contributions from the entropies of @xmath507 and @xmath508 to the term corresponding to the phase @xmath485 add to @xmath498 , the contribution of @xmath493 converges to @xmath509 , while on the other side of the inequality , the intersection of @xmath493 with @xmath507 and @xmath508 gives @xmath510 .",
    "therefore , only the external faces of the @xmath507 ( those that are also faces of @xmath2 ) contribute to the inequality , and we have @xmath511 for all @xmath2 .",
    "now take a rectangular polyhedron @xmath201 of sides @xmath512 , and call its faces @xmath513 with @xmath514 ( @xmath201 has two faces equal to each @xmath513 ) . consider also the sets @xmath515 $ ] and @xmath516 $ ] , where @xmath517 $ ] is a one dimensional set of two components of size @xmath239 separated by a distance @xmath239 .",
    "we have @xmath518 and @xmath519 .",
    "we can form a big rectangular polyhedron @xmath277 by union of translated and non intersecting copies of @xmath201 , the adjacent ones separated by a distance @xmath239 , and filling the gaps by copies of the @xmath520 that intersect with the copies of @xmath201 in sets that are translated copies of @xmath521 . to complete @xmath277",
    "we have to add sets that are small in more than one direction .",
    "taking into account ( [ aaa ] ) the limit of @xmath522 for @xmath277 going to infinity is zero .",
    "thus , the application of ssa to the construction leads in the limit of small @xmath239 and infinite @xmath277 to @xmath523 thus , the equality @xmath524 holds for any rectangular polyhedron .",
    "any relativistic polyhedron @xmath2 is included into some rectangular polyhedron @xmath201 .",
    "complete a cauchy surface for @xmath2 with simplexes to form a cauchy surface for @xmath201 .",
    "then , repeating the above procedure for dealing with the internal adjacent boundaries we obtain from ssa @xmath525 this finishes the proof of theorem 3 .",
    "the properties of the quantum entropy make possible to deal with the geometric entropy in a geometrical way .",
    "however , even if it is believed that this quantity has a deep physical significance , it remains an abstract concept , wanting for a solid mathematical basis to compute it . in this sense , the principles employed in the paper to obtain the area law are very basic and general , and one can expect them to be still available once a finite geometric entropy is defined .",
    "a more immediate meaning can also be given to our results .",
    "they indicate that the entropy must be proportional to the area in the limit of infinite cutoff for any regularization scheme in qft where covariant results are obtained asymptotically . in other words ,",
    "the leading divergence in the entropy must be proportional to the area for any set .",
    "we remark that the theorem shown in this paper tells that no subleading term exists in the continuum , excepting the constant .",
    "this is indeed what all previous qft calculations have shown for particular cases . besides",
    ", we have also checked the area law for an spherical corona using the numerical method of ref .",
    "this case has also been studied in @xcite in a related context .",
    "this is a very interesting example since it allows to test a very important and counterintuitive characteristic of the area solution , namely , that it is not ordered by inclusion outside the class of convex sets .",
    "as expected , the leading term in the entropy grows with the sum ( with equal coefficients ) of the areas of the internal and external surfaces of the corona .",
    "there is a curiosity about the euclidean solutions which could be related both with the uniqueness of the relativistic entropy function and to the divergences . in the euclidean case it is possible to construct many entropy functions averaging over translations and rotations positive and strongly subadditive functions which are not euclidean symmetric . among all these",
    ", we can find in particular some very interesting monotonic solutions that are exactly proportional to the area for the convex sets and less than the area for the non convex ones , and where the entropy of two distant objects interact by their mutual shadow .",
    "we suspect that a classification of euclidean solutions could be possible using this averaging method .",
    "coming back to the relativistic case we see that a similar construction does not work since the lorentz group is non compact , leading to divergent integrals .",
    "this is so even taking compact sets to make finite the integration over translations .",
    "an interesting question related to the qft calculations is the physical meaning of the coefficient relating area and entropy and the constant term .",
    "the coefficient of the area term was related to the newton constant in @xcite ( see however @xcite ) , making contact with the black hole entropy . for @xmath306",
    "dimensional conformal field theories it was shown in @xcite that the most divergent term for the single interval entropy is a constant ( independent of size ) proportional to the central charge .",
    "this coefficient corresponds to the combination @xmath526 according to ( [ euler ] ) .",
    "a natural question here is if a new parameter shows up in the expression for the multicomponent set entropy @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the entropy can be simply proportional to the number of components ( @xmath527 ) , or it can contain an additional constant term @xmath194 , with the same degree of divergence as @xmath195 .",
    "it is possible that this last term is always subleading and negligible in the continuum .",
    "this is specially expected in more dimensions since the constant term requires a dimensionless parameter , while the dimensionfull one in front of the area term diverges with the cutoff .",
    "thus , the constant may represent a spurious solution for @xmath331 .",
    "the entropy per unit area @xmath207 is a function @xmath528 of the poincare symmetric state @xmath3 .",
    "the combination of the inequalities ( [ sll ] ) and theorem 3 imply that given any two such states we have @xmath529 for positive @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath530 .",
    "thus the entropy per unit area is afin under mixing of states , a property known for the mean entropy per unit volume of traslational invariant states .",
    "the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ fg ] ) is however unclear to the author .    in a series of recent papers",
    "a very interesting phenomena has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "the authors discovered that the entropy in a volume is not the only quantity that scales with the area of the given region but the same behavior is expected for a whole class of operators averaged using the local density matrices .",
    "in particular they showed the area law for the energy fluctuations .",
    "the results of this paper rely heavily on the use of the strong subadditive property of the entropy , and thus they can not be extended directly to operator correlations . however , it is possible that the method here could be generalized by introducing chemical potentials for suitable operators attached to the local regions .",
    "the proof in this paper uses explicitly arbitrarily small and large distances .",
    "the infiniteness of the space is specially relevant in the argument around the constructions of fig.([multic ] ) , which involve large translations , and lead to the equation @xmath531 .",
    "this is what excludes the possibility of finding a solution ordered by inclusion .",
    "however , it is not excluded that different type of solutions exist in de sitter space .",
    "this has compact cauchy surfaces , and it is also maximally symmetric , what most probably can allow us to make a complete classification of solutions as the one given here for the minkowski space @xcite .",
    "the entropy of the black hole and the geometric entropy are empty space quantities .",
    "there are a number of proposals for general bounds to the entropy of bounded systems which are suggested by the physics of black holes .",
    "they have been successfully checked mainly in the classical regime .",
    "the definition of a bounded system requires a partition of the hilbert space into a tensor product , and it is necessary to add boundary conditions .",
    "thus , at the semiclassical level , the entropy bounds should include a term coming from the vacuum correlations , even in empty space ( see similar ideas in @xcite ) . in principle , this could greatly tighten the inequalities .",
    "how do these bounds compare with our result in flat space ? .",
    "consider the covariant bound proposed in @xcite , which is related both with the bekenstein bound @xcite and the generalized second law .",
    "take a @xmath114 dimensional spatial surface @xmath532 and a null congruence @xmath533 orthogonal to it , having non positive expansion , and ending in another @xmath114 dimensional spatial surface @xmath534 .",
    "the bound states that the entropy crossing @xmath533 is bounded above by a constant times @xmath535 .",
    "thus , this gives zero entropy for our polyhedra , since they have cauchy surfaces formed by union of null flat surfaces having zero expansion .",
    "this touches upon the question of the geometric entropy for a more general type of subsets than the one considered here .",
    "the area and the constant term are not the most general solutions of the ssa inequalities for larger classes of subsets than the polyhedra .",
    "take for example the class of subsets with piecewise differentiable spatial corner .",
    "it is also a closed class under intersection and union of commuting sets .",
    "as can be easily seen from fig([rela1])b , the integral over the spatial corner of any geometrical quantity that is positive and local gives place to a relativistic entropy function .",
    "of course , the theorem 3 implies that these solutions are proportional to the area on the polyhedra . as an example of such a local quantity we can take the square of the expansion of the future null boundary of the given causally closed set . in this case",
    "the entropy is non zero for the sphere and zero for every polyhedron approaching it .",
    "this shows that this type of solutions has a very pathological discontinuous behavior .",
    "excluding these solutions , probably unphysical , it seems we are left with two possibilities , either the covariant bound is wrong outside the classical domain , or the assumptions of this paper fail somewhere",
    ". however , it is also possible and likely that the covariant bound has to be applied to a regularized notion of entropy which is zero on minkowski space .",
    "this is appealing , since the calculation of the black hole entropy using the euclidean path integral requires the subtraction of the corresponding flat space quantity @xcite .",
