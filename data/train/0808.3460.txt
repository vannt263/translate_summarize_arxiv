    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in iron - pnictide materials@xcite has attracted widespread interest in elucidating the superconductivity mechanism and searching for new high - t@xmath3 materials@xcite .",

    "recently , superconductivity was discovered in the afe@xmath0as@xmath0 materials ( a = ca , ba , sr ) which have similar feas layers .",
    "it has been reported that the transition temperature can be as high as 38 k for ( k , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and ( k , sr)fe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "all of these compounds show an antiferromagnetic order and a structural transition with similar ordering temperatures@xcite .",
    "although the superconductivity mechanism is not yet known up to now , the phonon mediated pairing seems to be ruled out@xcite .",
    "the fact that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations coexist with superconductivity indicates that the nature of superconductivity should be complex and unconventional in the feas - based compounds@xcite , like that of the cuprate high - t@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "stoichiometric bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is not superconductor but an antiferromagnet@xcite .",

    "the reason we concentrate on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 to investigate the pressure effect is that its superconductivity , in a wide pressure range ( between 2 - 6 gpa ) and the highest @xmath4 up to 28 k , is more robust than that of the sr and ca compounds@xcite . at first",

    "the calculations indicate that the striped antiferromagnetic state is the ground state as long as the pressure is less than 15 gpa , about 16% compression of volume , then the spin - polarization disappears . it is found that ferromagnetic state is unstable under a large range of pressure .",
    "the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order is always higher in total energy due to the smaller calculated magnetic moment , which results in smaller magnetic exchange energy .",

    "after having tried several other antiferromagnetic configurations , we find that the striped antiferromagnetic state is the most stable due to its largest magnetic moment .",

    "the high pressure experiment indicates that superconductivity appears at about 2.5 gpa , then @xmath4 reaches a maximum near 3.5 gpa , and disappears above 5.6 gpa@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sum](b ) , the compression of volume could be estimated to cover such a range of pressure . in terms of the antiferromagnetic results , as volume is compressed from 2% to 8% , the pressure range relevant to superconducting dome is covered completely , while in the nonmagnetic calculation , the volume needs to be compressed more , from 4% to 10% .",
    "it is clear that fe - as bond length is enhanced significantly than fe - fe after considering the spin - polarization .",
    "hence , as atom goes away from fe layer giving a larger @xmath5 . with a 10% compression of volume , the magnetic moment of iron deceases from 1.8 @xmath45 to 1.2 @xmath45 , which reduces the discrepancy of fe - as bond length between nonmagnetic and antiferromagnetic states .",
    "in contrast to tendency of iron related bonding , ba - as bond length becomes shorter after considering the spin - polarization . in the striped antiferromagnetic state ,",
    "chemical bonding becomes more rigid against pressure , therefore @xmath2 ratio changes less than nonmagnetic state , as a result , the compressibility is less anisotropic .",
    "although the fe - fe bond length and fe - as bond length decrease significantly with the increase of pressure , the as - fe - as bond angles @xmath46 change slightly . under 10% compression of volume ,",

    "we can find that the fermi surfaces expand significantly due to the expansion of band width by pressure . as volume compressed to 4% ,",
    "corresponding to 3.1 gpa pressure where superconductivity has been observed , the fermi surfaces lie on antinodal directions of @xmath22 - y1 line expand and across @xmath22 - m line to invade neighbor quarters of bz .",
    "thus , when pressure increases to 2.5 gpa where the superconductivity takes place , the main change of fermi surfaces of the striped antiferromagnetic state is to expand in bz .",
    "furthermore , as volume compressed over 8% , the fermi surfaces centered around z point across @xmath22 point to form a connected cylindrical tube .",
    "the topological change of fermi surfaces should respond to the slope change of @xmath2 ratio about 8% compression of volume ( see fig .",
    "[ sum ] ) .",
    "it is notable that the superconductivity disappears as pressure is higher than 6 gpa , that is roughly same with the place where the fermi surfaces topological transition occurs .",
    "however , it is necessary to point out that the shape of the fermi surfaces is dependent on the magnetic moment which is sensitive to the exchange - correlation potential ( lsda or gga ) and the fe - as bond length , and thus different calculations give quite different fermi surfaces .",

    "it should give some clues for the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity , as discussed previously for lafeaso system.@xcite finally , we investigate pressure effect on the band structures of the nonmagnetic state . as discussed above , the fe - as bond length",
    "is always underestimated in the optimized structure of nonmagnetic state under pressure , consequently @xmath21 bands are below fermi level at @xmath22 point ( see fig . [ tetfs ] ) , only shift downwards a little with increasing pressure . while @xmath50 bands shift downwards significantly under pressure , which across fermi level as compression of volume over 8% , corresponding to a pressure value of 4.7 gpa in nonmagnetic calculations .",
    "such a crossover will lead to a fermi surface topological transition of the hole - type cylinder - tube closed at @xmath22 point .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the nonmagnetic results might not be true . because arpes experiments always indicate the hole - type fermi surfaces around @xmath22 connects with larger gap in the iron - pnictide materials family , which should be important to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "thus the topological transition induced by pressure predicted by nonmagnetic calculation would not coincide with the fact that @xmath4 reach maximum nearby such a pressure .",
    "it has been observed that the superconducting states coexist with the striped magnetic state@xcite , but at present we can not say that the mechanism of the superconductivity is based on the magnetism .",
    "it is just believed that the superconductivity in the fe based materials is unlikely mediated by phonons , but likely originated from some magnetic or spin fluctuations .",
    "our calculated results indicate that the gga calculations yield reasonable lattice constants and @xmath5 only when we consider the magnetism .",
    "this implies that the magnetic effect is essential in these materials .",
    "since the d@xmath51 bands around fermi level are determined by the fe - as antibonding , as the distance of fe - as increases , the @xmath14 related hoppings are weakened and the bands become narrow , the large experimental @xmath5 parameter leads to typical two - dimensional properties . in current _ ab initio _ electron - phonon calculations , the optimized structure of nonmagnetic state is used , which results in the underestimation of the fe - as bond length and more three - dimensional character of fermi surfaces , that would influence properties of phonon and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "such a magnetism related effect might have substantial influence on the electron - phonon coupling . a calculation including the magnetic effect",
    "are highly expected to investigate how much the magnetic background influences the electron - phonon interaction , to reveal the possibility of that phonon might play some important role on the superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "lda calculations yield smaller magnetic moment and underestimates the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "the corresponding fermi surfaces is substantially different from that of arpes experiments@xcite .",
    "if the superconductivity is not directly dependent on the static moment , but determined by the lattice parameters and spin fluctuations , the changing of the moment value does not affect the superconductivity .",
    "the main implication of pressure effect on the crystal structure of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is to shorten the fe - fe bond length and the fe - as bond length , but to maintain as - fe - as bond angles simultaneously .",
    "we could compare the pressure effect on crystal structure with the doping effect in ( ba@xmath52k@xmath53)fe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite . with the doping of k into bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , @xmath4 goes up and reaches a maximum of 38 k at @xmath54=0.4 .",
    "the impressive change is that as - fe - as angle @xmath46 becomes the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5@xmath47 as @xmath54=0.4 . under pressure ,",
    "the feas@xmath1 - tetrahedra is hard to be changed and still far away from the ideal structure .",
    "it seems to imply that superconductivity could not be improved simply by hydrostatic pressure in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .    in the iron - pnictide superconducting family ,",

    "it has been reported that a structural transition of @xmath11-axis collapse occurs in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite under pressure .",
    "such a structural phase transition happens nearby the upper boundary of superconducting dome . in the striped antiferromagnetic calculations of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0",
    ", we find a collapse of @xmath11-axis as the compression of volume above 8% , which should be relevant to the topological transition of fermi surfaces .",
    "as the topological transition of fermi surfaces influence the magnetic moment of iron slightly , the related @xmath2 collapse should not be relative to a magnetic transition .",
    "in fact , we observe a magnetic collapse accompanying by a sudden softness of @xmath2 ratio as lattice volume is compressed over 16% , corresponding to near 15 gpa pressure .",
    "it is far away from the known superconducting dome ( 2 - 6 gpa ) up to date .",
    "we have performed lsda calculations to examine the influence of overestimated magnetic moment by gga .",
    "we found that the lsda calculated magnetic moment is about 0.35 @xmath45 smaller than gga , and the magnetic collapse happens at about 14% compression of volume , corresponding to pressure about 13 gpa .",
    "these results are consistent with recent experimental report that a suppression of magnetic order by pressure is observed as pressure above about 13 gpa@xcite .",
    "now , we attempt to consider the implication of the striped antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic calculations for paramagnetic state .",
    "it has been found experimentally that superconductivity coexist with static magnetic order under pressure for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite , so that a strong magnetic background is essential to superconductivity in these families .",
    "first of all , in order to describe chemical bonding more accurately , the magnetic effect should be considered .",
    "since ferromagnetism is not stable under a large range of pressure , only antiferromagnetic calculations is possible .",
    "as the optimized internal parameter @xmath5 of the striped antiferromagnetic state is in good agreement with experiments , it might be reasonable to use these parameters to describe the crystal structures and electronic structures in paramagnetic state than those nonmagnetic results .",
    "it coincides with the fact that no significant structural transformation is observed as system goes from antiferromagnetic state to superconducting state or paramagnetic state , except the compression of @xmath40 orthorhombic transition induced by the antiferromagnetic interaction . if the optimized lattice parameters obtained from the striped antiferromagnetic calculations are adopted , it turn out that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath21 bands always cross fermi level except for shifting downwards a little under pressure .",
    "for such a treatment of paramagnetic state , we found that the energy splitting between @xmath50 and @xmath21 bands decreases from 0.06 ev to 0.04 ev at @xmath22 point as volume is compressed 6% , which indicates that the @xmath21 bands are determined by direct fe - fe @xmath21 interaction while the @xmath23 bands are mainly determined by fe @xmath50 - as @xmath55 interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the band shapes are maintained under pressure , and the fermi surfaces are quite similar to those calculations with experimental lattice parameters ( see fermi surfaces of left column in fig .",
    "[ tetfs ] ) , except the sheets around @xmath22 point expand more .",
    "thus the fermi surfaces are robust against the pressure , no topological transition is found as the lattice volume compressed up to at least 10% .",
    "the impressive features is very different from those nonmagnetic calculations .",
    "it should be reminded that the band structures near fermi level , as well as fermi surfaces are sensitive to fe - as bond length and as - fe - as angle , which highly depend on the details of the spin - polarization .",
    "our calculations indicate that the shape of bands and fermi surfaces are almost decided by the value of large range magnetic moment . therefore ,",
    "if the pressure induces a high spin polarized state transform to a low spin state ( even nonmagnetic state ) , not only @xmath21 bands shift down to cross fermi level , but also @xmath50 bands cross fermi level .",
    "this would certainly influence the coupling between different fermi surfaces , then strongly influence the electronic properties .",
    "it would be very interesting to examine the detail of magnetism under pressure by experiment furthermore .",
    "in summary , we have employed an accurate all - electronic full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the density - functional theory to investigate the effect of pressure on the crystal structure and electronic properties of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters of the striped antiferromagnetic state is in good agreement with experiment , while nonmagnetic state calculation underestimates @xmath11-axis and fe - as bond lengths and yields a smaller @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the @xmath11-axis is compressed more easily than @xmath8-axis in nonmagnetic calculation , while the antiferromagnetic state calculation lead to a nearly isotropic compressibility with pressure up to 6 gpa . with increasing pressure",
    ", the feas@xmath1 tetrahedra changes little . for the striped antiferromagnetic state , we find that the fermi surfaces get closer and closer to the @xmath22 point in the @xmath56 directions when pressure increases from 2 gpa to 6 gpa , corresponding to the pressure region where superconductivity occurs .",
    "we observe a fermi surface topological transition around @xmath22 point as the pressure beyond 6 gpa .",
    "the transition should correspond to a small @xmath11-axis collapse .",
    "a magnetic collapse inducing the softening of @xmath11-axis is found when pressure reaches 13 gpa .",
    "these first - principles results should be useful to understanding the antiferromagnetism and electronic states in the feas - based materials , and may have some useful implications to the superconductivity .",
