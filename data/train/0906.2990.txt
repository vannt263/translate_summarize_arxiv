    "discrimination of quantum states has been an interesting and attractive problem in quantum information science for a relatively long time @xcite . since",
    "deterministic and error - free discrimination of an arbitrary set of quantum states is generally impossible due to the basic principles of quantum mechanics , just like other `` no - go '' theorems @xcite , the problem of finding an effective scheme of state discrimination has attracted a lot of attention and has played an import role in the study of quantum communication and cryptography .",
    "considerable work has been devoted to this problem and it has developed rapidly recently .",
    "the task of state discrimination is to discriminate the state of a quantum system from a given finite set of possible states with certain prior probabilities , and there are mainly two kinds of strategies to complete this task .",
    "one kind of strategy is called _ minimum error discrimination _",
    "@xcite which requires that the average probability of identifying a wrong state is minimized .",
    "there have been numerous results for this kind of discrimination strategy@xcite , some of which are quite interesting , like the weighted square - root measurement @xcite and that measurement sometimes does not aid in discriminating certain set of states @xcite .",
    "another important kind of discrimination strategy is _ unambiguous discrimination _ pioneered by @xcite , which requires that no error occurs in the identification of the states at the expense of obtaining an inclusive result with some non - zero probability .",
    "a lot of research has also been performed on this kind of discrimination strategy @xcite , including unambiguous discrimination of symmetric states @xcite and unambiguous discrimination between mixed states @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above two strategies , research has also been performed on mixed strategies involving minimum - error discrimination and unambiguous discrimination together @xcite , in order to achieve balance between the accuracy and the efficiency of state identification .",
    "it is , in general , very difficult to maximize the average probability of successfully discriminating the given states analytically , but some special techniques such as semidefinite programming have been employed to solve this computation problem numerically @xcite .    in this article",
    "we shall study the properties of the optimum strategy for unambiguous discrimination of @xmath0 pure states , and give a detailed method to obtain such an optimum strategy . according to @xcite ,",
    "one can manage to discriminate a set of states unambiguously with non - zero success probabilities if and only if the given states are linearly independent . we shall hold this assumption throughout this article .",
    "the main method we use for studying this problem is to put the individual probabilities that each state is successfully identified together as a vector in the @xmath0-dimensional real space @xmath1 ( and do the same to the @xmath0 prior probabilities ) , and study the properties of the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath2 under the optimum strategy by vector analysis techniques ( @xmath3 is the gram matrix of the @xmath0 states to be discriminated and @xmath4 is the diagonal matrix with the success probabilities as its diagonal elements , they will be defined explicitly later in theorem [ positivity ] ) . from the properties of the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath5",
    ", we shall establish two sets of equations that the optimum solution of the unambiguous discrimination problem must satisfy in different situations , and these equations will turn out to have some intuitive geometrical meanings .    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem - description :- povm ] we shall give a general description of the unambiguous state discrimination problem that we are interested in and the povm formalism that we shall use in this article . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exploration of optimal point ] , we derive the properties of the optimum measurement strategy and the new equations that can be used to work out the optimum solution .",
    "examples are also given to geometrically and numerically illustrate our method of solving the unambiguous discrimination problem .",
    "[ sec : maximum - average - success ] is devoted to deriving an analytical formula which characterizes a simple relation between the maximum average success probability and the @xmath0 pure states to be unambiguously discriminated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalization - of - equal - probability ] , a generalized version of equal - probability - measurement ( epm ) problem @xcite is studied and an analytical solution is obtained .",
    "finally we apply the results obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : exploration of optimal point ] to the case of three linearly independent pure states in sec .",
    "[ sec : special - case : ] and work out analytical solutions for some interesting cases .",
    "in this article , our problem is how to unambiguously identify the state of a quantum system with the maximum average success probability since the discrimination of non - orthogonal states is generally probabilistic . and",
    "all we know is that this state belongs to a given set of @xmath0 linearly independent states @xmath6 with given prior probabilities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we would like to obtain some analytical conditions that the optimum solution should satisfy , and provide a detailed method for obtaining the optimum solution of the problem .    in the following study of the problem , the @xmath0 prior probabilities will be denoted by a real vector @xmath9 in the space @xmath1 and the success probabilities @xmath10 ( @xmath8 ) for unambiguous outcomes",
    "will also be denoted as a real vector @xmath11 in @xmath1 for short .",
    "the average success probability for unambiguous discrimination can be written as @xmath12 then .    since",
    "only the probabilities of the measurement outputs are concerned in this problem , we shall use the povm ( _ positive - operator - valued measure _ ) formalism @xcite which is a good description for the statistics of a general physics process .",
    "a povm consists of a set of _ povm elements @xmath13 _ satisfying @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the identity operator ( or matrix ) .",
    "a hermitian operator is said to be _ positive _ and denoted by `` @xmath17 '' if all of its eigenvalues are non - negative . to unambiguously identify the state , we require that @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the probability of obtaining the result @xmath20 when the original state of the system is actually @xmath21 and @xmath10 denotes the probability of correctly identifying @xmath21 .    let @xmath22 denote the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space spanned by the given set of linearly independent pure states @xmath6 .",

    "any operator acting on @xmath25 is equivalent to an operator on @xmath22 by projecting onto the space @xmath22 when only the effect on @xmath22 is considered .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we shall restrict our povm elements to those acting on the space @xmath22 spanned by the given set of states . in order to discriminate the states @xmath6 unambiguously , the povm element @xmath26 that identifies the @xmath27th state @xmath21 must be orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the other @xmath28 states according to eq .",
    ", therefore the rank of @xmath26 should be no larger than @xmath29 , for all @xmath8 .",
    "thus each povm element that successfully identifies a certain state should have the form @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the success probability to identify the @xmath27th state and @xmath32 is an unnormalized state orthogonal to @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "it can be seen by substituting eq . into that @xmath35 and",

    "@xmath6 is probabilistic if they are not orthogonal to each other , there exists a povm element @xmath42 which gives the inconclusive result , and it can be written as@xmath43 since any povm element must be positive to represent a physically realizable process , it is required that@xmath44 this positivity inequality is an essential constraint on the unambiguous discrimination scheme and is the starting point of the discussions in this article .",
    "when the set of states @xmath6 and prior probabilities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are given , the povm elements for the measurement ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) depend only on the variables @xmath10 , i.e. the success probabilities , since @xmath32 ( @xmath8 ) can be determined and explicitly given by the @xmath27th column of @xmath38 defined in . therefore",
    ", searching for the optimum solution is to find a set of success probabilities @xmath10 ( corresponding to a point or a vector @xmath11 in @xmath1 ) such that their weighted average ( with the prior probabilities @xmath7 as the weights ) is maximized under the restrictions @xmath47 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath48 .",
    "the optimum solution is denoted by @xmath49 , and shall be called _ optimum point _ sometimes throughout the rest of the article ; and the main goal of this article is to find the optimum point @xmath49 .",

    "in this subsection , we are going to give a similar but more complete geometrical way to illustrate the problem and the results we obtain in the previous subsection , and we calculate a numerical example illustrated with corresponding graphics to explicitly show the geometrical meanings .",
    "geometrically , @xmath225 can be perceived as an @xmath226-dimensional plane in the @xmath1 space , and the critical feasible region @xmath81 can be perceived as a curved surface in @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown easily that the vertical distance from the origin of the coordinate system ( with @xmath227 as the coordinates ) to the plane @xmath228 is@xmath229 so the average success probability @xmath230 characterizes the vertical distance between the origin and the plane @xmath228 in a geometrical view .",
