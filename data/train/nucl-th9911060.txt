    "few years ago chanfray et al.@xcite showed that the @xmath1 excitation is present also in the longitudinal response of a nucleus to an electro - magnetic ( e.m . ) probe .",
    "the key issue in @xcite is elegant and simple .",
    "let us assume that a nucleon at rest is excited to a @xmath0 through a m1 excitation .",
    "the above is purely transverse but since the longitudinal / transverse separation is frame - dependent , a ( relativistic ) boost is able to give , in a moving frame , a longitudinal component too . since in a nucleus",
    "the nucleons are moving thanks to the fermi motion , then the conversion of a single ( moving ) nucleon to a @xmath0 contains necessarily a ( small ) longitudinal component .    here",
    "we wish to improve this analysis by accounting both for the possibility of creating a @xmath0 through a e2 or c2 multipole and ( most relevant ) for many - body effects , that can also lead to a ( broadened ) resonant structure .    concerning the former problem ( developed in sect .",
    "2 ) one has to face the limited experimental knowledge of the e2 and c2 excitations .",
    "the e2 current is believed to be small ( the coupling constant being expected , on the ground of the presently available data , to range between the -1% and -2.5% of the m1 one ) .",
    "it is anyway negligible here , since it is transverse too and of higher order than m1 in the non - relativistic reduction .",
    "moreover the e.m . coupling constant is squared in the inclusive response so that a factor of about @xmath2 is expected .",
    "thus we shall not present in the following the effects of this contribution since , as expected , our calculations do not provide any perceptible change in the responses .",
    "the c2 excitation is longitudinal and therefore could play a role even for small coupling constants ( in the peccei lagrangian@xcite , for example , it is about 10% of the m1 ) .",
    "it is thus accounted for in the following leaving the corresponding coupling constant free to range between 0 and a 15% of the m1 coupling constant .    the second problem , discussed in sect .",
    "3 , is of course by far more involved and the calculations are consequently less firmly grounded .",
    "we make use in the present paper of the boson loop expansion ( ble ) developed by two of us in some previous papers ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "as it is well known , the longitudinal response is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the polarisation propagator ( here written in configuration space ) .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath0 transition e.m .",
    "current operator , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is expressed in terms of the nucleon and @xmath0 fields , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath10 are usually written in fourier transform , according to @xcite , as @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath0 and nucleon masses respectively and @xmath16    in absence of interaction ( relativistic free fermi gas model or simply rffg ) the evaluation of @xmath17 is rather simple : @xmath18 @xmath19 being the usual in - medium relativistic propagator for nucleons , namely @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 the usual rarita - schwinger propagator in the vacuum .",

    "the removal of the divergences concerns in any case the real part only of the polarisation propagator .",
    "the longitudinal response at the end of the story ( separating the three contribution m1 , e2 and c2 ) is obtaining by taking the imaginary part of the @xmath0-hole term of @xmath23 and is the sum of the three terms , namely @xmath29 ( each of them , of course , multiplied by its corresponding form factor ) where @xmath30 .",
    "the m1 coupling constant has been chosen according to @xcite , i.e. @xmath31 , we have left instead the c2 coupling constant free to range between 0 . and 0.4 ( since no well established experimental data give serious indication about this value , we ha chosen a rather high one : actually , as we shall see , it does not significantly change the results , so that its uncertainty does not really matter in the present case ) .    the free response functions for @xmath32 , evaluated at @xmath33 are displayed in fig . 1 .",
    "here the quasi - elastic peak ( qep ) is treated relativistically and without dynamics ( i.e. , in rffg approximation ) .",
    "the @xmath0 peak is evaluated according to the above equations .",
    "[ fig1 ]    since the e.m .",
    "transition form factors of the @xmath0 are not so well determined as those of the nucleon @xcite , we have simply used the standard nucleon dipole form factor for them .    in the figure",
    "the expected contribution appears as a small bump on the right of the qep .",
    "the m1 contribution here is by far dominant , the c2 term , even at its maximum coupling constant , being hardly distinguishable in the figure .",
    "we now come to deal with the @xmath0-excitations through many - body channels . in the last two years , after a long time of unsatisfactory efforts , some calculations have been able to reproduce fairly well both the transverse and longitudinal responses in the qep region ( see @xcite among others ) . here",
    "we adopt the approach developed by two of us , that naturally embeds the @xmath0-degree of freedom into the formalism .",
    "the main theoretical tool in @xcite is the bosonisation , which amounts to transform the original action containing nucleons and @xmath0 s as true degrees of freedom interacting via a potential into an effective bosonic one ( i.e. containing only bosonic degrees of freedom  actually auxiliary fields introduced by means of a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation ) fully equivalent to the former .",
    "then the natural approximation scheme over the bosonic action is the boson loop expansion . as described in @xcite , the semi - classical limit ( mean field )",
    "amounts to collect all diagrams having no boson loops and is easily recognised to be the familiar ( not antisymmetrized ) rpa .",
    "the next - to - leading order collects all the diagrams with one boson loop : since fermion loops are of no matter in determining the order of the ble , then each boson line has to be thought as an rpa - dressed potential . in this way",
    "a boson line embodies an infinity of p - h and @xmath0-h insertions .",
    "thus not only a remarkable part of 2p-2h , but also some 3p-3h and higher are included .",
    "however , not all the 2p-2h contributions are accounted for : for instance , of the diagrams listed in ref .",
    "@xcite the ivb ) and vb ) of fig .",
    "9 are absent .",
    "more generally all diagrams with two ( rpa - dressed ) interaction lines and only one fermion loop are lacking . instead , our approach warrants the preservation of gauge invariance and of general theorems and sum rules .    concerning a comparison with other approaches , the only possible",
    "one ( being expressed in terms of feynman diagrams too ) is with ref .",
    "@xcite . in our case both",
    "higher order corrections to @xmath0 self - energy , pion - in - flight and kroll - rudermann term are absent ( and this because the complications and the large amount of work they require to be embedded in the formalism ) , while instead the possibility of having @xmath0-excitations in different fermionic loops ( in practice the so - called box diagrams of the bonn potentials @xcite ) are accounted for , that not only play a relevant role in the qep , as is well known , but are also fundamental in providing the response in the @xmath0-h region .",
    "note that the absence of part of the mec causes an underestimate of the response in the dip region , as will be apparent later in fig .",
    "4 . in any case at present no separate calculations for the longitudinal and transverse responses in the @xmath0 region have been provided by oset and coworkers . still a comparison between our approach and the one of ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be beyond our present possibilities .    of central interest to us",
    "is that the one loop order diagrams can contain @xmath0 s even if the incoming and outgoing virtual photons interact only with nucleons .",
    "this originates a resonant structure , broadened by a further p - h pair contemporarily present .",
    "typical diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "2 .      there",
    "it is shown that a @xmath0-h can be excited , with vector - isovector character , provided that another p - h pair again vector - isovector in nature re - establishes the correct quantum numbers .",
    "remarkably the whole class of diagrams considered in @xcite and schematized in fig .",
    "3 contains at least one @xmath0-h pair , since they surely appear in the rpa - dressed potential .",
    "there the dashed lines are the rpa - dressed , and consequently also contain @xmath0-h pairs , while the solid ones can be either a nucleon or a @xmath0 compatibly with the conservation laws .",
    "the vertices are assumed to be pure nucleon - nucleon or @xmath0-@xmath0 currents since this part of calculation is intrinsically non - relativistic .",
    "the results of our calculations extend some partial outcomes hidden in @xcite : there the existence of a tail on the right of qep was partially displayed but not discussed in one of the many figures , and , mainly , its resonant structure was not exhibited . here",
    "the whole @xmath0 peak is displayed and its resonant nature can be recognised ",
    "an outcome not warranted _ a priori _  and the balance with the direct m1 excitation established .",
    "furthermore the crucial physical point is that the effect discovered in @xcite is expected to rise with the transferred momentum , as the quoted paper shows , while the many - body corrections are expected to decrease .",
    "the calculations are carried out with the same parameters given in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "since the relativistic kinematics can be of great relevance , because it tends to shift both the qep and the @xmath0 one to lower energies , i.e. , at greater distances from the light cone , the electro - magnetic form factor will also decrease somehow the height of the peaks .",
    "as repeatedly said throughout the paper we are not able at present to perform a full relativistic calculation of the one - loop ble : the best thing we can do is to shrink somehow the @xmath34-axis in fig . 4 in such a way to account for the relativistic kinematics , if not for the relativistic dynamics .",
    "what we have done in practice is a rescaling of the @xmath34-axis in such a way that the maximum of the qep , the maximum of the @xmath0 peak and the right corner of the free qep will exactly coincide in energy with the position required by the relativistic kinematics .",
    "in particular it is extremely important to fix the right corner of the free qep because this strongly reduces the oscillations that are still observable in that point and that are due to the failure of the ble nearby a singular point .",
    "this procedure makes our pseudo - relativistic results in the left side of the qep rather unreliable , but on the other hand we are more interested , in the present paper , to the dip and @xmath0-peak region .",
    "let us now comment our main results , namely those displayed in fig .",
    "the solid line denotes a pseudo - relativistic calculation : this means that the mean field is exactly evaluated in rffg approximation both in the qep and in the @xmath0-peak and that the one - loop correction are evaluated non - relativistically but the energy scale is shrinked as described above .",
    "the dashed line instead presents a fully non - relativistic calculation . in this case coherently no free @xmath0-peak is accounted for and the corresponding bump on the right of the qep comes solely from the one - loop corrections ; finally the dotted lines describe the pure rffg model .",
    "as we expected from the very beginning the qep is well reproduced by the non - relativistic calculations , because the parameters of the model ( in practice the effective interactions in the various possible channels ) where adjusted on a non - relativistic dynamics . since relativity reduces the free qep the solid line underestimates it . on the other hand in the @xmath0-region the incoherence between the relativistic kinematics and the non - relativistic treatment of the one - loop corrections",
    "is the price we must pay to give a numerically acceptable description of the response .",
    "looking to this region , we see that the many - body excitations are clearly displayed and in general larger than the pure m1 response ( again a result not warranted _ a priori _ since both effects were expected to be small ) .",
    "another relevant question concerns the behaviour of the many - body correlations at high momentum transfer .",
    "for this reason we have attempted to perform a calculation also for a transferred momentum of 600 mev / c , where we know that the non - relativistic approximation is at least questionable . disregarding in any case the qep we see ( if in the @xmath0-region our approach",
    "still can provide meaningful results ) that the fading out of the many - body correction is not so strong as naively expected , and it opens the serious questions about how fast the nuclear correlations will disappear .",
    "it suggests indeed that nucleon - nucleon correlation will die much before than the @xmath0-nucleon one .",
    "furthermore , the dashed line ( that does not contain the free @xmath0-peak ) shows a clear resonant behaviour at a transferred momentum @xmath35= 400 mev / c , while the resonant structure seems to fully disappear at @xmath35= 600 mev / c , where instead the dip region is significantly filled .    since these conclusions depend in a crucial way upon the behaviour of the response at high values of @xmath35 , where our calculation suffer for the lack of relativity , then the present outcome clearly asks for fully relativistic many - body calculations , a task that is at this moment forbidden to us due to some technicalities discussed in @xcite .",
    "another relevant point is that even neglecting correlations some strength is present in the resonant region and can give a significant ( possibly of the order of some percent ) contribution to the coulomb sum rule .",
    "this will require qualitative changes in the derivations of the former to account for the @xmath0 degrees of freedom as well .",
    "of course no serious comparison with the experimental data can be performed until a higher precision will be reached by the experimental data , such to enable the rosenbluth separation even in a region where the longitudinal response is naturally depressed with respect of the transverse one .",
    "nevertheless the indications coming from our calculation are surely not in contrast with the experimental data ."
