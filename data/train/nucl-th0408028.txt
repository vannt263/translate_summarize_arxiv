    "properties of deformed nuclei can be described within the symmetrical rotator model [ 3 ] and the interacting boson model ibm-1 [ 4 ] in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "some differences in the descriptions are due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian and the finite number of bosons which only have the angular momentum @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the ibm-1 we used a simple hamiltonian @xmath15    in the @xmath12 limit @xmath16 the energies of the @xmath5 and @xmath17 bands are degenerate and become identical , the energies of the ground - state band are designated as @xmath18 , those of the @xmath5 and @xmath17 bands as @xmath19 and these energies are calculated as a function of the spin @xmath20 by the formula@xmath21    where @xmath22 are the eigenvalues of the casimir operator    @xmath23    here @xmath24 is the number of valence nucleons ( for @xmath10 we have @xmath25 @xmath26 ) . using equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and the experimental energies of the first @xmath27 and second @xmath28 @xmath29 levels in the @xmath30 nucleus , we calculate the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 by the formulae @xmath33    @xmath34    and get @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "since the energies of the @xmath37 and @xmath17 vibrational states in the rotational bands in @xmath11 are actually not identical , we include a pairing term in ( 1 ) for their calculation , find the parameter @xmath38 by the least squares method , and calculate most of the energy spectrum of @xmath10 positive - parity levels presented in table 2 in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "analysis of table 2 shows that the approach used allows a satisfactory description of only the lowest excited positive - parity states in the @xmath10 nucleus .",
    "the discrepancy between the calculated and experimental level energies considerably increases with increasing excitation energy .",
    "therefore , we confined ourselves to calculation of energies of levels with spins @xmath39 with @xmath40 , though states with higher @xmath41 are experimentally known ( for instance , for levels with @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath41 may be even larger 16 , see table 1 ) .",
    "in general , the difference between the experimental and theoretical energies of the states included in table 2 vary from a few @xmath44 to a few hundred kev .",
    "the average deviation of theory from experiment is @xmath45 , which can hardly be regarded as satisfactory .",
    "obviously , this value will increase if we take into consideration higher - lying excited states with @xmath46 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the model ibm-1 makes it possible to calculate energies of all head states of rotational bands which have to be described by individual free parameters in other models .",
    "we used four widely known , well - working model approaches to describe the experimental energy spectra of excited states of rotational bands in the @xmath30 nucleus .",
    "first of all , it is the geometrical bohr - mottelson model [ 3 ] , where intraband state energies as a function of the spin @xmath20 and the quantum number @xmath47 are calculated by formula @xmath48^{n}+(-1)^{i+k}\\frac{(i+k)!}{(i\\_k)!}%",
    "\\sum_{m=0}b_{m}[i(i+!)]^{m},\\]]where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the model parameters .",
    "another approach is the @xmath51 - phonon model [ 5 ] , where positions of the rotational - band levels are calculated by expression @xmath52with the parameters @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the third approach is calculation by three - parameter formula following from the model of the variable moment of inertia with dynamical asymmetry [ 6]@xmath56 where the parameters @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 are governed by the moment of inertia of the ground state of the nucleus and by its `` softness '' and asymmetry parameters and where @xmath60 is the sign - changing term allowing calculation of bands with any value of the quantum number @xmath47 @xmath61 at @xmath62 and odd @xmath20 ; @xmath63 at @xmath62 and even @xmath64 @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the fourth approach is calculation by formula proposed in [ 7]@xmath67^{2}+a_{1/2}\\sqrt{i(i+1)}+b_{0}(-1)^{i},\\]]where in addition to the normal terms of the borh - mottelson formula , there appears a term with the parameter @xmath68 taking into account the coriolis interaction and a sign - changing term with the parameter @xmath69 similar to the sign - changing term in ( 8) .",
    "according to the data collected in [ 1 ] , there are about 15 known bands of different nature in @xmath10 , which where established in various types of nuclear reactions and in the @xmath5 decay . some of these bands are traced to rather high energies and spins .",
    "for example , in [ 8 ] the study of the reaction in the beam of @xmath70 ions revealed excitation of levels up to the energy of @xmath71 with the spin @xmath72 in the @xmath73 ground - state band , up to @xmath74  with @xmath75 in the @xmath76 @xmath77 band , up to @xmath78  with @xmath79 in the @xmath80 band , and up to @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 in the @xmath85 and @xmath86 octupole bands respectively . in our calculations we confined ourselves to the intraband states with energies not higher than the @xmath87 @xmath10 @xmath5 decay energy of @xmath88 . in tables",
    "3.1 - 3.16 we present the energies of excited states in all experimentally established rotational bands of the @xmath10 nucleus calculated by ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the last two rows of each table show the average deviations of the calculated energies from the experimental values @xmath89 for each formula and the values of the parameters at which the best agreement between theory and experiment was achieved .",
    "the second columns of the tables show the values of the inertia parameters @xmath90 calculated by the formulae    @xmath91    @xmath92@xmath93    notes @xmath94 in tables 3.1 - 3.16 are explained under table 3.16 . after the calculation of the average deviations @xmath89",
    "all calculated state energies were rounded off to the first decimal digit .",
    "it should be particularly mentioned that when calculating rotational bands for which the number of the experimentally known levels was not enough , we artificially extended the band by adding states with approximately expected energies and obviously large errors .",
    "then we repeated the fitting procedure using the energies of the missing band levels found in the first fitting . though reducing to zero average deviations of theory from experiment for the known states in some cases , this procedure predicts to an extent positions of possibly existing but not yet experimentally found intraband levels .",
    "levels of this band are known from the experiment [ 8 ] up to @xmath72 .",
    "we confine our consideration to states with @xmath96 ( see table 3.1 ) , which were studied before the investigation [ 8 ] in many types of nuclear reactions , coulomb excitation , and @xmath5 decay [ 1 ] . the lowest states with @xmath97 and @xmath98 manifest themselves practically in all above - mentioned processes while the levels with higher spins @xmath99 and @xmath100 show up only in some of them and not in the @xmath5 decay ( see [ 1 ] for details ) , where excitations of these states are unlikely or absolutely impossible because of their high spins and energies .",
    "recently [ 2 ] the state with the energy of @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath103 was nevertheless found during the investigation of the @xmath104 @xmath87 @xmath10 decay .",
    "this state is de - excited to the level at @xmath105 with @xmath102 @xmath106 by an intraband @xmath17 transition of energy @xmath107 which showed itself in the spectrum of @xmath108 coincidences with the @xmath109 @xmath110 line de - exciting the @xmath105 state .",
    "the @xmath101  level is populated from higher states by a few low - intensity @xmath17 transitions whose total intensity is totally counterbalanced by the intensity of the @xmath107 transition . as is evident from table 3.1 , our calculations for this band by all four formulae show approximately the same good agreement with the experiment . in all cases the average deviation of the experimental energies from the theoretical ones",
    "@xmath89  does not exceed @xmath111 . to get comparable agreement of the calculations by ( 8) and ( 9 ) with the calculations by ( 6 ) and ( 7 )",
    ", we had to increase the number of the parameters from three to four .",
    "the inertia parameter @xmath112 tends to decrease smoothly from @xmath113 to @xmath114 as the energies and spins of the band levels increase from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the first three states of this band ( see table 3.2 ) with @xmath102 @xmath119 and @xmath120 are quite well known both from the reactions and coulomb excitation and from the @xmath5 decays of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 nuclei [ 1 ] .",
    "the @xmath102 @xmath123 level unambiguously manifests itself in the @xmath121 and @xmath6 @xmath5 decays and in reactions with @xmath124 particles .",
    "the @xmath102 @xmath106 state is observed in the @xmath125 @xmath5 decay , in reactions with @xmath124 particles , and in the coulomb excitation .",
    "the next six levels with @xmath102 @xmath126 and @xmath127 were earlier observed only in reactions with @xmath124 particles ; three of them with @xmath102 @xmath128 and @xmath129 have been recently confirmed in [ 2 ] , where the decay @xmath130 @xmath87 @xmath10 was studied .",
    "these states were introduced in the @xmath87 @xmath30  decay scheme on the basis of the @xmath108 coincidences and energy and intensity balances .",
    "the last two states with @xmath131 and @xmath132 in table 2 were first established in the reaction with @xmath70 in [ 8 ] , where existence of all other members of the band was confirmed and the more accurate value @xmath133 was found for the energy of the @xmath134 @xmath135 level , earlier known [ 1 ] to be a level at @xmath136 . as is evident from table 3.2 ,",
    "our calculations reproduce the energies of the levels from this band in the best way in all cases .",
    "the average deviation from experiment @xmath89 is no larger than @xmath111 for calculations by ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) , and @xmath137 for the calculations by traditional bohr - mottelson formula ( 6 ) . in calculations by ( 6 )",
    "this agreement was achieved by including a sign - changing term with the coefficient @xmath69 , which depends not only on the spin @xmath20 , as in ( 8) and ( 9 ) , but also on the quantum number @xmath138 .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 , as in the case of the ground - state band , generally tends to decrease slightly with increasing energy and spin of intraband states .",
    "yet , for the neighboring levels with even and odd spins a systematic difference in values of @xmath139 is observed , which increases with increasing energy .",
    "the values of @xmath112 for odd - spin members of the band are larger than for even - spin ones .",
    "the first head level ( table 3.3 ) of this band with @xmath141 and the third one with @xmath102 @xmath142 are known from the @xmath5 decay of the @xmath125 and @xmath6 nuclei and from reactions with @xmath124 particles and deuterons [ 1 ] .",
    "the best studied state from this band is the second level with @xmath102 @xmath143 , which is easy to observe in both @xmath5 decays , at the coulomb excitation , and in almost all reactions mentioned in [ 1 ] .",
    "the level with @xmath102 @xmath144 shows itself in reactions with @xmath124 particles and deuterons , at the coulomb excitation , and in the @xmath5 decay of the @xmath121 nucleus .",
    "higher - lying states with higher spins , beginning with @xmath102 @xmath145 and up to @xmath102 @xmath146 , except @xmath147 @xmath148 , were observed only in reactions with @xmath124 particles .",
    "it is only recently that excitation of @xmath10 states with @xmath147 @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the @xmath5 decay has been observed during the investigation of the @xmath130 @xmath151 @xmath10 decay [ 2 ] .",
    "the missing level with @xmath147 @xmath148 showed up in the reaction with @xmath70 [ 8 ] . level energies calculated for this band are in slightly poorer agreement with the experimental values than for the bands considered above . in all cases",
    "the average deviation @xmath89 is as a large as a few tens of kev ( see table 3.3 ) .",
    "the inertia parameter @xmath112 shows considerable difference in value for states with even and odd spins typical of octupole bands .",
    "this band deserves particular attention because of unusually small spins of its experimentally observed low - lying levels .",
    "the state with @xmath102 @xmath152 ( see table 3.4 ) was established in the @xmath5 decay of the @xmath125 nucleus and in the reaction with @xmath153 nuclei , the level with @xmath147 @xmath106 is known from the @xmath5 decay of the @xmath121 nucleus and reactions with @xmath124 particles , the state @xmath102 @xmath103 is found in the reactions with @xmath124 particles and @xmath153 , and the state with @xmath102 @xmath154 is found only in reactions with @xmath124 particles [ 1 ] .",
    "all these states are assigned to the same band and are interpreted [ 1 ] as members of the band of the states aligned in such a way that the rotational moment and the moment of two aligned neutrons @xmath155 are not parallel , as is typical of many known @xmath80 bands in other nuclei .",
    "recently the band was extended to @xmath102 @xmath156 in [ 8 ] .",
    "we included in table 3.4 only two states with @xmath102 @xmath135 and @xmath132 out of all those observed in [ 8 ] . in [ 1 ] a @xmath157 band based on the @xmath147 @xmath158 state with the energy @xmath159 is reported .",
    "this band comprises two more levels with @xmath102 @xmath43 and @xmath120 and energies @xmath160 and @xmath161 @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the @xmath102 @xmath43 level is known from the @xmath121 decay and the @xmath162 reaction .",
    "it is reliably confirmed in [ 2 ] as the @xmath102 @xmath43 level with the energy @xmath163 while the statement that there exists the @xmath102 @xmath164 level is based on 30-year - old data on the @xmath5 decay of @xmath121 and may be erroneous .",
    "the existence of the @xmath159 head state is not confirmed in [ 2 ] either . the @xmath165  @xmath17 transition associated with this state on the basis of earlier data",
    "is unambiguously placed elsewhere in the @xmath151 @xmath10 decay scheme on the basis of @xmath166 coincidences in [ 2 ] . the @xmath167 transition to the ground state , which was earlier the main evidence for existence of the excited @xmath168 level at @xmath169 ,",
    "was not observed at all despite our specific search for lines corresponding to this transition in the spectrum of internal conversion electrons from the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay [ 2 ] . on the contrary , we found a state at @xmath170 de - excited by two @xmath17 transitions .",
    "first to the @xmath102 @xmath171 @xmath29 level of the ground band and second to @xmath102 @xmath171 @xmath29 level@xmath172of @xmath17 vibrational band .",
    "this state @xmath173 been populated by a few @xmath17 transitions from higher - lying levels with @xmath147 @xmath174 , except the @xmath175 level with @xmath102 @xmath43 .",
    "earlier the state at this energy @xmath176 was observed in @xmath162 reactions in [ 9 ] , where the authors assigned the characteristics @xmath102 @xmath177 to this level and assumed that it and the @xmath29 state at @xmath178 observed by them , which probably corresponded to the @xmath163  level ( see table 3.4 ) , may be assigned to the @xmath80 band . though it seems somewhat strange that there is no noticeable @xmath167 transition ( our estimation is @xmath179 from the @xmath170 level to the ground state , the results of our latest investigations [ 2 ] are not in conflict with the assignment of the spin - parity @xmath102 @xmath158 to this level .",
    "thus , if one accepts the interpretation [ 9 ] , to which we are also inclined , the @xmath80 band appears to be as shown in table 3.4 , while the data given in [ 1 ] on the @xmath157 band built upon the @xmath159 level that proved not to exist , including the fact that one of its member @xmath180 level at @xmath181 is absent , seem to be incorrect .",
    "however , it may as well be hypothesized that the band in question is not an @xmath80 band but a normal band built upon the @xmath168 state at @xmath170  that is similar to other @xmath182 bands established in the @xmath10 and other nuclei .",
    "whichever interpretation is true , this band is rotational and we calculated the energies of its levels by the same rotational formulae ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) which we used for other bands considered in this paper .",
    "the results of the calculations are given in table 3.4 .",
    "they are in rather good agreement with the experimental data . in all cases",
    "the average deviation @xmath183 varies between @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "however , it should be noted that equivalent agreement between experiment and calculations was obtained with only one parameter used in calculations by ( 6 ) in contrast to three - parameter calculations by ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) .",
    "the values of the inertia parameters @xmath112 for the lowest states with @xmath186 @xmath187 and @xmath188 show some irregularity , which is probably due to different influence of the neighboring bands on the above - mentioned states . as the energy and spin increase and",
    "the influence becomes weaker or the same for all states , the parameters take on approximately identical values around @xmath189 @xmath44 ( see table 3.4 ) .      in [ 1 ]",
    "this band is treated as a band upon the two - particle state at @xmath191 with @xmath192 and the @xmath193-n3/2[521])$ ] configuration , which also comprises two more levels at @xmath194 with @xmath147 @xmath171 @xmath29 and at @xmath195 with @xmath196 .",
    "it is stated that all three levels were found in the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and the @xmath197 level also showed itself in @xmath198 and @xmath162 reactions as a state at @xmath199 . in our latest studies of the @xmath5 decay @xmath130 @xmath87 @xmath10 [ 2 ] we managed to confirm only the first two states with @xmath192 and @xmath200 .",
    "the previously drawn conclusion that there exists a third level at @xmath201 @xmath196 is likely to be wrong .",
    "this state was introduced on the basis of two @xmath17 transitions with energies @xmath202 and @xmath203 from this level to the @xmath29 levels of the @xmath17 band and the ground - state band respectively . according to our data [ 2 ] ,",
    "the @xmath204 @xmath17 transition is unambiguously placed elsewhere in the @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath10 decay scheme and there is no @xmath205 @xmath110 transition at all .",
    "thus , if this band exists , only its first two levels with @xmath102 @xmath206 and @xmath29 are reliably established . to extend the band",
    ", we tried to select possible candidates with the necessary quantum characteristics @xmath102 @xmath207 and @xmath98 ( see table 3.5 ) from the spectrum of the experimentally known ( see table 1 ) excited states .",
    "the level at @xmath208  was earlier known from the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and the @xmath198 reaction , the state at @xmath209 was observed in the @xmath162 reaction as a level of energy @xmath210 , the level at @xmath211 was first observed in [ 2 ] in the @xmath130 @xmath151 @xmath10 @xmath5 decay , and the state at @xmath212 showed itself in the @xmath198 and @xmath213 reactions as a level of energy @xmath214 and @xmath215 respectively . the common feature of all these states , including the first two , is existence of @xmath216 transitions de - exciting them to the levels of the ground - state band . reproduction of this band by means of the rotational formulae results in rather good agreement , @xmath217 @xmath218 ( see table 3.5 ) , but requires a lot of parameters .",
    "this is evident from the calculations by ( 7 ) , where the average deviation for the formula with fewer parameters is much worse than @xmath219 .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is a sharp difference in @xmath112 values between the members of this band , which is not typical of positive - parity bands .",
    "this band was reported in [ 11 ] to be a rotational band built upon the @xmath220 level with @xmath102 @xmath206 , a doublet state for the @xmath221 level with @xmath102 @xmath164 known as a two - quasiparticle state with parallel spins of two unpaired nucleons @xmath222+n3/2[521])$ ] .",
    "apart from the head level , this band comprised three more levels with @xmath102 @xmath119 and @xmath120 at @xmath223 @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively . in [ 1 ] the energies",
    "@xmath226 and @xmath227 are given for two positive - parity states known from the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay , but their spins were not uniquely established and their belonging to a band was not mentioned . to the next two states at @xmath224 and @xmath225 there might correspond the levels at @xmath228 and @xmath229 observed in the @xmath162 reaction , whose quantum characteristics are not fully known .",
    "the latter levels also shows up in the @xmath230 reaction as a state of energy @xmath231 .",
    "the states of close energies @xmath232 and @xmath233 were observed in our latest studies of the @xmath130 @xmath151 @xmath10 @xmath5 decay [ 2 ] , where existence of the levels at @xmath234 and @xmath235 was also confirmed .",
    "all these four states are de - excited in a similar way and fit well into the @xmath236 band under consideration , though their spins are not conclusively established .",
    "this is demonstrated both by the values of the inertia parameters @xmath112 calculated by us for each member of the band , which fall within a reasonable range from @xmath237 to @xmath238 , and by our calculations by rotational formulae ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) with the average deviation of the experimental band level energies from the theoretical values @xmath89 not exceeding @xmath218 even in the worst case ( see table 3.6 ) .",
    "however , there arises a question . which of the two @xmath239 bands considered above ( see tables 3.5 and 3.6 ) corresponds to the @xmath240-n3/2[521])$ ] configuration ? based on our theoretical analysis",
    "we believe that preference should be given to the earlier interpretation [ 11 ] , where this configuration is assigned to the band built upon the @xmath241 state at @xmath242 .      the first four states of this band ( see table 3.7 ) with @xmath102 @xmath244 and @xmath245 are quite reliably established both from the @xmath5 decay and from many reactions [ 1 ] .",

    "all these states , including the levels at @xmath264 and @xmath257 , are populated only directly from the @xmath121 decay and have channels of de - excitation to the levels of the ground - state band .",

    "as follows from [ 1 ] , the @xmath271 ground level of this band show itself in the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and the @xmath272 reaction , the second state with @xmath273 is established in a few types of reactions , coulomb excitation , and @xmath121 @xmath5 decay , and the level with @xmath147 @xmath164 is excited only in the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay .",

    "the @xmath102 @xmath158 level at @xmath280 is populated by @xmath17 transitions from four higher states , three with @xmath102 @xmath174 and one with @xmath102 @xmath43 .",
    "the intensity of these transitions is totally counterbalanced by the sole @xmath281 transition of @xmath282  to the @xmath147 @xmath43 of the ground band . quite unexpected , as with the @xmath283 @xmath284 head level of the @xmath80 band ( see 3.4 ) , is the absence of the @xmath167 transition from the @xmath168 level at @xmath280 to the @xmath10 ground state ( our estimation for this transition is @xmath285 while for two other @xmath168 states at @xmath286 and @xmath287 known form the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay @xmath288 and @xmath289 respectively .",
    "we regard the state at @xmath290 ( the value refined by us , see table 3.10 ) as the second level of the band on the @xmath280 @xmath284 level .",
    "it is linked to 16 excited levels with known quantum characteristics via its populating and de - exciting @xmath17 transitions for most of which multipolarities are established [ 2 ] .",
    "this allowed ambiguity to be removed and the unique spin - parity @xmath102 @xmath43 to be established for the @xmath291 state .",
    "as should be expected , in all cases the calculations exactly reproduce energies of the first two experimentally known @xmath102 @xmath177 and @xmath29 levels with the minimum number of parameters . in a sense",
    "these calculations predict  the energy range for the search for subsequent states with higher spins @xmath292 and @xmath274 that might exist in this band ( see table 3.10 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 is equal to @xmath293 , which does not significantly differ from the expected value .",
    "two states with @xmath271 and @xmath29 given in table 3.11 are known from the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay [ 10 ] and are treated as the members of the same band [ 1 ] . in our latest experiments [ 2 ] it was possible to confirm only the fact that those states existed and to refine their energy values . as is evident from the table",
    ", all calculations describe these states in the best way and predict possible energies of the states with higher spins which are not yet found experimentally . as in the case of the previous band ,",
    "the parameter @xmath112 has a reasonable value , which is @xmath296 for this band .",
    "this band is treated in [ 1 ] as a possible octupole band with @xmath298 and comprises two experimentally known levels ( see table 3.12 ) .",
    "the first level with @xmath102 @xmath174 was observed in the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and the @xmath299 reaction , the other level with @xmath102 @xmath143 was observed in the @xmath300 reaction and at coulomb excitation [ 1 ] .",
    "later [ 2 ] we observed the @xmath102 @xmath143 level in the @xmath125 @xmath5 decay as well .",
    "the above states are well reproduced by our calculations , which also yield possible energies of excited states with @xmath147 @xmath301 and @xmath150 lying higher in energy and belonging to the band in question ( see table 3.12 ) .",
    "the value of the inertia parameter @xmath90 is @xmath302 and is not in conflict with the required value .      by now four states have been identified in this band ( see table 3.13 )",
    ". the head states with @xmath102 @xmath142 is known from the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and @xmath213 and @xmath304 reactions , the next two levels with @xmath102 @xmath144 and @xmath305 showed up in the same processes and in reactions with @xmath124 particles , the state with @xmath102 @xmath306 showed itself only in reaction with @xmath124 particles [ 1 ] .",
    "note that in our latest investigations of the @xmath130 @xmath151 @xmath10 decay [ 2 ] we failed to identify the @xmath147 @xmath145 level at @xmath307 .",
    "the @xmath308 @xmath17 transition , which according to [ 1 ] de - excites this state to the @xmath102 @xmath309 level at @xmath310 and is the main argument in favor of its existence , should have manifested itself in the spectra of @xmath108 coincidences with rather intensive @xmath17 lines of @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "however , we did not observe anything of the kind .",
    "moreover , our data dictate two other places for this @xmath17 transition in the @xmath151 @xmath10 decay scheme and its multipolarity composition is predominantly @xmath313 , which is in conflict with its placement between the levels of @xmath314 and @xmath310 with different parities [ 2 ] .",
    "as is evident from table 3.13 , the calculations with the same number of parameters in all cases equally well @xmath315 @xmath316 describe the energies of four experimentally known states with @xmath147 @xmath317 and @xmath318 , and the extension of the band predicts energies of possibly existing states with @xmath102 @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "the inertia parameters for this band are close in value to those for other bands in @xmath10 . however , there is no sharp change in the @xmath321 values as one goes from even to odd spins as is the case in other negative - parity bands .      until our latest investigations [ 2 ] the band upon the two - particle state with @xmath323 and the energy @xmath324 was known to comprise two next levels with @xmath102 @xmath123 and @xmath98",
    "( see table 3.14 ) , all of which , including the head level , were earlier reliably established from the reactions with @xmath124 particles and the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay [ 1 ] .",
    "the fourth member of this band at @xmath325 with @xmath102 @xmath326 was earlier observed in two processes as a level at @xmath327 . in one of them ,",
    "the reaction with @xmath124 particles , it was assigned to the band in question and in the other , the @xmath213 reaction , it was interpreted as the head level of the @xmath328 @xmath143 band .",
    "it turned out that in @xmath10 there are actually two states at closely spaced energies @xmath329 and @xmath330 but with different quantum characteristics @xmath102 @xmath326 and @xmath102 @xmath143 , which were unambiguously established in our recent investigation [ 2 ] .",
    "it is evident from table 3.14 that all four formulae describe the level energies for this band in the best way and also predict energies of three possibly existing states with higher spins @xmath331 @xmath332 and @xmath333 .",
    "for the already known levels with @xmath102 @xmath334 and @xmath335 the average deviation of theory from experiment is no larger than @xmath336 in all cases .",
    "the parameter @xmath321 practically does not change from level to level and has a reasonable value .",
    "only the head state with @xmath102 @xmath164 was known in this band ( see table 3.15 ) .",
    "it was established in the @xmath121 @xmath5 decay and the @xmath339 reaction [ 1 ] .",
    "another state at @xmath340 with @xmath102 @xmath123 was firstly found by us in the recent investigation of the @xmath104 @xmath87 @xmath10 decay [ 2 ] . according to the @xmath108 coincidence data , this state , like",
    "the @xmath341 @xmath102 @xmath164 head state , is mainly de - excited to the levels of the @xmath342 @xmath17 band , which allows these states to be regarded as the members of the same band .",
    "as might be expected , the calculations accurately describe the energies of the first two known states of the band and point to possible positions of the next three levels .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 is @xmath343 @xmath44 , which is only slightly different from the values for the @xmath344 band upon the state at @xmath324 .",
    "as was pointed out above , in our work [ 2 ] we observed a state at @xmath330  with @xmath345 @xmath258 , which seems to correspond to the @xmath327 state observed in the @xmath346 reaction and interpreted as the head level of the @xmath328 @xmath143 band [ 1 ] .",
    "we take this interpretation as the basis and add to this band two more levels at @xmath347 with @xmath348 and @xmath349 with @xmath350 ( see table 3.16 ) , whose energies and quantum characteristics were first established by us during the investigation of @xmath130 @xmath87 @xmath10 @xmath5 decay [ 2 ] .",
    "the latter level is also known from the @xmath351 reaction , but only its energy @xmath352 was found from this reaction .",
    "all three states have a common feature : they are de - excited by @xmath17 transitions of noticeably intensity to the levels of the @xmath17 vibrational band [ 2 ] , which allowed us to regard the states as members of the same band . as is evident from table 3.16 ,",
    "our calculations reproduce the energies of the experimentally known @xmath353 and @xmath305 states of this band quite well and predict possible positions of the intermediate level with @xmath354 and higher - lying states with @xmath147 @xmath355 and @xmath150 in the @xmath10 excitation energy spectrum .",
    "two values of the parameter @xmath112 for the even - spin states are closely spaced and do not contradict the expected values .",
    "most of the experimentally observed energy values of @xmath10 collective states levels with positive parity are compared with theoretically calculated values using interacting bosons model ( ibm ) .",
    "the mean differences between experimental and calculated values are about @xmath356 .    as a result of the detail analysis of 16 rotational bans",
    "they were supplemented with 17  new levels .",
    "also , within this analysis the existence of @xmath159 @xmath284 level was not confirmed , while into@xmath357 decay scheme was integrated a band with a head level @xmath157 with the energy @xmath280 .",
    "large amount of explicit @xmath5 decay states we could not include into any rotatational band ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all the models used in our investigation of the levels energies and their quantum characteristics in very rich and complicate spectrum of @xmath0dy nucleus provide a relatively good agreement with experiment . however , in the region of high spins and energies the disagreement between calculations and experimental data increases .",
    "so it is somehow straightforward to apply for our further analysis of this experimental data the recently developed interacting vector boson model ( ivbm ) [ 13 ] .",
