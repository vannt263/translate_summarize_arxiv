    "here , we introduce our approach using a master equation model ( me ) to study this hybrid system ( shown in fig.[fig : mem ] ) .",
    "as the ensemble is driven by the flux qubit that is an effective single photon source , the number of excitations in the ensemble is much smaller than the number of electronic spins , and therefore it is reasonable to regard the spin ensemble as a number of harmonic oscillators as the previous authors considered .",

    "if we fit the mhom spectrum by this function , it seems that we might determine the parameters needed in the me because thom is equivalent to me for a weak driving regime .",
