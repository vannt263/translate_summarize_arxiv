    "the ags has had a broad and rich program in kaon physics . with the recent successful commissioning of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) ,",
    "the primary role of the ags has shifted to become an injector of heavy ions for rhic .",
    "nevertheless , the ags remains the highest intensity proton synchrotron in the world and is designed to be available for @xmath020 hours / day when not filling rhic , and as such retains an important role in the us high energy physics ( hep ) program .",
    "doe and bnl have approved and agreed to fund one new hep experiment to run at the ags between rhic fills : the e949 experiment which seeks to make a precise measurement of the branching ratio b ( ) .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the kaon physics program at the ags is centered on the two golden modes : and .",
    "these modes are interesting as there is essentially no theoretical ambiguity in extracting fundamental ckm parameters from measurements of the branching ratios@xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in b ( ) is @xmath07% and is even smaller in b ( ) , only @xmath02% ; in both cases the hadronic matrix element is extracted from the ( @xmath1 ) decay rate .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix can be expressed as @xmath2with the three vectors @xmath3 converging to form a very elongated triangle in the complex plane .",
    "the length of first vector @xmath4 is precisely determined from @xmath1 decay .",
    "the height of the triangle , @xmath5 , can be measured by and the length of the third side @xmath6 is measured by .",
    "measurements of the two modes , along with the well known @xmath1 , will completely determine the unitarity triangle .",
    "comparison of ckm parameters as measured from the golden , and modes , provide the best opportunity to over - constrain the unitary triangle and to search for new physics .",
    "in particular , comparisons of    * @xmath7 from and from the ratio of the mixing frequencies of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons  @xcite , * @xmath10 from b()/b ( ) and from the time dependent asymmetry in the decay  @xcite    offer outstanding opportunities to explore the standard model ( sm ) picture of cp - violation .",
    "the sm prediction for the branching ratios are b ( ) = @xmath11 and b ( ) = @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an upper limit on b ( ) can be derived in a theoretically unambiguous way from the current limit on @xmath9 mixing ; this limit is b ( ) @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a large number of new results are available from several recently completed rare kaon decay experiments at bnl ( running during 199598 ) .",
    "there were three experiments running during this period  e787 : search for , e865 : search for and e871 : search for .",
    "two of these experiments , e865 and e871 , made use of the tremendous kaon flux available at the ags to push the sensitivity of searches for physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) , in particular , to search for lepton flavor violating decays .",
    "these experiments have , or will soon , reach single event sensitivities of @xmath0@xmath14 and have excluded or severely limited many possible extensions to the sm .",
    "a summary of limits from these searches for bsm physics is provided in table  [ table : bsm ] .",
    "the e871 experiment is finished with all data analysis , but new results on and other modes are expected from e865 in the near future .",
    ".searches for decays not allowed in the standard model [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first signal was observed in the 1995 data sample of the e787 experiment  @xcite .",
    "no new events were seen in the data sample from 199697  @xcite , and with a background of @xmath15 events and a signal of one event a branching ratio of @xmath16 was measured .",
    "that event was in fact in a very clean region of the signal box with a standard model signal to background ratio of 35 .",
    "an analysis of the final e787 data sample from the last run in 1998 has recently been reported  @xcite . with a measured background of @xmath17 , one new event was observed .",
    "the final plot of range vs. energy from the combined e787 199598 data sample for events passing all other cuts is shown in figure  [ fig : pnn ] .",
    "the branching ratio , as determined from these two events is @xmath18 .",
    "this branching ratio is a factor of two higher than expected in the sm and is higher than allowed by the current limit on @xmath9 mixing .",
    "of course , the uncertainty on the br measurement is large due to limited statistics and new data from the e949 experiment are eagerly awaited .",
    "the new event found in the 1998 data sample is in a relatively clean region of the accepted signal region : the sm signal to background ratio for this event is 3.6 .",
    "an event display is shown in figure  [ fig : event ] .    from the 90% cl limits",
    "@xmath19 a limit on the branching ratio of the neutral mode can be derived  @xcite @xmath20 limits on and @xmath21 can be obtained ( these are 1-@xmath22 limits except for @xmath5 which is 90% cl ) , @xmath23    even with the large statistical error , this new measurement of b ( ) provides a non - trivial contribution to global fits of the ckm parameters  @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath21 from this result are shown in figure  [ fig : rho_eta ] .",
    "the constraints from the other golden b modes , and are shown on the same plot .",
    "one can immediately see that the allowed region is tightly constrained to a narrow crescent by and .",
    "new data from the successor to e787 , e949 will make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the ckm parameters .",
    "in addition , e787 has searched for the decay in the pion kinematic region below the ( @xmath24 ) peak  @xcite . this region contains more of the phase space , but is complicated by a significant background from decays with the @xmath25 scattering in the scintillating fiber target and down - shifting its kinematics into the search region .",
    "the data from the 1996 run of e787 has been analyzed ( @xmath020% of the entire e787 data sample ) .",
    "one event was observed in the search region , consistent with the background estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "this implies an upper limit on b ( ) @xmath27 ( 90% c.l . ) , and is consistent with the 2 events observed above the @xmath24 peak and the sm spectrum .",
    "some additional reduction of the background levels in the remaining e787 data may be possible , but the major focus will shift to the new e949 experiment , which has significantly enhanced photon veto capabilities that will further suppress this background .",
    "in addition , the next experiment after e949 , ckm at fnal , will be essentially free of this background since there is no stopping target .",
    "the current high energy physics program at bnl consists of one experiment : e949  a measurement of the branching ratio b ( ) . this is the first of the ags-2000 experiments to be approved and is to be funded by doe for 6000 hours of running beginning in 2002 .",
    "unfortunately , the fy02 run will fall substantially short of the planned running time , so the expectation is that e949 will need to run beyond fy03 .",
    "e949 is an upgraded version of the e787 experiment , planning to capitalize on the full ags beam to collect data at 14 times the rate of the e787 run in 1995 .",
    "the new detector has substantially upgraded photon veto capabilities , enhanced tracking , triggering , monitoring , and daq capability , and will run at a higher ags duty factor and a lower kaon momentum ( with an increased fraction of useful , stopped kaons ) .",
    "it has been designed to reach a sensitivity of at least 5 times beyond e787 and observe of 510 sm events .",
    "the background level for e949 measurement of b ( ) above the @xmath24 peak is reliably projected from e787 data to be @xmath010% of the standard model signal .",
    "e949 should see up to 10 sm events ( or 20 events at the branching ratio measured by e787 ) within the next couple of years .",
    "this is an exciting opportunity to make a significant contribution to quark mixing and cp - violation that should be fully exploited .",
    "a history of the search for is shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .    the next step towards a precision measurement of b ( ) will be the ckm experiment at fnal .",
    "ckm has been given scientific ( stage1 ) approval by fnal and could be running by 2007 .",
    "ckm plans to use a novel technique for : a decay in flight experiment , with redundant kinematic constraints from a reasonably conventional momentum spectrometer and a novel velocity spectrometer based on rich counters .",
    "ckm expects to observe 100 sm signal events in a two year run , using main injector pulses not needed by the tevatron .",
    "ckm will require less than 20% of the flux from the main injector , but will require a slow extracted spill of @xmath01 second .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows a projected measurement of b ( ) from ckm , assuming the current branching ratio .",
    "other hep experiments that are under consideration to run at the ags include additional running for measurement of g-2 of the muon , a search for muon to electron conversion ( meco ) and a search for and measurement of the branching ratio ( k0pi0 ) .",
    "the national science board of the national science foundation ( nsf ) has has approved the construction of the two new large experiments : k0pi0 and meco , as components of the rare symmetry violation proposal ( rsvp ) .",
    "rsvp is planned to be one of the next major research equipment construction projects at the nsf .",
    "the kopio experiment is designed to discover the decay and measure its branching ratio to @xmath020% .",
    "kopio will make use of a time - of - flight technique to measure the momentum of the @xmath28 and will operate at a large targeting angle to improve the @xmath29 resolution and soften the neutron spectrum to reduce @xmath30 hadroproduction .",
    "kopio will have a substantial photon veto system and make the same sort of background measurements as e787 , directly from the data , with two independent tools for attacking the major background , , through both kinematics and photon veto .",
    "k0pi0 expects to observe 50 sm events , with a background of 50% .",
    "this will allow a determination of @xmath5 to 10% .",
    "k0pi0 is expected to start data collection in @xmath02006 .",
    "the next decade will be an exciting time for improved understanding of cp - violation and quark mixing .",
    "it is quite likely that precise measurements of all four `` golden modes '' will be made : at the b - factories , most likely at the tevatron , and at bnl , kek and fnal .",
    "these measurements will allow a precise determination of ckm parameters and provide a critical test of the sm picture of cp - violation .",
