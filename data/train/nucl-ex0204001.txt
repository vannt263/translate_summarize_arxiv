    "bose - einstein correlations of identical charged pions were first observed and used to extract a source size for pion emission in  annihilations  @xcite .",
    "this technique has since been applied to heavy ion collisions ranging in energy from 1.8  at the bevalac  @xcite to @xmath0  gev at rhic  @xcite ( see also recent reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "symmetrization of the two - pion wave function results in an enhancement of the two - particle correlation in a region of low relative momentum , the extent of which is inversely proportional to the size or radius of the emitting source .",
    "the technique is most commonly referred to as hbt , after the similar technique pioneered by hanbury - brown and twiss to measure stellar radii from intensity interferometry with radio waves  @xcite .",
    "the form of the two - pion correlation depends upon the emission function assumed for the pion source . for static source distributions with no final state interactions , such as the fermi statistical model first used by goldhaber  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the correlation function is related to the square of the 3-dimensional fourier transform of the source distribution , @xmath1 , with respect to the pion relative momentum , @xmath2 , @xmath3 for a multi - dimensional , gaussian parameterization of the source , the enhancement in the relative momentum correlation is given by a multi - dimensional gaussian with each gaussian width inversely proportional to the canonically conjugate dimension , or radius .",
    "for dynamic , rapidly expanding sources the radii decrease with increasing transverse mass , , of the pion pair  @xcite , where @xmath4 , and  is the mean transverse momentum of the pion pair .",
    "these -dependent radii correspond to the relative separations of the pions with low relative momentum and are commonly referred to as `` lengths of homogeneity '' .",
    "interest in measuring source sizes in heavy ion collisions comes partly from the expectation that the presence of a qcd phase transition will lead to large source sizes and long lifetimes for particle emission  @xcite .",
    "the absence of such a signal , coupled with the complex and subtle nature of the dependence , has left many puzzled over how best to interpret the available hbt results . however , in heavy ion collisions , there exists additional geometric information from the size of the system , the centrality of the collision , and also the reaction plane .",
    "results on the pion source shape relative to the reaction plane for non - central collisions  @xcite provide one important confirmation that hbt radii are strongly correlated with physical dimensions of the nuclear overlap region .",
    "a previous comparison of hbt sources to nuclear geometry  @xcite also confirmed this correlation , but the compilation included different source parameterizations , online triggers , and experimental acceptances .",
    "we present a study of the dependence of the radii on system size and centrality for the two - pion correlation function from 14.6  si+al , si+au , and 11.6  au+au collisions at the bnl ags measured by the e802 rotating magnetic spectrometer ( henry higgins ) .",
    "the radii are compared to three geometric quantities : the effective nuclear radius for the number of projectile participants , the radius for the total participants , and the transverse distribution of binary collisions calculated with a glauber model .",
    "the data sets of the three systems span a range of seven distinct nuclear geometries .",
    "the  dependence is examined for the high statistics central si+au and au+au systems and compared to measurements of au+au central collisions by the e866 forward spectrometer .",
    "furthermore , the centrality dependence is investigated separately for high and low values of  for all systems .",

    "the si+al / au data were collected in 1991 and 1992 by bnl e859 , and the au+au data were collected in 1992 and 1994 by bnl e866 .",
    "both experiments were extensions of bnl e802 .",
    "this series of experiments ran in the b1 line of the brookhaven ags from 1986 through 1995 .",
    "the complete experimental setups are described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the components essential for this analysis are a target multiplicity array ( tma ) , a zero - degree calorimeter ( zcal )  @xcite , a series of four drift chambers ( t1t4 ) , two trigger chambers ( tr1,tr2 ) , two multi - wire proportional chambers ( trf1,trf2 ) a time of flight wall ( tof ) , beam counters ( bc ) , and a level-2 trigger ( lvl2 ) .",
    "the tma measured total charged particle multiplicity from resistive tube pads configured in a wall and barrel array surrounding the target .",
    "a sum of the discriminated pad signals was used in the level-1 trigger to enhance both central and peripheral data sets .",
    "the tma was present only for the si beam and was removed prior to the au beam commissioning in 1992 .",
    "the zcal consisted of alternating layers of pb and scintillator and was placed 11  m downstream from the target .",
    "it was completely rebuilt and incorporated into the level-1 trigger prior to the start of au beam in 1992 .",
    "for the data sets presented here the rms energy resolution ranged from @xmath5 for the si beam to @xmath6 for the au beam .",
    "beam definitions and @xmath7 for tof were provided by upstream beam counters ( bc ) in anti - coincidence with a series of veto paddles .",
    "the interaction trigger condition was established by a bullseye ( be ) scintillator detector , placed just before the zcal .",
    "for the au  beam , this was replaced by a erenkov radiator .",

    "for this analysis , the magnet was run at 0.4  tesla , for an integrated field of 0.585  t - m .",
    "the trigger chambers , tr1 and tr2 , were located behind t3 and t4 , respectively . for the 1994 running ,",
    "two highly segmented multi - wire chambers , trf1 and trf2 were added behind t1 and t2 , respectively , to improve track reconstruction in the higher multiplicity environment .",
    "resolutions for the trf chambers were approximately 200  @xmath10 m .",
    "the tof was placed about 6  m downstream and particle flight times were measured with an rms resolution of 120  ps .",
    "the level-2 trigger ( lvl2 ) was an integral part of the data taking and was especially important for collecting two - pion events in peripheral collisions .",
    "it consisted of tr1 , tr2 , tof , and a series of lecroy camac modules used for fast readout , hit storage , memory lookup , and logic  @xcite .",
    "the trigger algorithm looped over all tr1-tof hit combinations and matched hits on tr2 for tracks projected from the target .",
    "momentum and @xmath11 for valid combinations were determined through lookup tables based on hit positions and time - of - flight .",
    "one or two independent regions in mass vs. momentum could be specified in any logical combination to form the trigger condition .",
    "all events for which the lvl2 did not produce a veto within 40  @xmath10sec were accepted .",
    "a set of events in which the lvl2 decision was recorded but not used to veto were collected for each lvl2 condition used in the experiment .",
    "all data sets presented here made use of the level-2 trigger , sometimes in combination with a level-1 centrality trigger in the tma or zcal .",
    "lvl2 rejection factors ranged from 310 for au+au central to si+al peripheral events .",
    "trigger inefficiencies were determined to be of order 1% for these data , and were dominated by the wire chamber inefficiencies .",
    "no detectable trigger bias was found for the two - pion data sets .",
    "nine data sets were taken covering seven different system and centrality conditions .",
    "these data sets are summarized in order of increasing system size and centrality in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the online cut column refers to the multiplicity hardware centrality definition for the si beam data and the forward energy definition for the au beam data .",
