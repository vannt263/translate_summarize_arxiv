    "hard scattering processes such as drell - yan ( dy ) , and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) are receiving increased attention again nowadays with the development of effective theories .",
    "there are two important issues for the processes .",
    "one is factorization . in short , factorization is a separation of long and short distance physics .",
    "usually transition amplitudes for some processes are given by a factorized product or a convolution of hard and soft contributions when the factorization holds .",
    "the hard part is involved with the short distance physics which can be perturbatively calculated .",
    "long distance physics is encoded with the soft contribution . in many cases",
    ", it is parametrized by the matrix elements of some operators .",
    "factorization is in general very nontrivial in the full theory @xcite .",
    "but the advent of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite makes it very simple and automatic .",
    "the other is the threshold resummation in the end - point region . by end - point ,",
    "we mean @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the usual momentum fraction .",
    "it has been quite well known that there are sudakov double logarithms @xmath4^n$ ] . in the end - point region",
    ", the large logarithm compensates the small strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the origin of this singularity is the interaction between energetic partons and soft gluons .",
    "the resummation of these logarithms is necessary and also well studied @xcite .",
    "factorization is again a useful tool in this step @xcite .",
    "one merit of factorization is that the factorized soft part is universal for soft emissions . in @xcite ,",
    "soft contributions are given by the vacuum expectation value of wilson loops .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of the soft part is governed by the cusp anomalous dimensions which originate from the cusp angles in the wilson lines . in position space ,",
    "the cusp angles are well defined geometrically .",
    "they are responsible for the cusp divergences that give one logarithm of @xmath5 .",
    "the other log comes from the light - cone divergences of cusp angles which are proportional to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a light - like segment @xcite .",
    "there have been several works for application of scet to dis and dy processes @xcite .",
    "an interesting kinematic point is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hadronic scale .",
    "this so - called  hard - collinear ",
    "scale @xcite appears when soft and collinear particles interact .",
    "the hierarchy @xmath10 ensures the scale separation into hard , hard - collinear , and soft parts . by two - step matching @xcite",
    ", one can establish the low energy effective theory at @xmath11 . here since the intermediate scale @xmath12 is still large , it is integrated out to form the jet functions .    in scet",
    "the factorization is automatic at the operator level .",

    "the sudakov double logs are minimized at @xmath16 for dis and @xmath17 for dy where @xmath18 is the order of moment .    in dis , it is quite natural to define a jet function whose momentum scales as @xmath19 . the forward scattering amplitude of dis is connected with the quark lines and the intermediate line can be shrunken at the second step of matching by integrating out the large off - shellness @xmath20 , which defines unambiguously the jet function @xcite : @xmath21|0\\rangle \\equiv i\\int\\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4}~e^{-ik\\cdot x}j_p(k)\\frac{\\nslash}{2}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the collinear wilson line and @xmath23 is the jet function . on the other hand , in dy there is no final - state hadron at @xmath24 , nor the hard - collinear scale which defines the intermediate theory @xmath25 @xcite .    in this paper , we do not consider the intermediate scale to separate @xmath25 and @xmath26 for dy .",
    "instead , the full qcd is directly matched onto the final effective theory at @xmath27 .",
    "the end - point region is defined by @xmath28 , so the energy of final - state hadron @xmath0 is a small quantity .",
    "this is slightly different from the recent analysis on dy in scet of @xcite , where @xmath29 is a large intermediate scale and two step matching is implemented .",
    "the main calculation of @xcite , which is for the soft gluon exchange diagram , is very similar to the full qcd analysis of @xcite . in this work",
    ", the same diagram is calculated in a more scet - based way .",
    "an alternative for the soft gluon effects is the use of soft wilson lines developed in @xcite . at @xmath30",
    "all the soft gluon effects are contained in the factorized single gluon loop .",
    "it is shown how the new approach gives the same result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section deals with the basic kinematics and viewpoints on the application of scet to dy . in section iii ,",

    "are analyzed in a general form .",
    "they also use the terminology  jet function  but the meaning is slightly different from that in scet . in @xcite ,",
    "the  jet  functions of dy scale as @xmath190 where @xmath18 is the order of moments .",
    "these are the usual parton distribution functions , and correspond to @xmath191 in this work .",
    "the scaling behavior of the  jet  functions is the same as that of the  soft function  , while the hard function scales as @xmath192 . on the other hand , the  jet  function of dis scales as @xmath193 which exactly corresponds to the scet jet function",
    ". the present work does not introduce the scet jet functions in dy since no intermediate energy scale is assumed .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath194 appears only in the soft wilson lines .",
    "note that there is no scaling like @xmath195 in dy in full qcd .",
    "this is because no intermediate scale @xmath19 is assumed .",

    "the bjorken variable @xmath7 scales at the end - point as @xmath198 , where the final state hadron has a large off - shellness , @xmath199 @xcite . in @xcite , a similar relation holds , @xmath200 , but in this case @xmath201 to make the intermediate scale @xmath0 large enough .",

    "consequently , @xmath204 behaves much better than that of @xcite for large @xmath18 , and our scaling behavior is consistent with the literatures .    in summary ,",
    "dy process is analyzed in scet near end - point . with the scaling of @xmath77 , full qcd",
    "is directly matched onto scet at @xmath27 .",
    "previously well known results are successfully reproduced .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the soft wilson line approach ensures that the factorization of soft gluon effects is automatic , and a single gluon loop diagram gives the same soft gluon corrections at @xmath30 .",
    "the structure of rge is rather simple because there is no intermediate scale .",
    "it is also discussed how the scale dependence vanishes in the cross section .",
