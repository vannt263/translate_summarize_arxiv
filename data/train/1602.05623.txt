    "under intense light - matter conditions , relativistic corrections may play a significant role in various systems like dense plasmas @xcite , heavy atoms and molecules @xcite or condensed - matter systems @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of the associated charge and spin dynamics can be in principle investigated using relativistic versions of density functional theory ( dft ) based on the dirac - kohn - sham equations and relativistic mean - field or dirac - hartree - fock models @xcite .",
    "however , these fully relativistic descriptions involve a four - component dirac wave function , where the role played by the electronic spinor is concealed , as well as the physical mechanisms that involve the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "such approaches are therefore not useful to validate or uncover new mechanisms in the physics of condensed matter where only electronic 2-component pauli spinors are considered .",
    "an understanding of ultrafast spin - light interactions is particulary required in the field of femtomagnetism , where the ultrafast demagnetization of ferromagnetic samples induced by femtosecond laser pulses has been studied for almost two decades @xcite without reaching any consensus regarding the physical mechanisms that underly the quick loss of magnetization .",
    "many relevant proposals have been suggested to explain the ultrafast spin dynamics , ranging from spin - flip scattering involving magnons @xcite , electrons @xcite or phonons @xcite , to superdiffusive spin current theory @xcite or angular momentum transfer with light @xcite .",
    "this issue has taken a new turn with an experiment performed on ferromagnetic films @xcite , showing how to eliminate the ultrafast demagnetization associated to thermal effects and therefore how to have access to the coherent magneto - optical response of the spins .",
    "this result indicates that the response of the material induced by a 50-fs laser pulse interacts coherently with the spins to produce a significant magneto - optical effect during the pulse propagation .",
    "according to the authors of @xcite , the observed results may be explained by the relativistic interaction between spins and photons through the foldy - wouthuysen ( fw ) hamiltonian representing the expansion of the dirac hamiltonian at second - order in power of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the major role is played by a spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) involving the electromagnetic field of the laser pulse which goes beyond the usual soc due to the electric field of the ions .    to gain a sound understanding of these coherent effects , a theoretical description requires the modeling of the nonlinear dynamics of a quantum - relativistic system of many interacting electrons excited by an intense and ultrashort electromagnetic field including all the light - matter terms up to second - order in @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , an analytical solution of such many - electron system does not exist , and its numerical solution using _ ab - initio _ methods is beyond the ability of present - day computers . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "one may work within a mean - field theory , where the global effect of the @xmath1-particle interactions are incorporated in an effective field that acts on a one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning that a mean - field derivation including all second - order terms in @xmath0 , is a required step before adding further effects such as exchange and correlations .    to achieve this task , in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we laid the foundations of a two - component self - consistent mean - field model originating from the semi - relativistic limit of the dirac - maxwell equations at second - order in @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown that a self - consistent theory valid up to second - order in @xmath0 requires the semi - relativistic expansion of the charge and current densities acting as sources in the maxwell equations , themselves expressed as a power series in the inverse of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "this model preserves the mathematical structure of the schrdinger or kohn - sham equations @xcite . in a further work we found that the model is able to describe all the electromagnetic interactions occurring in a two - electron system ( as described by the breit - pauli hamiltonian ) , such as the spin - orbit and spin - other - orbit interactions as well as the spin - spin interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model clearly explains how these interactions are created within the single - electron foldy - wouthuysen hamiltonian involving the internal electromagnetic potentials originating from the electronic charge and current densities .",
    "in the present work , we consider the addition of an external electromagnetic field that creates light - induced sources leading to a coherent effective mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "the latter represents the coherent electromagnetic response of the spin - polarized electron gas induced by the external excitation .",
    "it contains precisely four identified mechanisms involving the spin degrees of freedom that can be associated to spin - orbit and spin - other - orbit interactions both induced by the external light pulse .",
    "a dimensionless analysis based on realistic values of light - matter conditions shows that these coherent effects may play a role in the experimental trends observed in @xcite .",
    "the present results can also enlighten the discussion about the mechanisms underlying the origin(s ) of the laser - induced demagnetization .    finally , let us also mention interesting works that have tried to evaluate the contribution of the relativistic effects proposed in @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of light - induced relativistic terms on hydrogen - like atoms @xcite or semi - classical drude - voigt model @xcite shows that these effects may produce a magneto - optical contribution , whereas a more recent _ ab - initio _ investigation on the linear magneto - optical response functions @xcite concluded that their contributions are negligible .",
    "however , each of the above studies was performed within radically different approximations , so that the debate is still open .",
    "we hope that the present work will help focus on the particular spin - light interaction obtained within the dirac - maxwell model , which appears to be relevant for addressing the issue of ultrafast coherent magneto - optics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the semi - relativistic dirac - maxwell system in the presence of an external electromagnetic field leading to the light - induced mean - field model , including the role of the microscopical sources .",
    "we show in section iii that these light - induced effects are not negligible within current light - matter conditions and we perform a detailed analysis of the microscopic mechanisms involving the spins .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "we consider a many - electron system in the presence of an external electromagnetic field ( for instance a laser pulse ) where both quantum and relativistic effects can in principle play a significant role . in a quantum relativistic mean - field approach",
    ", the electron dynamics is governed by the dirac equation ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 where a distinction is made between the _ external _ potentials @xmath5 related to the laser pulse and the _ internal _ potentials @xmath6 created by the presence and the motion of all the electrons .",
    "the dirac wave function is a bi - spinor @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the electron and positron pauli spinors and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dirac s matrix @xcite .",

    "the internal electromagnetic fields are treated in the coulomb gauge ( @xmath19 ) along with the quasi - static approximation @xmath20 . in this framework ,",
    "the maxwell s equations ( [ 3 ] ) have to be modified and , following the procedure detailed in @xcite can be expressed in terms of two poisson - like equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse component of the current density @xmath23 ( by definition @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the longitudinal current density with @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite ) . the analytical solutions of eqs .",

    "this assumption is motivated by the fact that this term introduces fourth - order derivatives in the evolution equation , unlike the non - relativistic schrdinger equation which only contains second - order derivatives .",
    "another important point is that this term is of third - order in @xmath33 which is beyond the purpose of this work .",
    "working within the nonrelativistic pauli limit also requires to take the low - speed limit of the maxwell equation .",
    "we focus first on eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) involving the internal potentials produced by the sources .",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that the charge and current densities can be expanded in powers of @xmath0 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 as @xmath40    in order to build a model treating at the same order the equation of motion ( pauli ) and the field equations ( maxwell ) one should also expand maxwell s equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) to the second - order in powers of @xmath0 by writing the electromagnetic potentials as @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the poisson - like equations ( [ 5 ] ) are related to the above sources given in eqs.([9]-[12 ] ) as follows @xmath43 the second - order current density @xmath44 should be neglected since it would give rise to an internal potential of order @xmath45 .",
    "however , that is not the case for the term @xmath46 which is needed to have a complete description . if some external electromagnetic fields are also present ( e.g. the laser pulse ) these can be assumed to be of zeroth order .",
    "the external potentials of eqs ( [ 2 ] ) can thus be written as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "let us now look at the different terms that make up the current and charge densities .",
    "as for the current density @xmath49 , the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) denotes the orbital charge current , while the last one represents the spin current @xmath50 the middle term in eq.([10 ] ) reads as @xmath51 and is an electronic current induced by any vector potential ( sometimes called the `` paramagnetic current '' ) . in the present work , restricted to order @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 can only be induced by the external vector potential , @xmath48 being of zeroth order .",
    "indeed , the internal vector potential @xmath55 , being of second - order , would induce a second - order current @xmath56 creating a potential that is of fourth order in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , only the vector potential originating from the external electromagnetic field is considered here , and the associated current is marked with the subscript `` field '' meaning `` field - induced '' @xmath57 the above remarks also apply for the second - order density @xmath46 , which can be split into the following three types of terms @xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 originates from the darwin term illustrating a correction to the potential energy due to the so - called _ zitterbewegung _ ( trembling motion of the electron in a volume of size @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the compton wave - length @xcite ) , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 are obtained from the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "thereby , it has to be noted that the light - induced term @xmath63 involves also the spin .    as a consequence , the internal fields involving the light - matter operators in the foldy - wouthusen hamiltonian of eq .",

    "the term @xmath72 is related to the mean internal interactions created by the other electrons of the system , and reads as @xmath79 it has been shown in @xcite that the above potential is equivalent to the breit - pauli interaction in the hartree approximation .",
    "more importantly , it was shown precisely how the the light - matter operators of the single - electron fw hamiltonian couple to the different types of internal fields to recover all the electron - electron interactions involved in a two - body system at second - order in @xmath0 .",
    "here , we just recall that the first term @xmath80 is the usual hartree term while @xmath81 and @xmath82 are mean contact terms . the magnetic dipolar term",
    "@xmath83 illustrates the coupling between the electron momenta .",

    "the last term representing a zeeman effect related to the spin - current of the system @xmath88 logically gives the spin - spin interaction .",

    "hence , it would be relevant to perform a sophisticated and rigorous analysis based on a numerical study , which should be able to give a more precise estimation of @xmath168 .    however",
    ", these effects may play a really important role by employing a larger field amplitude . with an electric field amplitude of @xmath181 v / m , a value that is currently available in laboratories , the value of @xmath168 can easily reach @xmath182 even with @xmath178 m. therefore",
    ", these coherent effects appear to be somehow important , and we thus perform a detailed analysis of the related mechanisms in the following section .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the origin of the quick loss of magnetization following the interaction of a ferromagnetic sample with an ultrafast femtosecond laser pulse is still under active debate .",
    "the demagnetization process occurs within two kinds of physical interactions .",
    "the first is related to the electromagnetic ordering of the system induced by the polarization of the external electromagnetic field , while the second is linked to its internal disorder created by the associated thermal effects . in the last case , the heat filled by the laser generates an increase of the system temperature , and the thermal agitation modifies randomly each spin - orientation leading to a diminution on the average magnetization of the sample .",
    "the coherent magneto - optical signal extracted from the experiment performed in @xcite shows that light - induced coherent effects play an important role in the first few femtoseconds of the demagnetization process .",
    "it is legitimate to ask what are the main physical mechanisms underlying these effects . for that purpose , let us analyze the spin terms of the pauli - like hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) that only involve the external electromagnetic field and the spin degrees of freedom @xmath183 .",
    "one may distinguish @xmath184 where @xmath185 represents the _ direct _ coupling between the spin and the laser through the zeeman interaction and a laser - induced spin - orbit coupling with @xmath186 and @xmath187 stands for the _ indirect _ coupling between the spin and the laser which reads as @xmath188 the operators in eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) illustrate a direct interaction between the laser electromagnetic field and the electron spin .",
    "the latter have already been mentioned in other works and do not constitute the purpose of the present work .",
    "let us now focus on the elements of eq .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) , which can be separated into two types of interactions :    - ( a ) the first two terms exhibit explicitly the pauli spinor @xmath189 and involve a zeeman - like interaction @xmath190 and a soc - like operator @xmath148 .",
    "they represent the mean - charge responses ( characterized by @xmath191 ) acting on the electron spin .",
    "- ( b ) the two others @xmath103 and @xmath104 depict the interaction between the electronic charge @xmath192 and the spin dependent mean - field terms .",
    "they illustrate the mean - spin responses .",
    "let us focus first on the terms of type ( a ) .",
    "( a1 ) the zeeman - like term @xmath100 can be easily understood .",
    "the electron spin interacts with the magnetic field created by the motion of charges induced by the laser field .",
    "indeed , the external vector potential @xmath193 creates an internal current @xmath194 leading to a vector potential @xmath98 which is finally related to a light - induced magnetic field @xmath195 .",
    "this intuitive picture is depicted on the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .        ( a2 ) the spin - orbit mechanism @xmath196 is the usual one involving the electron momentum @xmath197 to which we add the momentum associated to the external vector potential @xmath198 .",
    "the motion of the electronic charge is modified under the action of @xmath199 , as well as its orbital angular momentum with respect to the positions of the other electrons . the effective magnetic field seen by the electron spin",
    "is therefore modified during the action of the pulse and reads @xmath200 ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    ( b1 ) as for the second - type terms acting on the charge , one can see that the operator @xmath104 represents an electromagnetic energy involving two vector potentials : the one of the light @xmath193 and one of the system @xmath201 .",
    "the latter is created by the internal spin current @xmath202 as depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "this interaction can be seen as an energy - term looking like @xmath203 or as a paramagnetic dipolar coupling where @xmath199 substitutes to the electron momentum @xmath197 .",
    "we remember also that the magnetic field @xmath204 generated by @xmath202 that couples to the electron spin via a zeeman interaction corresponds to the internal spin - spin interaction given in @xmath72 .",
    "( b2 ) finally , the last term @xmath103 is the most surprising .",
    "the electronic charge feels a second - order hartree potential that is related to the charge density @xmath205 , this latter quantity being a function of both the spin and laser field .",
    "the two vectors @xmath105 and @xmath31 generate another one @xmath206 which is finally associated to an effective electric field @xmath207 ( see right - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    as a summary ,",
    "the connection between these interactions and the microscopic sources producing the electromagnetic field is depicted in table i. given the order of magnitude of the coherent effects within current light - matter interaction conditions , and following the above analysis , one would suggest that these four mechanisms , may play an important role within the first few femtosecond of the demagnetization process .",

    "in this work , the semi - relativistic limit of the self - consistent dirac - maxwell equations was obtained up to second - order in @xmath0 in the presence of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the result consists on the availability of a self - consistent two - component mean field model that incorporates all the quantum and relativistic effects occurring at order @xmath52 .",
    "the model also leads to a coherent light - induced semi - relativistic hamiltonian that can describe the coherent interaction of an ultrafast laser pulse with a system of @xmath1 interacting electrons in the mean field approximation .",
    "the latter appears to be relevant to current laser - matter conditions .",
    "we have extracted four clearly identified mechanisms that involve the interaction of the external laser pulse with the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "they can be seen as light - induced spin - orbit interaction and light - induced spin - other - orbit interaction .",
    "we hope that the present work will lead to promising numerical investigations in a near future . also , we believe that these results can be helpful to enlighten the issue of the microscopic interactions in the light - induced ultrafast spin dynamics",
    ". however , at this current step , the model presents several limitations that have to be incorporated in future analytical and numerical developments .",
    "firstly , one should be able to produce numerical calculations of the charge and spin dynamics and see how strong the light excitation should be to perturb significantly the equilibrium state fixed by the internal electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the set of obtained equations appears to be a time - dependent self - consistent schrodinger - poisson - like system including magnetic properties .",
    "it thus belongs to a well - know framework which can be in principle numerically solved @xcite .",
    "another goal of such modeling is to establish a hierarchy between the mechanisms that involve the spin degrees of freedom , and to determine which mechanisms are the most relevant ones , depending of course on the initial conditions given by the choice of a physical system .",
    "also , one should go beyond the hartree approximation which neglects the exchange and correlations effects .",
    "the latter playing an important role in ferromagnetic materials , we hope to incorporate them in a future work .",
    "finally , another improvement would be to incorporate a second ( or multiple ) light pulse(s ) to describe efficiently the nonlinear optical effects .",
    "indeed , most experimental techniques that extract information on the ultrafast spin and charge dynamics are based on nonlinear time - resolved pump - probe or four - wave mixing experiments , whose experimental signals exhibit a nonlinear combination of pump and probe beams intensities .",
