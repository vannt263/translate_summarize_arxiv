    "jet - finding techniques , a well - established tool for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions  @xcite , are not directly applicable in heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions due to the overwhelming combinatorial backgrounds from high multiplicity underlying events . for central pb+pb collisions ,",
    "nearly all  400 nucleons participate , leading to a high multiplicity of particles produced in simultaneous nucleon - nucleon collisions . in conventional jet - finding algorithms , this background energy will be swept up into the jet - cone , and strongly distort the reconstructed jet .",
    "this problem is also present , but to a much lesser extent , in p+p collisions at the lhc due to multiple p+p interactions as a result of the planned high luminosity , and due the high probability for multiple - parton interactions within a single p+p interaction .",
    "experience from rhic ( relativistic heavy - ion collider ) has shown that high transverse momentum , @xmath5 , phenomena are promising tools to investigate the hot and dense medium produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the most striking results from the first five years of rhic operation are centered around the observation that hadron production at high @xmath5 is strongly suppressed in central heavy - ion collisions at @xmath6  gev .",
    "hadrons are dominantly produced by the fragmentation of partons from hard scatterings in the initial state .",
    "the suppression of particle production is likely due to energy loss by these partons in the hot and dense matter created in the collision ( possibly a quark gluon plasma )  @xcite . reconstructing the remnants of these hard partons , jets , can serve as a probe of the produced medium .    measurements of parton energy loss at rhic have been limited to leading particle analysis and hadron correlations .",
    "full jet reconstruction and measurement of jet energy has not been possible due to the large and highly fluctuating background of uncorrelated hadrons of the underlying event and the typical low jet energies . however , a striking improvement in jet reconstruction capability is expected in heavy - ion collisions at @xmath7  tev at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) .",
    "an extrapolation of the charged particle rapidity density based on super proton synchrotron ( 17 gev ) and rhic ( 130 and 200 gev ) measurements suggests an additional factor of about 4 increase from rhic top energy to lhc .",
    "the growth of the cross - section for hard processes is , however , much more dramatic .",
    "[ fig : edep_jets ] shows the differential cross - section for inclusive jets within a pseudorapidity range of @xmath8 in @xmath2 collisions at rhic and lhc energies from nlo pqcd as calculated by pythia 6.2  @xcite ( left axis ) and the expected annual yields in minimum bias au+au and pb+pb collisions ( right axis ) . a substantial enhancement in the jet cross - section is already seen at relatively low @xmath5 ( @xmath920 gev ) .",
    "the kinematic reach for jet measurements",
    "is thus much larger at lhc than at rhic , allowing the reconstruction of high energy jets above the uncorrelated background on an event - by - event basis .    theoretical studies of partonic energy loss in a quark - gluon plasma predict that jets with intermediate transverse energies ( 50 gev @xmath10 100 gev ) may provide the best probe of the highly excited nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "partons in this energy range are expected to suffer the greatest relative energy loss and should therefore be more useful for characterizing the properties of the medium than those at asymptotically high energies . moreover ,",
    "intermediate energy jets at lhc are closer to the highest energies probed at rhic , making direct comparisons feasible .",
    "thus , the emphasis of this analysis is on the reconstruction of jets in the transverse energy range from 50 to 100 gev .",
    "differential cross - section for inclusive jets within @xmath8 in @xmath2 collisions at rhic and lhc from default pythia 6.2 ( left axis ) .",
    "the annual yields shown on the right axes are for minimum bias pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions assuming 10@xmath11 s ( 10@xmath12 s ) running time and 0.5 mb@xmath13 s@xmath13 ( 5.0 mb@xmath13 s@xmath13 ) luminosity at lhc ( rhic ) . ]    a first attempt to identify and reconstruct jets on an event - by - event basis in large background pb+pb collisions at the top lhc energy ( 5.5 tev ) is presented in this paper .",
    "a cone - type jet - finding algorithm has been adapted from the ua1 experiment  @xcite and further developed to account for the heavy - ion background .",
    "the choice of various algorithm parameters is discussed and their influence on the jet energy resolution is discussed .",
    "two different methods for determining the large fluctuating background , the most challenging problem for jet - finding , are evaluated .",
    "the presented simulations are based on the alice detector , using charged particle tracking for hadrons and an electromagnetic calorimeter for photon and electron detection .",
    "it has been shown previously that jets can be accurately reconstructed using this combination of detectors in @xmath3 collisions at lep ( large electron positron collider )  @xcite and @xmath14 collisions at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "this paper demonstrates that it can also be successful in the analysis of more complex heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this approach is based on a cone - type algorithm , developed by the ua1 collaboration  @xcite , where the jet is defined as a group of particles in a cone of fixed radius in azimuth- ( @xmath15 ) and pseudorapidity- ( @xmath16 ) space .",
    "the algorithm refinements evaluated by the tevatron run ii jet physics group  @xcite , such as seedless cones , splitting / merging corrections and @xmath17 algorithms  @xcite , are not considered here but their feasibility could also be investigated for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the input to the algorithm is an energy grid in ( @xmath16,@xmath15 ) filled by a combination of transverse energy ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total energy of the calorimeter cell and @xmath20 is the polar angle of the cell ) measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter and charged track transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) information from the tracking system .",
    "the grid covers the same fiducial area as the calorimeter , and each grid cell corresponds in size and position to a calorimeter cell ( @xmath21 in alice  @xcite ) . in order to reduce the contributions from uncorrelated background particles , only charged hadrons with @xmath5 above a threshold @xmath22 were used in the analysis .",
    "neutral energy is measured only in the calorimeter while charged hadronic energy is registered in both the tracking detectors and in the calorimeter . to correct for the double counting of hadronic energy , the estimated energy deposited by charged hadrons in the calorimeter is subtracted on a track - by - track basis using a parameterization of the average simulated energy deposition of charged pions in the calorimeter as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath5 , @xmath23 .",
    "the algorithm consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "initialize the estimated background level per grid cell @xmath24 to the average over all grid cells . 2 .",
    "sort cells in decreasing cell energy , @xmath25 .",
    "3 .   for at least 2 iterations , and until the change in @xmath24 between most recent successive iterations is smaller than a set threshold 1 .   clear the jets list 2 .",
    "flag all cells as outside a jet 3 .",
    "execute the jet - finding loop for each cell , starting with the largest : 1 .",
    "[ jetseed ] if @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a chosen threshold cell energy , and the cell is flagged as not in a jet , treat it as a jet seed candidate : 1 .",
    "set jet centroid ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) to the co - ordinates of the jet seed cell @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "2 .   using all cells within @xmath32 of the initial centroid , calculate the new energy - weighted ( @xmath33 ) centroid .",
    "set the new energy - weighted centroid to be the new initial centroid .",
    "repeat centroid calculation iterations until the centroid does not shift by more than one cell in subsequent iterations .",
    "3 .   store centroid as jet candidate and flag all cells within @xmath34 of centroid as inside a jet .",
    "re - calculate the estimated background energy @xmath24 using the calculation described in section [ sect : bg_est ] .",
    "5 .   for each jet candidate , calculate the energy by summing the energies of the cells in the cone and subtracting the background .",

    "to further separate the effects of the various algorithm cuts and the effect of background fluctuations , we have studied the effects of the algorithm cuts on @xmath2 simulations . for this purpose a cross - section weighted spectrum of pythia jets with pycell transverse energies between 20 and 180 gev was generated .",

    "the spread of the reconstructed energies due to the width of the selected interval was taken out by subtracting the nominal trend of reconstructed energy as a function of input energy .",
    "the resolution for the ideal case ( no cuts ) , but excluding undetectable particles ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 and neutrons ) is approximately 15@xmath44 , independent of energy ( triangle symbols ) .",
    "application of the cuts on charged particle @xmath40 and reducing the cone radius to @xmath45 leads to additional loss of resolution as shown by the diamond and square markers .",
    "using the final heavy - ion optimized parameters ( see table  [ tab : paramfinal ] ) leads to a resolution of approximately 26 - 35@xmath44 for jets with 50 gev  @xmath46  160 gev ( circles ) .",

    "it has been shown that using this algorithm with the alice detectors , jets of 50 gev and higher transverse energies can be reconstructed on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the @xmath2 resolutions are significantly affected by the choice of parameters required to suppress the background in heavy - ion collisions .",
