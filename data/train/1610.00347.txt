    "parallel histories of cosmic star formation ( sf ) and supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion are suggestive of a causal relationship between the two processes , yet the nature of this link remains an open question in astrophysics . at the root of this connection is the cold molecular gas in galaxies , which must be shared as fuel for both growing black holes and building stellar nurseries . far from simple competitors ,",
    "however , the roles of sf and smbh growth in a galaxy s evolution are varied and complex .",
    "( see , e.g. , reviews on the subject by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "molecular , star - forming gas in the circumnuclear region of galaxies known to host accreting smbhs ( called active galactic nuclei , or agn ) are particularly useful test - beds for theories relating the feedback of the smbh on sf ( and vice versa ) given the relatively short distances ( @xmath6 kpc ) between the molecular gas and the smbh .",
    "the @xmath1 cloverleaf quasar and its host galaxy have emerged as a case study for co - occurring sf and smbh accretion during the epoch of peak galaxy assembly . although the cloverleaf was initially discovered in an optical survey of luminous quasars @xcite , follow - up observations @xcite of the sub - millimeter ( submm ) continuum revealed an excess in the rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) portion of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that was consistent in spectral shape with thermal emission from dust .",
    "this fact and the knowledge that the quasar is strongly gravitationally lensed @xcite , combined with the advent of high-@xmath7 co measurements @xcite , rendered the cloverleaf a prime target for co line searches .",
    "the detection of co(@xmath8 ) in the system @xcite effectively launched the cloverleaf into the early stages of its longstanding role as a laboratory for high-@xmath7 studies of molecular gas and sf in the environs of a powerful agn . since the first successful co measurement",
    ", the cloverleaf has been observed , to date , in numerous tracers of molecular gas , including 8 transitions of the co ladder ( @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b09 ) , @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* b09 ) , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( b09 ) ) , two fine - structure ( fs ) transitions of [ ci ] ( @xmath17p@xmath18p@xmath19 @xcite and @xmath17p@xmath20p@xmath21 @xcite ) , hcn ( @xmath22)@xcite , and hco@xmath23 ( @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite ) , and cn @xcite . spatial extent of the molecular gas , derived from a co(@xmath25 ) map , has also been assessed , and appears to be concentrated in a disk of radius 650 pc , centered on the smbh ( * ? ? ? * vs03 ) .",
    "non - lte modeling of co excitation with an escape probability formalism suggests that all observed transitions can be described by a single gas component @xcite , so there is no indication of significant molecular emission in the observed lines beyond the co(@xmath25 ) disk .",
    "physical conditions inferred from the modeling point to @xmath263@xmath27 @xmath5 and @xmath2860  k , suggesting that the co gas is distributed uniformly or with high areal filling factors  not in sparse clumps  in order to maintain this thermal state throughout the @xmath6  kpc - wide emitting region .",
    "in addition to molecular spectroscopy , ( sub)mm continuum measurements have provided further insight into the nature of sf in the cloverleaf ism . in the rest - frame ir",
    "sed compiled by @xcite , the cloverleaf s continuum emission appears double - peaked , with distinct cold and warm gas components with dust temperatures of @xmath29  k and @xmath30  k , respectively . the starburst origin of the cold gas component is strongly supported by the detection of emission features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in the cloverleaf s rest - frame mid - infrared spectrum , which were shown to follow the empirical correlation to fir luminosity established for starbursts and composite quasar / starburst systems in the local universe @xcite .",
    "attributing , then , the entirety of the fir ( 42.5122.5@xmath0 m ) luminosity , @xmath31 , inferred from the cold component of the sed , reveals a starburst of intrinsic @xmath32  l@xmath33 .",
    "the presence of a major starburst suggests that molecular gas in the cloverleaf is heated , at least in part , within the depths of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) illuminated by far - ultraviolet photons from the ongoing star formation .",
    "however , while categorically  ultraluminous , \" the cloverleaf starburst accounts for only 510% of the total bolometric luminosity , @xmath34  l@xmath33 ; the system energetics remain dominated by the central engine . in fact , b09 estimate an x - ray flux toward the edge of the 650 pc radius of @xmath35  erg  s@xmath36  @xmath37 , and find that irradiation by x - rays could play a significant role in gas heating , as well .",
    "they explain the high total co - to - far - ir continuum ratio of @xmath38 , atypical of local starbursts , with a scenario in which x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) contribute substantially to the co emission .    identifying the dominant heating source of the molecular gas in the cloverleaf",
    "is essential to understanding the relationship between the smbh and sf in the host galaxy and , particularly , the role of agn in regulating star - formation . in this paper , we present new measurements of key diagnostic lines of atomic and ionized media to aid in the interpretation of the excitation mechanisms for the observed co in the cloverleaf disk .",
    "the detected lines , namely [ cii]158@xmath0 m , [ oi]63@xmath0 m , [ oiii]52@xmath0 m , and [ siii]35@xmath0 m , provide highly complementary information to the co spectroscopy by tracing star - forming gas in different phases of the ism , and by providing additional means to test xdr and pdr models , which can predict bright emission in the observed atomic lines .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "first , we report in section  [ sec : observations ] the measured line fluxes from _ herschel_-spire and -pacs instruments , and discuss uncertainties where necessary . with observations of the important pdr cooling lines",
    "[ cii]158@xmath0 m and [ oi]63@xmath0 m enabled by _",
    "herschel _ , we are able to infer the average densities and fuv fluxes prevalent in the cloverleaf pdrs by employing traditional fs line ratio diagnostics , as well as to better estimate the relative contribution of the agn and sf to producing the observed emission , which we explore in section  [ sec : analysis ] . there ,",
    "after subtracting contributions from ionized gas in the narrow line region ( nlr ) and hii regions , we compare measured line ratios of the fs lines and co to predicted values from pdr and xdr models and determine their respective contributions to the observed emission .",
    "we also briefly consider shock excitation of co as an alternative explanation for the unusual high total co line - to - fir continuum ratio . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we place our findings for the cloverleaf in the context of other agn discovered at similar and lower redshifts .",
    "measured fluxes for the fine - structure ( fs ) lines obtained in this work are presented in table  [ tab : flux_table ] .",
    "we supplement our measurements with published fluxes for the [ nii]122@xmath0 m emission , co up to @xmath399 , and the 6.2  @xmath0 m and 7.7  @xmath0 m pah emission features .",

    "10214 + 4724 ( @xmath41 ) , and mg  0751 ( @xmath42 ) were also targeted for observations with _ herschel _ spire - fts in the ` ot1_mbradfor_1 ` program .",
    "we present in this appendix the results of a search for [ cii]158@xmath0 m and [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission in these sources .    for fsc  10214 + 4724 ,",
    "we report a @xmath43 upper limit on the apparent [ cii]158@xmath0 m flux as @xmath44  w  m@xmath45 .",
