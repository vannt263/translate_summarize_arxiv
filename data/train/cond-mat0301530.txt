    "emery and kivelson presented [ 1,2 ] very strong physical arguments that in systems with low superfluid density @xmath2 ( e.g. , high - t@xmath3 copper oxide superconductors and the organic superconductors ) the fluctuations in phase of the superconducting order parameter play a significant role . in essence , the superfluid density is proportional to the helicity modulus of a superconductor [ 3 ] , which measures the stiffness of the superconductor with respect to twists in phase of the order parameter ; hence a low value of @xmath2 implies a low value of the maximum possible phase ordering temperature @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is comparable to the measured physical superconducting temperature t@xmath3 , the observed superconducting properties may be very different from what is predicted by the mean - field bcs / eliashberg theory .",
    "they further argued that in the case of poor screening , as indicated by a low conductivity , the coulomb interaction suppresses the local cooper pair density fluctuations @xmath5 , which in turn enhances the phase fluctuations @xmath6 ( @xmath7 1/2 ) .",
    "thus , the phase fluctuations might influence the superconducting properties over a wide range of temperatures below and above t@xmath3 .",
    "indeed , measurements of the @xmath0-plane magnetic field penetration depth @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) on yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 [ 4 ] gave unambiguous evidence for three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy critical scaling behavior in a temperature interval of about 10 k below t@xmath3=92.74 k. roddick and stroud [ 5 ] were the first to point out that classical phase fluctuations in a nodeless order parameter could produce a low - temperature @xmath8 which varies linearly with @xmath13 in an isotropic three - dimensional superconductor .",
    "they also showed that this dependence persists when combined effects associated with coulomb energy of local charge density fluctuations and ohmic dissipation are included in the model .",
    "this important result showed that the observed linear temperature dependence of the @xmath0-plane @xmath14 in ybco at low t [ 6 ] does not necessarily originate from quasiparticle excitations near the lines of the gap nodes at the fermi surface .",
    "the same idea was advanced independently by emery and kivelson [ 1 ] , who also argued that a large @xmath0-plane conductivity in ybco implies that the phase fluctuations are predominantly _ classical _ down to low temperature .",
    "more recently , emery and kivelson [ 7 ] argued that very extensive angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments found no evidence of quasiparticle excitations near the nodes of the gap even just below t@xmath3 , and therefore the existence of nodes is not responsible for the observed linear @xmath13-dependence of the @xmath0-plane @xmath14 in ybco at low temperatures .",
    "+ if , indeed , the phase fluctuations in the order parameter are responsible for the observed linear temperature dependence of the @xmath0-plane superfluid density at low @xmath13 [ 1,5,7 ] , then the experiments [ 8 ] on @xmath1-axis electrodynamics in ybco are puzzling and have to be explained .",
    "namely , it was found that the @xmath1-axis penetration depth @xmath15 never has the linear temperature dependence observed in @xmath0-plane .",
    "the best fit to the data up to about 40 k gives @xmath16 .",
    "if the phase fluctuations are predominantly classical down to low temperature one would expect the superfluid density to be linear at low @xmath13 in _ all _ directions .",
    "indeed , that is exactly what was obtained by roddick and stroud [ 5 ] in a simple model for an anisotropic superconductor using a variational self - consistent phase phonon ( scpp ) approximation . here",
    "we present a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) study of helicity moduli for an anisotropic 3d xy - model which incorporates the bilayer structure of yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath17 . as expected",
    ", we find the helicity moduli to decrease linearly at low temperatures in all directions .",
    "thus the classical anisotropic 3d xy - model can not account for the observed temperature dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth of yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath17 along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss our model and some details of the mc calculation .",
    "section 3 contains our numerical results for the helicity moduli and our conclusions .",

    "the ab - plane josephson couplings with constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the transfer of one and two cooper pairs [ 9 ] , @xmath27 is the josephson coupling constant between two layers within a given bilayer , and @xmath28 is the josephson coupling constant between layers in two adjacent bilayers .",
    "this hamiltonian is obtained from the coarse - grained ginzburg - landau model for ybco [ 10 ] by ignoring the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "the computation of the helicity modulus along direction perpendicular to the bilayers requires care as the separation between the layers in a bilayer , @xmath29 , is , in general , different from the separation between the bilayers , @xmath30 .",
    "if a _ uniform _ vector potential @xmath31 is applied its effect on the hamiltonian is to shift the phase difference between points @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the flux quantum : @xmath36 .",
    "the momentum conjugate to @xmath23 is the charge @xmath37 ( in the units of @xmath38 ) and its rate of change , given by @xmath39 , is the total current flowing into the site @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting expression can be used to define the current along each bond connected to site @xmath40 . in equilibrium",
    "@xmath41 = 0 and one obtains the _ average _ current conservation at each site @xmath40 . for a uniform @xmath31",
    "perpendicular to the layers , the average currents parallel to the bilayers vanish by symmetry and one has @xmath42 where the angular brackets denote the statistical average for the hamiltonian @xmath43 : @xmath44 = @xmath45 , @xmath46 = @xmath47 , @xmath48 = @xmath49 .",

    "the expression on the right hand side of ( 4 ) gives the average current from the latter site into the site @xmath22 of @xmath24 = 1 layer in the adjacent layer @xmath19 + 1 .",
    "since the average currents along bonds parallel to @xmath31 are equal , one can calculate the @xmath50-axis helicity modulus ( the @xmath50-axis is perpendicular to the layers , i.e.  it is along the crystallographic @xmath1-axis ) by computing the derivative of any one of those average currents with respect to @xmath51 at @xmath51 = 0 . for computational purposes using the monte carlo method we evaluate the average helicity modulus over all bonds parallel to @xmath31 @xmath52\\right .",
