    "in 1932 , fermi  @xcite calculated the probability for an atom to be excited from its ground state by the absorption of a photon emitted from a second excited atom at a distance @xmath0 .",
    "fermi showed that the minimum time for such a process to occur was @xmath1 in accordance with einstein causality .",
    "however , his result was obtained by replacing an integral over only positive frequencies by an integral over both positive and negative frequencies  @xcite .",
    "asymmetry between positive and negative frequencies is a feature of the feynman propagator , which describes the propagation of positive - frequency modes forwards in time and negative - frequency modes backwards in time .",
    "because of this , it is non - vanishing for spacelike separations , which makes causality at the level of the particle dynamics hard to quantify .    in this note , we will take seriously the potential role of negative - frequency modes propagating forwards in time by departing from standard quantum field theory and allowing for negative - energy states . as a result",
    ", we will obtain manifestly - causal tree - level source - to - source transition amplitudes , which are in agreement with the usual s - matrix results .",
    "we will also remark on two intriguing features of this construction : specifically , the cancellation of leading ultra - violet ( uv ) divergences and the absence of a zero - point energy .",
    "however , we will note a potentially - serious issue with perturbative unitarity .",
    "even so , as a non - trivial example at loop - level , we will recover the standard result  @xcite for the electroweak oblique corrections of the standard model , which relies on the breakdown of naive perturbation theory as a result of resonance effects .",
    "we consider a real scalar field of mass @xmath2 . with the aim of accommodating both positive- and negative - energy states ,",
    "we introduce two pairs of interaction - picture creation and annihilation operators , satisfying the algebra @xmath3\\ = \\ \\pm\\:2e_{\\mathbf{p}}\\,\\delta^{(3)}_{\\mathbf{p},\\,\\mathbf{q}}\\;,\\\\\\ ] ] with all other commutators vanishing . here , the on - shell energy @xmath4 and we use the shorthand notation @xmath5 for the dirac delta function .",
    "we wish to interpret both @xmath6 and @xmath7 as _ creation _ operators , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 annihilating a vacuum state @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the imposition of the algebra in   requires us to introduce momentum eigenstates with the following orthonormality :    [ states ] @xmath11    clearly , if we were to interpret the states in   as vectors in the standard hilbert space , those of @xmath12 type would , having negative norm , give rise to negative probabilities .",
    "it is for this reason that we have introduced the double bra - ket notation , which we will describe in section  [ sec : double ] .",
    "combining @xmath13 and @xmath12 type contributions , the free lagrangian density is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kronecker delta and the indices @xmath16 run over the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type field operators , given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates the hermitian - conjugate term and the overall minus sign of @xmath19 has been chosen by convention . throughout , we use the shorthand notations @xmath20 the lagrangian in   is chosen to be symmetric under the interchange of @xmath13 and @xmath12 type fields to ensure that the @xmath12 type momentum states are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian , @xmath21 with negative eigenvalues : @xmath22 substituting the field operators from   into   and using the algebra from  , the free hamiltonian may be written in the form @xmath23 we notice that the zero - point contribution has cancelled by virtue of the relative sign between the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type commutation relations in   ( see also  @xcite ) and without having imposed normal ordering . given the democracy imposed between positive- and negative - energy states , we anticipate this cancellation of pure vacuum contributions to be a generic feature .",

    "notice that the commutation relation   is symmetric under interchange of @xmath13 and @xmath12 type field operators in correspondence with the symmetry of the pauli - jordan function under the transformation @xmath29 .",

    "the retarded and advanced propagators are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit step function .",
    "we also define the principal - part propagator : @xmath39 finally , we note the field - particle duality relations    [ fieldpart ] @xmath40    by inspection , we see that the various propagators of the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type field operators are related by the transformation @xmath41 , i.e.  by the interchange of the feynman and dyson pole prescriptions .",
    "we recall that the feynman prescription places the poles of the propagator in the second and fourth quadrants of the complex plane , describing the propagation of positive - frequency modes forwards in time and negative - frequency modes backwards in time .",
    "conversely , the dyson prescription places the poles in the first and third quadrants , describing the propagation of negative - frequency modes forwards in time and positive - frequency modes backwards in time .",
    "thus , this construction is manifestly symmetric under the discrete symmetry transformation @xmath42 .",
    "we note that , using the limit representation @xmath43 of the dirac delta function , the transformation of the wightman propagators under the interchange of @xmath13 and @xmath12 field operators also follows from the transformation @xmath41 .",
    "the retarded , advanced and principal - part propagators , being related to the pauli - jordan function , are symmetric under this transformation .",
    "having imposed democracy between positive- and negative - frequency modes , we now consider a mathematical structure that permits such a construction .",
    "since we have required that the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type operators commute and that the sets of @xmath13 and @xmath12 type momentum eigenstates are each complete , it follows that the @xmath13 and @xmath12 operators must be confined to separate hilbert spaces .",
    "hence , we consider a product space @xmath44 , with the @xmath13 type operators corresponding to the trivial embedding of the usual scalar creation and annihilation operators @xmath45 this construction , although having a very different interpretation , is similar to the doubled hilbert space of thermo field dynamics ( tfd )  @xcite .    in order to accommodate the @xmath12 type states , we supplement the field of complex numbers @xmath46 , having the usual imaginary unit @xmath47 , with an additional imaginary unit @xmath48 . defining the involutions @xmath49 and @xmath50 to be complex conjugation with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath48 , respectively",
    ", we have the following properties :    @xmath52    together with the real unit @xmath53 and the product @xmath54 , we have a four - dimensional basis @xmath55 that spans the ring of bicomplex numbers ( or tessarines ) @xmath56 , forming a commutative and associative algebra over the real numbers @xmath57 , see e.g.  @xcite . given two hypercomplex vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ", we may construct three distinct scalar products : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 , these scalar products correspond to the modulus with respect to @xmath51 , the modulus with respect to @xmath48 and the @xmath56-norm , respectively .",
    "we choose to define the inner product of states @xmath63 with the hermitian conjugate ( @xmath64 ) being the transpose of the complex conjugate with respect to @xmath51 only .- algebra over the field of complex numbers , our operator algebra corresponds to a @xmath65-algebra over the ring of bicomplex numbers , with the antiautomorphic involution provided by the hermitian conjugate with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "it would be of interest to compare this construction with @xmath66-symmetric theories , see e.g.  @xcite , in which a non - positive inner product can be defined with respect to @xmath66 transformations . ]",
    "we may now define the @xmath12 type creation and annihilation operators by the following discrete transformation : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a permutation matrix that reorders the kronecker product and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 akin to the usual time - reversal operator in fock space , but defined instead to be anti - linear with respect to both @xmath51 and @xmath48 , i.e.  for @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we may quickly verify that it is involutory , i.e.  @xmath73^{t_q}=a_{\\mathbf{p}}^{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "choosing the overall sign by convention , the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type field operators are related via @xmath74 we may then show that the free lagrangian in   is anti - symmetric under @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 as we will see , the role of the factors of @xmath48 in this construction is solely to produce systematically the relative signs between @xmath13 and @xmath12 contributions , consistent with the interchange @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce the vacuum state @xmath77 of @xmath78 , satisfying @xmath79 .",
    "we then have the following actions for the creation and annihilation operators : @xmath80 where    @xmath81    consistent with   and  .",
    "finally , the completeness relations of the @xmath13 and @xmath12 fock bases may be written as @xmath82 in which the @xmath83-particle state is @xmath84 .",
    "were we to redefine @xmath85 in the preceding sections , we would immediately recover the algebra of tfd  @xcite , with the transformation @xmath75 corresponding to the operation of `` tilde - conjugation '' . the free hamiltonian in   would then be the liouvillian operator , whose role is to generate time - translations of `` thermal '' states .",
    "instead , we wish to consider interactions that preserve the democracy of the hamiltonian in the @xmath13 and @xmath12 type field operators . for this reason ,",
    "we _ choose _ to consider the following interaction hamiltonian density : @xmath86\\:-\\:j_x\\big[\\phi^+_x\\:+\\:\\phi^-_x\\big]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is a real - valued classical source and @xmath88 is a coupling of mass dimension one .",
    "we have not allowed for terms that directly mix @xmath13 and @xmath12 contributions , since these would potentially lead to an ill - defined perturbation series , containing products of dirac delta functions with identical arguments , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we might be concerned that the interaction hamiltonian density in   is complex - valued with respect to both @xmath51 and @xmath48 . however , by wick s theorem , any non - vanishing contractions of @xmath12 type field operators will be built from the expectation values of bi - linears . since @xmath19 is purely imaginary with respect to @xmath48 , i.e.  @xmath89 , all such correlation functions will contain only even powers of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , all correlation functions and the corresponding matrix elements will be complex - valued with respect to @xmath51 only , giving real - valued and positive - semi - definite probabilities .    since the classical source @xmath87 couples only to the sum @xmath90",
    ", we consider the following change of basis : @xmath91 which resembles the orthogonal rotation to the so - called keldysh ( or physical ) basis of thermal field theory , see section  [ sec : path ] , used in  @xcite to make apparent the causal structure of source - to - sink amplitudes . in this basis , we may write the hamiltonian density in the form @xmath92\\:-\\:j_x\\,{\\widetilde{\\phi}}^+_x\\;,\\ ] ] with the classical source @xmath87 now coupling only to the field @xmath93 . note the factor of @xmath94 for the coupling , which results from the fact that we have not chosen @xmath95 to be canonically normalized .",

    "if we suppose that the canonical ensemble comprises only @xmath13 type states , then only the @xmath13 type time - ordered propagator will obtain a thermal correction , taking the form @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "calculating the tadpole self - energy in the high - temperature limit , @xmath220 , gives @xmath221 in which the non - trivial tree - level renormalization has now conspired to give the correct thermal mass .",
    "here , we have used the renormalization condition @xmath222 , giving @xmath223 and @xmath224 . since the bose - einstein distribution is tempered in the uv , no additional divergences are encountered . however , having broken the democracy of @xmath13 and @xmath12 contributions , the thermal parts of coordinate - space tree - level source - to - source transition amplitudes will not vanish for space - like separations .",

    "now we turn our attention to the loop corrections to the standard model , as embodied in the oblique corrections to the electroweak gauge - boson propagators  @xcite . despite the fact that the strictly one - loop amplitudes of the negative - energy theory are purely real , we will find agreement with the standard model as a result of the breakdown of naive perturbation theory due to resonance effects .",
