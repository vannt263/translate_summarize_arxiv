    "it is well - known that the ( inviscid and conservative ) truncated euler equation admits absolute equilibrium solutions with gaussian statistics , equipartition of kinetic energy among all fourier modes and thus an energy spectrum @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , cichowlas et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the euler equation , with a very large ( several hundreds ) spectral truncation wavenumber @xmath2 , has long - lasting transients which behave just as those of high - reynolds number viscous flow ; in particular they found an approximately @xmath3 inertial range followed by a dissipative range .",
    "how is such a behavior possible ?",
    "it was found that the highest-@xmath4 modes thermalize at first , displaying a @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "progressively the thermalized region extends to lower and lower wavenumbers , eventually covering the whole range of available modes . at intermediate times , when the thermalized regime only extends over the highest wavenumbers , it acts as a thermostat that pumps out the energy of larger - scale modes .",
    "note that similar @xmath3/ @xmath5 spectra have already been discussed in the wave turbulence literature ( _ e.g._,@xcite ) and were more recently obtained , within a simple differential closure , in connection with the leith model of hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to build a quantitative two - fluid model for the relaxation of the @xmath6 euler equation . in section [ sec :",
    "relaxation ] , after a brief recall of basic definitions , the statistics of the thermalized small scales are studied during relaxation .",
    "they are shown to be quasi - normal . our new two - fluid model , involving both an effective viscosity and a thermal diffusion ,",
    "is introduced in section [ sec : two - fluid ] .",
    "the effective diffusion laws are then determined , using an edqnm closure prediction and direct monte - carlo computations .",
    "the model is then validated by comparing its predictions with the behavior of the original truncated euler equation .",
    "finally section [ sec : conc ] is our conclusion .",
    "the truncated euler equations ( [ eq_discrt ] ) are classically obtained @xcite by performing a galerkin truncation ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 ) on the fourier transform @xmath9 of a spatially periodic velocity field obeying the ( unit density ) three - dimensional incompressible euler equations , @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "this procedure yields the following finite system of ordinary differentials equations for the complex variables @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is a 3 d vector of relative integers @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 and the convolution in ( [ eq_discrt ] ) is truncated to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
