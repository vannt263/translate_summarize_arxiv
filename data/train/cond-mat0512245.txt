    "the history of the investigations of half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf ) starts from the electronic structure calculation for nimnsb @xcite ; later a number of other examples were discovered , e.g. , cro@xmath0 , fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , a number of the heusler alloys co@xmath0mnz and rmnsb ( for a review , see refs . ) .",
    "these substances have metallic electronic structure for one spin projection ( majority- or minority - spin states ) , but for the opposite spin direction the fermi level lies in the energy gap . owing to this fact hmf",
    "attract now a growing attention of researchers in connection with `` spintronics '' , or spin - dependent electronics @xcite .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down contributions to electronic transport properties have different orders of magnitude , which can result in a huge magnetoresistance for heterostructures containing hmf @xcite .",
    "some evidences of the hmf behavior in colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials like la@xmath3sr@xmath4mno@xmath1 found by using tunneling spectroscopy @xcite and photoemission technique @xcite have increased considerably the interest in the half - metallic ferromagnetism ; however , the situation in the cmr systems is controversial , as demonstrate andreev reflection experiments @xcite .",
    "peculiar band structure of hmf results in an important role of incoherent ( non - quasiparticle , nqp ) states which occur because of correlation effects @xcite .",
    "the appearance of nqp states in the energy gap near the fermi level @xcite is one of the most interesting correlation effects typical for hmf .",
    "the origin of these states is connected with `` spin - polaron '' processes : the spin - down low - energy electron excitations , which are forbidden for hmf in the one - particle picture , turn out to be possible as superpositions of spin - up electron excitations and virtual magnons .",
    "the density of these states vanishes at the fermi level @xmath5 for temperature @xmath6 , but increases drastically at the energy scale of the order of a characteristic magnon frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of nqp states is relevant for spin - polarized electron spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite , core - level spectra of the hmf @xcite , and subgap transport in ferromagnet - superconductor junctions ( andreev reflection ) @xcite .",
    "several experiments could be performed in order to clarify the impact of the nqp states on spintronics . in particular ,",
    "@xmath8 characteristics of half - metallic tunnel junctions for the case of antiparallel spins are completely determined by nqp states @xcite .",
    "recently the density of nqp states has been calculated from first principles for a prototype hmf , nimnsb @xcite , and for cras @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "hmf are very interesting conceptually as a class of materials which may be convenient to treat many - body solid state physics that is essentially beyond band theory .",
    "it is accepted that usually many - body effects lead only to renormalization of the quasiparticle parameters in the sense of landau s fermi liquid ( fl ) theory , the electronic _ liquid _ being _ qualitatively _ similar to the electron _ gas _ ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "nqp states in hmf are not described by the fl theory . as an example of highly unusual properties of the nqp states ,",
    "we note that they can contribute to the @xmath9-linear term in the electron heat capacity @xcite , despite their density at @xmath5 is zero for @xmath6 .",
    "spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite is a very efficient new method which enables one to probe directly the spectral density with spin resolution in magnetic systems .",
    "the spin - polarized stm should be able to probe the nqp states via their contribution to the differential tunneling conductivity @xmath10 . at zero temperature ,",
    "nqp states arise only above @xmath5 for the case of minority - spin gap and only below @xmath5 for the majority - gap hmf @xcite .",
    "unlike the photoemission spectroscopy which probes only occupied electron states , stm detects the states both above and below @xmath5 , depending on the sign of bias .",
    "theoretical investigation of nqp contributions to stm spectra is the aim of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we discuss a general expression for the tunneling current @xmath11 as applied to hmf . in sect.3",
    "the effect of surface potential and other spatial inhomogeneities on the nqp spectral density is considered . in sects.4 and 5",
    "we calculate the energy and temperature dependences of @xmath10 and treat the problem of tunneling - current spin - polarization at finite temperatures . in sect.6 the bias dependences of the tunneling conductance are discussed .",
    "a general expression for the tunneling current in the lowest order in the tunneling matrix elements has the form",

    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the expression ( [ curr ] ) takes into account correlation effects in a formally exact way , assuming that the tunneling probability is small .",

    "this condition means that the tunneling probability has a sharp ( at not too small @xmath27 ) maximum for the states with velocity direction normal to the surface . for a generic multi - sheet fermi surfaces the condition of the dominant tunneling",
    "is , generally speaking , more complicated , but this modifies only some weakly bias - dependent factors .",
    "since stm probes only surface one has to discuss first modification of nqp states in comparison with the case of ideal bulk crystal .",
    "the existence of nqp states at the surface of hmf has been demonstrated for a narrow - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "here we present a general derivation valid in the case of arbitrary inhomogeneity .    to describe the effects of electron - magnon interaction for the inhomogeneous case we use the formalism of the exact eigenfunctions developed earlier for the impurity - state problem in a ferromagnetic semiconductor @xcite .",

    "the nqp density of states has a jump at the fermi level .",
    "however , the magnon frequencies can be restored in the final result , in analogy with the case of ideal crystal , which leads to a smearing of the jump on the energy scale of a characteristic magnon energy @xmath87 .",
    "it should be mentioned once more that we restrict ourselves to the case of the usual three - dimensional magnon spectrum and do not consider the influence of surface states on the spin - wave subsystem .",

    ", the density of empty states is measured by the number of electrons with a given spin projection which one can add to the system .",
    "it is obvious that one can not put any spin - up electrons in the spin - up site at @xmath95 therefore the density of nqp states should vanish above @xmath5 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that in the most of known hmf the gap exists for minority - spin states @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the case @xmath88 , so that the nqp states should arise above the fermi energy . for exceptional cases with the majority - spin gap such as a double perovskite sr@xmath100femoo@xmath101",
    "@xcite one should expect formation of the nqp states below the fermi energy .",
    "it has been proven in the previous section that the presence of space inhomogeneity ( e.g. , surface ) does not change qualitatively the spectral density picture , except smooth matrix elements . therefore further in this section",

    "one can prove that , actually , this expression holds for arbitrary @xmath105 at least , in the framework of @xmath106 expansion .",
    "the @xmath107-dependence of the magnon contribution to the residue of the green s function , i.e. of the effective electron mass in the lower spin subband , and an increase with temperature of the incoherent tail from the upper spin subband result in a strong temperature dependence of partial densities of states @xmath108 , the corrections being of opposite sign .",
    "at the same time , the temperature shift of the band edge for the quasiparticle states is proportional to @xmath109 rather than to magnetization @xcite .",

    "the picture of @xmath111 in hmf ( or degenerate ferromagnetic semiconductor ) demonstrates strong energy dependence near the fermi level ( figs .",
    "if we neglect magnon frequencies in the denominators of eq.([dos1 ] ) , the partial density of incoherent states should occur by a jump above or below the fermi energy @xmath89 for @xmath88 and @xmath90 respectively owing to the fermi distribution functions .",

    "this expression is valid only in the framework of the @xmath106-expansion , and in the narrow - band quantum case we have to use more exact expressions ( [ nb22]),([nb2 ] ) . in numerical calculations , we follow to ref . and smear the resolvents , @xmath123 we use the semielliptic magnon dos @xmath124 which is proportional ( with the corresponding shift ) to the bare electron dos , the maximum magnon frequency being determined by the electron concentration @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "this approximation provides the correct behavior near the fermi level ( cf . ref . ) , although gives an unphysical shift of the band bottom by the maximum magnon frequency .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in figs.3 , 4 .",
    "one can see that in the model with @xmath126 ( for @xmath127 this is equivalent to the hubbard model with the replacement @xmath128 , see refs . )",
    "the  kondo \" peaks @xcite modify considerably the picture .",
    "note that the function @xmath129 , which yields dos in the lowest - order approximation in the electron concentration , does not have such peaks .    to investigate details of the energy dependence of @xmath130 in the broad - band case",
    "we assume the simplest isotropic approximation for the majority - spin electrons , @xmath131 provided that we use the rigid splitting approximation @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , the half - metallic situation ( or , more precisely , the situation of degenerate ferromagnetic semiconductor ) takes place for @xmath134 .",
    "then qualitatively the equation ( [ alpha1 ] ) works to accuracy of a prefactor .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , formally speaking , the nqp contribution to dos occurs also for an  usual \" metal where @xmath135 . in the case of small @xmath136",
    "there is a crossover energy ( or temperature ) scale @xmath137 which is the magnon energy at the boundary of stoner continuum , @xmath138 at @xmath139 the equation ( [ dos1 ] ) for the nqp contribution reads @xmath140 \\theta ( e - e_{f } ) .",
    "\\label{dos111}\\ ] ] at @xmath141 this gives the same results as above .",
    "however , at @xmath142 @xmath143 this contribution is proportional to @xmath144 and is _ negative _ ( of course , the total dos is always positive ) .",
    "this demonstrates that one should be very careful when discussing the nqp states for the systems which are not half - metallic .",
    "the model of rigid spin splitting used above is in fact not applicable for the real hmf where the gap has a hybridization origin @xcite .",
    "the simplest model for hmf is as follows : a `` normal '' metallic spectrum for majority electrons ( [ dosbareup ] ) and the hybridization gap for minority ones , @xmath145 here we assume for simplicity that the fermi energy lies exactly in the middle of the hybridization gap ( otherwise one needs to shift @xmath146 in the last equation , @xmath147 being the middle of the gap ) .",

    "the behavior @xmath166 is qualitatively confirmed by experimental data on field emission from ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite and transport properties of half - metallic heusler alloys @xcite .    an attempt was used @xcite to generalize the result ( [ polar1 ] ) on the hmf case ( in fact , using qualitative arguments which are valid only in the atomic limit , see eq.([atom ] ) ) .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that the situation for hmf is more complicated .",
    "in this section we focus on the magnon contribution to dos ( [ dos1 ] ) and calculate the function @xmath167 using the parabolic electron spectrum @xmath168 and averaging over the angles of the vector @xmath151 we obtain @xmath169 where @xmath170 we have used the condition @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the spin splitting@xmath173 in the ferromagnetic semiconductor we have , in agreement with the qualitative considerations presented above : @xmath174    further on we consider the spectrum model ( [ dosbareup ] ) , ( [ dosbaredn ] ) where the gap has a hybridization origin . at @xmath175 we reproduce the result ( [ phi3 ] ) which is actually universal for this temperature region .  at @xmath142",
    "@xmath176 we derive @xmath177 this result distinguishes hmf like the heusler alloys from ferromagnetic semiconductors and narrow - band saturated ferromagnets . in the narrow - band case",
    "the spin polarization follows the magnetization up to the curie temperature @xmath178 .    for finite temperatures",
    "the density of nqp states at the fermi energy is proportional to @xcite @xmath179 generally , for temperatures which are comparable with the curie temperature @xmath178 there are no essential difference between half - metallic and `` ordinary '' ferromagnets since the gap is filled .",
    "the corresponding symmetry analysis is performed in ref . for a model of conduction electrons interacting with `` pseudospin '' excitations in ferroelectric semiconductors .",
    "the symmetrical ( with respect to @xmath89 ) part of @xmath111 in the gap can be attributed to smearing of electron states by electron - magnon scattering ; the asymmetrical (  kondo - like \" ) one is the density of nqp states owing to the fermi distribution function .",
    "note that this filling of the gap is very important for possible applications of hmf in spintronics : they really have some advantages only provided that @xmath180 . since a single - particle stoner - like theory leads to much less restrictive ( but unfortunately completely wrong ) inequality @xmath181 the many - body treatment of the spin - polarization problem ( inclusion of collective spin - wave excitations ) is required .",
    "now we consider an application of the results obtained above to the tunneling spectroscopy problem . the formulas of sect.4 for the energy dependence of nqp contributions are , strictly speaking , derived for the usual one - electron density of states at @xmath5 , which is observed , say , in photoemission measurements .",
    "however , the factor of @xmath182 , which is present in the expression for the tunneling current ( [ tok ] ) , does not influence the temperature dependence , and therefore these results are valid for spin polarization from tunneling conductance at zero bias in stm .",
    "the only difference in the nqp contributions to @xmath183 and @xmath103 is in that after summation over the magnon wavevector @xmath184 the integration is performed over not in the the whole fermi surface , but its two points ( see eq.([rho ] ) ) . for a spherical fermi surface for majority electrons",
    "the results differ by the constant factor of the fermi surface diameter",
    ". however , the energy and temperature dependences should be the same in a more general case .",
    "consider the bias dependence of the tunneling current for zero temperature .",
    "one can see from eq.([tok ] ) that @xmath185 again , the last proportionality can be strictly justified in the case of a spherical fermi surface only , but is qualitatively valid for arbitrary electron spectrum .",
    "one should keep in mind that sometimes the surface of hmf is not half - metallic ; in particular , this is the case of a prototype hmf , nimnsb @xcite . in such a situation ,",
    "the tunneling current for minority electrons is due to the surface states only .",
    "however , the nqp states can be still visible in the tunneling current via the hybridization of the bulk states with the surface one .",
    "the hybridization lead to the fano antiresonance picture which is usually observed in stm investigations of the kondo effect at metallic surfaces ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . in these cases",
    "the tunneling conductance will be proportional to a mixture of @xmath186 and @xmath187 , @xmath188 being the real part of the on - site green s function , @xmath189 ( @xmath190 stands for principal value , @xmath191 is referred to the fermi energy ) .",
    "surprisingly , in this case the effect of nqp states on the tunneling current can be even more pronounced in comparison with the ideal crystal .",
    "the reason is that the analytical continuation of the jump in @xmath103 is logarithm ; both singularities are cut at the energy @xmath192 nevertheless , the energy dependence of @xmath188 can be pronounced , see fig.6 .",
    "this is similar to the effect of enhancement of the nqp contribution to the x - ray absorption and emission spectra , which was predicted in ref . .",
    "now we discuss in more detail the energy dependence for @xmath193 .",
    "the analytical continuation of the @xmath194-contribution to @xmath103 yields the contribution @xmath195 in @xmath188 which is non - zero on the other side with respect to @xmath5 ( a situation that is formally similar to the electronic topological transition , see ref . ) .",

    "stm measurements of electron dos give also an opportunity to probe _ bosonic _ excitations interacting with the conduction electrons .",
    "due to electron - phonon coupling , the derivative @xmath198 and thus @xmath199 at @xmath200 have peaks at the energies @xmath201 corresponding to the peaks in the phonon dos . according to our results ( see , e.g. , eq.([dos1 ] )",
    ", the same effect should be observable for the case of electron - magnon interaction .",
    "however , in the latter case these peaks are essentially asymmetric with respect to the fermi energy ( zero bias ) due to asymmetry of the non - quasiparticle contributions .",
    "this asymmetry can be used to distinguish phonon and magnon peaks .",
    "in the present paper we have demonstrated that non - quasiparticle states in half - metallic ferromangnets exist not only for an ideal crystal , but also in the presence of an arbitrary external potential . in particular , they occur at the surface of the half - metallic ferromagnets . these states can be probed by the stm both directly and via their effect on the surface states ( the fano antiresonance case ) .",
    "therefore , they can be observable even for the situation of surface `` dead layers '' where the surface is not half - metallic .",
    "the expressions obtained can be used for realistic electronic structure calculations of nqp contributions to the electron energy spectrum of the surfaces of hmf .",
    "temperature dependence of the spin polarization at the fermi energy which can be also probed by the stm follows the temperature dependence of magnetization an very low temperatures . for the hmf with a hybridization gap",
    ", there is a crossover energy ( temperature ) @xmath202 where the character of the temperature dependence is changed .",
    "the energy dependence of the nqp contributions ( and consequently the bias dependence of the tunneling current ) is strongly influenced by the band structure too .",
    "in particular , for hmf with a hybridization gap this demonstrates a linear rather than @xmath203 behavior in a wide interval . in the narrow - band case a kondo - like peak ( fig.4 ) near the fermi level should be observed in tunneling experiments .",
    "due to asymmetry of nqp states with respect to the fermi energy , the magnon peaks in @xmath204 are also asymmetric with respect to the zero bias , in contrast with the phonon ones .",
    "this gives an opportunity to distinguish between phonon and magnon peaks in the inelastic spectroscopy by stm .",
