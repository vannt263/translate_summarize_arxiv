    "a number of nearby galaxies are known to host luminous x - ray sources with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath16 ergs s@xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are usually referred to as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ulxs are found to be less common in the local universe , as no persistent ulx is yet identified in our galaxy and m31 . in spite of significant efforts in more than three decade since their discovery",
    ", we have not yet arrived at the general conclusion on their nature .",
    "it is widely believed from their observational features ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the ulx phenomena are related to accreting black holes . because the luminosity of an accreting black hole is though to increase as a function of the black hole mass @xmath17 and accretion rate @xmath18 on the simplest assumption , two distinct ideas are currently proposed to interpret the high x - ray luminosity of the ulxs .",
    "the first option supposes that the luminosity of the ulxs should not exceed the eddington luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , as most galactic black hole binaries meet this criterion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result , the ulxs are required to harbor an intermediate - mass black holes with a mass of @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the solar mass . in the second alternative ,",
    "a super eddington luminosity is permitted .",
    "consequently , the ulxs are regarded as a stellar - mass black hole ( @xmath22 ) , accreting at a super - critical mass accretion rate ( @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the speed of light ) .",
    "it is of vital importance to construct a reliable technique to gauge the mass and/or mass accretion rate of the ulxs , in order to distinguish these two conflicting interpretations . for the purpose ,",
    "the dynamical mass determination is thought to provide inevitably the most stringent constraint , as is the case of the galactic black hole binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the dynamical mass of the ulxs has remained yet to be explored .",
    "x - ray spectra and their variability have been one of the most valuable tools to probe the properties of the ulxs . a naive inspection on the x - ray spectra in the @xmath25 ",
    "@xmath3 kev range categorizes the ulxs into two types ; those with an x - ray spectrum dominated by emission from accretion disk which is approximated by the multi - color disk ( mcd ; @xcite ) model , and those exhibiting a power - law ( pl ) like x - ray spectrum .",
    "in addition , a growing number of ulxs are reported to make a spectral transition between the mcd - like and pl - like states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these spectral behaviors apparently resemble those of galactic black hole binaries in the classical high / soft and low / hard states .",
    "however , several observational obstacles are known for this assumption as follows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the mcd - like ulxs requires a flatter radial temperature distribution within the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) in comparison with that in the standard accretion disk @xcite which is adopted in the mcd model .",
    "the innermost disk radius @xmath26 of the mcd - like ulx appears to be variable as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the innermost disk temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the galactic black hole binaries in the high / soft state are reported to follow a constancy of @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xcite ) which indicates that @xmath26 corresponds to the last stable circular orbit of the accretion disk .",
    "the photon index of the pl - like ulxs ( @xmath29 ; e.g. , @xcite ) tends to be larger than those of the galactic black hole binaries in the low / hard state ( @xmath30 ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent progresses in observational ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical ( e.g. , @xcite ) studies on galactic black hole binaries and their accretion disk , especially near the highest end of their x - ray luminosity , newly identified two spectral states called the very high and slim disk ones , in addition to the classical low / hard and high / soft states . in the very high state , the galactic black hole binaries are reported to exhibit a steep pl spectrum with a photon index of @xmath31 , which is softer than the pl component observed in the high / soft state ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .",
    "the steep pl spectrum in this situation is ascribed to comptonization of the disk photons within the hot corona surrounding the accretion disk .",
    "in contrast , when the galactic black hole binaries become brighter than in the very high state , they are reported to enter the slim disk state in which a disk dominant x - ray spectrum with a flat disk temperature gradient was observed , in addition to an apparent anti - correlation between the innermost disk radius and temperature @xcite .",
    "these properties are successfully explained by the theory of a slim accretion disk , where an optically - thick advection and photon trapping @xcite effectively work due to a high accretion rate ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "triggered by these findings , it is proposed that the mcd - like and pl - like ulxs reside in the slim disk and very high states , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this idea is systematically proved to be convincing , we will have acquired an empirical method to restrict the black hole mass of the ulxs .",
    "this is because the x - ray luminosity of the galactic black hole binaries in these states are reported typically as @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in other word",
    ", this interpretation consequently indicates that the ulxs are shining at a sub- or trans - eddington luminosity .",
    "independently , based on numerical simulation , @xcite extended to the slim accretion disk the mass estimation from the innermost disk radius , which is widely accepted for galactic black hole binaries in the high / soft state accompanied with the standard accretion disk .",
    "it is important to confirm observationally the consistency between these techniques .",
    "recently , it is verified that suzaku @xcite is very useful to investigate the x - ray spectral properties of the ulxs @xcite .",
    "these results motivated us to perform a suzaku observation of the nearest ulx , m33 x-8 @xcite , in which its x - ray spectrum was obtained with the highest signal statistics in the @xmath2  @xmath3 kev range . in the present paper",
    ", we utilized extensively the the suzaku data of the source to investigate the nature of the ulxs .",
    "within @xmath37 arcmin from the center of the nearby normal galaxy , m33 , more than 10 bright x - ray sources were discovered with the einstein observatory @xcite . among these sources ,",
    "x-8 located near the center of the galaxy is known to show the ulx characteristics @xcite . thanks to it proximity at a distance of 795 kpc @xcite , it extensively studied with the previous and active instruments including asca @xcite , bepposax @xcite , chandra @xcite , and xmm - newton ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical x - ray luminosity of m33 x-8 , @xmath38 ergs s@xmath8 , is at the lowest end of those of ulxs ; only the galactic microquasar , grs 1915 + 105 , is confirmed to reach occasionally such a high x - ray luminosity value ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some authors claimed a flat disk temperature distribution to suggest the slim disk interpretation for the source @xcite , although several conflicting ideas were proposed @xcite .",
    "these make m33 x-8 one of the most important object to disentangle the nature of the ulxs by connecting the properties of the ulxs with those of the galactic black hole binaries .",
    "the suzaku observation of m33 x-8 was performed on 2010 january 11  13 . the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite )",
    "was operated in the normal clocking mode with no window option and in the normal mode , respectively .",
    "the source was placed at the hxd nominal position of the x - ray telescope @xcite above the xis .",
    "unfortunately , due to a significant increase in the thermal noise of the hxd pin , the hxd effective exposure was found to reduce to only about 6.1 ks .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the xis data in the present paper .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the standard software package headas 6.10 .",
    "we reprocessed the xis data with the headas tool aepipeline , by referring to the calibration database ( caldb ) as of 2011 february 10 . in accordance with the standard manner",
    ", the following filtering criteria were adopted ; the spacecraft is outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the time after an exit from the saa is larger than 436 s , the geometric cut - off rigidity is higher than @xmath39 gv , the source elevation above the rim of bright and night earth is higher than @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , and the xis data are free from telemetry saturation . as a result",
    ", we derived 91.0 ks of good exposure .",
    "the xis events with a grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 were picked up for the scientific analysis below .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] displays the 0.5  10 kev xis image of m33 x-8 , which is superposed on the optical image of the host galaxy taken from the digitized sky survey @xcite .",
    "the brightest x - ray source in the image , detected at the center of the host galaxy , corresponds m33 x-8 .",
    "a systematic offset of @xmath42 was noticed in the xis coordinate determination , while it is found to be within the current systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we thus re - calibrated the xis coordinate by ourselves , referring to the rosat position of m33 x-8 itself ( ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) = ( , ) ; @xcite ) . within the xis field of view",
    ", another x - ray source m33 x-7 , a candidate of a massive spinning black hole with a mass of @xmath45 @xcite , is clearly seen at a position consistent with the rosat one ( ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) = ( , ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the insufficient signal statistics from the xis , we regard its x - ray spectral properties as irrelevant to the scope of the present paper .    in the scientific analysis below ,",
    "the xis signals from m33 x-8 were accumulated within a solid circle in figure [ fig : image ] with a @xmath46 radius centered on the source , while the background level was evaluated from a source free region with the same radius , denoted by the dashed circle in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "although there is a faint rosat x - ray source , m33 x-15 , near the edge of the source integration region , we estimated its contamination as negligible in comparison with the x - ray flux from m33 x-8 ( less than @xmath47% ) , based on the rosat result @xcite .",

    "we also considered a comptonizing corona surrounding an accretion disk around a spinning black hole by a sum of the bhspec and thcomp components ( bhspec+thcomp ) . because the bhspec model is not written in terms of the disk temperature , it is unable to constrain the seed photon temperature , @xmath127 , of the thcomp component to be consistent with the peak of the bhspec spectrum , through the bhspec+thcomp fitting procedure alone . actually , although a statistically reasonable fit was derived by the bhspec+thcomp model with @xmath127 left free ( see table [ table : bhspec ] ) , this model got settled to a physically unacceptable situation where the spectral peak of the bhspec component ( @xmath129 kev ) highly surpasses the seed photon temperature ( @xmath160 kev ) .",

    "however , we regard that this interpretation encounters several difficulties .",
    "the first obstacle for the very - high - state scenario comes from the high disk temperature of m33 x-8 , which significantly exceeds that of galactic black - hole binaries in the strongly comptonized very high state ( @xmath189 kev ) , termed intermediate hard state . in the case of the galactic black - hole binaries ,",
    "such a low disk temperature in the very high state is explained by a possible disk truncation at a radius significantly larger than the last stable circular orbit @xcite .",
    "secondly , the pl dominance at energies below the disk temperature @xmath28 seems quite unphysical .",
    "the pl component in the very high state is naturally predicted to exhibit a sharp low - energy cut - off below the seed photon energy , because it is basically attributed to comptonization of disk photons within the hot corona , surrounding the black hole and accretion disk .",
    "we tried to reconcile these inconsistencies , by replacing the pl component with the comptonization continuum described by the thcomp mode , where the mcd emission was assumed to provide the seed photon source .",
    "the mcd+thcomp model has eventually arrived at a different solution that the disk photons are comptonized by a low - temperature ( @xmath157 kev ) optically - thick ( @xmath159 ) material , which is clearly deviating from the very high state ( @xmath190 kev and @xmath191 ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations anticipate that extremely high radiation pressure at a highly super - eddington mass accretion rate ( @xmath23 ) induces a strong outflow from the disk @xcite , which serves a cool ( @xmath192 kev ) optically thick ( @xmath193 ) comptonizing corona @xcite .",
    "such a spectral features are gradually suggested from several high - luminosity ulxs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite applied a similar idea to the spectral variation of m33 x-8 .",
    "however , the high - quality xis spectrum from the source requires the absorption column density for the mcd+thcomp model ( @xmath194 @xmath62 ) to be lower than the galactic value ( @xmath136 @xmath62 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we regard such a situation invalid , considering the absorption within the m33 galaxy and intrinsic to the source .",
    "therefore , we have concluded that the comptonization is not a realistic scenario for m33 x-8 .      from observational ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical ( e.g. , @xcite ) studies of galactic black hole binaries and their accretion disk in the decade ,",
    "the extended mcd model is recognized as a good approximation to the x - ray spectrum from a slim accretion disk , which is thought to be realized at a high x - ray luminosity .",
    "actually , the model was successfully utilized to interpret the x - ray spectra of galactic black hole binaries , at the highest end of its x - ray luminosity or in the sub-/trans - eddington regime , as the slim disk state ( e.g. , xte j1550 - 564 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these were subsequently followed by successful applications to the x - ray spectral properties of several ulxs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrated that the xis spectrum of m33 x-8 was successfully described by the extended mcd model .",
    "the innermost disk temperature and radial temperature gradient , @xmath6 kev and @xmath10 respectively , were both found to agree fairly with those previously inferred from the object ( @xmath195  @xmath196 kev and @xmath197  @xmath198 ; @xcite ) .",
    "especially , the flat radial temperature distribution within the disk agrees with the prediction from the slim - disk theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the slim - disk picture seems convincing for the source .",
    "different from galactic black hole binaries in the classical high / soft state , which have been observationally recognized to harbor a standard accretion disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit at @xmath199 , a mass estimation from the assumption of @xmath200 dose not hold for a black hole with a slim disk , where @xmath201 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this is because theoretical simulations on the slim disk widely predict that emission from the accretion flow inside the innermost stable circular orbit becomes not negligible @xcite . in relation ,",
    "apparent dependence of the innermost disk radius ( and hence the luminosity ) upon the disk temperature is suggested from the numerical simulation @xcite as @xmath202 ( corresponding to @xmath203 ) .",
    "similar properties were actually observed from several ulxs within the framework of the standard mcd+pl spectral modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to cope with this problem",
    ", @xcite proposed a simple method .",
    "they fitted the numerically simulated x - ray spectra of a slim disk to the extended mcd model .",
    "they found from some representative values of black hole mass , @xmath204 ",
    "@xmath205 , and accretion rate , @xmath206 ",
    "@xmath207 , that a correction factor needs to be applied to convert the `` apparent '' mass @xmath208 derived from the hypothesis of @xmath200 to the true one as @xmath209  @xmath210 . here",
    ", we follow the technique to estimate the black hole mass of m33 x-8 , assuming that the object accompanies a slim accretion disk .",
    "the innermost disk radius of m33 x-8 , @xmath211 km ( here and hereafter dependence on @xmath143 and @xmath142 is neglected for clarity ) , measured from the xis spectrum with the extended mcd fitting gives the apparent black hole mass as @xmath212 .",
    "adopting the conversion factor of @xmath213 ( for @xmath214 ; @xcite ) , the true mass of m33 x-8 is estimated as @xmath215 .",
    "since the mass corresponds to the eddington luminosity of @xmath216 ergs s@xmath8 , the source is indicated to shine at the sub - eddington luminosity of @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "considering the observational fact that the galactic black hole binaries are known to exhibit the slim - disk - like x - ray properties typically at the eddington ratio of @xmath219 ",
    "@xmath47 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the slim - disk interpretation is thought to become self - consistent for m33 x-8 .",
    "a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) utilized the x - ray model spectrum from a slim accretion disk generated from the numerical simulation by @xcite to claim a super - eddington interpretation for several ulxs , including m33 x-8 @xcite .",
    "these have driven us to investigate the xis spectrum with this model .",
    "the model takes into account the effects of electron scattering and general relativity in detail ( with the parameter model i d set at 7 ) .",
    "we have to note that only the face - on disk geometry ( @xmath106 ) is supposed in the model . by leaving free @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the viscosity parameter @xmath124 , the model yielded a reasonable fit ( @xmath220 ) as shown in the panel ( h ) of figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the physical quantities derived from the slim disk model are tabulated in table [ table : slim_disk ] .",
    "the black - hole mass , @xmath221 , was found to nearly agree with the result from the extended mcd model .",
    "the model requires the viscosity parameter of @xmath222 , which is not deviating far from that usually adopted for ulxs ( @xmath104 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported to prefer a lower mass of @xmath223 , by applying the same model to the xmm - newton spectra of m33 x-8 obtained in the three occasions .",
    "however , we regard that their result is possibly an artifact due to a rather low value of the disk viscosity ( @xmath224 ) adopted in their analysis .",
    "it is important to note that the luminosity of the ulx is indicated to be significantly less than the eddington limit as @xmath225 or @xmath226 , even though the source is suggested to be accreting at a super eddington rate as @xmath227 .",
    "we regard these results as basically supportive of the slim disk idea with the sub - eddington luminosity for m33 x-8 .",
    "however , we have to be careful about a few theoretical and observational uncertainties .",
    "the black hole mass derived from the extended mcd model is subject to the ambiguity in the spectral hardening factor @xmath143 . the numerical model on the slim accretion disk @xcite",
    "is recommended to be calibrated by the galactic black hole binaries with a known mass , although they are known to exhibit rarely the slim disk properties .",
    "in addition , it is expected from recent numerical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the slim disk tends to accompany a strong outflow .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the slim disk is possible to be contaminated from comptonized x - ray photons produced in the outflow .",
    "by making most of the suzaku xis spectrum with the highest signal quality ever recorded , we propose the slim disk scenario for the nearest ulx , m33 x-8 . in addition , both the empirical extended mcd model and the complicated numerical simulation on the slim accretion disk have guided us to the conclusion that the source hosts a black hole with a mass of @xmath228 ( for @xmath106 ) .",
    "if the disk viewing angle is taken into consideration , the mass will become larger as @xmath229 in the simplest manner neglecting the effects of the general relativity .",
    "one of the most remarkable points from this investigation is that the source is found to be radiating at the sub - eddington luminosity , in spite of its super - eddington mass accretion rate .",
    "a similar observational support was revealed by @xcite , to the sub- or trans - eddington luminosity from the slim accretion disk by analyzing the suzaku data for the ulx , source 3 in the nearby galaxy ngc 2403 .    a sub / trans - eddington luminosity is not surprising from the theoretical point of view , even in the case of the super critical accretion flow ( @xmath230 ) , since the luminosity tends to saturate due to strong advection and photon trapping .",
    "actually , a disk luminosity of @xmath231 at most was anticipated from the numerical simulation on the slim disk at the significantly super critical accretion rate as @xmath232 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in summary , we have asserted that it is not necessary to invoke the highly super - eddington luminosity , in order to understand the ulx behavior . by extrapolating this consideration to the ulxs more luminous than m33 x-8",
    ", it is natural to conclude that there are intermediate mass black holes with a mass of @xmath14 among those with @xmath233 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "the bandpass of most operating x - ray instruments limited below 10 kev frequently prevented us to disentangle clearly the degeneracy between the candidate spectral models ( e.g. , the slim disk or cool comptonization model ) .",
    "actually , the capability of the hard x - ray spectrum was certified by the recent suzaku hxd detection of the hard x - rays up to @xmath234 kev from the ulx , m82 x-1 @xcite , since the result have succeeded in specifying the source spectrum as a comptonized emission from a black hole with a mass of @xmath235  @xmath236 . moreover , even in the case that a source is confirmed to host a slim accretion disk , a hard band x - ray spectrum above 10 kev is expected to be useful to eliminate the possible uncertainty due to the contamination from the strong outflow ( see  [ sec : slim ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that a wide - band x - ray spectrum in the range of 0.3  80 kev to be derived with the next - generation japanese x - ray observatory astro - h @xcite will be inevitably play a crucial role to settle the nature of the ulxs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for her / his supportive guidance to improve remarkably the present paper .",
    "we are grateful to all the members of the suzaku team , for the successful operation and calibration .",
