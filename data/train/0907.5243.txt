    "recently graphene , a single - layer hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms , has emerged as a fascinating system for fundamental studies in condensed matter physics , as well as the promising candidate material for future application in nanoelectronics and molecular devices.@xcite the honeycomb crystal structure of single layer graphene consists of two nonequivalent sublattices and results in a unique band structure for the itinerant @xmath0-electrons near the fermi energy which behave as massless dirac fermion .",
    "the valence and conduction bands touch conically at two nonequivalent dirac points , called @xmath1 and @xmath2 point , which form a time - reversed pair , _",
    "i.e. _ opposite chirality .",
    "the chirality and a berry phase of @xmath0 at the two dirac points provide an environment for highly unconventional and fascinating two - dimensional electronic properties,@xcite such as the half - integer quantum hall effect,@xcite the absence of backward scattering,@xcite @xmath0-phase shift of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations.@xcite    the successive miniaturization of the graphene electronic devices inevitably demands the clarification of edge effects on the electronic structures and electronic transport properties of nanometer - sized graphene .",
    "the presence of edges in graphene has strong implications for the low - energy spectrum of the @xmath0-electrons.@xcite there are two basic shapes of edges , _ armchair _ and _ zigzag _ which determine the properties of graphene ribbons .",
    "it was shown that ribbons with zigzag edges ( zigzag ribbon ) possess localized edge states with energies close to the fermi level.@xcite these edge states correspond to the non - bonding configurations as can be seen by examining the analytic solution for semi - infinite graphite with a zigzag edge for which the wave functions of the edge states reside on one sublattice only.@xcite in contrast , edge states are completely absent for ribbons with armchair edges .",
    "recent experiments support the evidence of edge localized states.@xcite also , graphene nanoribbons can experimentally be produced by using lithography techniques and chemical techniques.@xcite    the electronic transport through graphene nanoribbons shows a number of intriguing phenomena such as zero - conductance fano resonances,@xcite valley filtering,@xcite , half - metallic conduction@xcite , spin hall effect,@xcite , and perfectly conducting channel.@xcite recent studies also clarify the unconventional transport through graphene junctions , quantum point contact and heterojunctions.@xcite it is also expected that the edge states play an important role for the magnetic properties in nanometer - sized graphite systems , because of their relatively large contribution to the density of states at the fermi energy.@xcite recent studies explore the robustness of edge states to the size and geometries@xcite , and various edge structures and modification.@xcite    since the graphene nanoribbons can be viewed as a new class of quantum wires , one might expect that random impurities inevitably cause anderson localization , i.e. conductance decays exponentially with increasing system length @xmath3 and eventually vanishes in the limit of @xmath4 .",
    "however , it was shown that carbon nanotubes with long - ranged impurities possess a perfectly conducting channel.@xcite recent studies show that perfectly conducting channels can be stabilized in two standard universality classes .",
    "one is the symplectic universality class with an odd number of conducting channels,@xcite and the other is the unitary universality class with the imbalance between the numbers of conducting channels in two propagating directions .",
    "@xcite the symplectic class consists of systems having time - reversal symmetry without spin - rotation invariance , while the unitary class is characterized by the absence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we will give a brief overview on the electronic transport properties of disordered graphene nanoribbons .",
    "in zigzag nanoribbons , the edge states play an important role , since they appear as special modes with partially flat bands and lead under certain conditions to chiral modes separately in the two valleys .",
    "there is one such mode of opposite orientation in each of the two valleys of propagating modes , which are well separated in @xmath5-space .",
    "the key result of this study is that for disorder without inter - valley scattering a single perfectly conducting channel emerges introduced by the presence of these chiral modes .",
    "this effect disappears as soon as inter - valley scattering is possible . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - energy spectrum of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges ( armchair nanoribbons ) is described as the superposition of two non - equivalent dirac points of graphene . in spite of the lack of well - separated two valley structures ,",
    "the single - channel transport subjected to long - ranged impurities is nearly perfectly conducting , where the backward scattering matrix elements in the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the wavefunction.@xcite for multi - channel energy regime , however , the conventional exponential decay of the averaged conductance occurs .",
    "symmetry considerations lead to the classification of disordered zigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long - range impurities , and the orthogonal class for short - range impurities .",
    "since the inter - valley scattering is not completely absent , armchair nanoribbons can be classified into orthogonal universality class irrespective of the range of impurities .",
    "there are two typical shapes of a graphene edge , called _ armchair _ and _ zigzag_. the two edges have 30 degrees difference in their cutting direction . here",
    "we briefly discuss the way that the graphene edges drastically change the @xmath0 electronic structures.@xcite .",

    "the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are located at @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noted that the ribbon width decides whether the system is metallic or semiconducting . as shown in fig.[fig : armchair ] ( b ) , the system is metallic when @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an integer . for the semiconducting ribbons , the direct gap decreases with increasing ribbon width and tends to zero in the limit of very large @xmath15 . for narrow",
    "non - doped metallic armchair nanoribbons , the energy gap can acquire due to peierls instabilities toward low - temperatures,@xcite which is consistent with the recent density functional theory calculation.@xcite    for zigzag ribbons , however , a remarkable feature arises in the band structure , as shown in figs.[fig : zigzag ] ( a)-(c ) .",
    "we see that the highest valence band and lowest conduction band are always degenerate at @xmath50 .",
    "it is found that the degeneracy of the center bands at @xmath50 does not originate from the intrinsic band structure of graphene sheet .",
    "these two special center bands get flatter with increasing ribbon width .",
    "a pair of partial flat bands appears within the region of @xmath51 , where the bands sit in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the electronic state in the partial flat bands of the zigzag ribbons can be understood as the localized state near the zigzag edge via examining the charge density distribution@xcite .",
    "here we show that the puzzle for the emergence of the edge state can be solved by considering a semi - infinite graphite sheet with a zigzag edge .",
    "first to show the analytic form , we depict the distribution of charge density in the flat band states for some wave numbers in fig.[fig : analy](a)-(d ) , where the amplitude is proportional to the radius .",
    "the wave function has non - bonding character , _",
    "i.e. _ finite amplitudes only on one of the two sublattices which includes the edge sites .",
    "it is completely localized at the edge site when @xmath52 , and starts to gradually penetrate into the inner sites as @xmath5 deviates from @xmath0 reaching the extend state at @xmath53 .",
    "considering the translational symmetry , we can start constructing the analytic solution for the edge state by letting the bloch components of the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) wavefunction be @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57,@xmath54 on successive edge sites , where @xmath58 denotes a site location on the edge .",
    "then the mathematical condition necessary for the wave function to be exact for @xmath59 is that the total sum of the components of the complex wave function over the nearest - neighbor sites should vanish . in fig.[fig : analy](e ) , the above condition is @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the wave function components @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are found to be @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , respectively . here",
    "we can thus see that the charge density is proportional to @xmath70 at each non - nodal site of the @xmath71-th zigzag chain from the edge .",

    "it should be noted that small energy gap can be acquired due to the peierls distortion for half - filling at low temperatures  @xcite , but such effect is not relevant for single - channel transport in the doped energy regime .",

    "the conductance decays rapidly due to the finite ribbon width effect in zigzag ribbons  @xcite while the conductance around @xmath59 remains unity in armchair ribbons ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "now let us see the effect of short - ranged impurities ( sri ) .",
    "figure [ fig2](c ) shows the average conductance @xmath226 as a function of the ribbon length @xmath3 in the presence of sri for several different fermi energies @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", the conductance decays exponentially even for single - channel transport .",
    "this result is similar to that previously obtained in zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "however , the rate of decay in the low - energy single - channel regime ( @xmath229 ) is slower than that for multi - channel transport regime ( @xmath228 ) in this case .",
    "similar results are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in which only short - ranged disorder at the edge of ribbon is considered .",
    "the absence of localization in the single - channel region can be understood from the dirac equation including the impurity potential term @xmath115 with armchair edge boundary . to consider the amplitude of backward scattering , we introduce the @xmath230-matrix defined as @xmath231 we can evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath115 for the eigenstate @xmath232 with the eigenenergy of eq.([eigenenergy ] ) which can be written as @xmath233 with the phase factor @xmath234 here",
    "it should be noted that the phase structure in eq.([wf ] ) is different between @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , and this internal phase structures are critical for the scattering matrix elements of armchair nanoribbons as we discuss in the following . using the above expression",
    ", we can obtain the scattering matrix element @xmath235 with @xmath236 .",
    "\\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that eq.([eq14 ] ) has the same form as that obtained for carbon nanotubes without inter - valley scattering ( @xmath237)@xcite . interestingly , in spite of the fact that armchair nanoribbons inevitably suffer from the inter - valley scattering due to the armchair edges ( @xmath238 ) , we can express the matrix element for the backward scattering as eq.([eq14 ] ) by including @xmath239 into @xmath240 in eq.([eq15 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the different phase structure between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in eq.([wf ] ) .",
    "we focus on the single - channel regime where only the lowest subband with @xmath241 crosses the fermi level . from eq.([eq : u_matel ] ) , the scattering amplitude from the propagating state @xmath242 to its backward state @xmath243 in the single - channel mode becomes identically zero , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath244 thus , since the lowest backward scattering matrix element of @xmath230-matrix vanishes , the decay of @xmath245 in the single channel energy regime is extremely slow as a function of the ribbon length as we have seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "however , the back - scattering amplitude in the second and much higher order does not vanish .",
    "hence the single - channel conduction is not exactly perfect like carbon nanotubes@xcite , but _",
    "nearly _ perfect in armchair nanoribbons .",
    "according to random matrix theory , ordinary disordered quantum wires are classified into the standard universality classes , orthogonal , unitary and symplectic .",
    "the universality classes describe transport properties which are independent of the microscopic details of disordered wires .",
    "these classes can be specified by time - reversal and spin rotation symmetry .",
    "the orthogonal class consists of systems having both time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetries , while the unitary class is characterized by the absence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the systems having time - reversal symmetry without spin - rotation symmetry belong to the symplectic class .",
    "these universality classes have been believed to inevitably cause the anderson localization although typical behaviors are different from class to class .    in the graphene system ,",
    "the presence or absence of the intervalley scattering affect the time reversal symmetry of the system .",
    "if the inter - valley scattering is absent , _ i.e. _ @xmath246 , the hamiltonian @xmath247 becomes invariant under the transformation of @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the complex - conjugate operator .",
    "this operation corresponds to the special time - reversal operation for pseudospins within each valley , and supports that the system has the symplectic symmetry .",
    "however , in the presence of inter - valley scattering due to sri , the invariance under @xmath250 is broken . in this case , the time reversal symmetry across two valleys described by the operator @xmath251 becomes relevant , which indicates orthogonal universality class .",
    "thus as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , graphene with lri belongs to symplectic symmetry , but that with sri belongs to orthogonal symmetry .    however , in the zigzag nanoribbons , the boundary conditions which treat the two sublattices asymmetrically leading to edge states give rise to a single special mode in each valley .",
    "considering now one of the two valleys separately , say the one around @xmath252 , we see that the pseudo trs is violated in the sense that we find one more left - moving than right - moving mode .",
    "thus , as long as disorder promotes only intra - valley scattering , the system has no time - reversal symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "if disorder yields inter - valley scattering , the pseudo trs disappears but the ordinary trs is relevant making a complete set of pairs of time - reversed modes across the two valleys .",
    "thus we expect to see qualitative differences in the properties if the range of the impurity potentials is changed .",
    "the presence of one perfectly conducting channel has been recently found in disordered metallic carbon nanotubes with lri.@xcite the pcc in this system originates from the skew - symmetry of the reflection matrix , @xmath253,@xcite which is special to the symplectic symmetry with odd number of channels .",
    "the electronic transport properties such system have been studied on the basis of the random matrix theory.@xcite on the other hand , zigzag ribbons without inter - valley scattering are not in the symplectic class , since they break trs in a special way .",
    "the decisive feature for a perfectly conducting channel is the presence of one excess mode in each valley as discussed in the previous section .",
    "is the phase coherence length .",
    "@xmath104 is the width of graphene ribbons . ]    in view of this classification we find that the universality class of the disordered zigzag nanoribbon with long - ranged impurity potential ( no inter - valley scattering ) is the _ unitary _ class ( no trs ) . on the other hand , for short - range impurity potentials with inter - valley scattering the disordered ribbon belongs to the _ orthogonal _ class ( with overall trs ) .",
    "consequently we can observe a crossover between two universality classes when we change the impurity range continuously .",
    "however , in the disordered armchair nanoribbons , the special time - reversal symmetry within each valley is broken even in the case of lri .",
    "this is because @xmath238 as we have seen in section [ sec.intervalleyscattering ] .",
    "thus , irrespective of the range of impurities , the armchair nanoribbons are classified into orthogonal universality class .    since the disordered zigzag nanoribbons are classified into unitary class for lri but orthogonal class for sri  @xcite , it should be noted that the universality crossover in nanographene system can occur not only due to the range of impurities but also due to the edge boundary conditions .",
    "the application of a magnetic field enforces the above arguments . in fig.[fig : magneto ] , the magnetic field dependence of the averaged conductance for disordered zigzag nanorribons with ( a ) lris and ( b ) sris is presented .",
    "similarly , the case for armchair nanoribbons with ( c ) lris and ( d ) sris .",
    "here we have included the magnetic filed perpendicular to the graphite plane which are incorporated via the peierls phase : @xmath254 $ ] , where @xmath255 is the vector potential . since the time - reversal symmetry within the valleys for zigzag ribbons is already broken , the averaged conductance @xmath256 for lris ( absence of intervalley scattering ) is quite insensitive to the application of magnetic field as can be seen in fig.[fig : magneto](a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior in the unitary class . for higher energies",
    ", weak magnetic field dependence appears due to the intervalley scattering .",
    "for all the other cases weak magnetic filed improve the conductance , _",
    "i.e. _ weak localization behavior which is typical for the orthogonal class .",
    "is the magnetic flux through a hexagon ring which is measured in units of @xmath257 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented a brief overview on the electronic and transport properties of graphene nanoribbons focusing on the effect of edge shapes and impurity scattering . concerning transport properties for disordered systems",
    "the most important consequence is the presence of a perfectly conducting channel in zigzag nanoribbons , _",
    "i.e. _ the absence of anderson localization which is believed to inevitably occur in the one - dimensional electron system .",
    "the origin of this effect lies in the single - valley transport which is dominated by a chiral mode . on the other hand ,",
    "large momentum transfer through impurities with short - range potentials involves both valleys , destroying this effect and leading to usual anderson localization .",
    "the obvious relation of the chiral mode with time reversal symmetry leads to the classification into the unitary and orthogonal class depending on the range of impurity potential . on the other hand , in spite of the lack of well - separated two valley structures , the single - channel transport subjected to long - ranged impurities shows nearly perfect transmission , where the backward scattering matrix elements in the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the wavefunction .",
    "these results are in contrast with the mechanism of perfectly conducting channel in disordered zigzag nanoribbons and metallic nanotubes where the well separation between two non - equivalent dirac points is essential to suppress the inter - valley scattering .",
