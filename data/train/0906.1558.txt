    "* exotica * and * erotica * differ only in one letter .",
    "they are equally addictive .",
    "like all addictions , they have consequences .",
    "they consume a lot of the resources .",
    "they make you often do things you should not do . * but * , they are exciting , and they give you a great surge of adrenaline .",
    "i have to confess that over the years i have fallen for exotica , and often .",
    "so , let me take you on a personal journey through exotica .",
    "so , what is exotic ? exotic has to be unexpected .",
    "exotic has to have the nature of the `` forbidden fruit '' .",
    "exotic in hadronic physics often begins with provocative suggestions by theorists , which drives experimentalists to search for it , often at * exotic cost * ( think higgs ) . at other times",
    ", it begins with an unexpected experimental observation for which theorists come up with exotic explanations ( think @xmath0 ) .",
    "i want to tell the story of the hadronic exotica , necessarily from a personal point of view .",
    "i began my career as a nuclear physicist .",
    "so , my first run in with exotica was in the search for * exotic nuclei*. nuclei are exotic if they are very rich in neutrons , i.e. , have an exceptionally large value of @xmath1 . , or",
    "if they are just very heavy , @xmath2 . in the 1970 s , there were no easy ways of making a nucleus which was very rich in neutrons , like @xmath3c with 6 protons and 12 neutrons .",
    "and so we went for it by the very exotic pion double charge exchange ( dcx ) reaction @xmath4 .",
    "we discovered @xmath3c by the reaction @xmath5",
    "that was exciting .",
    "as i said before , exotica is addictive .",
    "so , after @xmath3c we went for @xmath6he , 2  protons+7  neutrons , @xmath7 , by means of the reaction @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we found it , and bethe called it * `` a drop of neutron star''*. how much more exotic can you get ?",
    "well , how about @xmath9h by @xmath10 .",
    "we tried and failed to find it , bound or unbound  @xcite .",
    "* so , running after exotica can lead to disappointments .",
    "*    the other end of exotic nuclei is the * superheavy nuclei*. i have never worked in this field .",
    "but berkeley , dubna , and gsi have crossed swords in claims about who has the heaviest of the superheavy .",
    "after some embarrassing incidents , the current winner is @xmath11 with 114 protons and 180  neutrons  @xcite . that is exotic !",
    "quarks carry color , and * only color - neutral hadrons , @xmath12 mesons or @xmath13 , baryons exist * in nature . in the quark bag model  @xcite hadrons with other color - neutral combinations , such as @xmath14 * dibaryons * , or @xmath15 * four - quark",
    "* state can exist .",
    "de swart and colleagues calculated the masses of scores of dibaryons  @xcite and started a stampede for the search of dibaryons .",
    "lots of people started looking for dibaryons in their old experiments , analyzing old bubble chamber pictures and claiming observation of scores of dibaryons .",
    "as many as 40 dibaryon states were claimed in the mass range @xmath16  mev  ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we thought we could become famous by pinning these dibaryons down since we had orders of magnitude greater luminosity and energy resolution available at the los alamos meson factory . instead of becoming * famous * for discovering dibaryons",
    ", we became * infamous * for killing all of them .",
    "no dibaryons anywhere in fig .  2 .",
    "at @xmath17  mev , @xmath18 : vertical lines mark the masses of the dibaryons claimed .",
    "( upper panel ) differential cross sections .",
    "( lower panel ) analyzing powers.,title=\"fig:\",width=201 ]   at @xmath17  mev , @xmath18 : vertical lines mark the masses of the dibaryons claimed .",
    "( upper panel ) differential cross sections .",
    "( lower panel ) analyzing powers.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]",
    "but that is not the end of this story . if not two baryons making a dibaryon , how about a baryon@xmath19a meson , or a color - neutral pentaquark ?",
    "it surfaced a few years ago by the claim by nakano et al .",
    "of a narrow peak , called @xmath20 , with a mass of @xmath21  mev , @xmath22  mev , in the invariant mass of @xmath23 in the reaction @xmath24",
    "@xcite . if true , it would have strangeness  + 1 and at least five quarks / antiquarks .",
    "the object was so exotic that a stampede of * confirming * claims flooded the literature . an equal number of non - observations were reported .",
    "if you go to google , you find 99,800 entries for pentaquark ( before this symposium ) , and it will be difficult to decide whether the pentaquark is alive or not .    in a high - statistics repeat of their own measurement , jlab found that their own earlier observation of @xmath20 was false and no evidence for the existence of the pentaquark exists  @xcite .",
    "however , rumor has it that nakano et al .",
    "claim that they still see the pentaquark in a high - statistics remeasurement .",
    "* so , once claimed , an exotic is difficult to kill !",
    "* i end with a quote from pdg08 summarizing the saga of the pentaquark : _ `` the whole story  the discoveries themselves , the tidal wave of papers by theorists and phenomenologists that followed , and the eventual * ` undiscovery ' *  is a curious episode in the history of science . '' _",
    "since glue carries color , it is possible to have hadrons build of pure glue , called glueballs @xmath25 , and hybrid mesons containing glue , @xmath26 .",
    "these have been predicted since the inception of qcd @xcite .",
    "glueballs have generally the same @xmath27 as @xmath28 mesons , and they mix with them .",
    "it is therefore essentially impossible to find a pure glueball .",
    "nevertheless , brave searches and claims and counter ",
    "claims have been made .",
    "the summary of the situation is that pieces of the @xmath29 glueball are mixed into at least three well  known isoscalar mesons , @xmath30 and the pure exotic , @xmath31 has been lost .",
    "a tensor @xmath32 glueball has had equally disappointing fate .",
    "it has surfaced many times , but i believe it was firmly put to rest by us in a @xmath33 measurement at lear ( cern ) @xcite",
    ".    hybrids @xmath26 have an advantage over glueballs .",
    "they can have @xmath34 which are not permitted for @xmath28 mesons .",
    "such objects are manifestly exotic . in our @xmath35 experiment ( e852 ) at bnl we claimed to have discovered at least three @xmath36 mesons @xmath37 , and a @xmath38 meson @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "i have to admit that while these hadrons are definitely not @xmath28 mesons , they also admit the possibility of being four  quark states , and not hybrids . in either case",
    "they are exotic .",
    "the @xmath40 h dibaryon was predicted by jaffe  @xcite , but it became so exotic that it was even considered a candidate for dark matter .",
    "stubborn searches for the h were made for years at brookhaven and kek .",
    "the @xmath41 quark dibaryons died a long time ago , but the h dibaryon lived longer . by now , however , by common consensus it is also considered dead . for",
    "a detailed history see  @xcite .",
    "in dec . 1974 , a large narrow peak was disocvered at @xmath42  gev mass at brookhaven and slac  @xcite in @xmath43 formation and @xmath44 decay .",
    "it was the @xmath45 which launched the era of modern quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is amusing to note that barely four weeks later * eight papers * by theoretical physicists ( including four nobel laureates ) appeared in the jan . 6 , 1974 issue of physical review letters  @xcite ,",
    "offering explanations of what @xmath0 might be .",
    "several of them were truely exotic explanations , like @xmath0 was a bound state of a baryon / antibaryon , or two spin ",
    "one mesons , or it was a member of a @xmath46 dimensional representation of su(4 ) .",
    "* tells you that nobody is immune to the seduction of exotica .",
    "*    i have been talking too much about the exotics which failed to materialize .",
    "let me now , for awhile , focus on exciting physics which is * not exotica , but excitica * ( my construct for something very exciting ) .    ) and charmonium ( @xmath47 ) spectra.,width=499 ]",
    "the qcd potential which arises due to the exchange of a massless vector * photon * is @xmath48 .",
    "the qcd potential due to the exchange of a massless vector * gluon * is @xmath49 . because free quarks do not exist",
    ", in qcd there is an additional confinement term proportional to @xmath50 .    with such close analogy to qed",
    ", it is interesting to compare the qcd spectrum of charmonium with the qcd spectrum of positronium , with masses and interactions miles apart .",
    "the similarity is nothing short of fantastic . *",
    "nature repeats herself ! * with energy scales different by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "the coulombic @xmath52 part of the qcd interaction gives rise to the usual spin dependence in the potential , with spin - orbit , tensor , and spin - spin components , in addition to the central part .",
    "of these three , arguably the most important is the spin - spin interaction .",
    "for example , the ground state masses of @xmath28 mesons are : @xmath53\\ ] ] in order to determine the hyperfine interaction , @xmath54 , it is necessary to measure the * hyperfine splitting * between the spin  singlet and spin  triplet states .",
    "this means identifying and measuring the massses of @xmath55 and @xmath56 states .",
    "the masses of * spin  triplet * @xmath55 states , @xmath57 and @xmath58 states are well - determined because either they are directly populated in @xmath43 annihilation @xmath59 or they are reached by strong e1 transitions from the @xmath60 states @xmath61 .",
    "the * spin  singlet * states @xmath62 can not be directly formed , and radiative transitions to them from spin  triplet states are either forbidden or weak m1 .",
    "the net result is that our knowledge of the spin ",
    "singlet states , and therefore of the hyperfine interaction , has been very poor in the past .",
    "very recently this has changed .    wave bound states of charmonium and bottomonium as a function of the radius of the @xmath28 potential.,width=230 ]     produced in @xmath63 fusion , ( right ) @xmath64 produced in @xmath65 . , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   produced in @xmath63 fusion , ( right ) @xmath64 produced in @xmath65 . , title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]    for heavy quark systems , @xmath47 charmonium , and @xmath66  bottomonium , we would like to know how the hyperfine interaction changes as we move from the coulomb dominated region of the @xmath28  potential to the confinement dominated region",
    ". we would like to study the change in the hyperfine interaction    1 .   between @xmath67 and @xmath68 2 .   between @xmath67 and @xmath69 3",
    ".   between @xmath67 and @xmath70    until recently",
    ", the only hyperfine splitting known was for the charmonium @xmath71 states ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath72 * @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 * were not even identified . in the last five years , all this has changed due to the measurements at belle , babar , and cleo .",
    "the results are : @xmath76 even more recently babar has claimed the identification @xmath77 with the result @xmath78 an overall understanding of these hyperfine splittings is going to be a challenge to the theorists .",
    "i now return to the domain of exotica . recently",
    ", a number of new states have been claimed in the mass region 38004700  mev , above the @xmath79 breakup of charmonium at 3730  mev .",
    "three years ago , all that was known above @xmath79 was four vector states @xmath80 observed as enhancements in the ratio , @xmath81 .",
    "however , the great excitement , often called the * renaissance * in hadron spectroscopy , has come from the recent discovery of a whole host of unexpected states by the meson factory detectors , belle and babar .",
    "the new states are called * `` charmonium - like states '' * , not because they naturally fit into the spectrum of charmonium states , but because they seem to always decay into final states containing a charm quark and an anti - charm quark .",
    "there are at least eleven of them around .",
    "the alphabet soup is getting thick with reports of x(3872 ) , y(4260 ) , y(4361 ) , y(4660 ) , x(3940 ) , y(3940 ) , z(3940 ) , x(4160 ) , z@xmath82(4430 ) , z@xmath83(4051 ) and z@xmath84(4248 ) . except for the first two , x(3872 ) and y(4260 ) , which have been observed in measurements at several laboratories , the remaining nine come exclusively from belle .",
    "they have not been reported by babar with similar capabilities , and in two cases , y(4325 ) and the @xmath85 , they have been contradiected by babar",
    ". reminds you of the old dibaryon story .",
    "i do not want to express my skepticism any further , but tell you only about the two certain exotics , x(3872 ) and y(4260 ) .",
    "this narrow state with @xmath86  mev , and @xmath87  mev , has been observed by belle , babar , cdf , d , and it definitely exists .",
    "[ pdg08 ] cdf angular correlation studies show that its @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "x(3872 ) does not easily fit in the charmonium spectrum . since its mass is very close to @xmath90",
    ", the most popular conjecture is that it is a weakly * bound molecule * of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "if so , our recent precision measurement of @xmath93 mass at cleo gives @xmath94  mev .",
    "this corresponds to x(3872 ) being * unbound * by @xmath95  mev .",
    "if x(3872 ) were even bound by @xmath96  mev , the branching fraction for the molecule s breakup into @xmath97 is predicted to be factor 400 smaller than observed .",
    "these observations raise serious doubts about the molecular model for x(3872 ) .",
    "stop the presses : cdf now reports  @xcite @xmath98  mev .",
    "so we now have x(3872 ) bound by @xmath99  mev .",
    "the problem of the almost - bound / unbound nature of x(3872 ) is getting more and more sharply defined , and it is getting to be more and more exotic .",
    "the y(4260 ) has been observed in isr production by babar , cleo and belle , and in direct production by cleo .",
    "y(4260 ) is clearly * a vector * with @xmath100 .",
    "all known charmonium vectors are seen prominently as huge enhancements i hadronic decays , usually measured as the ratio @xmath101 . but this vector is a very strange one , since it sits at a very deep minimum in r , with @xmath102 so it is not likely to be a charmonium vector , which are all spoken for , anyway .",
    "so what is y(4260 ) ?",
    "it is suggested that y(4260 ) is a @xmath103 charmonium hybrid .",
    "if so , there ought to be @xmath104 and @xmath36 hybrids companions nearby .",
    "where are they ? it is a real experimental challenge to clarify this situation before taking any theoretical conjecture seriously .",
    "the sum total of the experiences in this journey through hadronic * exotica * is that the journey is certainly worth it .",
    "it is unquestionably exciting .",
    "but the road is full of pitfalls and disappointments ."
