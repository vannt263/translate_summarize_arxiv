    "the absence of a gap beyond zero in the pair correlation measure arises as a result of this estimate .",

    "in this section we recall the definition of reciprocal geodesics and explain how the pair correlation of the angles they make with the imaginary axis is related to the pair correlation considered in the introduction .",
    "we also show that the sums over the semigroup @xmath120 appearing in the introduction can be expressed geometrically in terms of sums over primitive reciprocal geodesics .",
    "a description of the trajectory of reciprocal geodesics on the fundamental domain seems to have first appeared in the classical work of fricke and klein @xcite , where it is shown that they consist of two closed loops , one the reverse of the other .",
    "there the terminology `` sich selbst inverse classe '' is used for the equivalence classes of quadratic forms corresponding to reciprocal conjugacy classes of hyperbolic matrices .",

    "the group that fixes the semicircle @xmath123 ( or equivalently its endpoints on the real axis ) is generated by one primitive element @xmath127 .",
    "we are concerned with ( oriented ) closed geodesics passing through @xmath128 on @xmath4 .",
    "since the axis of a hyperbolic element @xmath129 passes through @xmath32 if and only if @xmath129 is symmetric , the closed geodesics passing through @xmath128 correspond to the set @xmath130 of hyperbolic conjugacy classes @xmath121 which contain a symmetric matrix .",
    "the latter are exactly the reciprocal geodesics considered by p. sarnak in @xcite , where only primitive geodesics are considered .",
    "the reciprocal geodesics can be parameterized in a 2 - 1 manner by the set @xmath131 , defined in the introduction , which consists of matrices distinct from the identity with nonnegative entries . to describe this correspondence ,",
    "let @xmath132 be the set of symmetric hyperbolic matrices with positive entries .",
    "then we have maps @xmath133 where the first map takes @xmath134 to @xmath135 , and the second takes the hyperbolic symmetric @xmath129 to its conjugacy class @xmath136 .",
    "the first map is bijective , while the second is two - to - one and onto , as it follows from @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath137 is a primitive matrix , then @xmath138 is the only other matrix in @xmath139 conjugate with @xmath129 , and @xmath140 for all @xmath141 .",
    "note also that @xmath142 , and if @xmath129 is hyperbolic with @xmath143 , then the length of the geodesic associated to @xmath136 is @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "we need the following :    [ l1 ] let @xmath146 be a hyperbolic symmetric matrix and let @xmath147 such that @xmath135 . then the point @xmath36 is halfway _ ( _ in hyperbolic distance _ ) _ between @xmath32 and @xmath148 on the axis of @xmath129 .",
    "we have @xmath149 where the first equality follows from the hyperbolic distance formula and the second since @xmath13 acts by isometries on @xmath0 . using formula , one checks that the angles of @xmath150 and @xmath151 are equal , hence @xmath36 is indeed on the axis of @xmath129 .",
    "we can now explain the connection between the angles @xmath15 in the first and second quadrant in figure [ figure2 ] , and the angles made by the reciprocal geodesics with the image @xmath152 .",
    "namely , points in the first and second quadrant are parameterized by @xmath36 with @xmath153 , and by the lemma the reciprocal geodesic corresponding to @xmath154 consists of the loop @xmath155 , followed by @xmath156 ( which is the same as the reverse of the first loop ) . therefore to each reciprocal geodesic",
    "corresponding to @xmath157 correspond two angles , those attached to @xmath36 and @xmath158 in figure [ figure2 ] , measured in the first or second quadrant so that all angles are between 0 and @xmath159 .    in conclusion the angles made by the reciprocal geodesics on @xmath4 with the fixed direction @xmath160 consist of the angles in the first quadrant considered before , each appearing twice .",
    "ordering the points @xmath161 in the first quadrant by @xmath162 corresponds to ordering the geodesics by their length .",
    "therefore the pair correlation measure of the angles of reciprocal geodesics is @xmath163 , where @xmath49 was defined in the introduction .",
    "the parametrization of reciprocal geodesics allows one to rewrite the series appearing in the formula for @xmath164 in the introduction , as a series over the primitive reciprocal classes @xmath165 : @xmath166 where we have used the fact that for a hyperbolic matrix @xmath129 of trace @xmath113 we have @xmath167    one can rewrite the sum further using the arithmetic description of primitive reciprocal geodesics given in @xcite .",
    "namely , let @xmath168 be the set of nonsquare positive discriminants @xmath169 with @xmath170 and @xmath171 odd divisible only by primes @xmath172 .",
    "then the set of primitive reciprocal classes @xmath165 decomposes as a disjoint union of finite sets : @xmath173 with @xmath174 , the number of genera of binary quadratic forms of discriminant @xmath175 . for @xmath176 ,",
    "@xmath177 equals @xmath178 , or respectively @xmath179 depending on whether @xmath180 , or respectively @xmath181 , and @xmath182 is the number of distinct odd prime factors of @xmath175 .",
    "each class @xmath183 has @xmath184 with @xmath185 the minimal positive solution to pell s equation @xmath186 .",
    "we then have @xmath187    in the same way , by lemma [ l15 ] the pair correlation measure @xmath56 in theorem 1 can be written for @xmath188 as a sum over classes @xmath189 , where each summand depends only on @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "in this section we establish notation in use throughout the paper , and we reduce the pair correlation problem to considering angles in the first quadrant in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "a similar reduction can be found in @xcite , in the context of visibility problems for the hyperbolic lattice centered at @xmath32 .",
    "for each @xmath192 define the quantities @xmath193 note that @xmath194 .",
