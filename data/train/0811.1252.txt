    "low ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) , the dominant population of active galaxies in our local universe ( e.g. stauffer 1982 ; ho , filippenko and sargent 1997 ) , remain one of the most captivating and generally elusive subsets of galaxies . originally classified using ratios of oxygen emission lines with low ionization potentials ,",
    "the principal mechanism responsible for their optical spectra has been the subject of debate for almost 30 years ( e.g. heckman 1980a and b , veilleux and osterbrock 1987 , ho , fillipenko and sargent 1997 , satyapal et al .",
    "2004 , dudik et al .",
    "2005 , gonzalez - martin et al .",
    "this is in part because the observed optical spectrum can be explained by a variety of different physical processes ( including photoionization from hot stars , shocks , or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ) ( heckman 1980b , baldwin , phillips , and terlevich 1981 , ferland & netzer 1983 , halpern & steiner 1983 , veilleux and osterbrock 1987 , dopita & sutherland 1995 , and sugai & malkan 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , it is clear that the liner class as a whole is not homogeneous , and only a fraction contains accreting black holes ( heckman 1980 , ho et al .",
    "2001 , nagar et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 , dudik et al .",
    "2005 , satyapal et al . 2005 ) .    while extensive optical spectroscopic studies have been carried out to determine the number of agns in liners ( heckman 1980a&b , ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a , ho et al .",
    "1997b ; kim et al .",
    "1995 , veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ) , surprisingly few systematic , multi - wavelength comparisons on a representative set of liners have been conducted .",
    "this is a serious shortcoming since we now know that the majority of liners are bright in the far - infrared ( fir ) and have large fir to b - band flux ratios , implying that they are heavily obscured ( carrillo et al . 1999 ,",
    "satyapal et al .",
    "2004 , dudik et al .",
    "in such cases , the optical emission lines can be dominated by the contribution from star forming regions in the host galaxy .",
    "thus in order to get a true census of the number of liners containing agn , the investigation should be carried out at wavelengths less sensitive to host galaxy contamination that are also less affected by gas and dust obscuration .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy and x - ray observations are generally considered the ideal tools for uncovering agn in liners .",
    "the mid - ir contains a number of high ionization lines that are unambiguous agn diagnostics .",
    "high ionization lines , such as the [ nev ] 14 and 24@xmath0 m lines ( ionization potential = 97ev ) are prominent in standard agn and not readily produced in hii regions ( satyapal et al .",
    "2008 , abel & satyapal 2008 ) , the ionizing source in star forming regions ( genzel et al . 1998 , sturm et al .",
    "2002 , satyapal et al .",
    "detection of either the [ nev ] 14 or 24@xmath0 m lines provides strong evidence for the presence of an agn and has been used to detect active black holes in galaxies that show no signatures of them in their optical spectra ( satyapal et al .",
    "2007 , satyapal et al .",
    "2008 , abel & satyapal 2008 ) .",
    "similarly , hard x - rays ( 2 - 10kev ) are a powerful tool for finding obscured agn since they are produced in the inner hottest regions of the source , are relatively insensitive to host galaxy contamination , and are not significantly affected by absorption .",
    "several preliminary investigations employing mid - ir or x - ray observations to search for agn in relatively small samples of liners have been carried out so far ( e.g. , ho et al . 2001 ; eracleous et al . 2001 ; satyapal , sambruna & dudik 2004 , dudik et al . 2005 ; satyapal et al .",
    "2005 ) , but no large - scale study of a representative sample of liners that compares the multi - wavelength properties and detection rates has yet been undertaken .    in light of this deficiency , we conducted an exhaustive search for liners observed by the high resolution ( hr ) modules of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ in order to determine the fraction that show mid - ir signatures of agns and to compare this detection rate with that obtained using other detection methods .",
    "this survey includes 67 liners and represents the largest mid - ir spectroscopic survey of liners to date .",
    "in addition this is the only study that includes extensive observations of the [ nev ] line in liners , the only robust agn indicator in the mid - ir .",
    "the principal goal of our study was to determine the fraction of liners showing definitive agn signatures at mid - ir wavelengths and to compare this fraction with the agn detection rate obtained using x - ray and optical surveys .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the properties of the _ spitzer _ sample .",
    "section 3 describes the data reduction and analysis for the mid - ir observations . in section 4",
    "the mid - ir agn detection rate is presented and in section 5 this mid - ir detection rate is compared with other multi - band agn indicators . in section 6",
    "the mid - ir line ratios in liners are examined and these ratios are compared with others from a sample of standard agns .",
    "finally , a summary of the major conclusions is given in section 7 .",
    "the majority of liners are luminous in the far - ir ( fir ) and span a wide range of far - ir to optical b - band ratios ( ir - brightness ratios , carrillo et al . 1999 ,",
    "satyapal et al .",
    "2004 , dudik et al .",
    "2005 , satyapal 2005 ) . indeed , using the sample from carrillo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which represents the largest compilation of liners to date , 70% of liners have fir luminosities in excess of 10@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 ( or @xmath3 10@xmath4 l@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , a statistically significant , representative sample of liners requires inclusion of both ir - bright and ir - faint liners .",
    "the sample of liners presented here is derived from the palomar survey of bright nearby galaxies ( containing predominantly ir - faint liners , h97 ) and the veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter v95 ) sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( containing ir - bright liners ) . for consistency , we excluded all galaxies that did not adhere to all four of the veilleux et al .",
    "( 1987 ) optical liner classification criteria , since this scheme is the least sensitive to observational effects associated with optical spectroscopy such as reddening , line blending and abundance sensitivities .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure 10 suggests that sed effects are not responsible for the low values of [ nev]14@xmath0 m luminosity seen in the [ nev]-emitting liners in figures 8 and 10 .",
    "rather they suggest that the 14 @xmath0 m [ nev ] emission is deficient , and that this deficiency is due to substantial extinction toward the [ nev ] emitting region rather than an intrinsic optical / uv deficit . in support of these findings ,",
    "desai et al . ( 2007 ) find that nearly all ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with liner - like optical nuclei in their sample show silicate optical depth , @xmath6@xmath7 in excess of 2.5 , implying optical depths , a@xmath8 @xmath9 45 .",
    "at least for the luminous infrared galaxies plotted here , the [ nev ] 14@xmath0 m deficiency can easily be explained by such high columns of dust ( see also dudik et al .",
    "we note that the data in figures 8 - 10 is sparse , because there is currently very little [ nev ] high - resolution data in the literature either for standard agn or for liners .",
    "[ nev ] 24@xmath0 m data and [ oiv ] data is particularly scarce .",
    "using the high resolution irs modules on board spitzer , we conducted an archival mid - ir spectroscopic study of 67 liners in order to search for mid - ir signatures of agns .",
    "this is the most exhaustive mid - ir spectroscopic survey of liners to date and includes observations of the mid - ir [ nev ] emission lines , the only robust spectroscopic diagnostic of an agn in the mid - ir .",
    "these results are compared with similar observations of standard seyferts and quasars .",
    "our main results are as follows .    1 .",
    "we detect the [ nev ] 14 and/or 24 @xmath0 m line in 26 of the 67 galaxies in our sample .",
    "this yields a mid - ir agn detection rate of 39% .",
    "we find that many galaxies ( 23% ) show prominent [ nev ] emission but no evidence for agn activity in the optical .",
    "this result emphasizes that optical observations fail at finding a significant fraction of agn in liners .",
    "this is particularly true in fir luminous galaxies , the dominant and least studied population of liners .",
    "the fraction of liners with [ nev ] emission increases with fir luminosity , implying that large fraction of the dominant population of liners are agn .",
    "we find some inconsistencies between [ nev ] non - detections and either the presence of broad h@xmath10 or the presence of a hard x - ray point source .",
    "this inconsistency is likely due to the limited sensitivity of the mid - ir observations and/or the misclassification of optical and x - ray sources .",
    "5 .   using the combined x - ray , optical , and ir diagnostics",
    ", we find an agn - detection rate in liners of 74% , higher than previously reported .",
    "contrary to previous studies , a comparison of the mid - ir line ratios in liners and standard agn suggests that the ionizing seds in at least some liners are not significantly different from those of standard agn .",
    "we find that the [ nev]14@xmath0m/ [ nev]24@xmath0 m , line flux ratios in liners are significantly below the theoretical low density limit and substantially lower than the same ratios in standard agn .",
    "this result suggests that there is high extinction , even at mid - ir wavelengths , toward the [ nev]14@xmath0 m line emitting region in a significant number of liners .",
