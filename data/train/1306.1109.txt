    "trapped ions are among the most promising systems for the realization of a quantum computer .",
    "while excellent control over single qubits@xcite , high fidelity entangling of two qubits@xcite , simple quantum algorithms@xcite and entangling of up to 14 qubits@xcite have been demonstrated , the scaling to large numbers of qubits remains challenging due to the increasingly complex mode spectrum of large ion crystals .",
    "performing high fidelity quantum gate operations even in long linear ion crystals@xcite using optimized laser pulses@xcite is an highly interesting yet challenging approach to scale up the number of qubits available for quantum information processing with trapped ions .",
    "the idea of mode shaping has the potential to drastically simplify this approach since the complexity of the mode spectrum can be significantly reduced .",
    "such tailoring of vibrational modes may be possible employing the unique properties of rydberg states@xcite , where the polarizability of the ion is strongly enhanced leading to significant modifications of the radial trapping potential@xcite .",
    "equally fascinating is the perspective of spin - dependent trap - ion interactions exhibiting a strength rivalling the coulomb forces , such that structural configuration changes of ion crystals are induced .",
    "again , rydberg excitations have been proposed to induce such a phase transitions@xcite between a linear string and a zigzag crystal .",
    "hence , rydberg excitation of ions may be used to quench an ion crystal@xcite , producing a non - equilibrium situation and eventually even enter the quantum regime@xcite of this phase transition .",
    "the experimental work presented here features important aspects of mode shaping using mixed crystals with doubly charged ions instead of rydberg excitations .",
    "we investigate in detail radial modes and configuration changes , thus providing a complete understanding of the mode shaping which would be required for quantum gate operation .",
    "for the measurements we benefit from the effectively infinite lifetime of @xmath0ca@xmath2 ions as compared to a lifetime of about 100@xmath3s for a rydberg excitation . the presented experiments with @xmath0ca@xmath2 ions can be considered as an important step towards mode shaping experiments with rydberg excitations .",
    "still , one important aspect of the proposed mode shaping and ion crystal configuration is not captured : only coherent rydberg excitation would give complete control over these effects , including superposition states .",
    "we generate mixed coulomb crystals consisting of ions with a large difference in charge - to - mass ratio by ionizing single @xmath0ca@xmath1 ions with a vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) source@xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the vuv source can be changed from ionisation to rydberg excitation wavelength and a very similar excitation scheme is used in both cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after describing the experimental setup we introduce the photoionisation scheme for selectively ionizing trapped @xmath0ca@xmath1 . in the following",
    "we describe the frequency measurement of various modes of mixed crystals and compare the results to simulations .",
    "we also investigate structural changes of the crystals , as depending on the trap parameters and the position of the @xmath0ca@xmath2 ion . in a last section",
    "we investigate local modes created by a @xmath0ca@xmath2 impurity in a longer ion chain .",
    "the ions are trapped in a linear paul trap ( fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] , described in detail in@xcite ) consisting of four cylindrical electrodes ( diameter 2.5 mm ) and two endcaps ( distance 10 mm ) with holes ( diameter 1 mm ) to provide axial optical access to the ions .",
    "the paul trap is operated with an rf - amplitude of @xmath4 = 100v - 200v at a frequency @xmath5/(2@xmath6 ) = 10.66mhz .",
    "an additional offset voltage of @xmath7 = -1.5v is applied to the dc - electrodes to lift the radial degeneracy of the trapping potential .",
    "the resulting trapping frequencies are @xmath8/(2@xmath6 ) = 150khz - 500khz and @xmath9/(2@xmath6)= 450khz - 650khz depending on the rf - amplitude .",
    "the endcaps are operated at a dc voltage of 400v which yields an axial trapping frequency of @xmath10/(2@xmath6 ) = 119khz .",
    "the ions are produced by photoionisation with a pulsed laser at @xmath11 nm from a neutral atom beam of @xmath0ca .",
    "ions are cooled and repumped by copropagating laserbeams at wavelengths of @xmath12 nm , @xmath13 nm and @xmath14 nm . with a diode laser at @xmath15 nm ions can be optically pumped into the @xmath16d@xmath17 state with nearly 100% efficiency .",

    "the imaging system consists of a lens with focal length 66.8 mm which maps the ion crystal via a folding mirror on an emccd ( electron multiplying charge coupled device ) chip .",

    "the three fundamental lasers are tuned close to the transitions @xmath23s@xmath24p@xcite , @xmath25p@xmath26s and @xmath27s@xmath28p in mercury , respectively , which significantly increases the yield of vuv power to about 1@xmath3w at 121.26 nm .",

    "the vuv radiation propagates through holes in the endcaps of the trap and is detected with a photo multiplier tube ( pmt ) behind the trap .",

    "hence , modes can be excited by applying a resonant radiofrequency to one of the dc - electrodes .",
    "we concentrate on the radial modes of the crystal since these are the most interesting for mode shaping .",

    "the highest frequency modes where the @xmath0ca@xmath2 exhibits an approximately 50 times higher oscillation amplitude than the @xmath0ca@xmath31 are missing in the plot because they could not be measured exactly .",
