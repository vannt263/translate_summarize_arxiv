    "the two merger nuclei of arp 220 , about 300 pc apart on the sky ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* pc ) , generate at least 40% of the total luminosity of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( @xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "each has a rotating gas disk of about 100 pc extent , the rotation axes of which are misaligned with one another @xcite .",
    "the central 5080 pc of the brighter western nucleus has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath1 according to sub - arcsec imaging of submillimeter continuum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a kpc - scale molecular disk surrounding the two nuclei @xcite .",
    "ir absorption analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest the dominant luminosity source of arp 220 to be compact and deeply buried , as expected in the two nuclear disks , rather than widely spread , as expected in the outer disk .",
    "both nuclear disks host starbursts with dozens of radio supernova remnants @xcite and may also contain a buried quasar ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "properties of the nuclear disks , including their structure , kinematics , and gas conditions , must be elucidated in order to understand fully the nature and evolution of activity in arp 220 . in this _",
    "letter _ we report our high - resolution observations of arp 220 in ( sub)millimeter molecular lines , including its first subarcsecond resolution imaging in   and the first detection of p - cygni line profiles toward the two nuclei .",
    "we observed co(32 ) and ( 43 ) simultaneously in 2007 may and ( 32 ) in 2008 august using the most extended configuration of the submillimeter array ( sma ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also used the most compact configuration in 2009 january to measure the total ( 32 ) flux .",
    "system gain was calibrated using two nearby quasars , j1635 + 381 and j1613 + 342 .",
    "the passband over our 2 ghz - wide sidebands was calibrated using other brighter quasars .",
    "the data were reduced mostly the same way as in @xcite . continuum in each sideband was collected from the channels outside of radial velocities between 4800 and 5900  in co(32 ) , ( 43 ) and ( 32 ) , and hcn(43 ) lines .",
    "the continuum was then subtracted in visibilities from line data .",
    "phase self - calibration was made using the continuum of arp 220 .",
    "line data were binned to 30  resolution and have velocities in the radio convention with respect to the lsr .",
    "our spatial resolution is about 03 or 100 pc and our co(32 ) data are twice as sensitive as those in @xcite .",
    "since co(32 ) was placed at the band center , our velocity coverage for ( 43 ) in the image band is limited to 5180  6840 .",
    "we detected , co , and @xmath21 mm continuum emission associated with the two nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ f.maps ] ) .",
    "the western nucleus is more luminous than the eastern , by a factor of 23 in  and continuum .",
    "the concentration of  emission to the two nuclei is real because we detected most of the total line flux in arp 220 ( table [ t.param ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to co(32 ) where only 23% of the single - dish flux was recovered even though co(32 ) and ( 43 ) had almost the same u - v coverage .",
    "co(32 ) emission is indeed extended on scales greater than 2  in @xcite .",
    "thus ( 43 ) and ( 32 ) emission of arp 220 is mostly from the two nuclear disks while the majority of co(32 ) comes from the outer disk around them .",
    "moreover , in each nuclear disk , the  emitting region is more compact than the co emitting region judging from their half - peak sizes in fig . [ f.maps ] .",
    "the peak brightness temperatures ( ) of the lines at or around each nucleus , listed in table [ t.param ] , indicate warm molecular gas in the nuclear disks .",
    "the co peaks are about 50 k and  about 20 k. these high  and high -to - co intensity ratios in the nuclear disks imply that molecular gas exists there in conditions favorable for the transitions of high critical density .",
    "the line spectra at the two nuclei , in fig .",
    "[ f.spectra ] , show both emission and absorption . in particular , all the observed lines except co(32 ) toward the western nucleus show blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission , i.e. , p - cygni profiles .",
    "this feature is absent in our calibrator spectra .",
    "the western nucleus has a narrow , deep absorption feature at 5340   and emission at higher and lower velocities in our co data .",
    "this profile is consistent with the previous co(21 ) profile in @xcite except that the absorption is deeper in our co(32 ) data .",
    "the deep absorption is almost at the systemic velocity of the nucleus , marked with a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f.spectra ] , as expected if the co - absorbing gas is in circular rotation in the western nuclear disk .",
    "the systemic velocity , @xmath3 , was estimated from the central velocity of the co profile in the low - resolution ( 05 ) data of @xcite , measured at half - maximum .",
    "the ( 43 ) and ( 32 ) lines are also in absorption at the systemic velocity .",
    "in addition , both  lines have absorption at blueshifted velocities while most of their emission appears at redshifted velocities .",
    "the ( 32 ) profile shows multiple velocity components in absorption ; the minima at 4890 , 5220 , and 5340   are at 3.6 4.6 , and 4.6 , respectively .",
    "absorption deeper than 3  is seen down to @xmath4 .",
    "the eastern nucleus has very asymmetric line profiles with respect to its systemic velocity , which we estimate to be @xmath5   in the same way as for the western nucleus . in all the observed lines ,",
    "absorption is predominantly seen at or blueward of the systemic velocity while most emission is in redshifted velocities , making the profiles p cyg type .",
    "the deepest absorption is at 4575  below ( e ) and is 2.8 , 4.5 , and 3.0  in ( 43 ) , ( 32 ) , and co(32 ) , respectively .",
    "absorption ( i.e. , negative intensity ) in our continuum - subtracted data means absorption of the continuum , because line self - absorption alone can not produce _ negative _ intensity . in order to absorb continuum",
    "the excitation temperature of the foreground gas must be below the brightness temperature of the background continuum .",
    "the ( deconvolved ) western nucleus has = 90160 k and a size of 5080 pc in 860  continuum ( @xcite ; for the sed of the two nuclei see @xcite ) .",
    "the high , due to high dust opacity in submillimeter , makes line absorption against dust continuum more likely to occur ( and deeper ) than at longer wavelengths .",
    "the maximum apparent optical depth of each absorption line is in the range of 0.41.0 except the ( 32 ) optical depth of 3.7 ( or @xmath61.4 when allowing for 1 @xmath7 error ) toward the eastern nucleus .",
    "the total line absorption @xmath8 integrated over the velocities where @xmath9 is , in the order of ( 43 ) , ( 32 ) , and co(32 ) , 75 , 150 , and 50  toward the eastern nucleus and 85 , 82 , and 15  toward the western .",
    "the absorption profiles vary among the lines , more notably toward the western nucleus .",
    "there are two caveats to keep in mind .",
    "first , our observations provide lower limits to total absorption because emission from the absorbing gas itself and from ambient ( i.e. , non - absorbing ) gas in our beam masks the absorption .",
    "second , our synthesized beam is larger for ( 32 ) than for ( 43 ) and co(32 ) .",
    "the absorbing column density @xmath10 is on the order of @xmath11   for the co absorption and @xmath12   for the  if the absorbing gas is in 50 k lte and abundances are [ co/ ] @xmath13 and [ / ] @xmath14 .",
    "the high abundance adopted for  is consistent with recent pdr and xdr models @xcite , as well as models of  enhancement in protostellar outflow shocks @xcite .",
    "the absorbing gas will have a depth on the order of 110 pc if its density is at the co(32 ) critical density of @xmath15 .",
    "the actual absorbing material can be distributed over a longer length if it is inhomogeneous as in numerical hydrodynamical simulations of multi - phase gas obscuring active nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the column densities of the absorbing gas calculated here have large uncertainties because the absorption data provide lower limits , gas excitation conditions are poorly known , and molecular abundances can significantly vary .",
    "still , it is possible for the absorbing column density to take these values because they are smaller than the total column density of the nuclei ( @xmath16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the remarkable detection of vibrationally excited hcn in absorption in arp 220 @xcite suggests that the excitation of  may also be more unusual than described by our simple analysis .",
    "more realistic models of the excitation and radiative transfer of both molecules , including radiative coupling to the intense infrared continuum , will be explored in a future publication .",
    "rotation of gas around each nucleus is evident in the co(32 ) position - velocity diagrams ( fig . [ f.pv ] ) as the negative to positive shift of @xmath17 across the nucleus .",
    "the co emission ranges from 5000 to 5900  around the western nucleus .",
    "the high - velocity gas around 58005900  is detected at @xmath63  for the first time .",
    "the fall - off of the rotation velocity away from the nucleus agrees with the co(21 ) observations by @xcite and suggests truncation of the mass distribution of the nucleus beyond a @xmath18100 pc core .",
    "radial motion of gas , in addition to the rotation , is suggested by the blueshifted absorption mentioned above .",
    "the absorbing gas must be in front of the continuum core of each nucleus and moving away from it toward us .",
    "although absorption only tells us the gas motion along our lines of sight to the continuum nuclei , the detection of similar blueshifted absorption on both nuclei whose nuclear disks are misaligned suggests that the gas motion is more likely a radial outflow in most directions than non - circular motion only along our sight lines .",
    "the redshifted emission in the p - cygni profiles must then contain emission from gas on the far side of the continuum nuclei and moving away from the nuclei and us .",
    "the other emission in the spectra must be from the gas rotating in the nuclear disks .",
    "the typical outflow velocity of the absorbing gas is probably about 100  because the deepest absorption in the p - cygni spectra is between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "high - velocity components up to 500  are suggested toward the western nucleus by the ( 32 ) absorption with large velocity offsets .",
    "the absorbing gas is turbulent or has a velocity gradient across each continuum nucleus because absorption is also seen at slightly positive velocities with respect to systemic .",
    "the mass of the outflowing gas and the mass outflow rate would be on the order of @xmath21  and 100  if the outflowing gas with a column density of @xmath12 h@xmath22   is mostly within a radius of 50 pc ( see  [ s.loc_absorber ] ) and has an isotropic outward velocity of 100 .",
    "note however that these numbers strongly depend on the geometry of the gas flow .",
    "the blueshifted absorbing gas is probably located in the two nuclear disks .",
    "this is likely because  _ emission _ is concentrated to the two nuclear disks .",
    "the nuclear disks thus have significant column densities of  excited to the j=3 and 4 levels , whether the excitation is collisional ( with critical densities of @xmath23@xmath24  at 50 k ) or by radiation . the j=3  in front of a bright source causes ( 4@xmath253 ) absorption .",
    "since column densities of excited   must be less outside the nuclear disks according to our observations , any external gas is unlikely to be the dominant absorber .    in our preferred model",
    ", each nuclear gas disk has an inner region with significant outflow motion and an outer region dominated by rotation .",
    "this configuration can partly explain why the p - cygni profiles are more prominent in  than in co. excited  is more concentrated toward the outflowing disk centers , while for extended co more emission from the rotating ( i.e. , non - outflowing ) disk likely masks absorption by the outflowing gas .",
    "it is also likely that the lower excitation temperature of  expected from its larger einstein a coefficients makes it a better absorber than the co at the same location with a higher excitation temperature .",
    "the rotation - dominated part of the nuclear disk is likely the site of possible weak hnc maser that @xcite suggested for the western nucleus on the basis of a narrow and bright spectral feature at the systemic velocity .",
    "a less likely location of the absorbing gas is a few 100 pc or more from the two nuclear disks",
    ". the gas may be a part of the merger s large - scale ( @xmath6 10 kpc ) superwind perpendicular to the kpc - scale outer molecular disk @xcite .",
    "the 5340  absorption toward both nuclei could be explained by this common envelope model .",
    "however , the total mass of such a gas structure would be quite large ; @xmath26 for an expanding envelope of 500 pc radius and a column density of @xmath27 .",
    "such an expanding molecular envelope has not been detected in emission .",
    "observational signs of outflows from individual nuclei in arp 220 have been scarce despite ample observations of the merger s superwind at larger scales .",
    "a biconical distribution of oh maser around the western nucleus along its rotation axis ( i.e. , n - s direction ) was observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "@xcite suggested that this emission as well as the faint hnc emission they found to be extended in the same direction may be due to an outflow from the nucleus . while kinematical evidence for the outflow is absent or inconclusive in these subarcsecond resolution observations , @xcite detected highly blueshifted oh maser emission with a 2  beam and attributed it to an outflow at 10100 pc from the luminosity source with wind acceleration modeling . in  observations by @xcite , velocities of the main absorption toward the nuclei",
    "are @xmath28(e , main ) = 5396  and @xmath28(w , main ) = 5325 after conversion from optical - heliocentric to radio - lsr .",
    "they are marginally blueshifted , by 19 and 30 , from our co - based systemic velocities .",
    "also , the  absorption toward the western nucleus has a subcomponent at about @xmath2980 from the main component . these may be related to the molecular outflows that we suggest .",
    "the compact and luminous sources in the nuclei probably make the outflows inevitable .",
    "for example , supernovae inject @xmath30 j of mechanical energy into the western nucleus in 1 myr for the supernova rate of 3  that @xcite observed .",
    "( the rate is 1  for the eastern nucleus . )",
    "if 10% of this is passed to kinetic energy of @xmath31  of gas , the gas velocity will be 500 .",
    "gas at shallow parts of the gravitational potential or getting more energy than average will escape the nucleus .",
    "although the outflow may be mostly ionized , it will entrain molecular gas on its way .",
    "radiation pressure on dust also drives an outflow in the case of a very compact starburst or an agn buried in dust @xcite .",
    "the momentum of a @xmath21  gas outflowing at 100  is equivalent to the total momentum of photons that a @xmath32  source radiates in 0.5 myr .",
    "such an outflow may be more isotropic near its origin than the outflow caused by a disk starburst and would be more significant in the inner region of each nuclear disk because the radiation pressure declines with radius as @xmath33 .",
    "the winds are important for the evolution of the nuclear disks because they remove the shroud of and fuel for the buried energy sources .",
    "the small crossing time of the nuclear winds over each disk , @xmath181 myr , is suggestive in terms of the evolution .",
    "it is either that we are seeing very young winds or that the gas motion in each disk is not purely outward in every direction despite the large opening angles of the outflows inferred in ",
    "[ s.dynamics ] . for the latter ,",
    "it is conceivable that high - density gas in the mid - plane of each nuclear disk is little affected by the outflow and even has inward motion due to viscosity to replenish gas to the center , as in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the nuclear gas disks is then determined by the balance of the gas accretion , gas outflow , and gas consumption by star formation and agn until the coalescence of the nuclei and of the gas disks .",
    "we are grateful to the sma staff who made these observations possible .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments and k. s. thanks dr .",
    "keiichi wada for stimulating discussion .",
