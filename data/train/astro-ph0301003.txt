    "the 3  visual pair hd  28867 ( hr  1442 ; sao 94002 ) is one of the brightest stellar x - ray sources in the taurus - auriga star formation region .",
    "hoffleit ( 1982 ) lists the spectral type as b9  ivn .",
    "late  b stars are not usually bright x - ray sources . that this system is a member of an active star forming region suggests that either young b stars may be bright x - ray sources in some cases , or that the system may hide a less massive but very active pre - main sequence star .    the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) quotes @xmath3 and @xmath4  mag .",
    "the individual @xmath5 magnitudes are 6.99 and 7.04 .",
    "the position angle of the pair is 277.1@xmath6 , with a separation of 3.078 .",
    "the two stars , which we refer to as the east and west components , have a common proper motion , with no significant change in position angle or separation seen in 113 years ( hoffleit 1982 ) .",
    "worley & douglass ( 1997 ) make no mention of a change in position angle or separation in 159 years of observations ( 1830 - 1989 ) .",
    "the east component is the primary .",

    "the star was , however , detected as a bright x - ray source with the einstein observatory imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) in observation sequences 867 and 10538 .",
    "walter et al . ( 1988 ) quoted a count rate of 0.12  c  s@xmath2 .",

    "white , pallavicini , & kundu ( 1992 ) detected hd  28867 with a 6  cm flux of 0.36  mjy in a radio survey of selected pms stars .",
    "they were unable to establish which star in the binary system was coincident with the radio source .",
    "the radio flux is comparable to that of radio - bright low mass pms stars in tau - aur , and they speculated that the source might be an unseen companion .",
    "this system is iras point source 04306 + 1754 .",
    "it was detected at 12@xmath0 m with a flux of 0.48  jy ; upper limits on the flux at 25 and 60@xmath0 m are 0.58 and 0.40  jy , respectively .",
    "the system was not resolved by iras .",
    "walter & boyd ( 1991 ) showed that hd  28867 shares the space motion and parallax of the tau - aur star forming region .",
    "the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) provides a parallax of 7.71  mas ( milli - arcseconds ) , for a distance of 130@xmath1023  pc .",
    "hd  28867 appears to be an intermediate mass member of the tau - aur association , on or near the zero - age main sequence with an age of no more than a few million years . at this distance",
    "the x - ray luminosity is about 10@xmath16  erg  s@xmath2 , which makes it one of the most x - ray luminous stars associated with the taurus - auriga complex .",
    "only hd  283572 ( walter et al . 1987 ) is more luminous in the damiani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) compilation of einstein ipc observations of tau - aur ; none of the t  tauri stars in the rosat survey ( neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) exceed this luminosity . that it is a bright and variable x - ray source , a radio source , and",
    "is detected by iras at 12@xmath0 m , strongly suggests that hd  28867 is more interesting than the typical b9 star .",
    "the glare of the bright b stars may hide a lower mass companion , or the young b9 stars themselves may be magnetically active as a consequence of extreme youth . here",
    "we present multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations which clarify the nature of hd  28867 .",
    "along the main sequence , the mean @xmath17 ratio reaches a minimum among the late - b / early - a stars ( e.g. , pallavicini et al .",
    "this is consistent with expectations , as these stars lack the strong winds ( and resulting shocks ) of the most massive stars ( but see feigelson et al .",
    "2002 ) , and lack the deep convection zones which generate and amplify the magnetic fields of the cool stars ( daniel , linsky & gagn 2002 provide a more comprehensive review of these issues ) . while o stars follow the trend @xmath1810@xmath19 , cassinelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that @xmath17 decreases monotonically from about 10@xmath19 at spectral types",
    "b0-b1 to a few@xmath1210@xmath20 at spectral type b3 , among stars not known to be multiple .",
    "schmitt et al . ( 1993 ) reported detections of three of six late  b ( b7-b9 ) primaries in wide visual pairs ( resolved in the rosat hri ) , with log(@xmath17 ) between -6.1 and -4.9 , but schmitt ( 1997 ) failed to detect x - ray emission from any of the three a stars earlier than spectral type a7 in a complete sample of stars within 13  pc ( there are no b stars in this sample ) .",
    "so while a few late  b / early  a stars not known to be binaries may be bright x - ray sources , most are not .",
    "a simple way to add excess x - ray flux to late  b / early  a stars is to provide a lower mass binary companion . given the main sequence lifetimes of these stars , the cool star is likely to be young and active .",
    "golub et al . ( 1983 ) and caillault & helfand ( 1985 ) were the first to suggest that the x - ray bright late  b / early  a stars are close binaries with an active cool star .",
    "white et al . ( 1992 ) suggested this very explanation for the x - ray and radio activity in hd  28867 .",
    "this would not be the first example of a late  b / cool star binary in a star forming region .",
    "casey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the x - ray emitting late  b  star ty  cra in the cra star formation region is a triple system , consisting of two lower mass convective stars in addition to the b8 - 9 primary .",
    "the x - ray flux is consistent with that expected from the brightest low mass pms stars , such as hd  283572 ( walter et al .",
    "1987 ) , which is approximately the same mass and spectral type as the ty  cra secondary .",
    "close binary systems are common , and on a statistical basis there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that late  b  stars in star forming regions are intrinsic x - ray sources : caillault , gagn , & stauffer ( 1994 ) showed that the fraction of b  star x - ray sources in the orion nebula region was just that expected to be close binaries with late - type companions .",
    "feigelson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concur , and show that the x - ray luminosities require f / g type companions , rather than k / m companions .",
    "jefferies , thurston , & pye ( 1997 ) reach the same conclusion in the ngc  2516 cluster ( they also suggest that magnetic chemically peculiar b and a stars are more likely to be detected as x - ray sources than are normal late - b and a stars , either because they are intrinsically brighter or because they are more likely to have a binary companion ) . daniel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report that two mid - b and a pleiads with f - g companions are detected in a chandra observations , while two a stars not known to have cooler companions are not detected .",
    "based on luminosity functions and hardness ratios , hulamo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also argue that the bright , hard x - ray sources in unresolved lindroos ( 1986 ) pairs must be late - type companions . indeed , using diffraction - limited near - ir images , hulamo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) resolved one of three late - b lindroos systems into the b star and a pre - main sequence k star .",
    "the alternative hypothesis is that hd  28867 , a young intermediate mass star , may retain some vestige of primordial magnetic activity , a `` naked '' herbig  ae star , so to speak .",
    "zinnecker & preibisch ( 1994 ) show that x - ray luminosities of some of the more extreme herbig ae stars , including hr  6000 , mcw  10980 , and z  cma , are comparable to that of hd  28867 , but hd  28867 is not known to have any of the other spectroscopic characteristics of the herbig  ae stars .",
    "giampapa , prosser , & fleming ( 1998 ) argued that two mid - b stars in the pleiades - age cluster ic  4665 are intrinsic x - ray sources .",
    "these stars , with spectral types b5iv and b6v , are hotter and more masive than the stars in hd  28867 .",
    "hd  28867 exhibits a flux ratio @xmath17  =  10@xmath21 ( berghfer et al . 1996 ) when referenced to the combined light of both stars .",
    "this is clearly much larger than expected for a single , non - chemically peculiar b9 star .",
    "in table  [ tbl - optpos ] we present the positions of the visible stars , taken from the `` double and multiples : component solutions '' section of the hipparcos and tycho catalogs .",
    "we determined absolute positions in the k - band image ( figure  [ irimage ] ) by using a reference grid of three stars from the usno a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) which were also detected in this image .",
    "the hd  28867 pair is unresolved in the usno a2.0 catalog .",

    "we generated aperture correction tables using the standard stars .",

    "the x - ray column of 10@xmath22  @xmath14 corresponds to a@xmath23=0.21  mag ; the observed @xmath24=0.23  mag of the west component requires a@xmath23=0.25  mag if this b9 star has intrinsic colors of 0 .",

    "three observations , a low dispersion swp spectrum , and high dispersion swp and lwp spectra , were taken with the target in the large aperture .",
    "the pair is unresolved in the large aperture ; the spectra look like those of late - b stars .",
    "we obtained followup swp - hi spectra in 1994 , using the iue small aperture to separate the two components , as part of program bxpfw .",
    "we first centered the star in the fes , slewed to place the light centroid in the small aperture , and then performed blind offsets of the telescope by + 1.5,-0.25 in ra , dec for the east component , and by -1.65,+0.25  for the west component .",
    "the archival swp  49847 spectrum is mis - calibrated as a large aperture observation ( the script correct labels it as a small aperture observation ) .",
    "we compensated for this by multiplying the calibrated flux by the small - to - large aperture ratio in the file _",
    "swpabscal.fit_.    the iue small aperture has a 3.0 arcsec diameter , so there may be some contamination from the other star , especially if there was some small error in the centroiding or the offset slews .",
    "based on the fes offsets , the final separation between the two apertures on the sky is 2.7 , which is less than the true binary separation .",
    "the east component appears about twice as bright as the west component in the extracted spectrum , which suggests that either the west component was not well centered in the aperture , or that the east spectrum includes some light from the west component .",
    "the summed flux is about half the flux in the large aperture observation , swp  31968 .",

    "we used a 1  slit oriented e - w with a 4  decker length . with one star centered in the slit , the other star was visible at the end of the decker .",
    "we extracted the spectra by fitting two gaussians at each wavelength coordinate , and taking the integral of the gaussian as the number of counts at that wavelength .",
    "the ti2 ccd gave a wavelength coverage of about 5450 to 7200 .",
    "integration times were 50 and 60 seconds , respectively , for the e and w components .    on 24 january 1997 , under excellent seeing conditions , we reobserved the pair .",
    "the moon was about 2 days past full , but was below the horizon at the time of the observations .",
    "we used the same slit and decker , but off - centered the target near the end of the decker to minimize contamination from the companion .",

    "the tk2b ccd provided wavelength coverage from about 4300 to 7400 . each star was observed for 5 minutes . because we used a simple boxcar extraction rather than an optimal extraction , the s / n is limited by pixellation in the image .",

    "this behavior makes us wary that there may be some unknown systematic problem with the hd  28867 pair observations , despite the good behavior of the standard stars .",
    "we note that abt & biggs ( 1972 ) and hoffleit ( 1982 ) note that hr  1442 may be a radial velocity variable .",
    "two published values differ by 15  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is not clear whether these refer to the combined light of the pair , in which case the interpretation is complicated .",
    "we obtained speckle images of hd  28867 on the evening of 2001 january 12 using the facility ir camera `` nsfcam '' at the irtf in non - photometric conditions .",
    "we used the 0.055  pix@xmath2 plate scale to obtain three hundred 0.078 second speckle exposures in each of the j , h and k photometric bands .",
    "we used a shift - and - add analysis method to produce the final images .",
    "frames that had less than 30% of the peak flux in the best image were excluded as images that were taken in poor instantaneous seeing conditions .",
    "the j , h and k - band images were thus constructed from centroiding and combining the best 169 , 207 and 224 frames , respectively .",
    "the speckle image of hd  28867e in the k - band shows only a single source , with a spatial profile indistinguishable from that of hd  28867w ( fig .",
    "[ fig - kspec ] ) . to estimate limits",
    "at which we can detect a companion to hd  28867e , we determined the sensitivity to companions at a range of brightnesses and separations .",
    "in figure  [ fig - ksens ] we present the sensitivity ( @xmath46k ) versus angular separation as derived using hd  28867w as a point spread function calibrator .",
    "the sensitivity at the projected separation from the central star is essentially the limiting magnitude at this distance , ten times the standard deviation over the mean counts in each 2 pixel wide annuli .",
    "based on the k - band speckle analysis , we can rule out with confidence a late type companion with a k - band brightness within 1 magnitude of that of the b star at a separation of more than 0.25 .",
    "this corresponds to a projected separation of 32  au .",
    "a cool companion to hd 28867e will be brighter at the longer wavelengths , so there could be a slight positional shift in the separation between the stars as a function of wavelength . to test this , we measured the spatial separations between the two stellar centroids . there is no significant difference between the separations in the 3 bands , and no trends with wavelength .",
    "the mean separation between the centroids in the j , h , and k band images is 3.070@xmath100.004 .",
    "the separation between the optical components from the hipparcos measurements is 3.078@xmath100.004  ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for a significant shift in the centroid position between the optical , where the light from a cool component is insignificant , to the k band .",
    "formally , the optical and near - ir position angles are significantly different , at a level of 1.00@xmath100.14@xmath47 , corresponding to a northward shift of 0.98 pixels in the east component . however , given the accuracy to which the camera orientation is known , this is probably not significant .",
    "if we accept that the relative shift between the optical and near - ir centroids is no more than one 0.055  pixel , then we can put another limit on the maximum separation of the two stars .",
    "we show below (  [ sec - ss ] ) that any cool component is roughly as bright as the b star in the k band . a shift in the centroid of @xmath310.055",
    "therefore requires a projected separation @xmath310.11  ( 14  au ) .",
    "this is consistent with the speckle sensitivity estimate shown in figure  [ fig - ksens ] for @xmath46k=0  mag .",
    "on 29 december 2001 we used the spex ( rayner et al 1998 ; 2002 ) low resolution spectrograph in the short wavelength , cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode , to obtain a spectrum from 0.8 through 2.5  @xmath0 m at a spectral resolution of about 1500 .",
    "conditions were photometric .",
    "we observed in ab mode , with a 100  throw .",
    "we observed the brighter east component for 8 minutes ( 30 second integrations , 2 coadds , 8 ab cycles ) , and the west component for 12 minutes .",
    "we also observed the south component for 16 minutes .",
    "we extracted the spectra using the spextool software version 2.1 .",
    "we flatten the spectra by assuming that the continuua of the a0 stars follow f@xmath48 power laws .",
    "we then merged the individual orders into a single spectrum .",
    "we used the observed fluxes of the a0 stars , assuming @xmath24=0 , to correct to absolute fluxes .",
    "we derive a k magnitude of 6.79 for the west component from the spex spectrophotometry .",
    "this is within 2% of the photometric magnitude .",
    "the derived k magnitude of 6.07 for the east component is 0.1  mag brighter than the photometric magnitude ( table  [ tbl - irphot ] ) .",
    "since there is no evidence for intrusion of light from the ( fainter ) west component into the slit , the spectra were taken back - to - back , and the calibrations are stable , this may be evidence of variability of the cooler companion . variability will be small in the optical , where the cool companion contributes only a few percent of the flux .",
    "spectra of hd  28867e and w are shown in figure  [ fig - sp ] . a spectrum of hd  28867s , scaled up by a factor of 10 , is also shown in figure  [ fig - sp ] .",
    "the west component is a good approximation to the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody , while the east component has excess flux at long wavelengths .",
    "the south component is a good match to an m1 star .",
    "this spectral type is consistent with the jhk colors .",
    "the ratio of the flux in the east and west components is shown in the upper trace in figure  [ fig - sprat ] .",
    "the emission in the h  i paschen and brackett series is an artifact of the division process ( the lines are proportionately shallower in the east component , after dilution ) .",
    "the stars were observed consecutively , at airmass less than 2 , and most of the telluric absorption features divide out .",
    "however , after division there are apparent narrow absorption lines in the flux ratio .",
    "inspection of the spectra shows that they are in absorption in the east component .",
    "the absorption features in the k  band are identified in figure  [ fig - expsprat ] .",
    "we identified the absorption features by comparison with a solar ir atlas ( livingston & wallace 1991 ) .",
    "the absorption lines are those of neutral species ( , , , , ) , as well as the co @xmath49=2 bandheads .",
    "this suggests a cool stellar component of spectral type g - k , in good agreement with the optical absorption line spectrum .",
    "on the assumption that hd  28867e is a composite of a late  b star and a cool dwarf , we used the near - ir spectrum and an atlas of near - ir spectral standards to estimate the properties of the cool dwarf .",
    "we observed the near - ir spectral standards ( spectral types g1 through l2 ) during the same observing run , and with the same instrumental setup .",
    "the radial velocity template and the iue spectra suggest that hd  28867e is somewhat cooler than hd  28867w .",
    "therefore , we modelled the b star with a range of temperatures , from 1500k cooler than the west component to the same temperature .",
    "we used the spectrum of the west component , scaled by the ratio of blackbodies at the two temperatures , as the template for the b star component .",
    "we then subtracted this b star model from the spectrum , and fit the difference spectrum , f@xmath50 ) . at each spectral type , we scale the flux of the standard to match the excess flux , and then subtract the standard .",
    "ideally , the residuals will be uniformly zero for the correct choice of companion .",
    "we determine a best fit companion spectral type from the colors of the difference spectrum , by a @xmath51 analysis of the residuals , and by fitting the slope and curvature of the residuals .",
    "the best spectral type for a companion with dwarf colors ranges from early - g to mid - k , depending on the assumed temperature of the b star ; more luminous companions will have earlier spectral types . in table  [ tbl - comp ] we list the derived parameters of the companion over the tested range of b star temperatures .",
    "the spectral type is determined by comparison with the spectral energy distributions of the ir standards .",
    "the radius is derived from the flux normalization .",
    "the magnitudes in table  [ tbl - comp ] have been corrected for a@xmath23=0.25  mag .",
    "in addition , we present the ratios of the b star to companion flux in the r@xmath52 and k bands .",
    "the range of possible locations of the companion in the h - r diagram is shown in figure  [ fig - hrd ] .",
    "note that this analysis considers only the broadband spectral energy distribution , and not the information in the spectral lines .",
    "we generated synthetic optical spectra by adding the spectrum of hd  28867w ( the b9 template ) and g - k spectra diluted by the appropriate factor ( see table  [ tbl - comp ] ) .",
    "prior to adding the spectra , we added a li  i line with an equivalent width corresponding to a cosmic abundance log  n(li)=3.3 ( pavlenko & magazzu 1996 ) , appropriate for a pms star , and then smoothed the spectrum to approximate a rotational broadening @xmath53=65  km  s@xmath2 . the middle traces in figure  [ fig - optsp ] show this synthetic spectrum for a g2 companion .",
    "it successfully reproduces the broad spectral lines , including li  i  @xmath366707 , in the spectrum of hd  28867e . by visual inspection of these composite spectra",
    ", we were able to exclude a companion as late in spectral type as k5 , but we can not distinguish between a g2 and k0 companion .",
    "the increase in the spectral dilution in the cooler stars almost exactly compensates for the deepening lines , and the rapid rotation washes out all but the strongest features , which are not strongly sensitive to temperature in this range    the lower trace in figure  [ fig - sprat ] shows the ratio of the observed flux from hd  28867e to this synthetic spectrum in the near - ir .",
    "the spectral energy distributions match , as do the lines in the k band .",
    "in particular , the @xmath54 co bandheads and the @xmath362.21@xmath0 m na  i doublet and @xmath362.26@xmath0 m ca  i triplet go into emission ( are undersubtracted ) if we force the companion spectral type later than about k0",
    ".    greene & meyer ( 1995 ) and hodapp and deane ( 1993 ) have quantified relations between various absorption line indices and t@xmath55 or spectral type . prior to measuring the lines",
    ", we accounted for telluric absorption by dividing the spectrum by the normalized spectrum of an a0 star observed at the same air mass .",
    "the equivalent widths of the na  i doublet and the ca  i triplet in the difference spectrum depend on the selected temperature differential .",
    "even after correcting for the telluric absorption , the continuum is not well defined , and lines are blended , at this resolution . the summed equivalent width ( greene and meyer s atomic index ) range from 2.5  for a 1500k temperature differential to 3.0  for no differential .",
    "this corresponds to spectral type k0v to k2iii , which is slightly cooler than indicated by the broadband spectral energy distribution or the optical lines .",
    "the co bandheads subtract well for late - g spectral types ; the gravity dependence of the co bandheads permit stars as cool as early - to - mid  k for luminosity class iii ( see figures  8 and 10 of hodapp & deane 1993 ) .",
    "we conclude that this star does not support the premise that that late - b stars can be intrinsically luminous x - ray sources .",
    "hd 28867e is a composite of a late b star and a cooler pms star .",
    "this conclusion is based on optical and near - ir spectroscopy , as well as the near - ir photometry .",
    "the spectroscopic data limit the spectral type of the companion to between about g0 and k0 , with the spread due to the uncertainty of the temperature of the b star component .",
    "uncertainties in the reddening can not affect the shape of the near - ir spectral energy distribution sufficiently to affect this conclusion .",
    "one can refer to the location of the companion in the h - r diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hrd ] ) to draw further conclusions .",
    "there we show the location of the star referenced to evolutionary tracks and isochrones from baraffe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) .",
    "the baraffe et al .",
    "tracks use a mixing length equal to the pressure scale height and y=0.275 ; the dantona & mazzitelli tracks are those using mixing length convection and alexander opacities . note that the tracks and isochrones differ . the baraffe et al .",
    "tracks incorporate more recent input physics , but are lacking above 1.4  m@xmath56 . from the baraffe et al .",
    "tracks , we can conclude that the mass exceeds about 1.2  m@xmath56 , and that the age , at least at the red end of the allowable range , is 1 - 3  myr , consistent with the age of the tau - aur t  association .",
    "the dantona and mazzitelli tracks permit a younger and less massive star . for reference ,",
    "the open circle shows the location of hd 283572 , one of the brightest low mass pms stars in taurus .",
    "for a temperature difference of 1000k , the spectrophotometric deconvolution leaves a hot component with @xmath5=6.92 and @xmath24=0.03 ( unreddened ) .",
    "this star is 0.13  mag fainter than the west component . using the simple relations that the @xmath5  band flux will be proportional to r@xmath57 t , that r@xmath30 m , and that t@xmath30m@xmath58 , where r , t , and m are respectively the stellar radius , mass , and temperature , we expect a star 1000k cooler than the west component to be about 14% fainter .",
    "this consistency adds confidence to our spectrophotometric deconvolution .",
    "the x - ray and radio emission is fully consistent with this interpretation of the system as a b star and a cooler companion .",
    "the iras 12@xmath0 m flux is inconsistent with this , as it overestimates the flux , extrapolated from k by @xmath59 , by a factor of 4 .",
    "this could be attributable to a circumstellar disk around one or both of the stars .",
    "the disk would need to have a substantial inner hole , as it does not appear to contribute significantly in the k  band .    with the data in hand",
    ", we can start to constrain the orbit of the system ( assuming this is no chance projection ) . the cool star is brighter than the b star in the k band so long as the spectral type is earlier than k0 ( table  [ tbl - comp ] ) .",
    "the 14  au limit from the k band imaging is a limit for the semi - major axis for circular orbit .",
    "the system is unlikely to be oriented pole - on .",
    "the @xmath3065  km  s@xmath2 line width constrains the rotation period to be less than 2.0  ( r/2.6  r@xmath56 )  days .",
    "this is consistent with the rotation periods of the more massive of the low mass pms stars , and suggests that the inclination @xmath42 exceeds about 30@xmath6 ( corresponding to a 1  day rotation period ) .",
    "if the rotation and orbital axes are coaligned , this @xmath42 applies to the binary system as well .",
    "no evidence has been reported for an optical eclipse , so the inclination must be less than 90@xmath6 , but this is not a strong constraint since the semi - major axis is likely to be large compared to the stars .",
    "a b9 star has a mass of about 3  m@xmath56 .",
    "it is unfortunate that the b star radial velocity measurements are inconclusive , since for reasonable secondary masses ( @xmath10.5  m@xmath56 ) the radial velocity of the b star should vary by @xmath14  km  s@xmath2 . for orbital inclinations",
    "@xmath6030@xmath6 , and 0.5@xmath31m@xmath61/m@xmath622.0 , the semi - major axis of the system lies between about 0.8 and 4.7  au ( 6  36  mas ) , and the orbital period lies between about 4 months and 5.5  years .",
    "all these values are overestimates , given that we only have a lower limit on the orbital v  @xmath63 of the secondary .",
    "further observations will throw more light on this system .",
    "we have renewed our efforts to determine the radial velocities of the b stars in the hd  28867 pair using the echelle spectrograph at the arc 3.5-m telescope .",
    "high dispersion spectra in the red and near - ir can be used to determine the orbit of the cool companion , and high dispersion , high s / n spectra in the near - ir will yield better limits on the spectral type .",
    "diffraction - limited k - band imaging on a larger telescope may be able to directly resolve the system .",
