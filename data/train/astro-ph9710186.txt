    "due to their high luminosity and relative simplicity , x - ray clusters provide one of the most precise measurements of the amplitude of mass fluctuations in our universe .",
    "combined with the observed anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation , it serves as a key constraint on cosmological models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , a number of unresolved difficulties in our understanding of clusters .",
    "these include the refusal of clusters to agree with some analytic scaling laws ( @xcite ) , a result which adiabatic simulations seem unable to explain ( @xcite ) . also , the apparent decrease in the number of x - ray clusters at high redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is unexpected in the context of many popular models as well as being discrepant with optical observations of rich , distant clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "having fixed the number density of clusters at @xmath1 , the rate of evolution is a strong indicator of cosmology , especially with regard to the value of @xmath2 , thus it is important to better understand the structure and formation of x - ray clusters .",
    "while n - body studies provide much useful information ( @xcite ) , clusters are observationally identified either through their galaxies or by x - ray emission from a hot gas component . since galaxies are very difficult to model correctly , and do not provide as straightforward a tracer of clusters as x - ray observations , we turn to the baryonic gas .",
    "most studies of individual x - ray clusters incorporating hydrodynamics have employed lagrangian , particle - based methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) methods provide excellent spatial resolution when combined with a suitable gravity solver , their shock - capturing capabilities are not as good as modern eulerian methods .",
    "however , most cosmological eulerian codes are hampered by a fixed grid and so provide good resolution in low - density regions , but poor resolution in high - density regions , such as the centers of x - ray clusters ( @xcite ) .    here , we present first results from a new method which is designed to provide adaptive resolution combined with a shock - capturing eulerian hydrodynamics scheme .",
    "this adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique provides high resolution within small regions , the location of which are controlled automatically ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the piecewise parabolic method , adapted to cosmology ( @xcite ) , for the baryons , particles for dark matter and a high - resolution gravity solver ; however , due to space constraints , we defer discussion of the methodology to a future paper .",
    "we have simulated the formation of an adiabatic x - ray cluster in an @xmath3 universe .",
    "the initial spectrum of density fluctuations is cdm - like with a shape parameter of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) ; the cluster itself is a constrained 3-@xmath5 fluctuation at the center , for a gaussian filter of 10 mpc .",
    "we use a hubble constant of 50 km / s / mpc and a baryon fraction of 10% .",
    "this cluster is the subject of a comparison project between twelve different simulation methods , the results of which will be presented in an upcoming paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation was initialized with two grids .",
    "the first is the root grid covering the entire 64 mpc@xmath6 domain with @xmath7 cells .",
    "the second grid is also @xmath7 cells but is only 32 mpc on a side and is centered on the cluster .",
    "thus , over the region that forms the cluster , we have an initial cell size of 500 kpc leading to an approximate mass resolution of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) for the baryons ( dark matter ) .",
    "we adopt a refinement mass for the baryons of @xmath10 ( i.e. if the mass in any cell exceeds this value a finer mesh is created ) , but only allow refined grids within a box @xmath11 mpc on a side , centered on the cluster center since we are uninterested in objects outside this volume .",
    "some objects will collapse outside this region and then move inside ; these halos will not be properly modelled as high resolution is required throughout an object s evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus mostly on the properties of the central cluster , which collapsed entirely within the refined region .",
    "we have also run a set of amr simulations for the same cluster with lower mass resolution and initial power in order to examine numerical convergence .    in figure",
    "[ fig : level_example ] , we show a typical example of the grid layout in this simulation .",
    "the top panel depicts the dark matter distribution in order to show the collapsed structure .",
    "a projection of the level hierarchy in shown below , with grids colour - coded by level .",
    "we do not show the full three - dimensional layout since , with about 400 grids , this would be too complicated to extract much useful information ; however , the grid ` shadows ' do demonstrate that the grid structure mirrors the mass morphology .",
    "the range of grid sizes and shapes is diverse , but most tend to be in the range of 1060 zones per edge and largely rectangular .",
    "the images are 32 mpc on a side ; note the unrefined region around the boundary of the figure .",
    "a side effect of the quasi - lagrangian refinement criterion coupled with the varying cell size is that the _ rms _ density fluctuations are roughly constant ( on a log basis ) throughout the hierarchy .",
    "this means that the gravitational force errors due to shot noise from the finite number of particles is roughly independant of density , rather than rising sharply in low density regions as in traditional high - resolution gravity schemes , such as p@xmath6 m and tree - codes .",
    "= 7.4 in    figure  [ fig : amr_profiles ] shows the baryonic and dark matter density profiles for this cluster . in order to gauge the convergence , results from three other amr runs are also plotted .",
    "these runs had smaller initial grids ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 ) and therefore poorer mass resolution and less initial power .",
    "we also plot the profile from navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the dark matter , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is set by the requirement that the mean density within the virial radius be 178 times the critical density . setting the parameter",
    "@xmath17 produces a remarkably good fit over three orders of magnitude .",
    "= 7.1 in    the gas density profile levels off at a few hundred kpc , around the knee in the dark matter profile .",
    "lower resolution results exhibit systematically lower densities , and although we have not converged , the difference between the @xmath7 initial grid and the higher - resolution run is slight .",
    "we remind the reader that this simulation does not include radiative cooling which would significantly affect the dynamics and structure of the inner few hundred kpc .",
    "the turnover in density agrees with that seen in entropy , shown in the same figure .",
    "there appears to be a cutoff in the entropy distribution , the cause of which is not currently understood .",
    "the amr algorithm is complementary to other simulation techniques , such as sph and eulerian single grid method .",
    "the advantage of amr is that it provides higher resolution than eulerian methods and better shock capturing features than sph codes .",
    "further , it is more flexible than lagrangian codes because we can control where the resolution is placed by changing the refinement criterion .",
    "also , since each level advances with its own timestep the entire computation does not have to proceed at the speed of its slowest component ( some sph codes also share this feature ) .",
    "the primary disadvantage is that the scheme is somewhat more complicated to code and modify ; this implementation uses a combination of c++ to handle the dynamic grid hierarchy and fortran 77 for computationally intensive tasks .",
    "here we have demonstrated that amr can model an x - ray cluster with many of the same desirable characteristics of the single - grid code but with much higher resolution .",
    "the efficiency of the amr method over a single grid for this simulation is quite high : a factor of 4000 in memory and 20 000 in cpu , although , of course , the resulting solution is not as good in low density regions .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with henry neeman and edmund bertschinger .",
    "this work is done under the auspices of the grand challenge cosmology consortium and supported in part by nsf grants asc-9318185 and nasa long term astrophysics grant nagw-3152 ."
