    "( i ) the dimensions of the trap are much larger than the ix bohr radius , which is @xmath17  nm in the structure , and the potential energy variation on the ix bohr radius is negligible in comparison to the ix binding energy , which is @xmath18  mev  @xcite .",

    "the capacitor formula provides a qualitative explanation for the observed increase of @xmath27 with photoexcitation power . however , analytical theory beyond the hartree approximation  @xcite and monte - carlo calculations  @xcite suggest that the capacitor formula significantly overestimates @xmath27 .",
    "the origin of this overestimation is the following .",
    "the repulsively interacting ixs avoid each other that lowers their interaction energy per particle as well as their energy shift compared with the uncorrelated state assumed in the hartree approximation .",
    "the correlations can be quantified by the dimensionless correlation parameter @xmath28 @xcite : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bare exciton density of states and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , are the effective masses of excitons , electrons , and holes , respectively .",
