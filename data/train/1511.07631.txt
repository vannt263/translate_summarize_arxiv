    "our finding of much reduced strain is also consistent with the much better electrical mobility in the pecvd - grown graphene , typically @xmath89 at 300 k , which is more than one order of magnitude better than that of thermal cvd - grown graphene .",
    "@xcite the availability of nearly strain - free graphene by means of our pecvd growth method clearly paves the way to strain - engineering of the electronic properties of graphene .",
    "having demonstrated the effect of strain on the electronic properties of graphene and our ability of developing nearly strain - free graphene , our next step is to employ theoretical simulations to assist our empirical designs of nanostructures on substrates in order to induce the desirable strain for graphene overlay on these substrates .",
    "we employed molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques to compute the spatial distributions of the displacement field , strain tensor and pseudo - magnetic field for given engineered nanoscale structural distortions to graphene . for simplicity , we chose either a nano - sphere or a nano - hemisphere with a varying radius as the building block for constructing different nanostructures on the substrate .      for the md simulations , we used the software package lammps , which is available on the website http://lammps.sandia.gov .",
    "we considered a monolayer squared - shape graphene sheet with a fixed number of monolayer carbon atoms , and assumed that the positions of the carbon atoms at the boundaries of this graphene sheet remained invariant throughout the simulations . to induce structural distortions , we moved the graphene sheet adiabatically towards either a nano - sphere or a nano - hemisphere of gold nanoparticle until a desirable maximum height @xmath90 relative to the boundaries of the graphene sheet was reached ( fig .",
    "5a - b ) , and then relaxed the entire system until it reached equilibrium . here the load necessary to move the graphene sheet towards the nanostructure was comparable to the combined effect of ambient air pressure and gravity .",
    "next , to ensure that the intrinsic properties of graphene were largely preserved without significant perturbations from the nanostructured substrate , we assumed that the attractive coupling between the graphene sheet and the underlying nanostructured substrate was sufficiently weak that it did not directly affect the graphene hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "the attractive interaction must also be sufficiently strong to ensure proper conformation of graphene to the nanostructured substrate .",
    "we found that this situation could be realized by inserting a monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) in - between the graphene sheet and the nanostructure / substrate , provided that the crystalline structure of the h - bn layer was aligned at an incommensurate angle relative to the graphene sheet so that no superlattice structures formed within the finite sheet of graphene under consideration .",
    "the rationale for the choice of h - bn for the substrate material was based on the empirical fact that graphene on h - bn exhibited as excellent electrical mobility and fractional quantum hall effects as those of suspended pristine graphene , in sharp contrast to substantially degraded mobility of graphene on other substrates ( such as sio@xmath91/si ) . therefore , we employed realistic parameters for the van der waals interaction of bn with carbon atoms and assumed isothermal conditions throughout the simulations described in section 3 .",
    "we also applied h - bn to all nanostructured substrates for empirical strain - engineering of graphene to be discussed in section 4 .",
    "based on the approach outlined above , we were able to locate the three - dimensional coordinates of all carbon atoms on the graphene sheet and determined the two - dimensional coordinates of the three - dimensional displacement fields ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) and the resulting strain tensor components ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) from eq .",

    "the orientation of the three - fold symmetry pattern coincides with the zigzag direction of the graphene lattice structure , suggesting that the alignment of the nanoscale structural distortions relative to the crystalline lattice of graphene is an important parameter in the strain engineering of graphene .",
    "we further note the large magnitude of @xmath50 values ( up to @xmath106 tesla , fig .",
    "5f ) , suggesting substantial modifications of the graphene electronic properties under such a nanostructure of comparable lateral and vertical dimensions .",
    "for comparison , if the maximum height @xmath90 is reduced from 2.4 nm to 1.2 nm , the maximum @xmath107 value decreases from @xmath106 to @xmath108 tesla , which is consistent with the strong dependence of the induced strain on the aspect ratio of the building block .      in order to better understand the effects of nanostructure alignment relative to the graphene crystalline lattice and the correlation of strain induced by separate nanostructures , we examined the spatial maps of @xmath50 due to two identical nanospheres and two identical nano - hemispheres aligned relative to either the zigzag or the armchair direction and under varying separations @xmath109 between the centers of the two nanoparticles . as shown in fig .",

    "monolayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) was then transferred onto the si - nanostructures , followed by the transfer of pecvd - graphene onto the substrate of bn / si - nanostructures .",
    "we performed afm and sem measurements on every step of the process , and found that bn conformed very well to the si - nanostructures , as exemplified by the afm image in fig .",
    "interestingly , upon the deposition of graphene on bn / si - nanostructures , we found that graphene appeared to wrinkle up slightly along the nanostructures , as exemplified by the afm image in fig .",
    "this situation is analogous to our findings from the md simulations , which revealed the appearance of graphene wrinkles along the alignment of its underlying nanostructures if the nanostructures were not too far apart .",

    "the raman spectrometer used a laser excitation of 532 nm with a spot size of about 500 nm . we mapped at 0.5 @xmath130 per pixel steps .",
    "each 2d - band spectrum was fit to a single lorentzian , and the frequency peak position was assigned as the corresponding 2d - band frequency . while the spatial resolution of the raman spectrometer at 0.5 @xmath130 was not sufficient to resolve the spatial distribution of strain associated with the individual nanodots , it appeared that the strain effects induced by the larger squared features could be resolved in some places .",
    "overall the spatial map of the 2d - band over the area of graphene above the nanostructures clearly revealed significant inhomogeneity ( fig .",
    "10a ) , which was in sharp contrast to the spatial homogeneity of the 2d - band map of a controlled area of graphene on top of a flat region of the bn / si substrate ( fig .",

    "the pixel size of the raman map is @xmath131 , which is insufficient to resolve the small nanostructures .",

    "however , it is generally very challenging to locate the small @xmath126 patterned area within a relatively large sample area , typically on the order of @xmath132 , under the atomically sharp stm tip . while this issue may be addressed by enlarging the total area of patterned nanostructures , another plausible approach was to distribute metallic nanoparticles over the entire substrate by means of self - assembly .",
    "this approach could enable quasi - periodic distributions of nanoparticles with a limited range of diameters .",
    "although not ideal for well controlled strain engineering , the use of self - assembled nanoparticles in place of either fib or electron - beam fabricated nanostructures could provide preliminary and semi - quantitative verifications for our theoretical designs , and so was worthy of exploration .    for this work , the self - assembled gold nanoparticles were developed from solutions on silicon substrates using block copolymer lithography ( bcpl )  @xcite .",
    "the preparation procedure is briefly summarized below .",
    "the solutions were mixed in a pyrex 5 ml micro volumetric flask that was specifically designed for microchemical work .",
    "the glassware was cleaned in aqua regia , rinsed in di water , followed by ultrasonication , and triple rinsed in di water followed by mild baking to remove any residual moisture .",

    "the solution was clear .",
    "the gold precursor was gold(iii ) chloride hydrate ( 99.999% trace metals basis aldrich , inc . ) , and 14.6 mg were added to the diblock copolymer solution under dry nitrogen and in a darkened environment .",
    "the solution was then stirred vigorously for l0 days to insure particle uniformity .",
    "the solution remained clear upon stirring , but the color changed to amber .",
    "the gold arrays were formed on mechanical grade silicon ( 5 x 5 ) mm without removing the native oxide .",
    "the silicon substrate was first blown with dry nitrogen to remove particulates and then subjected to a 100 w oxygen plasma ( technics inc .",

    "the substrate was loaded on a spin - coater and held in place with a vacuum chuck .",
    "the au - bcpl solution was dropped onto the silicon substrate so that the entire top surface was covered .",
    "the sample remained covered for 30 s before starting the spin process .",
    "samples were spun at 3000 rpm for 60 s. the substrate was removed from the spin - coater and placed in an oxygen plasma for 25 minutes at 100 w , and was subsequently removed from the plasma and baked overnight at 220 @xmath133c .    upon drying the solution and removing the polymer ,",
    "quasi - periodic gold nanoparticles of diameters ranging from 14 to 20 nm remained and covered the surface of the silicon substrate , with an average separation between adjacent nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 30 nm , as exemplified in fig .",

    "next , a monolayer bn was placed over the au - nanoparticles / silicon substrate , which was found to conform well to the nanoparticles , as shown in fig .",
    "finally , a monolayer pecvd - grown graphene was placed on top of the bn / au - nanoparticles / silicon , which induced wrinkles on graphene , as illustrated in fig .",
    "11c and similar to the findings in fig .  9c . in particular , we note a general preferential wrinkle alignment along approximately 150@xmath133 direction relative to the x - axis of the plot .",

    "12a the stm topography over a @xmath136 area revealed the protrusion of graphene above nanoparticle structures .",
    "close - up point spectroscopic studies around the nanoparticle structures ( fig .  12b , which corresponded to the lower left area of fig .",
    "12a ) indicated that in the highly strained regions where maximum changes in the graphene height appeared ( with @xmath137 nm descent over a lateral dimension @xmath138 nm ) , extra spectral features associated with the quantized density of states under a large pseudo - magnetic field appeared on top of the typical dirac spectrum , as exemplified in fig .  12c , where the excess quantized spectral features ( fig .  12d , after the subtraction of the dirac spectrum ) correspond to a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath139 tesla according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : en ] ) . in contrast , for relaxed regions of the graphene sample , the tunneling spectra recovered the standard dirac spectrum under finite thermal smearing ( fig .  12e ) .",

    "although the concept of nanoscale strain engineering of initially strain - free graphene samples has been verified semi - quantitatively based on the aforementioned studies , a number of challenges remain .",
    "first , as demonstrated by the md simulations , the pattern and strength of the pseudo - magnetic field depend strongly on the sizes , shapes , orientations and patterns of the nanostructures on the substrate for graphene .",
    "while modern technology for nano - fabrication could manage most of the requirements for the nanostructures , the necessity to align the graphene lattice with high accuracy in orientation relative to the nanostructures is a nontrivial task .",
    "second , any finite interactions between the substrate material and graphene would complicate the effect induced by generic structural distortions .",
    "while our insertion of a monolayer of bn between the substrate and graphene was intended to minimize the influence of the substrate and to preserve the generic properties of graphene , in the event of nearly perfect alignment of graphene with the underlying h - bn lattices , the dirac electrons of graphene could become gapped  @xcite so that the theoretical foundation for strain engineering of gapless dirac fermions would no longer hold .",
    "third , our md simulations have assumed perfectly local pseudo - magnetic fields in response to the local strain .",
    "this assumption is justifiable if the carrier density in the graphene sheet is sufficiently low so that electronic screening effects are negligible .",
    "on the other hand , doping effects of spatially inhomogeneous charged impurities could result in weakened pseudo - magnetic fields and broadened landau levels , which may account for the relatively broad linewidths observed in the tunneling spectra in fig",
    ".  12c .",
    "quantitatively , we may incorporate the non - local correction to the evaluation of an effective pseudo - magnetic field @xmath144 at position @xmath145 by following formula : @xmath146 where @xmath147 denotes the mean free path , and we have assumed that the x - range ( y - range ) of the sample expands from @xmath148 to @xmath149 ( from @xmath150 to @xmath151 ) . for a constant pseudo - field distribution over an infinite sample , we have @xmath152 everywhere within the sample as expected . on the other hand , a short mean free path @xmath147 would result in effective @xmath153 values significantly smaller than the local value of @xmath154 according to eq .",

    "we further remark that the relevant characteristic length involved in the non - local effect of pseudo - magnetic fields in eq .",
    "( 8) should be the mean free path @xmath147 rather than the pseudo - magnetic field length @xmath54 , because the contributions from the strain - induced gauge potential are only perturbative to the total hamiltonian of the dirac fermions , hence not all dirac fermions are completely localized to the length scale of @xmath54 by the presence of a pseudo - magnetic field , which is different from the situation for a global time - reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field .    for a given spatial distribution of @xmath155 ,",
    "if we define the deviation of the effective pseudo - magnetic field @xmath153 from its local value by @xmath156 , we find that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : en ] ) , the linewidth @xmath157 of the landau level energy @xmath49 becomes @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , the linewidth of @xmath49 increases with increasing non - local corrections to @xmath50 . on the other hand , for a given pseudo - magnetic field distribution",
    "we expect sharper landau levels at locations with larger @xmath50 values . ultimately , we expect much sharper conductance peaks for pseudo - magnetic fields induced on nearly impurity - free graphene by well ordered and well shaped nanostructures , and hope to verify this notion by further experimental investigation .",
    "finally , we note that the presence of pseudo - magnetic fields can lift the degeneracy of the two valleys , which could enable valleytronic applications . as exemplified in fig .",
    "13 , we can in principle detect the valley hall effect ( vhe ) in a design similar to that depicted for measurements of the vhe on the graphene / h - bn superlattice structure ,  @xcite except that we do not align the crystalline lattices of graphene and h - bn .",
    "rather , we would use a tetrahedron - shaped nanodot to split the valley currents and employ a backgate to tune the fermi level to the dirac point for maximum response .",
    "this design is equivalent to a valley field - effect - transistor enabled by the strain - induced topological currents .",
    "moreover , the ability to split the valley degeneracy into two paths with opposite chirality may be utilized in novel designs of either passive devices such as chiral electronics for detectors and light polarizers , or active devices such as tabletop free electron lasers with strain - induced , polarity - alternating pseudo - magnetic fields ( see , for example , fig .",
    "8b ) as the undulators for accelerating valley - polarized dirac fermions into synchrotron radiation .     and @xmath7-valleys , so that a transverse momentum can be provided to deflect electrical currents of opposite pseudo - spins to different directions over the strained area . therefore , in additional to the longitudinal resistance ( @xmath159 ) that can be determined from @xmath160 , a non - local resistance ( @xmath161 ) can be measured from @xmath162 as shown above , or equivalently from @xmath163 . by placing the graphene hall bar on the h - bn / sio@xmath91/si substrate and attaching a back gate to the si , the fermi level of the graphene can be controlled relative to the dirac point by tuning the gate voltage ( @xmath164 ) so that a sharp peak in @xmath161-vs.-@xmath164 is expected when the fermi level coincides with the dirac point .",
    "@xcite this configuration is therefore a field effect transistor .",
    "we remark that the distance between cg and bf must be less than the mean free path @xmath165 to ensure optimized valley splitting if only one tetrahedron - shaped nanostructure is constructed . in the event of smaller @xmath165 values , multiple tetrahedron - shaped nanostructures that space @xmath166 apart from each other",
    "may be aligned between cg and bf to prolong the spatial extent of the valley splitting effects.,width=326 ]",
    "we have reviewed in this work the theoretical foundation for nanoscale strain engineering of graphene , and have demonstrated the use of molecular dynamics techniques for designing various nanostructures to realize different patterns of pseudo - magnetic fields .",
    "we have also presented experimental evidences for strain - induced charging effects and giant pseudo - magnetic fields , and described feasible empirical approaches based on nano - fabrication techniques to realizing strain - engineering of pseudo - magnetic fields and valleytronics .    while the nanoscale strain engineering effects may be determined by stm , we emphasize that useful designs must ensure that the strain effects are extended to mesoscopic and even macroscopic scales for realistic device applications .",
    "hence , the use of theoretical simulations ( such as the molecular dynamics techniques ) to assist the design of collective nanostructures for desirable strain distributions and device performance can greatly improve the effectiveness of experimental implementations .",
    "finally , we remark that the feasibility of nanoscale strain - engineering and valleytronics in graphene is based on the unique electronic properties of this novel nano - material and the availability of modern nanotechnology . with due ingenuity ,",
    "imagination and diligence , the interesting interplay of structural , electronic and topological properties of nano- and meta - materials is likely to open up new frontiers in scientific and technological exploration that have not been envisioned before .",
