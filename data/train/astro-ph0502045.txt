    "when modeling the transfer of radiation through optically thick material , it is often useful to use pretabulated mean opacity tables , because performing computationally costly calculations of the frequency dependent opacity may not be feasible .",
    "there are many relevant applications in astrophysics for using mean opacities including the interiors of cool stars , giant planets , and disks of material forming stars and planets .",
    "recent opacity tables useful for modeling stellar interiors and envelopes come from two major sources , the opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers ( 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ) , rogers & iglesias ( 1992a , 1992b ) and @xcite)and the opacity project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* op hereafter ) .",
    "the opacities from these two groups match very well at most temperatures , and their results have been used to resolve several discrepancies between theoretical models and observations including evolutionary models of high - mass stars ( @xcite ) , intepretations of the hr diagram ( @xcite ) and radiative acceleration in stellar envelopes ( @xcite ) .",
    "each of the above opacity databases are valid for temperatures greater than 6000  k , but do not include the effects of molecules which become important at lower temperatures .    in cool gases molecules become dominating sources of opacity and must be included in compilations of rosseland opacity tables .",
    "@xcite first included the effects of molecular absorbers such as h@xmath0o , co , and oh . the wichita state university ( wsu ) low temperature opacity group began publishing tables of opacities for temperatures below 10000  k in 1975 .",
    "@xcite computed opacities down to 700  k and included a crude estimate of the opacity due to dust grains . a better approximation to",
    "the dust opacity was included in @xcite and alexander & ferguson ( 1994a , 1994b ; af94 hereafter ) .",
    "@xcite focused on molecular opacities and their application to accrection disks .",
    "opacity tables for use in protoplanetary disk models were computed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s03 hereafter ) for for gas and dust mixtures from 10  k to 10000  k.    table  1 illustrates the improvement in the wsu opacity calculations beginning in 1975 through the present .",
    "current opacities are computed with a modified version of the stellar atmosphere code phoenix .",
    "each of the changes indicated in the table will be discussed in one of the following sections starting with the equation of state followed by sources of opacity data . in section  4",
    "current opacities will be compared with af94 , op , opal , and s03 . section  5 focuses on the computation of planck mean opacity values",
    ". methods of obtaining the new wsu opacity tables for the current set of compositions is described in section  6 as well as how to request new or customized opacity tables .",
    "as shown in table  1 one of the most significant differences between the opacity tables of af94 and current tables is within the equation of state ( eos hereafter ) . in af94 , only six grain species were included and their number densities were taken from pre - tabulated functions ( precentage of grain material condensed ) of temperature and pressure provided by sharp ( private communication ) .",
    "consequently , af94 used two decoupled equations of state , one for gas with grains and one for pure gas .",
    "while this procedure is reasonably accurate for compositions close to those provided to af94 by sharp ( all of which have @xmath5 ( hydrogen ) and @xmath6 ( metal ) abundances close to solar with differing c / o ratios ) , it becomes increasingly imprecise for compositions that deviate significantly from the solar mixture .",
    "tests show that for nearly solar values of x the number abundances of grains in af94 are consistent with the current work , however for a hydrogen poor gas differences do occur on the order of 20 times less grain material in af94 .",
    "the resulting mean opacity will subsequently be low by that factor , see below for a discussion of the mean opacity calculation .",
    "the current eos contained in the phoenix stellar atmosphere code most recently described in @xcite contains several hundred molecules and dozens of solid and liquid species in chemical equilbrium .",
    "the new eos represents a significant advance in the calculation of low temperature molecular and grain opacities when compared to af94 .",
    "the eos of phoenix is able to calculate the chemical equilibrium of 40 elements , including the ionization stages indicated in table  2 , along with the molecular and solid and liquid species for hundreds of species . for the discussion in this paper we focus on molecular and solid phase species , since liquids do not become abundant enough to affect the mean opacity .",
    "figure  1 shows the abundances of condensates as a function of temperature for a single gas pressure of 1  dyne  @xmath7 and a solar composition from @xcite .",
    "several species have had their abundances summed for clarity .",
    "the silicate species mgsio@xmath1 , mg@xmath0sio@xmath8 , and fe@xmath0sio@xmath8 are combined with the minor species na@xmath0sio@xmath1 to make up the `` silicates '' group .",
    "the `` fe '' group contains both fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath10 crystal structures .",
    "the four crystal structures of al@xmath0o@xmath1@xmath11 form the `` al@xmath0o@xmath1 '' group . the `` titanates '' group contains catio@xmath1 , mgtio@xmath1 and mgti@xmath0o@xmath12 .",
    "the `` ca - silicates '' contains camgsi@xmath0o@xmath13 , ca@xmath0al@xmath0sio@xmath14 and ca@xmath0mgsi@xmath0o@xmath14 .",
    "the `` al - silicates '' group contains al@xmath13si@xmath0o@xmath15 , al@xmath0sio@xmath12 , kalsi@xmath1o@xmath16 and naalsi@xmath1o@xmath16 .",
    "the choice of each of the groups is arbitrary and is done only to make the figure more readable ; such grouping is not done in the eos or the opacity calculations of phoenix .",
    "figure  1 demonstrates the complicated nature of the equation of state for a cool gas . the first condensate to condense at the pressure shown in fig",
    ".  1 is al@xmath0o@xmath1 at about 1550  k ( although zro@xmath0 condenses at a higher temperature its abundance is not large enough to be shown in the figure ) .",
    "below 1400  k al@xmath0o@xmath1 disappears in favor of the `` ca - silicates '' group ( which does contain a small amount of al ) and the `` titanates '' . just at and below 1200",
    "k `` silicates '' and the `` fe '' condensates form and dominate the abundance of grain material .",
    "the mean opacity of such a gas - grain mixture is discussed in section  4 .",
    "the interplay between solid species and gas - phase chemistry is illustrated by focusing on abundant titanium species in figure  2 .",
    "two separate calculations of the eos are shown in the figure , one with grains and one without ( `` nog '' in the figure ) .",
    "both calculations assume solar abundances and a gas pressure of 1  dyne  @xmath7 .",
    "when condensation is included in the eos the abundances of the molecular species are greatly reduced in favor of solid species .",
    "for example , molecular tio , which is an important absorber in cool stellar atmospheres disappears when grains are included in the eos . this removal will have a large impact on the opacity of the gas .",
    "the effect of removing an important species such as titanium via ( for example ) gravitational settling ( see @xcite and @xcite ) of solid particles can greatly affect the opacity .",
    "figure  3 shows a contour plot of the relative number abundance ( the ratio of the amount of a particular species to the total gas density ) of several species as functions of gas temperature and pressure .",
    "1 represents a slice at @xmath17 in fig .",
    "3 . for clarity , each contour in fig .",
    "3 represents a single value of @xmath18 for each species , and has a different value for each species .",
    "the contour values shown are for al@xmath0o@xmath1 ( all four forms of al@xmath0o@xmath1 are included ) for which the value is -6.2 ; for catio@xmath1 the value is -7.0 ; for mgal@xmath0o@xmath8 , -6.0 ; mgsio@xmath1 , -5.0 ; fe , -4.7 ; and fes is -5.0 .",
    "the species with the highest condensation temperature at @xmath17 , al@xmath0o@xmath1 , forms a ridge peaking along a line on @xmath19 to 3.3 from low to high gas pressure .",
    "note that at the very highest pressures the first condensate to form appears to be solid mgal@xmath0o@xmath8 .",
    "however , because only a single contour value for each species is shown it appears as if al@xmath0o@xmath1 does not exist at the highest pressures .",
    "this is artificial ; al@xmath0o@xmath1 still exists , but its abundance has fallen below the value of the contour shown . the species catio@xmath1 and mgal@xmath0o@xmath8 also form ridges in the @xmath20plane , but very little mgal@xmath0o@xmath8 forms at low pressures .",
    "both mgsio@xmath1 and fe condense on very broad plateaus : for example , fe forms at temperatures lower than @xmath21 at low pressures all the way up to @xmath22 at the highest pressures .",
    "however , for the condensation sequence shown here the amount of solid fe is reduced at @xmath23 in favor of solid fes .    a contour plot such as the one shown in fig .",
    "3 is important in understanding how the opacity changes with changes in gas temperature and pressure . as the gas - grain mixture turns from gas",
    "dominated to grain dominated the mean opacity changes dramatically : once grains `` turn on '' the mean opacity will also depend upon which grain exists and which do not .",
    "the following sections will discussion this relationship between the eos and the opacity .",
    "in the following sections we include a discussion of the sources of data for each type of opacity included in our calculations .",
    "discussion of parameters in this section are based upon mean opacity tables computed for solar compositions with @xmath24 and from @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gas density and temperature is in millions of kelvin .",
    "the details of the calculation of the full table of rosseland mean opacities is described in section  4 below .",
    "monochromatic opacities are used to compute the rosseland mean ( @xmath29 ) by :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the monochromatic opacity described in this section , @xmath32 is the planck function and @xmath33 is therefore the weighting function of the rosseland mean . for the computations discussed here we integrate eq .  1 over 24,000 wavelengths .",
    "these wavelengths are not evenly spaced , and are concentrated between 0.1 and 2.0  @xmath34 : from 10 to 1000   we have points every 10  ; from 1000 to 20000   , every 2   ; from 20000 to 50000   , every 5   ; from 5  @xmath34 to 50  @xmath34 , every 100   ; and from 50  @xmath34 to 500  @xmath34 , points are spaced every 0.1  @xmath34 .",
    "the wavelength points are adjustable and several tests have been made to ensure convergence .",
    "for example , doubling the number of points increases the computation time by about a factor of two without significantly changing the total rosseland mean opacity .",
    "note that this is not the case for planck mean opacities discussed in section  5 .",
    "descriptions of the continuous opacity sources used in phoenix are found in @xcite . to be complete",
    "we list a few of the important sources here . for h ,",
    "he and heavy elemental ( c , n , o , ca , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 atomic processes we use the cross - sections of @xcite . for the other light elements we use the cross - sections of @xcite .",
    "the analytic fits of @xcite are also included in phoenix , but they are only significant at very high temperatures , beyond those discussed here",
    ".    the negative ions of a few elements can be large sources of @xmath35 and @xmath36 opacity . for h@xmath37 opacity",
    "we use @xcite and for he@xmath37 we use a function from @xcite which has been modified to reproduce the cross - sections from @xcite . for h@xmath38",
    "we use a formula from @xcite .",
    "h@xmath39 among other quasi - molecular hydrogen opacity sources are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "c@xmath37 opacities are from @xcite .",
    "table  2 shows the major atomic neutral and ionic species with strong spectal lines included in the work presented here .",
    "we include 40 atomic species and their ions in our calculations .",
    "minor species such as li , be , and b among others are included in the eos , but are are not shown in the table since their low abundance and low number of lines do not affect mean opacities significantly .",
    "since we focus on mean opacities calculated for temperatures less than 30000  k we do not include in our calculations ions beyond the 5th ionized stage for any element , but phoenix does have the capability to compute the opacity due to ions with higher ionized stages .",
    "most of the line data is taken from @xcite , with small adjustments for minor species .    often in model calculations",
    "it is convenient to discard weak lines to save computation time .",
    "the line selection process of phoenix is described in @xcite , but for opacity tables computed by our group we include all atomic lines listed in table  2 ( plus weaker lines not shown in the table ) with lines at line center having a line opacity larger than the opacity in the continuum as voigt profiles . for lines weaker than the continuum we assume doppler profiles .",
    "@xcite contains a discussion of the details of this calculation .",
    "sources for the list of molecular lines used in phoenix are described in table  3 for many individual molecular sources and in table  4 for molecular line data from the hitran database from @xcite and @xcite . as in the computation of the opacity due to atomic lines ,",
    "all molecular lines listed are read into phoenix ; that is no line selection process is used .",
    "all molecular lines are assumed to have doppler profiles since the number of molecular lines per wavelength interval is very large and no molecular lines are strong enough to have significant wings .",
    "as for the atomic lines @xcite and @xcite contain discussions of the details of the calculation .    water vapor opacity is a very strong source of opacity from about 1800  k to 2500  k. as outlined in table  3 phoenix has the ability to include three different water opacity sources .",
    "the earlier work of af94 used the molecular line data from @xcite and @xcite for molecular water but this data is not available in our current code .",
    "for the opacities computed for this paper we have chosen to use the molecular line data from @xcite commonly used by various authors including @xcite .",
    "this list has been shown by @xcite to provide a more complete description of the near - infrared spectra of brown dwarfs .",
    "collision - induced absorption ( cia ) opacities are taken from data provided by the borysow group . a detailed list of the references for the cia opacities can be found in @xcite and @xcite .      just as is the case for molecules ,",
    "the computation of the opacity due to small solid dust particles requires a knowledge of the abundance of the particles as a function of temperature and pressure and the absorption and scattering properties of each particle .",
    "the opacity due to a dust species can be computed from    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the normalized number of dust particles of species _",
    "i _ of size _ a _ and @xmath42 is the total extinction ( absorption plus scattering ) efficiency of the particle .",
    "the size distribution , @xmath41 depends upon both the number abundance of species _",
    "i _ and the size distribution of dust particles . here",
    "the size distribution of dust particles is assumed to be that found for particles in the interstellar medium by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , mrn ) also assumed by af94 .",
    "the choice of size distribution is somewhat model dependent and different distributions will change the resulting mean opacities . while an interstellar size distribution does not necessarily apply in other physical circumstances , it has been adopted as a standard by most investigators .",
    "tables based upon other size distributions will be computed upon request . for a good review of modern size distributions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the extinction efficiencies of the particles is computed according to mie theory for solid spheres composed of a single , pure substance .",
    "future work will also explore the effect of different size distributions , aggregrate grains , shape , and porosity on the mean opacity of gas - grain mixtures .",
    "table 5 lists the grain species included in our eos and for which we have optical data available .",
    "an excellent reference to an online database is found in @xcite .",
    "the table gives each condensate by chemical formula , the source of the thermodynamic data , source of the optical constants and the wavelength range for which the optical data is valid .",
    "the last column in the table indicates if the data for the condensate is from an analog species .",
    "for example , optical constant data for mgtio@xmath1 is not available , but mgtio@xmath1 exists in the eos and has a significant abundance for a narrow range of temperatures ( see fig .",
    "optical data for catio@xmath1 is available and can be used as an analog species for mgtio@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in whether catio@xmath1 is a good analog for mgtio@xmath1 is much smaller than the error in including mgtio@xmath1 in the eos with no opacity from that species",
    ".    for the computation of the rosseland mean opacity , missing optical constant data over specific wavelength ranges will dramatically affect the resulting mean opacity due to the inverse nature of the rosseland mean ( see fig .",
    "16 of af94 ) .",
    "often optical data is not available over the entire wavelength range that we integrate to compute the rosseland mean . to avoid these problems we interpolate or extrapolate data so that the optical constant data covers the wavelength range from @xmath43",
    "care is taken in the extrapolation to follow trends in similar condensate species .",
    "for example , optical data for ca@xmath0al@xmath0sio@xmath14 is extrapolated into the visual part of the spectrum by using mgsio@xmath1 and mg@xmath0sio@xmath8 for comparison since all three species are silicate in nature and the far - infrared optical constants are similar in shape . while such extrapolations undoubtedly introduce uncertainties , however , the fact that the rosseland mean weighting function is so small at short wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "4f ) these uncertainties are minor .",
    "we stress that ca@xmath0al@xmath0sio@xmath14 can be an important condensate at intermediate temperatures ( see fig .  1 ) and",
    "should not be removed from the mean opacity calculation .",
    "monochromatic opacities of important absorbers are shown in figure  4 for a range of gas temperature , a constant value of @xmath44 and solar abundances .",
    "the important opacity contributors are indicated in each plot .",
    "the monochromatic opacities in each panel of the figure have been smoothed by convolving the monochromatic output of phoenix with a gaussian .",
    "the width of the gaussian varies with wavelength in order to show detail at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the wavelength range chosen is based upon the value of the weighting function ( @xmath45 ) ; each plot is shown where the weighting function has a value greater than 0.1% of the maximum .",
    "as the temperature of the gas is decreased the wavelength maxima of the weighting function moves towards longer wavelengths as defined by @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noted that the smoothing was only done in preparing these figures and is not done in the computation of the mean opacity .    in figure  4a , at 10000  k , the frequency dependent opacity is dominated by hydrogen @xmath35 and @xmath36 absorption with a significant contribution from atomic line absorbers ( labeled `` metals '' in the figure ) appearing at short wavelength ( typically @xmath47   ) .",
    "the atomic line sources become even more important at shorter wavelengths , but the value of the weighting function is rapidly decreasing .    at 5000  k ( panel  b ) the contribution of atomic lines increases significantly relative to the total opacity , while the opacity due to neutral hydrogen is diminished . at wavelengths",
    "longer than 0.5  @xmath48 m h@xmath37 is the dominant continuous opacity souce , but is not shown in panel  ( a ) because it is not important at 10000  k. the contribution from molecular sources of opacity are not shown in panel  ( b ) for clarity , but are included in the total opacity .",
    "the bump in the total opacity at 4.5  @xmath48 m is due to co gas , a molecule with high chemical stability .    in panel  ( c ) of fig .  4 at 2000  k the monochromatic opacity is beginning to be dominated by molecular absorbers . in the panel ,",

    ", tio is the most significant contributer with co being important at 4.5  @xmath48 m .",
    "water opacity is the dominant source of opacity over the broad range of wavelengths shown in the panel . at 2000",
    "k atomic metals are important below 4000   , but are not important to the total mean opacity due to the sharp decrease in the weighting function .    at lower temperatures grains begin to become the dominant opacity source .",
    "4d was chosen with a gas temperature of 1450  k ( logarithm value 3.16 ) correlating to the peak of the al@xmath0o@xmath1 abundance shown in fig .  1 .",
    "4d shows how important a contribution al@xmath0o@xmath1 can make . at many wavelengths al@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "is the strongest continuous contributor to the opacity with molecular sources adding a `` forest '' of lines on top of the dust source .",
    "molecular sources still have a large role in the total opacity with tio peaking at wavelengths shortward of 1.2  @xmath48 m and h@xmath0o contributing at infrared wavelengths .    at 1000",
    "k the the most abundant grains are the silicates and iron ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "4e shows how important grain sources of opacity can be to the total .",
    "fig .  4f , with a gas temperature of 500  k ,",
    "is shown indicating the strength of the individual contributors : solid fe , fes , and silicate grains ( for this figure the species mgsio@xmath1 , mg@xmath0sio@xmath8 , and fe@xmath0sio@xmath8 are included as `` silicates '' ) .      shown in figure  5 is the mean opacity from this work compared with opal and af94 for the pure hydrogen case for @xmath49 ; pure hydrogen opacities are not available from op .",
    "results are generally quite good , with differences between opal and this work being 0.02 dex for the temperatures shown in the plots for low @xmath50 values . for the larger @xmath51 values the difference is as large as 0.05 dex or 12% . when we remove opacity sources from our calculations including all molecular hydrogen species ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath38 , etc",
    ". ) and quasi - molecular hydrogen opacity ,",
    "then mean opacities at the higher @xmath51 values compare much better with opal .",
    "the rise in our opacity at lower temperatures ( about 5600  k ) is due to our inclusion of molecular hydrogen which is not included in opal .",
    "a comparison between opal , op , and af94 with present calculations for the pure helium case are shown in figure  6a .",
    "again the values of @xmath51 are indicated in each panel .",
    "a large difference is apparent between @xmath52 where the mean opacity from this paper is much higher than either af94 and opal .",
    "the cause of this effect is our inclusion of neutral helium absorption lines which are not included by opal , op , or af94 .",
    "6b shows this effect with the same ratios as fig .",
    "6a , but without neutral he lines included in the computation .",
    "notice that the scale of the figure is different than in fig .",
    "5 . at mid - range temperatures the opacity differences are similar in absolute magnitude to the pure hydrogen case .",
    "figure  7 presents the results for a hydrogen and helium mixture , specifically @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as in the pure hydrogen and the pure helium mixtures the comparisions are good .",
    "differences between our opacities and those from opal are within 0.03 dex from @xmath55 for low @xmath51 values . comparing with op ,",
    "differences are as large as 0.07 dex in the same temperature range .",
    "this indicates conflicting results between opal and op ( see the recent paper by seaton & badnell 2004 ) .",
    "differences increase at lower temperatures as molecular hydrogen becomes important in our opacity calculations ( see the discussion above for a pure hydrogen case ) .      shown in figure  8 are comparisons for the solar metallicity case @xmath53 and @xmath56 for the same @xmath51 values used in previous figures .",
    "again , differences are generally less than 0.05 in the logarithm of the mean opacity for @xmath57 values larger than 4.1 . at lower temperatures",
    "the effects of molecules on the equation of state begin to become important .",
    "figure  9 shows the rosseland mean opacity for solar abundances ( x=0.7 , z=0.02 based upon @xcite ) , temperatures from 500  k to 10000  k , and for @xmath58 .",
    "opacities from op , opal and s03 are also shown in the plot .",
    "the features seen in the figure come from the physics discussed in figures  1 ( the eos ) and 4 ( monochromatic opacity ) and the regions where grains , molecules , and atoms dominate the opacity are also indicated in the figure . at high temperatures",
    "atomic line and continous opacities dominate the rosseland mean which falls towards cooler gas temperatures as the atoms become more neutral .",
    "a bump is seen at @xmath59 where molecules begin to become important .",
    "the sharp rise seen to the left of @xmath60 is due to the formation of molecular h@xmath0o and tio ( see fig .",
    "the bump peaks at @xmath61 and begins to fall again due to decreased population of excited levels in molecules .",
    "grains appear at @xmath62 ( at this gas pressure ) as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for different gas pressures the appearance temperature of grains will move cooler at low pressure and move warmer at higher pressures as shown in fig .",
    "the appearance or disappearance of various grain species account for the rise and fall of the mean opacity towards cooler temperatures in fig .",
    "many of the individual features will be discussed in detail below .",
    "several differences between the sets of opacities are readily apparent , the largest being at low temperature with some minor differences in the region dominated by atomic opacities . at higher temperatures af94 ,",
    "op , opal and the current work are not resolved in the figure , however , mean opacities from s03 are seen to be somewhat lower than the others .",
    "8 shows that differences between af94 , op and opal are all less than 0.05 in the logarithm .",
    "the difference between the current work and s03 is 0.17 dex at @xmath63 , or nearly 50% lower in value .",
    "second , the effect of the absence of molecules in the op calculation becomes apparent around @xmath64 .",
    "the dominant opacity source from @xmath65to@xmath66 is line opacity from molecular water and tio .",
    "third , the onset of grain formation , seen at @xmath67 in fig .  9 , occurs at a lower temperature in af94 , and even lower in s03 .",
    "this difference is the result of the more complete gas / grain eos included in the present work while , as already mentioned , af94 only included six grain species in the eos .",
    "also both af94 and s03 do not include high temperature condensates such as al@xmath0o@xmath1 . in trial computations where the higher temperature condensates were not included ,",
    "the trend shown by s03 was well matched .",
    "another small factor in the differences between this work and s03 is the use of condensation temperature instead of evaporation temperature . in a physical circumstance where the temperature is time - dependent",
    ", these two temperatures do not have the same value due to a hysteresis - like effect : the evaporation of grain material occurs at a temperature lower than the condensation temperature , as discussed by s03 .    a difference of greater concern in fig .",
    "9 is the magnitude of the rosseland mean opacity at low temperatures when comparing with af94 . at @xmath68 af94",
    "has a rosseland mean opacity that is about half a dex greater than present calculations .",
    "there are several reasons for this large difference .",
    "first , the computations of af94 utilized a crude eos ( only six grains species and decoupled grain and gas number densities ) and do not match the number abundances of the current eos .",
    "second , af94 used the continuous distribution of ellipsoids ( cde ) for computation of the grain opacity which produces a greater total opacity from a fixed amount of grain material .",
    "third , af94 used optical constants from @xcite for ( dirty ) astronomical silicates while the current data set is outlined in table  5 .",
    "when we change the input optical constant data for silicates in phoenix to match that of af94 we come much closer to repeating the results of af94 .",
    "since the eos of phoenix computes the amount of individual species of pure enstatite , forsterite , and fayalite we use the optical constants for those pure solids and try not to mix in `` astronomical silicates '' or use data for olivine ( ( mg , fe)@xmath0sio@xmath8 ) .    comparing present opacities with s03 presents challenges as well .",
    "the s03 paper includes a variety of models for dust parameters and for fig .",
    "9 we used the s03 model that best fit the assumptions of our current calculations , including that grains are homogenous spheres with a normal iron content .",
    "other differences between this work and s03 are due to differences in the optical constant data used , different eos methods , and different grain size distributions",
    ".    the importance of the various grain opacity contributors is demonstrated in figure  10 . in the figure",
    "the partial rosseland mean opacity is shown : that is , the total opacity is computed excluding one species at a time is plotted .",
    "it is important to point out that in both panels of fig .",
    "10 the opacity source is removed , but each species still exists in the eos .",
    "removing the species from the eos can introduce drastic changes to the abundances of other species and effect the mean opacity in non - linear ways .    in fig .",
    "10a there are only three dominant opacity sources shown .",
    "hydrogen contributes the most at temperatures above 5000  k. for temperatures less than about 10000  k the continuous opacity due to the h@xmath37 molecule is very important , while below 5000  k molecular sources dominate the mean opacity .    lower temperature partial opacities",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "again the solid line is the mean opacity with all species , the dash - dot line removes all molecules from the opacity , the dashed line removes only water opacity and the dotted line ( only for log t larger than 3.2 ) removes the contribution of molecular tio . notice that removing molecular sources changes the mean opacity by more than a factor of 1000 at @xmath69 . at even lower temperatures removing all grain species ( see the dash - dot - dot - dot line in fig .",
    "10b ) from the opacity has a dramatic effect on the mean opacity , for example at @xmath70 the difference is more than six orders of magnitude . in fig .",
    "10b the dotted line ( below @xmath71 ) is the opacity without silicate grain sources , and the long dashed line is the opacity without condensed iron .",
    "figure  11 shows the effect on the opacity due to changes in metallicity . for @xmath72 changes in the amount of metals as a function of z",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "11a and changes with amount of hydrogen ( x ) are shown in fig .",
    "for the variable z case , notice that not only is the total opacity diminished as the amount of metals is reduced , but that condensation temperatures are also reduced since there are less metals available for grains to exist in equilibrium . for z=.1 the onset of grains occurs at about @xmath73 , but for a highly reduced metallicity , z=.0001 , the onset occurs at about @xmath74 , more than 300  k cooler than the higher z value . even though the amount of metals has been reduced by three orders of the magnitude at these gas temperatures the amount of the rosseland opacity has been reduced by more than four orders of magnitude .",
    "when grains exist they are a powerful opacity source .    in fig .",
    "11b with constant z and variable x the grain formation temperatures are about the same since hydrogen is in such great abundance and does not play a role in the grain chemistry .",
    "the amount of opacity seen at the higher temperatures is greatly affected however , as the hydrogen fraction is reduced and the abundance of helium is raised especially at x=.1 and helium lines dominate the opacity at gas temperatures larger than 15000  k. the molecular bump seen at @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "9 ) is slightly reduced as is the rise due to molecular h@xmath0o at @xmath60 since there is less hydrogen available .",
    "the rises in the opacity due to condensates is slightly affected with the formation temperatures ( @xmath75 ) being slightly higher with less hydrogen to form water .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is often used in the limit where the diffusion approximation is a valid description of the physical conditions of a gas , typically in optically thick regions . in optically thin regions",
    "the diffusion approximation may not be a valid approximation .",
    "in such cases the planck mean opacity ( @xmath76 ) can be used to represent the mean opacity and is defined as    @xmath77    where variables are defined as in eq .  1 .",
    "the main difference between a rosseland and planck mean opacity is the way in which the monochromatic opacity is averaged . in the case of a rosseland mean",
    ", the inverse of the opacity , multiplied by @xmath78 , is summed making the total mean a harmonic mean , that is , the mean heavily weights wavelengths of low opacity , such as gaps between lines . for the planck mean the monochromatic opacities , multiplied by the planck function , are summed directly , so that the total mean planck opacity is a representation of the opaqueness of the gas rather than its transparency .",
    "figure  12 shows a comparison between our calculations and a representation of calculations from the literature ( including op , s03 , and @xcite ) .",
    "note that the figure is for a single gas density of 10@xmath79  g  @xmath3 and not in @xmath51 space .",
    "also included in fig .",
    "12 is a phoenix computation with more than one million wavelength points , more than 40 times the normal wavelength set as defined in section  3 .",
    "the normal wavelength set of 24,600 wavelengths is not sufficient to match the computation from op .",
    "it is the opacity sampling method of atomic lines ( and molecular lines at lower temperatures ) employed in our calculation that causes this defficiency .",
    "this effect is fully expected due to the way in which op computes the planck mean opacity ; they essentially sum the oscillator strengths for each line ( seaton , private communication ) removing the uncertainty of line profile shape and wing cutoffs",
    ".    what is puzzling about fig .",
    "12 is the nearly five order of magnitude difference between the planck opacities of op and s03 at high temperatures where atomic line sources dominate the mean opacity . at low temperatures when the opacity of the gas is dominated by continuous dust sources the results are very similar .",
    "af94 opacities are high due to the use of the cde for the calculation of the grain opacity",
    ". we can account for differences at high temperature between our work , af94 and op because of our use of opacity sampling for line opacities and the number of wavelengths points used .",
    "it is speculated that s03 and @xcite are different from the current work due to differences in the molecular line lists used , eos and number of wavelengths over which the mean opacity is integrated .",
    "the final point we wish to make is that users of af94 planck opacities need to strongly consider using our newer planck opacities computed with over one million wavelength points .",
    "the newer calculations nicely overlap with op at higher temperatures and we are confident of their validity as shown in fig .  12 .",
    "many updates have been made to the previous wsu low temperature opacity tables .",
    "af94 was only valid below 12000  k , while current tables are valid up to 30000  k and there is better agreement with op and opal at high temperatures than af94 .",
    "the present work includes many more wavelength points in the calculation of the mean opacity and includes a greater number of molecular lines for most sources than af94 , most of which are based upon improved laboratory observations and quantum mechanical calculations . for dust species , the eos of the dust is now fully coupled to the gas .",
    "many more dust species are also included in the current work .",
