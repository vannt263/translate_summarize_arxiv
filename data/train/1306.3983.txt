    "here , we describe additional tests carried out in order to estimate the degree to which our dm limits might vary under alternative assumptions pertaining to the astrophysical background and cosmic ray propagation . in addition , we quantify the significance of spectral features in the observed positron fraction .         in deriving our main results , as shown in fig .  3",

    "in the _ right panel _ , we repeat this exercise , but replace the ams background parametrization with physically motivated models for the primary @xmath94 , secondary @xmath2 , and pulsar originated @xmath2 fluxes ( see discussion in the main text ) , calculated with the same galactic propagation model as used in determining the spectrum of cr leptons from dm . in this case , our results can be further altered by a factor of up to @xmath03 .",
    "the reason for this change is that our physically motivated models describe the individual components by power - laws with breaks at a few gev .",
    "these spectral features in the background can be the result of different energy loss mechanisms kicking in , energy losses due to bremsstrahlung emission , dominant at lower energies , equal locally those due to synchrotron radiation and ics ( dominant at higher energies ) . since the energy loss rate @xmath95 due to bremsstrahlung radiation scales as @xmath96 while the @xmath95 due to synchrotron and ics as @xmath97 ( at the thompson cross - section regime ) , a spectral change in the propagated @xmath2 around that energy is expected ( see , e.g. , ref ",
    "@xcite ) . ] or from individual local and recent supernovae affecting the high energy @xmath94 spectrum . also , observations at microwave and radio frequencies suggest a different spectral power - law for the cr @xmath2 at @xmath01gev @xcite compared to cr @xmath2 flux measurements at higher energies @xcite .",
    "while changes in the spectral power - law describing these components are motivated by the reasons just described , sharp breaks used to implement them are theoretically less accurate and fit slightly worse the ams positron fraction spectrum .",
    "in addition , our physically motivated models include the impact of solar modulation by using the force field approximation .",
    "solar modulation modifies the position and normalization of the dark matter signal flux , but is negligible at energies @xmath985gev .",
    "we do not expect solar modulation to significantly smoothen a sharp spectral peak at higher energies .    given",
    "that we consider a population of pulsars as one possible source of the rising positron fraction above 10gev ( with tev - scale dm or a single dominant pulsar being alternative possibilities ) , we will briefly discuss the impact of their modeling on our limits . for pulsars that eventually inject equal amounts of @xmath2 into the ism",
    ", their injection spectra can be estimated from gamma - ray and synchrotron observations towards known pulsars , such as the crab .",
    "also get further accelerated at the termination shock between the magnetosphere and the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , and the @xmath2 injected to the ism are dominantly coming from middle aged pulsars after their respective pwn have been disrupted ( see refs .",

    "final states , obtained by adopting the power - law background model .",
    "the _ gray lines _ , in contrast , show limits obtained when the contribution from many pulsars is taken into account ( for 15 different realizations ) . ]    in addition , as suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite , the total contribution from many pulsars ",
    "each with a different age , distance , initial rotational energy , injected energy into @xmath2 , and unique environmental surroundings affecting energy losses and diffusion  is expected to give a spectrum with many peaks and dips , especially at higher energies where fewer pulsars significantly contribute . with fine enough energy resolution and high statistics",
    ", one should be able to observe such spectral features . by using the data from the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite and implementing the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , we ran multiple realizations of such combined spectra to study the impact of possible dips and peaks in the background spectrum on the derived dm limits .",
    "in particular , we include in these realizations all pulsars within 4kpc from us , except for millisecond pulsars and pulsars in binary systems . while we keep their individual locations and ages in all realizations fixed , we vary i ) the local cr diffusion properties and energy - losses , ii ) the cuts on the current spin - down power of pulsars as recorded in the atnf catalogue and , most importantly , iii ) the fraction @xmath99 of initial rotational energy of the individual neutron stars that is injected into the ism in the form of @xmath2 .",
    "we then fit to the ams data the injection spectral properties ( taken to be the same for all pulsars ) , the _ averaged _ value of @xmath99 , the primary sne @xmath94 , secondary @xmath2 cr flux normalizations and the solar modulation potential .",
    "even though the injection @xmath2 spectrum is taken to be the same for simplicity , however , the propagated pulsar spectra differ because of the different ages , distances and energy outputs ; this is clearly seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : limitsrand ] where we plot the resulting positron fraction . for dm channels that give broad continuous spectra , such as muons and taus ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", the presence of multiple peaks and dips is unimportant .",

    "[ fig : ts ] we show , for the case of @xmath48 final states , the local significance for a dm signal as function of the dm mass .",

    "we do not find any indications for local , edge - like , features in the ams data .",
    "lastly , as a simple cross - check , we have also run darksusy @xcite with standard parameters for propagation ( based on the prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and an nfw profile normalized to 0.4 gev @xmath15 . for the electron spectrum ,",
    "we used a simple broken power law which agrees with the pamela electron data @xcite for @xmath103gev . knowing that the ams positron fraction measurement is well described by a simple background model",
    ", we then just demand that the dm signal does not exceed the reported @xmath104 error bars at the energy of the feature .",
