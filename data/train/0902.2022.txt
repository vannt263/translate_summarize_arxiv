    "quasar absorption line systems with strong lyman-@xmath0 lines are often divided into two classes : damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dlas , log n@xmath3@xmath8 20.3 ) and sub - damped lyman-@xmath0 ( sub - dla 19 @xmath9 log n@xmath3@xmath10 20.3 , @xcite ) which contain a major fraction of the neutral gas in the universe , while the majority of the baryons are thought to lie in the highly ionized and diffuse lyman-@xmath0 forest clouds with log n@xmath3@xmath9 15 in intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "the lower threshold of log n@xmath3=20.3 for classification of dlas stems from previous 21 cm emission studies of nearby spirals , where the sensitivity limited column density of log n@xmath3@xmath720.3 was seen to lie near the holmberg radius ( r@xmath11 ) of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the damping wings which can be used to accurately measure n@xmath3 in these systems do begin the sub - dla regime of log n@xmath3@xmath1219.0 . with their high gas content , the dla and sub - dla systems",
    "are believed to be associated directly with galaxies at all redshifts in which they are seen .    among the many elements often detected in qso absorber systems including c , n , o , mg , si , s , ca , ti , cr , mn , fe , ni , and zn , zn is the preferred tracer of the gas - phase metallicity as it is relatively undepleted in the galactic ism , especially when the fraction of h in molecular form is low , as is the case in most dlas .",
    "zn also tracks the fe abundance in galactic stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the lines of zn ii @xmath132026,2062 are relatively weak and typically unsaturated . these lines can be covered with ground based spectroscopy over a wide range of redshifts , 0.65 @xmath9 z @xmath9 3.5 , which covers a large portion ( @xmath14 ) of the history of the universe .",
    "abundances of refractory elements such as cr and fe relative to zn also give a measure of the amount of dust depletion @xcite .",
    "abundance ratios such as [ si / fe ] , [ o / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] shed light on the enrichment from the different types of supernovae , as the @xmath0-capture elements si and o for example are produces mainly in type ii explosions while the iron peak elements are produced mainly by type ia supernovae .    in previous studies ,",
    "dla systems have been the preferred systems for chemical abundance investigation owing to their high gas content @xcite .",
    "most dlas however have been found to be metal poor , typically far below the solar level and below where models predict the mean metallicity should be at the corresponding redshifts at which they are seen ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sub - dla systems have until recently been largely ignored , with their contribution to the overall metal budget unknown .",
    "evidence for the possibility of a non - negligible contribution from sub - dlas to the metal budget came from @xcite , who noted that based on fe ii lines the sub - dla systems have faster evolution of the fe abundance and higher abundances on average than dla systems .",
    "this has also been validated by @xcite .",
    "galactic chemical evolution is a slow process , and long timescales must be examined to search for the signs of the gradual chemical enrichment that models predict @xcite . although redshifts @xmath15 span  70@xmath16 of the age of the universe ( using a concordance cosmology of @xmath17 , h@xmath18=70 km s@xmath19mpc@xmath19 ) , few observations have been made of @xmath15 sub - dlas due to the lack of spectrographs with enough sensitivity in short wavelengths and the paucity of known sub - dlas in this redshift range .",
    "with such a large fraction of the age of the universe covered in the redshift regime , it is clearly important for understanding the nature of sub - dla systems and galactic chemical evolution as well .",
    "we have greatly increased the sample of sub - dlas in past several years with our vlt uves and magellan - ii mike spectra . in this paper",
    ", we report on ten new systems observed with the mike spectrograph on the magellan - ii clay telescope .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in @xmath20 [ sec : obs ] , we discuss details of our observations and data reduction techniques . @xmath20",
    "[ sec : objects ] gives details on the individual objects in these new observations .",
    "@xmath20 [ sec : mnfe ] investigates the ratio of [ mn / fe ] in qso absorbers . in @xmath20",
    "[ sec : abund ] we discuss the abundances of these absorbers and we give a brief discussion .",
    "we also provide an appendix at the end of this paper , showing plots of the uv spectra with the fits to the lyman-@xmath0 lines , and tables containing the fit parameters for the individual systems .",
    "the observations presented here were made with the 6.5 m magellan - ii clay telescope and the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph @xcite in 2007 sep .",
    "this is a double sided spectrograph with both a blue and a red camera , providing for simultaneous wavelength coverage from @xmath73340 to @xmath79400 .",
    "targets were observed in multiple exposures of 1800 to 2700 sec each to minimize cosmic ray defects .",
    "the seeing was typically @xmath10 1@xmath21 , averaging @xmath7 0.7@xmath21 .",
    "all of the target qsos were observed with the 1@xmath21x5@xmath21 slit and the spectra were binned 2x3 ( spatial by spectral ) during readout .",
    "the resolving power of the mike spectrograph is @xmath719,000 and @xmath725,000 on the red and blue sides respectively with a 1@xmath21 slit .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of the observations .",
    "these spectra were reduced using the mike pipeline reduction code in idl developed by s. burles , j. x. prochaska , and r. bernstein .",
    "wavelengths were calibrated using a th - ar comparison lamp taken after each exposure .",
    "the data were first bias subtracted from the overscan region and flat - fielded .",
    "the data were then sky - subtracted and the spectral orders were extracted using the traces from flat field images .",
    "these extracted spectra were then corrected for heliocentric velocities and converted to vacuum wavelengths .",
    "each individual order was then combined in iraf using rejection parameters to reduce the effects of cosmic rays .",
    "these combined spectra were then normalized using a polynomial , typically of order five or less , or spline function to fit the continuum .",
    "our new observations consists of 10 absorbers , nine sub - dlas and one dla z@xmath22@xmath9 1.5 .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of our selection criteria . throughout this paper",
    "the qso names are given in j2000 coordinates , except in table 1 where the original name , based on j1950 coordinates is also given if applicable @xcite ."
