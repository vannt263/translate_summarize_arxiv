    "we present in this contribution the results obtained by solving the faddeev - yakubowski ( fy ) equations in configuration space for the 4n system with special interest in their scattering states .",
    "the a=4 chart presents a very rich continuum and constitutes a challenge for the theoretical models .",
    "we have limited our study to the energy region below the first inelastic channel .",
    "all the calculations have been carried out in the isospin approximation , i.e neglecting coulomb forces . next section will be devoted to a short presentation of the fy formalism . in section 3",
    "we will discuss the results : first those obtained in the s - wave approximation for the different ( t , s ) channels and secondly those concerning the n - t scattering with realistic interactions .",
    "the fy equations for 4 interacting particles are obtained by first splitting the total wavefunction @xmath1 in the usual faddeev amplitudes , @xmath2 , associated with each of the interacting pair .",
    "each of these amplitudes is in its turn splitted in 3 parts , the fy amplitudes , corresponding to the different asymptotics of the remaining two non interacting particles .",
    "the schrdinger equation is equivalent to the set of 18 coupled equations for which it is possible to define appropriate boundary conditions ensuring the unicity of the solution .    in the case of identical particles ,",
    "the 18 fy amplitudes can be obtained by the action of the permutation operators @xmath3 on two of them , denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 amplitudes satisfy the following equations : @xmath7\\label{fye1}\\\\ ( e - h_0-v)h & = & v\\left [ ( p_{13}p_{24}+p_{14}p_{23 } ) \\;k +     p_{13}p_{24 } \\ ; h\\right ]   \\label{fye2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath8 depending on whether we are dealing with bosons or fermions .",
    "each amplitude @xmath9 is considered as function of its own set of jacobi coordinates @xmath10 and expanded in angular momentum variables for each coordinate according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 are generalized tripolar harmonics containing spin , isospin and angular momentum variables and the functions @xmath13 , called fy components , are the unknowns .",
    "the label @xmath14 holds for the set of intermediate quantum numbers defined in a given coupling scheme and includes the specification for the type of amplitudes k or h. we have used the following couplings : @xmath15_{t_3 } t_4 \\right\\}_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x } ( l_y s_3)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_3 } ( l_z s_4)_{j_z } \\right\\}_j      \\cr \\mbox{h amplitudes }   & & \\left [ ( t_1 t_2)_{\\tau_x } ( t_3 t_4)_{\\tau_y } \\right]_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x }   \\left ( l_y ( s_3 s_4)_{\\sigma_y } \\right)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_{xy } } l_z \\right\\}_j \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the isospin and spin of the individual particles and @xmath18 are respectively the total isospin and angular momentum of the four - body system .",
    "each component @xmath13 is thus labelled by a set of 12 quantum numbers to which the symmetry properties of the wavefunction impose the additional constraints : @xmath19 for k and @xmath20 for h.    the boundary conditions are implemented by imposing at large enough values of @xmath21 the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions . indeed , at large values of @xmath21 and for energies below the first inelastic threshold , the solution of equation ( [ fye1 ] ) factorizes into a bound state solution of the 3n faddeev equations and a plane wave in the @xmath21 direction whereas the solution of ( [ fye2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the scattering observables are directly extracted from the logarithmic derivative of the k amplitude in the asymptotic region .",
    "the asymptotic 3n state is calculated with the same numerical scheme than the one used to solve the 4-body problem . in this case",
    "the factorization property , valid only in cartesian coordinates , is an exact numerical property and provides a strong stability test @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods used are based on the hermite spline expansion , orthogonal collocation and iterative procedures for solving the linear system .",
    "an important step in its solution is done by means of the tensor trick @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the results obtained in the s - wave approximation . by this",
    "we mean i ) an interaction which acts only on s - wave and ii ) that all the angular momenta variables in expansion ( [ kpw ] ) are zero .",
    "the interaction considered is mt i - iii with parameters given in @xcite , slightly different from those of its original version @xcite .",
    "the scattering length and effective range in different ( t , s ) channels are given in table  [ tab1 ] and compared with the existing calculations .",
    "a step behind the s - wave approximation has been achieved by considering the n - t scattering with realistic nn potentials .",
    "this reaction is a pure t=1 channel , free from the difficulties related to the coulomb interaction and for which accurate low energy scattering data exist @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated zero energy cross section is @xmath23 @xmath24 but the spin - dependent scattering length values are still controverted ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the scattering length of the singlet @xmath25 and triplet @xmath26 states with the av14 @xcite and nijmegen ii @xcite potentials .",
    "the interaction is limited to the @xmath27 waves and the fy expansion includes all the components with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the results are displayed in table  [ tab4 ] together with the @xmath22he binding energy ( @xmath30 ) and r.m.s .",
    "they are close to those presented in this conference by the pisa group @xcite and our @xmath30 value for av14 shows a relative agreement of @xmath31 with @xcite .",
    "the mt i - iii results presented in the previous section give a sligthly overestimated value for the zero energy cross section @xmath34 @xmath24 .",
    "however the inclusion of higher partial waves in the fy expansion reduces this value to @xmath35 @xmath24 in closer agreement with experiment .",
    "the corresponding scattering lengths are then @xmath36 , @xmath37 fm .",
    "the conclusion is that the considered realistic interactions on one hand give results very close to each other and on another hand fail in describing the zero energy n - t scattering as they failed in the 3n case .",
    "these problems are strongly correlated and can be solved by including a three - nucleon interaction ( tni ) .",
    "we have considered a simple phenomenological tni model @xmath38 and get the overall agreement @xmath39 mev , @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 fm , @xmath42 fm and @xmath43 @xmath24 with the parameters @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "this set of values is far from being unique and the only serious constraint is the existence of a repulsive short range part .",
    "the calculations have been completed up to the first 3-body break - up threshold by including the first negative parity states @xmath48 corresponding to a n - t relative p - waves .",
    "this region ( @xmath0 mev ) is of particular interest due to the observed structure which has been interpreted as a series of p - waves resonances @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the results obtained with mt i - iii , displayed in figure  [ nt1 ] .",
    "this model conserves separately l and s and consequently the @xmath48 states coming from s=1 are degenerated .",
    "the corresponding cross sections differ only by statistical factors .",
    "the remaining @xmath49 state comes from an @xmath50 coupling . despite the simplicity of this model the agreement with experimental data , specially in the resonance region ,",
    "is very good .",
    "only the zero energy region is a little overestimated .",
    "the n - t p - waves resonances are thus generated by s - wave nn interaction alone .",
    "the effective 1 + 3 potential is essentially due to the exchange mechanism between the four nucleons .",
    "we notice however that a first attempt in describing this cross section with @xmath51 in the k components but keeping zero all the remaining angular momenta in ( [ kpw ] ) failed .",
    "the results obtained with the av14 are plotted in figure  [ nt2 ] .",
    "they are not able to reproduce the experimental data neither in the s - wave nor in the resonance region .",
    "correcting the zero energy with our tni model results in lowering the value of the cross sections and the disagreement becomes worse .",
    "when compared to the mt i - iii results one sees that , due to non central terms in the nn potential , the different @xmath52 contributions are shifted .",
    "as a consequence the coherent enhancement is weakened and the resonance pick broadened . on another hand the @xmath53 partial cross section , which should provide the dominant contribution , is noticeably smaller . trying to account for this disagreement we have included the @xmath54 waves in @xmath55 , closing the @xmath56 shell .",
    "the results , displayed in table  [ tab5 ] , show that the corrections go in the bad direction .",
    "the results obtained with mt i - iii show the difficulty to understand these resonances in terms of the nn interaction alone .",
    "several reasons can be put forward to explain the apparent difficulty for realistic interactions in describing the n - t scattering before having to conclude about its definite failure .",
    "complementary calculations would be suitable with increasing number of fy components , by adding higher partial waves in the potential , by including realistic tni , etc .",
    "they are however in the limit of the capacities of the best existing computers .    on another hand",
    "it is intriguing that very simple interactions work so well .",
    "is it only a chance that the conjugated actions of very sophisticated forces @xmath60 result in a very simple two - body effective potential ? . or",
    "should that rather be an indication that simple effective potentials must be introduced from the very beginning in these low energy few - nucleons physics ? ."
