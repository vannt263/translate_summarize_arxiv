    "in wavelet analysis , we often use translation , dilation , and modulation of functions . for a function @xmath0 , throughout the paper we shall use the following notation @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the imaginary unit . in this paper we shall use @xmath3 as a dilation factor . in applications , @xmath4 is often taken to be a positive integer greater than one , in particular , the simplest case @xmath5 is often used .",
    "classical wavelets are often defined and studied in the time / space domain with the generating wavelet functions belonging to the square integrable function space @xmath6 . for @xmath7 and for a subset @xmath8 of square integrable functions in @xmath6 , linked to discretization of a continuous wavelet transform ( see @xcite ) , the following homogeneous wavelet system @xmath9 is generated by the translation and dilation of the wavelet functions in @xmath8 and has been extensively studied in the function space @xmath6 in the literature of wavelet analysis . to mention only a few references here ,",
    "see @xcite@xcite . in this paper , however , we shall see that it is more natural to study a nonhomogeneous wavelet system in the frequency domain .",
    "it is important to point out here that the elements in a set @xmath10 of this paper are not necessarily distinct and @xmath11 in a summation means that @xmath12 visits every element ( with multiplicity ) in @xmath10 once and only once .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 , all the functions @xmath14 are not necessarily distinct and @xmath15 in means @xmath16 .",
    "most known classical homogeneous wavelet systems @xmath17 in the literature are often derived from scalar refinable functions @xmath18 or from refinable function vectors @xmath19 in @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall the definition of a scalar refinable function here .",
    "a function or distribution @xmath18 on @xmath20 is said to be _ refinable _ ( or @xmath4-refinable ) if there exists a sequence @xmath21 of complex numbers , called the _ refinement mask _ or the _ low - pass filter _ for the scalar refinable function @xmath18 , such that @xmath22 with the above series converging in a proper sense , e.g. , in @xmath6 .",
    "wavelet functions in the generating set @xmath8 of a homogeneous wavelet system @xmath17 are often derived from the refinable function @xmath18 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 are sequences on @xmath25 , called _ wavelet masks _ or _ high - pass filters_. for the infinite series in and to make sense , one often imposes some decay condition on the refinable function @xmath18 and wavelet filters @xmath26 so that all the infinite series in and are well - defined in a proper sense .",
    "nevertheless , even for the simplest case of a compactly supported scalar refinable function ( or distribution ) @xmath18 with a finitely supported mask @xmath27 , the associated refinable function @xmath18 with mask @xmath27 does not always belong to @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , it is far from trivial to check whether @xmath28 in terms of its mask @xmath27 , see @xcite and references therein for detail .",
    "one of the motivations of this paper is to study wavelets and framelets without such stringent conditions on either the generating wavelet functions @xmath29 or their wavelet filters @xmath26 for @xmath15 .    for @xmath30",
    ", the fourier transform used in this paper is defined to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 and can be naturally extended to square integrable functions and tempered distributions . under certain assumptions , taking fourier",
    "transform on both sides of and , one can easily rewrite and in the frequency domain as follows : @xmath33 and @xmath34 provided that all the @xmath35-periodic ( lebesgue ) measurable functions @xmath36 and similarly @xmath37 are properly defined . in the following , we shall see that it is often more convenient to work with and in the frequency domain rather than and in the time / space domain .",
    "if there exist positive real numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that the @xmath35-periodic measurable function @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 for almost every @xmath42 $ ] ( this condition is automatically satisfied with @xmath43 if @xmath40 is a @xmath35-periodic trigonometric polynomial with @xmath44 ) , for a dilation factor @xmath4 such that @xmath45 , then it is easy to see ( also c.f .",
    "section  3 ) that one can define a measurable function @xmath46 such that @xmath47 regardless of whether @xmath46 in is a square integrable function or not , @xmath46 is a well - defined measurable function obviously satisfying the frequency - based refinement equation with @xmath48 being replaced by @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath46 is called the ( frequency - based ) _ standard refinable function _ with mask @xmath40 and dilation @xmath4 .",
    "all the wavelet functions @xmath49 in with @xmath50 are also well - defined measurable functions provided that all @xmath51 are measurable .",
    "this motivates us to study refinable functions and wavelets in the frequency domain using and so that we can avoid some technical issues such as the convergence of the infinite series in and as well as membership in @xmath6 of the generating refinable function @xmath18 and the generating wavelet functions @xmath52 .    for wavelets derived from refinable functions or refinable function vectors ,",
    "one of the most important key features of wavelets and framelets is its associated fast wavelet transform , which is based on the following nonhomogeneous wavelet system : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an integer , representing the coarsest decomposition ( or scale ) level of its fast wavelet transform .",
    "in fact , a one - level fast wavelet transform is just a transform between two sets of wavelet coefficients of a given function represented under two nonhomogeneous wavelet systems at two consecutive scale levels .",
    "naturally , for a multi - level wavelet transform , there is a underlying sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems at all scale levels , instead of just one single wavelet system .",
    "for a given @xmath55 at some scale @xmath56 , we shall see in this paper that via the dilation operation it naturally produces a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems @xmath57 for all integers @xmath54 with almost all properties preserved .",
    "consequently , it often suffices to study only one nonhomogeneous wavelet system instead of a sequence of them .",
    "this desirable property of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems is not shared by homogeneous wavelet systems .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath58 , the limit of the sequence @xmath59 will naturally lead to a homogeneous wavelet system @xmath17 .",
    "hence , in certain sense , a homogeneous wavelet system could be regarded as the limit system of a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems .",
    "see section  3 for more detail .    for a homogeneous wavelet system @xmath17 that is derived from a refinable function or a refinable function vector , due to the absence of a refinable function @xmath18 in the system",
    ", the homogeneous wavelet system @xmath17 does not automatically correspond to a fast wavelet transform without ambiguity .",
    "in fact , the wavelet functions in @xmath8 of @xmath17 could be derived from many other ( equivalent ) refinable functions , which correspond to different fast wavelet transforms with different sets of wavelet filters .",
    "more precisely , for a @xmath35-periodic measurable function @xmath60 such that @xmath61 for almost every @xmath32 , define @xmath62 , then it is evident that @xmath63 is also refinable and satisfies @xmath64 \\hat { \\mathring{\\phi}}(\\xi ) \\quad \\hbox{and}\\quad \\hat{\\psi}(\\df\\xi)=[\\wh{b^\\psi}(\\xi)/\\theta(\\xi ) ] \\hat{\\mathring{\\phi}}(\\xi ) , \\qquad a.e.\\ ; \\xi\\in \\r , \\ ; \\psi\\in \\psi.\\ ] ] such a change of generators from a refinable function @xmath18 to another equivalent refinable function @xmath65 is in fact the key idea in the oblique extension principle ( oep ) in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) to construct compactly supported homogeneous wavelet frames @xmath17 in @xmath6 with high vanishing moments derived from refinable functions and refinable function vectors .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion on a fast wavelet transform based on a homogeneous wavelet system obtained via oep from refinable function vectors .",
    "the effect of the change of generators on its fast wavelet transform is addressed in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in sections  3 and 4 , nonhomogeneous wavelet systems are closely related to nonstationary wavelets ( see @xcite ) and are naturally employed in a pair of nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames in a pair of dual sobolev spaces introduced in @xcite . due to these and other considerations",
    ", it seems more natural and more important for us to study nonhomogeneous wavelet systems @xmath57 rather than the extensively studied homogeneous wavelet systems @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to understand better many aspects of wavelet theory such as a wavelet filter bank induced by oep and its associated wavelets in the function setting without a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions .    following the standard notation , we denote by @xmath66 the linear space of all compactly supported @xmath67 ( test ) functions with the usual topology , and @xmath68 denotes the linear space of all distributions ,",
    "that is , @xmath68 is the dual space of @xmath66 . by duality , the definition in for translation",
    ", dilation and modulation can be easily generalized from functions to distributions .",
    "moreover , when @xmath69 in is a square integrable function or more generally a tempered distribution , for @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 in this paper , we shall use boldface letters to denote functions / distributions ( e.g. , @xmath72 ) or sets of functions / distributions ( e.g. , @xmath73 ) in the frequency domain .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be two sets of distributions on @xmath20 .",
    "for an integer @xmath54 and @xmath76 , we define _ a frequency - based nonhomogeneous wavelet system @xmath77 _ to be @xmath78 similarly , _ a frequency - based homogeneous wavelet system _ is defined as follows : @xmath79 by , it is straightforward to see that under the fourier transform , the images of @xmath57 and @xmath17 with @xmath80 are simply @xmath77 and @xmath81 , respectively , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    for @xmath84 , by @xmath85",
    "we denote the linear space of all measurable functions @xmath69 such that @xmath86 for every compact subset @xmath87 of @xmath20 , with the usual modification for @xmath88 saying that @xmath69 is essentially bounded over @xmath87 .",
    "note that @xmath89 is just the set of all measurable functions that can be globally identified as distributions .",
    "so , @xmath89 is the most natural space for us to study wavelets and framelets in the distribution space . for @xmath90 ,",
    "it is evident that @xmath91 .",
    "however , a distribution @xmath92 may not be a tempered distribution and therefore , fourier transform may not be applied so that @xmath93 holds for some tempered distribution @xmath94 . under the setting of tempered distributions on which the fourier transform can apply ,",
    "although all the definitions and results of this paper in the frequency domain could be equivalently translated into the time / space domain by the inverse fourier transform on tempered distributions , to avoid notational complexity and to avoid the a priori underlying assumption that @xmath69 is a tempered distribution if the notion @xmath95 is used , it seems very natural and convenient for us to work in the frequency domain in this paper .    for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we shall use the following paring @xmath98 when @xmath96 and @xmath99 , the duality pairings @xmath100 and @xmath101 are understood similarly as @xmath102 .",
    "now we are ready to introduce the key notion in this paper .",
    "let @xmath103 be subsets of @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath3 , we say that the pair @xmath105 , where @xmath77 is defined in , forms _ a pair of frequency - based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames in the distribution space @xmath68 _ if the following identity holds @xmath106 where the infinite series in converge in the following sense :    1 .   for every @xmath107 , the following series @xmath108 converge absolutely for all integers @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "2 .   for every @xmath107 , the following limit exists and @xmath112",
    "as we shall discuss in section  3 , the above introduced notion enables us to completely separate the perfect reconstruction property in from its stability property in function spaces .",
    "since the test function space @xmath66 is dense in many function spaces , one could extend the perfect reconstruction property ( or `` wavelet expansion '' ) in to other function spaces , provided that the involved wavelet systems have stability in these function spaces .",
    "let us give a simple example here to illustrate this connection for the particular function space @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 in be two subsets of distributions in @xmath68 .",
    "we shall see in section  3 that @xmath113 forms a pair of frequency - based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames in the distribution space , if and only if , @xmath73 are subsets of @xmath6 and latexmath:[\\[\\label{f : twf } \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\mphi } \\sum_{k\\in \\z } |\\la \\ff , \\fphi^{\\ell}_{\\df^{-j};0,k}\\ra|^2 + \\sum_{j = j}^\\infty   \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\mpsi } \\sum_{k\\in \\z }    moreover , when @xmath45 , as a direct consequence of , one automatically has @xmath115 ( that is , multiply every element in @xmath77 by the factor @xmath116 ) is an orthonormal basis of @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath124 $ ] , @xmath125 3 .",
    "the following identity holds in the sense of distributions : @xmath126 more precisely , @xmath127 for all @xmath96 .",
    "in the following , we make some remarks about theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] .",
    "we assumed in theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] that all the generating functions in @xmath120 are from the space @xmath121 .",
    "note that @xmath121 includes the fourier transforms of all compactly supported distributions and of all elements in all sobolev spaces .",
    "this assumption on membership in @xmath121 can be weakened and is only used to guarantee the absolute convergence of the infinite series in . see the remark after lemma  [ lem : converg ] in section  2 for more detail on this natural assumption .    if we assume additionally that @xmath128 for all @xmath110 and if holds for almost every @xmath32 , by lebesgue dominated convergence theorem , then holds in the sense of distributions . if all elements in @xmath120 are essentially nonnegative measurable functions , then it is not difficult to verify that the conditions in items ( i ) and ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] are equivalent to the following simple conditions : @xmath129 and @xmath130 as we shall see in section  2 , items ( i ) and ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] correspond to a natural multiresolution - like structure , which is closely linked to a fast wavelet transform .",
    "the condition in item ( iii ) of theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] is a natural normalization condition which is related to .    comparing with the characterization of a pair of homogeneous dual wavelet frames in the space @xmath6 or a homogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis in @xmath6 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] has several interesting features .",
    "firstly , the characterization in items ( i)(iii ) of theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] does not involve any infinite series or infinite sums ; this is in sharp contrast to the homogeneous setting in @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , as we shall see in section  2 , all the involved infinite sums in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] are in fact finite sums .",
    "this allows us to easily generalize theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] to any real dilation factors and to nonstationary wavelets , see sections  2 and 4 for detail .",
    "thirdly , we do not require any stability ( bessel ) property of the wavelet systems , while the homogeneous setting in @xmath6 needs the stability property to guarantee the convergence of the involved infinite series .",
    "fourthly , we do not require in theorem  [ thm : main:1 ] that the generating wavelet functions possess any order of vanishing moments or smoothness , while all the generating wavelet functions in the homogeneous setting require at least one vanishing moment .",
    "lastly , from a pair of nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames in @xmath6 , we shall see in section  3 that one can always derive an associated pair of homogeneous dual wavelet frames in @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , most homogeneous wavelet systems in the literature are derived in such a way .",

    "in contrast , our results here generally do not require any a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions and provide a natural explanation for the connection between the perfect reconstruction property induced by oep in and in the discrete filter bank setting to wavelets and framelets in the function setting .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study nonhomogeneous wavelet systems which have close relations to the fast wavelet transform and homogeneous wavelet systems . we introduce and characterize a pair of frequency - based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames in the distribution space ; the proposed notion enables us to completely separate the perfect reconstruction property of a wavelet system from its stability property in function spaces . the results in this paper lead to a natural explanation for the oblique extension principle , which has been widely used to construct dual wavelet frames from refinable functions , without any a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions and refinable functions . a nonhomogeneous wavelet system , which is not necessarily derived from refinable functions via a multiresolution analysis , not only has a natural multiresolution - like structure that is closely linked to the fast wavelet transform , but also plays a basic role in understanding many aspects of wavelet theory . to illustrate the flexibility and generality of the approach in this paper </S>",
