    "one large class of models is that in which the interactions responsible for the symmetry breaking are strongly coupled . for this class of models",

    "in this paper we use the latest measurements of partial decay widths of the @xmath0 boson to place bounds on anomalous gauge boson couplings .",

    "it is well known that this scenario can be described with an effective lagrangian with operators organized according to the number of derivatives or gauge fields they have .",
