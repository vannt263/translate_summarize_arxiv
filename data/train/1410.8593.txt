    "an approximation like this is not necessary for the gravitational analogue in order to obtain a topological theory ; it is already topological irrespective of the value of @xmath9 .",

    "our goal is to study the large distance behavior of the theory by neglecting second and higher order terms in @xmath13 .",
    "neglecting the potential energy term is standard practice in these type of cases .",
    "the reasoning is as follows .",
    "since the energy is low , charges move very slowly and do not create significant magnetic fields@xcite .",
