    "in recent years , intense laser - atom physics has received more and more attention @xcite , due to the nonlinear multiphoton phenomena , such as high - order harmonic generation and above - threshold ionization . without doubt",
    ", such multiphoton phenomena could be reproduced by resolving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . in order to understand such phenomena intuitively , some semiclassical approaches , mixing classical and quantum arguments ,",
    "have been proposed @xcite . in the semiclassical approaches ,",
    "the motion of ionized electrons is treated by classical dynamics directly , while quantum mechanics is used before the ionization .",
    "these semiclassical approaches have obtained much success in intense laser - atom physics , although there is no explicit evidence for their key assumption that the ionized electron can be treated by the classical mechanics directly @xcite .",
    "bohmian mechanics ( bm ) @xcite also called quantum trajectory method @xcite is another version of quantum theory , in which trajectory concept is used to describe the motion of particles with the bohm - newton equation .",
    "it has been successfully used to study some fundamental quantum phenomena such as the two - slit experiment @xcite and tunneling @xcite . recently , oriol _ et al _",
    "@xcite used bm to simulate the electron transport in mesoscopic systems .",
    "@xcite applied this theory to the atom surface physics .",
    "et al _ derived some central potentials @xcite and two - dimensional noncentral potentials @xcite from bm to investigate the exact classical limit of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "bm has also been regarded as a resultful approach to studying chaos @xcite , due to its description of trajectory for the quantum system .",
    "it has also been successfully applied to the intense laser - atom physics to study the dynamics of above - threshold ionization @xcite and high - order harmonic generation @xcite by authors .",
    "the only difference between the bohm - newton equation and newton equation is that there is an extra term in the bohm - newton equation , called quantum potential .",
    "when quantum potential is negligible , the bohm - newton equation will reduce to the standard newton equation and then the motion of particles can be described by classical mechanics .    in this paper ,",
    "bm is introduced to the intense laser - atom physics .",
    "we first obtain the electron quantum trajectories of an atomic ensemble from the bohm - newton equation .",
    "next we study how the quantum potentials change as the electrons are driven away from the parent ion by the laser field .",
    "we find that quantum potentials trend to be smaller and then become completely negligible soon after the electrons were ionized . in this case",
    ", the bohm - newton equation reduces to newton equation , and then the motion of electrons can be described by classical equation of motion .",
    "thus , our results present a direct positive evidence for the previous semiclassical trajectory methods in intense laser - atom physics where the motion of ionized electrons is treated by classical mechanics directly , while quantum mechanics is needed before the ionization . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical results clearly show how far the electron from the core as it was ionized , while the initial position of the ionized electron is usually chosen to be 0 ( the position of the core ) in the semiclassical approaches @xcite .",
    "bm @xcite is derived from a subtle transformation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "firstly , a wavefunction can be written in the polar form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2are real functions .",
    "secondly , the wavefunction is inserted into the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the real part of the resulting equation has the form@xmath3 and the imaginary part is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the ordinary potential . equation ( [ qp ] ) is similar to the classical hamilton - jacobi equation , except it has an extra term , @xmath8 .",
    "this term , denoted by @xmath9 in this paper , is usually called the quantum potential .",
    "equation ( [ qc ] ) looks like the classical continuity equation .",
    "so a bohm - newton equation of motion for a bohmian particle can be constructed : @xmath10 from the standpoint of classical mechanics .",
    "the motion of particle is determined by the ordinary potential @xmath7 and the quantum potential @xmath11 which plays a crucial role for the appearance of quantum phenomena . obviously ,",
    "when quantum potential @xmath12 in equation ( [ bn ] ) , the bohm - newton equation will reduce to the standard newton equation and then the motion of particle can be described by classical mechanics .",
    "in fact , the trajectory of particles can be evolved from a much simpler equation of motion instead of equation ( [ bn ] ) @xcite : @xmath13 to obtain the trajectory , we need to know the phase @xmath14 and the initial positions of particles . according to bm , the initial distribution of particles in an ensemble is given by @xmath15 .",

    "magnetic quantum number @xmath24 of the atom is a good quantum number , so that the problem of solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation here can be simplified into a two - dimensional problem ( see figure [ 1](a ) ) . in our study",
    "we use the grid method and the second - order split - operator technique to numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( [ tdse ] ) , which has been detailedly introduced by tong and chu @xcite .",

    "explicitly , we present four trajectories of electron with the corresponding initial positions in figure [ 2 ] .",
    "let s take one electron trajectory as an example with @xmath40 au , @xmath41 in the polar coordinate .",
    "the path of the electron has the following character in the spatial coordinate : the motion is irregular when the electron is near the parent ion ; after the electron has been driven far away from the parent ion by the intense laser field , it travels in a straight line with a little oscillation .",
    "the reason why the motion of the electron keeps oscillating as the electron is far away from the parent ion is due to the existence of the laser field .",
    "the other trajectories with different initial positions have similar character as shown in figure [ 2 ] .     and @xmath42 directions as functions of time .",
    "the corresponding initial positions of electrons are , from ( a ) to ( d ) , @xmath32 au@xmath43 , @xmath34 au@xmath33 , @xmath32 au@xmath35 , and @xmath32 au@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the motion of the electron in @xmath45 direction is uniform while its motion in @xmath46 direction has undulations as the electron is far from the core .",
    "the reason for the @xmath46-undulation is due to the existence of laser field ( @xmath47 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] +    in figure [ 3 ] , we show the projections of electron trajectory in @xmath46 and @xmath42 directions , respectively , as functions of time . in figure",
    "[ 3](a ) , two curves @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained from the electron trajectory with @xmath40 au , @xmath41 . at the beginning ,",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are near the core . after the time @xmath50 au",
    ", @xmath48 becomes a regular wave curve and @xmath49 seems to be a straight line .",
    "similarly , we have obtained the projections of three other electron trajectories with their initial positions @xmath31 ( see figures 3(b)-(d ) ) .",
    "all of them have the similar character as that in figure [ 3](a ) .",

    "if the value of @xmath9  smoothly trends to be negligible ( @xmath52 ) , equation ( [ bn ] ) will reduce to newton equation and then the motion of electron can be described by classical mechanics .",
    "now we study the change of quantum potential for an atomic electron as it is driven away by the laser field . after obtaining the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath37 and the electron trajectories @xmath53 , we calculate the changes of quantum potential @xmath54 ( see appendix b ) . in figure [ 4 ]",
    ", we show the time - dependent values of quantum potential @xmath54 and ordinary potential @xmath55 with the corresponding initial positions @xmath31 . here",
    "we take the electron with @xmath40 au , @xmath41 as an example ( see figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "the value of quantum potential is comparable with that of ordinary potential in the early period .",
    "after some time , _",
    "e.g. _ , after 100 au about , quantum potential smoothly becomes smaller and then it trends to be negligible , particularly after the time @xmath56 au the changes of quantum potential of three other electrons are presented in figures 4(b)-(d ) , and they have the similar character as that in figure [ 4](a ) . in this way , our numerical results present an explicit picture of the reduction from the bohm - newton equation to newton equation .",
    "consequently , the bohmian trajectory method can give both the quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of an atomic electron in intense laser - atom physics .",
    "au@xmath33 , @xmath34 au@xmath33 , @xmath32 au@xmath35 , and @xmath32 au@xmath44 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=480 ] +    as we have shown above , the bohm - newton equation of electron is approaching to newton equation in intense laser - atom physics , as the electron was driven far away from the parent ion . in the previous semiclassical approaches of intense laser - atom physics , the ionized electron motion is usually treated by the classical dynamics , while quantum mechanics is used before the ionization @xcite . here , we want to verify whether the motion of an electron can be treated by classical dynamics or not , i.e. whether the quantum potential becomes negligible or not , as it has been ionized .    in figure",
    "[ 5 ] , we show the total energies of an electron ( including kinetic energy , coulomb potential and quantum potential ) with different initial positions . when the total energy becomes positive ,",
    "the electron will be ionized . here",
    "we take the electron with @xmath40 au , @xmath41 as an example ( see figure 5(a ) ) . at the beginning ,",
    "the value of the total energy is less than zero , i.e. the electron is bounded by the core .",
    "after the time @xmath57 au , the total energy becomes positive but it then turns to the negative at the time @xmath58 au the reason why the total energy of the ionized electron turns to the negative again may be that the electron with low energy is not far enough from the core and it is recaptured by the parent ion with a photon emitted when the laser field reverses . the total energy becomes positive again and higher than before at @xmath59 au and thereafter , i.e. the electron can never be recaptured again by the parent ion . on the other hand , in figure [ 4](a ) , we found the value of quantum potential of the electron trends to be trivial soon after the time @xmath59 au ( the corresponding distance between the ionized electron and the core is 16.2 au about ; see figure 3 ) .",
    "similarly , in figures 5(b)-(d ) and 4(b)-(d ) , we can find when the electron is ionized , the corresponding quantum potential trends to be negligible .",
    "therefore , our numerical solutions show that the quantum potential is negligible as the ionized electron was driven far away from the core and thus the motion of ionized electron is dominated by classical mechanics . in this way , our work may present a direct positive evidence for the semi - empirical assumption in the semiclassical approaches of intense laser - atom physics , such as the three - step model @xcite and feynman s path - integral approach in the strong field approximation @xcite , in which the motion of ionized electrons is treated by classical dynamics directly .",
    "furthermore , the bohmian trajectory method can help us to find how far the electron from the core when it was ionized , while the initial position of an ionized electron is assumed to be 0 in the semiclassical approaches @xcite .",
    "as it has been discussed above , quantum potential dominates the quantum behavior of a physical system . in the prior work of quasistatic model of strong - field multiphoton",
    "ionization @xcite , a dual procedure was considered to describe the multiphoton phenomena in intense laser - field physics .",
    "first a tunneling model is applied to obtain the ionization rate and describe the formation of a sequence of wave packets .",
    "the second part of the quasistatic procedure uses the classical mechanics to describe the evolution of an electron wave packet .",
    "it has been pointed out definitely that only the newton equation can not give the ionization rate correctly , unless a quantum tunneling process was allowed @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical results in this paper : the quantum potential can not be ignored before the ionization , i.e. quantum mechanics is needed to study the behavior of the electron before the ionization , but the motion of an ionized electron can be described by classical mechanics directly .",
    "it is interesting that mahmoudi _ et al _ @xcite have studied free - electron quantum signatures in intense laser fields by looking for negativities in the winger distribution .",
    "they concluded that the quantum signatures of the free electron get washed away , provided the dipole approximation is made . in this way",
    ", their work presents another evidence for the treatment of ionized electron in the semiclassical approaches of intense laser - atom physics .",
    "we thank j. b. delos and l. you for helpful discussions . this work is supported by national basic research program of china under grant no . 2006cb921203 .",
    "in this appendix , we show how to obtain the electron quantum trajectory from equation ( [ bm ] ) .",
    "first , equation ( [ bm ] ) can be expressed as ( atomic units are used ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the imaginary part of @xmath63 . in our study",
    "@xmath37 is gained by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( [ tdse ] ) , using the grid method and the second - order split - operator technique , which has been detailedly introduced by tong and chu @xcite .",
    "then we use the runge - kutta method to evolve equation ( [ a1 ] ) to obtain the electron quantum trajectory .    in our numerical procedure ,",
    "the range of the variable @xmath64 in the radial direction is confined to @xmath65 au@xmath66 . in the grid method ,",
    "the numbers of grid points are @xmath67 in the @xmath68 direction and @xmath69 in the @xmath70 direction .",
    "the time step for the evolution is @xmath71 au",
    "after obtaining the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath37 and the electron quantum trajectory @xmath53 with the corresponding initial position @xmath31 , we can numerically obtain the value of the quantum potential @xmath54 along the trajectory @xmath53 .",
