    "it is often assumed that protostructures formed as primordial density fluctuations are amplified by gravity .",
    "the initial density field is generally assumed to be a gaussian random field and the amplitude of fluctuations on all scales is then characterised by the density power spectrum .",
    "an appealing consequence of this gravitational instability model is that patches of matter are spun - up , as density inhomogeneities exert tidal torques on collapsing objects ( hoyle 1949 ) , thereby providing an explanation for the spin of galaxies .",
    "the amount of angular momentum tidally induced on a given patch of matter depends mainly on its shape and scale @xmath3 ( mass @xmath4 ) , and to a lesser extent also on its environment .",
    "simple arguments based on linear gravitational instability theory lead to values for the angular momentum of the milky way which compare favourable to observational estimates ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "the _ statistical _ distribution of the spin of collapsing objects has been obtained by studying tidal torques on ( high ) peaks of the linear gaussian density field ( hoffman 1988 ; heavens & peacock 1988 ) , in the formalism of peacock and heavens ( 1985 ) and bardeen et al .",

    "more recently , we adopted the lagrangian approach suggested by white ( 1984 ) and the bbks peaks formalism to derive the probability distribution of the rms spin @xmath5 ( catelan & theuns 1996a ) : we showed that the distribution of this variable is practically indistinguishable from that of the modulus @xmath6 as obtained by heavens & peacock ( 1988 ) , indicating that the rms spin is well suited to characterise the statistics of rotational properties .",
    "in addition , we used the same formalism to derive the distribution of the specific angular momentum @xmath7 versus @xmath4 on galactic scales ( catelan & theuns 1996a ) , which allows a direct comparison with the observational data reported in fall ( 1983 ) as well as with the numerical simulations of navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 ) .",
    "the above investigations have been restricted to the linear regime , during which the galaxy spin grows proportional to the cosmic time @xmath8 ( doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) .",
    "we have carried out a theoretical analysis of how the tidal angular momentum evolves during the mildly non - linear regime ( catelan & theuns 1996b ; paper  i ) .",
    "the formalism employs perturbative solutions of the lagrangian dynamical equations describing the motion of the fluid , and assumes gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the lagrangian approach shows to be very well suited to treat the non - linear evolution of the galactic spin , because it is powerful in describing the growth of the mass - density fluctuations on the one hand ( zeldovich 1970a , b ; buchert 1992 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1992 ; catelan 1995 ) ; and on the other hand , the usual difficulty of inverting the mapping from initial lagrangian coordinates @xmath9 to eulerian coordinates @xmath10 is completely by - passed .",
    "the latter is because the angular momentum @xmath0 is invariant with respect to an eulerian or lagrangian description . in spite of the fact that the leading spin corrections grow faster ( @xmath11 ) than the linear term , the main result of the perturbative investigation as reported in paper  i is that the predictions of linear theory are rather accurate in quantifying the evolution of the angular momentum of protostructures before collapse sets in : non - linear corrections increase the rms spin by a factor @xmath12 for the cdm power spectrum on galactic scales .    in this paper",
    "we extend the perturbative investigation of paper  i by considering non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "specifically , we want to address the question whether allowing the primordial matter field to deviate from the gaussian distribution modifies the subsequent evolution of the angular momentum during the mildly non - linear regime .",
