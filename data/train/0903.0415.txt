    "electromagnetic probes - virtual ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 pairs ) and real photons - are an important and powerful tool to diagnose the hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( rhi ) .",
    "they are sensitive probes of the two fundamental properties that characterize the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and are predicted by lattice qcd numerical calculations , the deconfinement of quarks and gluons and the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "their importance has been emphasized time and again since the proposal made by shuryak back in 1978 @xcite .",
    "dileptons and photons interact only electromagnetically , and therefore their mean free path is large compared to the size of the system formed in nuclear collisions .",
    "they are not distorted by final state interactions and once produced can escape the interaction region , unaffected , carrying to the detectors information about the conditions and properties of the medium at the time of their production .",
    "electromagnetic probes are emitted over the entire space - time evolution of the collision , from the primordial parton collisions in the early stage till the hadron decays well after freeze - out .",
    "they are thus very rich in information content but this wealth is also a challenge for the measurement and subsequent analysis that need to disentangle the various sources .    the main topic of interest is the identification of radiation emitted in the form of virtual or real photons by the medium in thermal equilibrium .",
    "such radiation is a direct fingerprint of the matter formed .",
    "two well distinct sources are considered :    \\a ) thermal radiation emitted by the strongly interacting qgp in the early phase of the collision .",
    "the elementary processes involved are the quark annihilation into virtual photons ( @xmath5 ) or the annihilation ( @xmath6 ) and qcd compton ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) channels producing real photons .",
    "the identification of this signal not only serves as a proof of deconfinement but it also provides a direct measurement of one of the most basic plasma properties , the temperature , readily given by the inverse slope of its expected exponential spectral shape .",
    "theory has singled out dileptons in the mass range @xmath0 = 1 - 3 gev / c@xmath1 @xcite or real photons in the @xmath9  range @xmath9  = 1 - 3  gev / c @xcite as the most appropriate windows to observe the thermal radiation from the qgp phase .",
    "the thermal emission rate is a strongly increasing function of the temperature ; consequently it is most abundantly produced in the early stage when the temperature and the energy density have their largest values ; the sensitivity to identify it increases the higher the initial temperature is relative to the critical temperature of the phase transition .",
    "it should be easier to observe the qgp thermal radiation at lhc than at rhic than at sps . for almost two decades",
    "this has been a very elusive signal and it is only recently that phenix at rhic @xcite and na60 at sps @xcite presented results that could signal the thermal radiation from the qgp .",
    "\\b ) thermal radiation is also emitted by the high - density hadron gas ( hg ) in the later phase of the collision .",
    "the main elementary process here is the pion annihilation into dileptons , mediated through vector meson dominance by the @xmath10 meson ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the hg thermal radiation , controlled by the pole at the @xmath10 mass of the pion electromagnetic form factor , contributes primarily to the low - mass region , ( @xmath0 @xmath12 1gev / c@xmath1 ) around and below the @xmath10 mass @xcite .",
    "this component must always be present since ultimately the system ends in the hadronic phase and was readily identified in the enhancement of low - mass dileptons discovered at the sps in the mid - nineties @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of low - mass dileptons is one of the main highlights of the cern sps heavy - ion program .",
    "it triggered a huge theoretical activity stimulated mainly by interpretations based on in - medium modifications of the intermediate @xmath10 meson with a possible link to chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) .",
    "( for theoretical reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the sps results motivated also new experiments aiming at precise spectroscopic studies of the vector meson resonances , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , to explore in - medium modifications of their spectral properties ( mass and width ) .",
    "this topic is of interest in its own right and more so because these modifications could shed light into the behavior of the resonances _ close _ to the chiral restoration boundary . by definition",
    "there are no hadrons in the qgp phase .",
    "hadrons are formed in the mixed phase ( if there is one ) or in the hot and dense hg close to the phase boundary ; their decay there into lepton pairs can convey valuable information about their properties close to the onset of csr .",
    "the @xmath10 meson with its short lifetime , @xmath15 1.3 fm / c , and its strong coupling to the @xmath16 channel is best suited in this context , making it the most sensitive signal for in - medium modifications and the best probe for csr . a basic question with no clear answer is how the restoration of chiral symmetry is realized .",
    "the well established features are that the chiral condensate @xmath17 drops to zero at the phase transition and that in a chirally symmetric world the chiral doublets ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath18 ) become degenerate in mass .",
    "unfortunately , this degeneracy is practically impossible to establish experimentally .",
    "other implications on the hadron spectral properties ( mass and width ) are uncertain ; there is no rigorous connection of the chiral condensate to the spectral properties of hadrons .",
    "almost all models predict an increase of the width of the @xmath10 meson at the chiral transition @xcite but for the behavior of the mass there is no clear picture ; in several models the @xmath10 mass is predicted to drop to zero @xcite in other models it remains constant @xcite , or even increases @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "experimental insights are very valuable to guide and constrain these models .",
    "a significant breakthrough has been achieved recently in this respect with the precision measurements of na60 @xcite , confirmed also by the upgraded ceres experiment @xcite , which show a significant increase of the width , with no significant mass shift , of the @xmath10 meson at sps energies .",
    "the experimental results seem to be telling us that the approach to csr proceeds through broadening , and eventually melting , of the resonances rather than by dropping masses .",
    "the interest in electromagnetic probes is strengthened by the light vector mesons ( lvm ) studied through their leptonic decays .",
    "the special role of the @xmath10 meson was already emphasized in the previous paragraphs ; the other vector mesons , @xmath19 and @xmath14 , can in principle reveal the same effects related to csr as the @xmath10 .",
    "however , the effects are relatively small",
    ". the @xmath19 and @xmath14 , with their much longer lifetimes , will decay predominantly outside the medium after regaining the vacuum properties ; only a small fraction of them will decay inside the medium making the effects much harder to observe through direct spectral shape analysis . a more promising way to unveil these effects",
    "is provided by the simultaneous measurement , within the same apparatus , of the @xmath14 meson yield through the @xmath3 and @xmath20 decay channels . with @xmath21",
    "even a small in - medium effect on the @xmath14 or kaon spectral shapes may have a sizable effect on the @xmath14 yield measured through the @xmath20 decay channel .",
    "meson has attracted additional attention . the production mechanism in pp vs aa collisions is an open question .",
    "consisting of @xmath22 @xmath14 is the lightest meson with hidden strangeness and can provide information about the role of strangeness production in rhi collisions .",
    "these are two topics of great interest in their own right but outside the scope of the present article . ]    the sps results have also triggered a strong experimental program focused on the exploration of in - medium modifications of the lvm in elementary reactions .",
    "pa and photoabsorption reactions at relatively low energies have been mainly studied in this context .",
    "the idea is to avoid the complications due to time variations of the temperature and density inherent to rhi collisions by creating a low - momentum particle inside cold nuclear matter and observing its decay through dileptons .",
    "the disadvantage of course is that the predicted effects are much smaller than in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the difficulties in detecting these small effects probably explain the somewhat confusing experimental situation .",
    "contrary to the nuclear case where all systems studied show an enhancement of dileptons , there is not yet a coherent picture that emerges from the present studies in elementary reactions .",
    ".experiments involved in dilepton , photon and light vector meson measurements in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the energy is quoted in gev per nucleon in the lab .",
    "system with the exception of phenix and star where the energy is in the c.m.s . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the experimental results reported so far are very interesting but still insufficient for a consistent picture to emerge . the first positive result came from the kek - ps e325 experiment that measured the lvm in 12 gev p+c and p+cu collisions with an excellent mass resolution , @xmath231% at the @xmath14 mass .",
    "the measurements were performed in the target rapidity region to enhance the decay probability of the virtual photon inside nuclear matter .",

    "the wa98 experiment observed a photon excess in pb+pb collisions at 158  agev @xcite .",
    "the excess is small , only a 1 - 2@xmath45 effect , and was observed only in central collisions ( in peripheral events the yield is consistent with the expectations from hadron decays ) .",

    "this contribution saturates the yield at high @xmath9 when supplemented with a transverse momentum k@xmath47 broadening ( cronin effect ) and ( ii ) thermal photons that dominate the low @xmath9 part of the spectrum , predominantly emitted from the hadron gas ( @xmath48 gas ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the latter was calculated using the same many body approach that successfully explained the excess of low - mass dileptons discussed in section  [ subsec : sps ] thus providing a consistent description of both the excess of low - mass dileptons and the excess of real photons in terms of thermal radiation from the hadronic phase .",
    "the qgp contribution was found to be relatively small in the entire @xmath9 range .",
    "an interesting and original analysis has recently been presented by phenix at rhic @xcite .",
    "capitalizing on the idea that every source of real photons should also emit virtual photons @xcite and in order to avoid the huge physics background inherent to real photon measurements , phenix analyzed @xmath3 pairs emitted in au+au collisions at @xmath42  =  200  gev with low masses ( @xmath49 @xmath50 300  mev / c@xmath1 ) and high transverse momentum ( 1@xmath50 @xmath9 @xmath50 5  gev / c ) . in this restricted kinematic window",

    "the figure also shows the baseline spectrum measured in p+p collisions .",
    "the p+p data are well described by nlo pqcd direct photon calculations ( see solid lines on the p+p data ) and by a power - law fit ( dashed line on the p+p data ) @xcite .",
    "the au+au data on the other hand are clearly above the t@xmath51 scaled p+p fit ( see dashed line on the au+au data ) and require an additional source .",

    "the fit yields an inverse slope parameter which is within errors independent of centrality and found to be t = 221 @xmath35 19 @xmath35 19 mev in central collisions .",

    "in spite of the experimental difficulties , huge progress has been achieved over the past fifteen years in the measurement of electromagnetic observables . like other aspects of the relativistic heavy ion program , the field",
    "is largely driven by experiment .    at sps energies ,",
    "all heavy - ion experiments have observed an enhancement of dileptons compared to the expected known sources and a coherent picture seems to emerge for the entire range of dilepton masses . in the lmr , the enhancement is associated with the thermal radiation ( mainly @xmath11 ) emitted by the high density hadronic phase , close to the phase boundary , with strong in - medium modifications of the intermediate @xmath10 .",
    "it seems that the onset of chiral symmetry restoration proceeds through broadening and subsequent melting of the resonances rather than by dropping masses .",
    "the enhancement in the imr is not due to charm enhancement as originally suspected .",
    "it is also associated to thermal radiation but the temperature derived from the inverse slope of the exponential @xmath52 distributions strongly suggests a partonic rather than hadronic origin .    at low energies of 1 - 2  agev , the dls puzzle could be close to a solution with the recent hades results on elementary p+p and p+d collisions indicating no enhancement of low - mass @xmath3 pairs in c+c collisions but rather a mere superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "if confirmed , this implies an onset of the low - mass dilepton enhancement somewhere in the energy range of 2 - 40  agev , almost the same energy range where the qcd critical point is being looked for in existing ( rhic , sps ) and planned ( fair , nica ) facilities .    at the high energies of rhic , first results from phenix are now available .",
    "the observed enhancement in the lmr appears different from the one observed at the sps and may require an additional source .",
    "the apparent lack of enhancement in the imr is intriguing . further insight to elucidate these results",
    "will require measurements with better signal to background ratio and the ability to recognize displaced vertices , both expected with upgrade projects that are being implemented in the phenix detector .",
    "combining results of low - mass dileptons with measurements of real photons , phenix identified an excess of direct photons ( beyond the expectations based on measurements of p+p collisions scaled to the nuclear case with t@xmath51 ) with an exponential spectral shape .",
    "interpreted as thermal radiation , this excess reflects an initial temperature of 300  mev for a thermalization time of 0.6  fm / c .    a variety of precise spectroscopic studies to identify in - medium modifications of the lvm in elementary reactions where the conditions are very well defined , is underway .",
    "effects of broadening and dropping mass are reported but there is no coherent picture so far and in particular not all results seem to be reconcilable with the experience gained in nuclear collisions at the sps .",
    "more data are clearly needed .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the lvm in nuclear collisions are much more challenging , in particular the direct spectral shape analysis of the @xmath19 and @xmath14 . an alternative method , the simultaneous measurement of the @xmath14 through its @xmath20 and @xmath3 decay modes , is pursued at sps and rhic to provide evidence for the expected in - medium modification of the @xmath14 . at sps , no effects are seen in in+in whereas the available results on pb+pb are inconclusive .",
    "results from phenix at rhic are also inconclusive due to the large uncertainties of the dilepton data .",
