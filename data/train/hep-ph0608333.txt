    "the expression jet tomography often used to describe the analysis of hard pqcd processes taking place inside the soft matter created in an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "in particular the focus is on the nuclear suppression of hard hadrons in a - a collisions compared with the scaled expectation from p - p collisions due to loss of energy from the hard parton by interactions with the soft medium ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the nuclear suppression factor @xmath2 is a rather integral quantity , arising in model calculations from the schematical convolution of the hard pqcd vacuum cross section @xmath3 for the production of a parton @xmath4 , the energy loss probability @xmath5 given the vertex position and path through the medium and the vacuum fragmentation function @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes the nuclear parton distribution function dependent on the parton momentum fraction @xmath10 and the hard momentum scale @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the the partonic pqcd cross section .",
    "( [ e - folding ] ) has to be properly averaged over all possible vertices distributed according to the nuclear overlap @xmath13 and paths through the medium . in @xcite",
    "we have argued that it is possible to factorize this spatial averaging from the momentum space formulation eq .",
    "( [ e - folding ] ) and thus define the geometry - averaged energy loss probability @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath0 can thus be viewed as providing constraints for the form of @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "[ f - comp ] we show trial distributions @xmath14 based on different possible scenarios how the medium induces jet quenching .",
    "although the form of the individual @xmath14 differs substantially , the resulting @xmath0 is very similar .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 does not provide strong enough constraints to extract medium properties reliably except for the fact that quenching is substantial @xcite .",
    "however , given that assumptions about the longitudinal and transverse flow profile ( while requiring that the soft hadron spectra agree with data ) can alter the medium quenching power by a factor of five @xcite , this means that any attempt to gain access to information about the medium density must involve observables beyond @xmath0 . in @xcite we demonstrated that @xmath15-hadron correlations @xcite are capable of resolving the differences ; in this paper we re interested in the additional information accessible by angular correlation measurements .",
    "energy and momentum lost by a hard parton reappear in the medium .",
    "we make the assumption that the bulk of the lost energy excites a shockwave in the soft medium .",
    "if we study back - to - back production of hard partons and require one of the partons to yield a hard hadron trigger , the angular correlation pattern associated with this trigger consists of two components with distinct properties",
    ". first , there are the remnants of the hard processes  next to leading hadrons created in the fragmentation alongside the trigger and hadrons created in the fragmentation of the away side parton whenever this traverses the medium .",
    "the only place medium properties appear in this contribution is the amount of energy lost from the partons , but as long as fragmentation occurs in vacuum , neither correlation angular position nor width is determined by the medium , only the correlation strength .",
    "in contrast , of the soft process ( i.e. the excited shockwave ) only the strength is not determined by the medium but by the lost energy . the position is largely determined by the medium speed of sound @xmath16 @xcite and its width by the freeze - out conditions @xcite .",
    "we describe the hard underlying process by monte - carlo sampling eq .",
    "( [ e - folding ] ) for the near and away side .",
    "the energy loss probability @xmath17 given the path is determined by using bdmps radiative energy loss in the formulation of @xcite by evaluating line integrals over the local quenching power along the path of the hard parton @xcite . as a description of the medium we mainly consider a parametrized evolution capable of describing a plethora of bulk observables @xcite but we also study a hydrodynamical evolution @xcite .    in order to simulate the shockwave we follow the flow of energy and momentum .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath4 of the energy and momentum lost to the medium excites a shockwave characterized by a dispersion relation @xmath18 and a fraction @xmath19 in essence heats the medium and leads to collective drift along the jet axis to conserve momentum @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath16 from a quasiparticle description of the equation of state .",
    "the dispersion relation along with the energy and momentum deposition determines the initial angle of propagation of the shock front with the jet axis ( the mach angle ) as @xmath20 .",
    "we discretize the time into small intervals @xmath21 , calculate the energy deposited in that time as @xmath22 and then propagate the part of the shockfront remaining in the midrapidity slice ( i.e. in the detector acceptance ) .",
    "each piece of the front is propagated with the local speed of sound and the angle of propagation is constantly adjusted as @xmath23 once an element of the wavefront reaches the freeze - out condition @xmath24 , a hydrodynamical mode can not propagate further . in the local restframe",
    ", we have a matching condition for the dispersion relations @xmath18 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of a volume element at @xmath27 .",
    "once we have calculated the additional boost @xmath28 a volume element receives from the shockwave using the matching conditions , we use the cooper - frye formula to convert the fluid element into a distribution of hadrons .",
    "at an associate cut of about 1 gev , the system is clearly dominated by the recoil of the hydro medium , we observe almost no away side partons emerging from the medium in the simulation .",
    "the shockwave shows a strong influence on longitudinal and transverse flow : due to the fact that the rapidity @xmath29 of the away side parton is not fixed by the rapidity of the trigger hadron , an averaging over @xmath29 leads to an apparent shrinking of the cone @xcite , cf .",
    "[ f - elongation ] . for a scenario which does not couple to longitudinal flow",
    ", this effect leads to disagreement with the data .",
    "however , for a hydro mode the shock cone is longitudinally elongated due to its coupling to flow , therefore its spatial extension is the solution of the characteristic equation @xmath30 and the subsequent widening in rapidity space leads to agreement with the data .",
    "any scenario which does not couple to longitudinal flow must thus necessarily exhibit an even wider angle before averaging .",
    "transverse flow has no great influence on the position of the angle , but due to the fact that high @xmath1 correlations in a hydro + shockwave description are only generated when flow and shockwave are almost aligned , it may lead to the apparent disappearance of one wing of the shockwave at sufficiently high @xmath1 ( which is recovered at lower @xmath1 for some initial vertices .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ f - disappearance ] .",
    "this has considerable impact on the interpretation of 3-particle correlation data .",
    "it is clear that the relative importance of the hard and soft component of the correlation will depend on both trigger threshold and associate hadron cut .",
    "as soon as hydrodynamic flow of thermalized matter ceases to be the chief mechanism of hadron preduction at given @xmath1 , it can not longer be assumed that shockwaves dominate the correlations .",
    "even for a 20 gev trigger hadron , one can not expect to find shockwave correlations at 6 gev , simply because there is no hydro medium to support them at this scale .",
    "thus , the rising associate cut will in general shift the focus from soft to hard modes .",
    "the expected effect of a rising trigger is somewhat more complex .",
    "increasing the parton energy will increase the likelyhood of observing punchthrough , but also the yield on the near side ( caused by next to leading fragmentation ) as compared to the away side ( cause by shockwaves ) will change with the excitation function of these mechanisms with energy .",
    "hard processes are expected to dominate at large enough scales .",
    "both the vanishing of the low @xmath1 dip ( possibly due to punchthrough ) and the drop of the away side orrelation strength compared to the near side expected from the model are qualitatively seen in the data @xcite for increased trigger and associate momentum scale . especially the fact that the away side pattern remains broad for increasing associate momentum and only drops in strength is a strong point in favour of a hydrodynamical mode , as pqcd motivated emission scenarios predict a shrinking of the angle .",
    "however quantitative regions in the transition regime between hard and soft physics are challenging and have not seriously been attempted so far .",
    "if the trigger @xmath1 is raised in the region above 6 gev , punchthrough of the away side parton through the expanding medium is observed , and the yields obtained in the model agree well with the data , cf .",
    "[ f - yield ] , except in the 4 - 6 gev away side momentum bin .",
    "this indicates that the hadron production in this region in the presence of a medium is not primarily given by fragmentation of a hard parton but that sizeable contributions of other processes are present , quite possibly recombination @xcite plays a role here .    in fig .",
    "[ f - vertex ] we show the distribution of vertices leading to a triggered hadron ( note that this distribution is also relevant for @xmath0 .",
    "while there is some degree of surface bias visible , the core of the system is by no means black and contributions to @xmath0 can come also from the core of the matter .",
    "this is in contrast to previous studies @xcite and the difference cen be traced back to the fact that the full expansion is taken into account in the present model @xcite .     +    in fig .",
    "[ f - pvertex ] we illustrate the spatial region probed in back - to - back dihadron measurements .",
    "this region shows rather large model - dependence , but is in general peaked more towards the medium center .",
    "this geometry dependence is a promising handle to gain information about the medium density distribution from dihadron correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "we have argued that @xmath0 is not sufficiently sensitive to medium properties and that more differential measurements are needed .",
    "we have presented a consistent picture of angular correlation pattern given a hard hadron trigger based on hard processes and the recoil of the soft medium . within this unified description , the correlations probe both the medium flow profile and the density distribution , thus in principle more detailed information can be gained . in practice ,",
    "more high - precision data are necessary  while it is easy to rule out toy models , the sensitivity to distinguish different dedicated bulk matter models is not yet sufficient @xcite .",
