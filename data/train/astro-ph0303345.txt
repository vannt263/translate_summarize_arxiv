    "with the exception of galaxies within a few mpc , efforts to determine the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies must be based on observations of their integrated starlight , and of the modeling of that integrated spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , establishing reliable luminosity - weighted mean ages and chemical compositions for early - type galaxies has been difficult to achieve , due primarily to the degeneracy between age and metallicity on the integrated spectra of galaxies ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) , and , secondarily , to the non - solar abundance ratios in most early - type galaxies ( e.g. , oconnell 1976 , worthey 1992 , vazdekis 1997 , trager 2000a , kuntschner 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recently improved population synthesis models and higher quality of spectra of galaxies have led to a surge of results in this field ( trager 2000a , b , kuntschner 2000 , kuntschner 2001 , vazdekis 2001 , terlevich & forbes 2002 , proctor & sansom 2002 , kuntschner 2002 ) .",
    "the need for accurate information on galaxy ages and metallicities has been underscored by rapid developments in cosmological simulations of the evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "large - scale numerical simulations of structure formation within the context of the @xmath2cdm ( i.e. , cold dark matter plus substantial contribution from a cosmological constant ) scenario , when coupled with parametrized baryonic physics , now make clear predictions as to the formation histories of early - type galaxies as a function of mass and environment @xcite .",
    "hence a comprehensive database of mean ages and metallicities of early - type galaxies covering a range in mass and environment can provide crucial constraints on the hierarchical evolution scenario that is a key component of the @xmath2cdm picture .",
    "we have recently completed a large database of integrated spectra of 175 early - type galaxies which serves two main objectives .",
    "the first goal is to observe early - type galaxies covering a large range in mass , environment , and early - type morphology .",
    "the hierarchical galaxy formation models now make predictions for the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies as a function of their mass and environment .",
    "in addition , there is an important distinction to be made between elliptical galaxies ( those galaxies without apparent ongoing star formation and without a stellar disk ) and lenticulars ( s0s : those galaxies without apparent ongoing star formation , but which do have stellar disks ) . whether these two types of galaxies have had similar origins and star formation histories , and whether there is a continuum of properties between them , is a subject of longstanding debate .",
    "a second goal is to investigate the blue spectral region , which covers the higher order balmer lines , as a promising spectral region for obtaining better decoupling between age and metallicity effects .",
    "there are two aspects in which our survey departs from previous work .",
    "the first is an emphasis on low - mass galaxies , as characterized by their low central velocity dispersion , @xmath0 .",
    "while previous surveys have tended to emphasize galaxies with @xmath0@xmath3100 , our survey contains a substantial emphasis on galaxies with lower @xmath0 .",
    "second , we have obtained wavelength coverage down to @xmath43600  , at the relatively high spectral resolution of 3.1   fwhm , which allows us to evaluate the usefulness of higher order balmer lines for age and metallicity determinations .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that will evaluate the ages and chemical compositions of early - type galaxies as a function of both mass and environment . in this paper",
    "the primary emphasis is on establishing the techniques that we use to extract luminosity - weighted mean ages and metallicities from the galaxy integrated spectra , particularly in regard to the higher order balmer lines .",
    "we present an extensive comparison between ages derived from different balmer line measurements , to test whether robust results are obtained from galaxy population synthesis .",
    "the main scientific results presented here relate to the dependence of the mean age and metallicity of early - type galaxies on the central velocity dispersion .",
    "we reserve more extensive discussions of the influence of environment and morphology for subsequent papers in the series . a brief description of the sample of galaxies and the observational data is given in  2 , while a discussion of the spectral indices used in the study is given in  3 .",
    "the techniques used to model the integrated spectra of galaxies are described in  4 . in  5 we discuss the dependence of galaxy age and metallicity on velocity dispersion , and in  6 we evaluate the results obtained from different balmer and metal features .",
    "to fully investigate the star formation histories of early - type galaxies , we have chosen our sample to cover a range in mass , morphological classification , and environment .",
    "our data sample consists of 175 early - type galaxies , 59 of which are in the virgo cluster and 116 of which are in the field or other low - density environments .",
    "the galaxies cover a central velocity dispersion range of 50 @xmath5 320 km / s , with an emphasis on low-@xmath0 galaxies , and have been previously classified as either e , s0 , ds0 , or de as indicated by their ground - based morphology . a more detailed discussion of the sample selection is given in paper ii , for the virgo galaxies , and in paper iii , for the field sample .    long slit spectra of all galaxies in the sample",
    "have been obtained at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) with the 1.5 m tillinghast telescope , the fast spectrograph and a loral 512 x 2688 pixel ccd  @xcite during twelve observing runs between 1997 september and 2002 may in seeing conditions of 2   or better .",
    "the instrumental setup was identical on all but two occasions .",
    "the dispersing element is the 600 line / mm grating which produces a spectral coverage of @xmath62000   from 3500  to 5500  at 0.75  pixel@xmath7 dispersion . using a 3  slit ,",
    "four pixel resolution is typically achieved , hence the data have a spectral resolution of 3.1  fwhm . on two of the observing runs ,",
    "the above setup differed in that a 2  slit was used , resulting in a spectral resolution of 2.14  fwhm .",
    "these observations have been smoothed to the same intrinsic resolution as the remainder of the data .",
    "spectra were extracted using a variance weighting scheme which included data along the slit down to 10% of the peak flux at a given wavelength .",
    "thus the resultant spectra represent the global spectra and refer to an isophotal area , but with larger weight given to the brighter , central regions .",
    "discussion of radial variations in the derived stellar populations will be taken up in paper ii .",
    "the data were then fluxed using standard stars observed during the same nights .    radial velocities and",
    "velocity dispersions were determined for each galaxy , using the iraf package fxcor and k0iii template stars .",
    "these are used to deredshift the spectra and to broaden them to a common resolution .",
    "the velocities and errors are listed in table  [ tab : log ] , where the errors are the internal errors produced by fxcor , and averaged from the multiple observations . a comparison with the literature values of smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for 25 galaxies in common gives a mean difference of 13 and rms of 58 .",
    "our measured velocity dispersions are in good accord with the literature values compiled by mcelroy ( 1995 ) .",
    "the dispersion errors contained in table  [ tab : log ] are the rms errors among repeated observations , but with a lower limit of 7 enforced .    for the low @xmath0 galaxies ( @xmath0@xmath180  )",
    ", our values tend to be systematically higher by about 50% than the recent values determined by simien & prugniel ( 2002 ) , pedraz ( 2002 ) , and geha ( 2002 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is due in general to our lower velocity resolution than the cited studies ( @xmath8 versus @xmath9 ) , and in certain specific cases because of our inclusion in the extracted spectra of outer parts of galaxies that are rotating , leading to broadened absorption lines .",
    "the cited works measured central broadenings , whereas we measured global broadenings . for most of our purpose , the discrepancy does not matter , since we smooth all spectra to a common velocity broadening of 230 , and instrumental / observational effects below this value are of no concern .",
    "high resolution dispersions for all the smaller galaxies would be desirable for the study of relations between dispersions and our derived stellar population parameters , but are not yet available .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] gives the log of the galaxy observations as well as basic derived parameters .",
    "although the galaxies were chosen to be free of emission contamination as based on the low s / n spectra of the cfa  i redshift survey ( huchra 1983 ) , a significant fraction of the absorption line spectra were found to suffer from the effects of emission in the balmer lines .",
    "the contamination is not completely unexpected since previous surveys have shown that 40 - 50% of e / s0 galaxies have at least small amounts of ionized gas  @xcite , but we do need to correct for this emission . to determine the quantitative impact of the fill - in on the spectral line strengths , we obtained spectra in the red , centered near h@xmath10 , for 40% of the galaxies in the sample ( 24 virgo , 45 field ) .",
    "the red spectra were taken during observing runs in 2000 february - april and 2000 september - october using a similar setup as the blue spectra , with a 3slit , covering a spectral range of 5500 - 7500and overlapping the blue spectra by @xmath650 .",
    "typically , 1 - 2 exposures , each 700 - 1200 sec in duration , were taken for each galaxy .",
    "the red spectra were reduced in the same manner as the blue spectra .",
    "the galaxies observed in the red are so indicated in column 9 of table  [ tab : log ] and were chosen from two subsets of our original data  ( i ) those galaxies with suspected emission at [ oii ] @xmath43727 and ( ii ) those galaxies whose spectra appear to be emission - free .",
    "an emission - free spectrum can be normalized and subtracted from an emission - contaminated spectrum to yield the flux in h@xmath10 and in the neighboring [ nii ] lines . the h@xmath10 information that is gained from the red spectrum",
    "can then be used to correct the bluer balmer line indices employed in the age - dating analysis .",
    "a discussion of the method used to correct for emission contamination is given in appendix a.",
    "in studying the integrated light of galaxies , our goal is to determine the distribution in age and chemical composition of the stellar populations present . given that each population of a given age and metallicity itself is a composite of stars covering a wide range in the hr diagram , the interpretation of integrated spectra has been plagued by problems of non - uniqueness . in addressing this ,",
    "observers have naturally been driven in two conflicting directions .",
    "one is to observe the entire spectral energy distribution , hence at low resolution and with a wide slit , to best sample the contributions from all types of stars .",
    "the other is to work at higher spectral resolution and a narrow slit , to measure the strengths of specific absorption features which , by having primary sensitivity to one particular atmospheric parameter ( e.g. , t@xmath11 ) , can help solve the non - uniqueness problem .",
    "both methods supply important constraints to the analysis of integrated light . in what follows",
    "we exclusively rely on higher resolution spectroscopy , with emphasis on specific spectral features relevant to resolving non - uniqueness issues .",
    "in measuring the strengths of specific absorption features there is again a tradeoff between low and high resolution approaches . to obtain a robust result for the equivalent width of an absorption line requires a determination of the continuum at a sufficient distance from the line center so that the wings of the feature are excluded , while the measurement of the feature itself must include both the line core and wings .",
    "such an approach forms the basis of the lick index system ( e.g. , @xcite and described in detail in @xcite ) , in which indices are defined by measuring the flux in the line bandpass and subtracting it from a continuum formed by connecting a straight line between the average flux in red and blue sidebands . while the traditional lick indices primarily concentrate on prominent metal features in the red and on h@xmath12 ( see @xcite for a complete list ) , several new lick - style indices were defined in @xcite which concentrate on the higher order balmer lines of h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 .",
    "the disadvantage of the relatively broad bandpass system is the contamination of both the line and continuum bandpasses with unwanted features which can complicate the interpretation of the resultant spectral index .",
    "hence an alternative approach is to narrow both line and continuum bandpasses sufficiently to obtain the cleanest possible measurements of both line and ( pseudo)-continuum .",
    "this approach has been utilized in @xcite and @xcite in defining indices that are narrowly focussed on , e.g. , h@xmath13 or the fe i@xmath44045 iron feature . while minimizing the contribution from unwanted features , this method has two disadvantages .",
    "first , by narrowing the line measurement , only the core is included , hence the method loses sensitivity if significant wings are present .",
    "moreover , a decrease in spectral resolution , due to instrumental or velocity broadening effects , will redistribute the flux deficit in the line core out into the wings , where the pseudocontinuum `` sidebands '' are defined .",
    "the result is that slight changes in spectral resolution can lead to large changes in the measured strength of the line feature , thereby making it critical to determine and account for this spectral resolution effect .",
    "more recently , @xcite and vazdekis ( 2001a , b ) have addressed this problem in the case of a narrow band h@xmath13 index in which the location of the line and pseudocontinuum bandpasses have been carefully selected so as to minimize the effect of spectral resolution on the index measurement .",
    "the result is a more robust definition of h@xmath13 , but which also requires high precision in the wavelength scale so as to measure the correct line and continuum intervals .    a third approach to the problem , originally formulated in @xcite , and used subsequently in , e.g.",
    ", @xcite and @xcite , is to maximize the contribution from the feature of interest by measuring the residual central intensity in the line , and that in a neighboring reference line , and forming the ratio of these two quantities . by using the deepest part of the spectral lines in the two features , the maximum contrast with other contaminating absorption lines",
    "is achieved .",
    "in addition , the line ratio index is defined without reference to the ( pseudo)-continuum level , which is generally problematic to locate , especially at bluer wavelengths where line crowding is such a problem . moreover , since both line centers tend to be similarly affected by a change in spectral resolution , the line ratio indices are not strongly sensitive to resolution effects . a disadvantage to this method",
    "is that the index loses sensitivity if one of the lines saturates in the core , a problem that is a particular issue in younger populations , where the balmer lines become strong .",
    "a further problem is that the indices all consist of relative measurements of one feature against another , and thus can not provide the equivalent width measurement of a single feature that is ideal for resolving the degeneracy between age and metallicity effects .    in this paper",
    "we utilize the well - studied lick index system for the red spectral region , in particular for characterizing the strength of h@xmath12 .",
    "although we use the standard lick index definitions ( worthey 1994 ) , our index measurements _ have not been calibrated to the lick / ids system _ , since that would require further smoothing of our data as well as transformation onto the lick / ids instrumental response system . for the higher order balmer lines in the blue , where the line crowding is more extreme , we switch primarily to the line ratio indices of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we make extensive use of the hn / fe index / fe4045+@xmath15/fe4325+h8/fe3859@xmath3 ] which has the advantage of averaging three higher - order balmer line to nearby iron line ratios , and which was first shown to be an effective age indicator in  @xcite . altogether",
    ", we measure a total of 30 spectral indices  15 lick equivalent width indices , 3 high - resolution equivalent width indices , and 12 line ratio indices .",
    "we do not utilize the @xcite h@xmath17 index in this paper , due to the high velocity dispersion of many of the galaxies in our sample , but reserve it for a future paper , in which we examine the low velocity dispersion virgo galaxies .    to readily compare the observed galaxy spectral indices with those produced by the evolutionary synthesis models , we broadened all of the galaxy spectra to a common effective velocity dispersion of 230 .",
    "consequently , we have excised from the discussion in this paper all galaxies with @xmath0@xmath3230 and leave them for a future discussion .",
    "this somewhat arbitrary cutoff was arrived at as a compromise between desiring to preserve as much dynamic range as possible in the blue indices while also including as many galaxies as possible in the discussion .",
    "the removal of of the high @xmath0 galaxies reduces our sample to 56 virgo galaxies and 97 field galaxies .      the spectral indices discussed above are all measured with a single , convenient fortran program written by alexandre vazdekis and publicly available on his website .",
    "to determine the uncertainties in each spectral index , we use a weighted combination of the rms in the individual galaxy measurements as outlined in paper i ; a brief review of the process is given here .",
    "first , the spectral index is measured for each of the individual galaxy exposures , typically 2 - 4 for each object , and the standard deviation of these values is determined . since the rms among individual exposures is particularly unreliable for those galaxies which have only two observations , we utilize the standard deviations in all indices for all galaxies in the following manner . for a particular galaxy , _ i _ , the error @xmath18 in index _",
    "j _ , where there are a total of _ m _ indices and _ n _ galaxies , is given by :    @xmath19    0.6 cm where @xmath20 is the average over all galaxies of the standard deviation in the @xmath21 index , @xmath22 is the average of the standard deviations of all indices of the same type ( i.e , all lick indices or all line ratios indices ) for the @xmath23 galaxy , and @xmath24 is the average standard deviation in all indices of the same type for all galaxies in the sample .",
    "thus , in effect , by using all of the spectral index error information , we have found the average error for each index , and weighted those errors by the relative mean error in all indices for a particular galaxy compared to the mean error over the whole sample .",
    "for the two galaxies in our sample for which we have only one observation , the above process is still followed , except that the standard deviation in each index is taken to be the mean rms in that index for galaxies with comparable signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "early - type galaxies normally contain much less ionized gas and dust than spiral galaxies .",
    "however , spectroscopic surveys have revealed that nearly 40 - 50% of ellipticals do have at least some weak optical emission  @xcite .",
    "if emission lines _ are _ present in the galaxy spectrum  from either ionized gas in hii regions , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and/or planetary nebulae  the measured absorption line indices may be severely affected . in the case of the balmer lines ,",
    "emission fill - in can weaken the line strength and lead to older derived ages .",
    "thus , a potential source of systematic error in the measurement of the spectral line indices comes from the contamination of the absorption feature by fill - in from emission lines .",
    "the method that we follow to detect and remove contamination of the absorption features from superimposed emission is discussed in appendix a.      in table  [ tab : listind ] we list all of the spectral indices measured by us for each galaxy . in the first column the spectral index is given , and in the second column a reference is given to the paper in which the index is defined .",
    "the full table of spectral indices , and the errors in those indices , is listed electronically in table  [ tab : indices ] . to clarify matters , in the third column of table  [ tab : listind ] we list the column number in table  [ tab : indices ] in which a particular index appears .",
    "each index in table  [ tab : indices ] is followed by its @xmath251@xmath0 error .",
    "many of the indices in table  [ tab : indices ] have been corrected for emission contamination ( in the balmer lines ) and/or for the effects of non - solar abundance ratios ( see  [ sec : nsar ] ) . as a guide to the amount of correction that has been applied , in the second to last column in table  [ tab : indices ] we give the correction that has been made to the lick h@xmath12 index for emission fill - in , and in the last column we give the correction applied to the h@xmath12 index to account for non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "the information extracted from the spectral indices defined in the previous section must still be translated into mean ages and metallicities of the integrated stellar population through the use of population synthesis models . in these models ,",
    "a theoretical stellar evolutionary isochrone is computed for a given population representing a unique age and metallicity , hereafter referred to as a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "each point along the isochrone represents a specific star of known temperature , luminosity and surface gravity which produces a specific set of absorption lines .",
    "the spectral line strengths for each point along the isochrone are weighted by the stellar luminosity and the number of stars expected at that point ( from the computed luminosity function ) and then added to derive the total line strength for the integrated population . by computing the expected integrated line strength for ssps covering a range of ages and metallicities , the spectral indices from the galaxies can be compared to the predicted values , and , the luminosity - weighted mean age and metallicity of the galaxy can be determined .",
    "while the sophistication of the evolutionary population synthesis models that supply the framework for interpreting the integrated light of galaxies has increased substantially in the last few years , the current generation of models still has its uncertainties .",
    "there are a variety of issues including : uncertainties in the model isochrones ( with inadequate understanding of convection and of mass loss being the chief culprits ) , uncertainties in transforming from the theoretical h - r diagram into an observational plane ( with the t@xmath11 scale providing a major problem ) , inadequate coverage in empirical stellar libraries , uncertainties in the accuracy of model stellar atmospheres and synthetic spectra , and uncertainties in the treatment of non - solar abundance ratios . additionally , the population models assume a single age and metallicity for the entire galaxy stellar population while a galaxy is most likely a composite of different populations . as a result of the uncertainties in the models , we place primary emphasis on using the models to determine the _ relative _ ages of galaxies , rather than their _ absolute _ ages . in the present section ,",
    "the components and implementation of the population models are described , followed by a comparison of the models used in this work to other available synthesis models .      for our analysis",
    ", we use a modified version of the population synthesis models originally introduced in  @xcite . the worthey ( 1994 , hereafter w94 ) models depend on two adjustable parameters  the metallicity and single - burst age of the stellar population  and one fixed parameter , the imf exponent , here chosen to be the salpeter value .",
    "the basic ideas behind the models are reviewed briefly , and the reader is referred to w94 for more details .    to assemble the theoretical integrated spectrum ,",
    "the models incorporate three ingredients : stellar evolutionary isochrones , a stellar sed library , and a library of absorption line strengths .",
    "for the evolutionary information , the modified w94 models use the isochrones of the padova group  @xcite which have been computed for six metallicities in the range -1.7 @xmath1 [ z / h ] @xmath1 + 0.4 and for 29 ages from 0.004 to 19 gyr .",
    "the stellar sed library was constructed using the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra of  @xcite for stars hotter than 3750k and the model seds of  @xcite and observed seds from  @xcite for cooler m giants .",
    "ideally , the spectral line strengths should be determined from a single observed library of stellar spectra which fully sample the entire range of atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath11 , log  g , and [ z / h ] ) . since the galactic star formation and chemical enrichment history excludes some regions of the atmospheric parameter space , especially metal - poor high - gravity stars , we have chosen to combine libraries of both empirical and synthetic spectra to fully cover the line strengths along each isochrone .      for the empirical spectral library",
    ", we use a set of high - resolution stellar spectra compiled by l.  jones ( 1999 ; see also leitherer 1996 ) , which are well - suited for stellar population analysis .",
    "the library consists of two spectral regions  one in the blue covering the wavelength range @xmath43820 - 4509   and one in the red covering @xmath44780 - 5469   for each of 684 stars .",
    "the spectra were taken with the kpno coud feed telescope and spectrograph and have a pixel sampling of 0.62  pixel@xmath7 with a spectral resolution of 1.8fwhm .",
    "because the stellar library is primarily drawn from the local solar neighborhood , all areas of the log  g-[fe / h]-log t@xmath11 grid are not equally covered .",
    "specifically , the grid is relatively well - populated for cool stars ( t@xmath26 6000 ) , but at higher temperatures , it has a much more limited coverage due to the lack of hot , metal - poor and hot , low - gravity stars . to ensure adequate sampling throughout the parameter space ,",
    "we restrict our use of the empirical library to stars in the temperature range 3750 - 6300k .",
    "further stars were eliminated from the library if they are observed to have chromospheric emission ( which contaminates the absorption line indices ) or if their atmospheric parameters are either undetermined or are in striking disagreement with their measured spectral indices . in all , 547 stars are used from the empirical library .    the empirical spectral library is incorporated into the population synthesis models through polynomial fitting functions which describe how the absorption line strength varies as a function of the effective temperature , gravity and metallicity of the stars .",
    "to produce the fitting functions , we employed a fortran program kindly provided by g. worthey .",
    "the program uses a series of least - squares regressions to fit a third order polynomial in @xmath27=5040/t@xmath11 , [ fe / h ] , and log  g. through an iterative procedure , the terms in the polynomials are either included or excluded until no systematic trends appear in the residuals of atmospheric parameters versus the fit .",
    "stars with very deviant index values are excluded from the fits , unless they are in regions of particularly poor coverage ( e.g. , very low metallicity ) . each absorption line used in the spectral indices",
    "is fitted with one polynomial across the entire temperature range , 3500 - 6300k .",
    "due to the lack of hot , unevolved metal - poor stars in the galaxy , the coud feed spectral library ( cfsl ) only has adequate metallicity coverage for temperatures less than 7000k . to compensate for this shortcoming in the coud feed library , the empirical spectra",
    "are augmented with 2103 synthetic spectra generated with the r. kurucz synthe program using the kurucz atlas model atmospheres  @xcite , both kindly provided by r. kurucz .",
    "a complete description of the construction of the synthetic spectra is given in  @xcite .",
    "briefly stated , the synthe program generates a synthetic spectrum at high resolution ( 0.1  pix@xmath7 ) from a given model atmosphere and line list . the synthe spectrum is then rebinned and smoothed to match that of the observations .",
    "the synthetic library covers the wavelength range @xmath43500 - 5500   and covers the 3-dimensional parameter space of log  g , [ fe / h ] and t@xmath11 ( see table  4 of @xcite for the specific coverage ) . because the synthetic spectra are subject neither to observational errors nor to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters , the calculated line strengths of the synthe stars evolve systematically with the atmospheric parameters , and there is no need to fit them with polynomial functions . instead",
    ", the synthetic spectra are incorporated into the population synthesis models through linear interpolation between the grid points for a given set of atmospheric parameters . for points outside the synthe parameter grid ,",
    "the line strength corresponding to the nearest grid point is used .",
    "it is , of course , important that there be no strong discontinuity in line strength across the 6000k boundary in temperature between the empirical cool star spectra and the synthetic hot star spectra .",
    "the agreement between the empirical and the synthetic data is in general reasonably good in the region of overlapping temperature .",
    "we plot an example of the interface between synthetic and empirical spectra for the h@xmath14 feature in figure  [ coude - syn ] .      before using the population models to interpret the integrated light of the galaxies , it is important to ensure that all of the model ingredients are smoothed to the same spectral broadening as the galaxy data .",
    "the spectra in the coud feed library were observed at an intrinsic spectral resolution of @xmath61.8   fwhm whereas the flwo galaxy spectra are at a resolution of @xmath63.1  . to put the two datasets on the same scale",
    ", the coud spectra are convolved with a gaussian of @xmath0 = 0.97  . to determine the amount of broadening required to match the synthe and flwo spectra , a synthetic spectrum was chosen with the appropriate atmospheric parameters of a star observed with the same configuration as the galaxy spectra .",
    "the synthe spectrum was then broadened by various gaussians ranging from 0.2 to 6.0 pixels , each of the broadened spectra were cross - correlated with the original spectrum , and the relationship between the fwhm of the cross - correlation peak and the amount of smoothing was determined . using this relationship , the amount of broadening required to match the synthe spectra with the flwo spectra was found to be @xmath0 = 0.24  .",
    "after both stellar libraries were smoothed to the same intrinsic spectral resolution as the galaxy data , they were then smoothed by an additional amount to match the effective galaxy broadening of 230 ( recall that all final galaxy spectra are broadened to a common velocity dispersion of 230 ) . at this point , both the empirical and synthetic libraries and the galaxy data are all at a common spectral resolution .    upon implementation , the population synthesis models combine the information from the padova isochrones , the kurucz sed fluxes and the library line strengths to create a theoretical integrated population of a specified age and metallicity .",
    "to assemble the integrated spectrum , the absorption line strengths are weighted by the number and luminosity of stars at that isochrone point and are superposed on the continuum that has been formed by the appropriate weighting of each sed .",
    "as the models integrate along the distribution of stars , the line strengths for isochrone points cooler than 6000k are calculated from the empirical fitting functions ( where the coud feed library coverage is complete ) and from interpolating in the synthe line strength grid for stars hotter than 6000k .",
    "the ultimate results of the w94 population models are integrated absorption line strengths , which can be translated into the various spectral indices described in @xmath283 . for each spectral index we calculate a grid of model values at a series of ages and metallicities . by choosing an appropriate pair of indices",
    ", the galaxy data can be over - plotted on the index - index model grids , and the age and metallicity of the stellar population can be determined .",
    "since the derived ages depend on the model grids against which they are measured , an important gauge is to compare the index - index grids produced by different synthesis models .",
    "thus , as a check of our implementation of the w94 models , and hence our interpretation of the early - type galaxy spectra , we compare our model grids to those produced by the publicly available population synthesis models of a. vazdekis ( vazdekis 1999 , v99 ) .",
    "the vazdekis models are similar to the updated w94 models in that they both use the set of evolutionary isochrones produced by the padova group ( e.g , bertelli et al .",

    "to do so , a primarily metallicity sensitive index ( e.g. , fe5270 ) is plotted against a primarily age sensitive index ( e.g. , h@xmath12 ) for a range of ssp model predictions producing a largely orthogonal grid of ages and metallicities . by over - plotting",

    "an additional complication in deriving the galaxy ages and metallicities is that , as seen in figure  [ fig : hb - fe ] , not all galaxies lie within the model predictions .",
    "this may be due to observational errors , residual emission contamination in the balmer line indices ( see  [ sec : emiss - cont ] ) , differing abundance ratios in the galaxies and the model components ( addressed in  [ sec : nsar ] ) , and/or zero - point offsets in the population models .    to extract the age and metallicity of a galaxy from a particular index - index diagram ,",
    "the four model grid points which form a box encompassing the data point are found . using the four corners of the surrounding box , the lines of constant age and metallicity which pass through the data point are determined , and the age and metallicity values are interpolated along the constant metallicity and age lines . for galaxies which lie outside the model grids ,",
    "the population values are extrapolated only in the cases where the the extrapolation is small and reliable . because the metallicity tracks tend to be evenly spaced , extrapolation of the galaxy metallicity is relatively stable . on the other hand ,",

    ", evidence has mounted that the abundance ratios in early - type galaxies are often non - solar and that the mg / fe abundance ratio , in particular , is larger in more luminous early - type galaxies than in solar - neighborhood stars ( oconnell 1976 , peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber & gonzalez 1992 ; vazdekis et al 1997 ) .",
    "the population synthesis models are built using spectral databases of solar neighborhood stars , which reflect the specific pattern of the chemical enrichment of our galaxy .",
    "in addition , the theoretical isochrones that are used as the backbone of evolutionary synthesis modeling are based on solar abundance ratios .",
    "hence for galaxies with elemental abundance ratios deviating from that found in the solar neighborhood , there are additional corrections to be made in modeling their luminosity - weighted mean ages and chemical compositions .",
    "recent population synthesis modeling is now beginning to simulate the effect of non - solar abundance ratios ( nsar ) @xcite , based on theoretical isochrones incorporating non - solar abundance ratios @xcite and on the synthetic spectral modeling of key spectral indicators carried out by @xcite . in appendix b we describe how the effects of nsar are accounted for , following the prescriptions developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to combine the galaxy spectral index data , described in  3 , with the modeling procedures , described in  4 , to determine luminosity - weighted mean ages and metallicities for our early - type galaxy sample .",
    "there will be two main goals for the discussion in this section and in  6 .",
    "first , in this section we demonstrate that there is a trend in the mean ages of early - type galaxies with velocity dispersion , in the sense that low-@xmath0 galaxies have younger mean ages than their higher-@xmath0 ( i.e. , more massive ) counterparts .",
    "in establishing this result we will evaluate several potential sources of systematic error in age determinations , namely , `` contamination '' from a metal - poor population and/or from a red horizontal branch ( rhb ) population , `` contamination '' from emission lines , and the effect of non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "the second goal , discussed in  6 , is to compare results obtained from different balmer and metal line indicators , and to evaluate whether robust and consistent ages and abundances emerge when different diagnostic spectral features are employed .",
    "we begin by illustrating the large range in spectral behavior that is evident in our galaxy sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] , we plot representative examples of low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 galaxies , concentrating on the spectral region containing h@xmath14 at 4101   and h@xmath13 at 4340  , as well as h8 at 3888  .",
    "these spectra are shown at their observed spectral broadenings . from their appearance , it is clear that the low @xmath0 galaxies have a much wider range in balmer line strength , and that the increase in balmer line strength in the galaxies from top to bottom in the figure is systematic across all balmer lines .",
    "hereinafter , the data we discuss , either in the form of spectra or indices , have been smoothed to a common velocity dispersion of 230 , emission corrected ( see appendix a ) , and corrected for nsar where applicable ( see appendix b ) . a quantitative representation of the variation in line strength among our early - type galaxy spectra is given in fig .",
    "[ bces ] , where the behavior of four spectral indicators as a function of galaxy velocity dispersion is plotted .",
    "the two right hand panels characterize the behavior of the metal features mg@xmath32 and fe5270 from the lick system .",
    "the upper and lower left hand panels plot the behavior of the balmer - sensitive indices h@xmath12 and hn / fe .",
    "note that for the two balmer line strength indices the balmer strength is plotted so as to increase from top to bottom . as defined in  3",
    ", the hn / fe index is an average value for the line ratios of h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , and h8 ( at 3888  ) to neighboring metal lines .",
    "plotted with the galaxy data in fig .",
    "[ bces ] are the regression line fits to the indices as a function of log @xmath0 .",
    "the fits were determined using the bces ( bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ) method of akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) for the higher @xmath0 galaxies ( with log @xmath0 @xmath3 2.0 , the outliers were exluded from the fit ) , and then extrapolated to lower @xmath0 .",
    "the application of the bces method is further described in @xcite .",
    "there are two key features to note in fig .",
    "first , while the metal - sensitive mg@xmath32 and fe 5270 indices exhibit a relatively constant and symmetric scatter at all velocity dispersions , the two balmer line indices show a striking increase in scatter for log @xmath0 @xmath1 2 .",
    "second , the large scatter at low log @xmath0 is asymmetric , with many galaxies having high balmer line strengths .",
    "as is previously described in @xcite , we have extracted the _ intrinsic _ scatter in the indices from the _ observed _ scatter , and the intrinsic scatter at high and low log @xmath0 is denoted by the two vertical arrows in the lower right corner of each plot .",
    "the results of the intrinsic scatter measurements are summarized in table  [ tab : inscat ] .",
    "there we have divided the galaxy sample into low- and high-@xmath0 bins . for each index",
    "we give the derived intrinsic scatter in the index as well as the @xmath251@xmath0 uncertainty in the intrinsic scatter , first for the uncorrected indices , then for emission - corrected indices , and finally for indices corrected both for emission and for nsar . the number in parentheses below the uncorrected value represents the median observational error for the index .",
    "since different indices are measured in different ways , the ratio in intrinsic scatter between low- and high-@xmath0 samples provides the clearest assessment of the dependence of spectral index behavior on velocity dispersion .",
    "while that ratio is only 1.8 and 2.0 for mg@xmath32 and fe5270 , respectively , in the final ( i.e. , emission - corrected and nsar - corrected ) indices , it is 2.8 and 4.0 for h@xmath12 and hn / fe , thus underscoring that the large intrinsic scatter in low-@xmath0 galaxies is more pronounced in the balmer lines . while the scatter in indices at low @xmath0 is large , a clearly measurable intrinsic scatter is also evident at high @xmath0 .",
    "we return to this fact in  [ sec : inscatter ] .",
    "we have recalculated the statistics using the lower velocity dispersions from the literature , where available (  2 . ) , and found no significant change .",
    "perhaps when all of these lower mass galaxies have precise dispersions measured some of the details of the scatter calculations may change , but the main results that the scatter is due to age variations will likely not change .",
    "@xcite proposed that the large intrinsic scatter in the balmer lines is due primarily to a range in age that is particularly pronounced among the lower @xmath0 galaxies . with the population synthesis models and technique established in the previous sections",
    ", we now evaluate that assertion .      the distribution of galaxies in luminosity - weighted mean age and metallicity can be assessed by plotting the combination of a primarily age - sensitive balmer index versus a primarily metal - sensitive index .",
    "to begin , we plot the metal - sensitive fe4383 index from the lick system versus the balmer - sensitive hn / fe index in fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] .",
    "the galaxy data have been corrected for emission , and have been subdivided into four different velocity dispersion bins .",
    "the data are superposed on grid lines of ssps of constant age and metallicity as determined from the worthey models described in  4 . for comparison with more familiar plots of this kind , fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] is similar in nature to the log h@xmath12 versus log @xmath1fe@xmath3 plot in , e.g. , figure 1(b ) of trager et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , except that here the balmer index is on the x - axis . a striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] is that the two groups with low @xmath0 have a lower mean age than does the highest @xmath0 group ( log @xmath332.2 ) , while the galaxies with 2.0@xmath1log @xmath0@xmath12.2 show an intermediate distribution in age .",
    "in short , the increased scatter in hn / fe seen among the low @xmath0 galaxies ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] ) is indeed reflected in an increased trend towards younger ages . in table",
    "[ tab : agesum ] we summarize data on the mean age , and dispersion in age , for each of the four log  @xmath0 groups .",
    "the age dispersions listed there have not been corrected for observational error .",
    "note that the rms scatter in age is actually _ lower _ among the low @xmath0 galaxies than for the high @xmath0 galaxies , which may seem surprising , given the greatly _ increased _ rms scatter in balmer line strength for the low @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this result simply reflects the highly non - linear dependence of balmer line strength on age , coupled with the pronounced trend to younger mean ages among the low @xmath0 galaxies .    another important aspect of fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] is the fact that 47 tuc lies separated from virtually all galaxies in the diagram .",
    "clearly , no galaxy in our sample is similar to 47 tuc , which supplies a well - defined empirical anchor point at an age of @xmath612 - 13 gyr @xcite and [ fe / h]@xmath6 - 0.7 - -0.8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large discrepancy between isochrone - based ssp models and the location of 47 tuc has been pointed out in previous work ( gibson et al . 1999 ) . through a combination of the inclusion of @xmath10-element enhancement and diffusion to the models @xcite , along with adjustments to the t@xmath11 scale for metal - poor giants and , most importantly , to the failure of model isochrones to produce sufficient numbers of stars above the hb level ( schiavon et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , the most recent models now reproduce the position of 47 tuc in many diagnostic diagrams .",
    "however , the key point is that , independent of zero - point problems with the models , no galaxies are found with the old age and low metallicity of 47 tuc .",
    "despite the fact that 47 tuc shares the same b - v color as a typical e / s0 galaxy ( e.g. , m32 ) their mean ages and chemical compositions are quite distinct .",
    "the systematic differences in absorption line indices between 47 tuc and m32 have been previously analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the mean age and the scatter in age vary substantially with velocity dispersion , there is , on the other hand , relatively little change in metallicity , as designated by the iron - sensitive fe5270 feature .",
    "it is also worthy of note that m32 ( designated by the large square ) is found among the highest [ fe / h ] objects in the sample .",
    "one should bear in mind that in m32 we are sampling only the central @xmath610 pc of the galaxy , thus it is not clear how relevant the comparison is with the more widespread central region spectra of the other galaxies in the sample .    to quantify the appearance of different mean ages for the four log  @xmath0 groups in fig .

    "the two discrepant data points in the @xmath34 log  @xmath0 @xmath35 group have been excluded from the test . with the one exception of the two lowest @xmath0 groups ,",
    "the likelihood that the age distributions of any two log @xmath0 groups are drawn from the same parent population is small . in the case of the two lowest @xmath0 bins ,",
    "the probability is high that their age distributions are similar .    to further emphasize that the intrinsic scatter in balmer line strength found in fig .",

    "the right hand panels show the galaxies coded by metallicity , where the [ fe / h ] values also come from interpolation in fig .",

    "[ fig : mgb - agemet ] , a trend still exists in the sense that at a given log @xmath0 , a lower mg  @xmath31 correlates with lower age .",
    "however , the effect is now subtler for this metallicity feature than for the more age - sensitive balmer index .",
    "although we do not show them here , similar results are found for plots of both h@xmath12 and fe5270 versus log @xmath0 , in that h@xmath12 closely follows the trends seen in hn / fe while the behavior of fe5270 is similar to that of mg  @xmath31 .    while the above discussion strongly indicates that there is a considerable spread in age among early - type galaxies , in particular a trend to young ages at low @xmath0",
    ", two questions need to be addressed at this point .",
    "first , could some type of systematic effect lead to a spurious conclusion of young ages in galaxies ?",
    "second , the ages we have presented are based on a single pair of spectral indices ; are consistent results obtained with other spectral indicators ?",
    "we first consider several systematic effects that could , in principle , lead to incorrect age determinations , and then in  6 we evaluate the degree to which different balmer and metal features produce consistent results .        it has been pointed out in the past that the inability to model the integrated spectrum of early - type galaxies such as m32 with a single old - age ssp does not necessarily imply the existence of intermediate - age stars .",
    "instead , one can argue for multiple metallicity components in these galaxies .",
    "this approach has been advocated most recently by maraston & thomas ( 2000 ) , who propose that the enhanced balmer absorption lines found in many early - type galaxies can be reproduced by adding in an old metal - poor population , rather than resorting to intermediate - age populations .",
    "since it is indeed crucial to distinguish between the intermediate - age and metal - poor population scenarios , we now address that degeneracy .    as has been described in rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) , leonardi & rose ( 1996 ) , leonardi & worthey ( 2000 ) , and @xcite , the line ratio index composed of the ca ii h + h@xmath36 and ca",
    "ii k lines ( hereafter referred to as the ca ii index ) provides a sensitive test for the presence of early - type stars in an integrated spectrum , whether they come from young upper main sequence stars , blue stragglers , horizontal branch stars , or main sequence turnoff stars from a metal - poor population .",
    "the key idea is that for all cool stars the ca ii h and k line cores are saturated and insensitive to temperature , thus the line ratio is constant in cool stars . only in stars",
    "hotter than early f does this ratio change , once the line cores are no longer saturated , and , once h@xmath36 , whose line center coincides with ca ii h , also begins to make a significant contribution .",
    "thus the ca ii index provides a sensitive lever for detecting small amounts of hot stars in the integrated light .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfevcaii_m15 ] we plot the ca ii index versus hn / fe , for the highest and lowest @xmath0 galaxies in our sample ( in the previous references , ca ii has been plotted against h@xmath14/fe4045 , rather than hn / fe ) , along with the model age and metallicity grid lines .",
    "note that the worthey models all arrive at an asymptotic value of @xmath61.2 for old age populations , independent of metallicity . the globular cluster 47 tuc indeed lies just slightly below this old age value , which is consistent with a @xmath61 - 2% contribution from blue stragglers at 4000   predicted by the color - magnitude diagram of its core region ( howell , guhathakurta , & gilliland 2000 ; ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) . on average , even the oldest galaxies in our sample are displaced by @xmath60.05 below the old - age value , and the previously identified young galaxies have low ca ii indices , consistent with ages below 2 gyr .    as was pointed out by rose ( 1985 ) in the case of m32",
    ", the @xmath60.05 discrepancy between the ca ii index of m32 and the cool star value can be accounted for by introducing either a small component of very young stars , blue stragglers , or a metal - poor component . in the latter case , which appears to be most plausible ,",
    "given the inevitable existence of a metal - poor component in a chemically enriched galaxy , the ca ii discrepancy in m32 can be reproduced by adding in a @xmath67.5% contribution to the integrated light at 4000   from a metal - poor globular cluster spectrum .",
    "in fact , such a contribution is expected in the case of a closed box model ( rose 1985 ) and is in concert with the near - uv synthesis of m32 performed by kjaergaard ( 1987 ) .",
    "we reproduce the effect of this metal - poor contribution in fig .  [",
    "fig : hnfevcaii_m15 ] .",
    "the large squares show the result of subtracting off varying amounts of light from m32 in the form of an integrated spectrum of the metal - poor galactic globular cluster m15 , smoothed to the same resolution as the fast data . specifically , the sequence of squares , moving away from the open square representing m32 , are the results of subtracting 5% , 10% , 20% , and 30% of the light respectively .",
    "the key point is that if one tries to weaken the balmer lines of m32 by removing the metal - poor component , one very quickly comes into conflict with the old - age value of the ca ii index .",
    "that is , the ca ii index is quickly affected by the subtraction of hot stars , because those stars have unsaturated ca ii lines .",
    "removing @xmath67 - 8% of the light of m32 in the form of an m15 spectrum brings the ca ii index in concert with that of 47 tuc , but only reduces the hn / fe index by a small amount ( 0.009 ) . to displace m32 in hn / fe by the amount required to give it an old age in the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] , i.e. , @xmath60.08 in hn / fe , requires well in excess of 30% of the light coming from an m15 component , which is in strong violation of the ca ii criterion .",
    "it has also been proposed recently that the strong balmer lines in m32 and some other early - type galaxies can be reproduced by adding in a component of extreme horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , other hot stars in advanced evolutionary stages ( de propris 2000 ) , and/or a population of hot blue stragglers . again",
    ", either scenario avoids the necessity for intermediate ages .",
    "while we do not reproduce the specifics here , rose ( 1985 ) placed upper limits of only a few percent of the light in m32 coming from @xmath37 type of hot population , again based on the observed ca ii index . in short , the stringent limit on hot star light placed by the ca ii index definitely rules out the possibility that the enhanced balmer lines in galaxies such as m32 can be ascribed to a population of hot stars , rather than to an intermediate age population .    in short , a small metal - poor contribution to the integrated light of early - type galaxies",
    "is indicated by the position of these galaxies in the ca ii versus hn / fe diagram .",
    "removal of this apparently uniform contribution of @xmath67% at 4000   will slightly increase the derived ages for all of the galaxies .",
    "however , the inferred age increase is small , and does not account for the galaxies , such as m32 , with intermediate and young ages .",
    "the amount of age adjustment , naturally , is a function of the age of the galaxy , since the age lines crowd together at higher age , and also the contribution of the underlying metal - poor component will vary with age , due to the systematically brighter main - sequence turn off ( msto ) of a younger component . in the case of m32 , the adjustment amounts to @xmath61  gyr . because the emphasis in this paper is on the age @xmath38 , rather than @xmath39 , and because correcting for a uniform metal - poor component will result in a systematic age shift , thus hardly affecting the age distribution , we do not choose to make that correction here .",
    "the enhanced balmer lines which lead to young age estimates for galaxies such as m32 in metal versus balmer line diagrams can in principle be due to a population of red horizontal - branch ( rhb ) stars .",
    "these stars would be cool enough to have the ca ii index of a typical late - type star , but hotter than the msto of an old population .",
    "for example , the bluest rhb stars in 47 tuc approach these characteristics . to assess this possibility , we rely on spectral indices , described extensively by rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) , which are sensitive to surface gravity , and hence can be used to determine the relative contribution of dwarf and evolved stars to the integrated spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "specifically , the two spectral indices used form the ratio of the singly ionized sr ii@xmath44077 feature to the neutral @xmath44063 fe i feature ( the srii@xmath44077 index ) and the ratio of h@xmath14 to fe i@xmath44063 ( the h@xmath404063 index ) . in fig .  [ fig : hd63vsr63 ] we plot a sub - sample of galaxies in the surface gravity dependent srii@xmath44077 versus h@xmath404063 diagram .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the mean relations for dwarfs and giants respectively , determined from the behavior of stars in the coud feed spectral library . as has been discussed in rose ( 1985 , 1994 )",
    "the separation of dwarfs and giants in this diagram is independent of metal - abundance , except in the case of the most metal - deficient stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1.5 ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd63vsr63 ] , the galactic globular cluster 47 tuc lies between the dwarf and giant sequences , in fact close enough to the giant sequence to indicate that @xmath62/3 of its integrated light at 4000   comes from evolved stars , which is in accord with its observed color - magnitude diagram ( schiavon 2002a , b ) .",
    "in contrast , m32 lies close to the dwarf sequence , thereby ruling out the possibility that rhb stars are making a significant contribution .",
    "hence the enhanced balmer lines are indeed due to an intermediate age population .",
    "it is also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd63vsr63 ] that the other galaxies in the sample are clustered around the dwarf relation , thus the same conclusion should be drawn that rhb stars are not an important issue in early - type galaxies .",
    "note that since the fe i@xmath44063 line is used in both indices , we can expect the galaxy index errors in the plot to be correlated .",
    "the left arrow in the plot shows the expected direction of the correlated errors .",
    "contamination of the stellar absorption spectrum by emission is clearly a potential source of systematic error in age determinations .",
    "the most serious effect of a superposed emission spectrum is to fill in the balmer absorption lines , thereby causing the galaxy age to be overestimated .",
    "thus , varying amounts of emission fill - in , if not accounted for , can lead to a spurious spread in derived ages , in the sense that an emission - induced spread to older ages is produced .",
    "note that this effect will only produce younger ages if an _",
    "overcorrection _ is made for emission .    in  3.3 and in appendix a we discussed the strategy for identifying and removing the effect of emission in our sample of early - type galaxy spectra .",
    "as described there , we either remove the emission , based on a determination of h@xmath10 emission from supplementary red spectra , or use the [ oii]@xmath43727 line , along with an assumed [ oii]@xmath43727/h@xmath10 ratio , to estimate the emission correction .",

    "we have followed the prescription described in appendix b , which follows that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the primary effect , as expected , is to increase the overall heavy element abundance derived from the fe5270 index , since iron is found to be underabundant , relative to magnesium , in early - type galaxies .",
    "we do not have prescriptions for correcting either the fe4383 or hn / fe indices for nsar effects .",
    "for both of these indices , the primary metal sensitivity is due to an fe  i absorption line , hence the derived abundances from the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram are primarily [ fe / h ] .",
    "therefore , we will use this index pair to measure only [ fe / h ] , and not [ z / h ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundances derived from the nsar - corrected fe5270 versus h@xmath12 diagram reflect overall heavy element composition , thus are [ z / h ] .",
    "hereinafter , we will explicitly use the term _ [ z / h ] _",
    "( derived from the grid of fe5270 vs hn / fe or h@xmath12 ) to refer to the mean abundance of all the heavy elements , which have the solar abundance pattern .",
    "we will use _ [ fe / h ] _ to refer specifically the iron abundance ( derived from the grid of fe4383 vs hn / fe ) , which may not reflect [ z / h ] precisely , because of the presence of nsar .",
    "we will continue to use _ metallicity _ in a looser fashion , to refer either to [ fe / h ] or [ z / h ] , depending on the context .",
    "in table  [ tab : indcor ] we summarize the effects on the derived mean ages and metallicities for our galaxy sample of both emission and nsar corrections . for ages derived using the hn / fe index , the age shifts due to emission are fairly small , with the mean of the total sample changing from 8.9 to 8.2 gyr . for h@xmath12 derived ages , the mean shift in age due to emission correction is somewhat larger , from 11.1 to 9.3 gyr .",
    "the change in the metallicity determinations due to the emission correction is + 0.03 dex in the h@xmath12-fe5270 grids , and is negligible ( + 0.002 dex ) in the hn / fe versus fe4383 grids .",
    "as expected , the nsar corrections change the mean derived metallicity from the fe5270 versus h@xmath12 diagram , from [ fe / h]=-0.15 to [ z / h]=-0.03 , while the derived mean age is essentially unaffected by the nsar corrections . in addition , the mean galaxy age extracted from the emission - corrected , but not nsar - corrected , hn / fe versus fe4383 ( 8.3 gyr ) is quite consistent with that derived from the emission and nsar - corrected h@xmath12 versus fe5270 ( 9.3 gyr ) .",
    "hence we infer that the lack of nsar correction to hn / fe and fe4383 does not produce a large bias in derived ages .",
    "at this point , a case has been made that the luminosity - weighted mean ages of early - type galaxies are substantially younger for low-@xmath0 galaxies , particularly those with log @xmath0 @xmath41 2.0 . in addition , an intrinsic scatter in several key spectral indicators , including those measuring balmer line strength , appears to be present at _ all _ @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered and eliminated a variety of effects , other than mean age variations , that can explain the large variation in balmer line strength observed in the low @xmath0 galaxies . in this section",
    "we take up the issue as to whether consistent age and metal abundance determinations are obtained from a variety of different spectral indicators .",
    "we are especially concerned with whether the higher order balmer lines ( h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , and h8 ) give similar results to that obtained with the lick h@xmath12 index , whose characteristics as an age indicator have been well established .    in the preceding section we showed that early - type galaxies cover a large range in age when compared with model grids in the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram . to demonstrate that the basic results are not strictly dependent on the choice of metal feature , in fig .",
    "[ fig : hn5270_4plot ] we plot the lick fe5270 index versus hn / fe .",
    "as can be seen by comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] , the basic characteristic of the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram , i.e. , a trend to young ages among the lower @xmath0 galaxies , is reproduced in the f5270 versus hn / fe diagram .",
    "again , m32 is located among galaxies of the highest abundance .",
    "a more stringent test of the age - metallicity determinations is to repeat the analysis for different balmer lines , as well as for alternative measurements of a given balmer feature .",
    "a natural starting point is to compare the results obtained from the higher order balmer lines , as measured by the hn / fe index , with that obtained from the lick h@xmath12 index , which has been extensively modeled and utilized in the literature ( e.g. , trager 2000a , b ) , and hence represents a benchmark for all age determinations .",
    "the galaxy data is compared with model grids in the fe4383 versus h@xmath12 and fe5270 versus h@xmath12 diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : hb4383_4plot ] and [ fig : hb5270_4plot ] , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath12 data has been corrected both for emission and nsar effects , and fe5270 has been corrected for nsar .",
    "there are several aspects of the h@xmath12 plots which are noteworthy .",
    "first , the same qualitative features found in the higher order balmer lines , as represented by hn / fe , are clearly present in both h@xmath12 plots .",
    "most important , the general trend to young ages for lower @xmath0 galaxies is reproduced .",
    "second , the model grid lines in h@xmath12 plots , especially in the fe5270 versus h@xmath12 diagram , show a better orientation of isochrone and iso - metallicity lines along the index axes .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lick h@xmath12 index is an equivalent width measure of that feature , while hn / fe is a relative measure of a balmer line depth relative to an fe line depth .",
    "hence the h@xmath12 index more directly disentangles age from metallicity effects .",
    "a third feature of the h@xmath12 diagrams is that we find a greater number of galaxies lying outside the model grids lines at the oldest ages , which is strictly a zero point issue in the modeling . however , as a result it is easier to define a complete sample of ages and metallicities from the hn / fe diagrams , especially for 4383 versus hn / fe , in which only four galaxies lie in a region of the diagram for which no age / metallicity extrapolation is possible .    from the four combinations involving the two metal lines , fe4383 and fe5270 , and the two balmer line indices , hn / fe and h@xmath12 , we have produced four ages and metallicities for each galaxy .",
    "the results of these age and metallicity determinations are compiled in table  [ tab : gal_agez ] .",
    "the first column gives the galaxy i d , while columns ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) give the ages determined from fe4383 @xmath42 hn / fe , fe5270 @xmath42 hn / fe , fe4383 @xmath42 h@xmath12 , and fe5270 @xmath42 h@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "columns ( 6 ) - ( 10 ) give the metal abundances determined from those same four combinations of indices .",
    "errors in the ages and abundances are listed for the parameters derived from only the fe4383 @xmath42 hn / fe diagram , since those for the other index combinations will be similar .",
    "these errors were derived by finding the maximum age and metallicity differences implied by the index errors & model grids .    to illustrate the degree to which these individual age and metallicity estimates correlate with each other , in figs .  [",
    "fig : hbhn.age ] and [ fig : hbhn.met ] we show correlation plots for several combinations of age and metals determinations . the very tight correlation between ages derived from fe5270 versus h@xmath12 and those determined from fe4383 versus h@xmath12 again reflect the fact that age and metallicity are so nearly decoupled in these diagrams . thus inconsistencies between fe4383 and fe5270 do not translate into corresponding age uncertainties .",
    "a more interesting comparison can be seen in the correlation between the h@xmath12-fe5270 ages and the hn / fe - fe4383 ages , since these ages come from completely independent sets of spectral indicators , with rather different measurement techniques .",
    "the correlation between the derived ages is quite good , with an rms scatter around a straight line fit of 3.4 gyr .",
    "it is also clear that the age scale for fe5270 versus hn / fe determinations is systematically lower at large age than for the other determinations . in the metallicity correlation plots ,",
    "the best correlation is achieved , not surprisingly , when the same metal line is plotted versus the different balmer indices .",
    "note , however , that the correlation is still good between the [ fe / h ] values extracted from fe4383 versus hn / fe and the [ z / h ] values derived from fe5270 versus h@xmath12 . in short , we find good overall consistency between age and abundance determinations based on the two distinct measures of balmer line strength .",
    "the previous results have demonstrated that the ages and chemical compositions of galaxies are reasonably well reproduced from one balmer and metal feature to another .",
    "specifically , we have made a detailed comparison between ages and metallicities derived from the h@xmath12 and hn / fe balmer line indices and the fe4383 and fe5270 metal line indices .",
    "we have also carried out a comparison between different methods for measuring specific balmer lines .",
    "for instance , in the rose line ratio index system , h@xmath13 is characterized by the index ratio h@xmath13/fe@xmath44325 . on the other hand , @xcite defined an equivalent width measure of h@xmath13 , namely h@xmath13@xmath43 . to compare the results",
    "obtained from these and other balmer indices , we calculated the mean indices for the four different log @xmath0 groups for a variety of different indices .",
    "we then extracted mean ages and metallicities for these groups for various index combinations .",
    "the results for a variety of two - index diagrams are given in table  [ tab : gal_sigs3 ] .",
    "these results are summarized as follows :    0.5 cm ( 1 ) the overall trend of younger to older mean age with increasing log @xmath0 is reproduced regardless of which balmer and metal line combination is used .    0.5 cm ( 2 ) the mean ages and metallicities are particularly insensitive to the specific fe feature used , as can be seen by comparing the fe4383 results to the fe5270 results",
    ".    0.5 cm ( 3 ) there are significant differences in zero point ( and scale ) in the ages that are derived from different balmer lines , _ particularly in the case of h@xmath14_. we note that while schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) are able to obtain consistency between the spectroscopic age for 47 tuc , as derived from its integrated spectrum using both h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 , and the age based on its observed color - magnitude diagram , they are unable to obtain satisfactory agreement in the case of h@xmath14 .",
    "the problem appears to reside in the contamination of the red wing of h@xmath14 by the cn 4216 band .",
    "this effect can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] , where the spectra of several high @xmath0 galaxies with relatively old ages are plotted . note that the pseudo - continuum peak redward of h@xmath14 is substantially lower than its counterpart on the blueward side of the line . because the details of the cn feature are still not fully reproduced at the 1   level ,",
    "it is difficult to assess to what extent the h@xmath14 line core may be contaminated by cn in the case of @xmath10-element enhanced galaxy spectra . since the stellar spectra used in the ssp modeling come from solar neighborhood stars , the population models will not reproduce the enhanced cn features that are evident in , e.g. , 47 tuc and other galactic globular clusters , and in the integrated spectra of globular clusters in m31 ( burstein et al 1984 ; tripicco 1989 )",
    ".    0.5 cm ( 4 ) the derived ages from balmer lines are reasonably insensitive to the method of quantifying the line strengths .",
    "note that for both h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 the derived ages are quite consistent between the line ratio indices ( h@xmath44 and h@xmath45 ) and the pseudo - equivalent width indices ( h@xmath46 and h@xmath47 ) .      with the large number of galaxies in our sample and the existence of stellar population studies similar to ours @xcite , it is worthwhile to compare our derived ages and metallicities with those published by other groups .",
    "unfortunately , because our study has focused on the lower luminosity galaxies , our overlap with other groups is small .",
    "however , there are three studies for which we have galaxies in common . for the gonzalez sample of primarily field ellipticals analyzed by @xcite we have 9 galaxies in common",
    "; from the cluster and field sample of @xcite , we have 9 galaxies in common ; and from the study of the virgo cluster by @xcite we have 4 galaxies in common .",
    "the ages and metallicities determined in these studies are listed in table  [ tab : lit ] along with our values for comparison , and are shown graphically in figure  [ fig : litage ] .",
    "the agreement is good between our determinations and those published by @xcite and @xcite , and less so with the @xcite study .",
    "there are four galaxies which are in common between three of the four studies , ngc 2778 , ngc 4473 , ngc 4478 , and ngc 5831 . with the exception of single `` discordant '' values for ngc 2778 and ngc 5831",
    ", the agreement for these multiply determined ages is good .",
    "as expected , the agreement is better in relative ages and metallicities than in the zero points between one study and another .    on the matter of the enhancement ratios ( see appendix b ) , we can make a comparison only with the published trager et al . recall that we have avoided in this paper the massive galaxies , which would have the largest enhancement ratios , and hence the derived average ratios for the nine galaxies we have in common will not be large . for those galaxies , the mean [ e / fe ] ratio ( the ratio of all `` enhanced elements '' to iron ) found by trager et al . is 0.11 , while our value for [ mg / fe ] is 0.04 .",
    "while there is little doubt from the previous discussion that the low-@xmath0 galaxies exhibit a pronounced trend towards lower luminosity - weighted mean age , a more subtle question regards the possibility of an intrinsic age spread among the higher-@xmath0 galaxies as well . before considering the question from the perspective of age , i.e. , a modeled parameter",
    ", we first revisit the issue as to whether intrinsic scatter is present among the balmer line indices at high @xmath0 .",
    "the results of table  [ tab : inscat ] indicate , at face value , that there is a significant intrinsic scatter present in all indices at high @xmath0 . given ,",
    "however , that emission and nsar corrections do produce a significant change in the assessment of the scatter , it is worthwhile to consider the role played by these corrections .",
    "of greatest significance is the effect of emission on balmer line indices .",
    "returning to fig .",
    "[ fig : hbhn.newcor ] it is apparent that emission corrections are important for accurately assessing the high @xmath0 galaxies in h@xmath12 , while they are substantially less important for hn / fe .",
    "more specifically , we previously found that the mean change in age that results from applying emission corrections to h@xmath12 is 1.8 gyr ( and 0.7 gyr for hn / fe ) .",
    "this figure is actually an underestimate , since for many galaxies no age determination can be made before the correction is made , because the emission - contaminated indices lie outside the age - metallicity grid lines .",
    "note that the observational error used in extracting the intrinsic scatter in  5 only includes the actual uncertainties in the observations , and does not include the uncertainty introduced in making the emission correction . hence part of the intrinsic scatter found for the emission - corrected balmer indices could in principle be due to errors in correcting for emission .",
    "we now take a closer look at the issue of age scatter as determined from the hn / fe index .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] indicates that , even among the higher-@xmath0 galaxies , there is a sizable spread in that diagram , particularly in age .",
    "we discuss two ways to demonstrate that a true age spread is apparent even in the high @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "first , we show that the more extreme examples of younger and older galaxies are indeed reproducibly different in their spectra , i.e. , are not simply due to observational scatter from low s / n ratio .",
    "we then show that the distribution of high @xmath0 galaxies in the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram has a scatter in excess of that expected from the observational errors .    to show that there is a systematic change in the spectra from the youngest to oldest galaxies in the high @xmath0 sample , in fig .",
    "[ agespecs ] we plot the spectra of five high-@xmath0 galaxies , ranging in derived age from 2.8 gyr to 12.3 gyr , based on their location in fig .",
    "[ fig : hn4383_4plot ] .",
    "note that as one proceeds from the bottom ( oldest ) spectra , to the top ( youngest ) spectrum , a systematic change can be seen in the three higher order balmer lines , h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , and h8 , relative to their neighboring metal lines . specifically , in the bottom two spectra h@xmath13 is weaker than fe4325 , while in the top spectra it is stronger .",
    "likewise , h@xmath14 is slightly weaker than the neighboring blended feature at 4063   in the bottom spectra , while in the top spectrum it is distinctly stronger than that feature . finally ,",
    "while h8 is buried in the cn3883 band in the bottom spectrum , it clearly emerges at 3888   in the top spectra .",
    "the systematic trend in all three balmer lines , from younger to older galaxies , coupled with the reproducible nature of the metal lines from one galaxy to another , indicates the reality of the changing balmer line strengths along the age sequence .",
    "however , the changes in balmer line strength from 12.3 gyr to 2.8 gyr is indeed quite subtle , i.e. , high s / n ratio is required to discriminate such age changes from integrated spectra .    to further demonstrate the degree of intrinsic age and metallicity scatter among the higher @xmath0 galaxies , we have simulated the expected observational scatter in the fe4383 versus hn / fe diagram under different assumptions regarding the intrinsic age and metallicity scatter in the galaxies .",
    "the results of these simulations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim ] . in the upper left panel , ( a )",
    ", we have assumed a single mean age and metallicity for all of our simulated galaxies , hence only observational errors , and interpolated the hn / fe and fe4383 indices corresponding to that age and [ fe / h ] .",
    "we then randomly sampled 150 times from gaussian error distributions having rms scatters of @xmath250.014 and @xmath250.21 , which correspond to the median observational errors in hn / fe and fe4383 , respectively . in each case",
    "we added the observational errors to the mean indices corresponding to the selected mean age and metallicity of 9.5 gyr and [ fe / h]=-0.07 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](a ) we have plotted both the actual galaxy observations for the high-@xmath0 galaxies ( log @xmath0@xmath32.2 ) , as asterisks , and the simulated data , as unfilled circles .",
    "the large filled square represents the observed data for m32 . as usual , we plot the age and metallicity grid lines determined from the modeling .",
    "it is evident that the observed data has a significantly larger scatter than the simulations .",
    "hence we conclude that some intrinsic scatter in age and/or metallicity must be present in the high-@xmath0 galaxies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](b ) we have included an intrinsic scatter in age of @xmath252 gyr .",
    "to simulate such an age spread , we first randomly selected 150 times from an age distribution with an rms dispersion of @xmath252 gyr and a mean of 9.5 gyr . in all cases",
    "the metallicity was held fixed at [ fe / h]=-0.07 . for each realization",
    ", we interpolated the hn / fe and fe4383 indices for the given age and [ fe / h ] .",
    "we then randomly selected observational errors in hn / fe and fe4383 for each trial galaxy following the prescription above .",

    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](a ) . as a further test",

    "fig : hnfev4383_sim](c ) .",
    "the correspondence with the actual galaxy data is noticeably better in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](b ) , where an age scatter is introduced , rather than a metallicity scatter . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](d ) we have introduced a correlated age and metallicity scatter .",
    "we first randomly selected 150 ages with an rms scatter of 2 gyr around the mean age of 9.5 gyr .",
    "then for each age we calculated a metallicity according to the prescription :    [ fe / h ] = @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the age , in gyr , of the simulated galaxy .",
    "then we perturbed the metallicity by randomly sampling from a distribution with an rms of @xmath250.05 , and finally added in a randomly sampled observational error .",
    "the results of this simulation can be compared to the observed galaxy data in fig .",
    "[ fig : hnfev4383_sim](d ) .",
    "this correlated age - metallicity prescription appears to provide a closer representation to the observed galaxy data than either a scatter in age or metallicity alone .    in short , while the higher-@xmath0 galaxies clearly form a systematically older sample in age than their lower-@xmath0 counterparts , there are signs of an intrinsic spread in age even among these more massive galaxies .",
    "we return to this issue in more detail in papers ii and iii .",
    "while the previous sections have focused on establishing the reliability of the ages and metallicities derived in our study , here we emphasize our principal results for the e / s0 stellar populations and then briefly examine the implications for hierarchical models of galaxy evolution .",
    "we begin by showing the trend of mean age in our sample as a function of the measured velocity dispersion in fig .",
    "[ fig : age - mass ] .",
    "different symbols distinguish the field and virgo samples ( discussion of those samples will be taken up in the succeeding papers ) .",
    "in addition to the scatter seen at all velocity dispersions discussed above , a clear trend is seen , such that lower @xmath0 galaxies have younger ages .",
    "we have again used our velocity dispersions for consistency even though some values for low mass galaxies are higher than literature values .",
    "the overall sense of this figure does not change if we use the smaller dispersions .",
    "the ages in this figure come from the hn / fe - fe  4383 diagram ; if we use the h@xmath12-fe  5270 diagram , which is corrected for nsar , the same basic character of the data is found .",
    "there are then three principal conclusions to arise from the work presented in this paper .",
    "first , there is a large intrinsic spread in balmer line strength at low @xmath0 ( table  [ tab : inscat ] ) , and it appears that a small intrinsic spread is present at high @xmath0 as well .",
    "this spread in balmer line strength has been extensively modeled and shown to be due primarily to a spread in age .",
    "second , the mean age of galaxies increases with increasing velocity dispersion , leading to an age-@xmath0 trend , shown in figure  [ fig : age - mass ] .",
    "although no age-@xmath0 trend was observed in the samples of kuntschner ( 2000 ) or terlevich and forbes ( 2001 ) , our observed age-@xmath0 trend is in accordance with the results of trager ( 2002a , b ) , who suggest that large es are older , on average , than smaller es .",
    "it is not clear from figure  [ fig : age - mass ] whether there exists a continuous age-@xmath0   correlation , or whether there are two distinct populations  a sample of younger , low-@xmath0 galaxies ( log @xmath502.1 ) and a sample of older , high-@xmath0 galaxies . with the available information",
    ", we can not reliably distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "third , the trend in [ z / h ] with @xmath0 is modest , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : metsvssigma ] , where the [ z / h ] values derived from the nsar - corrected fe5270 and h@xmath12 indices are plotted versus log  @xmath0 .",
    "a fit to the relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : metsvssigma ] yields a slope of 0.32 , such that [ z / h ] increases by only @xmath60.2 over the observed range of 1.6@xmath1log  @xmath0@xmath12.4 .",
    "can our results place key constraints on age distributions predicted by numerical simulations of structure formation in the universe ?",
    "the most extensively modeled scenario is the cold dark matter picture , in which structure evolves through a hierarchical sequence of mergers ( e.g. , davis 1985 ) .",
    "two basic features of all hierarchical models provide testable predictions .",
    "first , it is expected that the merger process will lead to a significant scatter in the ages of assembly of the present epoch dark matter halos .",
    "second , the merger sequence naturally leads to an earlier assembly epoch ( and hence older age ) of the dark matter halos in lower mass galaxies , while the assembly of the higher mass galaxies occurs more recently , on average .",
    "consequently , the hierarchical models tend to predict that more massive early - type galaxies should have younger mean ages than low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results do indeed indicate a substantial scatter in the ages of early - type galaxies , consistent with a hierarchical scenario .",
    "on the other hand , we find the lower mass galaxies to be younger , which reverses the trend of the hierarchical predictions .",
    "we reserve a more extensive discussion of this apparent discrepancy to paper iii , but refer the reader to a discussion of this point in terlevich & forbes ( 2002 ) .",
    "the emphasis of this first paper has been to describe the techniques used to measure key spectral indicators and to model them through evolutionary population synthesis .",
    "we have demonstrated that spectral indicators which measure balmer lines from h@xmath12 through h8 , and measured using different techniques , give consistent results for the luminosity - weighted mean ages of early - type galaxies .",
    "our principal conclusion then is that a significant trend is present between galaxy mean age and mass in the sense that galaxies with velocity dispersions below 100 are younger on average than their higher @xmath0 counterparts .",

    "the detection of an emission spectrum superimposed on an absorption spectrum is a non - trivial task . in the case of the age - sensitive balmer lines ,",
    "the task is particularly problematic , since the extracted emission line strength will depend strongly on the assumed character of the underlying absorption spectrum . naturally , the properties of the absorption spectrum are themselves strongly dependent on the presumed age and metallicity of the galaxy , yet these are the quantities that we wish to determine .",
    "the problem is less severe for most of the forbidden metal lines , which tend to be superimposed on regions of the absorption spectrum that are less sensitive to assumptions about the stellar population . however , unless the temperature , chemical composition , and emission mechanism for the ionized gas can be independently determined , the ratio of emission in the forbidden metal lines to that in the balmer lines is not well constrained . to correct for the effects of emission on the absorption line strengths ,",
    "we have obtained spectra in the red , centered near h@xmath10 for 40% of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "a description of those observations is given in @xmath282.2.2 .",
    "the observed galaxies are indicated in column 9 of table  [ tab : log ] , where a `` y '' designation indicates that emission is detected in the galaxy and the [ nii]/h@xmath10 emission line intensity ratio is reliably measured , a `` n '' indicates that emission was not detected , and a `` u '' indicates that emission is probably detected , but no reliable value can be determined for the [ nii]/h@xmath10 ratio .      to evaluate the emission contamination of the balmer lines , we exploit two basic advantages of h@xmath10 for this purpose .",
    "first , while the equivalent widths of the balmer absorption lines are relatively constant along the balmer sequence , the emission decrement is steep .",
    "thus at h@xmath10 we maximize the contribution of emission relative to the underlying absorption .",
    "second , at h@xmath10 the sensitivity to the age and chemical composition of the underlying absorption spectrum is minimized ( compared with the higher order balmer lines ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that at h@xmath10 the light is preferentially dominated by the giant branch , thus relatively insensitive to age when compared to the higher order balmer lines ( where the main sequence turnoff light provides a higher contribution ) .",
    "the emission contamination was detected and removed in the following manner .",
    "of the 69 galaxies in our sample for which we have spectra at h@xmath10 , 29 of those have no detected emission in the [ oii]@xmath43727 line and are consequently considered to be emission free . from this sample of 29 emission free galaxies we have measured the relation between the hn / fe index ( which measures higher order balmer line absorption strength ) and the h@xmath10 absorption . a linear regression yields the relationship : @xmath51 with an rms scatter around the mean relation of @xmath250.14 , after eliminating two discrepant galaxies .",
    "since none of the galaxies are plagued by strong emission , we make the assumption that the emission is small enough in the h@xmath13 and higher order balmer lines so that the observed hn / fe indices for our galaxy spectra provide a good indicator of the true underlying absorption spectrum and a reliable predictor of the strength of h@xmath10 absorption . for a given emission - contaminated galaxy , we select from our sample of 29 emission - free galaxies a galaxy whose hn / fe index closely matches that of the contaminated galaxy and preferably has a lower velocity dispersion . from the velocity dispersion information determined from the blue spectra",
    ", we then smooth the red spectra of both the contaminated galaxy and the emission - free template to a common resolution , normalize the continuum of the template spectrum to that of the contaminated spectrum in the vicinity of h@xmath10 and then subtract off the template . from the difference spectrum the flux of @xmath52 _ emission _ is measured , using the iraf _ splot _ routine .",
    "then , assuming the emission follows the expected case b balmer decrement @xcite , the expected h@xmath12 emission flux is determined .    to translate the estimated h@xmath12 emission flux into corrected absorption line indices in the blue",
    ", a spectrum of the balmer emission must be subtracted from the contaminated blue spectrum .",
    "we have produced a spectrum of the balmer decrement covering h@xmath12 through h8 from a flux - calibrated observation of the orion nebula taken with the same instrumental set - up as the galaxy spectra .",
    "the individual relative hydrogen line strengths are adjusted to the case b recombination spectrum values .",
    "this spectrum , hereafter referred to as the balmer decrement spectrum , is then smoothed to the velocity dispersion of the emission - contaminated galaxy and normalized to have the same h@xmath12 emission flux as that expected from the h@xmath10 emission for the galaxy .",
    "the blue contaminated spectrum is then normalized to match the flux level of the red spectrum by utilizing the @xmath650of overlap between the blue and red spectra at @xmath45500 - 5550 .",
    "finally , the balmer decrement spectrum is subtracted from the normalized blue spectrum , which yields the `` corrected '' balmer absorption line strengths .",
    "the hn / fe index is re - measured and the process is repeated , usually only once , until the corrected hn / fe converges to a stable value .",
    "errors in this correction could result from a lack of spatial correspondence of the blue spectra and the h@xmath10 spectra , which is the case for some of the galaxies .",
    "if the emission distribution is not uniform ( which is usually the case ) , then spectra taken at different position angles will have different amounts of emission contribution to the absorption spectrum .",
    "however , in general the emission found in e / s0 galaxies is highly concentrated ( buson 1993 ) , and the extraction of our blue and red spectra was heavily weighted towards the central few arcseconds .",
    "thus we feel that any associated errors are minor .",
    "the method described above for correcting the emission contamination constitutes our preferred technique , since the corrections are based directly on the amount of h@xmath10 emission observed on an individual galaxy basis .",
    "however , we do not have red spectra , and hence the h@xmath10 emission information , for all of the galaxies in the sample . rather than leave the line indices uncorrected for the remaining 60% of the galaxies , we have opted to correct the indices by inferring the h@xmath10 emission flux from the emission present at the [ oii]@xmath43727 doublet .",
    "in this method , the assumption is that the excitation mechanism for emission in early - type galaxies shows little variation from one galaxy to another .    measuring the emission flux in",
    "the [ oii]@xmath43727 line first requires subtracting off the underlying continuum . to do this ,",
    "an emission - free template galaxy is chosen , vcc1279 , and all galaxies are normalized to match the continuum level near @xmath43727 for that galaxy .",
    "the template galaxy is then subtracted from each normalized galaxy spectrum , and the residual emission flux at [ oii ] is measured . for the galaxies _ with _ emission information at h@xmath10 , the red spectra are re - normalized to match the overlap with their blue counterparts , and the flux in the [ nii]@xmath46584 line is measured . a comparison between the two emission line fluxes yields a median log([nii / oii ] ) ratio of -0.45 ( figure  [ fig : histemis ] ) .",
    "thus , for each galaxy _ without _ information in the red , the [ oii ] emission flux can be measured , and , from the median of the flux ratio , an estimate of the flux at [ nii ] can be made . since the ultimate goal is to correct the balmer line indices , the flux in [ nii ] must now be related to the expected flux in the balmer lines . for the galaxies in our sample that have observed emission lines in their red spectrum ,",
    "we have measured the ratio of the flux at [ nii ] compared to the flux at h@xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : histemis ] ) and find a median log([nii]/h@xmath10 ) value for the sample of 0.1 .",
    "assuming that all galaxies have the same emission mechanism and the same ratio , ( which is not true , of course , but only an approximation ) , the expected flux in the h@xmath10 emission line can be estimated . finally , using the case b balmer decrement , the emission flux in h@xmath12",
    "is determined .    to translate the h@xmath12 emission flux estimated for each galaxy into spectral index corrections",
    ", we first evaluate the effects of a range of emission fluxes on two individual galaxies , vcc1279 , an old galaxy , and vcc1912 , a young galaxy .",
    "the balmer decrement spectrum is scaled to reflect the range of expected h@xmath12 emission fluxes ( 0.55.0 x 10@xmath53 ) for the galaxy sample and subtracted from the two template galaxies .",
    "the index values are measured for each of the balmer - subtracted galaxy spectra and the change in the index values as a function of the removed emission flux is determined from a linear fit .",
    "the coefficients of these fits are given in table  [ tab : e - lines ] .",
    "in summary , for each galaxy in the sample that has not already been corrected for emission contamination , the flux in the oii line is measured .",
    "the oii flux is related to the nii flux , and in turn , the h@xmath10 flux and the h@xmath12 emission flux . once the h@xmath12 flux is estimated , corrections to the line indices are made using the linear relations in table  [ tab : e - lines ] .",
    "for the two main age indicators used in this work  the lick h@xmath12 index and the rose hn / fe index  the mean index corrections are 0.15 and 0.012 , respectively . for a stellar population with an age of 8 gyr ,",
    "these corrections correspond to an age difference of 0.5 - 1 gyr , depending on the metallicity . to gauge the reliability of using the oii emission line flux to correct the spectral indices ,",
    "we have compared the corrected index values for both this method and the more robust method using the h@xmath10 emission flux from the red spectra (  3.3.2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hb_e ] shows that the results of the two methods agree quite well , with an rms scatter about the unity line of 0.25 .",
    "as mentioned in  4.5 , the analysis of the integrated light of galaxies is plagued by the fact that both the current models and the empirical stellar spectral libraries are based on stars having solar abundance ratio patterns .",
    "below we describe how corrections are made for nsar .",
    "these corrections are entirely based on the extensive work carried out by @xcite and by @xcite .      shown in figure",
    "[ fig : nsar ] are three index - index grids  fe 5270 vs.  h@xmath12 , mg  @xmath31 vs.  h@xmath12 , and fe 5270 vs.  mg  @xmath31  with our galaxy data over - plotted . of interest in these diagrams",
    "is the fact that the mean age and metallicity of the galaxy sample changes from diagram to diagram .",
    "specifically , the galaxies appear to be older and more metal - poor in the fe5270-h@xmath12 diagram than they do in the mg  @xmath31-h@xmath12 diagram .",
    "the different metallicity ( and age , to a lesser extent ) predictions can be most easily seen in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : nsar ] in which the bulk of the galaxies lie offset from the mg - fe population grids .",
    "this discrepancy between the metal abundances derived from the two different indices is further demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mgfemet ] , and is now widely accepted to be caused by non - solar abundance ratio effects .",
    "namely , the models predict too little mg at a given fe - absorption line strength , since the massive early - type galaxies have an enhancement of mg ( and other @xmath10 elements ) relative to the solar - abundance stars which comprise the population synthesis models .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that rather than considering mg and other @xmath10-elements to be enhanced in massive early - type galaxies , one should consider the fe - peak elements to be underabundant .      the overabundance of certain elements compared to fe ( or more appropriately , the underproduction of fe compared to the @xmath10 elements ) has a profound effect on the use of age / metallicity index diagrams if the model predictions reflect only solar abundance ratios . as noted above , the mg - derived metal abundances will be greater than those derived using an fe - index .",
    "in addition , since the age - metallicity degeneracy has not been completely broken ( the age and metallicity tracks are not perpendicular in the model grids ) , the age estimates derived using mg and fe line indices will differ as well .",
    "thus , trends in the intrinsic abundance ratios of the galaxies can lead to artificial trends in metallicity and/or age if the galaxies are not scaled to reflect the same elemental abundance ratios .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out an extensive investigation of the effects of nsar in early - type galaxies and tabulated corrections for a selection of important lick indices based on the work of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) and the worthey models .",
    "we use their preferred model 4 ( enhancement in both c and o ) corrections ( given in their table  5 ) and the method of kuntschner et al ( 2001 ) to correct a subset of our indices for the effects of nsar .",
    "the first step in the correction process is to estimate the galaxy age using the program described in  4.4 , using h@xmath12-fe5270 model index grids ( figure  [ fig : nsar ] ) .",
    "galaxies which lie outside the grids are assigned an age of 19 gyr . each galaxy",
    "is then shifted in the mg  @xmath31-fe5270 index grid , along the ratio vector defined from table  5 of @xcite , until it reaches the age predicted by the h@xmath12 index .",
    "the amount that the galaxy is shifted in the mg - fe index grid determines the scaling factor for that galaxy , which is then used to correct the other indices with @xmath14s listed in table  5 of @xcite , including h@xmath12 .",
    "the galaxy age is then redetermined using the corrected index values on the h@xmath12-fe5270 index grid , and shifted further in the mg - fe diagram until the corrected age estimate is reached .",
    "the remaining indices are then corrected for the new scaling factor and the entire process is reiterated one final time .",
    "the mean changes in all nsar - corrected indices , @xmath54index = index(_nsar _ ) - index(_0 _ ) , are -0.038 for h@xmath12 , -0.307 for mg  @xmath55 , and 0.178 for fe  5270 .",
    "a measure of the mg / fe enhancement ratio in the galaxies can be estimated by comparing the metallicity derived from a non - nsar - corrected h@xmath12-fe diagram to that measured in a non - corrected h@xmath12-mg  @xmath31 diagram ( e.g , figure  [ fig : nsar ] ) .",
    "determining the metallicity from these diagrams is complicated by the large number of galaxies that lie outside the model grids whose metallicities must be extrapolated .",
    "recent studies have found a mean enhancement ratio of mg / fe@xmath56 + 0.3 dex in luminous e s ( e.g. , trager 2000a , kuntschner 2001 ) , yet the mean value for our sample is found to be half of this value . because our sample is dominated by lower mass systems which tend to have solar or only mildly enhanced abundance ratios , the difference is not unexpected .",

    "<S> we have obtained blue integrated spectra of 175 nearby early - type galaxies , covering a wide range in galaxy velocity dispersion , and emphasizing those with @xmath0@xmath1100 . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies have been observed both in the virgo cluster and in lower - density environments . </S>",
    "<S> the main goals are the evaluation of higher order balmer lines as age indicators , and differences in stellar populations as a function of mass , environment and morphology . in this first paper </S>",
    "<S> our emphasis is on presenting the methods used to characterize the behavior of the balmer lines through evolutionary population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> lower-@xmath0 galaxies exhibit a substantially greater intrinsic scatter , in a variety of line strength indicators , than do higher-@xmath0 galaxies , with the large intrinsic scatter setting in below a @xmath0 of 100 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a greater contrast in scatter is present in the balmer lines than in the lines of metal features . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary synthesis modeling of the observed spectral indices indicates that the strong balmer lines found primarily among the low-@xmath0 galaxies are caused by young age , rather than by low metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> thus we find a trend between the population age and the central velocity dispersion , such that low @xmath0 galaxies have younger luminosity - weighted mean ages . </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated this analysis using several different balmer lines , and find consistent results from one spectral indicator to another . </S>"
