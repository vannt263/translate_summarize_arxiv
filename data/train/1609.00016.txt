    "much of the focus in the exoplanetary field still lies in the detection of planets using a variety of techniques , such as radial velocity ( rv ) signatures , transits , direct imaging , microlensing , among others . a significant factor that can affect",
    "the detection of exoplanets is the binarity of the host stars .",
    "in fact , it is believed that nearly half of all sun - like stars are part of a multiple - star system @xcite .",
    "this high - rate of multiplicity has also been found in exoplanet host stars through follow - up of _ kepler _ candidates @xcite and robo - ao observations of rv exoplanet host stars @xcite .",
    "the mere presence of a binary companion can substantially affect astrometric and rv measurements of the host star , and cause severe blended contamination for transit experiments @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative to verify the multiplicity of exoplanet host stars to ensure correct interpretation of exoplanet signals .",
    "moreover , the binarity of the stars can place further constraints on planetary formation .",
    "@xcite explored the orbital stability of the planets in the presence of a binary star system .",
    "additionally , correlations between planets mass and their period @xcite and eccentricities @xcite were examined .",
    "several binary systems have been studied , such as @xmath9 centauri @xcite , sirius @xcite , @xmath10 coronae borealis @xcite , and 30 arietis b @xcite , which provide us rich information on orbital dynamics in a n - body system .",
    "this paper presents new results on stellar companions to the exoplanet host stars hd  2638 and hd  164509 . the stellar companion",

    "it is believed to be part of a wide binary system with the nearby star hd  2567 .",
    "@xcite performed a bayesian analysis of both stars astrometry ; the result yielded 99% chance of both stars being true companions .",
    "however , @xcite argued that , barring any errors in the measurement of the stars parallax , they are separated by 6.8 pc , making them not gravitationally bound .",

    "@xcite discovered that hd  2638 has a stellar companion while examining the system with robo - ao .",
    "@xcite analyzed the orbital dynamics of the primary star and the stellar companion and determined that the masses of the components are 0.87 @xmath12 and 0.46 @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "moreover , they inferred that the spectral types are g8v and m1v and that they are separated by about 28.5 au , giving them an orbital period of around 130 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed additional astrometric and photometric analysis on the system and found that the mass of the companion star is @xmath27 @xmath12 .",
    "hd  164509 is a g5v star that is about 52  pc away toward the constellation of ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "it is known to host one planet , hd 164509b , with a mass of approximately 0.48 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , upon examining the rv data , found that it displays `` a residual linear trend of @xmath28 m s@xmath29 year@xmath29 , indicating the presence of an additional longer period companion in the system '' .",
    "@xcite studied this system and reported a 150 mhz radio signature of @xmath30 mjy .",
    "the authors speculated that it could be the cause of a massive moon `` orbiting a rapidly - rotating giant planet '' ; however , they emphasized that more analysis is needed before such a conclusion can be reached .",
    "speckle observations of our target stars were obtained with the differential speckle survey instrument , or dssi @xcite .",
    "this instrument was built at southern connecticut state university by one of us ( e. h. ) , and currently enjoys official visitor instrument status at the gemini - north observatory .",
    "the observations were carried out as part of a larger survey program that aims to detect low - mass stellar companions to exoplanet host stars .",
    "observations were carried out in july , 2014 when @xmath3160 targets were observed .",
    "each measurement was acquired using two different passbands , one at 692  nm and another at 880  nm .",
    "the 692  nm filter has fwhm of 40  nm , and the 880  nm filter has fwhm of 50  nm . after all images underwent data reduction , they were directly examined using the ds9 program for any bright source appearing next to the target .",
    "the two particular targets described here , hd  164509 and hd  2638 , were observed during the night of 2014 july 22 and 23 respectively .",
    "the results from the remainder for the survey targets will be published elsewhere .",
    "final reconstructed images were produced from the speckle data sequences using methods that have been described in previous papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we will briefly describe the main points here .",
    "the raw speckle data are stored as fits data cubes consisting of 1000 frames , where each frame is a @xmath32-pixel image centered on the target .",
    "frames are bias - subtracted , and then an autocorrelation is formed .",
    "these are then summed to generate a final autocorrelation for the entire observation .",
    "we fourier transform this to obtain the spatial frequency power spectrum of the observation .",
    "the same operations are then performed on an unresolved star ( effectively a point source ) that lies close on the sky to the science target . by dividing the power spectrum of the science target by that of the point source , we deconvolve the effects of the speckle statistics , and arrive at a diffraction - limited estimate of the true power spectrum of the object .",
    "returning to the raw data frames , we next form the image bispectrum of each frame , which is the fourier transform of the triple correlation , as described in @xcite .",
    "this data product is known to contain information that can be used to calculate the phase of the object s fourier transform , which we do using the relaxation algorithm of @xcite . by taking the square root of the deconvolved power spectrum and combining it with this phase estimate ,",
    "we generate a diffraction - limited estimate of the ( complex ) fourier transform of the object .",
    "finally we multiply this with a gaussian low - pass filter of width similar to the diffraction limit of the telescope , and inverse - transform to arrive at the final reconstructed image .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the presence of stellar companions can pose a significant challenge for orbital stability and formation scenarios for planets in such systems @xcite .",
    "issues regarding planet formation include protoplanetary disc truncation , grain condensation , and planetesimal accumulation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to test that our observations are consistent with the presence of the planets , we use the orbital dynamics results of @xcite for test particles in binary systems .",
    "specifically , we calculate the critical semi - major axis , @xmath33 , beyond which planetary orbits would be unstable in the systems .",
    "the resulting plots of @xmath33 as a function of binary eccentricity @xmath34 are shown in figure  [ ecclimits ] .",
    "the values of @xmath33 were calculated using equation 1 from @xcite : @xmath35 a_b    \\end{split }    \\label{eqnac}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the binary semi - major axis .",
    "the mass ratio , @xmath37 , is calculated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the masses of the primary and secondary respectively .",
    "using the values from tables [ data ] and [ isotable ] , we have @xmath41 & @xmath42  au for hd  2638 , and @xmath43 & @xmath44  au for hd  164509 .",
    "note that this assumes the projected separations are the true semi - major axes of the binary companions . including both the uncertainties in equation  [ eqnac ] and @xmath37",
    ", we include lines for the 1@xmath45 uncertainties as dashed lines in figure  [ ecclimits ] .",
    "the semi - major axes of the known planets ( see table  [ prop ] ) are represented in each case by a horizontal dotted line .",
    "these figures show the stability of the planetary orbits remain secure for most values of the binary eccentricity . the maximum binary eccentricities ( where the planetary semi - major axis lines intersect the eccentricity lines ) are @xmath46 and @xmath47 for hd  2638 and hd  164509 respectively .",
    "given that the planets were discovered with the rv technique , it is worth pausing to consider the effect of the stellar binary companions on the planetary interpretation of the rv data .",
    "using the stellar parameters of the primary and secondary from tables [ prop ] and [ isotable ] respectively , along with the projected separations from table [ data ] , we calculate the expected orbital periods and rv semi - amplitudes for each system . for hd  2638 ,",
    "the minimum orbital period is @xmath31110 years with a maximum rv semi - amplitude of @xmath312.4  km / s . for hd  164509 ,",
    "the minimum orbital period is @xmath31180 years with a maximum rv semi - amplitude of @xmath311.7  km / s . as noted in section  [ properties ] , the kepler solution to the hd  164509 rvs includes a linear trend , though the time baseline since discovery is insufficient to charactize the nature of the trend . assuming the minimum separations above",
    ", the companions can not be confused with the planetary signals and thus have no effect on the planetary interpretation of the rv data .",
    "determining the stellar architecture of planetary systems is an on - going process , improving as the capability to detect faint stellar companions increases .",
    "stellar binarity can have a profound effect on exoplanetary systems , both in terms of formation processes and long - term orbital stability . thus determining the binarity of known exoplanet host stars is a critical step in the characterization of those systems .",
    "here we have presented detections of stellar companions to two known exoplanet host stars : hd  2638 and hd  164509 . though the stellar companion to hd  2638",
    "was previously detected by @xcite , the new data from dssi will provide additional information of the astrometry of the companion and the stellar properties , given that the passbands used are particular to the dssi camera .",
    "we have shown that the detected companions have properties consistent with them both being m dwarfs , and the isochrone analysis shows that they are both likely to be gravitationally bound to the host stars .",
    "fortunately , the presence of the stellar companions do not pose serious orbital stability problems for the known exoplanets , making the overall architecture of the systems self - consistent .",
    "these planetary systems represent additional interesting examples of planet formation and evolution in the presence of multiple stars .",
