    "a jordan domain @xmath0 is the the homeomorphic image of a closed disk in @xmath1 .",
    "the image of the boundary circle is a jordan curve , which by the jordan curve theorem separates the plane into two open domains , one bounded , the other not , such that the curve is the boundary of each .",
    "a _ local geodesic _ is a curve @xmath2 such that for every non - end point @xmath3 of @xmath2 there is an open subarc @xmath4 of @xmath2 containing @xmath3 such that the arc of @xmath4 between any two points of @xmath4 is a shortest curve in @xmath0 connecting those two points .",
    "bourgin and renz @xcite have analyzed the local geodesics in such domains , concluding the following :    * a jordan domain is uniquely geodesic .",
    "* at every non - end point of a geodesic , the geodesic is supported by a closed half - disk with center at the point and interior contained in the interior of the jordan domain .",
    "* geodesics are characterized in terms of separation : a point @xmath3 is not on the geodesic from @xmath5 to @xmath6 if and only if there is a straight line segment @xmath7 with ends on the boundary @xmath8 of @xmath0 , but otherwise in the interior of @xmath0 , such that @xmath3 is in one connected component of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are in the other .",
    "although geodesics may be infinitely long when an end is on the boundary , the unique determination of a geodesic by its ends is still true .",
    "we assume throughout that geodesics are parametrized by an arclength parameter , and for a geodesic ray the parameter is @xmath11 at the origin of the ray and positive elsewhere .",
    "there has been a little previous related work concerning not quite the same domains : in the thesis of f .- e .",
    "wolter @xcite it is proved that a simply connected plane domain with locally rectifiable boundary has the unique geodesic property ; in a recent text @xcite there is an outline of a proof that locally simply - connected plane domains are locally cat(0 ) . in the latter ,",
    "although the outline is entirely plausible and at a level of rigor appropriate to a text at that level , essential technical details ( the unique geodesic property and a consideration of triangles with `` tails '' ) are not mentioned .",
    "it is probable that the cat(0 ) property , but certainly not gromov hyperboliciy , can be extended to unbounded domains by exhausting them with their intersection with increasing disks ; also extensions giving natural curvature bounds for similar domains in riemannian surfaces are likely to be true ; but it seems as though these extensions would not present any interesting challenges .",
    "the set @xmath12 of _ finite - distance _ points of @xmath0 consists of interior points and those points of @xmath8 which can be connected to any ( and hence every ) interior point by a curve of finite length .",
    "note that every pair of points in the interior can be connected by polygonal curve in the interior , and so have finite distance apart .",
    "if a straight line segment is interior to @xmath0 except for one end , then that end is also in @xmath12 ; in particular , only the ends of a geodesic can fail to be in @xmath12 , since non - ends are either already interior to @xmath0 or a radius of a supporting half - disk provides a segment to an interior point .",
    "the remaining subset of @xmath8 , points not in @xmath12 , is called the _ ( metric ) boundary _ of @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 .    a _ geodesic triangle _ in a metric space consists of three shortest curves ( its _ sides _ ) connecting a triple of points ( its _ vertices _ ) .",
    "a _ comparison triangle _ in @xmath1 is a triangle with the same side - lengths , and by taking equal distances from the vertices we get comparison points on the sides .",
    "a geodesic triangle is _ thin _ if the distance between every pair of points in the sides is @xmath14 the distance between the comparison points .",
    "a cat(0 ) _ space _ is a complete metric space such that every pair of points can be joined by a ( finite - length ) geodesic and every geodesic triangle is thin .",
    "it is easy to show that a cat(0 ) space is uniquely geodesic and contractible @xcite .",
    "conversely , if a space is locally cat(0 ) and simply connected , then it is cat(0 ) @xcite .",
    "[ thm : main ] the set @xmath12 of finite - distance points of a jordan domain @xmath0 is a cat(0 ) space .",
    "consider three points @xmath15 .",
    "we suppose that the geodesic triangle with vertices @xmath16 is nondegenerate , since degenerate triangles are trivially thin .",
    "then the two sides starting from @xmath3 must consist of a common part ( which may be just @xmath3 ) ending at a bifurcation point @xmath17 ; similarly , there are bifurcation points @xmath18 on the sides starting from @xmath10 . then @xmath19 is a jordan curve in @xmath12 and @xmath20 consists of @xmath19 with three `` tails '' . clearly if we show that @xmath19 is thin , then @xmath20 is also thin .",
    "the interior of @xmath19 must lie in the interior of @xmath12 , and at each point of a side which also lies in the interior of @xmath12 , that side is locally a straight line segment .",
    "hence at those points the side is supported by half - disks in the interior of @xmath12 , both interior and exterior to @xmath21 .",
    "but at a point of a side which is in @xmath13 , a supporting half - disk can only lie entirely in the domain bounded by @xmath19 .",
    "thus , a side of @xmath22 is supported at every point except the ends by an open half - disk interior to @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the sides are locally convex and have well - defined one - sided directions at every point and also a total curvature . at the ends",
    "the signed turning angle ( choose an orientation of @xmath1 ! ) is at most @xmath23 , while the signed total curvature of any simple closed , locally convex curve must be @xmath24 .",
    "the signed total curvatures of the sides must be @xmath25 , so together they add to at least @xmath26 . in particular",
    ", each side must actually be convex , i.e. , is on the boundary of its convex hull , and the remaining part of that boundary is a straight line segment .",
    "the triangle of these three segments has @xmath19 in its interior , so that @xmath19 must have angle sum @xmath27 .",
    "one of alexandrov s criteria for a locally cat(0 ) space is that locally angle sums of triangles are @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath12 is simply connected , we conclude that it is also cat(0 ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath12 is complete .",
    "indeed , distances in @xmath12 are @xmath28 the corresponding euclidean distances , so that a cauchy sequence in @xmath12 is also cauchy in the plane .",
    "the limit in the plane is in @xmath0 and the distance of the limit from any point of the sequence is finite .",
    "let us call a triangle in @xmath12 such as @xmath19 a _",
    "jordan triangle_. as a corollary to the above proof we have a uniform bound on the perimeter of jordan triangles :    [ cor : trianglebound ] if @xmath29 is the diameter of @xmath0 in @xmath1 , then the perimeter of every jordan triangle is bounded by @xmath30 .    in @xmath1 the length of a closed convex curve",
    "is monotone increasing with respect to the inclusion ordering of convex hulls .",
    "we can choose euclidean segments from the vertices of @xmath19 so that they do nt intersect the sides and either are concurrent or meet in pairs to give a triangle @xmath31 in the interior .",
    "the latter case is generic , pictured in figure [ fig : jtriangle ] .",
    "the sides of the jordan triangle are shorter than the smaller triangle in which they are contained ; that is , @xmath32 , etc . in the concurrent case ,",
    "when point @xmath33 , then the segments @xmath34 are in the interior of @xmath19 except for the ends .",
    "the sum of the lengths of these segments from @xmath35 is at most @xmath36 ( the sum of distances in @xmath1 from several points is a convex function , so the maximum on a triangle must occur at a vertex ) , and hence twice that sum is greater than twice the sum of the two longest side - lengths of @xmath19 .    the generic case can be reduced to the concurrent case by showing that there is an interior point @xmath35 of @xmath31 such that the segments @xmath34 again have pairwise sums of lengths which bound the lengths of @xmath37 . consider the ellipse with foci @xmath38 passing through @xmath39 .",
    "for any point on that ellipse the sum of distances from @xmath38 is the same , hence greater than @xmath40 . for a point outside the ellipse",
    "the sum is even greater , so that is true for any point ( except @xmath39 ) on the tangent line to the ellipse at @xmath39 .",
    "but the rule for reflection in an ellipse tells us that that tangent line bisects @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the angle bisectors of @xmath42 give points from which the sums of distances from @xmath43 and @xmath18 majorize the lengths of @xmath44 .",
    "thus we can take @xmath35 to be the incenter of @xmath31 .",
    "a geodesic metric space @xmath12 is _",
    "@xmath45-hyperbolic _ , where @xmath46 , if for every triangle the distance from any point on one side of the triangle to the union of the other two sides is @xmath47 . if @xmath12 is @xmath45-hyperbolic for some @xmath45 , then it is _",
    "gromov hyperbolic_.    when @xmath12 is a jordan domain , it is clear that it is @xmath45-hyperbolic if the defining property is true for every jordan triangle in @xmath12 .",
    "half the perimeter of the triangle obviously satisfies the defining property , so by corollary [ cor : trianglebound ] @xmath12 is @xmath36-hyperbolic .",
    "however , a better value for @xmath45 is obtained by observing that for a euclidean triangle the extreme case is equilateral and if the side - lengths are @xmath29 , then the maximum distance from a point to the other sides is half the altitude . thus we obtain the sharp value for @xmath45 , realized by the case when @xmath12 is bounded by an equilateral triangle of side @xmath29 .    if @xmath12 is a jordan domain with euclidean diameter @xmath29 , then it is @xmath48-hyperbolic .",
    "for a cat(0 ) space @xmath12 the boundary at infinity @xmath13 consists of asymptote classes of geodesic rays ; two rays are _ asymptotic _ if the distance between pairs at equal distance from their origins is bounded .",
    "the _ cone topology _ on @xmath49 is defined by specifying a neighborhood basis : for points of @xmath12 we take the usual metric neighborhoods . the neighborhoods of @xmath13 are defined in terms of a fixed center point @xmath50 , and then it is proved that the resulting topology is independent of @xmath3 . for an infinite ray @xmath2 starting at @xmath3 and positive numbers",
    "@xmath51 we define a neighborhood @xmath52 of the asymptote class of @xmath2 to be the points on geodesics starting at @xmath3 which pass through the ball @xmath53 and have distance @xmath54 from @xmath3 , along with the asymptote classes of the extensions of those geodesics to rays whenever possible .",
    "( the definition was originally due to eberlein and oneill for riemannian manifolds @xcite . ) for each asymptote class there is exactly one ray for a given origin @xcite .",
    "[ lem : rays]for a jordan domain @xmath0 and the space of finite points @xmath12 , two asymptotic rays in @xmath12 must eventually coincide .",
    "we first prove this for two asymptotic rays @xmath55 for which the origins are interior points @xmath56 of @xmath0 such that the geodesic connecting them is a straight line segment in the interior .",
    "then any triangle @xmath20 must end in a tail at @xmath6 as soon as @xmath57 , since bifurcation of geodesics can only occur at boundary points , not at @xmath56 ( unless @xmath20 is degenerate and the following conclusion is trivial ) .",
    "taking @xmath58 , as soon as @xmath59 the continuation of the segment from @xmath5 to @xmath60 by @xmath61 is a geodesic ray asymptotic to @xmath2 .",
    "since the origin is @xmath5 , that ray must coincide with @xmath7 .",
    "so for close - by interior points `` eventually '' means as soon as the sum of distances from their origins exceeds @xmath30 .",
    "now for arbitrary origins in @xmath12 we can connect them by a curve @xmath62 through the interior , and for any two interior points of @xmath62 , we conclude that beyond the distance @xmath36 from @xmath62 , the rays in the given asymptote class coincide .",
    "the limit rays at the ends then must also coincide beyond that distance .",
    "[ thm : topology ] for a jordan domain @xmath0 the asymptote classes of the space of finite points @xmath12 can be indentified with the points of @xmath8 at infinite distance .",
    "the topology on @xmath0 coincides under this identification with the cone topology on @xmath63 .",
    "a ray in @xmath12 has a unique limit point in @xmath8 , which by lemma [ lem : rays ] is the same for all rays in the same asymptote class .",
    "suppose that @xmath64 is the end of a ray @xmath2 from @xmath50 , so @xmath5 is identified with the asymptote class of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath53 specify a cone neighborhood @xmath52 of @xmath5 .",
    "then there is a straight line segment @xmath65 contained in @xmath53 , and containing @xmath66 , transverse to @xmath2 . if @xmath67 , then , say , take @xmath68 and @xmath65 to be a radius of a supporting half - disk at @xmath66",
    ". otherwise @xmath65 can be in the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the first points in geodesic extensions of the geodesics @xmath70 where those extensions intersect @xmath8 ( so that if @xmath71 let @xmath72 ) .",
    "since @xmath69 must be at finite distance from @xmath3 , they are different from @xmath5 . see figure [ fig : cone ] .    then there is a jordan curve obtained by chaining together geodesics @xmath73 , @xmath65 , @xmath74 with the arc of @xmath8 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 which does not contain @xmath5 .",
    "a sufficiently small disk centered at @xmath5 will not intersect that new jordan curve , and any geodesic from @xmath3 to a point of that disk must cross @xmath65 , so the point in the disk must be in @xmath52 .",
    "thus there are neighborhoods of the induced topology on @xmath0 in a cone topology neighborhood .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath77 is the intersection of @xmath0 with a disk @xmath78 centered at @xmath5 , so that @xmath77 is a neighborhood of the induced topology .",

    "see figure [ fig : disk ] .",
    "the arcs of @xmath8 in @xmath77 from @xmath76 to @xmath5 and from @xmath75 to @xmath5 each must contain only one of @xmath81 , since both of those arcs connect @xmath5 to @xmath82 and cross @xmath65 .",
    "the geodesic @xmath80 together with the arc of @xmath8 with ends @xmath69 not containing @xmath5 is a jordan curve having @xmath3 inside and @xmath83 outside ; then the jordan curve consisting of @xmath65 and the arc of @xmath8 from @xmath6 to @xmath84 through @xmath5 must bound a domain @xmath85 inside @xmath77 .",

    "then for sufficiently small @xmath87 the ball @xmath88 will be separated by @xmath65 and contained in @xmath77 ; we can take @xmath89 the distance in @xmath1 from @xmath66 to @xmath90 . then any point of @xmath52",
    "will either be in @xmath88 or @xmath85 , and hence in @xmath77 .",
    "the continuity of geodesics in @xmath0 as a function of their endpoints has also been addressed by fabel ( @xcite ) .",
    "he proves that when the endpoints of a sequence converge in @xmath0 , then the geodesics converge uniformly with respect to the euclidean metric .",
    "there is also a convergence interpretation of theorem [ thm : topology ] .",
    "namely , it says that the convergence of endpoints is equivalent to convergence of the geodesics uniformly on bounded sets in the length metric . a related fact for cat(0 )",
    "spaces , which provides a link between the two kinds of convergence in jordan domains , is that the distance @xmath91 between two geodesics is a convex function of @xmath92 for any @xmath93 . on a bounded interval of @xmath94",
    "the convergence of the end values of a convex function implies the uniform convergence on the interval .",
    "thus euclidean convergence of the infinite endpoints controls the unbounded ends of geodesics uniformly with respect to the euclidean metric , and the convexity of the length metric ( which majorizes the euclidean metric ) controls the bounded part .",
    "this provides the kernel of the proof that the two kinds of convergence are equivalent .",
    "however , fabel goes on to prove a much stronger theorem , namely , the euclidean - uniform continuity of geodesics not only as functions of the ends , but also as functions of the domain @xmath0 with respect to the hausdorff distance .",
    "this paper was an outgrowth of another project by s. alexander , r. ghrist , and the author concerning the use of cat(0 ) spaces in pursue - evade theory .",
    "in particular , the author thanks ghrist for passing on the reference @xcite to him ."
