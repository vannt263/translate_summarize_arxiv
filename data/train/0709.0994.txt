    "some techniques exploit the tendencies of deposited atoms to aggregate into cluster - based nanostructures , such as the wire - like chains of clusters that can form on the naturally occurring step - edges on graphite @xcite .",
    "however many techniques involve the deposition onto a substrate of clusters that are first prepared in the gas phase .",
    "for this reason the collision of clusters with surfaces has been studied by many groups @xcite .",

    "however , since the position of these surface defects or aggregates is usually random , the placement of the structures can not be controlled .",
    "in contrast , by using lithographically defined v - grooves on passivated si surfaces as templates @xcite , a transition from adhesion to reflection can be exploited to form clean wire - like structures in the v - groove , if the deposition velocity is such that clusters bounce when they land away from the template , and stick ( or slide ) only in the v - groove .    although the possibility of cluster reflection from hard surfaces was been postulated some time ago ( see the  phase \" diagrams in refs .",

    "one enters either the fragmentation regime where the cluster fragments @xcite or undergoes significant evaporation upon impact @xcite , or the implantation regime where the cluster buries itself in the surface @xcite . in the soft - landing regime ,",
    "the incident kinetic energy is generally insufficient to overcome the adhesion between the surface and the cluster , resulting in collisions that always lead to adhesion .",
    "only recently has an intermediate regime been identified where antimony and bismuth clusters were observed to undergo a transition from adhesion to reflection ( while remaining substantially intact ) as the kinetic energy was increased @xcite .",
    "this transition has been now been exploited to assemble nanowires on a variety of patterned substrates @xcite .",
    "while the study of collisions of solid bodies stretches back at least as far as newton s treatment in the principia , it is not clear to what extent the macropscopic theory of collisions applies to the collision of nanoscale bodies .",
    "an important quantity in macroscale collisions is newton s coefficient of restitution , @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the reflected to incident velocity , and which effectively measures the degree of inelasticity of a collision .",

    "although inelastic collisions have been studied extensively for collisions of micro- or milliscale particles @xcite , much less is known about the collision of nanoscale objects such as atomic clusters where adhesive forces will be much more important , and mechanisms for deformation will depend on size . at the macroscale",

    "it is of interest to ask whether this theory applies at the nanoscale , and whether it can be used describe cluster deposition .",
    "here we report on a detailed molecular dynamics study of the reflection of clusters with kinetic energies that lie between the soft - landing and fragmentation regimes , on surfaces with a weak attraction to the cluster .",
    "the resulting collisions span a range from weakly to strongly inelastic , resulting in little to substantial deformation of the cluster .",

    "the mackay icosahedra are made up of 20 tetrahedrally shaped fcc units which share a common vertex .",
    "the ( 111)-terminated 7680-atom surface slab consists of a fixed bottom layer and 15 layers of dynamic atoms with dimensions of @xmath10 .",

    "if we were to use the lennard - jones parameters for argon ( @xmath15  , @xmath16 j ) @xcite , our unit time corresponds to @xmath17 ps .",

    "the melting point of the clusters was determined by constructing caloric curves @xcite with the melting temperature of the 147-atom cluster found to be @xmath21 .",

    "in this section we present the results from a large number of simulated collisions for a range of parameters including the initial cluster velocity @xmath22 ( in reduced units ) , the angle of incidence , the cluster - surface interaction @xmath8 , and the cluster size .",
    "we begin by looking at the effect of @xmath8 on the wetting of the surface by the cluster .",
    "we then discuss several collisions in detail at fixed cluster orientation and cluster - surface adhesion strength .",
    "we then examine a large number of collisions averaged over cluster orientation for @xmath23 where we focus on the the reentrant adhesion transition .",
    "next we examine the effect of varying @xmath8 between 0.2 and 0.7 . for values of @xmath24",
    ", we find a transition between adhesion and reflection that takes place at low velocities ( @xmath25 ) . for values of @xmath8 between 0.3 and 0.4",
    "we observe a reentrant transition from reflection to adhesion at intermediate velocities ( @xmath26 ) followed once more by a transition to reflection .",
    "this reentrant transition occurs at the onset of a large deformation regime which increases the cluster contact area with the surface and thereby increases the adhesion energy .",
    "finally , we look at collisions at non - normal incidence . we find that collisions at non - normal incidence follow a very similar behavior if one analyzes the results in terms of the normal velocity component .",
    "figure  [ contact ] shows a selection of snapshots of solid 147-atom clusters after equilibration on the ( 111 ) surface for @xmath27 time steps for various values of @xmath8 . clearly , at @xmath28 the cluster can be regarded as `` wetting '' the surface . to estimate the contact angle we fitted a spherical cap to the positions of the cluster s surface atoms and at @xmath29 , the contact angle @xmath30 was found to be 88@xmath31 .",
    "we note that for @xmath24 , the solid clusters effectively do nt wet the surface at all over the relaxation times examined here .",
    "interestingly , although they remain bound , we observe significant diffusion of the cluster on the surface for @xmath24 for both the liquid and solid clusters .    in their experiments ,",
    "partridge et al @xcite estimated contact angles of @xmath32 for sb and @xmath33 for bi on sio@xmath34 using sem imaging .",
    "however , as is possible that some of the clusters were molten prior to deposition , or even melted during the collision but later solidified as they cooled on the substrate , only tentative estimates of the the adhesion energies for sb and bi on sio@xmath34 can be made based on these contact angles .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that the impact of the clusters lead to spreading of the cluster on the surface .",
    "of course , the purpose of this study is not to precisely simulate the system in ref  @xcite , but rather to gain a general understanding of the reflection - adhesion transition . in section",
    "[ discuss ] , we will consider the relationship between the simulated and experimental collisions in more detail .",
    "here we examine three collisions of the solid 147-atom icosahedral cluster , oriented edge - on to the surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ impactsnap ] , at low , medium and high velocities with the cluster - surface interaction strength fixed at @xmath23 .",
    "this will allow us to introduce the quantities we will later use to analyze a larger number of collisions as parameters are varied .",
    "[ vz ] plots the evolution of the velocities of the cluster center of mass of center for clusters with initial velocities @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the clusters with intial velocities of @xmath37 and @xmath36 escape , while the cluster that had initial velocity @xmath38 , is bound and its velocity oscillates about zero .",
    "we will see in subsequent sections that this propensity for clusters to stick at intermediate velocities is typical for @xmath23 .",
    "note the slight acceleration and deceleration of the cluster in each case just before and just after the collision due to the attraction between the cluster and the surface .",
    "for this reason we define the coefficient of restitution for the collision , @xmath0 , as the ratio of the peak velocity after collision to that before the collision as shown in the figure i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this is a convenient choice for the definition for @xmath0 in the presence of a significant adhesive interaction between the cluster and the surface .",
    "a more conventional choice would define @xmath0 to be the ratio of the initial and final velocities but this leads to @xmath40 for clusters that adhere to the surface . in our simulations , where clusters frequently adhere to the surface , our definition of @xmath0 it provides a measure of the reflected kinetic energy ` available ' for escape . in what follows",
    "we refer to quantities evaluated at the moment of peak velocity after collision ( the ` pull - off ' ) with a subscript @xmath41 .    to examine the deformation of the cluster during the collision ( illustrated in fig  [ impactsnap ] by snapshots of the collisions taken at @xmath42 , which is close to the moment of maximum deformation ) we use the radius of gyration , @xmath43 , where for example , @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 figure  [ rz ] shows the evolution of @xmath44 for the three collisions .",
    "in all three cases @xmath44 increases sharply at the collision . at @xmath46",
    "the deformation is small and reversible suggesting that the deformation is largely elastic .",
    "both of the higher velocity collisions show evidence of irreversible ( plastic ) deformation .",
    "for instance at @xmath38 , while some of the initial deformation relaxes , there is strong permanent ( plastic ) deformation .",
    "for @xmath47 , the cluster bounces and the radius of gyration increases by about 30 % but eventually settles down to a value below that of the cluster that adhered to the surface at @xmath38 .",
    "the total cluster potential energy per atom , @xmath48 , is the sum of cluster internal energy per atom , @xmath49 , and cluster - surface interaction energy per atom , @xmath50 ( the adhesion energy can be defined as @xmath51 ) . as seen in fig .",

    "@xmath49 returns to its precollision value ( fig .",
    "[ pote](b ) ) confirming that the collision is elastic ( as was indicated by the deformation in fig .",
    "likewise , for the two more energetic collisions the change in @xmath49 is permanent , confirming that the collision is largely plastic . in the case of the collision at @xmath22=1.6 which results in adhesion , we see that there is a subsequent relaxation of @xmath50 as the cluster begins to equilibrate with the surface .",
    "we note that the plastic deformation of the clusters during impact leads to a corresponding increase in cluster temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ pote](c ) .",
    "further at both @xmath38 and @xmath36 the clusters reach temperatures above the free cluster melting point ( @xmath52 = 0.33 ) .",
    "an inspection of snapshots of the clusters after impact strongly suggest that indeed the clusters have melted .",
    "finally , the ratios of the kinetic energy to the adhesion energy of the clusters at the pull - off ( which is the point of zero net centre of mass force ) , @xmath53 , are 1.04 , 0.67 and 1.68 for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 collisions respectively . as expected",
    "if @xmath54 the cluster will adhere to the surface whereas if @xmath55 the cluster will be reflected .",
    "we note that for a spherical droplet , this ratio is equivalent to the weber number , _ we _ , often used in fluid mechanics . in the rest of this paper",

    "this is because there are essentially two deformation regimes . for @xmath61 , little deformation occurs , so that the area of contact ( and hence the adhesion energy ) depends only weakly on the incident velocity . at higher velocities",
    "i.e. for @xmath59 , the deformation starts to grow substantially , leading to an increase in contact area ( and adhesion energy ) which depends strongly on velocity . in this strong deformation regime ( @xmath62 )",
    ", the adhesion energy initially dominates the reflected kinetic energy as the deformation produces a larger contact area .",
    "this is evidenced by the increase in adhesion probability between @xmath26 .",
    "eventually , the reflected kinetic energy begins to dominate adhesion ( @xmath63 ) and the probability of adhesion decreases .",

    "this is consistent with a ` pancaking ' of the cluster on the surface ( see the snapshots in fig .",

    "each data point shown in figure represents an average over 100 trials for each cluster size .",
    "the data shows a rough trend for @xmath0 to decrease as the cluster size increases .",
    "@xmath0 is approximately constant for low velocities but shows a strong dependence on velocity at @xmath62 . in this strong deformation regime , the dependence of @xmath0 on velocity varies as @xmath75 for the 147 , 309 and 561-atom icosahedra .",

    "however it is close to the @xmath77 dependence of @xmath0 found by finite - element simulations of strongly plastic collisions @xcite .",
    "thus , we have clearly identified two collision regimes by looking at the cluster at the pull - off point : a low - deformation regime , with a constant coefficient of restitution and adhesion energy , and a strong deformation regime where both @xmath0 and @xmath78 depend strongly on the initial velocity . to understand how this affects the probability of adhesion",

    "the clusters undergo little deformation , and both the adhesion energy and coefficient of restitution are approximately constant . in this low deformation regime",
    "the reflected kinetic energy grows to dominate the adhesion , and consequently the probability of adhesion decreases with impact velocity .",
    "however for @xmath62 , we begin to see substantial deformation of the cluster where both the coefficient of restitution and the adhesion energy depend on the velocity .",
    "initially , the adhesion energy dominates , leading to an increase in adhesion probability .",
    "however , at high velocities the reflected kinetic energy begins to dominate again and the probability of adhesion decreases once more .",
    "figure  [ c_stick ] illustrates the effects of varying the strength of cluster - surface attraction , @xmath8 , showing the adhesion probability of 147-atom icosahedron as a function of the impact velocity .",
    "it is seen that the adhesion probability strongly depends on @xmath8 and the transition from adhesion to reflection of the cluster is observed as the value of @xmath8 is decreased from @xmath8=0.7 to @xmath8=0.2 .",
    "the bimodal behavior of adhesion probability is evident at @xmath79 but disappears outside this range as either the reflected kinetic energy dominates at small @xmath8 or the adhesion energy dominates at large @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the difference in reflection probability for surfaces with different adhesion energies has been exploited for device fabrication @xcite .      finally , we have considered the adhesion of the 147-atom cluster at non - normal angles of incidence for @xmath23 . in fig .",
    "[ obliquestickfigure ] we have plotted the probability of adhesion versus the normal velocity component ( @xmath80 ) at angles from 30 - 90 degrees ( again the cluster was randomly reorientated between each trial ) . note that the probability of adhesion as a function of the normal velocity component for the non - normal collisions is very similar to that of the normal collisions in fig .",
    "[ stickfigure ] .",
    "thus the probability of adhesion is largely determined by the normal component of the incident velocity and hence for the oblique collisions , we define the coefficient of restitution as the ratio of normal velocity components after and before impact : @xmath81 . with this definition , we found that the magnitude and dependence on velocity of the coefficient of restitution in the oblique case was very similar to that seen in the normal incidence case .",
    "indeed , this is consistent with analysis of the angular momentum of the reflected clusters , which shows that they do not gain significant amounts of rotational kinetic energy after the collisions ( typically < 1% of the translational kinetic energy ) even after impacts at highly oblique angles .",
    "however , we would expect the conversion of translational to rotational kinetic energy during collisions to be more important at larger cluster sizes .",
    "figure  [ anglesfigure ] shows the velocity component _ parallel _ to the surface at the end of the simulation averaged over the clusters that _ adhere _ to the surface at @xmath23 ( a ) and @xmath82 ( b ) . at @xmath23",
    "it can be seen that this velocity component is approximately conserved during the collision ( the slope of the fitting line is 0.8 ) so that clusters landing and adhering with velocity components parallel to the surface may be characterized as sliding rather than sticking ( although these clusters are still counted as adhering in fig .",
    "[ obliquestickfigure ] ) . at @xmath82",
    "we see a quite different type of behavior , where there seems to be a threshold velocity for sliding that depends on the angle of incidence .",
    "thus for stronger cluster - surface adhesions , clusters striking the surface away from the normal will stick at low velocities and slide at high velocities ( see ref .",
    "in this section we compare our simulated results with the experimental data for collisions of sb , bi @xcite and cu @xcite clusters with sio@xmath34 surfaces . however , as we have not directly simulated a metal / sio@xmath34 system , and the particle sizes here are smaller than those investigated experimentally , we need to be somewhat circumspect in making this comparison .",
    "thus to gain an understanding of how much of the behavior observed is an artefact of the lennard - jones model used here , it is useful to draw on knowledge of bulk collisions .",
    "in addition , a comparison of our results with bulk collisions is an interesting end in its own right .",
    "we have investigated a collision regime with typical velocities @xmath83 . for ar , with @xmath84 j / atom , this characteristic velocity is @xmath85 ms@xmath86 . as noted in the introduction , the collision of ar clusters with surfaces has been studied previously , both by experiment @xcite and by molecular dynamics simulation @xcite , but at velocities at least an order of magnitude or more larger than those studied here . similarly using the binding energies for sb , bi and cu , we find characteristic velocities of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ms@xmath86 respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was estimated that their @xmath90 nm sb and bi clusters had impact velocities of 65 and 45 ms@xmath86 respectively , and that their @xmath91 nm cu clusters had velocities of approximately 230 ms@xmath86 .",
    "thus , as a fraction of their cohesive energies , the kinetic energies of the clusters in the experimental deposition of sb , bi and cu clusters are an order of magnitude or more below the scales studied here .",
    "however , from a macropscopic point of view the outcome of a collision ( reflection or adhesion ) will be determined by the weber number _",
    "we_@xmath92 which depends not only on velocity but also cluster size and the cluster - substrate interaction strength .",
    "indeed this is certainly the case in our simulations as discussed in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , our simulations show that the way in which _ we _ depends on these parameters in turn depends on whether the collisions are in the weak or the strong deformation regimes . again , this is to be expected based on macroscopic considerations @xcite .",
    "thus to best compare the experiments and our simulations we must compare weber numbers , and to do this we need to know whether the collisions in the experimental system are in the weak or strong deformation regime . in what follows ,",
    "we will focus on estimating the weber number for @xmath90 nm sb clusters with estimated deposition velocities of 65 ms@xmath86 .",
    "dimensional analysis suggests the onset velocity for strong plastic deformation , @xmath93 , should scale as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the yield stress and @xmath96 is the density of the particle .",
    "indeed , finite element simulations of collisions in bulk systems@xcite suggest that a transition between elasto - plastic and fully plastic deformations occurs at velocities @xmath97 . in bulk polycrystalline solids @xmath95",
    "is typically smaller by a factor of @xmath98 than @xmath99 , the shear modulus @xcite . for sb , by assuming that the yield stress is roughly @xmath98 of the bulk shear modulus , we estimate that @xmath100 ms@xmath86 .",
    "thus based on the use of bulk material parameters , it seems likely that the sb collisions in ref  @xcite occurred in a strongly plastic , large deformation regime .    to compare this analysis with the behavior of our simulated our system",
    ", we need to estimate @xmath95 for our clusters . recalling fig .",
    "[ corfigure ] , we note that in the small deformation regime the coefficient of restitution was constant , whereas in the large deformation regime the @xmath0 exhibits a strong dependence on velocity : @xmath101 .",
    "as noted earlier , this is a much stronger dependence on velocity than that given by hertzian contact mechanics @xcite but is close to the @xmath77 dependence found by the finite - element simulations of strongly plastic collisions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the quadratic dependence of the deformation at pull - off on velocity ( fig .  [ deformfigure ] ) is consistent with strong plastic deformation , where the kinetic energy is dissipated largely at the cluster yield stress , @xmath95 i.e. the plastic work @xmath102 is proportional to the translational kinetic energy @xmath103 so that @xmath104 as is found in fig .  [ deformfigure ] .",
    "we have found that this relationship is relatively insensitive to both the values of @xmath8 and the cluster sizes examined here .",
    "this now allows us to estimate @xmath95 for the clusters studied here .",
    "instead of the deformation at pull - off ( shown in figure  [ deformfigure ] ) , we use the maximum deformation during the collision to estimate @xmath95 , which is also found to be proportional to the initial particle kinetic energy . if we equate the plastic work to the total kinetic energy , we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",

    "@xcite ) so we have here that @xmath111 which is close to the ideal critical shear stress @xmath112 .",
    "we suspect that there are a several factors that contribute to this relatively large value of @xmath95 .",
    "firstly , the use of pair potentials such as that in equation ( [ potential ] ) is known to lead to simulated materials that are ` brittle ' , in the sense that the onset of plastic deformation only occurs at stresses close to the point of fracture @xcite .",
    "we also note that many body effects will lead to more anisotropic elastic behaviour @xcite but in particles of this size we expect that the anisotropy of the particle structure itself ( i.e the icosahedral structure with edges , facets and vertices ) will dominate such anisotropic elastic effects . secondly , the usual mechanisms for plastic deformation that occur in bulk materials , such as the nucleation and propagation of dislocations , are unlikely to operate at the cluster sizes studied here .",
    "indeed , molecular dynamics simulations of metallic nanowires @xcite have found yield stresses and young s moduli considerably above those of the corresponding bulk materials ( e.g. @xmath113 with failure occurring via amorphization@xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , we expect that @xmath95 will be shear rate dependent ( again see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and that the very large shear rates in our collisions may lead to higher values of @xmath95 .",
    "finally , our estimate really represents an upper bound on @xmath95 as significant proportion of the incident energy will be be dissipated by the substrate .    in our simulations",
    ", we saw the onset of large plastic deformations at @xmath114 at all sizes . based on our estimate of @xmath95 above , we find that @xmath115 which is consistent with refs .  @xcite . for sb ,",
    "as noted earlier , we estimate that @xmath100 ms@xmath86 using bulk material parameters .",
    "nonetheless , if the yield stresses of these sb particles are significantly larger than @xmath116 , as we found in our simulated clusters , then @xmath93 could be as large as @xmath117 ms@xmath86 .",
    "however , in what follows we will proceed with the assumption that the experimental collisions took place in a large deformation , strongly plastic regime as we expect that sb clusters are likely to considerably more ductile relative to their binding energies than lennard - jones clusters .",
    "transitions between adhesion and reflection can evidently occur in either the weak or strong deformation regimes or both ( see fig .",
    "[ c_stick ] ) . in the small deformation regime",
    "hertz s contact law for macroscopic bodies @xcite suggests that the contact area should scale as @xmath118 so that @xmath119 ( since @xmath120 is the adhesion energy per cluster atom ) .",
    "however , for velocities @xmath71 in the small deformation regime we find that @xmath121 ( see fig .  [ eavsv](c ) ) .",
    "thus , if we take the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 to be independent of cluster size , @xmath122 in this regime .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to the liquid droplet model @xcite used in ref  @xcite to explain the transition from adhesion to reflection in their experiments .    however at impact velocities above @xmath123 , in the strong deformation regime , we find that @xmath120 scales as @xmath124 .",
    "this is consistent with pancaking of the cluster on the surface .",
    "it is likely that in the experimental system @xmath120 scales as an inverse power of @xmath125 with exponent somewhere between the value of @xmath126 which comes from the macroscopic hertz contact law ( which is admittedly only expected to be valid for small deformations ) and the value of @xmath127 seen in the simulations .",
    "for the purposes of making a comparison here , we use the latter value obtained from the simulations .",
    "thus in the strong deformation regime , using the macroscopic coefficient of restituion for strong plastic deformation @xmath128 @xcite , @xmath129 ( see section  [ sec : pstick ] ) and @xmath130 , we find that @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the cluster - substrate adhesion energy per unit area .",
    "thus we expect the adhesion - reflection transition to occur at a velocity @xmath133 given by : @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "the dimensionless groupings on the left and right - hand sides of this expression are quite natural and we would expect these to occur in the description of a reflection - adhesion in any system undergoing plastic deformation .",
    "however , as noted above , the scaling with @xmath125 might vary from system to system , depending on the nature of the adhesive forces involved .",
    "nonetheless , in what follows we will use ( [ vcrit ] ) to estimate @xmath133 .    assuming that the contact angles measured by sem imaging in ref .",
    "@xcite are in fact the equilibrium contact angles , the adhesion energy can be determined using the surface energy of the metal .",
    "the measured contact angle of @xmath32 for sb on sio@xmath34 corresponds to an adhesion energy of @xmath136 jm@xmath137 , where we have used the surface energy for sb given in ref .",
    "thus in a @xmath90 nm sb cluster , if we assume that @xmath95 is @xmath138 of the bulk shear modulus , @xmath139 ms@xmath86 on sio@xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sb clusters with deposition velocities of 65 ms@xmath86 were reflected from planar surfaces . in the etched v - grooves , the clusters are incident at @xmath140 to the substrate plane , giving a normal velocity component of 35 ms@xmath86 which should still result in the clusters being reflected .",
    "however , in the v - groove reflected clusters will almost certainly undergo a second impact on the opposite side of the v - groove .",
    "this secondary impact is much more likely to lead to adhesion .",
    "thus the experimental results for sb in ref .",
    "@xcite seem best explained by adhesion following secondary collisions , suggesting that devices can be assembled by depositing clusters well above the transition velocity @xmath133 , leading to secondary collisions in a v - groove which occur below @xmath133 .",
    "finally , we note that there will be _ at least _ two critical velocities for cluster collisions : the velocity @xmath141 which marks the transition between the weak and strong deformation regimes , and the _ velocities _ @xmath133 which give @xmath142 . at these velocities @xmath133 , which can occur in the both the weak and strong deformation regimes as seen in fig .",
    "[ weber ] , there will be a transition between reflection and adhesion . in our simulated system , this reentrant transition occurs where @xmath143 when @xmath144 .",
    "[ c_stick ] shows that a similar situation arises for @xmath145 .",
    "in fact this reentrant transition occurs for those values of @xmath8 where the weber number is near one at the velocity @xmath141 . in other words , if the transition to strong deformation during the collisions occurs at the point where the low deformation collisions have just started to overcome the adhesive forces , particles will begin to adhere once more to the surface due to the increase in adhesion . from equation ( @xmath146 ) , we see that @xmath147 so that for any particular cluster - substrate system , reentrant adhesion is possible in clusters with radii @xmath148 . in our system , for the cluster sizes we consider ,",
    "@xmath149 when @xmath150 . in sb clusters on the sio@xmath34 surface",
    ", this suggests that @xmath149 when @xmath151 nm ( we note that @xmath152 in the 12.5 nm sb clusters according to ( [ eqn : weber ] ) )",
    ". thus it may be possible to observe a reentrant transition in @xmath151 nm sb clusters .",
    "using molecular dynamics simulations of lennard - jones clusters over a range of velocities , we have observed two collision regimes on weakly attractive substrates in which cluster reflection can occur . at low velocities",
    "we find an elastic collision regime , where the cluster progresses from adhesion to reflection as the reflected kinetic energy of the cluster overcomes the adhesion energy . at higher velocities",
    "the cluster begins to deform plastically . initially in this plastic regime the adhesion energy grows faster than the reflected kinetic energy leading to an increase in adhesion probability .",
    "however , eventually the reflected kinetic energy grows to dominate the adhesion energy and the adhesion probability decreases once more . as our simulations in this strong deformation regime are consistent with strongly plastic contact mechanics , we propose an expression for the critical velocity for the reflection - adhesion transition in this regime . using bulk material parameters",
