    "the wavelength of the ground state hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) in atoms and ions is typically in the microwave domain and thus not accessible with lasers .",
    "however , the energy of the @xmath0 ground state hfs of hydrogen - like ions scales with the atomic number @xmath1 as @xmath2 and shifts into the laser - accessible region above @xmath3 @xcite . at the same time , the upper state lifetime scales as @xmath4 and eventually shifts into a region where acceptable fluorescence rates from magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions can be expected .",
    "this allows for accurate measurements of the transition by means of laser spectroscopy and in turn for sensitive tests of corresponding calculations of the transition energy and lifetime @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ground state hfs in hydrogen - like ions has until now been observed experimentally in only a few species : @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , two measurements of the @xmath10 ground state hfs in lithium - like ions have been attempted .",
    "both measurements were performed on @xmath11 and the results are inconclusive @xcite .",
    "the above measurements have been carried out at a strorage ring @xcite and a common experimental obstacle has been the effect of the doppler width and shift of the transition due to the relativistic velocities of the ions .",
    "the measurements performed in an ebit ( electron beam ion trap ) @xcite are not as severely subject to this effect , but suffer from a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the measurement scheme outlined here has the advantage that it takes place in cryogenic surroundings with well - localised particles nearly at rest .",
    "this reduces the doppler width and shift to a level of 10@xmath12 of the measured transition , which is three orders of magnitude lower than in any previous experiment .",
    "furthermore , by use of a rotating wall@xcite , a high ion number density can be obtained which , together with the localisation , increases the intensity of the measured fluorescence .",
    "this instrument is to be used within the framework of the hitrap project @xcite at the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) in germany .",
    "the highly charged ions will be produced by the experimental storage ring ( esr ) , subsequently slowed and cooled , and finally made available at low energies for experiments .    in section [ sectwo ]",
    "we discuss the theoretical background to this area before describing the proposed instrument and measurement techniques in sections [ secthree ] and [ secfour ] .",
    "hfs calculations have been performed for a number of hydrogen - like ions @xcite ; the most accurate ones are given for the isotopes listed above . as a first approximation , good within 4 % , the hfs of the @xmath13s@xmath14 ground state of hydrogen - like ions is given by @xcite : @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fine structure constant , @xmath18 is the nuclear @xmath19-factor ( with @xmath20 the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath21 the nuclear magneton ) , @xmath22 the nuclear angular momentum , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the electron and proton mass respectively , and @xmath25 is the speed of light . equation ( [ one ] ) represents the normal ground state hfs multiplied by a correction @xmath26 for the relativistic energy of the @xmath0 electron , where @xmath27 is related to the angular momentum @xmath28 of the electron . to account for the charge distribution of the nucleus , a first order approximation",
    "is made by assuming that the charge is evenly distributed over the volume of the spherical nucleus .",
    "this finite - size correction is given by the factor @xmath29 in equation ( [ one ] ) .",
    "the values for @xmath30 have been taken from @xcite , those for @xmath31 and @xmath22 were taken from @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath8 for example , are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding m1 transition is between the ( lower ) @xmath35 and ( upper ) @xmath36 hyperfine states .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the corresponding transition wavelengths between the upper and lower hyperfine level of the ground state for different hydrogen - like and lithium - like ions . only isotopes with a lifetime longer than one hour are depicted .",
    "the wavelength region is restricted to the range accessible with readily available laser systems .",
    "the figure illustrates that a large number of isotopes can be studied .",
    "the main uncertainty in the hfs calculations is caused by the bohr - weisskopf effect @xcite , which is due to the finite spatial distribution of the nuclear magnetisation .",
    "this limitation can be circumvented by a comparison of the ground state hfs in a hydrogen - like ion and its lithium - like counterpart which to first order rules out all nuclear effects and allows for bound - state qed effects to be isolated @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , a measurement of the hfs transition in a series of isotopes of the same hydrogen - like species rules out the effects of charge and isolates nuclear properties which can be probed with the single electron .",
    "when the results from equation ( [ one ] ) are compared with experimental values @xcite , the difference ( @xmath37 4% ) is found to increase with @xmath1 and equation ( [ one ] ) generally underestimates the experimental values .",
    "this is mostly attributed to the bohr - weisskopf effect and to qed contributions ( vacuum polarisation and self - energy ) @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath38pb@xmath39 the measured wavelength is 1019.7(2)nm @xcite , while a full calculation including all the above corrections gives 1020(4)nm @xcite .    similarly to equation ( [ one ] )",
    ", the hfs of the @xmath40s@xmath14 ground state for lithium - like ions is given by @xmath41 with the relativistic correction @xmath42 the values for @xmath11 for example , are @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding m1 transition is between the ( lower ) @xmath46 and ( upper ) @xmath47 hyperfine states .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in figure [ fig1 ] as open symbols .",
    "the corrections to the values from equation ( [ three ] ) are estimated to be about 4% in this case as well . from x - ray measurements in @xmath48bi@xmath49 a tentative hfs transition wavelength of 1512",
    "nm was derived by subtraction of two measured x - ray transitions yielding the wavelength of the hfs - transition @xcite .",
    "calculations following this experiment predicted 1582 nm @xcite , 1564 nm @xcite and 1554 nm @xcite . a second direct measurement aimed for the latter value , but no resonance within the predicted limits was found @xcite .",
    "a definitive measurement is therefore very desirable .",
    "for these experiments a cylindrical open endcap penning trap @xcite , with an additional capture electrode at both ends , has been chosen .",
    "the ring electrode is axially split into four segments to allow for the rotating wall technique @xcite to be used .",
    "the trap is to be enclosed in a vacuum container at liquid helium temperature , which ensures efficient cryopumping .",
    "the estimated residual gas pressure inside the trap is below 10@xmath50 pa .",
    "this value is estimated from measured trapping times of highly - charged ions in a similar trap . trapping is ensured by an electrostatic trapping potential across the trap and a static homogeneous axial magnetic field . as will be discussed below",
    ", it appears feasible to work with a magnetic flux density below 1 t .",
    "for such a penning trap experiment , typically a superconducting magnet would be used .",
    "however , fields as low as 1 t could also be produced by permanent magnets , which are advantageous in terms of size and cost .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a schematic of the trap structure .",
    "further details are given in @xcite .",
    "in the proposed experiment , an externally produced bunch of roughly @xmath51 ions at an energy of a few ev is loaded into the trap along the axis , _ i.e. _ along the magnetic field lines .",
    "it is captured in flight @xcite , confined , resistively cooled and then radially compressed by the rotating wall technique . if necessary , several bunches of ions can be accumulated in the trap @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy laser driving the hyperfine transition is run in a continuous - wave mode and enters the trap axially through an open - endcap .",
    "the laser beam is shaped such that it illuminates the full radial cross section of the ion cloud .",
    "the fluorescence is detected perpendicular to the cooled axial motion ( trap axis ) .",
    "the axial motion is resistively cooled by a resonant circuit attached to the endcaps .",
    "the ion motion induces image charges in the endcaps and causes an oscillating current to flow through the resonant circuit , which is tuned to the axial trapping frequency and effectively dissipates the ions kinetic energy .",
    "the resistance of the circuit thus leads to a damping of the ion motion amplitude .",
    "the induced current is proportional to the ion velocity and therefore the dissipated power is proportional to the kinetic energy . for a single particle",
    "there is an exponential energy decrease , which is given by @xcite @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the particle charge , @xmath54 its mass and @xmath55 is the effective distance between the endcaps @xcite . in resonance ,",
    "the impedance of an lc - circuit is real and acts as an ohmic resistor with resistance @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the quality factor of the circuit and @xmath58 the inductance .",
    "the axial frequency @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the trapping potential .",
    "for cryogenic lc - circuits typical values are @xmath62 , @xmath63mh , and @xmath64pf , so that at axial frequencies around 1mhz the resonance resistance is of the order of 1m@xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding bandwidth of the filter , defined as @xmath66 , is about 2khz .",
    "the resistive cooling time constant , expressed in terms of the filter components , is given by @xmath67 deviations from the exponential cooling behaviour may occur when the dissipated power is not proportional to the kinetic energy of the ions .",
    "for example , if the axial frequency @xmath59 depends on the ions kinetic energy , @xmath59 may move out of resonance with the lc - circuit . for large amplitudes",
    "the motion is no longer harmonic since higher order multipole components in the trapping potential may become significant @xcite .",
    "the quality factor @xmath57 of the resonant circuit thus needs to be chosen such that both cooling time and bandwidth are optimal .",
    "ions as a function of the axial frequency . also shown",
    "is the shift due to space charge effects ( section [ spce ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the resonant circuit stays tuned to the axial frequency.,width=226 ]    in a cloud of ions , only the common centre - of - mass - mode ( c.m .- mode ) is cooled resistively with high efficiency @xcite .",
    "this is easily understood for the so - called breathing mode , where the centre of the charges is stationary and therefore ( to first order ) no current is induced . however , through intra - cloud interactions , such as ion - ion collisions , energy transfer between the ions occurs thus creating motional fluctuations which induce currents leading to energy dissipation from the motion .",
    "the final temperature is determined by electronic noise present in the resonant circuit , which effectively heats the ion cloud @xcite .",
    "the electronic noise temperature can significantly exceed the ambient temperature @xcite , and we therefore assume an axial ion temperature of 10k , instead of 4.2k .",
    "the c.m .- motion of an ion cloud obeys the single particle equation ( [ five ] ) . to first order @xmath68",
    "does not depend on the number of ions under the condition that the distribution of axial frequencies is smaller than the bandwidth of the resonant circuit @xcite .",

    "this is the largest fraction and it results in the initial fast decrease of the total noise power in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the cooling time constant ( around 132ms ) is equal to the one measured for an ion cloud with low kinetic energy in a harmonic trap . on longer timescales ,",
    "the dominant cooling process is the energy dissipation from the non - c.m .- modes .",
    "this has a measured value of @xmath72s , which is more than one order of magnitude longer than for the c.m .- mode . for the planned experiments , we expect @xmath68-values of several tens of seconds .",

[ dens ] ) and related properties of the cloud are governed by its global rotation frequency @xmath74 . this is the case if the debye length @xmath75 is much smaller than any of the cloud dimensions .",

    "the cloud rotation is driven by the electric field produced by a rotating dipole . to this end ,",
    "sinusoidal ac - voltages with a fixed phase shift are applied to the different ring segments of the trap @xcite .",
    "the rotating wall technique was first applied to increase the cloud density of a laser cooled ion cloud in order to observe crystallisation @xcite .",
    "the resulting cloud compression is due to the lorentz force directed towards the trap centre .",
    "the final density results from a balance between the lorentz force and the coulomb force between the ions .",

    "<S> we propose a novel type of precision laser spectrometer for trapped , highly charged ions nearly at rest . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a cylindrical open - endcap penning trap in which an externally produced bunch of highly charged ions can be confined and investigated by means of laser spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of confinement , cooling and compression of a dense ion cloud will allow the ground state hyperfine splitting in highly charged ions to be measured with an accuracy three orders of magnitude better than in any previous experiment . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic study of different charge states and different isotopes of the same element allows for highly sensitive tests of bound - state qed and for a precision determination of nuclear properties . </S>",
    "<S> apart from stable isotopes , also radioactive species with half - lives longer than about one hour can be investigated . </S>"
