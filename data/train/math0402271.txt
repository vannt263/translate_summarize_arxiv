    "first , note that two consecutive @xmath138 s in ( [ word ] ) might come from the same expansion block in the parent , which is the reason for the third term in the definition of @xmath184 in case 3 of step 3 .",
    "secondly , note that the terms @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which appear with a negative sign in @xmath127 when @xmath145 , are also needed in the cancellation process above .",
    "indeed , these words are special cases of ( [ word ] ) , cf . cases a@xmath254 and b@xmath254 above .    the terms in the second class can be cancelled by a procedure similar to the one in step 4.1 .",
    "in fact , this case is easier because no expansion blocks containing @xmath138 are involved .",
    "we show that the terms in the third class cancel in pairs .",
    "a son of @xmath136 in the third class is obtained by replacing all expansion blocks @xmath153 with @xmath258 for some @xmath259 with @xmath260 ( cf .",
    "cases 1 , 2 , and 4 in step 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the labeling ensures that if @xmath261 , then the first @xmath138 is preceded by a letter @xmath262 , and if @xmath263 , then the last @xmath138 is followed by a letter @xmath264 . if there is an initial expansion block @xmath197 , it will be replaced by @xmath265 ; again , the last @xmath138 has to be followed by a letter @xmath264 .",
    "similarly for a possible expansion block ending in @xmath138 .",
    "let us now replace each adjacent pair @xmath266 in the son by @xmath267 and each @xmath268 by @xmath269 ( cf .",
    "cases @xmath220 , @xmath222 , and @xmath227 in step 3 ) .",
    "we obtain a word of the form @xmath175 with no @xmath138 s , up to trivial commutations given by relation ( 4 ) in the definition of @xmath173 ; indeed , the labeling ensures that the order of the letters is the correct one .",
    "hence @xmath136 and @xmath175 have two identical sons ( which we pair up ) ; furthermore , their signs are the same , namely @xmath270 , where @xmath152 is the number of adjacent pairs @xmath266 in the sons . finally , it is easy to see that all sons in the third class of a typical term @xmath175 containing no @xmath138 s arise in the way mentioned above , and are paired up uniquely .",
    "_ proof of the general case of lemma [ lem1 ] .",
    "_ this follows from the special case of the lemma .",
    "let @xmath271 , with @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 .",
    "assume that both @xmath275 and @xmath276 are nonempty , because otherwise we are in the special case above .",
    "we have @xmath277 where the first summation ranges over all quadruples of sets @xmath278 satisfying    * @xmath279 @xmath280 ; * @xmath281 ; * @xmath282 and @xmath283 , @xmath284 ;    the second summation ranges over all quadruples of sets @xmath285 satisfying the conditions obtained from the ones above upon substitutions @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 .    applying the special case of the lemma , and assuming that @xmath289 are fixed , we have that @xmath290 here the first summation ranges over all @xmath291 satisfying the conditions above , and the second summation ranges over @xmath292 satisfying @xmath293 and @xmath294 . taking into account the case when @xmath295 or @xmath296 , we can write the first summation in ( [ comm ] ) as @xmath297 here the summations range over quadruples @xmath298 satisfying    * @xmath299 @xmath280 ; * @xmath300 ; * @xmath301 .    by a similar procedure , the second summation in ( [ comm ] )",
    "can be written in the same way , whence @xmath302 .",
    "we now present the @xmath0-theory versions of ( [ cor1 ] ) and conjecture [ conj1 ] .",
    "1 .   corollary [ strconst ] is a new approach to the study of the @xmath0-theory structure constants @xmath307 , which is superior to the one based only on theorem [ kmonk ] .",
    "indeed , note first that the littlewood - richardson problem in @xmath0-theory is reduced to simplifying @xmath308 , by using the relations of the quadratic algebra .",
    "let us also note that , essentially , we are simultaneously deriving the rules for multiplying @xmath309 by _ all _ grothendieck polynomials . in order to better understand this fact ,",
    "let us label a cover @xmath310 in bruhat order by the pair @xmath311 , and , based on corollary [ strconst ] , let us think of @xmath307 as counting certain saturated chains from @xmath37 to @xmath17 , which are determined by @xmath312 .",
    "the above procedure has the advantage that we are considering the saturated chains with the same sequences of labels just once , rather than for each relevant grothendieck polynomial @xmath313 by which we multiply @xmath309 .",
    "the importance of corollary [ strconst ] is also underlied by the next remark , as well as by conjecture [ nonnk ] , as discussed in the fourth remark below . 2 .",
    "working in the quadratic algebra rather than in its bruhat representation makes sense , because its relations are simpler ( the complete list of relations for the bruhat representation is not even known ) , and stronger results are revealed , such as theorem [ commute ] and , possibly , conjecture [ nonnk ] .",
    "conjecture [ nonnk ] implies that @xmath314 , as proved by brion in @xcite .",
    "but the conjecture does not appear to follow from brion s result .",
    "a. yong @xcite checked the conjecture for @xmath315 .",
    "4 .   if conjecture [ nonnk ] is true , then a combinatorial description of @xmath308 as an alternating linear combination of monomials in @xmath49 $ ] with @xmath68 would immediately lead to a combinatorial description of the @xmath0-theory structure constants @xmath307 , for all @xmath37 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that a similar approach led to a proof of the pieri - type formula for the cohomology of the flag variety in @xcite .",
    "fomin and kirillov proved in @xcite that the subalgebra of the quadratic algebra @xmath47 generated by the dunkl elements is isomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "the author and a. yong @xcite conjectured that @xmath5 can be realized in a similar way , as a different commutative subalgebra of the _ same _ quadratic algebra , based on the @xmath0-theoretic dunkl elements .",
    "we have checked this conjecture for @xmath319 . clearly , the main result of this paper is a step in this direction . on the other hand ,",
    "we have proved other related results , including the fact that the @xmath0-theoretic dunkl elements sum to 0 . however ,",
    "completing the proof of the conjecture will require much more effort .",
    "indeed , its cohomology counterpart in @xcite is already somewhat complex , while passage from cohomology to @xmath0-theory seems to involve a dramatic increase in complexity , as suggested by the proof of theorem [ commute ] ."
