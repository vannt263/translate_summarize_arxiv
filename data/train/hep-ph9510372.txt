    "for a year or so evidence has been getting stronger for two deviations from the standard model .",
    "one is an excess of about @xmath8 in the @xmath9 decays to @xmath10 ( using the value reported  @xcite when the charm quark width is fixed at its standard model value , for reasons explained below ) denoted by @xmath11 , and the second that the @xmath5 measured from the @xmath9 line width at lep differs from that determined other ways  @xcite . for the first , the effect is even larger  @xcite if one uses unconstrained data ( @xmath12 ) . also , these numbers are for @xmath13 ; the deviation between theory and experiment increases as @xmath14 if one uses larger @xmath15 .",
    "experimentally these are logically independent deviations  for example , if the excess @xmath16 were due to including charm decays in the @xmath17 sample , there would be no effect on @xmath5 since the total hadronic width would be unchanged",
    ". theoretically they are also logically independent .",
    "for example , if the predicted @xmath18 in a model were lowered by high scale threshold effects or intermediate scale matter multiplets , there would be no necessary increase in @xmath11 .",
    "if these are true deviations they are the long - awaited clues to physics beyond the standard model !    from a supersymmetric view these two deviations are natural and expected . the standard model value for @xmath11 is the tree value minus about a @xmath19 effect from the @xmath20 loop ( proportional to @xmath14 ) .",
    "the corresponding susy stop - chargino loop naturally has the opposite sign of the @xmath20 loop , and approximately cancels it if the stop and chargino are light enough .",
    "further , if the excess @xmath9 decays are due to a new mechanism such as a stop - chargino loop , then this contribution must be included when the increase in the @xmath9 width is used to determine @xmath18 ; when that is done the @xmath18 deviation also goes away , and @xmath18 from the @xmath9 line width decreases to about .112 , consistent with its determination other ways  @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of the @xmath18 deviation considerably strengthens one s confidence that both deviations are real , and also that the susy explanation is perhaps correct .",
    "it has been confirmed with global fits to all the precision data  @xcite that including the susy contributions does not lead to disagreement with any observable , and indeed that susy gives a better global fit to the data than the standard model .    in this paper",
    "we argue that if the @xmath11 deviation is indeed real , then several consequences follow .",
    "( 1 ) most important , stop and chargino must be light enough to be detected when the energy of lep is increased to over 140 gev , as expected during 1995 , if sufficient luminosity is obtained ( over about @xmath21 ) . to put it differently ,",
    "if a stop or chargino is not found , then either the @xmath11 excess will go away , or if it persists the susy explanation is not relevant and there are different effects that change @xmath11 . ( 2 ) by combining the @xmath11 effects with other data we can show that @xmath11 can only be explained in susy if @xmath1 is of order 1 .",
    "earlier arguments  @xcite that perhaps large @xmath1 and an @xmath22 loop with small @xmath23 could also explain @xmath11 can be excluded . (",
    "3 ) since the stop is lighter than the top there will be a decay of top to stop plus the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) .",
    "we show the branching ratio for this decay must be large , about 0.4 .",
    "( 4 ) the upper limit on @xmath3 decreases considerably , making its detection at lep and/or fnal more probable .",
    "all of this analysis is essentially model and parameter independent . while many of the relevant quantities depend on masses and couplings , we vary them over all values allowed by constraints , and make no assumptions about them .",
    "the only assumption is that there are no other contributions except those coming from standard model particles and their superpartners .",
    "there is no dependence on the form of the theory at a high scale , on supersymmetry breaking , etc .",
    ", and no assumption of a mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model )  @xcite . we do feel that it is appropriate to restrict @xmath24 from perturbativity requirements on the top quark yukawa and other experimental considerations .",
    "also , we have not included gluino / sbottom diagrams  @xcite in our calculations since we expect these to be well below the neutralino / sbottom and chargino / stop contributions .",
    "the results do have implications for the form that models and the high scale theory can take , and a fifth consequence ( in addition to the 4 above ) is that there are at least three independent ways in which the high scale theory must differ from the mssm .",
    "the mssm is excluded if the @xmath11 excess is true .",
    "greater than @xmath25 deviations from the standard model have been reported for @xmath26 and for @xmath27 .",
    "supersymmetry has no natural way to explain these , and the susy prediction is that they will go away .",
    "lest the reader think we are arbitrarily choosing our deviations , we note that for @xmath26 the reported deviation is over a @xmath28 effect ( compared to about @xmath19 for @xmath11 where the @xmath14 dependence leads one to expect a large effect ) , and we are confident that no mechanism could give such a huge effect without being detected other ways .",
    "@xmath26 has no significant @xmath14 contribution .",
    "thus any effect for @xmath26 should be well within its current reported @xmath29 errors , and that is why we quote the data with @xmath26 constrained to its standard model value above ( which is conservative in any case ) . for @xmath30",
    "the errors are a few @xmath31 while the size of the expected effects in susy is less than @xmath32 .",
    "also , contributions to @xmath11 are sensitive to the left - handed couplings of @xmath17 to @xmath9 , while the asymmetry is most sensitive to the right - handed coupling , which will be smaller . in both cases",
    "the present errors are well above any possible loop effect .",
    "figure 1 shows the region of stop and chargino masses where a @xmath33 of .003 or more can be obtained .",
    "we think .003 is a good value to use as a criterion to explain @xmath33 .",
    "the standard model gives @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and the reported @xmath11 value for charm constrained to its standard model value is @xmath36  @xcite , so the @xmath37 lower limit is @xmath38 above the standard model . also , the effect on the lep @xmath18 is about @xmath39 , so a change of @xmath38 in @xmath11 would yield a change of @xmath40 in @xmath18 .",
    "this is exactly what is needed to get the @xmath5 extracted using the @xmath9 line shape down to about @xmath41 ( from @xmath42 ) where other ways of determining @xmath18 lead us to expect it .",
    "the line in figure 1 is plotted for @xmath35 gev and for @xmath43 .",
    "a rule is given in the caption for scaling to other @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "this region is obtained by varying all parameters over values that do not lead to a contradiction with theory or data , for each combination of stop and chargino masses .",
    "a point inside the region @xmath44 gives @xmath44 for some values of other parameters , though not necessarily for all .",
    "a point outside does not give @xmath45 for any parameter values .",
    "the chargino cross - section is large enough at lep so chargino pairs could be copiously produced nearly up to the kinematic limit  @xcite with several pb@xmath46 of integrated luminosity regardless of the values of other parameters .",
    "note that if the chargino is not detected below about @xmath47 , then the stop mass should be lighter than 60 gev .",
    "stop cross - sections are smaller , but with over @xmath48 perhaps a few stop events could be detected  @xcite .",
    "thus if the @xmath11 excess is real and lep takes data at or above 140 gev and over about @xmath48 , charginos and/or stops can be detected if susy is relevant to understanding @xmath11 !",
    "we do not have space for a detailed analysis of chargino or stop signatures at lep , but a few points should be made .",
    "we do not have any firm arguments about whether stop or chargino is lighter .",
    "if the chargino is heavy enough to decay to @xmath49 , then the chargino pair final state gives @xmath50 , and stop pairs give @xmath51 ; there are no leptons at all , though the usual susy acoplanarity and acolinearity are present ( @xmath52 is the lsp , and @xmath53 the light stop mass eigenstate ) .",
    "as charginos get lighter so that decay to @xmath49 is excluded , they should have a large branching ratio to a charged lepton , albeit a rather soft one .",
    "if @xmath54 , then the chargino pairs give two charged leptons , two @xmath55 s , and two @xmath52 s , or four jets plus two @xmath52 s , while the stop pairs give @xmath56 .",
    "for much of the parameter space with sufficiently large @xmath33 we expect that lep1.5 will discover a chargino or stop .",
    "however , it is possible that the luminosity or center of mass energy will be too low to detect them in some portions of parameter space .",
    "then lep2 would be required .",
    "perhaps the optimal energy of lep2 for these purposes would be slightly less than the @xmath57 threshold , in order to reduce the background to susy chargino events .",
    "earlier studies  @xcite have sometimes argued that a susy loop containing the pseudoscalar ( @xmath59 ) and scalar higgs bosons ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) could , if @xmath1 were sufficiently large , give a large contribution to @xmath11 . and when the contributions due to chargino / stop and neutralino / sbottom loops are added , a significant enhancement of @xmath11 is possible . however , there are a number of constraints that must be examined .",
    "these include the decay @xmath62  @xcite since the strength of the @xmath63 vertex is proportional to @xmath1 , so if @xmath64 the rate is enhanced by over 3600 ; @xmath65  @xcite ; and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "it turns out that at the present time the first two of these give the strongest constraints , and are sufficient to exclude the large @xmath1 + small @xmath23 solution .",
    "the others may in the future strengthen this case , and data on all of these should be improved .",
    "figure 2 shows these constraints .",
    "the approximately vertical lines are shown labeled by the numbers of @xmath70 ) events that would have been seen .",
    "we are not yet aware of published data on this , but we think that if 20 - 30 such events had been produced it is likely to have been noticed , so we assume the allowed region in the @xmath1-@xmath23 plane is to the right of those lines .",
    "the calculation of  @xcite shows that the observed rate for @xmath71 requires that @xmath72 .",
    "this gives a constraint on @xmath23note that some model dependence enters into this constraint that could be changed if the higgs sector were non - minimal in an unexpected way .",
    "the tree level constraint follows from the sum rule @xmath73 .",
    "this relation must be radiatively corrected by loop effects , and the corrections are large if @xmath1 is large  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown as the approximately horizontal line in the figure ; the region above the line is excluded . but to explain @xmath33 the parameters must be in the region above the .003 line , which does not overlap with the allowed region .",
    "it was shown previously  @xcite that to explain @xmath33 required either @xmath74 or very large .",
    "therefore susy can only explain @xmath33 for @xmath1 about 1 .",
    "this has a number of important consequences .",
    "it allows @xmath75 unification , but excludes @xmath76 unification of yukawa couplings .",
    "the large top mass must be due to a large top yukawa coupling .",
    "it is consistent with an interesting explanation for the @xmath77 parameter  @xcite .",
    "it lowers the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson ( see below ) .",
    "it allows the lsp to have a large higgsino component ( as needed for @xmath11  @xcite ) without disagreeing with the invisible width of the @xmath9 .",
    "the lsp is lighter than the chargino .",
    "since the sum of our upper limits on stop and chargino are less than @xmath15 , top will necessarily decay to @xmath78 with little kinematic suppression . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite this lightest stop must be mostly the superpartner of the right - handed top , and the light chargino and neutralinos must be mostly higgsino - like .",
    "this , together with the requirement that @xmath79 , largely determines the couplings between the light stop and higgsinos .",
    "we find that the branching ratio for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is mostly lsp ) is larger than 0.4 for all allowed choices of parameters , so it should be seen at fnal once it is looked for .",
    "if stop is heavier than chargino it will decay to @xmath82 ; if not , to @xmath83 . we do not have room here to go through signatures and a detailed analysis , but we note several points .",
    "cdf has published a branching ratio of @xmath84  @xcite for @xmath85 .",
    "but that analysis was for a sample with a @xmath86 leptonic decay trigger , so it does not apply to some events with a decay to @xmath87 , and without detailed analysis it is not clear what fraction of decays to stop could pass if @xmath88 . in any case",
    ", we think a branching ratio of 0.4 is not excluded  @xcite .",
    "we are aware that a smaller branching ratio for @xmath89 implies a larger production cross - section for top , and therefore a smaller mass .",
    "this situation is interesting , and we are not quite sure about its implications .",
    "we note that if stop decays to @xmath87 then the @xmath90 final state will often have @xmath91 + @xmath92 so it will have extra @xmath93 events .",
    "a mild indication of such an effect has been reported  @xcite .",
    "d0 has reported  @xcite some limits on light stops .",
    "it is difficult to show the impact of this on figure 1 without model dependence since one has to relate charginos and neutralinos . for stops above about 60 gev it constrains possible solutions , but has little impact below that .",
    "this could be interpreted as an argument for lighter stops , but is not conclusive .",
    "in susy the value of the lightest higgs boson mass can be calculated , but it depends on other parameters .",
    "there is an upper limit , independent of models , of about @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "the mssm gives upper limits of about @xmath95 . in all cases",
    "@xmath3 has a tree level value plus a large contribution mainly from top dependent one  loop corrections .",
    "the tree level limit is @xmath96 , so for @xmath1 near 1 this is very small , and the upper limit on @xmath3 is considerable reduced . in the minimal model",
    "it is then well below 100 gev .",
    "the loop contributions are also reduced when the stop mass is small .",
    "therefore it is nearly certain that lep will find @xmath60 ( if @xmath33 is real and explained by susy ) if a total energy over 190 gev and @xmath97 are obtained . with @xmath1 near 1 the light higgs is rather standard - model - like , but even if the @xmath98 cross - section were suppressed the @xmath99 cross - section should be large enough .",
    "there are at least three major consequences of these arguments for the form a supersymmetric unified theory can take .",
    "two of them have been remarked on before  @xcite and we only briefly comment on them here .",
    "each of the three excludes the mssm .",
    "it is exciting that data at the electroweak scale may be constraining the theory at the unification scale  if it is , once we have information on superpartner properties it may be possible to determine much of the effective lagrangian at the unification scale from experiments at the electroweak scale .",
    "it is well known that in order to have light superpartners in the mssm it is necessary to have @xmath100  @xcite , while we see here that @xmath5 is about .112 .",
    "thus the theory must have some additional structure in order to lower @xmath5 .",
    "second , the stop and chargino mass matrices and couplings must be such that the chargino is largely higgsino and the stop mainly right - handed , in order that the @xmath101 vertex ( which is proportional to @xmath15 ) enter at full strength while the chargino and stop are light , and other constraints are met . that can not happen in the mssm when one looks carefully at the conditions  @xcite .",
    "third , we have seen here that we require a value of @xmath1 about 1.1 . that is lower than the perturbative lower limit given approximately by @xmath102 .",
    "one could view that as evidence against a susy explanation of @xmath33 , but we think that is premature , because the form of a more complete supersymmetric theory can affect the running of the top yukawa , thus lowering the allowed @xmath1 .",
    "we prefer to view it as a constraint on the form of a satisfactory unified supersymmetric theory , a constraint that the mssm fails .",
