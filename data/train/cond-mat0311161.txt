    "i.e. _ , the average valence of the co ions in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane is + 4 ) , as @xmath137 increased from 0 , the system is paramagnetic metal up to @xmath140 , and changes into a metal with a spiral ic - sdw , and then at @xmath141 , a first - order metal - insulator transition occurs @xcite .",
    "also the calculations predict that @xcite , as @xmath52 increases from 0 , the magnitude of @xmath142 at the boundary between the paramagnetic and sdw phases decreases with increasing slope ( @xmath143 ) up to @xmath52=0.75 . even for @xmath142=0 ,",
    "the sdw phase is stable at @xmath52=0.75 .",
    "@xmath142 increases with further increasing @xmath52 , with decreasing slope .",
    "in other words , at @xmath52=0.75 ( _ i.e. _ the average valence of the co ions in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane is + 3.5 ) , a spiral ic - sdw state is expected to appear at the highest temperature in the @xmath52 range between 0.5 and 1 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is estimated as 0.74 for [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] and 0.715 , 0.70 , 0.73 and 0.73 for pure , sr- , y- , and bi - doped [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] respectively , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tep ] ) and @xmath18(300  k ) . therefore ,",
    "the fact that @xmath88 for [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] is higher than those for pure and doped [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] ( see figure  [ fig : sdw_others ] ) is roughly explained by the model calculations , if we ignore the data for sr - doped [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "also , it should be pointed out that the increased two - dimensionality induced by the increase in the interlayer distance between coo@xmath0 planes plays a significant role to increase @xmath88 .",
    "this is because @xmath88 for [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] is considerably higher than those for pure and doped [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "here , we repeat the prediction of the model calculations .",
    "that is , the sdw phase is stable at @xmath52=0.75 even for @xmath142=0 ; this means that , on the ideal two - dimensional triangular lattice at @xmath52=0.75 , the sdw spin structure appears at temperatures below its melting point .",
    "indeed , the large observed transition width ( 60  k ) are consistent with enhanced two - dimensionality and resulting spin fluctuations .",
    "therefore , not only the shift of @xmath52 towards the optimal value ( 0.75 ) but also the enhanced two - dimensionality are considered to increase @xmath88 for [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "since the magnitude of @xmath86 indicates the amplitude of the ic - sdw directly , there are two predominant factors for @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the magnitude and direction of the co spin in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane .",
    "the former is a constant at low temperatures , because the spin configurations for co@xmath123 and co@xmath117 ions ( * s*=0 and 1/2 ) are not affected by both dopant and the number of layers in the rocksalt - type subsystem .",
    "the latter is a function of magnetic anisotropy in the lattice . here",
    "the magnetic anisotropy in [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] is most likely to be equivalent to that in [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] due to similar environment around the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane in the two cobaltites .",
    "that is , the first and second nearest adjacent plane for the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane are the ca - o and ( co@xmath2cu@xmath144)-o or co - o plane in the rocksalt - type subsystem , although the third nearest plane is different for the two cobaltites .",
    "therefore , @xmath86(0  k ) is considered to be approximately same for all the cobaltites investigated here ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw_others ] ) .",
    "the @xmath91 curve exhibits a clear anomaly at @xmath24 85  k , while the results of both wtf-@xmath7sr and zf-@xmath7sr do not ( see figures  [ fig : wtf - musr ] , [ fig : sdw1&2 ] and [ fig : sdw1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no marked anomaly at 140 - 200  k in the @xmath91 curve ( see figure  [ fig : chi ] ) , although @xmath7sr detects the formation of the ic - sdw state .",
    "this is quite similar to the case for [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] ; where according to the @xmath7sr experiments , it was found that the short - range ic - sdw order appeared below @xmath24 100  k and the long - range order completed below 27  k , whereas the @xmath91 curve below 300  k only exhibited a ferrimagnetic transition at 19  k @xcite .",
    "the structures of the ic - sdw of both compounds are considered to be essentially the same , as discussed above . for [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] ,",
    "the ic - sdw is induced by ordering of the co moments in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane , whereas the ferrimagnetic ordering arises because of the interlayer coupling between the co spins in the [ coo@xmath0 ] and [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13 subsystems@xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : sdw1](b ) , the microscopic internal ic - sdw field does not change around 85  k. furthermore , the extremely small value of the asymmetry of the exponential relaxation function @xmath75 , even at 2.1  k , ( see figure  [ fig : sdw1](a ) ) suggests that the anomaly at @xmath24 85  k is not a transition to a spin - glass state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the anomaly at @xmath24 85  k is most likely caused by some order between the two subsystems , _",
    "i.e. _ , the [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 and the [ coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "the interlayer coupling between both subsystems is expected to be basically antiferromagnetic ( af ) , because there was no clear @xmath145 loop even at 5  k. in other words , a two - dimensional af ( ic - sdw ) order of the co spins completes at 140  k , whereas a three - dimensional af order occurs below @xmath24 85  k.    the [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 subsystem consists of two ca - o planes and two ( co@xmath2cu@xmath144)-o planes ; so that , the two ( co@xmath2cu@xmath144)-o planes are sandwiched by the two ca - o planes . considering the fact that 1/3 of the co ions are replaced by cu ions and that the thickness of the rocksalt - type subsystem increases due to the extra ( co@xmath2cu@xmath144)-o plane , the coupling along the @xmath12-axis for [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] is rather weak compared with that for [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "this weak coupling is likely to be a significant factor for the thermal hysteresis of the @xmath91 curve .",
    "that is , the ic - sdw in each [ coo@xmath0 ] plane is considered to be moved by the external magnetic field ( @xmath24 10  koe ) at 85 - 140  k , but fixed below @xmath24 85  k.",
    "in order to elucidate the magnetism in good thermoelectric layered cobaltites , @xmath7sr spectroscopy has been used on a @xmath12-aligned polycrystalline [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] sample at temperatures below 300  k. it was found that [ ca@xmath0co@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] exhibits a transition at around 140  k from a paramagnetic to an incommensurate spin density wave ic - sdw state , although a short - range order appears below @xmath24 180  k.    by comparison with the @xmath7sr results on pure and doped [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath13@xmath14[coo@xmath0 ] , the ic - sdw appears to be common behavior for these cobaltites .",
    "the characteristic features of the ic - sdw are as follows ;    1 .",
    "a long - range ic - sdw order completes below @xmath88 , while a short - range order is observed at 40 - 60  k higher than @xmath88 with a transition width @xmath146 = 40 - 60  k. 2 .",
    "the ic - sdw propagates in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane , with oscillating moments directed along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the ic - sdw exists not in the rocksalt - type subsystem but in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath130 is found to be sensitive both to the co valence in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , the occupancy of the co spin ( @xmath18=1/2 ) in the triangular lattice , and to the structure of the subsystem sandwiched by the two [ coo@xmath0 ] planes .",
    "therefore , physical properties of the layered cobaltites should be investigated systematically as functions of the co valence in the [ coo@xmath0 ] plane and the distance between the two adjacent [ coo@xmath0 ] planes .",
