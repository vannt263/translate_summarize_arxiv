    "inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) is believed to be one of the promising energy sources in the 21@xmath0 century .",
    "the aim of icf is to compress a plasma target to densities and temperatures high enough to trigger a thermonuclear reaction . despite a great technical development and progress in power supplies during the last decades @xcite ,",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities remain the limiting factor in fusion performance and efficiency . in this respect ,",
    "the most difficult obstacle in achieving icf is the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , which arises because of target acceleration @xcite .",
    "still , the rt instability is not the only instability of importance in icf ; for example , the laser generated plasma is also subject to the so called darrieus - landau ( dl ) instability @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the dl instability is known as the hydrodynamic instability of a slow flame @xcite , which makes the flame front corrugated and increases the burning rate .",
    "flame is the most typical example of a deflagration wave , which is a front propagating due to energy release and thermal conduction .",
    "the ablation flow generated by laser radiation on a plasma target is also a deflagration wave @xcite .",
    "other interesting examples of deflagration come from astrophysical applications like the big bang model and type i supernovae @xcite . on the basis of similar physical properties of deflagrations",
    ", one should expect the dl instability to develop in laser ablation .",
    "there has been much interest in the dl instability in ablation flows , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "however , the most important features of the instability has remained unclear up until now .",
    "the purpose of the present theoretical work is to answer some of the key questions concerning the dl instability in laser ablation and to indicate conditions for experimental observation of the instability .",
    "the classical theory of the dl instability considers an incompressible flow generated by a slow flame @xcite .",
    "however , the parameters of laser ablation flows in icf are markedly different from those of slow combustion .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of deflagration in icf is that the plasma velocity reaches the isothermal sound speed at the critical surface of laser light absorption .",
    "for this reason , laser ablation corresponds to the so - called chapman - jouguet ( cj ) deflagration , which is the fastest propagation regime possible for a deflagration front .",
    "thus , in order to describe the dl instability in laser ablation one has to take into account strong compression of the plasma flow with relatively high local values of the mach number .",
    "another important property inherent to the plasma flow is the strong temperature dependence of electron thermal conduction .",
    "electron thermal conduction determines the total thickness and the internal structure of laser deflagration .",
    "it is expected that the strong plasma compression and the electron thermal conduction properties will significantly influence the properties of the dl instability in a laser generated plasma , making it markedly different from the case of slow flames .",
    "a number of papers was devoted to the linear and nonlinear stages of the dl instability in icf @xcite .",
    "still , these papers did not answer the most important questions concerning the dl instability in laser ablation .",
    "in particular , we would here like to outline the following three questions within the problem :    1 .",
    "how strong is the dl instability in laser ablation in comparison to the classical case , i.e. , is it stronger or weaker than the dl instability developing at a slow flame front ? 2 .   what is the characteristic length scale of the instability development",
    "this question is especially important from the experimental point of view , since the answer determines the target size , for which the dl instability may be observed .",
    "3 .   what is the outcome of the dl instability at the nonlinear stage ?",
    "there have been numerous attempts to answer the first question within the model of a discontinuous deflagration front in a compressible gas / plasma flow @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the discontinuous model encounters the deficit of matching conditions at the deflagration front ; the number of unknown variables exceeds the number of conservation laws at the front by one .",
    "the problem was encountered first within the studies of the rt instability in laser ablation , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; more detailed discussion on this subject may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the classical incompressible limit of the dl instability at a slow flame front",
    ", the extra condition is given by the so - called dl condition of a constant deflagration speed with respect to the cold gas .",
    "this condition may be proven rigorously , see ref .",
    "a counterpart of the dl condition for a compressible flow is not obvious and the solution to the problem turned out to be sensitive to this assumed extra condition , so that the different analytical theories proposed led to qualitatively different results .",
    "for this reason , it was unclear if strong plasma compression in laser ablation made the dl instability stronger , or weaker , or only produces minor changes in the instability strength .",
    "within this context , refs .",
    "@xcite deserve special attention , since these papers considered influence of gas compression on the dl instability taking into account a continuous structure of the deflagration front .",
    "though refs .",
    "@xcite were devoted to normal combustion , and the respective results can not be extrapolated directly to the dl instability in laser ablation , the method used in these papers may still be used for the ablation studies .",
    "this method eliminates the deficit of boundary conditions and allows for investigating the properties of the dl instability in laser ablation .",
    "here we employ the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite to study the linear stage of the dl instability in a laser plasma , thus answering questions 1 and 2 of those outlined above .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate main characteristics of the linear dl instability in the laser ablation flow .",
    "we find the dispersion relation of the instability numerically as a solution to an eigenvalue stability problem taking into account the continuous structure of the flow .",
    "we compare the results to the classical dl instability of a usual slow flame .",
    "we show that difference between the two cases is due to two specific features of laser ablation : a high plasma compression and a strong temperature dependence of the electron thermal conduction .",
    "we further demonstrate that the dl instability in laser ablation is much stronger than in the classical case .",
    "in particular , the maximal growth rate of perturbations in laser ablation is about three times larger than for slow flames .",
    "the characteristic length scale of the dl instability in the ablation flow is comparable to the total distance from the ablation zone to the critical zone of laser light absorption .",
    "we discuss the possibility of experimental observations of the dl instability in laser ablation .",
    "we describe the ablation plasma flow using hydrodynamic equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation @xmath1    @xmath2    @xmath3 } = \\omega _ { r } , \\ ] ]    and the equation of state of an ideal gas    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the adiabatic exponent , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the heat capacities at constant pressure and volume respectively .",
    "electron thermal conduction @xmath8 depends on temperature as @xmath9 , where label `` c '' refers to the critical surface of laser light absorption .",
    "laser light absorption brings energy into the plasma and , together with thermal conduction , it drives the flow .",
    "absorption takes place when plasma frequency is equal to the laser frequency    @xmath10    which determines plasma density @xmath11 at the critical surface ( here @xmath12 is plasma mass per one electron ) .",
    "decrease of the laser light intensity due to absorption may be described as @xcite    @xmath13    with the absorption coefficient    @xmath14    the absorption coefficient diverges at the critical surface , and , therefore , the process of energy absorption is strongly localized at the surface . in the studies of ablation flow and the rt and dl instabilities in the flow ,",
    "the energy release is typically presented by @xmath15-function @xcite .",
    "such replacement is possible since the instabilities develop on the length scales much larger than the region of energy release and involve bending of this region as a whole without changing its internal structure . in the present paper",
    "we solve the problem of the dl instability numerically . in the numerical solution , it is more convenient to imitate the @xmath15-function by a transitional zone of finite width determined by some continuous function @xmath16 of energy gain in the flow included into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . here , we chose the function in the form suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite    @xmath17    the function @xmath18 was constructed taken into account similarity with the arrhenius law in combustion , where @xmath19 plays the role of the scaled activation energy and @xmath20 is similar to the reaction order .",
    "it is well - known that the arrhenius law provides strong localization of energy release for any reasonable @xmath20 in the case of sufficiently large @xmath21 , see @xcite . in combustion science",
    "the arrhenius reaction is sensitive to temperature changes @xcite .",
    "here we construct the function of energy gain @xmath22 sensitive to density variations , as it takes place in laser ablation .",
    "choosing large parameter @xmath23 we obtain energy gain strongly localized at the critical surface with @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical solution demands a finite width of the zone of energy release and the finite value of the parameter @xmath19 . in most of our calculations we use @xmath25 ,",
    "we also investigate sensitivity of the physical results to the choice of these parameters .",
    "we demonstrate that these parameters have minor influence upon the properties of the dl instability and at high values of @xmath27 this influence vanishes .",
    "the function @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) allows a planar stationary solution consisting of two uniform flows of cold heavy plasma ( label `` a '' ) and hot light plasma ( label `` c '' ) separated by a transitional region , which is the deflagration front .",
    "the labels `` a '' and `` c '' originate from the ablation and critical surfaces in the laser deflagration .",
    "typical internal structure of the deflagration front is illustrated in fig .",
    "the described geometry is common in the theoretical studies of the rt and dl instabilities of the ablation flow @xcite , though it does not take into account the rarefaction wave in the hot light plasma beyond the critical surface . as the main advantage of such a choice",
    ", we may consider different values of the mach number in the light plasma , which would be impossible with a rarefaction wave .",
    "changing the mach number , we can go over continuously from the case of classical incompressible dl instability of a usual flame front to the case of laser ablation with strong influence of plasma compression .",
    "we stress that the main purpose of the present paper is to compare the dl instability in laser ablation to the classical case .",
    "therefore , in general , we will discuss stability of a deflagration front , which covers the cases of usual flames ( slow combustion ) and laser ablation as two asymptotic limits of negligible compression effects and ultimately strong plasma compression .",
    "we start our analysis with describing internal structure of the stationary planar deflagration ( laser ablation ) flow ; this is the first step in the stability analysis .",
    "figure 1 illustrates plasma density , temperature and energy release in the flow obtained numerically as described below . the deflagration front in fig .",
    "1 propagates to the left with constant velocity @xmath28 ( the ablation velocity ) in the negative direction of z - axis .",
    "velocity of a usual flame is determined by the rate of energy release and thermal conduction .",
    "ablation velocity is determined by the critical density and the laser light intensity @xcite .",
    "we adopt the reference frame of the deflagration front . in that case",
    "the front is at rest , but the cold heavy plasma flows to the right with uniform velocity @xmath29 , undergoes transition in density and temperature in the deflagration wave , and , finally , the hot light plasma gets drifted away with uniform velocity @xmath30 .",
    "equations of mass and momentum transfer ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) may be integrated for the planar stationary deflagration as    @xmath31    @xmath32    one of the main dimensionless parameters in the problem is the expansion factor    @xmath33    which shows density drop from the original cold plasma to the critical surface .",
    "both in flames and laser ablation , the expansion factor is rather large , @xmath34 , see @xcite . in the case of ablation flow",
    ", the laser light frequency determines the critical density and the expansion factor .",
    "the other important parameter is the mach number in the light plasma ( gas ) corresponding to the adiabatic sound    @xmath35    the mach number is negligible in the classical case of usual flames , and it may be taken zero with a very good accuracy .",
    "on the contrary , laser ablation provides an ultimately large value of the mach number possible for a deflagration flow . in laser ablation ,",
    "the isothermal mach number is equal unity @xmath36 in the light plasma , and we have @xmath37 for the adiabatic mach number . in the present work we consider a general case of a deflagration front with an arbitrary mach number changing within the limits @xmath38 .",
    "the internal structure of the deflagration front follows from the stationary equation of energy transfer    @xmath39 } = \\omega _ { r } .\\ ] ]    characteristic width of the front is determined by thermal conduction in the hot region    @xmath40    the problem involves one more parameter of length dimension    @xmath41    related to thermal conduction in the cold flow . because of the strong temperature dependence of electron thermal conduction , these two length scales are quite different @xmath42 .",
    "for example , for the temperatures ratio @xmath43 , the length scales differ by two orders of magnitude @xmath44 .",
    "the strong difference in these length scales is one of the specific features of laser ablation in comparison with usual flames .",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables for plasma density , temperature , velocity and coordinate    @xmath45    then we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) as    @xmath46 } = \\lambda \\left ( { \\varphi - 1 } \\right)^{n}\\exp \\left ( { - \\beta \\varphi } \\right ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is an eigenvalue of the stationary problem .",
    "the relation between temperature and density in a deflagration flow follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] )    @xmath48    in the incompressible limit of usual flames , @xmath49 , this relation is reduced simply to @xmath50 , so that temperature ratio @xmath51 is determined by the expansion ratio , @xmath52 . in the case of strong gas compression , these two values differ considerably .",
    "for example , in the case of laser ablation with the critical mach number @xmath53 , we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) that    @xmath54    for high values of density drop , @xmath55 , temperature ratio is about twice smaller than the expansion factor , @xmath56 . because of the reduced temperature ratio , the effect of two different length scales eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) in the ablation flow is expected to become weaker than in a similar incompressible flow . with temperature ratio changing from @xmath52 in the incompressible case to @xmath56 in the ablation flow we find the ratio of length scales @xmath57 decreasing by the factor of @xmath58 .",
    "for this reason , the profiles of density and temperature are expected to be much smoother in the ablation flow in comparison with an incompressible counterpart .",
    "we solve eq.([eq17 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) numerically for different values of the mach number .",
    "typical solution to the problem for incompressible case is shown in fig .",
    "1 . first of all , we have to make sure , that the ablation front structure is not sensitive to our choice of the energy gain function @xmath18 .",
    "we investigate dependence of the density and temperature profiles on the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "figure 2 shows density and energy release for @xmath59 , @xmath26 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "density profiles for these three values of @xmath19 coincide almost everywhere except for the zone of energy gain . still , even inside this zone , the difference between the density profiles is minimal , and can not be recognized on fig .",
    "2 . similar result holds for the temperature profiles .",
    "thus , we can conclude that parameter @xmath19 does not affect the density and temperature profiles in the ablation front . at the same time ,",
    "parameter @xmath19 influences strongly the profile of energy release itself : the respective plots become much more localized with @xmath19 increasing .",
    "thickness of the critical surface should be zero in the hydrodynamic description of the ablation flow .",
    "therefore , finite width of the zone of energy gain implies certain inaccuracy of the numerical solution .",
    "the level of inaccuracy of the model may be evaluated as the characteristic width of the energy gain zone in the dimensionless variables ( scaled by the total thickness of the deflagration front @xmath62 . as we can see in fig . 2",
    ", half width of the energy peak is rather wide for @xmath63 ; it takes more than 20% of the whole deflagration front .",
    "as we increase @xmath19 , this width becomes smaller and for @xmath64 the inaccuracy is less than 5% .",
    "the other parameter of the energy gain function in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , @xmath20 , affects the shape of the energy release peak only slightly even for moderate values of @xmath19 . for @xmath65",
    "the parameter @xmath20 has a negligible effect on the physical results .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) may imitate the energy gain in the ablation flow quite well ; in all following numerical solutions and figures @xmath66 and @xmath26 .    as the next step",
    ", we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) for different values of the mach number .",
    "figure 3 shows profiles of density and energy release , for @xmath67 , other parameters being fixed as @xmath59 , @xmath65 , @xmath26 ; figure 4 presents the respective temperature profiles . in the case of incompressible flow , @xmath68 , the density profile demonstrates clearly the effect of two length scales , eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) , produced by the temperature - dependent thermal conduction .",
    "the profile is rather smooth in the hot region close to the critical surface , and it becomes sharp in the cold plasma close to the ablation surface with large density gradient .",
    "in fact , it is this property , which allows distinguishing two effective surfaces in the flow : the ablation and critical surfaces @xcite . in the case of strong compression with @xmath69 ,",
    "the density profile becomes much smoother .",
    "smoothing of the density profile concerns the region of cold plasma mainly .",
    "another specific feature of the density profile at high values of the mach number is shown at the insert of fig .",
    "3 . with the mach number approaching the maximal possible value @xmath53",
    ", we observe development of another mini - region of relatively high density gradient close to the critical surface .",
    "this effect may be also obtained analytically from eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) .",

    "@xcite . the destabilization concerns all parameters of the instability : the factor @xmath126 in eq.([eq41 ] ) , the maximal instability growth rate , @xmath150 , and the cut - off wave number , @xmath146 .",
    "these results are presented in figs .",
    "6  8 , respectively .",
    "figure 6 shows the factor @xmath126 , which determines strength of the dl instability in the case of an infinitely thin front .",
    "the solution is obtained for the expansion factors @xmath151 . according to fig .",
    "6 , the dl instability for an infinitely thin ablation front ( with ultimately strong plasma compression ) is almost twice stronger than in the incompressible flow .",
    "the ratio of @xmath126-factors obtained for @xmath152 and @xmath68 is about 1.8 for @xmath153 .",
    "some analytical theories for the dl instability in compressible flows predicted also increase of the growth rate with the mach number @xcite .",
    "still , the numerical results show a noticeably stronger increase than any analytical theory proposed so far . as explained in @xcite , the stability problem of a discontinuous deflagration front",
    "encounters a deficit of matching conditions at the front : the number of unknown values exceeds the number of matching equations by one . in order to overcome the obstacle ,",
    "different additional matching conditions were suggested in different papers @xcite .",
    "solution to the problem turned to be quite sensitive to the choice of the extra condition ; but the extra conditions suggested were merely assumptions .",
    "this trouble does not happen in the numerical solution , since the numerical solution considers continuous transition from heavy cold plasma to light hot one .",
    "for this reason , the numerical solution provides also a test for the suggested analytical solutions . in this work we are not going to criticize the previous analytical theories .",
    "instead , we will try to extract the best ideas suggested so far in the theoretical papers @xcite to obtain the analytical solution reasonably close to the numerical one . for that purpose",
    "we take the basic elements in the analysis @xcite and complement them by an extra matching condition identical to that of the dl theory of the incompressible flow @xcite . in the dimensional variables the dl matching condition is    @xmath154    where @xmath155 is perturbation of the discontinuous front position .",
    "the same type of matching condition was assumed for the dl instability in a compressible deflagration / ablation flow in @xcite . reproducing calculations of @xcite with the extra condition ( [ eq45 ] )",
    "we obtain the following equation for @xmath126    @xmath156    where    @xmath157    and the mach number in the cold plasma    @xmath158    influence of the mach number may be illustrated in the limit of small plasma compression , @xmath159 , using taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq46 ] ) . in that case",
    "@xmath160    where @xmath161 corresponds to dl solution for incompressible case and @xmath27 is determined as    @xmath162    positive factor @xmath27 indicates increase of the instability growth rate with plasma compression .",
    "the numerical solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq46 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq49 ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "6 by the solid and dashed lines respectively .",
    "these lines do not provide a perfect agreement with the numerical results ; still the difference between the theory and the numerical solution is acceptable , about 15% . for comparison ,",
    "6 shows also the instability growth rate predicted in @xcite , by dash - dotted lines .",
    "the theory in @xcite differs much stronger from the numerical solution , approximately by 35% .",
    "figure 7 shows the maximal instability growth rate versus the mach number for the expansion factors @xmath151 .",
    "as we can see , in the case of laser ablation with @xmath163 the maximal instability growth rate is about three times larger than in the incompressible case .",
    "these results agree well with the previous numerical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite for flames in a compressible flow .",
    "it is interesting that the maximal growth rate shows only minor dependence on the mach number for a rather wide range of this parameter , @xmath164 .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath165 on @xmath166 takes place only when the mach number starts approaching the limiting value @xmath167 inherent to laser ablation .",
    "we observe a similar tendency in fig .",
    "8 , which presents the cut - off wave number versus the mach number .",
    "again , the cut - off wave number is about twice larger for laser ablation in comparison with the incompressible case of zero mach number .",
    "figure 9 compares the cut - off wavelength found numerically for different values of the mach number to the theoretical prediction eq .",
    "( [ eq44 ] ) .",
    "we remind that eq .",
    "( [ eq44 ] ) follows from the theory @xcite in the limit of an incompressible flow and thermal conduction depending on temperature as @xmath137 .",
    "as we can see , the theory ( [ eq44 ] ) provides a reasonable prediction for the cut - off wavelength in the case of zero mach number ; the difference between the theory and the numerical solution is about ( 15 - 25)% .",
    "as we increase the mach number , the dl instability becomes stronger and the cut - off wavelength decreases considerably .",
    "for example , taking the expansion ratio @xmath168 we find the cut - off wavelength @xmath169 for laser ablation , @xmath170 for the incompressible case of @xmath171 and @xmath172 predicted by the analytical formula ( [ eq44 ] ) .",
    "thus , the numerical solution predicts the dl instability in laser ablation on the length scales larger by the factor of 2.4 than the distance from the ablation zone to the critical zone .",
    "these length scales are very small when compared to the respective ratio @xmath173 for usual flames .",
    "however , these length scales are extremely large in comparison with the length scales typical for the rt instability in inertial confined fusion @xcite . for this reason , in order to observe the dl instability experimentally one has to take special precautions eliminating the rt instability in the flow",
    ". one of the possible options is to use a sufficiently large target of the thickness exceeding the distance @xmath174 at least by an order of magnitude . in that case",
    "target acceleration is minor , which leads to the negligible rt instability , while the dl instability has sufficient space to develop .",
    "in addition , one has to remember that experimental observations typically concern the fastest growing perturbations of the wavelength @xmath143 and larger , not the cut - off wavelength @xmath146 . in the case of usual flames these two length scales are related as @xmath175 , since the whole dispersion relation may be described with a good accuracy by two first terms in taylor expansion in @xmath176 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq43 ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath177 becomes somewhat different for the dl instability in laser ablation .",
    "figure 10 shows the ratio @xmath177 obtained numerically for different values of the mach number , and compares it to the classical case of @xmath178 .",
    "we can see that the wavelength corresponding to the maximal instability growth rate is about @xmath179 in laser ablation .",
    "the deviation indicates that next order terms become important in the taylor expansion of the instability growth rate in @xmath176 .",
    "still , the deviation is not too large .",
    "finally , we have to check that our model for the energy gain in the deflagration / laser ablation flow does not influence the physical results obtained . in order to validate the model we investigated influence of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the energy gain on the dl dispersion relation .",
    "numerical calculations for @xmath65 and different values of @xmath20 show negligible variations of all parameters of the instability : the @xmath126-factor , the maximal instability growth rate and the cut - off wavelength .",
    "we also took @xmath180 and varied @xmath19 within the limits between 20 and 140 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath181 we find the maximal growth rate @xmath182 for @xmath63 , @xmath183 for @xmath65 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "these calculations indicate that the continuous numerical model for the energy gain function @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) brings inaccuracy of only few per cent , about 3% , into the numerical solution for @xmath65 used in the present paper .",

    "in the present paper we investigated the dl instability in an ablation flow and compared the results to the classical case of a slow flame . unlike the normal flame , laser ablation is characterized by the strongest plasma compression possible for a deflagration wave .",
