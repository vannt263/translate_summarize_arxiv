    "reinsurance has been long investigated as an intrinsic part of commercial insurance , of which the mainstream modeling framework is profit maximization with the one - sided impulse control of an underlying reserve process .",
    "there are two types of one - sided impulse control : downside - only impulse control ( such as a dividend payment ) with a fixed cost @xmath8(e.g .",
    ", cadenillas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , hojgaard and taksar @xcite ) and upside - only impulse control ( such as inventory ordering ) with a fixed cost @xmath9 ( e.g. , bensoussan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , eisenberg and schmidli @xcite , sulem @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we examine mutual proportional reinsurance  a mutual reserve system that is intended for the collective reinsurance needs of homogeneous mutual members , such as the p&i clubs in marine mutual insurance ( e.g. , yuan @xcite ) and the reserve banks in the u.s . federal reserve ( e.g. , dawande _",
    "a mutual insurance differs from a general ( non - mutual ) insurance in two key dimensions : 1 ) a mutual system is not for profit and 2 ) a mutual reserve involves two - sided impulse control ( i.e. , both a dividend refund as a downside impulse to decrease the reserve with cost @xmath8 and a call for funds as an upside impulse to increase the reserve with cost @xmath9 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the reserve process for a general insurance must always be positive ( above zero ) , and the insurance firm is considered bankrupt as soon as its reserve falls to zero .",
    "the mutual proportional reinsurance model developed in this paper is a generalization of the proportional reinsurance models ( e.g. , cadenillas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , hojgaard and taksar @xcite , eisenberg and schmidli @xcite ) and is modified with the two differing characteristics noted above . more specifically , the proportional reinsurance rate can be adjusted in continuous time , and the underlying mutual reserve process is regulated by a two - sided impulse control in terms of a contingent dividend payment ( i.e. , a downside impulse control to decrease the mutual reserve level ) and contingent call for contributions ( i.e. , an upside impulse control to increase the mutual reserve level ) . the corresponding mathematical problem for mutual proportional reinsurance becomes a two - sided impulse control system combined with a classical rate control in continuous time , a problem yet to be posed in insurance research .",
    "a problem that involves a mix of impulse control and classical control is termed a hybrid control problem in control theory , of which the diculty has been well noted ( e.g. , bensoussan _ _ and menaldi @xcite , branicky and mitter @xcite , abate _",
    "@xcite ) .    a pure two - sided impulse control problem ( i.e. , without a classical rate control ) was investigated by constantinides @xcite in the form of cash management .",
    "constantinides and richard @xcite showed an optimal two - sided impulse control policy to exist in the form of a band control , denoted with four parameters as @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , when the reserve position reaches a lower boundary @xmath12 , then the reserve should immediately be raised to level @xmath3 ; when the reserve reaches upper boundary @xmath4 , it should immediately be reduced to level @xmath5 . for our mutual proportional reinsurance problem ,",
    "we specify the corresponding hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation and the associated quasi - variational inequalities ( qvi ) , from which we analytically solve the optimal value function .",
    "we then prove that a special band - type impulse control @xmath13 with @xmath1 , combined with a proportional reinsurance policy ( classical control ) , is optimal when the objective is to minimize the total maintenance cost .",
    "an interesting finding reported here is that there exists a situation such that if the upside fixed cost @xmath9 is relatively large in comparison to a finite threshold @xmath14 , then the optimal band control is reduced to a downside only ( i.e. , a dividend payment only ) control in the form of @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in this case , it is optimal for the mutual insurance to go bankrupt as soon as its reserve level falls to zero , rather than to restart by calling for additional contingent funds .",
    "this finding partially explains why many mutual insurance companies , that were once quite popular in the financial markets , are either disappeared or converted to non - mutual ones .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the mathematical model and specify the hjb equation and the qvi of the corresponding stochastic control problem .",
    "we solve the qvi for the optimal value function in section 3 .",
    "in section 3.2 , we characterize and analyze the threshold @xmath14 . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove the verification theorem and verify the optimal control .",
    "finally , we make concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "the classical cramer - lundberg model of an insurance reserve ( surplus ) is described via a compound poisson process : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the amount of the surplus available at time @xmath17 , quantity @xmath18 represents the premium rate , @xmath19 is the poisson process of incoming claims and @xmath20 is the size of the @xmath21th claim .",
    "this surplus process can be approximated by a diffusion process with drift @xmath22 $ ] and diffusion coefficient @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the intensity of the poisson process @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the insurer always sets @xmath25 $ ] ( i.e. @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , with no control , the reserve process @xmath27 is described by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "we start with a probability space @xmath30 , that is endowed with _",
    "information filtration _ @xmath31 and a standard brownian motion @xmath29 on @xmath32 adapted to @xmath31 .",
    "two types of controls are used in this model .",
    "the first is related to the ability to directly control its reserve by raising cash from or making refunds to members at any particular time .",
    "the second is related to the mutual insurance firm s ability to delegate all or part of its risk to a reinsurance company , simultaneously reducing the incoming premium ( all or part of which is in this case channeled to the reinsurance company ) . in this model",
    ", we consider a _ proportional reinsurance _ scheme .",
    "this type of scheme corresponds to the original insurer paying @xmath33 fraction of the original claim .",
    "the premium rate coming to the original insurer is simultaneously reduced by the same fraction .",
    "the reinsurance rate can can be chosen dynamically depending on the situation .",
    "mathematically , control @xmath34 takes a triple form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a predictable process with respect to @xmath37 , the random variables @xmath38 constitute an increasing sequence of stopping times with respect to @xmath37 , and @xmath39 is a sequence of @xmath40-measurable random variables , @xmath41 .",
    "the meaning of these controls is as follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 represents the fraction of the claim that the mutual insurance scheme pays if the claim arrives at time @xmath17 .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 is chosen at time @xmath17 .",
    "then , in the diffusion approximation ( [ dynamics ] ) , drift @xmath44 and diffusion coefficient @xmath45 are reduced by factor @xmath33 ( see cadenillas _ et at . _",
    "@xcite , hojgaard and taksar @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the process @xmath42 is adapted to information filtration means that any decision has to be made on the basis of past rather than the future information .",
    "the stopping times @xmath46 represent the times when the @xmath21th intervention to change the reserve level is made .",
    "if @xmath47 , then the decision is to raise cash by calling the members / clients .",
    "if @xmath48 , then the decision is to make a refund .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 is a stopping time and @xmath39 is @xmath40-measurable also indicates that the decisions concerning when to make a contingent call and how much cash to raise are made on the basis of only past information .",
    "the same applies to the refund decisions .",
    "once control @xmath34 is chosen , the dynamics of the reserve process becomes : @xmath49 define the ruin time as @xmath50 control @xmath34 is called admissible for initial position @xmath51 if , for @xmath52 for any @xmath53 , @xmath54 and if @xmath55 we denote the set of all admissible controls by @xmath56 .",
    "the meaning of admissibility is as follows . at any time",
    "the decision to make a refund is made , the refund amount can not exceed the available reserve . as can be seen in the following ,",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , then one can always achieve a cost equal to @xmath57 , simply by making an infinitely large refund .",
    "the second condition of admissibility is a rather natural technical condition of integrability .",
    "the objective in this model is to minimize the operational cost and the lost opportunity to invest the money in the market .",
    "cost function @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the positive and negative components of @xmath62 , that is , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the costs associated with refunds are of a different nature .",
    "a contingent call always increases the total cost , whereas a refund decreases it .",
    "however fixed set - up costs @xmath65 and @xmath66 are incurred regardless of of the size of a contingent call or a refund . in addition , when the call is made and the cash is raised , there is a proportional cost associated with the amount raised .",
    "the constant @xmath67 represents the amount of cash that needs to be raised in order for one dollar to be added to the reserve .",
    "if the reserve is used for a refund , then a part of it may be charged as tax .",
    "the constant @xmath68 represents the amount actually received by the shareholders for each dollar taken from the reserve .",
    "given a discount rate @xmath69 , the cost functional associated with the control @xmath34 is defined as @xmath70 the objective is to find the value function , @xmath71 and _ optimal control _",

    "in this model , the application of the control that is related to calls and refunds results in a jump in the reserve process . this type of model is considered in the framework of the so - called__impulse control__. because we also have a control whose application changes the drift and the diffusion coefficient of the controlled process , the resulting mathematical problem becomes a mixed regular - impulse control problem ( e.g. , cadenillas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of a pure impulse control ,",
    "the optimal policy is of the @xmath0 type , where the four parameters used to construct the optimal control must be computed as a part of a solution to the problem ( see cadenillas and zapatero @xcite , constantinides and richard @xcite , harrison and taylor @xcite , and paulsen @xcite ) . parameters @xmath12 and @xmath4 represent the levels at which the intervention ( application of impulses ) must be made , whereas @xmath3 and @xmath5 stand for the positions that the controlled process must be in after the intervention is made .",
    "this is a so - called _ band - type _ policy , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 understood as the two bands that determine the nature of the optimal control .",
