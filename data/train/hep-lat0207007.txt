    "suppose the edge does not have a bond we add a bond on the edge with the probability of the step ( 3 ) and thus @xmath213 if the bond is added .",

    "it is thus numerically not difficult to identify @xmath214 in the case of @xmath213 .",

    "then we remove the bond with the probability of the step ( 3 ) and thus @xmath212 if it is removed .",
    "we may pick up cluster configurations ( b ) and ( d ) of fig.[fig:4.37 ] as particular examples which already has a bond at the edge a - b and c - d , respectively , and turn into ( a ) and ( c ) of fig.[fig:4.37 ] , respectively , after the bond a - b and c - d are removed . in order to find @xmath214 we need to know the information if the both vertices of the edge belong to the same cluster or not after the bond is removed .",
    "the vertices a and b belong to the different cluster in ( a ) and thus @xmath218 , while the vertices c and d belong to the same cluster in ( c ) and thus @xmath217 .",
    "the crucial difference from the case @xmath213 to the case @xmath212 is that the collection of the data set to classify the different cluster is not enough to differentiate if two vertices are in the same cluster or not after the bond is removed .",

    "this method is adequate if the clusters are small enough ( tens of vertices ) , but if large clusters are involved ( in the vicinity of the critical point ) the cpu time requirements can grow unreasonable . since the connectedness , a non - local property ,",

    "the boundaries between clusters on @xmath140 and their dual clusters on @xmath195 will form a collection of closed loops .",
    "now we call this closed loops the surrounding loops .",
    "we then have the euler relation , @xmath220 which relates the number of clusters and bonds to the number of surrounding loops @xmath131 .    by saving information of the surrounding loops as a data set , we transform the problem of determining connectedness of two vertices to the problem of determining whether two surrounding loop segments are part of the same surrounding loop or not .",
    "the surrounding loops are represented as a chain of pointers in the computer .",
    "a pointer is a memory location containing the address of the next pointer in the chain .",
    "there are three surrounding pointers represented by arrows for each vertex , as is shown in fig.[fig:4.35 ] .",

    "because of the ( differential ) euler relation , @xmath224 , we can determine @xmath214 if we can determine @xmath225 , the change in the number of surrounding loops .",

    ", two cuts must be made in chains of pointers and the four ends rejoined if the bond is removed . in the case of a - b",

    "similarly in the case of the bond c - d in fig.[fig:4.37]-(d ) , the @xmath235 and the @xmath236 connections must be replaced by @xmath237 and @xmath238 connections , respectively , in fig.[fig:4.37]-(c ) . by collecting the information of chains",
    "we can immediately conclude that @xmath239 since @xmath221 and @xmath240 are in the same chain for fig.[fig:4.37]-(b ) while @xmath241 and @xmath242 are in the different chains for fig.[fig:4.37]-(d ) and thus @xmath243 .",
    "it is important to note that the imformation of the connectedness of the cluster configuration of ( a ) and ( c ) can be obtained by the data set of the chains of pointers of ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "it is numerically much easier to find if two pointers are in the same loop chain or not .    in summary , in order to find @xmath244 for the metropolis algorithm of the generalized potts model in monte carlo simulation , we first pick up an edge and find out @xmath211 depending on whether the edge has a bond or not .",
    "we first cut and rejoin our chains of pointers depending on addition or removal of the bond on the edge .",
    "using the ( differential ) euler relation , @xmath224 , we evaluate @xmath214 by judging whether two pointers attached to the different vertices of the given edge belong to the same chain or not .",
    "when we apply monte carlo simulations to quantum gravity coupled to the generalized potts model or equivalently the weighted percolation clusters , we have to update the cluster configuration for a given triangulation and at the same time we have to update the triangulation for a given cluster configuration .",

    "we avoid to generate configurations corresponding to tadpole and self - energy graphs . in other words",
    "we consider the class of triangulations satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "no link has coinciding end .",
    "two sites may be connected by no more than one link ( i.e. parallel links are forbidden ) .    in the updating of triangulations ,",
    "if a triangulation in a forbidden class is generated we ignore the attempt to make the flip and instead choose a new link randomly and attempt a new flip .",
    "it is important to recognize that the flip procedure to generate random surface changes the cluster configuration . by the flip procedure the chosen edge which is the dual of the common link of the chosen neighboring triangles changes into a new edge which may or may not have a bond . in the present algorithm",
    "we generate a bond on the new edge with 50% probability .",
    "for example a cluster configuration in fig.[fig:4.34 ] changes into two possible cluster configurations with an equal probability by the flip procedure . in this way",
    "a change in connectivity of two triangles concerned with updating entails a change in the assignments of neighbors and therefore a change in the weight function @xmath245\\ , = \\ ,",
    "q^{c^{(k ) } } v^{b^{(k)}}/z_n^q ( k;{\\cal g}_n)$ ] and then the transition function , @xmath246 , can be estimated according to the metropolis scheme described in the above .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of generalized potts models on dynamically triangulated surfaces are performed using the algorithm mentioned in the previous section . in our simulations",
    "we only generate planar @xmath138-graphs of spherical topology with no tadpole or self - energy configurations .",

    "we first define one sweep of our monte carlo simulation . in the process of updating for a given cluster configuration with a fixed triangulation",
    "one cluster - sweep means checking of the metropolis procedure on each edge of the graph in a given order . on the other hand , in the process of updating dynamical triangulation",
    ", one triangulation - sweep means that we randomly pick up edges one after another with roughly @xmath158 ( total number of edges ) times and try to flip them and at the same time we check to eliminate every triangulations containing tadpole or self - energy graph .    after generating an initial cluster configuration , we thermalize our system by performing 2000 triangulation - sweeps and 1000 cluster - sweeps respectively . for the observables to be measured ,",
    "this thermalization time is enough to thermalize our system according to the measurement of the autocorrelation time at criticality . to obtain a typical cluster sample configuration on a typical random surface background",
    "we perform 100 triangulation - sweeps and 20 cluster - sweeps .",
    "then we measure several observables for the given configuration .",
    "we iterate these operations enough times until independent samples of a given number , which depends on the lattice size and on the observable to be measured , are obtained .",
    "it is a well accepted observation that lattice models with a second order phase transition lead to corresponding continuum theories at the second order phase transition point . in particular minimal conformal lattice models",
    "lead to the corresponding continuum conformal field theory models at the critical point in two dimensions .",
