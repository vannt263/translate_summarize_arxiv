    "the continuing progress in the field of trapped atomic quantum gases  @xcite has led to the development of a variety of experimental techniques ( e.g. , _ in situ _",
    "imaging  @xcite ) to investigate mott insulating phases in trapped bosonic or fermionic atoms  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the physics of strongly - correlated systems , a further step in the agenda will be the investigation of spin - ordered phases , given the recent improvements on cooling methods and ultra  low - temperature measurements .",
    "an important ingredient of the latter advance is the nature and shape of the atomic density profile within the trap , leading to a free gas at the wings of the distribution  @xcite .",
    "as the accuracy of these measurements improves , a detailed description of the possible crossovers involved will be needed in order to analyze the experimental data . indeed , for an atomic sample of finite size",
    ", @xmath4 , the presence of a trap brings about another length scale , @xmath3 ( to be defined more precisely below ) , characterizing the trap shape and size .",
    "therefore , the competition between these ( geometric ) lengths and the one describing the decay of correlations , @xmath10 , which is assumed to diverge at the ordering phase transition in the thermodynamic limit , must be incorporated in a new scaling theory , which generalizes the standard finite - size scaling ( fss )  @xcite .",
    "we should mention that a _ trap - size _ scaling regime , in which both @xmath10 and @xmath3 are large , has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the relevant parameters adjusted in such a way that @xmath11 , thus eliminating most finite sample - size effects .",
    "our purpose here is to develop such generalized scaling theory , and we also adopt the strategy of leaving aside all quantum effects  @xcite and concentrating instead on classical spins localized on sites of a lattice , subject to a trapping field . more specifically , we consider ising - like spins under a spatially varying magnetic field , whose intensity increases with distance @xmath0 to the origin ( trap center )  @xcite . this way , for suitably large @xmath0 the spins are pinned parallel to the local field . with the well - known mapping of the ( pseudo)-spin variable onto a lattice - gas picture , one thus gets at least the main qualitative features of trapping phenomena .",
    "we investigate the scaling behavior of two - dimensional ising spins close to the critical temperature @xmath12 at which , in zero field and in the thermodynamic limit , the correlation length @xmath10 becomes much larger than the lattice parameter , @xmath13 ( to be taken as unity in what follows ) .",
    "initially , only spin@xmath14 systems are considered .",
    "upon addition of a trapping magnetic field , as outlined above , @xmath10 is prevented from diverging , thus smearing out the second - order phase transition .",

    "in both regimes we use numerical transfer matrix ( tm ) methods and fss ideas to disentangle the respective trapping and finite - size effects in ising - like systems which are necessarily finite in extent .",
    "the quantities of interest , such as free energies , equilibrium site magnetizations , bond energies , correlation functions and correlation lengths , can be extracted from the leading eigenvalues of the tm , and from their respective eigenvectors  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , in the shallow trap regime , conformal invariance allows us to develop a perturbative theory , whose predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical data .",

    "we use tm methods on long strips of width @xmath4 sites of a square lattice , with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) across .",

    "the relative shortness of such sequences , compared to the @xmath175 case , makes extrapolation somewhat risky . however , by attempting power - law fits @xmath176 , we saw that , by successively excluding an increasing number of smaller strips widths , the sequences of estimates for @xmath177 vary as : @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 ( @xmath4 even ) ; and @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 ( @xmath4 odd ) .",

    "this is analogous to what happens in the two - dimensional @xmath225 model , which has a line of fixed points , and exponents varying along the line  @xcite .",
    "there , the position on the line is related to a relevant variable which is marginal in the sense that it does not remove criticality , although it does affect exponents .",
    "here we have the same scenario ( but without , yet , a flow diagram to support it ) . in the low - field regime (",
    "i.e. , for `` shallow '' traps , @xmath15 ) one expects a linear - response scenario to be appropriate . for ising systems we can therefore use this , together with exact conformal - invariance results , to produce analytical predictions to be compared with numerical results from tm methods , at the critical point of the otherwise infinite and untrapped system .",
    "we have established that , in accordance with our _ ansatz _ , the local magnetization displays the scaling behavior @xmath226 to leading order in @xmath67 , where @xmath96 is the distance from the center along the finite strip direction ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : lowfield ] .    in the high - field regime , @xmath227 , scaling bears the signature of the @xmath6-dependent trap exponent @xmath149 , as previously discussed in ref .",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) ] .",
    "for @xmath19 we have provided independent checks of the exponents for the scaling at criticality of the central magnetization and of the energy density , in very good numerical agreement with ref .  .",
    "furthermore , with our tm calculations over a broad range of values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( spin-1/2 ) , we have established that the scaled correlation lengths behave as @xmath228 , where the function @xmath159 very accurately follows a form predicted by scaling arguments .",
    "controlling for the quality of data collapse provides us with an estimate for the exponent @xmath229 ( for @xmath19 ) which agrees very well with the respective scaling prediction , @xmath193 .",
    "we have also given an analytic treatment which describes how the finite-@xmath6 scaling function evolves , in the @xmath160 limit , towards a piecewise straight - line shape [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_infty ] ) ] .    as a further check of the theory , we have also considered the high - field regime for a spin-1 ising model in two situations .",
    "the first corresponds to an immediate extension of the spin-1/2 case , in which the trapping field couples to the magnetization .",
    "since the tms for @xmath16 are larger than for @xmath175 , we were not able to consider linear lattice sizes as large as previously . thus , the quality of the data collapse and scaling fits was somewhat compromised ; however , our results are broadly consistent with fits to the same exponents as before , namely , @xmath193 and @xmath230 ( in standard notation of critical exponents ) for @xmath19 .",
    "this picture therefore gives support to the universality of trapping exponents against spin magnitude .",
    "we have also examined the blume - capel ( bc ) model , with the trapping field coupling to @xmath231 ( whose average gives the `` particle density '' , in the lattice - gas language ) . this latter feature might be considered a more transparent way to connect the spin language to that of particle trapping .",
    "however , we have seen that the fixed - point structure of the bc phase diagram puts one at a disadvantage , concerning the estimation of scaling exponents for physically plausible values of the model s parameters .",
    "notwithstanding this , we have been able to show that the competition between the associated scaling fields , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , gives rise to an effective scaling picture in qualitative agreement with standard fss ideas .",
