    "already at the beginning of the last century , the idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions has been explored by nordstrm  @xcite , kaluza  @xcite and klein  @xcite . since superstring theory ,",
    "the most promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity , is consistent only in ten space - time dimensions ( 11 dimensions for m - theory ) these ideas have been revived in recent years  @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that string theories naturally predict lower dimensional  branes \" to which fermions and gauge particles are confined , while gravitons ( and the dilaton ) propagate in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been emphasized that relatively large extra - dimensions ( with typical length @xmath0 ) can `` solve '' the hierarchy problem : the effective four - dimensional newton constant given by @xmath1 can become very small even if the fundamental gravitational constant @xmath2 is of the order of the electroweak scale  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes the number of extra dimensions .",
    "it has also been shown that extra dimensions may even be infinite if the geometry contains a so - called  warp factor \" .",
    "an especially attractive model of this type , where the bulk is a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( @xmath4 ) space has been developed by randall and sundrum  @xcite .",
    "this is the model which we discuss in this work ; we shall call it rsii in what follows .",
    "the size of the extra dimensions is constrained by the requirement of recovering usual four - dimensional newton s law on the brane , at least on scales tested by experiments  @xcite .",
    "models with finite extra dimensions always have to invoke some nongravitational interaction in order to stabilize the graviscalar ( which is equivalent to the radion )  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of noncompact warped extra dimensions , it can happen that this mode is not normalizable and therefore can not be excited .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the rsii model .",
    "therefore , there is justified hope that , for suitable parameters , this model can reproduce four - dimensional gravity without invoking _ ad hoc _ additional interactions .",
    "however , we show in this paper that the gravitational sector coupled to a brane with nonvanishing anisotropic stresses does have negative mass modes .",
    "we argue that , on the linearized level , these instabilities are not relevant for the randall - sundrum model , but they may be devastating in the cosmological context where the brane is moving .    the tachyonic modes are absent if there are no anisotropic stresses . furthermore ,",
    "if anisotropic stresses remain small , they can not develop an instability .",
    "as we shall show , this is the case for the rsii model since there , to first order , anisotropic stresses evolve like in minkowski space - time and hence remain small ( if their minkowski evolution is not already unstable ) . in the cosmological context , however , this is no longer true and large deviations from homogeneity and isotropy may in principle develop .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , the perturbation theory on rsii is briefly introduced and the relevant perturbation equations are given .",
    "we present the solutions to the bulk perturbation equations and the junction conditions for tensor , vector and scalar modes .",
    "we pay particular attention to the tachyonic modes which are new and represent a possible instability . in section  [ liou ]",
    "we discuss the simple case of free - streaming , relativistic particles and show that they induce negative mass modes .",
    "we explicitly solve the equations for the rsii background and see that no instability is induced in this case .",
    "we then argue that , in principle , this behavior may change in a cosmological setting .    in sec .",
    "[ rsmod ] , we present a simple @xmath5 dimensional minkowski orbifold who s bulk modes exhibit the same instability as the @xmath4orbifold .",
    "we explicitly re - construct the instability from the retarded green s function , showing that it is causal . in this toy model ,",
    "instabilities develop due to nonlinear couplings .",
    "a final section is devoted to some conclusions .",

    "@xmath29 , the metric function @xmath30 has a kink .",
    "the advantage of the coordinate @xmath31 introduced in eq .",
    "is that the variable @xmath31 does not jump , but the metric function in the presence of a brane becomes @xmath32 .",
    "the einstein equations at the brane position are singular ; they contain a dirac - delta function . to avoid this",
    ", one can integrate them over the brane which leads to the so - called junction conditions  @xcite at the brane position .",

    "@xmath39 is the extrinsic curvature of the brane and @xmath40 is the induced metric on the brane .",

    "a short computation shows that the nonvanishing components of the extrinsic curvature tensor perturbations are in our case @xmath88 where @xmath89 are",

    "but in a realistic brane universe , @xmath89 is not exactly zero .",
    "in cosmology , it is just typically a factor of 10 smaller than other perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor on the brane .",
    "we therefore can not set @xmath99 .",
    "however , as long as @xmath89 remains small , we do not expect the unstable modes to be present ; hence we expect @xmath100 for @xmath87 . in the next section",
    ", we shall show in a specific example that this is indeed the case in rsii , where the brane is minkowski space and _ to linear order _ the anisotropic stress follows its background equation of motion .",
    "in the cosmological context , however , the evolution of @xmath89 contains @xmath101 which then can in principle feed the instability .",
    "one may ask , whether the unstable @xmath102 mode is a consequence of the thin brane limit .",
    "however , it is clear that in a thick brane , the kink of the @xmath102 mode at the brane position will simply be replaced by a rapid but gradual transition .",
    "the important point is that the presence of the brane cuts off the inner part @xmath21 of ads@xmath103 on which the @xmath102 mode would not be normalizable , and replaced it by a second copy of @xmath104 , rendering the @xmath102 mode normalizable in the bulk .",
    "it is this orbifold contruction and not the limit of an infinitely thin brane which leads to the instability .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath102 mode decays exponentially in @xmath26 direction ; it does not propagate into the bulk , but moves along the brane .",
    "however , due to its negative mass square ,",
    "@xmath105 , it is a tachyon and therefore provokes an instability , and its amplitude grows exponentially in time for sufficiently small wave numbers , @xmath87 .    in sec .",
    "[ rsmod ] we discuss a toy model , where we see explicitly how the exponential growth of @xmath101 can trigger an exponential growth of quantity on the brane it couples to , when nonlinear effects are taken into account . in that sense",
    "it is not clear that the rsii model is safe from this instability once non  linear effects are taken into account .",
    "the discovery of these tachyonic `` modes '' is already the main result of this work . in the next subsections",
    "we simply repeat our analysis for vector and scalar perturbations and show that exactly the same behavior is found there .",
    "in this section we follow closely ref .",
    "@xcite where the problem of vector perturbations has been considered in the cosmological context .",

    "fixes the relative amplitudes of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , showing that there is only one independent vector perturbation in the bulk ( the `` graviphoton '' ) .",

    "this is the one which enters as dynamical variable in the perturbed action ; see  @xcite ) , one finds that contrary to the tensor case , the vector zero - mode is not normalizable .",

    "the solution is therefore of the same form in all cases , @xmath208 before we determine the prefactor @xmath209 , and the resulting anisotropic stress @xmath210 , we fourier transform @xmath178 with respect to time .",
    "this yields @xmath211    for _ tensor _ perturbations , @xmath212~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find @xmath213 comparing this with eq .",
    "and using @xmath214 , we find that only modes with @xmath215 are excited and @xmath216 nevertheless , @xmath217 , so that only oscillating and no growing modes are excited .",
    "physically this result is not surprising .",
    "the distribution function of relativistic particles can not change faster than with the speed of light and hence modes with frequencies @xmath218 can not be excited .",
    "therefore , only the tachyonic modes are relevant .",
    "however , since @xmath219 is not unstable , there is no instability . only modes with @xmath220 , and hence @xmath221 are excited .",
    "we expect this to hold true whenever the temporal change in the perturbations is due to the motion of particles .    for vector and scalar perturbations ,",
    "one obtains similar results . for _ vector _ perturbations , we have @xmath222 and for _ scalar _ perturbations @xmath223    the detailed junction conditions are somewhat involved , but they evidently imply again that only the modes with @xmath224 are excited , @xmath225 hence only tachyonic modes , @xmath105 with @xmath226 are present .",
    "but , since the distribution function @xmath178 does not grow exponentially in time , truly unstable modes with @xmath227 are not allowed .",
    "this example is interesting in the sense that the new tachyonic modes play an important role , but no instability develops .      in a cosmological setup",
    ", we assume the brane to move in @xmath4 .",
    "the scale factor is then given by @xmath228 , where @xmath182 is conformal time on the brane .",
    "the cosmological equations for the unperturbed case are well known ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath229 with @xmath230 and @xmath231 . at low energy , @xmath232 or @xmath233",
    ", we recover the standard friedmann equations .",
    "brane motion significantly alters the junction condition .",
    "for instance , the perturbed junction condition for tensor perturbations   becomes @xmath234^{1/2}\\!{\\partial}_yh_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\bullet } } } }   = \\frac{{\\kappa}_5}{2}a^2\\pi_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\bullet}}}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath235 and @xmath26 denote bulk coordinates .",
    "clearly , @xmath236 is no longer separable and we have to rely on numerical simulations for its determination ( see  @xcite for recent works on the homogeneous case , @xmath237 ) .    in a cosmology dominated by relativistic collisionless particles ,",
    "metric perturbations enter in the first order perturbation eq .",
    ", since @xmath238 is now a background quantity .",
    "hence @xmath239 and @xmath240 must be determined simultaneously via eqs .  , and .",
    "it is not yet clear to us whether an instability may develop in the presence of anisotropic stresses .",
    "a detailed study is in preparation  @xcite .",
    "in sec .  ii we have found exponentially growing perturbations in the scalar , vector and tensor sectors of a rsii background . these can be generated from small , everywhere regular initial data . to complete the discussion , we have to specify a brane equation of motion for the anisotropic stresses and solve the full system . in the previous section we have shown that in the rsii model linear perturbations are still stable , but in a cosmological context , the coupling to metric perturbations might induce an instability . here",
    "we present , instead , a simple toy model , to show that nonlinearities can lead to instabilities already if the brane is flat minkowski space .",
    "we want to show the following : the instability which we have found is not due to an instability in the equation of motion of the anisotropic stresses on the brane nor to an instability of the bulk in absence of a brane .",
    "it is also not coming from the choice of the wrong boundary conditions ( incoming wave , advanced instead of retarded solution , etc . ) , but it is due entirely to the singular orbifold construction used in rsii .    only the fact that we have two copies of @xmath241",
    "renders the @xmath102 mode normalizable , which would otherwise diverge exponentially for @xmath242 . in the same way one obtains an instability if one glues together twice the same half of a simple minkowski space . to see this we consider four - dimensional minkowski space - time , with orbifoldlike spatial sections which can be identified with two copies of @xmath243 .",
    "the @xmath244 dimensional `` brane '' is represented by the plane @xmath245 and the `` bulk '' by two copies of @xmath246 .",
    "we consider a bulk field @xmath247 , which satisfies the ordinary hyperbolic wave equation , @xmath248 here @xmath249 are the coordinates parallel to the `` brane '' and @xmath250 . like for the metric in rsii ,",
    "we require @xmath251 to be continuous across the brane ( @xmath252 , but it may have a kink , i.e. , its derivative may jump .    confined on",
    "the brane is a field @xmath219 which is given by @xmath253    finally , we specify the equation of motion for @xmath219 on the brane ( the matter equation ) : @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the gradient on the brane .",
    "this resembles a `` covariant derivative '' with @xmath256 playing the role of the christoffel symbols .",
    "we first show that , if we do not allow for any `` singularity '' , i.e. , all fields and their first and second derivatives have to be continuous everywhere , this system has no instability .    in this case , the fundamental solutions are simply @xmath257~ , \\quad   { \\omega}^2 - { \\mathbf{p}}^2 = 0~,\\ ] ] with @xmath258 and @xmath259 . from eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath260~.\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that this is compatible with the equation of motion   for @xmath219 . clearly , these solutions do not exhibit any instability .",
    "they do not grow , but oscillate in time .",
    "for an observer confined to the brane , @xmath251 appears as a field with mass @xmath261 . for @xmath262",
    "fixed , this system can be seen as a system of two fields @xmath263 on the brane , satisfying @xmath264 and eq .  .",
    "this corresponds to a stable system of scalar fields on the brane .",
    "now we proceed to the orbifold construction .",
    "we require @xmath121 symmetry , @xmath265 , but allow @xmath266 to jump at @xmath245 .",
    "all the equations of motion remain the same .",
    "now , the previous solutions for @xmath251 have to be combined into @xmath121-symmetric linear combinations , @xmath267 +          \\phi_0\\exp\\left[\\pm i({\\omega}t-\\bar{{\\mathbf{p}}}{\\cdot}{\\mathbf{x}})\\right]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath268 if @xmath269 .",
    "such solutions are still regular ( continuous derivatives ) at @xmath245 .",

    "evidently , @xmath251 obeys the bulk wave eq .",
    "and @xmath219 satisfies its equation of motion  .    from the brane point of view",
    ", @xmath251 is now a tachyonic field with @xmath274 . in the pure brane model ( without a bulk )",
    "this solution would therefore not appear .",
    "it is clearly only due to the orbifold construction .",
    "since @xmath251 decays exponentially away from the brane , this solution also does not describe an ingoing wave .",
    "we finally want to address the question whether this solution may contain `` a - causal '' contributions ; or , more formally , whether it can be constructed from the retarded green s function alone .",
    "we choose as green s function for @xmath251 the one with @xmath275 then , green s formula gives ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath276~.\\ ] ] using the boundary conditions at @xmath245 for @xmath277 and @xmath251 , this yields @xmath278 the analogous expression for the rsii model is given in  @xcite .",
    "we now construct the retarded green s function obeying the boundary condition  .",
    "we perform a fourier transform in @xmath279 and @xmath280 so that   becomes @xmath281 the boundary condition   is satisfied by the modes @xmath282 with the correct normalization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we obtain the retarded green s function @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the heaviside function , @xmath285 up to a factor @xmath130 which is due to @xmath121 symmetry , this is just the standard retarded green s function of the four - dimensional wave equation .    in order to show that our unstable solution   does not invoke any a - causalities , i.e. , contributions from an advanced green s function ,",
    "we now show that it can be obtained from the retarded green s function   by means of eq .  .",
    "we perform the calculations for @xmath246 and then invoke @xmath121 symmetry for @xmath286 .",
    "equations   and   imply @xmath287 where @xmath288 . with @xmath289 , integration over @xmath279 and @xmath204 finally gives @xmath290 here @xmath291 is the bessel function of order @xmath9 .",
    "for the last equal sign we used the integral no .",
    "6.645.2 in  @xcite .",
    "this proves that @xmath251 from eq .",
    "is a purely retarded solution and hence represents a true physical instability of the system .",
    "we have shown that the perturbation equations of the rsii model allow for tachyonic modes which can be exponentially unstable .",
    "we have then argued that , within first order perturbation theory , the rsii model remains stable .",
    "nevertheless , we have given an example where the new tachyonic modes play a crucial role . in the cosmological context ,",
    "the situation is significantly different and tachyonic modes could in principle lead to instabilities . since metric perturbations are no longer separable , we have to rely on numerical simulations .",
    "we do not yet know whether an instability may develop in the presence of anisotropic stresses .",
    "a more detailed study will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    within a toy model",
    ", we have shown that the exponentially growing bulk modes do not come from an instability of the brane equations of motion or from the use of an inadequate green s function , but are due to the singular orbifold construction .",
    "as we show explicitly in our toy model , the unstable modes can be obtained using the retarded green s function .",
    "the toy model also shows that , taking into account nonlinearities , even a flat minkowski - space brane can become unstable .",
    "starting with small regular initial data on some hypersurface of constant time , an exponential instability can build up in an @xmath4orbifold .",
    "it remains to be examined whether this instability stays exponential also in the cosmological context of a brane moving through @xmath4 , or if it disappears in an expanding universe like the jeans instability of newtonian gravity .",
    "this question is of uttermost importance .",
    "if exponentially unstable modes are generated either on the first or second order , this will inhibit the realization of cosmology in terms of a rsii braneworld .",
    "one may then go even further and ask whether such orbifold constructions may not lead to instabilities in a much broader sense than what has been discussed here .",
