    "the physics of low - dimensional lattices of quantum spins is especially rich and varied . as a consequence ,",
    "a great deal of effort has gone into understanding the statics and dynamics of these systems . however , despite this effort , many fundamental questions about quantum lattice models remain unanswered .",
    "perhaps one of the most pressing of these questions is : can we _ faithfully _ approximate , at least via some efficient numerical procedure , the ground - state properties of quantum lattice systems ?",
    "if this were not true for physically realistic models then we would have to give up any hope of extracting theoretical predictions from these models .",
    "it is a folk theorem that , at least in one dimension , an approximation to the ground - state properties of a _ noncritical _ @xcite chain of quantum spins may be obtained efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "significant progress towards proving this theorem has been obtained recently in a ground - breaking paper by hastings @xcite .",
    "hastings found a procedure whereby an approximation to the ground state of a noncritical quantum spin system could be obtained and stored using subexponential resources that scale as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is some constant which depends on the spectral gap @xmath3 and the local spin dimension .",
    "the computational complexity of this method is not far off the expected result , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is some constant .",
    "there is one procedure which appears to provide arbitrarily good approximations to the ground - state properties of @xmath1d noncritical quantum spin systems , namely , the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for a description of the dmrg and its relatives . )",
    "the dmrg is the premier tool used in numerical explorations of the physics of 1d quantum systems , and has been used with unparalleled success in simulating both their statics , and more recently , dynamics .",
    "many exciting extensions of the dmrg have been developed , including , a powerful variant for 2d systems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the dmrg is not known to be _",
    "correct_. that is , it is unclear if the dmrg always faithfully returns an approximation to the ground state and not some other low - lying excited state .",
    "additionally , the _ complexity _ of the dmrg is currently unknown .",
    "it is entirely possible , in principle , that the dmrg requires exponential resources to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground - state of noncritical spin system .",
    "however , extensive numerical experimentation strongly indicates that the dmrg requires only _ linear _ resources in @xmath2 to simulate noncritical systems .",
    "nevertheless , hard instances for variants of the dmrg do exist @xcite , which means that we must be cautious when applying the dmrg in certain situations .",
    "this strongly suggests that while the _ average - case _ complexity of the dmrg may be polynomial , the _ worst - case _ complexity is probably exponential .",
    "the dmrg can be thought of as a variational minimisation of the energy over the class of _ finitely correlated states _ or _ matrix product states _ ( for an introduction to finitely correlated states and a detailed description of their properties see @xcite ) .",
    "finitely correlated states are particularly well - suited to this task because : ( a ) it is expected that they approximate realistic ground states well ; and ( b ) there is an efficient computational procedure to extract local properties , like correlators , from a state stored as a finitely correlated state .",
    "the validity of the fcs ground - state ansatz is conditioned , at least , on the truth of ( a ) , thus it is very desirable to show that good approximations to the ground states of some physically interesting class of spin systems could be stored efficiently as a fcs .",
    "there are many ways to obtain an approximation to the ground state of a quantum system .",
    "for example , in the case of the dmrg , there are variants @xcite which obtain ground - state approximations via imaginary time evolution . however , in this paper , we d like to emphasise another method to obtain ground - state approximations , namely , via adiabatic continuation .",
    "the idea with adiabatic continuation is to start with a hamiltonian @xmath13 whose ground - state is known exactly , and then to adiabatically vary along a path of hamiltonians @xmath14 until the desired hamiltonian @xmath15 is reached . under the adiabatic dynamics , the state at the end of the evolution will be the ground state of the final hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "the spectral gap @xmath16 between the ground- and first - excited state energy of @xmath14 provides the fundamental obstruction to approximating adiabatic dynamics : the smaller @xmath16 is , the harder it is to approximate the dynamics . at this point",
    "we d like to point out an obvious ( but crucial ) fact : if arbitrary paths @xmath14 are allowed then @xmath16 can be made as large as desired up to @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the context of spin systems , we do nt allow arbitrary paths because they would presumably lead to an unphysical situation where @xmath14 contains interactions between many spins .",
    "rather , we demand that @xmath14 has only _ local _ interactions throughout the path @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this additional constraint motivates us to define the notion of _ adiabatic connectivity _ : two quantum spin systems @xmath19 and @xmath20 are said to be _ adiabatically connected _ if there exists a path of _ local _ hamiltonians @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the spectral gap for @xmath21 satisfies @xmath24 for all",
    "@xmath25 $ ] .    in the case",
    "that a hamiltonian @xmath19 is adiabatically connected to another hamiltonian @xmath20 via a path @xmath21 with @xmath26 it turns out that ground - state properties of @xmath19 can be _ efficiently _ and _ certifiably _ obtained from those of @xmath20 @xcite . because of certain counterexample systems for dmrg methods @xcite it appears that adiabatic continuation is the only method whereby certifiable approximations to the ground - state can be obtained efficiently .",
    "thus , the problem of understanding the ground - state properties of a quantum spin system @xmath19 can be reduced to finding a hamiltonian for a well - understood spin system @xmath20 which is adiabatically connected to @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of proving that the isolated eigenstates of a certain class of noncritical quantum spin systems can be efficiently represented as finitely correlated states with polynomial computational storage resources ( in @xmath2 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "( the reason we say  isolated eigenstates \" here is because our subsequent derivations make no use of the fact that the eigenstate in question is the ground state . for example , the argument applies equally to the highest - energy eigenstate . ) the noncritical systems we consider are local hamiltonians which satisfy a crucial additional requirement : we assume that the ground state @xmath4 of the system on @xmath6 spins is _ locally _ close to the ground state @xmath8 for @xmath2 spins , where @xmath2 is arbitrarily large .",
    "this is a fundamental physical assumption which , philosophically , underlies the success of the dmrg and relatives . in the case that this requirement is satisfied we show @xmath0 _ is _ adiabatically connected to a hamiltonian @xmath20 whose ground state is exactly and efficiently known . as a consequence ,",
    "if we know the ground - state energy @xmath28 for all @xmath2 , we show that the ground state of @xmath0 may be efficiently approximated by a finitely correlated state .",
    "we will , for the sake of clarity , describe our results mainly for a finite chain @xmath29 of @xmath2 distinguishable spin-@xmath30 particles .",
    "the family @xmath19 of local hamiltonians we focus on ( which implicitly depends on @xmath2 ) is defined by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 acts nontrivially only on spins @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we set the energy scale by assuming that @xmath35 scales as a constant with @xmath2 for all @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the operator norm .",
    "we can easily accommodate next - nearest neighbour interactions etc .  by blocking sites and thinking of the blocks as new ( larger ) spins .",
    "however this can only be done a constant number of times : the quality of our approximation will decrease exponentially with the number of such blockings .",
    "we do not assume translational invariance .",
    "we make three major assumptions about our system .",
    "the first is that the spectrum of @xmath38 has a spectral gap @xmath39 between the ground - state energy and the first - excited state energy which is always strictly positive and scales as a constant with @xmath2 .",
    "( this is the _ noncriticality _ assumption . )",
    "the second assumption we make is that the ground - state energy is set to zero .",
    "this is the principle reason why our analysis does not allow us to , in principle , efficiently calculate approximations to ground - state properties of @xmath19 because to perform this operation we need to know @xmath40  it is potentially a computationally difficult task to approximate the ground - state energy eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "our final assumption is that the ground state @xmath4 for @xmath6 spins , with @xmath6 an @xmath7 constant , is _ locally similar _ to @xmath8 , with @xmath2 arbitrarily large .",
    "this means that there exist unitary operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 which act nontrivially only on a contiguous block @xmath43 ( respectively , @xmath44 ) of a constant number @xmath45 of spins located at the left ( respectively , right ) end of the block of @xmath6 spins such that fidelity @xmath46 is an @xmath7 constant independent of @xmath2 , where @xmath47 is the reduced density operator for @xmath8 on @xmath6 contiguous spins . in words :",
    "we assume that the ground state @xmath4 of @xmath5 has some overlap with @xmath8 when we are allowed to apply some correction operations to the ends of the chain of @xmath6 spins .",
    "the physical idea underlying this assumption is that for noncritical spin systems the ground state of @xmath6 spins ought to be the same as that for @xmath48 spins apart from boundary effects which should persist only a distance @xmath49 , with @xmath10 some constant , into the bulk of the ground state of both systems . while this is physically reasonable",
    "we ve been unable to show that it s true for all noncritical spin systems .",
    "hence we make this an assumption .",
    "we are going to make a further simplifying assumption about the systems we are considering , namely that the overlap @xmath50 is an @xmath7 constant .",
    "this is obviously a far stronger assumption than that of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) .",
    "however , it turns out that this assumption entails no loss of generality in our subsequent derivations .",
    "the way to see this is to first notice that the state @xmath51 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are chosen as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) , is the unique gapped ground state of @xmath52 . as long as",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 act on only a small number of spins ( in comparison to @xmath6 ) near the boundary then @xmath53 will also be a local hamiltonian .",
    "our subsequent analysis only requires that our start hamiltonian @xmath53 contains local interactions .",
    "before we end this section we introduce some notation for approximations .",
    "if we have two quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 then we use the notation @xmath56 to denote the estimate @xmath57 for some constant @xmath58 independent of @xmath2 . because we ll be interested in the consequences of allowing the minimum gap @xmath3 and the overlap @xmath59 to depend on @xmath2 we ll explicitly retain any dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath59 in our calculations .",
    "in this section we construct a hamiltonian @xmath20 , whose ground state is known exactly , and which is adiabatically connected to @xmath0 .",
    "we construct @xmath20 iteratively : we show that the hamiltonian @xmath60 , which we define to consist of two copies @xmath54 and @xmath55 of @xmath5 , is adiabatically connected to @xmath61 .",
    "thus we `` glue '' the ground states of @xmath54 and @xmath55 together via adiabatic continuation .",
    "we then show that the adiabatic continuation from @xmath60 to @xmath61 can be approximated by a unitary operator which acts on only a constant number of sites across the boundary between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we then iterate this gluing procedure to obtain the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : gluing ] for a schematic illustration of our procedure .     for @xmath5 together via adiabatic continuation to obtain an approximation to the ground state of @xmath61 . ]",
    "we describe our method in a slightly more general context : we show how to glue together two systems @xmath54 and @xmath55 of @xmath6 and @xmath62 spins , respectively .",
    "the way we show that a good approximation @xmath63 to the ground state @xmath64 can be stored efficiently is to consider the ( adiabatic ) dynamics of an auxiliary system @xmath65 which is constructed in the following way .",
    "first fix @xmath2 , the total number of spins .",
    "next partition the chain into two contiguous blocks @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ". now consider the following hamiltonian @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an interaction term , to be defined , which spans the boundary between the two blocks .",
    "( @xmath67 will not be the same as @xmath68 , the interaction term in @xmath19 which spans the boundary . )",
    "if @xmath54 consists of the first @xmath6 spins , @xmath69 , then @xmath55 consists of the last @xmath62 spins and we define @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is some constant .",
    "thus we can write @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we note that @xmath20 has a unique ground state and spectral gap @xmath3 because of the assumed spectral structure of the _ family _",
    "@xmath0 , i.e. , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 belong to the family @xmath0 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "we set the constant @xmath71 so that the ground - state energy of @xmath20 is zero .",
    "( recall that we ve already set the zero of energy by requiring the ground - state energy of @xmath19 is @xmath79 . )",
    "now we construct a new system @xmath80 whose hilbert space is a _ direct sum _ of two copies of the old hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath81 for the new system is a direct sum of @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath82 the hilbert space for our new system is thus given by @xmath83 .",
    "we think of this hilbert space as that of the original chain @xmath29 of @xmath2 spins with an extra spin , which we call @xmath84 , that lives between spins @xmath85 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath81 as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "we next observe , by the assumed properties of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , that the spectrum @xmath88 of @xmath81 has the following structure .",
    "firstly , the hamiltonian @xmath81 has a doubly degenerate ground eigenspace spanned by the vectors @xmath89 ) is the ground state of @xmath19 ( respectively , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath81 then has a gap @xmath3 which is larger than some constant , irrespective of the number @xmath2 of spins .    to construct our final auxiliary system @xmath65 we consider the parameter - dependent hamiltonian @xmath90 where @xmath91 we note that @xmath92 is positive semidefinite and it acts nontrivially only on the auxiliary spin .",
    "thus , to find the ground state of @xmath93 we can restrict our attention to subspace spanned by latexmath:[$\\{|0\\rangle|\\omega_h\\rangle ,     the addition of the operator @xmath92 will perturb all of the eigenvectors of @xmath81 .",
    "however , by weyl s perturbation theorem @xcite , as long as @xmath95 the operator @xmath92 will not mix the ground subspace of @xmath81 with the remaining eigenvectors of @xmath93 ; this subspace will always be separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the subspace itself is unchanged : only the eigenvectors within this subspace change under the addition of @xmath92 .",
    "thus we fix @xmath96 , so @xmath97 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath92 in the ground eigenspace of @xmath81 are given by @xmath98 the two eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix correspond to the ground state and first excited state of @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding gap of @xmath92 is @xmath99 which has a minimum value equal to @xmath100 at @xmath101 , where @xmath59 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) .",
    "we think of the @xmath92 contribution in @xmath93 as _ polarising _ the system @xmath81 so it has a unique gapped ground state @xmath102 by the discussion in the previous paragraph the gap above this ground state is always larger than @xmath103 .    the idea behind our proof is now simple to state .",
    "we begin with the system @xmath65 in the ground state @xmath104 from @xmath79 to @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting ground state is @xmath106 .",
    "this is a product state between the original chain @xmath29 and @xmath84 .",
    "we then discard the ancilla spin @xmath84 to obtain the ground state of @xmath29 .",
    "we approximate this exact adiabatic evolution with a unitary operator which acts nontrivially only on a small set @xmath107 of spins across the boundary between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the adiabatic evolution of the ground state @xmath108 of @xmath93 is generated by the solution of the differential equation @xmath109\\mathcal{u}(\\theta ; 0),\\ ] ] where @xmath110 .",
    "this is an example of an exact adiabatic evolution ( see app .",
    "[ app : appendix1 ] for more discussion of exact adiabatic evolution ) .",
    "we approximate the exact adiabatic evolution @xmath111 by _ quasi - adiabatic _ evolution which , for us , is defined by the solution of the differential equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 is some constant to be set later , and @xmath115 .",

    "the infinitesimal generator @xmath116 of quasi - adiabatic evolution is an operator which is _ approximately local _ in a region @xmath117 of @xmath118 sites surrounding the boundary between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the way to see this intuitively is to recognise that @xmath119 is strictly local in the region @xmath43 , and the operator @xmath120 is a local operator evolved according to a local hamiltonian for some time which is approximately less than some constant @xmath114 .",
    "we make this intuition precise by applying a lieb - robinson bound @xcite ( see @xcite for a simple direct proof )",

    "we want to show that the quasi - adiabatic dynamics generated by @xmath133 : @xmath135 are close to the quasi - adiabatic dynamics @xmath136 generated by @xmath137 .",
    "we do this by exploiting the inequality @xmath138 which is proved , for example , by exploiting the lie - trotter expansion .",
    "we now show how the lieb - robinson bound provides an estimate on the decay of @xmath139 .",
    "consider @xmath140 where @xmath141 , and in the first line we applied the triangle inequality , in the second line we applied the lieb - robinson bound , and in the third line we ve broken the integral into two pieces and applied the different regimes of the lieb - robinson bound separately with @xmath10 some constant and we ve used the fact that @xmath142 . thus , by choosing @xmath143 we see that @xmath144 is decaying exponentially fast in @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",

    "the representation eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcsrep1 ] ) is equivalent @xcite to a finitely correlated state requiring a number of degrees of freedom which scale as @xmath187 , where @xmath10 is some constant .",

    "the dynamics generated by the adiabatic evolution of a quantum system is an important paradigm in the study of quantum mechanics .",
    "one question which is particularly pertinent for the simulation of quantum systems is : can adiabatic evolution be simulated by the time - dependent dynamics of some ( possibly different ) quantum system ? in the case of adiabatic evolution",
    "the answer is yes : one method is to just slowly turn on the interactions on a timescale which is small compared to the gap of the system .",
