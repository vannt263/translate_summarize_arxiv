    "the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 , located close to the galactic center ( @xmath644 arcmin from sgr a * ) , is a well - known massive star - forming region in our galaxy .",
    "sgr b2 consists of an extended envelope , a hot ring and a few compact cores ( e.g. goicoechea , rodriguze - fernandez & cernicharo 2004 ) .",
    "the radio continuum and recombination line observations of the compact hii regions suggest that sgr b2(n ) and sgr  b2  ( m ) are the two most active star forming cores in this region ( gaume & claussen 1990 ; gaume et al .",
    "1995 , mehringer et al . 1993 ; de pree et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "masers , outflows and possible rotation of the two dense cores have been revealed from observations of various molecular lines at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths ( reid et al .",
    "1988 ; gaume & claussen 1990 ; martin - pintado et al .",
    "1990 ; mehringer , goss & palmer 1994 ; lis et al . 1993 ; kuan & snyder 1996 ; liu & snyder 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , previous observations have shown evidence for the two hot cores to be at different evolutionary stages and to have different molecular abundances ( e.g. vogel et al . 1987 ; lis et al .",
    "1993 ; miao et al .",
    "1995 ; kuan , mehringer & snyder 1996 ; liu & snyder 1999 ) .",
    "h@xmath0co pervades the interstellar medium and it has a simple chemical reaction path which has been proven to be a useful probe of physical conditions ( e.g. mangum & wootten 1993 ) .",
    "the h@xmath7co ( 1@xmath8 ) transition at 6 cm was observed in absorption against discrete continuum sources towards sgr b2 complex with an angular resolution of @xmath9 , showing nearly the same radial velocity pattern as that of the radio recombination lines ( martin - pintado et al .",
    "1990 ; mehringer , palmer & goss 1995 ) .",
    "these authors suggested that the h@xmath7co ( 1@xmath8 ) transition probably arises from the surrounding gas with a relatively low mean h@xmath7 density of @xmath10 @xmath11 ( martin - pintado et al .",
    "1990 ; mehringer , palmer & goss 1995 ) .    the millimeter h@xmath7co lines are an excellent tracer of h@xmath7 density @xmath12 @xmath11 ( e.g. , mangum & wootten 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , h@xmath7co is a planar asymmetric top molecule with very little asymmetry .",
    "the symmetry of the spin function of the molecule leads to two transition classes : ortho - h@xmath7co levels if the spin wavefunction is symmetric and para - h@xmath7co levels if antisymmetric . since para - h@xmath7co is 1 - 3 times less abundant than ortho - h@xmath7co , observations of para - h@xmath7co have less opacity effect ( kahane et al 1984 ; mangum & wootten 1993 ) .",
    "hence , para - h@xmath7co appears to be a better probe to determine the physical conditions of the massive star formation regions .",
    "the millimeter / submillimeter transitions of h@xmath7co gas require relatively high excitation temperature and high h@xmath7 density compared to those in the centimeter wavebands .",
    "if the brightness temperature of the continuum emission is higher than the excitation temperature , the absorption against the continuum cores can be observed in millimeter and sub - millimeter wavebands with the high angular resolution of an interferometric array ( such as the submillimeter array , hereafter sma ) .",
    "taking advantage of the large bandwidth coverage of the sma , we have observed multiple h@xmath7co lines towards sgr b2 at 1.3 mm within a bandwidth of 2 ghz .",
    "thus , with the same telescope system and calibration procedure , the uncertainties due to absolute flux density calibration among the different line transitions can be mitigated by measuring the line - intensity ratios , which are needed to determine physical conditions , such as kinetic temperature and h@xmath7 number density , of the gas .",
    "in addition , the sma is not sensitive to extended larger scale emission ( @xmath6 50 )",
    ". thus , the sma observations are sensitive to the clumps of high density gas rather than the extended diffuse components .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results from the sma observations of sgr b2 at the h@xmath7co lines and continuum at 1.3 mm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 discusses the observations and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we present the data analysis and results . in  4 , we present the kinematics in sgr b2(m ) by a model incorporating a spherically symmetric inflow along with a decelerating outflow . in ",
    "5 we model the physical properties of the h@xmath7co gas in sgr b2 using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approach . in  6 , we discuss the important results derived from our observations and analysis .",
    "we summarize the results in  7 .",
    "we adopt a distance of 8 kpc to sgr b2 .",
    "observations towards sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) were carried out at 218 ( lower sideband ) and 228 ghz ( upper sideband ) with seven antennas of the sma in the compact - north array on august 1 , 2005 for 8 hours .",
    "the projected baselines ranged from 5 to 50 k@xmath13 .",
    "the weather was good during the observations with @xmath14@xmath60.09 at 225 ghz .",
    "the typical system temperature was 130 k. sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) were observed in separate fields with 15 min observing time on each source interleaving 5 min on the phase reference source sgr a * ( @xmath15 mas , @xmath63 jy at 230 ghz , @xmath645 arcmin from sgr b2 ) .",
    "our two target fields were centered at ra(j2000)=17@xmath1647@xmath1719@xmath18882 , dec(j2000)=@xmath1922@xmath2018@xmath2137 and ra(j2000)=17@xmath1647@xmath1720@xmath22156 , dec(j2000)=@xmath1923@xmath2003@xmath2156 , for sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , callisto ( 4.1 jy ) and the qso 3c454.3 ( 32 jy ) were also observed for the flux - density and bandpass calibrations .",
    "the flux density was estimated from callisto with the assumption that its brightness temperature was 120 k and its angular size was 1@xmath2114 .",
    "the three transitions h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath23 ) , ( 3@xmath24 ) and ( 3@xmath25 ) were positioned in the lower 2 ghz sideband ( lsb ) .",
    "h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath24 ) emission appears to be blended with a transition of ch@xmath26oh and will be not used in the analysis in this paper .",
    "the two unblended transitions , h@xmath7co , ( 3@xmath23 ) and ( 3@xmath25 ) , have upper level energies of 21.0 and 67.8 k and rest frequencies of 218.2222 and 218.7601 ghz , respectively .",
    "the spectral resolution of 0.8125 mhz corresponds to a velocity resolution of 1.1 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the data reduction was carried out in _",
    "miriad_. we recomputed the doppler velocity for each of the target sources since the on - line doppler tracking was only made on sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "system temperature corrections were applied .",
    "antenna - based bandpass ripples were corrected by applying the linear interpolation of the bandpass solutions determined from callisto and 3c454.3 .",
    "there are spectral - window - based offsets in amplitude and phase on some baselines due to the correlator errors , which were also corrected .",
    "the residual errors due to the bandpass shape of the individual spectral windows were reduced to a level below 1% of the continuum level . in the antenna - based gain corrections , we chose the visibilities of sgr  a * in the uv range between 20 kilo wavelengths and longer in order to eliminate the contamination from the extended dust and hii emission .",
    "the gains determined from the point source ( emission from sgr a * ) were applied to the sgr  b2 data .",
    "the molecular lines were identified in the rest frame by use of the jpl catalog , as done by others ( sutton et al .",
    "1985 and nummelin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the h@xmath7co transitions and a few other molecular lines have been unambiguously identified ( see spectrum in fig .",
    "the continuum was subtracted with a linear fitting to the spectrum of line - free channels in each baseline . for sgr",
    "b2(m ) , the line - free channels can be easily selected from the spectrum in the ( u , v ) domain ( fig .",
    "however , for sgr  b2(n ) , the molecular spectral lines are crowded over each 2 ghz band and it is difficult to choose the line - free channels .",
    "we developed a procedure to select the line - free channels for the continuum subtraction .",
    "first , after reducing of the spectral resolution to 1 km  s@xmath4 , we made each of the channel maps ( 2600 channels over the 2 ghz band ) including both the line and continuum .",
    "from the channel maps , we selected the channels without extended emission ( @xmath274@xmath28 ) . the continuum level was determined from these apparently line - free channels .",
    "we selected 16 and 37 line - free spectral windows for the fields of sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) , respectively .",
    "then , using the task uvlin in _ miriad _ , we determined the continuum level by fitting to the line - free channels .",
    "the uvlin gives two output ( u , v ) data sets , one for the continuum and the other for continuum - free spectral line .",
    "self - calibration was performed to the continuum data using the compact sources of the continuum cores for a few iterations in order to eliminate residual errors .",
    "the gain solutions determined from the continuum data were applied to the line data , from which we constructed the spectral data cube .",
    "the preliminary images of the continuum and lines were made using natural weighting .",
    "the clean algorithm was applied to remove the effects of the side - lobes .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes of the continuum and line images were approximately 5@xmath29 ( pa=12.5@xmath30 ) .",
    "the mosaic maps of the two fields , sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) , were made using a simple linear mosaic algorithm .",
    "the primary beam attenuation was also corrected in the final line cubes and continuum image .",
    "the statistical 1@xmath28 rms noise of the continuum was 0.1 jy  beam@xmath4 .",
    "the 1@xmath28 rms noise levels of the line images were 0.18 and 0.16 jy  beam@xmath4 per channel for the h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath23 ) and ( 3@xmath25 ) lines , respectively .",
    "the higher noise in the h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath23 ) line images was due to its strong line intensity and the limit of the dynamic range in the clean process .",
    "2 shows the mosaic continuum map of sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) at 1.3 mm . the brightest components of sgr  b2(n ) ( i@xmath31=29.2@xmath32.1 jy  beam@xmath4 ) and sgr  b2(m ) ( i@xmath31=20.2@xmath31.3 jy  beam@xmath4 ) , are associated with the massive star forming cores k1 - 3 and f1 - 4 ( gaume & claussen 1990 ) , respectively .",
    "in addition to the emission from these cores , a few nearby continuum clumps were detected , including the components k4 ( i@xmath32=1.40@xmath30.12 jy  beam@xmath4 ) , ne ( i@xmath31=1.20@xmath30.14 jy  beam@xmath4 ) , nw ( i@xmath32=1.00@xmath30.11 jy  beam@xmath4 ) , me ( i@xmath32=0.58@xmath30.15 jy  beam@xmath4 ) and mw ( i@xmath32=1.70@xmath30.18 jy  beam@xmath4 ) .",
    "gaussian fitting to the individual continuum components was carried out .",
    "the individual emission clumps near the compact cores or the k1 - 3 and f1 - 4 clusters were modeled as simple gaussian components .",
    "the two compact cores , k1 - 3 and f1 - 4 , appeared to be too complicated to be fitted with single gaussian components . a model consisting of a gaussian and two unresolved compact components was used to fit to the data of the core ( k1 - 3 ) .",
    "the peaks of the gaussian component and one of the point components are consistent with k3 and k2 positions , respectively .",
    "another point component agrees ( within @xmath6 1@xmath33 ) with the 3.5 mm continuum source that is located south of k3 ( see fig.1(b ) of liu & snyder 1999 ) .",

    "the peak positions , deconvolved angular sizes , peak intensities and total flux densities of the continuum components are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the components k4 , mw and z10.24 have been detected at radio and millimeter wavelengths ( lis et al . 1993 ; kuan & snyder 1994 ; gaume et al .",

    "the sma observations show an elongated structure in z10.24 with a peak intensity of 2.02 @xmath3 0.16 jy beam@xmath4 ( 12 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the core of z10.24 is unresolved in the sub - arcsec resolution images at both 1.3 cm and 3.5 mm ( gaume et al .",
    "1995 ; liu & snyder 1999 ) . the 1.3 mm continuum image and the detected vibrational hc@xmath26n emission ( de vicente et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that the 1.3 mm continuum of z10.24 is dominated by the dust emission and z10.24 is likely to be a younger massive star formation region .",
    "there have been no detections of the components nw , ne and me in the previous observations at longer wavelengths .",
    "these three components are possibly the dust emission from sub - cores at a relatively early stage of star formation .",
    "the detections need to be verified with further observations at shorter wavelengths and at higher angular resolutions .",
    "the continuum - free channel maps in both h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath23 ) and h@xmath7co ( 3@xmath25 ) lines were constructed in the velocity range from 8 to 151 km  s@xmath4 at intervals of 1 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the channel maps of the h@xmath7co transitions are complicated , containing several kinematical features in either emission or absorption .",
    "those emission and absorption components are separated well in our higher spectral resolution maps but some of them ( in the continuum core regions ) are overlapped . in the moment analysis , the negative intensity value from the absorption and the positive value from the emission may cancel each other in the overlapping regions and thus the resultant moment maps might not reflect the true gas distribution .",
    "hence , the emission and absorption need to be handled separately .      fig . 3 is the integrated line emission images constructed from the channel maps for the two transitions , h@xmath7co ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "the moment 0 images were made with a 4 @xmath28 cutoff in each channel maps .",
    "the less significant emission and the absorption are excluded in the moment analysis .",
    "most of emission is distributed around the two cores of sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) . clearly , the distribution of the h@xmath7co emission is not spherically symmetric with respect to each of these cores . in the sgr",
    "b2(n ) region , in addition to the gas concentration at the core , gas clumps located north - east and south - west of the core are observed in both h@xmath7co transitions .",
    "we note that in sgr  b2(n ) , the morphology of h@xmath7co ( @xmath2 ) emission , the higher transition gas , is similar to that of the emission from the lower transition gas h@xmath7co ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "hereafter we refer h@xmath7co ( @xmath2 ) as the higher transition and h@xmath7co ( @xmath1 ) as the lower transition . in the sgr",
    "b2(m ) region , a strong emission component elongated in northwest - southeast direction is observed in both h@xmath7co transitions .",
    "an arch structure ( m1   30@xmath33 long and 10@xmath33 wide ) , 8@xmath33 northwest of the sgr  b2(m ) core appears in both h@xmath7co transitions .",
    "the major difference in the emission distribution from the two transitions occurs in the outflow ( lis et al .",
    "1993 ) region located south - east of the sgr  b2(m ) core . a significant emission `` tongue '' ( m5 ) ( 15@xmath36 )",
    "was detected from the higher h@xmath7co transition gas while no significant detection was made of the lower h@xmath7co transition gas .",
    "based on a line survey at 340 ghz from single dish observations , sutton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) obtained mean systematic velocities 65 and 61 km  s@xmath4 of sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) .",
    "their observations showed significant velocity variations among the different species .",
    "the differences are mostly caused by the chemical differences of the molecules .",
    "the different species sample different physical environments .",
    "the high angular resolution observations of h66@xmath34 ( de pree et al . 1995 ; 1996 ) showed that the mean systematic velocities are 69.8 and 65.3 km  s@xmath4 for the sgr b2(m)-f and sgr b2(n)-k clusters , respectively .",
    "the relatively higher mean velocity of 69.8 km  s@xmath4 in sgr b2(m ) is likely caused by the high velocity motion of the ionized gas of the uchii regions with respect to the centroid of the system . in section 4",
    ", we will show that the systematic velocity determined from the terminal velocity of the outflow in sgr  b2(m ) is 58 km s@xmath4 ( see also appendix a ) . in the rest of the paper , we adopt systematic velocities of 58 km s@xmath4 and 65 km s@xmath4 for sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) , respectively .",
    "the strong continuum cores are excellent probes of absorption by the cold gas that resides in front of them .",
    "absorption is observed towards both sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) continuum cores ( see the top - left and bottom - left panels of fig .",
    "multiple gaussian line components were fitted to the spectra for each of the two transitions in both cores .",
    "the parameters of these fits are listed in table 2 .",
    "the systematic velocities are marked with the vertical lines in fig .",
    "the majority of the absorbing gas in sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) is red - shifted with respect to the systematic velocities 58 and 65 km  s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the red - shifted absorption gas provides evidence for the existence of gas accreting onto the two cores .",
    "if the absorbing gas covers the continuum source completely and the emission from the gas is insignificant , the line intensity is @xmath37 .",
    "the optical depth ( @xmath38 ) can be derived from the formula    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the observed line intensity and the @xmath41 is the observed continuum intensity .",

    "the southeast - northwest velocity gradient observed from the h@xmath7co emission gas in sgr  b2(n ) appears to be caused by a combination of rotation , infall and outflow .",
    "the angular resolution of our observations is not adequate to discern the details of these motions .",
    "in order to better understand the on - going astrophysical processes in the star formation cores , we modeled the observed kinematics and the ratio of the line intensities . in comparison to sgr  b2(n ) , the kinematics observed from sgr  b2(m ) appears to be relatively simple and characterized by infall and outflow .",

    "the major axis of the red - shifted outflow ( pa=158@xmath30 ) can be drawn by connecting the continuum core and the tips of the outflows ( m1 and m5 ) .    along the major axis of outflow ( pa=158@xmath30 ) , we have made a position - velocity diagram ( pv ) from the higher h@xmath7co transition line cube ( see fig . 8) . the solid contours show the emission and dashed contours indicate the absorption .",
    "this diagram shows two distinct decelerating outflow components clearly .",
    "the red - shifted component shows that the emission near the core ( position at 0  in the vertical axis ) starts with a high velocity of 106 km s@xmath4 and the velocity declines to a terminal velocity at 58 km s@xmath4 as the gas goes to the outer region ( 20away from the core ) .",
    "if we shifted velocity to the terminal velocity 58 km s@xmath4 or in the system rest frame , the decelerating red - shifted outflow is mainly located in the first quadrant with the absolute velocity decreasing from @xmath648 to 0 km s@xmath4 .",

    "our observations and analysis have shown the presence of a decelerating outflow from the core in sgr b2(m ) .",
    "such a decelerating outflow can be caused by the entrainment of gas through the interaction between a fast wind flow from the central stars and an ambient cloud core , where the incorporation of additional mass into the outflow decelerates the wind ( lizano et al .",
    "1988 ) . as the wind moves farther from the cores , the outflow velocity terminates at the systematic velocity 58 km s@xmath4 of the molecular cloud .",

    "in fact , the common terminal velocity 58@xmath32 km s@xmath4 of blue - shifted and red - shifted outflow appears to provide an unambiguous method , independent of the chemical processes in molecular clouds , for accurately measuring the systematic velocity of sgr b2(m ) . the uncertainty in the terminal velocity is mainly due to the velocity resolution in the pv diagram and the uncertainty in the model fitting process .",
    "finally , the absorption located in the second quadrant is shown to be red - shifted with respect to the systematic velocity 58@xmath32 km s@xmath4 .",
