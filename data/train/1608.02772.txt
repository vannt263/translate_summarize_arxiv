    "since the seminal study of multi - band superconductors by suhl , matthias and walker @xcite it is known that the combination of either intra- and inter - band or of different types of interactions can lead to substantially enhanced superconducting transition temperatures @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "@xcite in addition to experimental studies there are recent theoretical predictions as to the enhancement of @xmath8 through fluctuations of the charge , orbital or spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the question is how one can demonstrate the influence of various pairing mechanisms and how ideas as to the realization of materials with higher @xmath8 values can be developed .",
    "it is obvious that a single spectroscopic method such as raman scattering can not pin down one or more routes to cooper pairing and disentangle their individual influence .",

    "in addition , light scattering affords a window into the fluctuations above various phase transitions @xcite which may contribute to the pairing in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "one essential advantage of light scattering is the existence of selection rules . beyond the well known selection rules for phonons or spin excitations",
    "one may discriminate between electronic excitations in different regions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xcite or project out excitations or critical fluctuations with characteristic wave vectors @xmath10 @xcite .    exploiting these selection rules several open issues in the iron - based compounds",

    "@xcite allow an estimate for @xmath139 yielding @xmath147 independent of doping .",
    "an impurity scattering rate of this magnitude is unrealistic since the pair - breaking feature below @xmath8 would be suppressed proportional to @xmath148 , with @xmath149 the energy gap , and would become unobservable @xcite ( see also next paragraph ) . for dynamical electron scattering , @xmath150 , the momentum can be carried away but there is no detailed theoretical study yet .",
    "independent of whether the scattering is elastic or inelastic the fluctuations and the e - h excitations can not be disentangled .",
    "several of these issues disappear if the fluctuations are analyzed in terms of al diagrams .",
    "in particular , as shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : bkfa](d ) and [ fig : bkfa_fluct](b ) both the e - h continuum and the fluctuations can be described with realistic parameters . in particular , the relaxation rate derived for the e - h continuum fits that obtained from the resistivity [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bkfa](d ) ] , and the quantities derived from the fluctuations are compatible with @xmath102 .",
    "although the spin dynamics is closely intertwined with charge fluctuations our analysis of the raman response in terms of the exchange of two spin fluctuations with momenta @xmath52 is supported by several arguments in particular in bfca and by neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the presently available data we therefore consider it more likely .",
    "the question as to the influence of fluctuations on cooper pairing is probably even more tantalizing than that on the phase transitions .",
    "around optimal doping a qcp was proposed to exist above which the fluctuations are particularly strong and can support cooper pairing @xcite . in this case the spectral weight in the @xmath7 pair breaking peak is predicted to increase along with @xmath8 if the doping decreases from the disordered side towards the qcp @xcite whereas the spectral weight in the other symmetries should exhibit little dependence on doping .",
    "[ fig : bfca ] displays the pair - breaking effect of bfca for @xmath19 including optimal doping at @xmath151 . in @xmath55 symmetry",
    "[ fig : bfca](k)(o ) ] we can not detect any differences between the normal and the superconducting state for reasons discussed earlier @xcite . in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 symmetry a gap and the pair - breaking effect can be observed . for quantifying the spectral weight we integrated the difference between the superconducting and the normal spectra between the intersection point and the high - energy limit of the measurements [ grey - shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfca](a)(j ) ] .",
    "the area is approximately four times larger in @xmath7 than in @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfca_sw ] , the doping dependences are similar and exhibit maxima at @xmath152 . what kind of explanation could be compatible with the findings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfca_sw ] ?     and @xmath7 symmetry as indicated .",
    "the spectral weight in @xmath6 symmetry is multiplied by 4 . ]",
    "an enhancement of the @xmath7 spectral weight close to optimal doping can originate in a contribution from fluctuations to cooper pairing .",
    "then a nematic resonance close to optimal doping can be expected since the fluctuations are strongest around a putative qcp close to the doping @xmath2 where the phase transition line @xmath153 approaches zero .",
    "gallais and coworkers @xcite argue that the spectral weight in @xmath7 symmetry peaks at the maximal @xmath8 right above the qcp . here , we observe that the variation of the spectral weight in @xmath6 symmetry has the same doping dependence as that in @xmath7 symmetry and propose an alternative scenario .",
    "there are two trends in bfca which can reduce the spectral weight independent of fluctuations : the opening of the sdw gap and impurities .",
    "( i ) for @xmath154 an sdw gap opens up .",
    "since it is most likely the result of fermi surface nesting it should open up on the electron and the hole bands as suggested by the observation of a redistribution of spectral weight in all symmetries .",
    "the opening of the sdw gap explains the reduction of spectral weight on the underdoped side in a natural way since parts of the fermi surfaces become gapped already above @xmath8 .",
    "( ii ) on the overdoped side the concentration of impurities in the fe planes becomes substantial and reduces the pair - breaking maxima being proportional to @xmath148 where @xmath155 is the impurity scattering time @xcite .",
    "in addition , a putative accidental node is lifted due to scattering between fermi surface parts with small and large gaps .",
    "possibly , indications of both effects of impurities are found in bfca at @xmath156 where the pair - breaking peak is reduced and a finite gap appears at low energies @xcite .",
    "this explanation does not support an interrelation between fluctuations and cooper pairing but is more compatible with the doping dependence of the spectral weights in @xmath7 and @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "we have presented light scattering results of bkfa in the normal state and bfca below @xmath8 . in underdoped bkfa ( @xmath5 )",
    "we find the response of critical spin fluctuations similar but not equal to that in bfca .",
    "the intensity in bkfa is weaker than in bfca and the critical exponent @xmath92 in the expression for the mass [ see eq .  ] depends strongly on doping .",
    "the residual mass at @xmath64 decreases with @xmath64 indicating a qcp on either side of zero doping .",
    "the temperature dependence of the fluctuation response is , by and large , consistent with the variation of the shear modulus @xmath79 .",
    "the problem arises which of the derived quantities , the first moment of the response , @xmath157 , the static relaxation rate , @xmath116 , or the initial slope of the fluctuation response , @xmath129 , should be used for the comparison with the thermodynamical data .",
    "we find that @xmath116 has the same temperature dependence as @xmath157 and describes @xmath79 best in addition to being available in absolute energy units .",
    "it is not clear at the moment as to why @xmath158 is inappropriate for describing @xmath79 .",
    "possibly the interaction between the fluctuations leads to an additional factor @xmath70 which appears only in the raman response .",
    "more work is needed here .    in the superconducting state of bfca",
    "we find a strong but similar doping dependence of the spectral weights of the pair - breaking maxima of both the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 spectra peaking at @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 response is not specifically enhanced as one would expect for an interrelation of nematic fluctuations and cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "one has to conclude that signatures of unconventional pairing channels in experimental probes remain rare and indirect such as the observation of a spin resonance @xcite and of a bardasis - schrieffer mode in optimally doped bkfa @xcite and possibly bfca indicating substantial attraction in the subleading @xmath159 channel on top of the @xmath160 ( or @xmath161 ) ground state .",
