    "except for a few mesons , like pions and kaons , most quark - antiquark states show up as resonances in systems of two or more mesons .",
    "it is thus opportune to study the interplay of meson - meson scattering and @xmath0 confinement @xcite .",
    "the mesonic resonances extracted from experiment are organized by flavor content , @xmath1 quantum numbers , mass , and width . from the few hundred listed in the pdg  tables @xcite",
    ", one would not yet conclude that they are abundant . nevertheless , based on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra , we concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that there must exist an infinity of such states , though cut off from observation at higher masses because of the many two - meson systems coupling to @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , we expect an infinity of scattering poles to show up in meson - meson scattering , here represented by @xmath4 unitarity then requires that in the one - channel restriction , assuming the poles ( [ polepositions ] ) to be simple poles , the elastic scattering matrix @xmath5 be given by @xmath6    if we assume that the resonances ( [ polepositions ] ) stem from an underlying confinement spectrum , given by the real quantities @xmath7 then we may represent the differences @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , 1 , 2 , @xmath10 , by @xmath11",
    ". thus , we obtain for the unitary @xmath5-matrix the expression @xmath12    so we assume here that resonances occur in scattering because the two - meson system couples to confined states , usually of the @xmath0 type , viz .  in non - exotic meson - meson scattering .",
    "let the strength of the coupling be given by @xmath13 . for vanishing @xmath13 , we presume that the widths and real shifts of the resonances also vanish",
    ". consequently , the scattering poles end up at the positions of the confinement spectrum  ( [ confinementpositions ] ) , and so @xmath14 as a result , the scattering matrix tends to unity , as expected in case there is no interaction .",
    "an obvious candidate for an expression of the form ( [ unitairsdeltae ] ) looks like @xmath15\\;\\left [ 1+\\lambda^{2}\\,\\left\\{{\\displaystyle \\sum_{n}^ { } } \\frac{\\textstyle g(e)}{\\textstyle e - e_{n}}\\right\\ } \\right]^{-1 } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{unitairsrse}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a smooth complex function of energy @xmath17 .",
    "in order to compare expression ( [ unitairsrse ] ) with results of experiment , we must choose a suitable complex function @xmath16 .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was further developed in refs .",
    "furthermore , values for the real spectrum ( [ confinementpositions ] ) must be chosen . in principle",
    ", one could fit @xmath18 ( @xmath9 , 1 , 2 , ... ) to experiment .",
    "but it is our experience that the spectrum listed in ref .",
    "@xcite is not yet rich enough to determine a suitable confinement spectrum . in refs .",
    "@xcite we proposed flavor masses and a universal level spacing @xmath19 for this purpose .",
    "the latter quantity can , with some confidence , be deduced from the @xmath3 and @xmath2 spectra , and also from the light positive - parity resonances @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath20 gev , corresponding to interquark distances ranging from 0.2 fm for @xmath2 to 0.6 fm for light quarks ..    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     our model is explicitly flavor independent , meaning that the only flavor breaking in formula  ( [ unitairsrse ] ) stems from the effective quark masses , which determine the ground state of the confinement spectrum ( [ confinementpositions ] ) , and from the masses of the mesons in the scattering channels .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 scattering is not very different from @xmath22 scattering in our model .",
    "we may expect then that each of the two flavor combinations that couple to isoscalar @xmath5-wave @xmath21 and @xmath23 scattering has a pole structure similar to the one in isodoublet @xmath22 scattering , with the proviso that @xmath24-@xmath25 mixing in the @xmath26 case introduces an extra complication @xcite .",
    "hence , since also @xmath27 is similar to @xmath22 in our model @xcite , with each pole of table  [ kpispoles ] we associate a full nonet of scalar mesons .",
    "the often read comment that _ too many isoscalar states are observed _",
    "@xcite , in order to justify the application of alternative quark , or even quarkless , configurations @xcite , is not confirmed here .",
    "in order to explain the difference between _ confinement _ and _ continuum _ poles ( see table  [ kpispoles ] ) , we turn to another member of the scalar - meson family , namely the heavy - light ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 meson @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath29 ends up below the threshold of the lowest ozi - allowed decay mode ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "consequently , it represents a bound state in this specific selection of decay channels @xcite , which we consider the most important .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath29 may be represented by a pole on the real energy axis .",
    "the pole representing the first radial excitation of the @xmath28 system in a relative @xmath31-wave comes out well above the @xmath30 threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two poles were found , one at 2.32 gev and a second at @xmath32 gev , representing the ground state and the first radial excitation of the @xmath33 @xmath28 system , respectively .",
    "experiment @xcite reported a @xmath28 structure at 2.86 gev , with the same line - shape as our theoretical prediction @xcite , and being compatible with @xmath33 quantum numbers .",
    "but in ref .",
    "@xcite an additional pole showed up in the scattering amplitude .",
    "its theoretical position was reported at @xmath34 gev .",
    "l    in fig .",
    "[ ds0poles ] we show the trajectories of the two lowest - lying poles in the scattering matrix for increasing @xmath28-@xmath30 coupling @xcite . the babar collaboration reported in ref .",

    "( [ unitairsdeltae ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ unitairsrse ] ) contains the physics outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : meson pairs with non - exotic quantum numbers couple to @xmath0 states through @xmath35 quark - pair annihilation / creation .",
    "this mechanism yields the resonances which we expected from the quark - antiquark confinement .",
    "but it also yields quasi - bound meson - meson molecules due to shielding caused by the quark - pair annihilation / creation . by",
    "model - reducing the intensity of the latter process , the associated poles move into the continuum and disappear from the spectrum of resonances in meson - meson scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ kpis ] ) .",
    "the low - lying scalar mesons belong to this set of resonances @xcite .",
    "the two trajectories shown in fig .",
    "[ ds0poles ] come close to each other for certain values of the @xmath28-@xmath30 coupling . upon a variation of one other model parameter ,",
    "this becomes a saddle point .",
    "depending on the value of this parameter , the trajectories may interchange . in that case",
    "the end points are connected differently , making the @xmath29 the dynamically generated state , whereas the other pole then seems to stem from the confinement ground state .",
    "this is actually what appears to happen for the light positive - parity ground - state mesons and makes them move up in energy when unquenching is turned on . for the scalar mesons , these states correspond to the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the dynamically generated poles correspond to the nonet of lower - lying scalar mesons @xcite .",
    "most probably , mesons are just mixtures @xcite of _ quark - antiquark _ states , _ two - meson molecules _ , _ glueballs _ , _ tetraquarks _ , _ hexaquarks _ , _ hybrids _ , and so forth .",
    "we have shown that the first two of the latter list of possible components are the most relevant ones @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a resonance is really a collection of states , all with different masses .",
    "each of these states will have a different composition .    in the spectrum of scattering poles for two - meson systems coupled to @xmath0 states , we find an infinity of resonances consisting of two distinguishable subsets .",
    "one subset manifests the phenomenon of @xmath0 confinement , whereas the other subset is a direct consequence of quark - pair annihilation / creation .",
    "the ground - state scalar nonet of confinement poles is formed by the nonet @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
