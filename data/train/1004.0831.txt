    "solar neutrinos offer a unique way to study the fusion processes in the center of our sun . the bulk of the released energy , about 98% , is converted into photons , that take about @xmath0 years to reach the solar surface .",
    "contrariwise , neutrinos released in solar fusion reactions ( sect.[secneupro ] ) leave the sun unimpeded , taking seconds to arrive at the solar surface and minutes for their travel to the earth .",
    "this free - streaming is based on the fact that neutrinos are only subject to weak nuclear forces , featuring typical interaction cross sections of 10@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the inherently low cross sections pose the main challenge to neutrino detection : in solar neutrino experiments , target masses of several tens or hundreds of tons are required to extract a meaningful signal .",
    "a variety of solar neutrino detectors has been devised since the late 1960s ( sect.[secneuexp ] ) : while in the early stages only integral measurements of the solar neutrino flux were possible , state - of - the - art detectors allow for a time and energy - resolved measurement .",
    "the most recent experiment to go into operation is borexino , a large - volume liquid - scintillator detector allowing the real - time detection of neutrinos in the sub - mev range ( sect.[secborex ] ) .",
    "the main concern of solar neutrino detection was for a long time to reveal the particle properties of the neutrino themselves .",
    "after the establishment of neutrino oscillations , experiments are now arriving at a stage at which information on the sun can be extracted from the measured neutrino spectrum .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that neutrinos could be used as indicators of the metallicity of the solar core , as helioseismological and spectroscopic evidence is incongruent ( sect.[secsolmet ] ) .",
    "while the available neutrino data is for the moment inconclusive , refinements of the measurements of current experiments might improve the situation .",
    "moreover , future experiments like the sno+ and lena detectors will further improve the precision of the solar neutrino measurement . sect.[secfutexp ] will highlight the range of open questions in particle and solar physics that these experiments will be able to answer .",
    "the sun is one of the strongest natural neutrino sources on earth , producing a flux of 6.6@xmath310@xmath4 per @xmath5s @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are generated as a byproduct of the fusion processes fueling the solar energy production , mainly by the proton - proton ( pp ) fusion chain , but to a small extent ( 1 - 2% ) also by the catalytic cno cycle .",
    "the net reaction of both processes is @xmath6 two neutrinos are generated per completed @xmath7he fusion .    inside the pp chain ,",
    "most of the neutrinos are generated in the basic fusion reaction of two protons to one deuteron ( compare fig.[figppchain ] ) .",
    "these so - called pp neutrinos appear at low energies in the solar neutrino spectrum depicted in fig.[figsolspe ] , the maximum neutrino energy limited to 420kev .",
    "however , side branches of the pp chain allow for the production of neutrinos at higher energies . depending on the reaction kinematics , the resulting neutrinos",
    "can either be distributed over a broad spectral range ( in case of a three - particle final state ) , or are produced at fixed energy ( if there are only two particles involved ) .",
    "the corresponding neutrinos are called after their production reaction ; the line energies or spectral endpoint , respectively , are listed in table[tabneuene ] .",
    ", the so - called pp neutrino . while the pp - ii chain produces a monoenergetic neutrino by the electron - induced conversion of a @xmath8be to a @xmath8li nucleus , in the pp - iii chain high - energetic neutrinos are released by the decay of a @xmath9b nucleus.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    .energy and predicted flux for the solar neutrinos produced along the @xmath10 chain and the cno cycle .",
    "the fluxes are derived assuming high ( gs ) and low ( ags ) solar metallicity .",
    "relative uncertainties are given in brackets .",
    "the last column shows the relative difference @xmath11 in flux predictions .",
    "the fluxes are presented in units of @xmath12 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath13 ( @xmath8be ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16n , @xmath17o ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath9b , @xmath19f ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22s@xmath23 @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabneuflu ]    the current status is presented in table[tabneuflu ] : up to now , merely the fluxes of @xmath24be-@xmath25 s and @xmath26b-@xmath25 s were directly determined by liquid - scintillator and water cherenkov detectors , respectively @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the neutrino flux predictions based on the most recent ssm calculations are presented in which the solar metallicity enters as input parameter : the column bps08(gs ) denotes the fluxes corresponding to the older high values for metallicity , while bps08(ags ) corresponds to the lower values of the new analysis @xcite .",
    "values in brackets represent the relative uncertainties ( 1@xmath27 ) .",
    "neither the accuracies of the experimental results nor of the ssm predictions are for the moment sufficient to allow a definite conclusion .",
    "while the borexino result for the @xmath24be-@xmath25 flux slightly favors the higher metallicity values , the @xmath26b result lies between the two ssm predictions .",
    "however , improvement is expected on both sides : an analysis of the error budgets of the ssm neutrino fluxes reveals that especially the precision on the @xmath26b-@xmath25 flux could be increased by a more accurate determination of the solar iron and carbon abundances and of the nuclear cross section @xmath28 . at the same time , this would greatly decrease the uncertainty for the cno-@xmath25 flux .",
    "the impact on the currently best - determined @xmath24be-@xmath25 flux would be low @xcite .    from the experimental side ,",
    "no large improvement is expected for the @xmath26b-@xmath25 flux measurements in present detectors . while the sno experiment was terminated",
    ", super - kamiokande results are for the moment dominated by systematical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a new analysis of the third phase of the experiment from aug 2006 to aug 2008 aims on reducing the systematic effects @xcite .",
    "the present uncertainty of the @xmath24be-@xmath25 flux as determined in borexino is about 12% @xcite . a new analysis based on a considerably larger data set",
    "is planned for 2010 . moreover ,",
    "a calibration campaign using radioactive sources placed inside the detection volume was conducted in early 2009 .",
    "the results will be used to decrease the systematic uncertainties introduced by the detector response function , i.e.mainly the energy calibration , and by the position reconstruction .",
    "the latter is necessary to precisely determine the target mass used for analysis .",
    "an overall precision of better than 5% on the flux measurement is envisaged .",
    "borexino might also contribute in a further way : in the 2008 analysis shown in fig.[figbe7spe ] , the radioactive background @xmath29bi and the spectral contribution of the cno-@xmath25 s is fitted by the same function @xcite .",
    "this simplification is valid in the range of the @xmath24be-@xmath25 shoulder at 660kev where the spectral differences are small .",
    "however , the endpoint of the @xmath29bi @xmath30-decay is at 1.16mev , while the spectra of some of the cno-@xmath25 s reach up to 1.7mev .",
    "also the compton - like shoulder caused by the monoenergetic pep-@xmath25 s should show up in this regime of the electron recoil spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the background created by @xmath31c @xmath32 decays dominates the neutrino signal between 1 and 2mev by about an order of magnitude .",
    "currently , efforts are made to suppress this background using the signature of the production mechanism : @xmath31c is a cosmogenic isotope created by cosmic muons crossing the target volume , knocking out a single neutron from a @xmath33c nucleus present in the organic liquid . the most promising approach is a veto using both the spatial and time information of the parent muon track , the capture of the knock - out neutron on a hydrogen nucleus that is visible in liquid - scintillator , and the decay of the @xmath31c nucleus itself @xcite . at the moment , both improvements in the reconstruction software as well as in the daq hardware are on - going to reach the rejection efficiency of about 90 to 95% that is required to resolve the spectral contributions of residual @xmath31c background , cno-@xmath25 s and pep-@xmath25 s .",
    "even if the level of cosmogenic background in borexino proves to be too large for an actual measurement of the cno and pep neutrino fluxes , the best limits on their spectral contributions will significantly be improved .",
    "however , the currently upcoming sno+ experiment will be in a much better position to measure these contributions : based on the setup of the terminated sno experiment , the acrylic vessel formerly holding the heavy water target will be refilled with liquid scintillator .",
    "the resulting target mass will be three times larger than in borexino .",
    "more importantly , sno+ will be located at a depth corresponding to 6000mwe in the creighton mine at sudbury , the additional shielding reducing the residual muon flux by about 2 orders of magnitude compared to the borexino site .",
    "therefore , the background of cosmogenic @xmath31c will play a minor role in sno+ , the achievable accuracy mainly depending on the radiopurity of the liquid scintillator and the detector materials .",
    "further in the future , the lena ( low energy neutrino astronomy ) experiment is planned to go into operation in 2020 @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in fig.[figlendet ] . with a target of 50 kilotons of liquid scintillator",
    ", lena will be an observatory for a variety of terrestrial and astrophysical neutrino sources : about 15000 neutrino events are expected in case of a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) at the center of our galaxy , giving insights into the nuclear processes leading to the collapse of the stellar core region and the subsequent neutrino cooling of the proto - neutron star @xcite . even in the absence of a galactic sn , the faint neutrino flux generated by extra - galactic",
    "sne offers a possibility to obtain information both on the star formation rate and the sn neutrino spectrum .",
    "while the event rates caused by this diffuse sn neutrino background are too low to be discovered in present - day detectors , the sensitivity of lena will be sufficient to identify about 10 events per year @xcite .",
    "also the chemical composition and heat production of our own planet can be investigated by a precision measurement of geoneutrinos @xcite : these neutrinos are produced by the radioactive elements of the natural uranium and thorium decay chains that are embedded in the earth s crust and mantle .",
    "regarding the spectroscopy of solar neutrinos , a new era of precision measurements will begin : based on a fiducial volume of 20kt , rates of several hundred events per day are expected for cno , pep and @xmath9b @xmath25 s in lena , allowing a precise determination of their relative contributions to the solar neutrino spectrum @xcite . as lena will be placed at greater depth than borexino ( albeit not as deep as sno+ )",
    ", cosmogenic background levels will be significantly lower .",
    "most remarkable is probably the daily rate of 10000 @xmath8be-@xmath25 events per day : these statistics would allow to search for modulations in the neutrino flux on a per mill level .",
    "such modulations could be induced by the interaction of the propagating neutrinos with solar or terrestrial matter @xcite , or by periodical changes in the neutrino production rate itself .",
    "the range of interest reaches from periods of tens of minutes typical for helioseismic g - modes to the scale of decades correlated to the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "in the last 20 years , the spectroscopy of solar neutrinos has greatly enhanced our knowledge of neutrino particle parameters , but has also confirmed the elaborate models describing the solar energy production by fusion in the pp - chain and the cno cycle . while the currently available data on solar neutrino fluxes is not accurate enough to resolve the conflict in the determination of solar metallicity , a considerable improvement in the near future can be expected .    up to now ,",
    "only @xmath8be and @xmath9b neutrino fluxes have spectroscopically been measured .",
    "however , there is a good chance that the contributions of pep and cno neutrinos will be discovered either in the currently running borexino detector or in the upcoming sno+ experiment . in 10 years from now ,",
    "a large liquid - scintillator based neutrino observatory like lena might allow precision measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum , possibly revealing time variations in the solar energy production .",
    "for sure , the next years will deepen both our understanding of neutrinos as well as of their sources .",
