    "the nature of the second parameter , aside from metallicity , which determines the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) in globular clusters ( gcs ) , is one of the most longstanding problems of modern astrophysics .",
    "in fact , a lower metallicity favors the formation of hotter and bluer hb stars , but clusters with the same metallicity can show very different hb morphology @xcite , and an hb extended far toward the blue is observed even in some metal - rich gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the helium abundance has been early proposed , among others , as this second parameter ( @xcite ; see @xcite , for a review ) because , during the he - burning phase , helium - rich stars are expected to be hotter than objects of canonical composition .",
    "this model has recently drawn much attention , triggered by the discovery of multiple stellar populations in gcs @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that a different metallicity is not the cause of the main - sequence split observed in @xmath0centauri @xcite , and the only explanation is that the bluer sequence is greatly enriched in helium , about 50% more he - rich ( y=0.38 ) than in normal metal - poor gc stars @xcite . in this scenario , the blue hb stars observed in many gcs could be the progeny of the he - enriched second stellar generation .",
    "unfortunately , diffusion processes completely alter the surface chemical abundances of hot hb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , preventing a direct demonstration of the connection between multiple populations and hb morphology .",
    "nevertheless , an increased helium content can be indirectly deduced from other observable quantities , because he - enriched hb stars are predicted to be brighter @xcite and to occupy different loci in the temperature  gravity plane @xcite .    in this letter , we present the results of our investigation aimed to search for an indirect indication of helium enrichment among blue hb stars in @xmath0centauri , to test the he - enrichment scenario and its predicted effects on the hb morphology .",
    "this cluster is the ideal target for our purpose , because it hosts a very complex stellar population , comprising three known mss and six sub - giant branches @xcite .",
    "we selected 116 target stars from the ground - based photometry of @xcite .",
    "they span a wide portion of the cluster hb , from the blue edge of the rr lyrae gap to the blue hook objects ( t@xmath1 33000  k ) 5 mag fainter . in this letter",
    ", we will focus on the comparison of @xmath0cen stars with other clusters and theoretical models .",
    "we therefore limit the analysis to t@xmath233000  k , because hotter blue hook stars are not included in the canonical models and are not present in the comparison clusters .",
    "a full analysis of the results , including the blue hook , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the data were collected at paranal observatory in service mode between 2006 january and april , with fors2@ut1 in mxu mode .",
    "the selected 600b grism , coupled with 0@xmath35-wide slits , gave spectra of resolution r@xmath4 from the atmospheric cutoff to approximately 5900 .",
    "three 45 minute spectra for faint stars and two 45 minute spectra for bright ones were acquired .",
    "data were reduced with the fors pipeline[multiblock footnote omitted ] , and the spectra were extracted under iraf[multiblock footnote omitted ] , subtracting the nearby sky spectrum within the same slit .",
    "finally , the spectrum of the standard star ltt4816 @xcite , secured during observations , was used to flux - calibrate the object spectra , whose resulting signal - to - noise ratio was between 50 and 150 .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities ( rv ) were measured with the iraf _ fxcor _ task , cross - correlating @xcite the spectra with synthetic templates of adequate parameters as estimated from the stellar position in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "considering the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster ( @xmath513kms@xmath6 , @xcite ) and the errors of measurements ( about 30  km  s@xmath6 ) , the rv of all the observed stars is consistent with cluster membership .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of target stars were measured fitting the observed balmer and helium lines with stellar model atmospheres , computed with atlas9 @xcite .",
    "we used lemke s version[multiblock footnote omitted ] of the linfor program ( developed originally by holweger , steffen , and steenbock at kiel university ) to compute a grid of synthetic spectra .",
    "stars showing iron lines in the 44504600   region , indicating active atmospheric diffusion @xcite , or being hotter than 13000  k ( as deduced from the position in the cmd ) , were fitted with metal - rich models ( [ m / h]=+0.5 ) with varying surface helium abundance , to account for the effects of radiative levitation of heavy elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this was done even for five stars hotter than 11500  k not satisfying these criteria , because the observed helium lines were clearly too weak compared to the fitted models when diffusion was not taken into account .",
    "the cooler stars were fitted with cluster - metallicity models ( [ m / h]=@xmath71.5 ) with helium abundance fixed at the solar value , because their he lines are very weak and not observed at our resolution . in a few cases of doubt about the correct model to use , we adopted the set of model spectra that returned the lower @xmath8 of the fit .",
    "the best fit to the observed spectra was obtained by means of the routines developed by @xcite and @xcite , as modified by @xcite , which employ a @xmath8 test .",
    "the spectral lines used in the procedure included the balmer series from h@xmath9 to h@xmath10 , except for h@xmath11 to avoid the blended caii  h line , four hei lines ( 4026  , 4388  , 4471  , and 4921  ) for stars whose helium abundance was not kept fixed , and the heii lines 4542   and 4686   when visible in the spectra of the hottest stars .",
    "the routines estimate the errors on the derived parameters from the @xmath8 of the fit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but neglect all other sources of errors ( e.g. , defects in normalization , flat - field correction , sky subtraction ) .",
    "we therefore obtained a better estimate of the true errors multiplying the output values by 3 ( r. napiwotzki , private communication ) .",
    "stellar masses were calculated from the measured temperatures and gravities , through the relation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 we assumed t@xmath14=5777 k , @xmath15=4.44 , ( m - m)@xmath16=13.75@xmath170.13 @xcite , and e(@xmath18)=0.12@xmath170.01 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* december web version ) .",
    "the bolometric correction ( bc ) was derived from effective temperatures through the empirical calibration of @xcite .",
    "errors on masses were derived from propagation of errors .",
    "our results are plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ f_tg ] , where we show the position of the program stars in the temperature - gravity space , superimposed to the theoretical zero - age and terminal - age hb ( zahb and tahb , respectively ) from @xcite , for canonical ( y=0.23 ) and he - enriched ( y=0.33 ) models . in the same figure",
    "we include 78 stars from @xcite , who measured the atmospheric parameters with the same procedure as in the present work , but based on medium - resolution flames spectra , and a different set of model spectra for stars above 20000  k. the two sets of data behave very similarly in the t@xmath19-@xmath20 plane .",
    "the comparison of the eight stars in common confirms the good agreement between the two works : the mean difference in gravity is null ( @xmath21 dex ) , while the difference in temperature is small ( 155  k ) , and becomes negligible ( 25  k ) after the exclusion of two stars with very large errors ( @xmath221500  k ) .",
    "our mass estimates are on average higher by 0.035 m@xmath23 , an offset accounted for by the fainter magnitudes ( 0.09 mag the mean difference ) from the @xcite catalog used by moehler et al . given the excellent agreement , we will merge the two datasets together .",
    "the surface gravity of stars cooler than @xmath518000  k is systematically lower by about 0.2 - 0.3 dex with respect to canonical models , while they closely follow the trend of he - enhanced models at all temperatures . in the lower panel of figure  [ f_tg ]",
    "we compare these results with similar measurements obtained in three gcs , namely ngc6752 @xcite , m80 and ngc5986 @xcite .",
    "we adopt as vertical coordinate the difference between the measured @xmath20 and the value of the canonical zahb at the corresponding temperature .",
    "the comparison reveals that the hb stars in @xmath0cen and in the other gcs behave very differently .",
    "we note that the stars of the comparison clusters do not completely agree with canonical models , whose expectation is to find the majority of the objects next to the zahb , and not to the tahb as observed .",
    "even so , @xmath0cen stars clearly show lower gravities  at a given effective temperature  with respect to stars in other gcs .",
    "observational errors tend to mask the general trend , but there is an offset of 0.15 dex at the cooler end , which decreases at higher temperatures and fades out around 18000  k , to reappear even larger ( @xmath220.2 dex ) among hot stars at 25000 - 28000  k. however , we find a problem in the estimate of stellar masses , summarized in the upper panel of figure  [ f_masabs ] : while the results in the comparison clusters roughly agree with expectations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete discussion ) , the masses of @xmath0cen stars are constantly underestimated at all temperatures .",
    "interestingly enough , @xcite found very similar results for hb stars in ngc6388 .",
    "this is a very peculiar cluster , as it has an extended , blue hb @xcite despite its high metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath70.6 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of an extreme he - enrichment ( up to y=0.40 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as in the case of its twin cluster , ngc6441 . while @xcite cast doubts on their results due to the large uncertainties caused by stellar crowding in this compact , bulge cluster , these results are very similar to what we find now in @xmath0cen .",
    "in the temperature - gravity plane , the @xmath0cen hb stars match the expectations of he - enriched models rather than canonical ones .",
    "however , the resulting underestimate of their mass prevents us from straightforwardly concluding that this is evidence of helium enrichment .",
    "in fact , the progenies of he - rich stars in the hb phase should not be noticeably less massive than stars of canonical composition @xcite , and the difference at any temperature is expected to be tiny ( @xmath240.03  m@xmath23 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the derived masses are on average well below the value required to ignite helium in the core ( @xmath50.45  m@xmath23 ) .",
    "the easiest interpretation of our observations is the presence of a systematic error , biasing the results toward lower gravities and , as a consequence , lower masses .",
    "however , in this work we used the same instrument , software , and models as @xcite , finding a clear difference between @xmath0cen and the other clusters , while our measurements well agree with @xcite , who also investigated @xmath0cen but with a different instrument , higher resolution , different models for stars hotter than 20000  k , and only a subset of balmer lines . therefore , even if we can not completely exclude an observational bias with respect to theoretical expectations , the difference between @xmath0cen and the three comparison clusters must be real : _ hb stars in @xmath0cen are intrinsically different to their analogs in other gcs_. the same conclusion can be drawn even if the offset is a product of the inadequacy of the employed models : in this case , they would be reproducing sufficiently well the atmospheric structure of the hb objects in the comparison clusters , but not in @xmath0cen , hence a physical difference would be present .",
    "the observed trends can not be due to a wrong ( hotter ) temperature scale .",
    "in fact , for each star we translated the measured temperature in a reddening estimate , comparing the observed ( @xmath18 ) color to the theoretical value obtained interpolating the @xcite grid , for the same metallicities as the model spectra used in the fits .",
    "the average value is e(@xmath18)=0.114 , in perfect agreement with the literature , and with no significant trend along the hb .",
    "a temperature scale hotter by 10% ( 5% ) would have caused an overestimate of reddening by 0.04 ( 0.02 ) mag at 10000  k. in figure  [ f_spec ] we compare the h@xmath9 line profiles of two stars with similar temperature in m80 and @xmath0cen : the line core and depth are very similar , indicating no noticeably difference in temperature , but the star in m80 , whose measured gravity is 0.40  dex higher , shows wider wings .",
    "this comparison indicates that the peculiar stellar gravities reflect a real difference in the spectra of the target stars .",
    "we are aware that some stellar parameters unaccounted for in our study , such as stellar wind and rotation , can cause wider line wings mimicking a difference in gravity , and this degeneracy can not be avoided at our resolution .",
    "the underestimate of gravities can also be caused by the stratification of elemental abundances due to diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic difference in one of these parameters , affecting @xmath0cen but not the other clusters , would be even more puzzling , and it is harder to postulate at this stage .",
    "it must also be noted that the mass underestimate does not completely follow the trend of the difference in gravity : while this seems to vary with temperature as noted before , the masses in @xmath0cen are constantly underestimated by @xmath50.15 m@xmath23 for t@xmath110000  k. for example , at t@xmath2516000 - 18000  k there is a clear offset in masses , but not in gravities .",
    "this indicates that low gravities may play a role , but at least another effect should be at work , causing the observed mass underestimate .",
    "all the comparison clusters have similar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath261.5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xmath0cen shows a large spread up to [ fe / h]=@xmath70.6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". nevertheless , it is unlikely that the higher metallicity is the origin of the peculiar results in @xmath0cen : the largest differences are found for stars hotter than @xmath511500  k , whose surface abundances are altered by diffusion processes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that , in the presence of diffusion , the surface abundance patterns are very similar in clusters of very different initial metallicity .",
    "the stars in all the clusters should therefore show the same behavior independently of their primordial metal content , especially at 15000 - 16000  k where diffusion reaches its maximum strength @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found no peculiarity in the measured gravity and mass of two stars in 47tuc ( [ fe / h]=@xmath70.7 ) , although using low - metallicity models .",
    "we repeated the measurements assuming different values of the model metallicity , to test how this parameter can affect the results .",
    "we found small differences in the stellar parameters , but the general behavior was unaltered : a higher model metallicity indeed returned slightly higher gravities , but higher temperatures too .",
    "as a consequence , the points were shifted almost parallel to the theoretical tracks in the t@xmath19-@xmath20 plane , while the masses were increased by less than 0.05  m@xmath23 .",
    "the blanketing effect should be lower in metal - poor stars than in the solar - metallicity stars used to calibrate the adopted t@xmath19-bc relation , and this could cause the underestimate of the bc and of the mass .",
    "the adopted bc should be a good approximation for the stars hotter than the grundahl jump @xcite , because radiative levitation increases their surface abundances to super - solar values .",
    "as already noted , the effect should be independent of their primordial metallicity , thus the bc does not explain the offset of @xmath0cen with respect to the other gcs . at cooler temperatures ,",
    "the offset could be explained by the bc if @xmath0cen stars were more metal - poor than in the other gcs , thus decreasing their bc by @xmath50.4 mag .",
    "indeed , @xmath0cen hosts a metal - poor sub - population at [ fe / h]=@xmath72 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the bc varies by less than 0.15  mag for stars at 8000 - 10000  k in the whole range between solar metallicity and [ fe / h]=@xmath72 @xcite . a wrong distance modulus or reddening could also cause wrong mass estimates , but the required correction to increase the masses by 0.1  m@xmath23 is huge ( @xmath220.4 mag in distance modulus , @xmath220.13 mag in reddening ) .",
    "the recent literature estimates agree on these quantities within 0.1 and 0.01 mag , respectively , allowing only negligible variations of the mass estimates .",
    "even an offset in the photometric zero - point could cause the observed offset , but comparing the @xmath27 mag of @xcite with the values of @xcite and @xcite we found only a small difference ( @xmath240.1 mag ) in the direction opposite to that required , with the magnitudes used here being brighter than in the other catalogs . in conclusion , none of the photometric parameters ( stellar magnitude , bc , distance modulus , and reddening ) entering in the calculation of the stellar mass through equation  ( [ eqmass2 ] ) offers a viable explanation of our results .",
    "he - enriched hb stars are expected to be brighter than analogous objects of canonical composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the increased luminosity should balance the lower gravities in equation  ( [ eqmass1 ] ) , returning a similar mass .",
    "all other parameters being the same , m@xmath28 should be brighter by 0.25 - 0.38 mag to compensate a decrease of 0.10 - 0.15 dex in gravity . on the contrary , in the lower panel of figure  [ f_masabs ]",
    "the perfect match between the absolute magnitudes of the hb of @xmath0cen and the other clusters is clear .",
    "the too low values obtained for the stellar masses could therefore also be interpreted as due to the lack of increased flux , instead of too low gravity estimates .",
    "it could be argued that he - enriched stars could not necessarily be brighter in the @xmath27 band , because the bolometric luminosity is the quantity entering in equation  ( [ eqmass1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of he - enriched and canonical stars is required to properly deduce their luminosity from the @xmath27 magnitude through equation  ( [ eqmass2 ] ) .",
    "however , great differences are not expected for stars hotter than 12000  k , because the diffusion processes decrease the atmospheric he - abundance well below solar values in both cases .",
    "in fact , we find no difference in surface helium abundance between @xmath0cen and the other clusters , and @xmath291.5 for all the stars . with atmospheres of very similar chemical composition ,",
    "their sed should not be very different , and even the known uv - enhanced flux of these stars @xcite should have the same effects irrespective of the primordial helium content .",
    "blue hb stars in @xmath0cen show lower gravities with respect to both canonical models and analogous stars in other gcs , but their stellar masses are underestimated , and their visual absolute magnitudes are very similar to those of the comparison clusters .",
    "neither the low gravities nor the other parameters involved in the calculation can explain the too low masses .",
    "we can firmly conclude that these results reveal an intrinsic difference between the blue hb stars in @xmath0cen and their analogs in other gcs , but its interpretation is not straightforward .",
    "the lower gravities follow the expectations for he - rich stars , but the magnitudes and masses do not .",
