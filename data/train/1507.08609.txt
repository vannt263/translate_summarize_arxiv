    "the biaxial nematic phase ( @xmath0 ) of liquid crystals ( lc ) , predicted theoretically very early @xcite , and realised experimentally in the past decade , in bent - core @xcite , tetrapode @xcite , and polymeric @xcite systems , is characterised by a primary director @xmath1 and a secondary director @xmath2 ( perpendicular to @xmath1 ) .",
    "field - induced switching of the secondary director is envisaged to be faster than the primary director in the biaxial nematic phase , a fact which endows these nematics with a promising potential for use in fast switching electro - optic devices @xcite . the orthorhombic @xmath0 phases with @xmath3 symmetry",
    "are suggested to be desirable @xcite for ready applications .    while the current experimental studies are still concerned with unambiguous confirmation of macroscopic biaxiality @xcite , computer simulations @xcite on the other hand have been playing a significant role in the investigation of biaxial systems .",
    "a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of the bulk biaxial gay - berne fluid under the action of an electric field @xcite has convincingly shown that the switching of the secondary director is an order of magnitude faster than the switching of the primary director .    in the biaxial nematic phase ,",
    "a different pathway for fast switching between different birefringent states ( compared to conventional uniaxial lc systems ) is possible because the birefringence can be changed by a rotation of the short axes which are thermally ordered , while the orientation of the long axes could be kept fixed @xcite .",
    "a possible device configuration to achieve this objective is to use a film of biaxial liquid crystal confined in a planar cell with hybrid boundary conditions , wherein the geometry could constrain the orientation of the primary director ( of the long axes ) in the biaxial nematic phase , leaving the secondary director ( of one of the short axes ) free for switching with an appropriate ( in - plane ) field .",
    "studies on uniaxial hybrid films have established @xcite that a bent - director configuration could be realised if the film thickness is greater than a critical thickness determined by the curvature elasticity of the medium and the surface interaction strength .",
    "preliminary work on their biaxial counterpart was also carried out earlier @xcite .    in this context , we investigated the equilibrium director structures in two planar films of biaxial liquid crystals , in the uniaxial and biaxial phases of the medium .",
    "the anchoring influences of the two substrates comprising the cell are used to pin the orientation of the primary director ( ordering direction of the major ( long ) axes of the molecules ) near the two surfaces so as to result in a bent - director hybrid structure .",
    "the substrates can be chosen either not to have influence on the minor axes of the molecules ( pure uniaxial coupling with the substrate , say type - a film ) , or to couple with the minor axes as well ( biaxial coupling with the substrate , say type - b film ) .",
    "we simulated director structures in both these films based on markov chain monte carlo ( mc ) sampling technique , constructing corresponding equilibrium ensembles .",
    "this paper reports our results , examining the role of biaxial anchoring on the orientational ordering in the medium , and looking for their suitability to utilize the secondary director for possible switching applications .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the lattice model of the medium , and details of the anchoring conditions of the two films .",
    "the mc simulation are also discussed in this section .",
    "the equilibrium director structures of the film in the two nematic phases obtained from the computations are depicted and discussed in section iii .",
    "we also examine the effect of varying the cell thickness , as well as of the relative anchoring strengths at the two substrates on the director structures in these films .",
    "the last section summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we consider a planar hybrid film comprising of lc molecules with @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "we assign the right - handed triad @xmath4 to represent the laboratory - fixed frame and @xmath5 to represent the molecular - fixed frame .",
    "we let @xmath6 direction represent the molecular long axis , while the other two ( minor ) axes are represented by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the film is obtained by confining the biaxial molecules between two planar substrates taken to be in the x - y plane .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the schematics of a biaxial molecule , orienting influences at the two substrates of the planar film , and the reference axes of the laboratory .",
    "the orientational interactions between lc molecules , relevant to the present study , are conveniently accounted for , by adopting a lattice hamiltonian model wherein the molecules are located at the lattice sites represented by unit vectors @xmath9 specifying the individual molecular orientations . within this lattice description , in a film of thickness @xmath10 the substrate planes are positioned at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( lattice units ) .",
    "the influence of the substrates is simulated by introducing two bounding layers of molecules contained in these planes with the designated , but fixed , orientations , referred to in the literature as ghost molecules @xcite .        the anchoring conditions in both the films are such that the long axes of the molecules are hybrid - aligned ( planar orientation parallel to say , @xmath13-axis at one substrate and homeotropic at the other , parallel to @xmath14-axis ) .",
    "for adequately thick films , the primary director @xmath1 is bent satisfying the two incompatible boundary conditions .",
    "we distinguish two scenarios : ( a ) in type - a film , the ghost molecules interact with the lc molecules in the surface layer anchoring only their long axes , thus implying that the substrate hosts only cylindrical symmetric rod - like lc constituents , and ( b ) in type - b film the ghost molecules themselves have @xmath3 symmetry and interact through a hamiltonian model appropriate to the biaxial system .",
    ", these correspond to two qualitatively distinct chemical treatments of the anchoring substrates .    in type",
    "- a film , the molecular @xmath6-axes are anchored along the z - direction in the surface layer near , say , lower substrate of the cell ( k=1 ) , while they are kept planar ( say , parallel to y - axis ) in other surface layer , near the substrate ( k=@xmath15 ) . as the substrates do not interact with the minor axes of the molecules in this film , they are not , @xmath16 , oriented in any specific direction , until guided by equilibrium conditions under a given interaction model .    in the type - b film",

    "periodic boundary conditions are applied along the laboratory x and y directions , so as to minimize finite size effects .",
    "the anchoring conditions applied at the two substrates ( contained in the x - y plane ) depend on the specific choice of the film ( type a or b ) , and their relative strengths are chosen as desired .",
    "we index the lc layers with @xmath38 , starting from the substrate imposing homeotropic anchoring influence on the long molecular axes .",

    "the variation also shows that the middle layers ( @xmath38 = 4 and 5 ) , being the least influenced by the substrate boundaries , are most effective in contributing to the critical onset of the order at the transition .",

    "it appears that the layer - wise magnitudes of the two dominant orders are relatively stable , but their orientations are not .",
    "we now discuss the evolution of the uniaxial sample order @xmath67 in the two films as the system transits through the two transitions , specifically in comparison with the layerwise behaviour ( figs .",
    "[ fig:5a ] , [ fig:8a ] ) .",
    "focussing on type - a film initially , we note that the sharp increase in this order at the second @xmath53 transition is unlike the variation in the bulk sample(fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , and is not supported by its layer - wise variations .",
    "the latter are smoothly varying across the transition , and the director angles @xmath68 also do not betray the presence of an intermediate phase transition . and",
    "yet , the bulk order of the film , defined and computed as corresponding to the maximum eigen value of the ordering tensors of the three molecular axes , is very sensitive to this transition .",
    "the case of the type - b film is qualitatively the same , but for the onset of significant fluctuations in the @xmath0 phase at @xmath56 .",
    "this points to the need to further investigate this system in terms of thermal variations of the eigen values of the three axes separately and examine their behavior across this transition .",
    "accordingly , we computed equilibrated averages ( over the film ) of the maximum eigen values ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) of the ordering tensors ( @xmath72 ) of the three molecular axes and depict their variation for the case of type - a film in fig .  [ fig:9a ] .",
    "we also show the directions ( @xmath73 ) of the corresponding three eigen vectors , as a function of mc steps after equilibration , in the @xmath0 phase , in fig .",
    "[ fig:9b ] . from these two figures ,",
    "it is evident that the onset of the biaxial phase in this confined system ( at @xmath56=0.5 ) leads to a sudden change in the direction of dominant order of the film itself .",
    "while the alignment of the long molecular axes defines the primary director till @xmath56 , it is the molecular @xmath7 axes which are the most ordered among the three , below this temperature .",
    "in conjunction with fig .  [ fig:9b ] , we see that the ordering direction of this calamitic axis is indeed in the laboratory x - direction in the biaxial phase , while the other two eigen vectors are confined to the laboratory yz plane , mutually perpendicular to each other .",
    "it may be noted that the onset of a biaxial phase thus leads to maximal ordering of the second major axes , wholly contained in the plane of the substrate , and the anchoring conditions imposed in this case constrain only the long axes of the lc molecules , along with the minor @xmath74-axes of the molecules .",
    "in contrast , type - b film which imposes anchoring restrictions on the minor axes of molecules as well at both the ends , presents a very different scenario .",
    "we refer to fig .",

    "eigen vector of @xmath71 makes an angle @xmath80 with the laboratory z - direction and @xmath81 with laboratory x - direction , thereby indicating that the bent - director structure originating from the ordering of the molecular @xmath6-axes is contained in the yz plane , as is also the case in the high temperature nematic phase .",
    "curiously the eigen vector of @xmath70 is oriented at angles @xmath80 and with a fluctuating @xmath50 varying between @xmath82 to @xmath83 ( see fig .  [ fig:10b ] ) .",
    "the maximal ordering direction in this film is determined by the ordering tensor of the molecular @xmath8-axes and its azimuthal angle @xmath50 is eventually contained in the plane of the substrate pointing to the laboratory x - direction .",
    "it may be noted that the corresponding fluctuations of the azimuthal angle @xmath50 of the local directors of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 molecular axes are complementary ( fig .  [ fig:10b ] ) .",
    "it is thus obvious that the observed significant noise in the thermal averages of @xmath45 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 at the onset of the @xmath0 phase arises due to the fluctuations in the directions of the different ordering tensors ( figs .",
    "[ fig:7a ] and [ fig:7b ] .",
    "the relative stability observed in the case of @xmath48 ( in the @xmath0 phase ) perhaps follows from the interesting circumstance that the biaxial order in this film is defined by the ordering of the molecular @xmath7 and @xmath6 axes ; while the ordering direction of the @xmath6 axes is fairly stable , that of @xmath7 axes fluctuates however complementary to the primary director defined by the molecular @xmath8 axes .",
    "the qualitatively different scenario of the type - b film , relative to type - a , arises due to the imposition of additional restrictions on all the molecular axes at the two substrates .    comparing the two films in their biaxial phase",

    "however , imposition of anchoring constraints on all molecular axes leaves the second film frustrated , leading to significant fluctuations of the ordering directions .",
    "moreover from a practical point of view , it is much easier to prepare substrates which need to restrain only one type of axes of the system .",
    "thus type - a lends itself as a possible structure containing stable and significant order contained within the plane of the film ( and hence can be unambiguously coupled to an in - plane external field ) , with the added convenience in the preparation of required substrates .",

    "two different films were considered : type - a in which only the long axes are anchored at the substrates and type - b in which all molecular axes are suitably anchored . very interestingly , type - a film leads to a stable , noise free , high order parameter value for @xmath45 deep in the biaxial phase region , and this order is due to the near perfect alignment of the molecular @xmath7-axes in a direction perpendicular to the plane hosting the bent director structure associated with the long molecular axes .",
    "this scenario is appealing for two reasons : the hamiltonian model is realistic as it accommodates both the perturbing interactions ( the last two terms in eqn.[eqn:1 ] ) , and secondly the substrates are needed to influence suitably only the long molecular axes , which is more practical . under these convenient conditions we find that in the biaxial phase , one can generate an in - plane order of high degree involving one of the minor axes of the molecules , while the bent director from the anchored alignment of the long axes is conveniently locked within the plane perpendicular to this dominant order .",
    "type - a film appears to be a good candidate for further studies of switching with external in - plane fields .",
    "type - b film on the other hand is frustrated on entering into the biaxial phase , apparently due to the competing energetic demands of different contributions to the hamiltonian arising from incompatible surface anchoring influences involving the minor axes .",
    "the effect of the variation of the thickness is marginal .",
    "the type - a film seems to undergo an anchoring - induced transition in its director structures when the @xmath40 is tuned .",
    "these two observations could to be useful inputs in designing a practical device with switchable in - plane order .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the type - a film , involving realistic lc biaxial molecular system with simple hybrid anchoring conditions imposed only on the long axes is a potential candidate to generate a high degree of in - plane order in the biaxial phase , amenable for coupling to external fields .",
    "the simulations are carried out in the centre for modelling simulation and design ( cmsd ) at the university of hyderabad .",
