    "the phase space of qcd in the temperature and quark chemical potential @xmath1 plane is shown schematically in fig .",
    "many of the transition lines and phases displayed in the figure are theoretical predictions with little experimental verification .",
    "we have studied the transition as the chemical potential is varied ( dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at a fixed temperature @xmath2 that is most likely above the region where a diquark condenses .",
    "we wanted to understand the fate of the topological susceptibility @xmath3 across the transition and to decide whether its possible change occurs at the same value of @xmath1 where the vector chiral symmetry is restored and the polyakov loop signal rises  @xcite .",
    "it is known that at the finite temperature transition the signal of @xmath3 drops abruptly for yang ",
    "mills theory  @xcite as well as for qcd with several values of the flavour number @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the present is the first work where a similar study is performed at the finite density transition ( the full account can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have performed the study on the lattice by simulating the theory with two colours in order to avoid the sign problem that in the three colour theory makes the importance sampling method impracticable ( for methods to overcome this problem see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we expect that this modification of true qcd has little impact on the results concerning gluon properties and in particular instanton physics .",
    "the main differences between two and three colour qcd regard aspects of the theory that we have not studied , like the hadron spectrum and the diquark condensed phase  @xcite .",
    "in fact in the two colour theory mesons are degenerate with baryons ( which are made of two quarks ) and the diquark condensate phase becomes superfluid instead of superconducting because two quarks in two colour qcd can create a colour blind condensate .",
    "we have simulated the model on a @xmath5 lattice at an inverse bare lattice gauge coupling @xmath6 and quark mass @xmath7 in units of lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "the wilson action was used for gauge fields and the standard action for 8 flavours of quarks in the staggered formulation .",
    "the hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm was chosen to update configurations .",
    "they we - re separated typically by 50100 steps of  the algorithm in order to well decorrelate the topology  @xcite .",
    "we followed the behaviour of several observables across the transition shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : chiral condensate @xmath9 , polyakov loop or wilson line @xmath10 , topological susceptibility @xmath3 , baryonic density @xmath11 and average plaquette @xmath12      the measurement of the topological susceptibility requires a careful treatment of composite operators .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the topological charge density operator that appears in the r.h.s . of the axial singlet anomaly .",
    "@xmath3 is related to the @xmath15 mass through the witten ",
    "veneziano mechanism  @xcite and to the chiral condensate in the massless limit  @xcite .",
    "eq.([chi_continuum ] ) can be rewritten in a more compact form , @xmath16 where the total topological charge @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the spacetime volume .",
    "this expression has only a formal meaning because it must be supplemented with a multiplicative renormalization for each power of the topological charge operator @xmath17  @xcite as well as a careful treatment of the contact divergences that appear when the two operators are evaluated at the same spacetime point  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure that we have followed to extract @xmath3 can be found in  @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", one has to define a lattice regularization @xmath20 of the topological charge density operator .",
    "the corresponding total lattice topological charge is @xmath21 and the lattice topological susceptibility is @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity is related to the physical susceptibility @xmath3 by the general expression  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a multiplicative renormalization of @xmath25 , @xmath8 is the lattice spacing and @xmath26 is an additive renormalization constant . in presence of composite operators",
    "the usual renormalization program in a renormalizable theory is not enough to fully renormalize a green s function .",
    "this is the origin of @xmath24 ( even in the case of the pure gauge theory where the topological charge operator has no anomalous dimensions ) . on the other hand part of the contact divergences that appear in the product of the two topological charge operators",
    "must be subtracted .",
    "this subtraction is defined as @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath26 is the value of @xmath28 in the sector of zero topological charge .",
    "this condition guarantees the obvious requirement that @xmath3 vanishes in that sector .",
    "one has to calculate the two constants @xmath24 and @xmath26 and insert them into eq.([chil ] ) in order to extract @xmath3 .",
    "we shall present the results in the form of the ratio @xmath29 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore we need not calculate @xmath24 and only @xmath26 is required .",
    "this additive renormalization constant was computed by using a non  perturbative method  @xcite .",
    "it is enough to calculate it for one single value of the chemical potential because @xmath26 is independent of infrared properties .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2 ] we show the resulting behaviour of the topological susceptibility as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "a clear cut drop is seen at the position @xmath30 .",
    "this sudden fall is an indication of the effective restoration of the axial singlet symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we do not show the analogous figures for the polyakov loop and chiral condensate behaviours ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . instead in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the derivatives of the three quantities ( topological susceptibility , polyakov loop and chiral condensate ) are superimposed to give evidence of the coincidence of the three transitions : they all happen at the same ( pseudo)critical value @xmath30 .",
    "single points are the result of the discrete derivatives computed from the measured data while the lines are the derivatives of the interpolations made with a natural cubic spline on each data set . since the theory deconfines at the same @xmath1 where @xmath31 vanishes , the path in the @xmath2@xmath1 diagram followed in our study possibly lies above the superfluid phase  ( as indicated in fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "@xcite .      in order to give an estimate of the main results in physical units ,",
    "we have done a second simulation of the model at zero chemical potential by varying the inverse bare lattice coupling @xmath32 on the same lattice volume and have measured the polyakov loop and chiral condensate .",
    "the data clearly reflected the existence of a critical @xmath33 .",
    "it was then assumed that the corresponding transition temperature @xmath34 lies in the range 100200 mev .",
    "hence a value for the lattice spacing at @xmath35 was obtained .",
    "this value was then run , by making use of the two  loop beta function , from @xmath35 to our working @xmath36 thus obtaining the lattice spacing at this beta @xmath37  fm ( errors derived from the imprecision on @xmath35 and from the inaccuracy of the estimate for @xmath34 respectively ) .",
    "this result allowed us to assign physical units to the various parameters of our simulation : @xmath38  mev ( errors are respectively due to the estimate of @xmath39 , the imprecision on @xmath35 and the rough approximation of @xmath34 ) and @xmath40  mev ( error on @xmath35 and on @xmath34 respectively ) .    notice that the numerical value of @xmath0 is roughly compatible with half of the mass of the lightest baryon ( in the two colour theory it is made of two quarks and degenerated with the pion ) . however we take the above numbers with caution because of the large systematic errors derived from the small and coarse lattice volume , the ( wrong ) gauge group and the inexact updating algorithm .      by repeating the simulation at very high values of the chemical potential , in principle one could test the perturbative region of the phase diagram .",
    "however the advent of the so  called pauli blocking makes that not viable .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , more and more fermions are placed in the lattice volume . since it contains a countable number of sites , the pauli principle imposes a maximum allowed number of fermions that can be placed on them . in our case",
    "the maximum allowed density is one baryon per site  @xcite .",
    "this maximum is attained for @xmath41 .",
    "after that point , fermions are frozen and the theory becomes entirely quenched .",
    "we have verified this statement by calculating the baryon density and the average plaquette .",
    "their data are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath11 becomes 1 and stays constant for all @xmath42 .",
    "also the average plaquette stays constant after @xmath43 and this constant coincides with the value obtained from a separate monte carlo study where the pure gauge theory was simulated ( represented by the down triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we stress that pauli blocking is a lattice effect with no counterpart in the continuum .",
