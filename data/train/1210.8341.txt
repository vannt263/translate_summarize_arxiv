    "for example in pr@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 @xcite and la@xmath5sr@xmath6nio@xmath7 @xcite , resistive switching were observed that may involve a dielectric breakdown of the charge ordered state , and collective depinning of holes on charge stripes , respectively . in the mott insulator am@xmath7x@xmath8 compounds , the electric field induced resistive switching",

    "[ optics_2](b ) ) .",
    "this implies that a temperature change of 200k-300k produces a tremendous modification of the optical conductivity over an energy scale exceeding 1 ev ( 12000 k ) .    on the one hand ,",
    "such features ( temperature dependence , spectral weight transfer ) are hard to reconcile with a simple disorder induced localization picture .",
    "actually , such unusual spectral weight transfer on large energy scale is known to occur in strongly correlated systems@xcite . on the other hand , these results",
    "can however not be satisfactory explained by only invoking strong correlations , since the low frequency spectral weight is expected to grow at low temperature for doped mott insulators , at variance with our observation.@xcite thus , neither disorder , nor electronic correlations alone can explain the puzzling properties of ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 .",

    "[ arpes]b ) .",
    "such an evolution will produce a redistribution of spectral weight over the energy scale of at least the entire band width ( 0.7ev ) , in good agreement with optical spectroscopy .",
    "if the mid - point of the leading edge is taken as a measure of this apparent gap , it increases from 20mev at 300k to 160mev at 100k .",
    "we note that 20mev is smaller than room temperature ( 25 mev ) , so that there will be many carrier thermally excited across the gap at this temperature .",
    "this high temperature pseudogap explains well the metallic - like spectra observed above 200k in optical spectroscopy .",
    "as the dispersion keeps a similar shape at high and low temperatures , we conclude that there is no dramatic reorganization of the electronic structure , but a gradual opening of a larger and larger gap .",
    "both arpes and optical conductivity measurements then suggest that ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 is at the verge of a temperature induced insulator to metal transition , although electronic correlations may not be particularly strong . moreover , the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity shares some similarity with that encountered in cdw , charge order or stripes systems such as pr@xmath53ca@xmath6mno@xmath4@xcite or la@xmath1nio@xmath54@xcite .",

    "figure [ structure2 ] presents the evolution of the @xmath12 and @xmath62 cell parameters between 300k and 90k .",
    "all parameters show smooth evolutions and no sign of structural phase transition was detected in the temperature range 90k-300k . despite this lack of phase transition",
    "we have undertaken structural refinements of the low temperature data .",
    "the refinement procedure is described in detailed in our previous work focused on the room temperature data @xcite . at 300k ,",
    "the most striking feature of the ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 structure is the large displacement modulation of the vanadium atoms along the @xmath62 direction .",
    "figure 1(b ) highlights that the atomic vanadium columns form along the @xmath12 direction sinusoidal - like waves with a strong modulation amplitude in the @xmath62 direction .",
    "interestingly , our structural work demonstrates that the vanadium displacement modulation is strongly reinforced as the temperature decreases from 300k to 200k .",
    "figure [ structure2 ] shows the longest and smallest v - v distances within the vs@xmath1 layer as the function of the temperature .",

    "the arpes gap nicely scale with the largest v - v distance [ fig .",
    "[ finalccl](a ) ] , while the spectral weight deduced again from both arpes or optics scale with the smallest v - v distance [ fig . [ finalccl](b ) ] .",
    "this strongly suggests that the evolution of the electronic structure is directly linked to the amplitude of the structural distortion .",
    "this behavior appears analogous to that of a charge density wave(cdw ) system@xcite and suggests that a strong electron phonon coupling is at play in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 .",
    "however , this misfit compound displays two noticeable differences compared to known cdw systems .",
    "first , the periodicity of the distortion is not connected to the fermi surface topology but imposed by the external potential of the las layer .",
    "second , the amplitude of the distortion is not fixed to a particular value optimizing the energy balance between the cost of elastic energy and the gain of electronic energy , but strongly depends on temperature .",
    "a more adequate description is likely the clusterization picture depicted in fig .",
    "[ structure2](c ) .",
    "this will naturally create heterogeneous charge distributions with electron localization preferrentially on the vanadium clusters .",
    "the seems to be the key parameter governing the conductivity .",
    "we have shown that temperature is obviously one parameter that can control the degree of metallicity , and it is natural to wonder whether other parameters should also tune this unusual insulating state@xcite .",
    "these findings shed some light on the non linear electrical properties found in this system .",
    "first , it rules out a mechanism based on the breakdown of a mott insulating state as previously proposed @xcite .",
    "conversely , it suggests that the non linear electrical properties observed in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 might share some common features with that encountered in cdw systems @xcite .",
    "however the non linear properties associated the depinning and collective motion of the cdw appear above a threshold field of the order of 0.01 - 0.1 v / cm @xcite .",
    "this is two order of magnitude lower than the threshold field observed in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 ( around 50 v / cm ) @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy might be related to the strong pinning effect of the las layer .",
    "but , on the other hand , the nonlinearities in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 do not obey the zener tunnelling law commonly observed in cdw systems @xcite or for the stripe depinning in la@xmath5sr@xmath6nio@xmath7 @xcite . in that respect ,",
    "the appearance of the non linear properties of ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 are more likely related to the release of a large number of mobile charge carriers initially localized in the vanadium clusters than to a collective motion analogous to the sliding of cdw . interestingly , the observation of a poole - frenkel mechanism ( i.e. , field assisted thermal emission of carriers ) for the non linearity in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 @xcite proves that the release of carriers is intimately related to the lowering of a thermal energy barrier by the electric field .",
    "we have observed that the electronic structure is very sensitive to changes of degree of vanadium clusterization with temperature .",
    "our work therefore suggest that the electric field could have a similar effect than temperature .",
    "this effetc could weaken the vanadium clusterization and subsequently reduce the localisation strengh on these clusters .",
    "such a mechanism would cause the breakdown of the insulating state and therefore easily explain the non linear electrical properties of ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 .",

    "is dramatically modified , although no structural transition occurs .",
    "concomitantly , an optical gap of 120 mev opens .",

    "<S> intriguing properties of the misfit layered chalcogenide ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 crystals were investigated by transport , optical measurements , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and x - ray diffraction . although no clear anomaly is found in transport properties as a function of temperature , a large spectral weight transfer , up to at least 1 ev , is observed by both optical and photoemission spectroscopies . </S>",
    "<S> arpes reveals that a nearly filled band with negative curvature , close enough from the fermi level at 300k to produce metallic - like behaviour as observed in optical conductivity spectra . at low temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is strongly modified , yielding to an insulating state with a optical gap of 120 mev . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate ( 3 + 1)d analysis of x - ray diffraction data shows that , although a phase transition does not occur , structural distortions increase as temperature is decreased , and vanadium clusterization is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the changes of electronic properties and structure are intimately related . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that structural distorsion play a major role in the insulating nature of ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 and that electronic correlation may not be important , contrary to previous belief . </S>",
    "<S> these results shed a new light on the mechanism at the origin of non - linear electric properties observed in ( las)@xmath0vs@xmath1 . </S>"
