    "entanglement provides us with a novel correlation between two or more parties , which can not be explained by any classical theories .",
    "in addition , the correlation can be successfully applied to quantum communication , which seems to be classically impossible .",
    "thus entanglement shared between several parties has been considered as one of the most significant resources in quantum information processing including quantum teleportation  @xcite and quantum key distribution  @xcite .    in order to perform a faithful quantum communication procedure in a given quantum network ,",
    "first of all , it should be required to prepare sufficient entanglement shared between desired parties . as a generalization of entanglement swapping  @xcite",
    ", there exists a process to remotely distribute entanglement between different parties  @xcite , which is here called the _ remote preparation of entanglement _ ( rpe ) .",
    "one of the simplest cases of the rpe is as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rpe ] ) : assume that alice ( system 2 ) , bob ( system 4 ) and the supplier sapna ( systems 1 and 3 ) share an initial state @xmath0 , and sapna performs a joint measurement on systems 1 and 3 .",
    "then entanglement can be probabilistically shared between alice and bob .",
    "a simple example of remote preparation of entanglement . ]",
    "it has been known  @xcite that the possible average amount of the shared entanglement is bounded by the product of entanglement amounts of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two - qubit states then the bound can be shown in terms of the _ concurrence _",
    "@xmath3  @xcite as follows  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability of the resulting state @xmath6 on subsystems 24 after the joint measurement on subsystems 13 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the concurrence of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 , respectively .    however , we remark that the maximal average amount of entanglement by the rpe can not generally attain to the bound , the product of entanglement amounts of the two states . especially , for two - qubit states @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "there does not in general exist a measurement to saturate the inequality  ( [ eq : gs ] ) .",
    "we note that if we can discover a measurement to achieve the maximal average amount of entanglement by the rpe in a given quantum network then we can learn how faithful quantum communication can be performed in the quantum network , and this can be also employed in constituting a quantum network for a desired level of quantum communication . on this account",
    ", it may be more important to calculate the maximal average amount of entanglement obtainable by the rpe or to find out the optimal measurement for the rpe than to acquire a constant bound in a given quantum network .    in order to evaluate amount of entanglement",
    ", we need an entanglement quantification .",
    "since the negativity is one of the most computable measures of entanglement among several entanglement quantifications , we here deal with the _ negativity _",
    "@xmath10  @xcite , which is defined as @xmath11 for a two - qudit state @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the trace norm , and @xmath14 is the partial transposition .",
    "moreover , since the negativity is an entanglement monotone  @xcite , it can be regarded as a good measure of entanglement , even though the bound entanglement with positive partial transposition  @xcite can not be detected by the negativity .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possible amount of entanglement by the rpe in terms of the negativity , and show that , given two identical isotropic states as initial states , the rpe by the generalized bell - measurement is optimal among rank - one measurements if the isotropic states have a certain fidelity with a maximally entangled state in higher dimensional quantum systems , or if the fidelity of the isotropic states is greater than a certain value depending on the dimension of quantum systems . in addition , we show that there exists a measurement better than the generalized bell - measurement with respect to the rpe when the isotropic states have small fidelity .",
    "in this section , we show that the generalized bell - measurement among rank - one measurements is an optimal measurement for the rpe presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : rpe ] , provided that two identical isotropic states with a certain fidelity are initial states .",
    "let @xmath15 be the isotropic state with fidelity @xmath16 in the two - qudit system , where @xmath17 is a maximally entangled state in the two - qudit system , @xmath18 is the @xmath19-dimensional identity operator , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we note that the isotropic states form a generic class of two - qudit states , to which any arbitrary two - qudit state can be transformed via local quantum operations and classical communication , and moreover it is not difficult to analyze their amounts of entanglement computed by the negativity . hence quantum networks consisting of the isotropic states are here dealt with .",
    "we consider @xmath22 as an initial state .",
    "for the sake of convenience , we let @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath25 , and @xmath22 becomes @xmath26    we now suppose that a rank - one measurement on subsystems 13 is performed , and let @xmath27 be a measurement operator of the rank - one measurement . due to the symmetry of isotropic states over local unitary operations , without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "it follows from straightforward calculations that @xmath31 where @xmath32 then @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the probability to obtain one measurement outcome after the rank - one measurement is @xmath34 , and the resulting state @xmath35 in subsystems 24 after the measurement becomes @xmath36    we note that @xmath37 for any operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the @xmath19-dimensional quantum system .",
    "hence , it can be clearly shown that one outcome after performing an arbitrary rank - one measurement on subsystems 13 is always obtained with probability @xmath34 , and it can be also shown that the resultant state in subsystems 24 is equivalent to the state @xmath35 up to local unitary operations , if the pure state corresponding to the measurement outcome has the same schmidt coefficients as those of the state @xmath40 .",
    "we now take into account the partial transpose on subsystem 4 .",
    "then the partial transpose of @xmath35 is @xmath41 thus , for each @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 for each @xmath44 , let @xmath45 , then we also have @xmath46    it follows from eqs .  ( [ eq : pt_eigenii ] ) and ( [ eq : pt_eigenijp ] ) that @xmath47 s and @xmath48 s are eigenvectors of @xmath35 , and form an orthonormal basis for the two - qudit system . hence , we can obtain that the negativity of @xmath35 , @xmath49 , is @xmath50 which is less than or equal to @xmath51 it is clear that eq .  ( [ eq : final ] ) becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of all ordered pairs @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    since @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ", it can be shown that if @xmath19 is sufficiently large to satisfy @xmath57 then @xmath58 furthermore , it can be also shown that if the dimension @xmath19 is large enough to satisfy @xmath59 then @xmath60 is less than or equal to @xmath61 that is , the inequality @xmath62 holds .",
    "thus , we obtain that if the dimension @xmath19 is sufficiently large such that @xmath63 then @xmath64 for any state @xmath40 .",
    "hence , it can be obtained that , given a rank - one measurement of subsystem 13 with measurement operators @xmath65 on the state @xmath66 , if the inequality  ( [ eq : d_final_condition ] ) holds then @xmath67 where @xmath68 s are the resultant states on subsystem 24 after the rank - one measurement , @xmath69 is the probability to obtain @xmath70 as a measurement outcome , and @xmath71 with the generalized pauli operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the two - qudit generalized bell states , since @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we remark that the left - hand side and the right - hand side in the inequality  ( [ eq : average_optimal ] ) represent the average amount of entanglement of the resultant states after the rank - one measurement and after the generalized bell measurement , respectively .",
    "this implies that , under the condition in the inequality  ( [ eq : d_final_condition ] ) , the generalized bell measurement is optimal among rank - one measurements with respect to the rpe .",
    "in addition , the inequality  ( [ eq : average_optimal ] ) also holds if @xmath16 is more than a certain value depending on the dimension so that @xmath76 since the inequality  ( [ eq : f_condition ] ) is equivalent to the inequality  ( [ eq : d_final_condition ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main ] assume that the initial states are two identical isotropic states in the two - qudit quantum system",
    ". then the rpe by the generalized bell - measurement is optimal among rank - one measurements if the dimension of the quantum system is large enough to satisfy the inequality  ( [ eq : f_condition ] ) , or if the isotropic states have fidelity more than a certain value depending on the dimension as seen in the inequality  ( [ eq : f_condition ] ) .",
    "we remark that for almost all initial states in higher dimensional quantum systems , the rpe by the generalized bell - measurement is optimal , since the right - hand side in the inequality  ( [ eq : f_condition ] ) tends to zero as the dimension @xmath19 goes to the infinity .",
    "in this section , we show that there exists a measurement to give higher entanglement than the generalized bell - measurement for the rpe when the two identical isotropic states as initial states have small fidelity .      in this subsection , we assume that @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and consider a measurement whose measurement operators are @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , where @xmath84 then it can be easily shown that the measurement is a rank - one projective measurement , and it can be also shown that @xmath85 is more than @xmath86 for @xmath87 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] .",
    "it follows that if the given isotropic states have fidelity @xmath16 satisfying the inequality  ( [ eq : example_f_ineq_3d ] ) then the rpe by this measurement provides higher entanglement than the rpe by the generalized bell - measurement in terms of the negativity .      in this subsection",

    "it follows from tedious but straightforward calculations that if the fidelity @xmath16 of the initial isotropic states satisfies the following inequality @xmath93 then the measurement gives higher amount of entanglement than the generalized bell - measurement for the rpe .",
