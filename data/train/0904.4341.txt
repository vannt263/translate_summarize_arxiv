    "the main unresolved problems concerning the microscopic physics of he - ii are the structure of the composed condensate , the nature of the @xmath4-transition , and the role of microscopic vortex rings .",
    "the form of the he - ii quasiparticle spectrum has been forecasted by landau for the first time @xcite . in feynman s",
    "known works @xcite , an opportunity to determine this spectrum making use of the structure factor has been demonstrated .",
    "feynman intuitively found the structure of the @xmath1 wave function for the state of he - ii with a single phonon and approximately deduced the he - ii quasiparticle spectrum . according to feynman and cohen , @xmath5@xmath6 where @xmath2 is the wave function of the ground state , @xmath7 are collective variables @xcite , and @xmath3 is the total number of atoms in helium .",
    "however , it has not been shown in feynman s works that function ( 2 ) is the eigenfunction of the @xmath3-particle schrdinger equation .",
    "feynman s ideas have been developed in a great number of works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the feynman - cohen function has been specified in works @xcite where the analysis of the total hamiltonian of the system has been carried out",
    ". a more accurate form of the function @xmath8 and the structure of the function @xmath2 have been found in works 6,7,8,9,10,11 , where @xmath2 and @xmath9 were sought as the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation .",

    "@xcite , taking advantage of the mcv , the @xmath2 and @xmath1 functions of helium - ii have been calculated making use of the model potential of interaction between he@xmath10 atoms with one fitting parameter . nevertheless , as was indicated in 9,10,11 , the derivation of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 wave functions , as well as the he - ii quasiparticle spectrum , starting from the he - ii structure factor , known from the experiment , rather than from the model potential has significant advantages . in this case , the problem does not contain fitting parameters , and one can avoid the task of description of atomic interaction at small distances , which arises because of atoms extension @xcite .    such an approach has been considered in work @xcite , where @xmath0 was found in a zeroth - order approximation , while @xmath9 and the he - ii quasiparticle spectrum in a first one .",
    "the obtained spectrum @xmath11 agreed well with the experiment . in this work",
    ", we calculated @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 more accurately .",
    "namely , we found a first correction to @xmath0 and a second ones to @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "in doing so , we used the equation for @xmath2 , derived in work @xcite ( below , we coin it as the vakarchuk equation ) .",
    "actually , the expansion parameter of the problem was the function @xmath12 ( see fig .  1 ) , the average value of which within the interval @xmath13 was about @xmath14 ; i.e. the parameter was not small .",
    "therefore , the corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath11 , generally speaking , were not small too , and their calculation was of interest .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the equations and the method of determining @xmath2 were exposed in works @xcite .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , the interaction between he@xmath33 atoms does not present explicitly , and @xmath2 is connected with the he - ii structure factor only , so that such a way of finding @xmath2 allows the problem of descriptions of interaction between he@xmath10 atoms at small distances @xcite to be avoided partially : provided strong overlapping of he@xmath10 atoms , the description of atomic interaction using the interaction potential becomes inaccurate , because the atomic structure becomes important under such conditions , and it is necessary , generally speaking , to solve a quantum - mechanical problem of interaction of two nuclei and four electrons .",
    "the function @xmath2 [ eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) ] , found from eqs .",
    "( [ 6])([11 ] ) , takes short - range correlations into account more correctly than that found from the model potential @xcite .",

    "( [ 4])([11 ] ) was the break of series ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "but , since the model does not contain fitting parameters , the accuracy of approximation ( [ 5 ] ) can be estimated by comparing both the theoretical spectrum of he - ii quasiparticles and the theoretical potential of interaction between he@xmath10 atoms with experimental ones .    in order to find the wave function of the ground state",

    "the solution of the integral equation ( [ 8 ] ) can not be found by the iteration method , so that we used the newton one @xcite for this purpose . as a result ,",
    "two solutions were obtained , one of which , with a smaller energy per atom @xmath47 ( @xmath48 in a zeroth - order approximation and @xmath49 in the experiment ) , being taken as the ground state .",
    "this solution for @xmath46 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a significant body of information concerning the properties of @xmath2 is included into the function @xmath50 where @xmath51 the behavior of @xmath52 at @xmath53 shows how quickly the function @xmath2 decays if the atoms overlap .",
    "2 represents the function @xmath52 for a zeroth - order ( [ 14 ] ) and a first approximation for @xmath46 , and for @xmath46 found in a second approximation , starting from the model potential @xcite .",

    "one can separate a two - particle summand of the form @xmath55 from the addend in the r.h.s . of ( [ 5 ] ) , see @xcite , but a calculation shows that the account of @xmath56 renormalizes @xmath52 very slightly , by a few percent only .",
    "thus , provided that two he@xmath10 atoms overlap , the wave function of the ground state diminishes by a factor of @xmath57 , so that a sharp reduction does not occur , although the probability density @xmath58 decreases rather strongly , by a factor of 1000 .",
    "it means that the he@xmath10 atom possesses properties which are intermediate between soft- and hard - core ones . in case , for example , that 10 pairs of atoms overlap , @xmath2 decreases by a factor of @xmath59 as compared to its value for a uniform distribution of atoms without overlapping .",

    "the potential changes appreciably even if eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) are rewritten in another but equivalent form .",
    "the inaccuracy of the @xmath90 determination stems from the fact that , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , the potential @xmath90 depends strongly on the @xmath46 values at @xmath28 s that are not small , @xmath97 , because the summand @xmath98 makes a contribution to @xmath90 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 are small at such @xmath28 s , but the corrections to @xmath46 turn out to be of about @xmath46 itself .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 is not determined exactly at considerable @xmath28 ; this circumstance has almost no influence on the resulting quasiparticle spectrum , but induces a significant error while finding @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we can only estimate the potential @xmath90 , but in order to calculate @xmath90 with a higher accuracy , one must determine the next approximations for @xmath46 and measure @xmath20 more precisely .",

    "this procedure was argued by a certain reasoning , in particular , by that taking the delocalization of atoms into account means the partial consideration of higher correlations . as was noted in @xcite ,",
    "such a solution is the first iteration of the schrdinger equation represented in the form of a functional integral .",
    "drawbacks of the models are as follows : the exact solutions for @xmath0 and @xmath101 are infinite series , and it is not clear to a which extent the shadow factors will allow one to evaluate this series ; moreover , too much fps are in use .",

    "dyson ones 31,32 .",
    "+ models b and c involve fps .    in our opinion , the most perspective may be the field - theoretic approaches of types ( iii , b ) and ( iii , c ) , the mc method , or quantum - mechanical methods that have not been discovered yet , which will start from exact microscopic equations , will not use fitting parameters , and where the expansion in a small parameter will be carried out . at the same time , approaches ( ii ) form a necessary complement to ( iii ) ones .",
    "to summarize , in this work , using the method of collective variables , the spectrum of he - ii quasiparticles has been obtained , and the wave functions of the ground and a first excited state of helium - ii have been found approximately , without introducing any fitting parameter into the model .",
    "we have solved the equations that had been derived from the exact microscopic equations . a single inaccuracy of the method consisted in breaking the series for @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
