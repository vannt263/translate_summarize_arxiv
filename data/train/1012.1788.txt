    "central pattern generators ( cpgs ) are often modeled as coupled nonlinear oscillators delivering phase - locked signals .",

    "explicit rotational coupling between neighbouring oscillators has been used in earlier work ( see @xcite , @xcite ) to generate a traveling wave or out - of - phase state . here",
    ", we use inhibitory ( repulsive ) coupling to achieve a similar effect in perhaps a more physical way , allowing indeed the system itself to compute couplings achieving the out - of - phase behavior .",
    "while all our derivations aim at establishing global convergence results , we found some significant qualitative differences between these two types of couplings , such as the existence of two degenerate out - of - phase states in repulsive coupling , but not in rotational coupling .",
    "in addition , while rotational coupling preserves the amplitude of the coupled oscillators , repulsive coupling increases the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "in fact , this increase in amplitude is the key factor behind generating high frequency oscillation patterns in the heartbeat of a leech model , to be analyzed in the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in part ii",
    ", we obtain out - of - phase and synchronous solutions for nearest neighbor coupled andronov - hopf oscillators , and derive the condition for the existence of an out - of - phase state .",
    "in part iii , either the out - of - phase or the synchronous solution is shown to be globally stable using techniques from contraction theory ( for original derivation of contraction theory see @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of the two different types of behavior is determined by the values of the coupling constant , with a positive coupling constant generating the out - of - phase state and a negative constant resulting in a globally stable synchronous solution . in part",
    "iv , the synchronous and the out - of - phase arrays are globally coupled to each other in a model inspired by the cpg in the heartbeat of a leech .",
    "building on prior results , the bifurcation value for the onset of high frequency oscillations in the synchronous array is derived .",
    "in this section we solve for the steady - state dynamics of the nearest neighbor coupled andronov - hopf oscillators , showing that both synchronous and out - phase solutions exist . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the global stability properties of these solutions applying techniques from contraction theory .",
    "we first consider a ring of nearest neighbor coupled andronov - hopf oscillators , of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a two dimensional vector describing the dynamics of the @xmath2th oscillator , with @xmath3 given by : @xmath4 in complex form , eqns .",

    "is thereby given by:@xmath17 in the case of oscillators in a line , coupled with @xmath12 , the above phase difference is the only globally stable solution . the situation becomes more complicated in a ring coupled model when @xmath13 is odd . in this case",

    ". then the 1st and the 3rd oscillator will actually be in - phase , which is an unstable state . requiring the neighboring oscillators to be maximally out of phase",
