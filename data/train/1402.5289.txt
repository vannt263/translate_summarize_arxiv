    "we have performed a computational study of the kuramoto model running on top of the hc network ( details are given in the methods section ) .",
    "our results reveal the existence of an intermediate regime placed between the coherent and the incoherent phase ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is characterized by broad quasi - periodic temporal oscillations of @xmath19 which wildly depend upon the realization of intrinsic frequencies @xcite .",
    "anomalously large sampling times would be required to extract good statistics for the actual mean values and variances .",
    "collective oscillations of @xmath19 are a straightforward manifestation of partial synchronization and they are robust against changes in the frequency distribution ( e.g. gaussian , lorentzian , uniform , etc . ) whereas the location and width of the intermediate phase depend upon details .",
    "as this phenomenology is reminiscent of griffiths phases posed in between order and disorder and stemmig from the existence of semi - isolated regions @xcite it is natural to investigate how the hc hierarchical modular structure affects synchronization dynamics .",
    "any network with perfectly isolated and independently synchronized moduli trivially exhibits oscillations of @xmath19 , with amplitude peaking at times when maximal mutual synchronization happens to be incidentally achieved .",
    "such oscillations can become chaotic if a finite and relatively small number of different coherent moduli are coupled together @xcite .",
    "thus , in a connected network without delays or other additional ingredients , oscillations in the global coherence are the trademark of strong modular structure with weakly interconnected moduli .",
    "strong modular organization into distinct hierarchical levels is indeed present in the hc as reveled by standard community detection algorithms @xcite and as already discussed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , we have found that the optimal partition into disjoint communities i.e .",
    "the partition maximizing the modularity parameter @xcite corresponds to a division in @xmath23 communities ( see fig.1d ) while , at a higher hierarchical level , a separation into just @xmath21 moduli the @xmath21 cerebral hemispheres is obtained @xcite ( fig.1d ) .",
    "obviously these @xmath21 coarser moduli include the @xmath23 above as sub - moduli .",
    "although more levels of hierarchical partitioning could be inferred ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) , for the sake of simplicity we focus on these two levels @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath23 and @xmath21 moduli , respectively .     and two interfacial nodes . results of the numerical integration of the @xmath27 kuramoto equations ( blue points ) are in strikingly good agreement with the integration of eqs.([oa ] ) ( solid blue line )",
    "local block - wise order parameters are shown for comparison ( small symbols ; dashed lines are guides to the eye ) .",
    "a first transition , where local order emerges , occurs at @xmath28 , while global coherence is reached at @xmath29 . in the intermediate region",
    ", @xmath19 oscillates ( inset ) , revealing the lack of global coherence .",
    "despite the simplicity of this toy model , these results constitute the essential building - block upon which further levels of complexity rely ( see main text).,width=453 ]      to shed further light on the properties of synchronization on the hc , we consider a very simple network model allowing for analytical understanding which will constitute the elementary `` building - block '' for subsequent more complex analyses .",
    "this consists of a few blocks with very large internal connectivity and very sparse inter - connectivity .",
    "each block is composed by a bulk of @xmath30 nodes that share no connection with the outside and a relatively small `` interfacial '' set that connects with nodes in other blocks . for instance , in the simplest realization , consisting of just two blocks connected by a single pair of nodes ( fig.2 ) , each block is endowed with local coherence @xmath31 , average phase @xmath32 , and average characteristic frequency @xmath33 , while 1-node interfaces have perfect coherence @xmath34 , phase @xmath35 , and characteristic frequency @xmath36 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath37 , and the oa ansatz can be safely applied to each block ( large @xmath38 ) but not to single - node interfaces . in the particular case",
    "( convenient for analytical treatment ) in which @xmath39 are zero - mean lorentz distributions @xmath40 with spreads @xmath41 , the resulting set of oa equations can be easily shown to be : @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ \\dot{\\varphi}_\\mathrm{a } & = &    \\nu_\\mathrm{a}+ k \\left [ mr_\\mathrm{a}\\sin(\\psi_\\mathrm{a}-\\varphi_\\mathrm{a})+\\sin(\\varphi_\\mathrm{b }      -\\varphi_\\mathrm{a})\\right ]   \\label{oa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( together with @xmath34 for each 1-node interface ) , and a symmetric set ( @xmath43 ) for block @xmath44 .",
    "the solution of eq.(2 ) displayed in fig.2 reveals a transition to local coherence within each block at a certain threshold value of @xmath28 .",
    "as soon as local order is attained , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , from eq.(2 ) the mutual synchronization process obeys @xmath47 and a symmetrical equation for @xmath48 . for small @xmath10 ,",
    "the right - hand side is dominated by @xmath49 : whereas the average value @xmath50 becomes arbitrarily small within blocks ( assuming that @xmath38 is large ) , the frequency @xmath51 does not .",
    "consequently , synchronization between the two blocks through the interfacial link is frustrated : each block remains internally synchronized but is unable to achieve coherence with the other over a broad interval of coupling strengths .",
    "this interval is delimited above by a second transition at @xmath52 , where @xmath10 is large enough as to overcome frustration and generate global coherence .",
    "this picture is confirmed by numerical integration of the full system of @xmath16 coupled kuramoto equations as well as by its oa approximation ( eq.(2 ) ) , both in remarkably good agreement .",
    "therefore , local and global coherences have their onsets at two well - separated transition points @xcite and similarly to the much more complex hc case @xmath53 oscillates in the intermediate regime ( fig.2 ) .",
    "similar results hold for versions of the model with more than two moduli ( e.g. @xmath20 ; see below ) .",
    "the existence of two distinct ( local and global ) transitions had already been reported in a recent study of many blocks with much stronger inter - moduli connections than here @xcite ( even if , owing to this difference , no sign of an intermediate oscillatory phase was reported ) .",
    "in particular , the value of two - block models has already been explored in the past , for systems of identical oscillators with non - zero phase lags , in which each node is coupled equally to all the others in its community , and less strongly to those in the other @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "local coherence emerged for large enough values of the phase lag .",
    "our two - block model shows that the presence of `` structural bottlenecks '' between moduli combined with heterogeneous frequencies at their contact nodes ( interfaces ) are essential ingredients to generate a broad region of global oscillations in @xmath53 , even in the absence of phase lag .",
    "still , it is obviously a too - simplistic model to account for all the rich phenomenology emerging on the hc , as we show now .",

    "it reveals that ( fig.3a ) local coherences exhibit oscillatory patterns in time ( with characteristic frequencies typically between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) and that ( fig.3b ) the transition to local coherence at progressively higher hierarchical level occurs at progressively larger values of @xmath10 ; i.e. coherence emerges out of a hierarchical bottom - up process as illustrated above for the for the two - block model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "observe , however , that local oscillations were not present in the two - block model .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath23 moduli in the hc are on their turn composed of finer sub - moduli and that structural frustration , as introduced above , affects all hierarchical levels .",
    "the average variance of local coherences ( called chimera index , @xmath62 ) @xcite exhibits a marked peak reflecting maximal configurational variability at the transition point for the corresponding level ( fig .",
    "3b - c and methods section ) .",
    "similar intra - modular oscillatory patterns dubbed _ chimera states_ have been recently found @xcite in kuramoto models in which explicit phase lags induce a different kind of frustration , hindering global synchronization . strictly speaking ,",
    "chimeras are defined in systems of identical oscillators .",
    "in such a case , a non - zero phase lag term is essential for partial synchronization to occur .",
    "realistic models of the brain , however , require oscillators to be heterogenous . states of partial synchronization in empirical brain networks with frequency heterogeneity have been found for kuramoto models with explicit time delays @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the chimera - like states put forward here have a purely structural origin , as they arise from the network topology .",
    "it was noted in the past that synchronization in a synthetic network with hubs could be limited to those hubs by tuning clustering properties , and global order could be attained in a monotonous step - like fashion upon increasing @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "fig.3b instead reveals that the ordering process in the hierarchical modular hc may be non - monotonous : coherence does not systematically grow with @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the emergence of local order in some community may hinder or reduce coherence in others , inducing local `` desynchronization '' and reflecting the metastable nature of the explored states .",
    "fixing all intrinsic frequencies to be identical allows us to focus specifically on structural effects .",
    "thus , we consider , without loss of generality , the simple case @xmath63 , and define the `` activity '' @xmath64 . in this case",
    ", perfect asymptotic coherence should emerge for all values of @xmath10 but , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3d , the convergence towards @xmath65 turns out to be extremely slow ( much slower than exponential ) .",
    "this effect can be analytically investigated assuming that , for large enough times , all phase differences are relatively small .",
    "then , up to first order , @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the elements of the laplacian matrix @xcite . solving the linear problem , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the @xmath24-th laplacian eigenvalue ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 the @xmath4-th component of the corresponding eigenvector . given that the averaged order parameter can be written as @xmath72 , averaging over initial conditions , and considering that ( as the laplacian has zero row - sums @xcite ) @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the standard deviation of the initial phases .",
    "this expression holds for any connected network . as usual , the larger the spectral gap @xmath76 , the more `` entangled '' @xcite the network and thus the more difficult to divide it into well separated moduli ( @xmath77 only for disconnected networks ) @xcite . for large spectral gaps all timescales are fast , and the last expression can be approximated by its leading contribution , ensuing exponential relaxation to @xmath65 , as in fact observed in well - connected network architectures ( erds - rnyi , scale free , etc .",
    "this is not the case for the hc matrix , for which a tail of small non - degenerate eigenvalues is encountered ( see fig.3e and @xcite ) .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath78 in the tail corresponds to a natural division of moduli into sub - moduli @xcite , and the broad tail reflects the heterogeneity in the resulting modular sizes . as a consequence , each of these eigenvalues with its associated large timescale",
    ", @xmath79 contributes to the sum above , giving rise to a convolution of relaxation processes , entailing anomalously - slow dynamics , which could not be explained by a single - level modular network ( see fig.3d - e ) : slow dynamics necessarily stems from the existence of a hierarchy of moduli and structural bottlenecks .",
    "as explained in methods , in the case of the hc the convolution of different times scales gives rise to stretched - exponential decay , which perfectly fits with numerical results in fig.3 .",
    "it was noted in the past that strongly modular networks exhibit isolated eigenvalues in the lower edge of the laplacian spectrum .",
    "synchronization would develop in a step - wise process in time , where each transient would be given by each isolated eigenvalue @xcite . in our case , the depth of the hierarchical organization and the strength of topological disorder produce instead a quasi - continuous tail of eigenvalues , and the step - wise process is replaced by an anomalous stretched - exponential behavior .      to shed additional light on the previous findings for the hc i.e .",
    "the emergence of chimera - like states and anomalously slow dynamics we suggest to go beyond the single - level modular network model and study hierarchical modular networks ( hmn ) in which moduli exists within moduli in a nested way at various scales @xcite .",
    "hmn are assembled in a bottom - up fashion : local fully - connected moduli ( e.g. of @xmath80 nodes ) are used as building blocks .",
    "they are recursively grouped by establishing additional inter - moduli links in a level - dependent way as sketched in fig.4(top ) @xcite .    , @xmath81 basal fully connected blocks of size @xmath38 are linked pairwise into super - blocks by establishing a fixed number @xmath82 of random unweighted links between the elements of each ( @xmath83 in the fig . ) .",

    ", width=453 ]    our computational analyses of the kuramoto dynamics on hmn substrates ( see fig.4 ) reveal : ( i ) a sequence of synchronization transitions for progressively higher hierarchical levels at increasing values of @xmath10 , ( ii ) chimera - like states at every hierarchical level , resulting in a hierarchy of metastable states with maximal variability at the corresponding transition points , ( iii ) extremely slow relaxation toward the coherent state when all internal frequencies are identical .",
    "furthermore , anomalies in the laplacian spectrum analogous to those of the hc network are observed for hmn matrices ; in particular , the lower edge of the hmn laplacian spectrum has been recently shown to exhibit a continuous exponential lifshitz tail @xmath93 for @xmath94 , with @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "taking the continuum limit of eq.([eq : discrete_lambda ] ) , we find @xmath96 , which can be evaluated with the saddle - point method ( see methods ) , leading to @xmath97 i.e. anomalous stretched - exponential asymptotic behavior , in excellent agreement with computational results ( see fig.4d ) . therefore , hierarchical modular networks constitute a parsimonious and adequate model for reproducing all the complex synchronization phenomenology of the hc .    a crucial role in the emergence of such behavior",
    "is played by disorder .",
    "one would be tempted to believe that all networks characterized by a finite spectral dimension could potentially give rise to this phenomenology .",
    "this is obviously not the case for a regular lattice , where the spectral gap is always well defined . a fractal lattice or an ordered tree ,",
    "on the other hand , could exhibit a hierarchy of discrete low eigenvalues , whose multiplicities reflect system symmetries . the introduction of disorder , as in hmns , is then necessary in order to transform such hierarchy of discrete levels into a continuous lifshitz tail , leading eventually to the behavior predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : stretched ] ) .",
    "simple models of synchronization dynamics exhibit an unexpectedly rich phenomenology when operating on top of empirical human brain networks .",
    "this complexity includes oscillatory behavior of the order parameter suggesting the existence of relatively isolated structural communities or moduli , that as a matter of fact can be identified by using standard community detection algorithms .",
    "even more remarkably , oscillations in the level of internal coherence are also present within these moduli , suggesting the existence of a whole hierarchy of nested levels of organization , as also found in the recent literature relying on a variety of approaches @xcite .",
    "aimed at unveiling this complex behavior we have introduced a family of hierarchical modular networks and studied them in order to assess what structural properties are required in order to reproduce the complex synchronization patterns observed in brain networks .    in the absence of frequency dispersion , perfect coherence is achieved in synthetic hierarchical networks by following a bottom - up ordering dynamics in which progressively larger communities with inherently different timescales become coherent ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this hierarchically nested synchronization process is constrained and altered by structural bottlenecks as carefully described here for the simpler two - block toy model at all hierarchical levels .",
    "this structural complexity brings about anomalously - slow dynamics at very large timescales .",
    "observe that the hc , in spite of being a coarse - grained mapping of a brain network , already shows strong signals of this ideal hierarchical architecture as reflected in its anomalously slow synchronization dynamics as well as in the presence of non - degenerate eigenvalues in the lower edge of its laplacian spectrum , acting as a fingerprint of structural heterogeneity and complexity .",
    "we stress that such a complex phenomenology would be impossible to obtain in networks with stronger connectivity patterns ( e.g. with the small world property ) such as scale free - networks or high - degree random graphs .",
    "even the generic presence of simple communities may not be sufficient to grant the emergence of frustration : the uniqueness of the human connectome , and of hierarchical modular networks in general , resides in the strong separation into distinct levels , which the synchronization dynamics is able to resolve only at well - separated values of the coupling @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of intrinsic frequency heterogeneity , the described slow ordering process is further frustrated .",
    "actually , for small values of the coupling constant @xmath10 the system remains trapped into metastable and chimera - like states with traits of local coherence at different hierarchical levels . in this case , inter - moduli frequency barriers need to be overcome before weakly connected moduli achieve mutual coherence .",
    "this is clearly exemplified by the separation between distinct peaks in the chimera index @xmath98 in figs .",
    "3 - 4 , each one signaling the onset of an independent synchronization process at a given level ( see methods ) .",
    "the result is a complex synchronization landscape , which is especially rich and diverse in the intermediate regime put forward here .    including other realistic ingredients such as explicit phase frustration @xcite or time delays @xcite to our simplistic approach should only add complexity to the structural frustration effect reported here .",
    "it is also expected that more refined models including neuro - realistic ingredients leading to collective oscillations would generate similar results , but this remains to be explored in future works .",
    "addition of noise to the kuramoto dynamics would allow the system to escape from metastable states .",
    "stochasticity can overcome the `` potential barriers '' between mutually incoherent moduli as well as re - introduce de - synchronization effects .",
    "these combined effects can make the system able to explore the nested hierarchy of attractors , allowing one to shed some light into the complex synchronization patterns in real brain networks .",
    "actually , spontaneous dynamical fluctuations have been measured in the resting state of human brains @xcite ; these are correlated across diverse segregated moduli and characterized by very slow fluctuations , of typical frequency @xmath99 , in close agreement with those found here ( fig.3 ) .",
    "accordingly , it has been suggested that the brain is routinely exploring different states or attractors @xcite and that in order to enhance spontaneous switching between attractors brain networks should operate close to a critical point , allowing for large intrinsic fluctuations which on their turn entail attractor `` surfing '' and give access to highly varied functional configurations @xcite and , in particular , to maximal variability of phase synchrony @xcite .",
    "the existence of multiple attractors and noise - induced surfing is largely facilitated in the broad intermediate regime first elucidated here , implying that a precise fine tuning to a critical point might not be required to guarantee functional avantages usually associated with criticality @xcite : the role usually played by a critical point is assumed by a broad intermediate region in hierarchically architectured complex systems @xcite .",
    "finally , let us remark that our results might also be of relevance for other hierarchically organized systems such as gene regulatory networks @xcite for which coherent activations play a pivotal role @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model is simulated by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) .",
    "computations are carried out using both a 4th order runge - kutta method of fixed step size @xmath100 and an 8th order dormand - prince method with adaptive step size .",
    "both methods lead to compatible results within precision limits .",
    "the robustness of the observation of a novel intermediate phase between incoherent and coherent ones is assessed by choosing different functional forms for the frequency distribution @xmath7 ( lorentzian , gaussian , uniform ) , and by implementing variations of eq .",

    ", a hierarchical network can be divided into a set of communities .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath98 is defined as follows : ( i ) in the steady ( oscillatory ) state , and for each time @xmath5 , local order parameters @xmath102 for each community @xmath4 are calculated and their variance across communities @xmath103 is stored ; ( ii ) the chimera index is computed as the time average @xmath104 . having @xmath105 at a given hierarchical level @xmath24 implies that local order is only partial as @xmath106 fluctuates , giving rise to a chimera - like state . on the other hand , @xmath107 means that each local order parameter at that level is @xmath108 , and local order has been attained",

    "<S> the spontaneous emergence of coherent behavior through synchronization plays a key role in neural function , and its anomalies often lie at the basis of pathologies . here </S>",
    "<S> we employ a parsimonious ( mesoscopic ) approach to study analytically and computationally the synchronization ( kuramoto ) dynamics on the actual human - brain connectome network . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the existence of a so - far - uncovered intermediate phase , placed between the standard synchronous and asynchronous phases , i.e. between order and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this novel phase stems from the hierarchical modular organization of the connectome . where one would expect a hierarchical synchronization process </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the interplay between structural bottlenecks and quenched intrinsic frequency heterogeneities at many different scales , gives rise to frustrated synchronization , metastability , and chimera - like states , resulting in a very rich and complex phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover the origin of the dynamic freezing behind these features by using spectral graph theory and discuss how the emerging complex synchronization patterns relate to the need for the brain to access in a robust though flexible way a large variety of functional attractors and dynamical repertoires without _ ad hoc _ fine - tuning to a critical point .    </S>",
    "<S> neuro - imaging techniques have allowed the reconstruction of structural human brain networks , composed of hundreds of neural regions and thousands of white - matter fiber interconnections . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting `` human connectome '' ( hc ) @xcite turns out to be organized in moduli characterized by a much larger intra than inter connectivity structured in a hierarchical nested fashion across many scales @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , `` functional '' connections between nodes in these networks have been empirically inferred from correlations in neural activity as detected in electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance time series . unveiling how structural and functional networks influence and constrain each other is a task of outmost importance . </S>",
    "<S> a few pioneering works found that the hierarchical - modular organization of structural brain networks has profound implications for neural dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , neural activity propagates in hierarchical networks in a rather distinctive way , not observed on simpler networks @xcite ; beside the usual two phases percolating and non - percolating commonly encountered in models of activity propagation , an intermediate `` griffiths phase '' @xcite emerges on the hierarchical hc network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a griffiths phase stems from the existence of highly diverse relatively - isolated moduli or `` rare regions '' where neural activity remains mostly localized generating slow dynamics and very large responses to perturbations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> brain function requires coordinated or coherent neural activity at a wide range of scales , thus , neural synchronization is a major theme in neuroscience @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> synchronization plays a key role in vision @xcite , memory @xcite , neural communication @xcite , and other cognitive functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an excess of synchrony results in pathologies such as epilepsy or parkinsonian disease , while neurological deficit of synchronization has been related to autism and schizophrenia @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to scrutinize the special features of synchronization dynamics @xcite as exemplified by the canonical kuramoto model @xcite running on top of the best available human connectome mapping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this consists of a network of @xmath0 nodes , each of them representing a mesoscopic population of neurons able to produce self - sustained oscillations @xcite whose mutual connections are encoded by a symmetric weighted connectivity matrix @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this admittedly simplistic kuramoto model as a convenient tool to explore the generic features of complex brain dynamics at a large scales has been recently emphasized in the literature @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we uncover the existence of a novel intermediate phase for synchronization dynamics similar in spirit to the griffiths phases discussed above which stems from the hierarchical modular organization of the hc and which gives rise to very complex and rich synchronization dynamical patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we identify this novel phase as the optimal regime for the brain to harbor complex behavior , large dynamical repertoires , and optimal trade - offs between local segregation and global integration .    </S>",
    "<S> the kuramoto dynamics on a generic network ( see @xcite for a nice and comprehensive review ) is defined by : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : kuramoto}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the phase at node @xmath4 at time @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic frequencies @xmath6 accounting for node heterogeneity are extracted from some arbitrary distribution function @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the elements of the @xmath9 connectivity matrix @xmath1 , and @xmath10 is the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> time delays , noise , and phase frustration could also be straightforwardly implemented . </S>",
    "<S> the kuramoto order parameter is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 gauges the overall coherence and @xmath13 is the average global phase . in large populations of well - connected oscillators without frequency dispersion , perfect coherence ( @xmath14 ) </S>",
    "<S> emerges for any coupling strength ; on the other hand , frequency heterogeneity leads to a phase transition at some critical value of @xmath10 , separating a coherent steady state from an incoherent one @xcite . analytical insight onto this phase transition can be obtained using the celebrated ott - antonsen ( oa ) ansatz , allowing for a projection of the high - dimensional dynamics into an evolution equation for @xmath15 with remarkable accuracy in the large-@xmath16 limit @xcite .    , for kuramoto dynamics on the hc network for a specific and fixed set of frequencies extracted from a @xmath17 gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a broad intermediate regime separates the incoherent phase ( low @xmath10 ) from the synchronous one ( high @xmath10 ) . in this regime </S>",
