    "[ fi : example ] shows a simple model of an electric car , modeled as a weighted timed automaton  @xcite . in the _ working _ state @xmath0 , energy is consumed at a rate of @xmath17 energy units per time unit ; in the two _ recharging _ states @xmath2 , @xmath4 , the battery is charged at a rate of @xmath18 , respectively @xmath17 , energy units per time unit . as the clock @xmath19 is reset ( @xmath8 ) when entering state @xmath0 and has guard @xmath20 on outgoing transitions , we ensure that the car always has to be in state @xmath0 for at least one time unit .",
    "similarly , the system can only transition back from states @xmath2 , @xmath4 to @xmath0 if it has spent at most one time unit in these states .",
    "passing between states @xmath0 and @xmath2 requires @xmath21 energy units , while transitioning between @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and between @xmath4 to @xmath2 , requires @xmath22 energy units . altogether ,",
    "this is intended to model the fact that there are two recharge stations available , one close to work but less powerful , and a more powerful one further away .",
    "now assume that the initial state @xmath0 is entered with a given _ initial energy _",
    "@xmath23 , then the energy problem of this model is as follows : does there exist an infinite trace which ( 1 ) visits @xmath0 infinitely often and ( 2 ) never has an energy level below @xmath24 ?",
    "this type of energy problems for weighted timed automata is treated in  @xcite , and using a reduction like in  @xcite , our model can be transformed to the _ energy automaton _ in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fi : example ] .",
    "( the reduction is quite complicated and only works for one - clock timed automata ; see  @xcite for details . )",
    "it can be shown that the energy problem for the original automaton is equivalent to the following problem in the energy automaton : given an initial energy @xmath23 , and updating the energy according to the transition label whenever taking a transition , does there exist an infinite run which visits @xmath0 infinitely often ?",
    "remark that the energy update on the transition from @xmath11 to @xmath0 is rather complex ( in the general case of @xmath25 recharge stations , the definition of @xmath13 can have up to @xmath25 branches ) , and that we need to impose a bchi condition to enforce visiting @xmath0 infinitely often .",
    "in this paper we propose a generalization of the energy automata of  @xcite which also encompasses most other approaches to energy problems . abstracting the properties of the transition update functions in our example , we define a general notion of _ energy functions _ which specify how weights change from one system state to another .",
    "noticing that our functional energy automata are semiring - weighted automata in the sense of  @xcite , we uncover a close connection between energy problems and reachability and bchi problems for weighted automata .",
    "more precisely , we show that one - dimensional energy problems can be naturally solved using matrix operations in semirings and semimodules  @xcite .    for reachability",
    ", we use only standard results  @xcite , but for bchi acceptance we have to extend previous work  @xcite as our semiring is not complete .",
    "we thus show that reachability and bchi acceptance are decidable for energy automata . for the class of _ piecewise affine _",
    "energy functions , which generalize the functions of fig .",

    "we show that the set of energy functions forms a star - continuous kleene algebra , a fact which allows us to give an elegant characterization of reachability in energy automata .",
    "we also expose a structure of conway semiring - semimodule pair over energy functions which permits to characterize bchi acceptance . in section  [ se :",
    "reach ] we use these characterizations to prove that reachability and bchi acceptance are decidable for energy automata .",
    "we also show that this result is applicable to most of the above - mentioned examples and give complexity bounds .",
    "to put our results in perspective , we generalize energy automata along several axes in section  [ se : multi ] and analyze these generalized reachability and bchi acceptance problems . _",

    "e.g. _  in  @xcite .",
    "our energy automata may hence be considered as a generalization of one - dimensional vass to arbitrary updates ; in the final section of this paper we will also be concerned with multi - dimensional energy automata and games .",
    "energy problems on _ timed automata _",
    "@xcite have been considered in  @xcite . here",
    "timed automata are enriched with integer weights in locations and on transitions ( the _ weighted timed automata _ of  @xcite , _ cf . _",
    "[ fi : example ] ) , with the semantics that the weight of a delay in a location is computed by multiplying the length of the delay by the location weight . in  @xcite it",
    "is shown that energy problems for one - clock weighted timed automata without updates on transitions ( hence only with weights in locations ) can be reduced to energy problems on integer - weighted automata with additive updates .    for one - clock weighted timed automata _ with _ transition updates ,",
    "energy problems are shown decidable in  @xcite , using a reduction to energy automata as we use them here .",
    "more precisely , each path in the timed automaton in which the clock is not reset is converted to an edge in an energy automaton , labeled with a _ piecewise affine _ energy function ( _ cf .",
    "_  definition  [ de : fpwint ] ) .",
    "decidability of the energy problem is then shown using ad - hoc arguments , but can easily be inferred from our general results in the present paper .",
    "also another class of energy problems on weighted timed automata is considered in  @xcite , in which weights during delays are increasing _ exponentially _ rather than linearly .",
    "these are shown decidable using a reduction to energy automata with _ piecewise polynomial _ energy functions ; again our present framework applies .",
    "we also remark that semigroups acting on a set , or more generally , semiring - semimodule pairs , have been used to describe the infinitary behavior of automata for a long time , see  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the infinitary product or omega operation is defined on the semiring and takes its values in the semimodule .",
    "another approach is studied _",
    "e.g. _  in  @xcite , where the omega operation maps the semiring into itself .",
    "it seems to the authors that there is no reasonable definition of an infinitary product or omega operation on energy functions that would again result in an energy function , hence we chose to use the framework of semiring - semimodule pairs .",
    "the transition labels on the energy automata which we consider in the paper , will be functions which model transformations of energy levels between system states .",
    "such transformations have the ( natural ) properties that below a certain energy level , the transition might be disabled ( not enough energy is available to perform the transition ) , and an increase in input energy always yields at least the same increase in output energy . thus the following definition .",
