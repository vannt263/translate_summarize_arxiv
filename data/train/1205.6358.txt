    "while qcd factorization methods are well established in the case of scattering observables involving a single large mass scale  @xcite , the treatment of processes with multiple mass scales is rather more subtle . in multi - scale processes ,",
    "generalized factorization formulas are required  @xcite if one is to control perturbative large logarithms to higher orders of perturbation theory and to describe appropriately nonperturbative physics in the initial and final states of the collision .",
    "such generalized factorization formulas typically involve transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) , or  unintegrated \" , parton distribution and parton decay functions  @xcite .",
    "a full treatment of factorization at unintegrated level , valid uniformly over the whole space , is yet to be achieved  @xcite .",
    "results however exist which apply in specific phase space regions .",
    "one such case is given by qcd in the high - energy , or small-@xmath0 , limit  @xcite , in which factorization of tmd gluon distributions holds  @xcite , in correspondence to perturbatively - resummed coefficient functions .",
    "results based on small-@xmath0 tmd distributions have for instance been used in analyses of inclusive observables such as deeply inelastic structure functions ( see  @xcite for a review ) and in monte carlo simulations of the exclusive structure of final states in hadronic collisions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "many aspects of the experimental program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) depend on the analysis of processes containing multiple hard scales , and will be influenced by improved formulations of factorization in qcd at unintegrated level . in this article",
    "we give a concise overview of recent progress on tmd distributions and their use for simulations of final states in hadronic collisions by shower monte carlo event generators .",
    "most of tmd computational tools have so far been developed within a quenched approximation in which only gluon and valence quark effects are taken into account at tmd level .",
    "we describe results of recent work  @xcite to go beyond this approximation by including sea quark effects , and we present first numerical applications to forward @xmath1-boson production .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we recall operator definitions for parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and basic issues associated with their tmd generalization . in sec .",

    "in this section we introduce the parton correlation functions used to define parton distributions . in subsec .",
    "2.1 we consider operator matrix elements for tmd distributions , and discuss current open issues , including lightcone divergences and factorization breaking effects . in subsec .",

    "the relevance of consistent operator definitions for parton k@xmath2 distributions was emphasized long ago in the context of sudakov processes  @xcite , jet physics  @xcite , exclusive production  @xcite , spin physics  @xcite .",
    "the approach commonly used to ensure gauge invariance is to generalize the coordinate - space matrix elements that define ordinary parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite to the case of field operators at non - lightcone distances .",
    "for instance , for the quark distribution one has ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmdop ] ) @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the quark fields evaluated at distance @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is in general nonzero , and @xmath7 are eikonal - line operators in direction @xmath8 , @xmath9 which we require to make the matrix element gauge - invariant .",

    "the lightcone singularity @xmath18 , corresponding to the exclusive boundary @xmath19 , cancels in this term , but it is present , even at @xmath20 and finite @xmath17 , in subsequent terms .",
    "these endpoint singularities come from gluon emission at large rapidity .",
    "they imply that , using the matrix element ( [ coomatrel ] ) , in momentum space the @xmath21 factors from real emission probabilities do not in general combine with virtual corrections to give @xmath22 distributions , but leave uncancelled divergences at fixed k@xmath2 .",
    "it is only after supplying the above matrix element with a regularization prescription that the distribution is well - defined .",

    "monte carlo event generators that make use of unintegrated pdfs also implement a cut - off .",

    "an alternative method is provided by the subtractive method  @xcite , in which the direction @xmath8 in eq .",

    "this method leads to well - prescribed counterterms  @xcite for the transverse momentum dependent splitting probabilities , which can be viewed as generalizing the plus - distribution regularization for @xmath26 . on one hand ,",
    "this approach has been used to relate the endpoint behavior at fixed k@xmath2 with the cusp anomalous dimension  @xcite and investigate the role of the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription in lightcone gauges . on the other hand",
    ", it can likely be more useful than the cut - off to untangle issues of factorization and non - universality  @xcite which arise beyond leading order , and investigate the relationship between evolution equations in rapidity and in virtuality  @xcite .",
    "infrared subtractions analogous to those in the method  @xcite are also discussed in the context of the soft - collinear effective theory  @xcite ( under the form , however , of counterterms that are not automatically gauge - invariant ) in the case of the sudakov form factor  @xcite and of initial - state beam functions  @xcite describing the incoming jet ( see also  @xcite ) .    as noted earlier",
    ", a full treatment of factorization at the level of tmd pdfs is yet to be achieved  @xcite . in the hadroproduction of nearly back - to - back hadrons",
    ", factorization is broken  @xcite by soft gluons exchanged between subgraphs in different collinear directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) .",
    "( see also the analyses  @xcite for the drell - yan case ) .",
    "the underlying dynamics is that of non - abelian coulomb phase  @xcite , involving interactions with spectator partons  @xcite ( which were treated long ago in  @xcite limited to the case of fully inclusive drell - yan ) .",
    "it was noted in  @xcite that the factorization - breaking contributions  @xcite are coulomb / radiative mixing terms related to the contributions  @xcite responsible for the appearance of super - leading logarithms in di - jet cross sections with a gap in rapidity .",
    "the issue of factorization depends on developing a systematic treatment , capable of handling overlapping divergences in infrared regions for complex observables that involve color charges in both initial and final states .",
    "this motivates the subtraction techniques quoted above , in the version  @xcite or in the scet version  @xcite .",
    "factorization involves in general , besides tmd pdfs , a nonperturbative soft factor , also characterized in terms of operator matrix elements , see  @xcite . the first paper in ref .",
    "@xcite analyzed the possibility of reabsorbing the soft factor into a redefinition of the tmd pdfs ( and analogous final - state fragmentation functions ) , using an explicit construction at one loop in the case of initial - state and final - state parton showers in dis .",
    "more recently , an explicit procedure to reabsorb the soft factor into redefined tmd pdfs has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of drell - yan .",
    "an analogous redefinition is implied by the drell - yan analyses in  @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen how generally this can be done .",
    "this will influence future programs of phenomenological determinations of tmd pdfs , see  @xcite .",
    "the case of back - to - back di - hadron or di - jet hadroproduction  @xcite illustrates that , due to the difficulty in disentangling soft and collinear gluon correlations between initial and final states , a general tmd factorization formula is still lacking . in the case of small @xmath0 , however , a tmd factorization result holds  @xcite owing to the dominance of single gluon helicity at high energy . in this case , a tmd gluon distribution can be defined gauge - invariantly from the high - energy pole in physical cross sections .",
    "see  @xcite for recent discussions of unintegrated pdfs based on small @xmath0 .",
    "the main reason why such a definition for tmd pdfs can be constructed in the high - energy limit is that one can relate directly ( up to perturbative corrections ) the cross section for a _ physical _ process , e.g. photoproduction of a heavy - quark pair  @xcite , to an unintegrated , transverse momentum dependent gluon distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disx - acta ] ) .",
    "this is quite like what one does for deeply inelastic scattering , in the conventional parton picture , in terms of ordinary ( integrated ) parton distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the difficulties in defining a tmd distribution in the general case , over the whole phase space , can be associated with the fact that it is not obvious how to determine one such relationship for general kinematics .",
    "the evolution equations obeyed by tmd distributions defined from the small-@xmath0 limit are evolution equations in energy  @xcite , with corrections down by logarithms of energy rather than powers of momentum transfer . using this evolution ,",
    "the high - energy factorization  @xcite can be related , order - by - order in @xmath27  @xcite , with the renormalization - group factorization  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to describe in this framework the ultraviolet region of arbitrarily high k@xmath2 , and in particular re - obtain the structure of qcd logarithmic scaling violations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the above observation justifies the use of this approach for hard production physics .",
    "in particular , it is the basis for using monte carlo implementations of transverse momentum dependent parton showers ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) to treat multi - scale hard processes at the lhc .",
    "parton - shower applications are discussed in sec .",
    "such applications have so far focused on tmd gluon distributions .",
    "ongoing work on the generalizations needed to include quark channels is discussed in sec .",
    "let us finally recall that extensions of the factorization results above are required if one is to take into account the nonlinear effects that are expected to arise in the small @xmath0 region from high parton densities .",
    "recent work in this direction , focusing on multiple scattering effects in dense targets and nuclei , may be found in  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "we note that techniques such as those in  @xcite have been proposed to incorporate the treatment of multiple - gluon rescattering graphs at small @xmath0 starting from the operator matrix elements  @xcite for parton distributions",
    ". they may thus be helpful for extensions to the high density region that are aimed at retaining accuracy also in the treatment of contributions from high p@xmath28 processes .",
    "in this section we move to applications of the tmd formalism to parton branching methods .",
    "the main role of tmd splitting functions and distributions in this context is that they serve to take into account coherence effects of multiple gluon radiation for small longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath0 in the initial state parton cascade . in subsec .",
    "3.1 we briefly recall the motivation for angular - ordered parton showers , and in subsec .",
    "3.2 we discuss the treatment of gluon coherence at small @xmath0 and corrections to angular ordering .",
    "branching algorithms in standard shower monte carlo generators  @xcite are based on collinear evolution of the jets , both time - like and space - like , developing from the hard event .",
    "the branching probability is given in terms of splitting functions @xmath29 and form factors @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pshower ] ) as @xmath31 the theoretical basis for the branching approach is the factorizability of universal splitting functions in qcd cross sections in the collinear limit  @xcite , which justifies the probabilistic picture .    besides small - angle , incoherent parton emission ,",
    "many of the current shower generators also take into account further radiative contributions from emission of soft gluons , which are essential for realistic phenomenology  @xcite . to incorporate these in a probabilistic framework , one appeals to properties of coherence of color radiation",
    "soft - gluon emission amplitudes factorize in terms of eikonal currents  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the emitters momenta , @xmath34 is the soft momentum , and the color charge operators @xmath35 are associated with the emission of gluon @xmath36 from parton @xmath37 . in general",

    "the reversed order of the emissions compared to case i ) reflects the fact that the radiated gluon sees the total color charge of the emitting jet .",
    "[ fig : colcoh]b illustrates that contributions of different emitters combine to give an effective contribution in which the emissions are ordered in angle , so that angular ordering  @xcite replaces energy ordering .    the above framework of collinear showering supplemented with phase space constraints designed to implement the angular ordering  @xcite forms the basis of standard shower monte carlo event generators .",
    "we next discuss the modifications of this framework that are required to treat parton showers at increasingly high energies .",
    "new effects arise if one is to extend the picture of the above subsection to the case of very high energies , where processes with multiple hard scales become significant .",

    "nevertheless , the results presented here , being the first implementation of small-@xmath0 sea - quark dynamics in a parton shower , constitute a starting point to include quark emissions systematically and to treat hard processes initiated by sea quarks on the same footing as processes initiated by gluons .",
