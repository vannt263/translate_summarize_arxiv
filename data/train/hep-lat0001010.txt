    "the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in two dimensions exhibits the first order phase transition for @xmath2 .",
    "many quantities@xcite was solved exactly at the phase transition point , among which the correlation length @xmath3 in the disordered phase @xcite is included .",
    "on the other hand , no analytic result had been known for the correlation length @xmath4 in the ordered phase at the phase transition point . here",
    "the correlation length means the standard one defined from the ratio of the largest to the second largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and it is often called the true correlation length or the exponential correlation length .",
    "janke and kappler@xcite examined the decay rate of the correlation function by the monte carlo simulation with large sizes of the lattice for @xmath5 and @xmath6 giving a result that was consistent with @xmath7 and they made a conjecture that this relation would be exact .",
    "igli and carlon@xcite evaluated the largest and the second largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix for @xmath8 by the density matrix renormalization group technique with a result that supports this conjecture . recently",
    "the author@xcite investigated analytically the large-@xmath0 behavior of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix .",
    "he found that from the second largest to the @xmath9-th largest eigenvalues with @xmath9 the size of the lattice make a continuum spectrum for the thermodynamic limit both in the ordered and disordered phases at least in the large-@xmath0 region and that @xmath10 at least to order @xmath11 ( i.e. , in the first 4 terms of the large-@xmath0 expansion ) .    here",
    "we calculate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the second moment correlation length @xmath12 at the first order phase transition point both in the ordered and disordered phases of this model .",
    "the second moment correlation length also gives important informations on the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix .",
    "the large-@xmath0 expansion of the potts model in two dimensions was calculated to order @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for the energy cumulants including the specific heat by bhattacharya , lacaze and morel@xcite using a graphical method .",
    "tabata and the author@xcite extended the large-@xmath0 series to order @xmath15 using the finite lattice method@xcite .",
    "they also calculated the large-@xmath0 series for the magnetization cumulants including the magnetic susceptibility to order @xmath16 .",
    "these long series enabled them to present the estimate for the numerical values of the cumulants which is orders of magnitude more precise than that of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the series also served to convince us that the correctness of the conjecture by bhattacharya , lacaze and morel on the behavior of the divergent quantities in the limit of @xmath17 .",
    "it is rather straightforward to apply the finite lattice method to the large-@xmath0 expansion of the second moment correlation length , since the algorithm is quite parallel with that of the finite lattice method for the low temperature expansion of the second moment correlation length for the ising model in three dimensions@xcite .",
    "the situation is in contrast to the case of the standard correlation length where the continuum spectrum of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix prevented us from applying the method used to obtain the low temperature series for the ising model in three dimensions@xcite .",
    "the results of the large-@xmath0 expansion for the second moment correlation length was reported breafly in reference@xcite and here we describe them in detail .",
    "the model is defined on the @xmath18 rectangular lattice by the partition function @xmath19 where the spin variable @xmath20 at each site @xmath21 takes the values @xmath22 , @xmath23 represents the pair of nearest neighbor sites and @xmath24 is the coordinate of the site @xmath21 .",
    "the phase transition point @xmath25 for @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the fixed boundary condition should be taken for the ordered phase in which all the spins outside the @xmath18 lattice are fixed to be @xmath28 , and the free boundary condition should be taken for the disordered phase .",
    "the second moment correlation length squared is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the second moment of the correlation function @xmath31 @xmath32 is the zeroth moment of the correlation function , i.e. , the magnetic susceptibility , and @xmath33 is the dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "the second moment @xmath30 can be obtained by the derivative of the free energy density as @xmath34    the algorithm of the finite lattice method to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion series for the second moment @xmath30 is the following .",
    "we define @xmath35 for each @xmath36 lattice ( @xmath37 ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the partition function for the @xmath36 lattice with the fixed and free boundary condition for the ordered and disordered phase , respectively , and define @xmath40 of each lattice recursively as @xmath41 note that @xmath35 and @xmath42 depend on the size @xmath43 and @xmath44 but not on the position of the origin of the coordinate .",
    "then the second moment of the correlation function in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath45    we can prove@xcite that the taylor expansion of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath14 includes the contribution from all the clusters of polymers in the standard cluster expansion@xcite that can be embedded into the @xmath36 lattice but can not be embedded into any of its rectangular @xmath46 sub - lattices with @xmath47 .",
    "it is straightforward to understand from the discussion for the large-@xmath0 expansion of the magnetic susceptibility in reference@xcite that the series expansion of @xmath42 starts from the order of @xmath48 with @xmath49 in the ordered phase and @xmath50 in the disordered phase , respectively .",
    "so in order to obtain the expansion series to order @xmath51 , we should take all the finite - size rectangular lattices for the summation in equation  ( [ eqn : b ] ) that satisfy @xmath52 in the ordered phase and @xmath53 in the disordered phase , respectively .    using these algorithm of the finite lattice method we have calculated the series for the second moment @xmath30 at the first order phase transition point to order @xmath54 in @xmath55 both in the ordered and disordered phases as @xmath56",
    "the coefficients of the series are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have checked that all of @xmath42 with @xmath53 for the ordered phase and with @xmath52 for the disordered phase have the correct order in @xmath55 as described above .    .",
    "the large-@xmath0 expansion coefficients @xmath57 for the second moment @xmath30 of the correlation function at @xmath58 in the ordered and disordered phases . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     another interesting and important quantity is the ratio of the second moment correlation length @xmath12 to the standard correlation length @xmath59 . from equation  ( [ eq : xisecasym ] ) we know that the ratio @xmath60 should be less than unity in the limit of the large correlation length . if the higher excited states ( @xmath61 ) did not contribute so much , this ratio would be close to unity , as is the case in the ising model on the simple cubic lattice , where @xmath62 at the critical point in the disordered phase @xcite .",
    "in figure 2 we plot the ratio @xmath60 for the potts model in the disordered phase .",
    "we use the value of @xmath12 estimated above from the pad analysis of @xmath63 and the exact value of @xmath59 .",
    "the ratio is much less than unity in the region of @xmath0 where the correlation length is large enough .",
    "it approaches @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this result implies that the contribution of the higher excited states is important in the potts model in two dimensions .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for the first excited state locates at the edge of the continuum spectrum of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix at least in the large-@xmath0 region and it strongly suggests that these excited states ( @xmath66 ) form a continuum spectrum not only in the large-@xmath0 region but also even in the limit of @xmath17 .",
    "we calculated the large-@xmath0 expansion of the second moment correlation length in the ordered and disordered phases of the @xmath0-state potts model in two dimensions and found that they coincide with each other to the third term of the expansion but differ a little from each other in higher orders .",
    "this suggests that , although the first few terms of the large-@xmath0 expansion for the standard correlation length really coincide in the ordered and disordered phases , their higher order terms might be different from each other .",
    "note , however , that it is not conclusive , since the second moment correlation length depends not only on the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix but also on the overlapping amplitude @xmath67 which appeared in equation  ( [ eq : xisecasym ] ) .",
    "numerically the ratio @xmath68 is not far from unity even in the limit of @xmath17 .",
    "we also found that @xmath69 is far from unity for all region of @xmath2 .",
    "it implies that higher excited states give significant contributions as well as the first excited state and it strongly suggests that these excited states form a continuum spectrum ( i.e. , there is no particle state in the language of the field theory ) not only in the large-@xmath0 region but also in all the region of @xmath2 .",
    "finally we point out that it is worthwhile to reanalyze the previous monte carlo data for the correlation function on the assumption that this would be the case .",
    "the author would like to thank w. janke , a. sokal and k. tabata for valuable discussions .",
