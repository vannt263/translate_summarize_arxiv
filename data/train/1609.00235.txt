    "today , remarkable parts of the physical , chemical , biological and medical communities as well as a broad spectrum of other scientists and engineers is interested in charge transfer ( ct ) in biological systems .",
    "ct is the basis of many biological processes e.g. in various proteins  @xcite including metalloproteins  @xcite and enzymes  @xcite , with medical and bioengineering applications @xcite .",
    "ct plays a central role in dna damage and repair @xcite .",
    "ct might also be an indicator to discriminate between pathogenic and non - pathogenic mutations at an early stage @xcite .",
    "dna plays a key role in the development , function and reproduction of living organisms , because the sequence of its bases ( adenine , guanine , thymine , cytosine ) carries their genetic code , hence , its study is usually associated with molecular biology and genetics .",
    "however , its remarkable properties have spurred in recent years the interest of a broad interdisciplinary community . from the perspective of physics , its electronic structure and its ct properties",
    "are studied with the aim of understanding its biological functions as well as its potential applications in nanotechnology ( e.g. nanosensors , nanocircuits , molecular wire ) .    at least for twenty years",
    ", we try to understand carrier movement through dna  @xcite .",
    "today , we know that many external factors related to the environment , like aqueousness and presence of counterions , extraction process , conduct quality with electrodes , purity , substrate and so on , influence carrier movement . this leads to the need of a deeper understanding of endogenous factors affecting carrier movement in dna , like base - pair sequence and geometry .",
    "maybe the most important endogenous factor is the base - pair sequence , to which this article is devoted , too .    additionally , we have to discriminate between the words _ transport _ ( usually implying the use of electrodes ) , _ transfer _ , and _ migration _ ( a transfer over rather long distances ) .",
    "the carriers ( electrons or holes ) can be either inserted via electrodes or generated by uv irradiation and by chemical reduction or oxidation . moreover , although unbiased charge transfer in dna nearly vanishes after 10 to 20 nm  @xcite , dna still remains a promising candidate as an electronic component in molecular electronics , e.g. as a short molecular wire  @xcite .",
    "favoring geometries and base - pair sequences have still to be explored e.g. incorporation of sequences serving as molecular rectifiers , using non - natural bases or using the triplet acceptor anthraquinone for hole injection  @xcite .",
    "structural fluctuations could be another important factor which influences quantum transport through dna molecular wires  @xcite .",
    "finally , the carrier transfer rate through dna can be manipulated by chemical modification  @xcite .",
    "on theoretical side , both _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite and model hamiltonians  @xcite try to interpret the diversity of experimental results and ascertain the underlying ct mechanism .",
    "the former can provide a more detailed description , but are currently limited to very short segments , while the latter are much less detailed but allowing to address systems of realistic length , grasping hopefully the underlying physics @xcite . here",
    "we study rather long b - dna segments , hence we adopt the latter approach .    specifically , we employ two tight - binding ( tb ) approaches .",
    "tb i is very simple , it is an approach at the base - pair ( bp ) level .",
    "we need the on - site energies of base pairs and the hopping integrals between successive base pairs . in other words , tb i is a _ wire _ model @xcite .",
    "tb ii is an approach at the single - base ( sb ) level .",
    "we need the on - site energies of bases and the hopping integrals between neighboring bases .",
    "we also include diagonal hoppings , in that sense , tb ii is an _ extended ladder _ model  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of diagonal hoppings is crucial in some cases as will become evident below . with these two tb models we study the electronic structure and hole or electron transfer in b - dna monomer polymers and dimer polymers",
    "this means that we call _ monomer _ a b - dna base pair and study polymers made of @xmath0 monomers , with repetition unit one or two monomers . to this end",
    ", we shall see below , we have to solve a system of @xmath1 ( `` matrix dimension '' ) coupled equations for the time - independent problem , and a system of @xmath1 coupled @xmath3 order differential equations for the time - dependent problem . in tb i @xmath1 = @xmath0 , while in tb ii @xmath1 = @xmath4 . in this article",
    ", we study homo and lumo eigenspectra and the relevant density of states ( dos ) as well as the mean over time probabilities to find the carrier at each site , which is a base pair for tb i and a base for tb ii .",
    "we are also interested in the frequency content of carrier movements , hence , we analyze the fourier spectra , too .",
    "the pure mean transfer rate from a certain site to another describes the easiness of ct ; it gives us a measure of how much of the carrier is transferred and also of how fast this process is .",
    "our two tb approaches give coherent , complementary aspects of electronic properties and charge transfer in these b - dna monomer polymers and dimer polymers .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] we delineate the basic theory behind the time - independent ( subsection  [ subsec : tiproblem ] ) and the time - dependent ( subsection  [ subsec : tdproblem ] ) problem . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss our results for eigenspectra and eigenvectors ( subsection  [ subsec : eigenspectravectors ] ) , the density of states ( subsection  [ subsec : dos ] ) , the homo - lumo gaps ( subsection  [ subsec : hlgaps ] ) , the mean over time probabilities to find the carrier at each site ( subsection  [ subsec : meanprobs ] ) , the ct frequency content ( subsection  [ subsec : frequencycontent ] ) , and the pure mean transfer rates ( subsection  [ subsec : meantransferrates ] ) . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we state our conclusions .",
    "let us begin with some notations .",
    "we call _ monomer _ a b - dna base pair .",
    "we denote a system of two successive monomers by yx , according to the convention @xmath5 for the b - dna strands orientation .",
    "x@xmath6 ( y@xmath6 ) is the complementary base of x ( y ) .",
    "the base pair x - x@xmath6 is separated and twisted by 3.4  and @xmath7 , respectively , relatively to the base pair y - y@xmath6 , around the b - dna growth axis .",
    "we call @xmath8 the monomer index , with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the strand index ( @xmath11 for the strand with @xmath12-@xmath13 directionality , @xmath14 for the strand with @xmath13-@xmath12 directionality ) .",
    "further , we define the base index @xmath15 , @xmath16 , according to the expression @xmath17 .",
    "schematically , @xmath18 in this work , we study all possible periodic b - dna segments of the form yxyx@xmath19 , consisting of @xmath0 monomers , i.e. , monomer polymers and dimer polymers .",
    "there are three types of such polymers : + ( type @xmath20 ) poly(dg)-poly(dc ) , poly(da)-poly(dt ) , + ( type @xmath21 ) gcgc  , cgcg ",

    "we employed two tight - binding approaches to examine time - independent and time - dependent aspects of the electronic structure and carrier transfer in b - dna monomer polymers ( type @xmath20 ) and dimer polymers ( type @xmath21 and type @xmath22 ) .",
    "we used a simplistic wire model ( tb i ) where a carrier is initially located at a base pair ( called also a monomer in this article ) and then moves to the next or to the previous base pair , as well as a more detailed extended ladder model ( tb ii ) where the carrier is initially located at a base and then moves to all possible neighboring bases including diagonally located ones .",
    "the inclusion of diagonal hoppings is crucial for type @xmath21 polymers where carrier transfer is mainly of inter - strand character .",
    "the time - dependent and the time - independent problems involve diagonalization of matrices with matrix dimension @xmath1 = @xmath0 for tb i and @xmath1 = @xmath4 for tb ii .",
    "the two tb approaches give coherent , complementary aspects of electronic properties and charge transfer in b - dna monomer polymers and dimer polymers .    for the time - independent problem",
    ", we studied the homo and the lumo eigenspectra and the occupation probabilities , the density of states and the homo - lumo gap .",
    "the upper ( lower ) subband of the homo ( lumo ) eigenspectrum calculated with tb ii corresponds to the band calculated with tb i. the occupation probabilities within tb i and tb ii show various degrees of palindromicity and eigenspectrum ( in)dependence of the probabilities to find the carrier at a site .",
    "the dos displays nice van hove singularities at the ( sub)band edges , while the numerically calculated dos for simple cases agrees with the analytical solution .",
    "as expected , the polymer homo - lumo gaps are smaller than the homo - lumo gaps of the two possible monomers , reaching a level of 3.4 to 3.0 ev . the smallest homo - lumo gaps occur for type @xmath22 polymers .    for the time - dependent problem we investigated the mean over time probabilities to find the carrier at each site ( base pair for tb i and base for tb ii ) , the fourier spectra and the pure mean transfer rates from a certain site to another .",
    "the mean over time probabilities illustrate clearly the basically intra - strand character of carrier transfer in type @xmath20 and type @xmath22 polymers .",
    "however , while in type @xmath20 polymers the carrier moves successively through all bases of the same strand , in type @xmath22 polymers the carrier moves through the bases that are identical with the one it was initially placed at , i.e. , it moves through the same strand from the one or the other base of the first monomer to the identical base of the third monomer , and so forth .",
    "carrier transfer is basically of inter - strand character in type @xmath21 polymers .",
    "the fourier spectra give us a nice representation of the frequency content of charge transfer .",
    "both tb approaches show that this frequency content is mainly in the thz domain , the details depend on the type of polymers and the tb approach used .",
    "the pure mean transfer rates @xmath58 show both how fast carrier transfer is and how much of the carrier is transferred from the initial site to the final site .",
    "the @xmath196 fits are considerably improved if polymers with @xmath0 odd and @xmath0 even are fitted separately . additionally , the power - law fits are generally better , in terms of correlation coefficients .",
    "our results confirm the statement that the fall of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath0 becomes generally steeper as the intricacy of the energy structure increases , i.e. , from type @xmath20 to type @xmath21 and further to type @xmath22 polymers .",
