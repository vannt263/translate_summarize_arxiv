    "magnetic neutron scattering ( mns ) in high temperature superconducting cuprates usually detects about @xmath1 of the spectral weight dictated by a naive application of sum rules . for example",
    "the total weight in a wide range of energy and momentum in a recent experiment@xcite in la@xmath2ba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , with @xmath5 , is @xmath6 whereas in the insulating phase the naive expectation from sum rules is that one should find @xmath7 .",
    "it is usually argued that this value should be corrected for the hole destruction of moments by a @xmath8 factor which still leaves a large fraction of spectral weight undetected .",
    "this rises various problems in the interpretation of mns .",
    "for example it has been argued that the average of the dynamical susceptibility weighted by the fourier transform of the magnetic interaction can be used to estimate the energy involved in magnetic pairing and its temperature dependence.@xcite clearly to obtain an absolute estimate the spectral weight problem needs to be sorted out first . furthermore modeling the dynamical structure factor probed by mns becomes rather problematic since sensible theoretical models",
    "do satisfy sum rules .",
    "indeed any theoretical claim of intensity agreement with the measured dynamical structure factor in absolute units needs to explain how the sum rule is satisfied or why it is violated .",
    "this is even more stringent in spin only models for which neither @xmath8 factors nor shielding corrections apply .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explain this apparent discrepancy .",
    "we provide theoretical estimates of the various factors which correct the sum rule and estimate what fraction of the spectral weight is accessible to present day experimental conditions .",
    "theoretical estimates are performed in the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase using the heisenberg and the hubbard model combining spin - wave theory , numerical results and the time dependent gutzwiller approximation ( tdga)@xcite and in the doped phase in the hubbard model within the tdga .",
    "apart from the mentioned @xmath8 factor we discuss the so called `` shielding factors '' due to an incomplete formation of magnetic moments .",
    "we estimate the spectral weight loss to electronic transitions at energies too high to be detectable by present day inelastic magnetic neutron scattering experiments and also the weight in multimagnon processes which is either at too high energies or is so broad in energy and momentum that it is not detectable in unpolarized neutron scattering experiments .",
    "after consideration of all these factors we arrive to the conclusion that within the experimental uncertainties the sum rule is not violated ( which is reassuring ) on the other hand a major fraction of the spectral weight is very hard to detect with present experimental conditions .",

    "the overall weight integrated up to energies immediately above the resonance is in agreement with the experimental one . as the energy increases there are strong deviations between theory and experiment .",
    "the simplest explanation for the smaller weight in the experiment is that some of the structures that contribute at high energy may be broad and assigned to the background ( see ref .  ) .",
    "we should say that because we neglect life - time effects even the sharp structures of our computation will be much broader in reality and this will be more important as the energy increases since , quite generally , the phase space for decay processes increases .",

    "in this work we have analyzed the distribution of spectral weight in neutron scattering experiments in cuprates .    in the insulator",
    "the spectral weight has been estimated in detail in the heisenberg model and then translated into a hubbard response with the use of an effective shielding factor .",
    "we find an effective shielding factor which essentially coincides with a proposal of hirsch and tang obtained by analyzing numerical data.@xcite in addition we have estimated , with the aid of the tdga , the weight at the energy of the charge transfer transitions .",
    "the inelastic longitudinal spectral weight at low energies is in broad features and thus hard to detect , although progress has recently been made.@xcite the transverse part has the well know quantum renormalized propagating spin wave modes which will be the features more accessible to experiment .",
    "theory and experiment agree well in the insulator .    for the doped phase we computed the dynamical response within the tdga .",
    "we considered metallic stripes but we expect our results for overall weights to be largely insensitive to the specific texture .",
    "one finds extra broad features due to the particle - hole continua plus propagating collective modes . in analogy with the insulator",
    "we expect the latter to be reduced in intensity due to quantum fluctuation and to dominate the spectral weight reported in experiments .",
    "our motivation was to understand why such a small fraction of the naively expected spectral weight is actually detected .",
    "we see that after taking into account all the reduction factors we passed from a weight which was an order of magnitude smaller than expected to a weight which is @xmath295 of that expected . given the uncertainties involved",
    "we think this value is reasonable .    by far",
    "the most important factor in reducing the detectable weight turns out to be the fact that a large fraction of the spectral weight is in broad features or at too high energies and this make the detection of the total spectral weight experimentally very challenging . in the doped phase a consistent fraction of the transverse spectral weight",
    "is predicted to lay at intermediate energies which may become accessible to experiment in a near future .",
