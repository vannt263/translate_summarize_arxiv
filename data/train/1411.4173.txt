    "@xcite , made a first attempt at laying the foundations for a theory of discrete - event ( and discrete - time ) stochastic processes that are governed by sets of , rather than single , probability measures .",
    "they showed how this can be done by connecting @xcite",
    "s @xcite theory of coherent lower previsions with ideas and results from @xcite s @xcite game - theoretic approach to probability theory . in later papers , applied these ideas to finite - state discrete - time markov chains , inspired by the work of @xcite .",
    "they showed how to perform efficient inferences in , and proved a perron  frobenius - like theorem for , so - called imprecise markov chains , which are finite - state discrete - time markov chains whose transition probabilities are imprecise , in the sense that they are only known to belong to a convex closed set of probability measures  typically due to partial assessments involving probabilistic inequalities .",
    "this work was later refined and extended by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the perron  frobenius - like theorems in these papers give equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for the uncertainty model  a set of probabilities  about the state @xmath0 to converge , for @xmath1 , to an uncertainty model that is independent of the uncertainty model for the initial state @xmath2 .    in markov chains with ` precise ' transition probabilities , this convergence behaviour is sufficient for a point - wise ergodic theorem to hold , namely that : @xmath3 for all real functions @xmath4 on the finite state set @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the limit expectation operator that the expectation operators @xmath7 for the state @xmath0 at time @xmath8 converge to point - wise , independently of the initial model @xmath9 for @xmath2 , according to the classical perron ",

    "* chapter  20 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the simpler version , but we will show that it can be extended to functions on a finite number of states . ]",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to extend this result to a version for imprecise markov chains ; see theorem  [ thm : point - wise : ergodic : theorem ] further on . in contradistinction with the so - called _ markov set - chains _ more commonly encountered in the literature  @xcite , our imprecise markov chains are not merely collections of ( precise ) markov chains  incidentally , for such markov set - chains , proving an ergodic theorem would be a fairly trivial affair , as it would amount to applying the classical point - wise ergodic theorem to each of the markov chains in the collection .",
    "rather , as we will explain in section  [ sec : markov ] , our imprecise markov chains correspond to a collection of stochastic processes that need not satisfy the markov property .",
    "they are only ` superficially markov ' , in the sense that their _ sets _ of transition probabilities satisfy a markov condition , whereas the individual members of those sets need not . in other words ,",
    "imprecise markov chains are _ not _ simply collections of precise markov chains , but rather correspond to collections of general stochastic processes whose transition models belong to sets that satisfy a markov condition .",
    "how do we mean to go about proving our ergodicity result ?",
    "in section  [ sec : ip ] , we explain what we mean by imprecise probability models : we extend the notion of an expectation operator to so - called lower ( and upper ) expectation operators , and explain how these can be associated with ( convex and closed ) sets of expectation operators",
    ".    in section  [ sec : processes ] , we explain how these generalised uncertainty models can be combined with event trees to form so - called imprecise probability trees , to produce a simple theory of discrete - time stochastic processes .",
    "we show in particular how to combine local uncertainty models associated with the nodes in the tree into global uncertainty models ( global conditional lower expectations ) about the paths in the tree , and how this procedure is related to sub- and supermartingales .",
    "we also indicate how it extends and subsumes the ( precise-)probabilistic approach .",
    "in section  [ sec : large : numbers ] we prove a very general strong law of large numbers for submartingale differences in our imprecise probability trees .",
    "our point - wise ergodic theorem will turn out to be a consequence of this in the particular context of imprecise markov chains .",
    "section  [ sec : properties : of : global : models ] is more technical , and is devoted to extending the joint lower and upper expectations to extended real variables , and to proving a number of important properties for them , such as generalisations of well - known coherence properties , and a version of the law of iterated ( lower ) expectations .",
    "we explain what imprecise markov chains are in section  [ sec : markov ] : how they are special cases of imprecise probability trees , how to do efficient inference for them , and how to define perron ",
    "frobenius - like behaviour .",
    "we generalise existing results  @xcite about global lower expectations in such imprecise markov trees from a finite to an infinite time horizon , and from bounded real argument functions to extended real - valued ones .",
    "we also explore the influence of time shifts on the global ( conditional ) lower expectations , investigate their markov properties , prove various corollaries of the law of iterated lower expectations , and discuss stationarity and its relation with perron  frobenius - like behaviour . as an illustration of the power of our approach , we derive in section  [ sec : transition : and : return : times ] a system of non - linear equations for lower and upper expected transition and return times , and solve it in special case .",
    "in section  [ sec : interesting : equality ] we show that there is an interesting identity between the time averages that appear in our strong law of large numbers , and the ones that appear in the point - wise ergodic theorem .",
    "the discussion in section  [ sec : perron : frobenius ] first focusses on a number of terms in this identity , and investigates their convergence for perron  frobenius - like imprecise markov chains .",
    "this allows us to use the identity to prove two versions of the point - wise ergodic theorem : one for functions of a single state ( theorem  [ thm : point - wise : ergodic : theorem ] ) and its extension ( corollary  [ cor : point - wise : ergodic : theorem ] ) to functions of a finite number of states .",
    "we briefly discuss their significance in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "some of the results in this paper have already been discussed  without proofs  in an earlier conference version @xcite .",
    "this paper significantly extends the earlier version .",
