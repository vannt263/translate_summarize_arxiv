    "photoluminescence ( pl ) of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) has been intensively studied for elucidating their unusual optical and electronic properties due to one dimensionality @xcite .",
    "since both of electron - electron repulsion and electron - hole binding energies for swnts are considerably large compared with those for conventional three - dimensional materials , the coulomb interactions between electron - electron and electron - hole play an important role in optical transition of swnts @xcite .",
    "optical transition energies of swnts are strongly affected by the change of environment around swnts such as bundling @xcite , surfactant suspension @xcite and dna wrapping @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the transition energies for suspended swnts between two pillars fabricated by the mems technique are blue - shifted relative to the transition energies for micelle - suspended swnts .",
    "_ @xcite have compared the pl of suspended swnts directly grown on a grated quartz substrate using alcohol cvd technique @xcite with sds - wrapped swnts @xcite .",
    "the energy differences between air - suspended and sds - wrapped swnts depend on @xmath1 and type of swnts [ type i ( @xmath2 mod 3 = 1 ) or type ii ( @xmath2 mod 3 = 2)@xcite ] .",

    "_ studied @xmath3 transition energies of swnts in various surrounding materials with different dielectric constant , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "observed dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 for a @xmath5 nanotube showed a tendency that can be roughly expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes a transition energy when @xmath8 is infinity , @xmath9 is the maximum value of an energy change of @xmath3 by @xmath4 , and @xmath10 is a fitting coefficient in the order of 1 , respectively . at this stage ,",
    "the reason why the experimental curve follows eq.([eq : e11alpha ] ) is not clear .    in the previous theoretical studies of excitonic transition energies for swnts @xcite , a screening effect of a surrounding material",
    "is mainly described using a static dielectric constant @xmath11 . however , since @xmath11 consists of both @xmath4 and screening effect by nanotube itself , @xmath12 , experimental dependence of transition energies on dielectric constants of environment can not directly compared with calculations @xcite using the static dielectric constant @xmath11 . in this study",
    ", we make a simple model for the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath11 .",

    ", the photon - excited exciton is an exciton with @xmath28 for parallel excitations to the nanotube axis . in this letter",
    ", we calculate the @xmath29 state of @xmath30 exciton for each @xmath5 swnt .      in our calculation",
    ", the unscreened coulomb potential @xmath31 between carbon @xmath32 orbitals is modeled by the ohno potential @xcite .",
    "we consider the dielectric screening effect within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . in the rpa ,",
    "the static screened coulomb interaction @xmath33 is expressed as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dielectric function describing effects of the polarization of the @xmath32 bands .",
    "@xmath11 is a static dielectric constant describing the effects of electrons in core states , @xmath0 bonds , and surrounding materials . in the calculation , we directly calculate only the polarization for the @xmath32 band , and the effects of electrons in core states , @xmath0 bands , and surrounding materials are represented by a single constant @xmath11 . in the most accurate expression , the inhomogeneous and nonlocal dielectric response of the nanotube itself and the surrounding materials should be considered .",
    "however , it is not easy within extended tight binding method . in this study , instead of treating the complicated dielectric response including surrounding materials , we make a simple model for a relation between the static dielectric constant @xmath11 and @xmath4 to obtain the @xmath3 dependence on @xmath4 .     and the dielectric constant of the surrounding material @xmath4 and the nanotube itself @xmath12,width=226 ]    .

    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows a schematic view for the model relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "here we consider the screening effect related to @xmath11 as a linear combination of the screening of nanotube itself and the surrounding material @xmath36 where @xmath12 is the dielectric constant within a nanotube except for the @xmath32 bands , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are coefficients for the inside and outside of a nanotube , respectively . as shown in eq.([eq : e11alpha ] ) , the transition energies observed in the experiment @xcite indicate that there is a limit value @xcite when @xmath4 @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "hence , when @xmath4 @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 can be removed from eq.([eq : kapp - rel ] ) , and @xmath42 is expressed by the limit value as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the limit value of the net dielectric constant @xmath11 when @xmath4 is infinity . since electric flux lines through inside of the nanotube remain even when @xmath4 @xmath39 @xmath40 , we assume there is a certain value of @xmath11 ( @xmath44 ) that corresponds to the situation when dielectric screening by surrounding material is perfect and only dielectric response of the nanotube itself contributes to the net screening effect .    replacing @xmath45 by @xmath46 , eq.([eq : kapp - rel ] ) is modified as @xmath47 next , we imagine that the swnt is placed in the vacuum , which corresponds to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and then @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the static dielectric constant _ not _ for the vacuum , but for the situation that the nanotube is placed in the vacuum .",
    "we now express @xmath11 as a function of @xmath8 through two parameters @xmath44 and @xmath51 , whose values can be estimated from the following discussions . in the previous papers @xcite , @xmath11 value",
    "is put around 2 to obtain a good fit with experiments for swnts with surrounding materials .",
    "_ @xcite have compared the calculated results with the results for the two photon absorption experiments @xcite , and obtained the best fit using @xmath52 for swnts in a polymer matrix . here ,",
    "since @xmath51 is for nanotubes without surrounding materials , @xmath51 should be less than about 2 and close to 1 due to vacancy of inside of the tubes .",
    "with regard to @xmath44 , according to the experimental results @xcite , transition energy change due to change of surrounding materials is at most 30 - 100mev .",
    "fig.[fig:2](a ) shows the calculated @xmath3 energy dependence on @xmath11 for a ( 9,8 ) swnt in a small @xmath11 region , while the inset shows the @xmath3 dependence up to @xmath53 . as shown in fig.[fig:2](a ) , variation of @xmath11 that yields the transition energy change of 30 to 100 mev is about 1 to 3 when @xmath11 is around 2 .",

    "this is mainly due to the fact that the self energy ( e - e repulsion ) always exceeds to the e - h binding energy and that the both interactions ( e - e and e - h ) decrease with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath3 almost linearly depends on @xmath11 around the small @xmath11 region .",
    "we checked that the linear dependence is universal for all @xmath5 s for diameters more than 0.7 nm . assuming the linear dependence , variation of the excitation energy @xmath60 for the small @xmath11 region is approximated by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the gradient of @xmath63 near the small @xmath11 region for each @xmath5 type .",
    "after we transform @xmath11 using the relationship of eq.([eq : kapp - rel ] ) , eq.([eq : keffdep ] ) is modified as @xmath64    @xmath65 corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath63 when @xmath4 @xmath39 @xmath40 , which corresponds to the value of coefficient @xmath9 in the fitting curve of eq.([eq : e11alpha ] ) . for @xmath54 swnt ,",

    ", here we roughly estimate the @xmath85 as a simple function of diameter @xmath83 , since @xmath74 should depend on the cross section of a swnt . as shown in fig.[fig:3](b ) , @xmath85 is roughly proportional to @xmath75 , @xmath86 with the coefficient @xmath87 @xmath88 . here",

    "details of experimental data will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although our treatment is very simple , the calculated curves for various @xmath5 swnts well reproduce the experimentally observed tendency for each @xmath5 swnt , and the degree of difference between each @xmath5 type is also in good agreement with the experiment . as shown in fig.[fig:4](c ) , @xmath93 is in a good agreement with @xmath94 except for several points indicated by a dotted circle in the figure , which correspond to a case for the smallest @xmath92 ( hexane ) except for @xmath49 ( air ) in the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath92 for hexane is adopted as the dielectric constant for the material , in which the dipole moments of liquid hexane are not aligned perfectly even in the presence of the electric field .",
    "since @xmath92 is a macroscopic value , a local dielectric response might be different from the averaged macroscopic response .",
    "if the local dielectric constant near swnts becomes large ( for example , @xmath95 ) , the fitting of fig.[fig:4](c ) becomes better .",
    "we expect that the dipole moments of a dielectric material might be aligned locally for a strong electric field near an exciton , which makes the local dielectric constant relatively large .",
    "this will be an interesting subject for exciton pl physics .",
    "since the difference of @xmath66 between each @xmath5 type decreases with increasing the diameter , it is predicted that the amount of variation due to the change of @xmath4 mostly depend on diameter in the larger diameter range .",
    "thus a pl experiment for nanotubes with large diameters would be desirable for a further comparison .",
    "in summary , the dependence of exciton transition energies on dielectric constant of surrounding materials are investigated .",
    "we proposed a model for the relation between dielectric constant of the environment and a static dielectric constant @xmath11 in the calculation .",
