    "as was shown in a number of papers , see refs . @xcite and references therein , the study of the radiative decays @xmath4 and @xmath7 can shed light on the problem of the scalar @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "present time data have already been obtained from novosibirsk with the detectors snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite , which give the following branching ratios : @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite",
    ".    these data give evidence in favor of the four - quark @xmath14 @xcite nature of the scalar @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , and in favor of the one - loop mechanism @xmath15 and @xmath16 , suggested in ref.@xcite , see fig.[loop ] .",
    "it is clear that the relative sign between the final state radiation amplitude , and the @xmath17 amplitude in the @xmath2 loop model is fixed , see figs .",
    "[ loop ] and [ diagrams - phi ] . as a consequence",
    "this model predicts the definite interference between the final state radiation amplitude and the scalar resonance production . that is why the study of the @xmath0 decay is very important .",
    "such an investigation requires high statistics .",
    "it can be carried out in the @xmath18 reactions at jefferson laboratory and in the @xmath19 reaction at da@xmath20ne .",
    "note that if the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons mixing is taken into account in the @xmath23 reaction then the interference sign is not fixed .",
    "but the influence of the @xmath22 meson on the signal is small and it is considered as a correction to the interference term .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 spectra and the differential cross - sections for @xmath19 , using parameters of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons from ref.@xcite which describe the @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays , and show that the contribution of the interference between the scalar resonance production and the final state radiation is order of magnitude more than the contribution of the scalar resonance production .",
    "that is the reason that today s facilities give the good capabilities to investigate our issue .",
    "we also calculate the differential cross section for @xmath6 which is very important for the determination of the background affecting the precision measurements of cp violation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "all needed formulae are considered in sec .",
    "ii . in sec",
    "iii the calculations are carried out and the obtained results are discussed .",
    "a brief summary is given in conclusion .",
    "notice that ref .",
    "@xcite was dedicated to the @xmath26 reactions at the @xmath27 meson region .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered mistakenly that the relative sign between the final state radiation amplitude and the @xmath28 amplitude is not fixed in the @xmath2 loop model .",
    "in addition , they took parameters of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons a priori to a large measure .",
    "let us consider the production of the scalar @xmath29 meson through the loop of the charged @xmath30 mesons , @xmath31 , see @xcite .",
    "the diagrams are presented in fig.[loop ] .",
    "the production amplitude @xmath32 in the rest frame of the @xmath27 meson is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the polarization vectors of the @xmath27 meson and the photon respectively .",
    "the expressions for @xmath37 were obtained in the point - like particle model , which is adequate to the compact hadrons : the four - quark @xmath38 or @xmath39 states @xcite and in the extended scalar @xmath40 molecule model @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the decay @xmath41 , i.e. , the signal amplitude , is @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the mass spectrum : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angle between the photon and the @xmath46 meson momenta in the dikaon rest frame .",
    "we consider also the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons mixing . in this case",
    "the amplitude is @xmath47 where we take into account the mixing of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons , @xmath48 by means of the matrix of the inverse propagators @xmath49 .",
    "the all necessary expressions could be found in @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum in this case is @xmath50 .",
    "the amplitude of the process is @xmath51 the mass spectrum is @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "we identify @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 for convenience .",
    "the interference between the amplitudes ( [ amplituda-0 ] ) and ( [ fon-0 ] ) gives the expression @xmath57\\times \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\times\\biggl\\{v(x)+\\frac{\\xi}{2}\\ln\\frac{1-v(x)}{1+v(x)}\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the decay @xmath58 , due to the destructive interference between the @xmath59 and @xmath21 mesons , we have the following expressions @xmath60 , see fig.[diagrams - ee ] .",
    "the amplitude of the reaction is @xmath61 the differential cross - section is @xmath62 the coupling constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 are related to the widths in the following way :    @xmath65    we introduce two symmetrical angle cuts : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the angle between the photon momentum and the electron beam in the center of mass frame of the reaction under consideration and @xmath68 , where @xmath45 is the angle between the photon and the @xmath46 meson momenta in the dikaon rest frame .",
    "notice that the kaons are slow in our case , @xmath69 , which is why @xmath45 angle cut practically does not change the results ( at @xmath70 changes are within 13% ) in contrast to the pion production @xcite .",
    "the basic background to the process under study has came from the initial electron radiation ( see fig.[diagrams - ee]c ) and the radiation from the final kaons ( fig.[diagrams - ee]b ) .",
    "the initial state radiation does not interfere with the final state radiation and with the signal in the differential cross section integrated over all angles since the charged kaons are in the c=-1 state .",
    "this is true also when the angle cuts are symmetrical .    introducing the symmetrical angle cuts considerably decreases the background from the initial state radiation because of the photons in this case",
    "are emitted along the beams mainly .",
    "let us consider the background related to the final state radiation .",
    "the amplitude of the process is @xmath71    it is convenient to give the differential cross section in the form @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the nonradiative cross section @xmath74 is : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .    the interference between the amplitudes from eqs .",

    "@xmath78 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    evaluating @xmath79 we ignored the electron mass .",

    "in the @xmath95 model of the scalar particle and in the model of the @xmath40 molecule the @xmath21 and @xmath59 mesons are strongly coupled with the @xmath40 channel under threshold of which they are .",
    "the ordinary resonance expression of the propagator , in view of it , is changed considerably and the account of @xmath96 $ ] corrections is necessary .",

    "[ spectr11 ] , using the constants obtained from our fitting of the snd data @xcite :    @xmath114    and @xmath115    the branching ratio of the final state radiation decay @xmath0 is @xmath116 . for the pure signal",
    "we have @xmath117 and for the signal plus interference term we have @xmath118 . for comparison ,",
    "the branching ratio for the @xmath119 , for this set of parameters is equal @xmath120 .    on fig .",

    "the branching ratio for the @xmath119 , for this set of parameters is equal @xmath125 .",
    "it is seen from our analysis that the pictures are the same qualitatively for the both sets of parameters but the branching ratio for the signal plus interference is predicted to within 1.5 and the branching ratio for the pure signal is predicted to within 2.5 .",
    "so , the analysis tells us that the research of the decays @xmath0 in the processes @xmath5 and @xmath126 is the real problem that could be investigated in novosibirsk at vepp-2000 , in frascati at dafne , and in newport news at jefferson laboratory .",
    "this research could give much information about the inner structure of the @xmath59 and @xmath21 mesons and allow to check the hypothesis of considerable @xmath127 part in the @xmath59 and @xmath21 mesons .",
