    "molecular simulation is becoming an increasingly popular tool for the investigation of mechanical and thermo - mechanical properties of polymer materials .",

    "they allow for an investigation of qualitative and quantitative issues not directly accessible to experiments , while remaining affordable in terms of computational costs .",
    "investigating structure - property relations in polymeric systems , however , requires the preparation of equilibrated melts with long and entangled chains . above the glass transition , equilibrium can , in principle , be achieved using long molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the situation gets difficult for long chains with relaxation times that can soon exceed the typical simulation duration of a few nanoseconds , and for nanostructured polymers ( e.g. block copolymers ) , where equilibration times , even for short chains , are too long to use md or mc to produce equilibrated melts .    for long polymer chains , hybrid methods combining md and mc in particular the so called `` double bridging '' algorithm @xcite ,",
    "have been used to generate well equilibrated melts .",
    "these algorithms , apart from their technical complexity , are not particularly well suited for extension to more complex architectures .",
    "the objective of our contribution is to propose an innovative method for polymer chain generation , ( i ) based on a realistic approach close to radical polymerisation@xcite ; ( ii ) particularly adapted to generate non linear architectures ( branched polymers , star polymers , copolymers , ... ) and/or polydisperse chains ; ( iii ) providing equilibrated melts .",
    "this method , called _ `` radical - like polymerization '' _ will be tested on different system types ( mono- and poly - disperse homopolymers ) .",
    "it will be also compared to more classical _ push off _",
    "methods @xcite , which are based on a two steps process : ( i ) random gaussian chain generation and ( ii ) equilibration .",
    "systems resulting from step ( i ) are usually quite far from equilibrium as chains interactions are not taken into account , requiring thus long equilibration times ( step ( ii ) ) .    the main idea of _ radical - like polymerisation _",
    ", is that chains are partially relaxed * simultaneously * while polymerization is achieved .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : technical ] describes the method . in section [ sec : results ] , we apply the method to several types of homopolymer melts , and show how it can be tuned to obtained well equilibrated melts at a relatively low computational cost .",
    "finally , we point out that the _ radical - like polymerization method _ is suitable for simulating block copolymers , and give a preliminary illustration of this in section [ sec : copo ] .",
    "our simulations are carried out for a well established coarse - grained model @xcite in which the polymer is treated as a chain of @xmath0 beads ( where @xmath1 denotes the species for block copolymers ) , which we refer to as monomers , of mass @xmath2 connected by a spring to form a linear chain .",

    "the pressure is fixed to @xmath15        the _ radical - like _ polymerization method is directly inspired by the classical polymerization phenomenon with a protocol based on three stages :    * _ starting : _ a radical ( active molecule that interacts with monomers ) is created by an active molecule @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and interacts with a first monomer @xmath18 , * _ propagation : _ the radical captures a new monomer and moves to the chain end @xmath19 * _ termination : _ four main mechanisms of termination can usually be identified in polymerization reactors : ( i ) two radicals can annihilate leading to two separated polymer chains ( @xmath20 ) ( _ disproportination _ ) ; ( ii ) two radicals can annihilate leading to one polymer chain ( @xmath21 ) ( _ coupling _ ) ; ( iii ) a radical can be transferred to another monomer leading to a new growing chain ( _ transfert _ ) or annihilated by some defect .",
    "radicals can also remain active and chain growth is stopped only when all monomers have been consumed , as in ( _ living polymerization _ ) .",

    "the order - disorder transition temperature is governed by the product of @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the flory - huggins temperature - dependant interaction parameter characterizing the ab incompatibility .",
    "symmetric diblock copolymers are homogeneous at small @xmath135 value , but strongly heterogeneous with ordered structure when @xmath137 exceeds , in mean - field theory , the critical order - disorder transition value @xmath138 .",
    "hence , as a first application of our _ radical - like copolymerization _ algorithm , we simulated such diblock copolymers in the two limiting case of weak segregation limit with @xmath113 ( ( @xmath139 ) , and the strong one , with @xmath112 ( @xmath140 ) .    to observe box dilatation and inter - lamellae distance relaxation , an anisotropic nos - hoover barostat has been used during @xmath141 md steps , in such a way that @xmath142 , while the temperature was fixed to @xmath143 .",
    "snapshots of diblock configurations are shown in fig .",

    "[ dibloc_vs_chin ] , one can observe that the interface separating the two blocks is well defined and stable , as expected in the strong segregation limit . on the contrary , in the right panel ,",
    "the same interface is poorly defined and appears to be unstable on the simulation timescale .",
    "one expects the diblock to become homogeneous in the long time limit .",
    "this preliminary study on diblock copolymers allowed us to validate the _ radical - like _ copolymerization technics .",
    "the advantage of this technique resides in the control of the geometry of simulated copolymers , as well as the possibility to generate in a flexible way configurations with various topologies and chain architectures .",
    "the _ radical - like _ polymer chains generation method is inspired by radical polymerisation in which the reactive center of a polymer chain consists of a radical .",
    "the free radical reaction mechanism can be divided in to three stages : ( i ) initiation ( creation of free radicals ) ; ( ii ) propagation ( construction of the repeating chain ) : ( iii ) termination ( radical is no longer active ) .",
    "2 .   performing an relatively important number of md relaxation steps between each growth step ( typically 300 ) leads to well equilibrated chains ( in terms of gyration radii , mean square internal distance , and primitive path analysis ) , even for relatively short relaxation stage ( @xmath128 md steps ) .",
    "the main advantage of the radical - like generation algorithm is that equilibration occurs simultaneously as chain growth , within a coarse grained molecular dynamics scheme .",
    "polymer melts generated with the radical - like algorithm are as well equilibrated as melts generated by more classical methods ( like fast push - off ) . 5 .   the radical - like generation method is particularly adapted to generate polydisperse polymer melts ( branched polymers , star polymers , copolymers , ... ) .",
    "nano - structured lamellar block copolymers have been successfully generated with the radical - like method .",
    "7 .   physical and mechanical properties of di - block and tri - block copolymers generated using this algorithm , will be the subject of a futur paper .",
