    "this may be easily seen by having a look to the typical energy scale of the perturbation @xmath206 ( for the example of fig .",
    "3b of the letter ) , which leads to a damping time scale of the order of @xmath207 , which is what one observes in the numerics .",
    "summarizing , the system behaves indeed as a mqs - splitter .",
    "second - order processes ( due to single - particle tunnelings to the left for right moving states , or viceversa for left - moving states ) lead to a damping of the josephson oscillations , and hence induce a complex and rich dynamics for the mqss .",
    "this has important practical consequences , e.g. there are optimum times for the interferometric measurements ( see below ) .",

    "moreover , due to the ( effective ) repulsion between sites @xmath92 and @xmath137 , @xmath137 may be only populated once @xmath92 is empty .",

    "<S> the three - well system hence acts as a _ mqs - splitter _ under the mentioned conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we stress , however , that a mqs ( although asymmetric ) is still created  @xcite , even for unequal hoppings @xmath129 for nearest neighbors , as long as @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> we note also that if @xmath131 a mqs is created if @xmath132 , but nearest - neighbor interactions enhance the damping in each mqs branch . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath133 bosons at site @xmath92 remain self - trapped .     </S>",
    "<S> ( dashed ) , @xmath134 ( solid ) , for @xmath135 and @xmath69 ; ( b ) probability @xmath136 as a function of @xmath16 for the interferometric @xmath137-site arrangement ( see text ) with @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140.,width=264 ]    the mqs - splitter opens fascinating possibilities beyond the @xmath94-well system , most relevantly in the context of heisenberg - limited atom interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this possibility by considering a simple interferometer based on a four - well system ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> initially the bosons are at site @xmath92 ( which acts as the input port ) . </S>",
    "<S> sites @xmath93 and @xmath94 play the role of the interferometer arms , whereas site @xmath137 acts as the output port , where the interferometric signal is read out . </S>",
    "<S> we consider hoppings @xmath141 , but @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the @xmath16-sensitivity of the population at site @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement is chosen for its theoretical simplicity ( more general arrangements work along similar lines ) , although it may be implemented also in practice by means of raman - tunneling  @xcite . under the mqs conditions ( in this case @xmath108 and @xmath143 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the system evolves into an entangled mqs formed by fock states such that @xmath144 for next - nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the probability to find @xmath6 particles at site @xmath137 depends explicitly on the phase @xmath16 as @xmath145 ( @xmath146 are only indirectly @xmath16-dependent due to normalization ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath136 has a modulation of period @xmath147 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3p]b ) , contrary to the period @xmath148 expected for independent single particles , allowing for a heisenberg - limited interferometric measurement of the phase @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this super - resolution is an unambiguous signature of the coherent character of the mqs thus created  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath149 presents a similar modulation ( but with poorer contrast ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculations with a six - site arrangement provide similar results  @xcite .    in the final part of this letter we discuss experimental feasibility . </S>",
    "<S> triple - well potentials as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] may be controllably implemented with optical potentials . by superimposing , onto a single - beam optical trap which provides the @xmath150-confinement , </S>",
    "<S> a tightly focused beam ( with a waist @xmath151 m , see e.g.  @xcite ) , one may create a tight ` dimple ' acting as one well . to realize a triple - well ( or even more complex configurations ) , several possibilities exist . using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) with several rf frequencies  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> several diffracted beams are created , whose intensity and position can be controlled independently . </S>",
    "<S> another option using an aom consists in toggling the dimple between several positions at high rate , to create almost arbitrary time - averaged potentials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an implementation has several advantages : arbitrary , time - dependent energy offsets can be applied to the different sites ; the inter - site separation @xmath9 can be changed in real time , easing the preparation of a given atom number in each well ( e.g. by performing evaporative cooling with different energy offsets in each site ) , and the detection of the population in each well ( before imaging , @xmath10 may be increased to freeze out the dynamics and then @xmath9 increased , thus relaxing constraints on the imaging resolution ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now evaluate @xmath152 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for realistic experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> although in our calculations we have just considered @xmath6 up to @xmath153 , similar ground - states are expected for larger @xmath6 ( but , as mentioned above , the observation of the quantum features at the ( b)(c ) and ( d)(c ) boundaries demands small samples ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , consider a triple - well potential formed by three gaussian beams of waist @xmath154 separated by @xmath155 m . </S>",
    "<S> for a barrier height @xmath156  hz , we obtain @xmath157  hz , and the typical value of @xmath158 is then @xmath159 for @xmath160 @xmath1cr atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath41 can be tuned , for a fixed geometry , by means of feshbach resonances  @xcite , so that one can explore e.g. the first - order ( b)(c ) `` transition '' with @xmath1cr by varying @xmath161 . however , the mqs creation demands small samples , being hence more realistic with polar molecules . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for krb molecules placed at a distance @xmath162 m and maximally polarized ( @xmath163  d ) parallel to the joining line between the sites , @xmath164hz . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> the mqs condition implies , for @xmath165 molecules , @xmath166 of a few hz . </S>",
    "<S> single - atom sensitivity has been achieved with fluorescence imaging  @xcite , so that the relatively small values of @xmath6 considered here should be detectable .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied a simple system of dipolar bosons in a triple well , showing that the non - locality of the ddi leads to _ qualitatively _ novel physics that may be explored with a high degree of control over all parameters via the trap geometry , dipole orientation , and feshbach resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the ground - state phases present abrupt crossovers induced by the non - local nature of the ddi , which may be explored with @xmath1cr becs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the dynamics presents intriguing new scenarios , especially for the case of polar molecules , including the dynamical creation of mqss , which may be employed for heisenberg - limited interferometry .    </S>",
