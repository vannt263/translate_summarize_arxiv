    "in recent years we witnessed rapid progress in the developement of techniques for the computation of higher order corrections in perturbative quantum field theory . while other talks at this conference cover progress in the computation of entire amplitudes , our talk refers to the classical approach of computing the amplitude by its feynman graphs , which is inevitable when meeting the needs of present collider experiments . in this field of research",
    ", it has shown to be fruitful to discuss feynman integrals in their own right , without restrictions to a particular quantum field theory .",
    "computations of higher order corrections to observables often start from the consideration of hundreds or thousands of feynman integrals with tensor structure , and proceed via effective standard procedures to reduce the problem , possibly to a relatively small number of scalar integrals . at higher loop - orders , the evaluation of",
    "the latter remains to be the hard part of the problem .",
    "there is no algorithm which would succeed in the analytical computation of every feynman integral .",
    "however , there is a variety of powerful methods which have been useful for a wide range of relevant cases , such as the mellin - barnes approach ( see @xcite ) , the expansion of hypergeometric functions @xcite , differential equation methods @xcite , difference equations @xcite or position - space methods @xcite ( also see @xcite ) . in this talk",
    "we focus on the approach of iteratively integrating out feynman parameters by use of multiple polylogarithms .    in order to choose an appropriate strategy for the computation of a given feynman integral",
    ", it would be desirable in general , to know in advance , which are the classes of functions and numbers the integral may evaluate to . as a slightly more refined question of this type we may ask : which scalar feynman integrals can be expressed by multiple polylogarithms and multiple zeta values , and for which integrals do we need a wider range of functions and numbers ? in the past few years , questions of this type turned out to define a fruitful common field of research for quantum field theorists and algebraic geometers alike . while the physicist s interest in these questions is given by the desire to compute specific integrals or to learn about the number content of a given quantum field theory , the mathematician arrives at the same question from a different direction . in a very general context",
    ", feynman integrals can be viewed as period integrals , and the question of evaluating to multiple zeta values is related to the question wether an underlying motive is mixed tate over @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .    a definite classification of feynman graphs with respect to the above questions is missing",
    "however , for vacuum and two - point graphs important progress was made by considering the first symanzik polynomial , given by the feynman parametric representation of a feynman integral .",
    "even though many vacuum - type feynman integrals evaluate to multiple zeta values @xcite , this is not the case in general . a first vacuum graph whose period has to belong to a set of numbers beyond multiple zeta values",
    "was exhibited in a recent article by brown and schnetz @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "when allowing the feynman integrals to depend on kinematical invariants and particle masses , we can ask for graphs where multiple polylogarithms are not sufficient to express the result . here",
    "the first cases show up at much lower loop - order , such as in the case of massive sunrise graphs and related graphs with a cut through three massive edges ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this",
    "talk we review a criterion on graphs which is related to the above questions and show that if a graph satisfies the criterion , its minors do so as well . in graph theory",
    "such a minor monotony is an important and desireable feature . in section 2",
    "we begin with a brief reminder on scalar feynman integrals , their two symanzik polynomials and the approach of integrating out feynman parameters by use of multiple polylogarithms . in section 3",
    "we briefly review the criterion of linear reducibility of a graph , which is used to decide whether a given integral can be computed by use of the method .",
    "if this is the case , the functions and numbers in all intermediate steps and in the result will not exceed combinations of multiple polylogarithms and their values at rational points . in this way",
    "the criterion and the corresponding algorithm are useful tools for adressing the above questions . in the case of integrals only involving the first symanzik polynomial , the criterion was extensively studied in @xcite . as the iterated integration over feynman parameters",
    "can be expected to be useful in the case of integrals depending on kinematical invariants and particle masses as well , we intend to extend the discussion to the second symanzik polynomial . in section 4",
    "we consider linear reducibility with respect to both symanzik polynomials and show that the set of linearly reducible graphs is closed under taking minors .",
    "this property is useful for a classification , as it allows us to characterize families of reducible graphs by a small number of graphs not belonging to the family . in a case",
    "study we exhibit such a forbidden minor at the level of massless three - loop graphs with four on - shell legs .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall some general facts about feynman integrals , symanzik polynomials and a method to compute period integrals by use of multiple polylogarithms .",
    "let us begin with a generic feynman graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 edges , loop - number ( i.e. first betti number ) @xmath3 and with @xmath4 external half - edges ( or legs ) .",
    "we label each edge @xmath5 by an integration variable @xmath6 ( feynman parameter ) , an integer @xmath7 ( exponent of the feynman propagator ) , a real or complex variable @xmath8 ( particle mass ) .",
    "each leg is labelled by a vector @xmath9 ( external momentum ) .    to this labelled graph @xmath1",
    "we associate the scalar feynman integral in dimensional regularization:@xmath10 where @xmath11 ( we omit to write a trivial prefactor by which the integral becomes independent of the physical mass - scale . )",
    "the feynman integral @xmath12 and the function @xmath13 depend on the particle masses and on certain kinematical invariants , which are quadratic functions of the external momenta .",
    "the functions @xmath14 and @xmath13 are the first and second symanzik polynomial of the graph .",
    "a definition is given below .",
    "usually a feynman integral is associated to a feynman graph by feynman rules in momentum or position space , and we refer to the literature @xcite for the standard computation leading from there to the feynman parametric representation given in eq .",
    "[ eq : generic i_g ] .",
    "[ eq : generic i_g ] defines a very general class of integrals which deserves our attention for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the class contains the feynman integrals of scalar quantum field theory such as @xmath15 or @xmath16theory .",
    "secondly , any feynman integral with a tensor - structure , arising from a physical quantum field theory , can in principle be expressed in terms of scalar integrals of the above class @xcite .",
    "thirdly , as we allow the @xmath17 to take arbitrary integer values , there are well - known identities between these scalar integrals which can be used for efficient reduction procedures @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , integrals of the above class appear in a wide range of physical set - ups and their evaluation is the bottleneck of many computational problems in particle physics .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 can either be fixed to the integer space - time dimension or , as the integral is very often ill - defined in the desired dimension , one may consider @xmath12 in dimensional regularisation where @xmath18 is a complex variable .",
    "then , in order to separate the pole - terms and obtain finite contributions in four - dimenional minkowski space , one usually attempts to compute the coefficients of a laurent - expansion @xmath19 with @xmath20 to a desired order .",
    "even though the computation of the functions @xmath21 can be very difficult , we can make a general statement about them .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if for an arbitrary feynman graph we evaluate any function @xmath21 at algebraic values of the squared particle masses @xmath22 and kinematical invariants @xmath23 , where all @xmath24 and all @xmath25 we obtain a _ period _ according to the definition of kontsevich and zagier @xcite .",
    "for the special case where the feynman integral takes the form @xmath26 this statement was already proven in @xcite .",
    "it seems that feynman integrals in fact evaluate to a restricted subset of periods and it is an important challenge to understand which one this is .",
    "let us now recall the definition of the symanzik polynomials of a feynman graph @xmath27 the first symanzik polynomial is defined as@xmath28 where the sum is over all spanning trees of the graph @xmath27 the second symanzik polynomial is defined as @xmath29 with @xmath30 here the sum runs through all spanning two - forests @xmath31 of @xmath1 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the connected components of the forest .    in order to define the kinematical invariants @xmath34",
    "we introduce an arbitrary orientation on @xmath27 we firstly say that each external momentum @xmath9 is incoming at the vertex at the corresponding leg .",
    "we furthermore label each oriented edge by a momentum - vector @xmath35 .",
    "if the edge @xmath5 is oriented from vertex @xmath36 to @xmath37 then @xmath35 is said to be incoming at @xmath37 and @xmath38 is incoming at @xmath39 momentum - conservation on @xmath1 is reflected in our labels by the condition that the sum of all external momenta @xmath9 is zero , and at each vertex , the sum of all incoming momenta is zero . by these conditions , except for @xmath40 momenta , each of the @xmath35 can be expressed as a linear combination of external momenta .",
    "the kinematical invariants are defined as @xmath41 where the sign of @xmath42 is fixed by the condition that we sum over the momenta incoming at the component @xmath43 note that by momentum conservation , the @xmath44 are functions of the external momenta .    as an alternative to the above construction by spanning trees and forests ,",
    "there are several ways to obtain both symanzik polynomials from determinants of certain matrices @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate such a derivation , let us label each edge @xmath5 by an auxiliary variable @xmath45 .",
    "each vertex @xmath46 is labelled by @xmath47 for a feynman graph with vertices @xmath48 we consider an @xmath49 matrix @xmath50 whose entries are : @xmath51 we compute the determinant @xmath52 and consider the function @xmath53 which is a polynomial in the @xmath54 and @xmath55variables .",
