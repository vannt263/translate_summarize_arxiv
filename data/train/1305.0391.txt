    "ultracold atomic and molecular few- and many - body systems offer a unique platform for a detailed understanding and analysis of fundamental quantum properties .",
    "the preparation and control of such systems in specific quantum states offer many opportunities for exploring elementary quantum dynamical processes .",
    "experimentally , one can control the external motion of the atoms by designing and switching between almost arbitrarily shaped traps @xcite , and the strength of the interaction among the atoms can be tuned by magnetic or optical feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "a striking new species are the weakly bound ultralong - range diatomic molecules composed of a ground state and a rydberg atom whose existence has been predicted theoretically more than a decade ago @xcite and which have been discovered experimentally only recently @xcite .",
    "the molecular born - oppenheimer potential energy curves , which are responsible for the atomic binding , show for these species a very unusual oscillatory behavior with many local minima .",
    "the latter can be understood intuitively and modeled correspondingly as the interaction of a neutral ground state atom with the rydberg electron of the second atom . in a first approximation ,",
    "the interaction between the two constituents is described by a @xmath0-wave scattering dominated fermi - pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distance for these molecular states is of the order of the size of the rydberg atom and the vibrational binding energies are in the mhz to ghz regime for principal quantum numbers @xmath2 depending on the type of states .",
    "more specifically , low - angular momentum non - polar states and large angular momentum polar states , so - called trilobites , have been predicted @xcite.they possess electric dipole moments in the range of 1debye ( low-@xmath3)@xcite up to 1kdebye ( high-@xmath3)@xcite in the polar case",
    ". the large electric dipole moment of the latter makes them accessible for electric field manipulation which opens the interesting possibility for the external control of molecular degrees of freedom . beyond the @xmath0-wave interactions ,",
    "@xmath1-wave scattering has been shown @xcite to lead to a class of shape - resonance - induced long - range molecular rydberg states .",
    "+ the impact of magnetic fields on these ultralong - range molecules has been studied in @xcite where it has in particular been shown that the magnetic field provides an angular confinement turning a rotational degree of freedom into a vibrational one and yields , with increasing strength , a monotonic lowering of the magnitude of the electric dipole moment .",
    "polyatomic ultralong - range molecules formed of a rydberg atom and several ground state perturber , such as collinear triatomic species , can be constructed by taking the diatomic wave function as a basic unit and constructing the corresponding symmetry - adapted orbitals @xcite .",
    "recently the formation of rydberg trimers and excited dimers bound by internal quantum reflection @xcite have been observed experimentally and analyzed in detail theoretically @xcite .",
    "moreover , it it has been shown how the electric field of a rydberg electron can bind a polar molecule to form a giant ultralong - range stable triatomic molecule @xcite which can consequently be controlled by applying external electric fields .",
    "combining electric and magnetic fields in a crossed field configuration the existence and properties of so - called giant dipole ultralong - range molecules have been shown @xcite .",
    "opposite to the above - mentioned rydberg molecules this species has no open radiative decay channels .    in spite of the diversity of works focusing on ultralong - range molecules an original investigation of the impact of external electric fields specifically on the polar trilobite states is missing",
    "such an investigation is particularly desirable due to the strong sensitivity of these rydberg molecules with respect to the external field which provides a handle on the control of their properties on a single molecule basis but also for their interactions in potential many - body systems . for these reasons we perform in this work a study of the impact of an electric field on the structure and dynamics of high-@xmath3 ultralong - range diatomic rubidium molecules .",

    "v we analyze the evolution of the topology of the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) with changing electric field .",
    "the resulting pes show a strongly oscillatory behavior with bound states in the mhz and ghz regime . with increasing field strength the diatomic molecular equilibrium distance shifts substantially in a range of the order of thousand bohr radii .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the corresponding electric dipole moment thereby achieving molecular states with a dipole moment up to several kdebye . based on these properties and the @xmath0-wave admixture via the external electric field a preparation scheme for high-@xmath3 polar molecular electronic states via a two photon excitation process",

    "finally , we provide an analysis of the vibrational spectra which exhibit spacings of the order of several mhz .",
    "we consider a highly excited rydberg atom interacting with a ground state neutral perturber atom ( we will focus on the @xmath4rb atom here ) in a static and homogeneous electric field .",
    "the hamiltonian treating the rb ionic core and the neutral perturber as point particles is given by ( if not stated otherwise , atomic units will be used throughout ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 denote the atomic @xmath7 mass and the relative momentum and position of the neutral perturber with respect to the ionic core .",

    "for @xmath36 we neglect all quantum defects , i.e.  @xmath10 is identical to the hydrogen problem .",
    "finally , we have to solve the following eigenvalue problem @xmath37 for which we use standard numerical techniques for the diagonalization of hermitian matrices . throughout this work we mainly focus on the high-@xmath3 @xmath38 manifold which provides the trilobite states in case of zero electric field",
    "@xcite . to ensure convergence we vary the number of basis states finally achieving a relative accuracy of @xmath39 for the energy . for the @xmath38 trilobite manifold we used , in addition to the degenerate @xmath40 manifold , a basis set that includes the @xmath41 quantum defect split states due to their energetically closeness .",

    "this means that the states @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parity ( anti)symmetric and the pes fulfill @xmath50 . in addition , the pes possess an azimuthal symmetry , e.g.  the vector defining the internuclear axis can , without loss of generality , be chosen to lie in the @xmath51-plane . in the absence of any field , the pes depend exclusively on the internuclear distance @xmath52 .",
    "however , if a field is present , the pes are cylindrical symmetric , which means they also depend on the angle of inclination @xmath53 between the field vector and the internuclear axis , e.  g.  @xmath54 .",
    "in several previous works the interaction between the rydberg electron and the neutral perturber has been modeled to consist exclusively of a @xmath0-wave scattering potential @xcite . in this case , a single potential curve splits away from the @xmath55 degenerate high-@xmath56 manifold forming a strongly oscillating born - oppenheimer potential energy surface with a depth of around @xmath57 providing rovibrational states with a level spacing of approximately @xmath58mhz and a permanent electric dipole moment of @xmath59kdebye .",

    "the effect of the @xmath1-wave contribution and its resonant behavior on adiabatic potential curves has been studied in detail in several works , see @xcite .",

    "the mechanism underlying the oscillating behaviour of the potential energy surfaces for ultralong - range molecules composed of a rydberg atom plus neutral ground state atom is the following .",
    "the neutral atom is to a good approximation point - like and its interaction with the rydberg atom probes the highly excited electronic wave function locally in space , meaning that the highly oscillatory character of the rydberg wave function is mapped onto the potential energy surface .",
    "this holds both for the absence and presence of an electric field .    for the non - polar low - angular momentum states which are states that are splitted from the ( degenerate ) hydrogenic manifold by a sizable quantum defect @xcite the oscillations of the potential energy typically amount to many mhz . the @xmath78 state shown in fig .",

    "( [ pes_curves]a ) ( many bound vibrational states exist in both cases ) .",

    "the recent spectacular experiments @xcite preparing , detecting and probing some of the important properties of non - polar ultralong - range rydberg molecules have opened the doorway towards a plethora of possibilities to create new exotic species where atoms , molecules or even clusters and mesoscopic quantum objects might be bound to electronic rydberg systems .",
    "it is therefore of crucial importance to learn how the properties of these rydberg molecules can be tuned finally leading to a control of the structure and potentially dynamics of these systems .",
    "the primary choice are here external fields in particular due to the susceptibility of the weakly bound rydberg electrons . in the present work",
    "we have therefore explored the changes the polar high angular momentum trilobite states experience if they are exposed to an electric field of varying strength .",
    "taking into account @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions it turns out that the electric field provides us with a unique know to control the topology of the adiabatic potential energy surface .",
    "first of all , the angular degree of freedom between the electric field and internuclear axis is converted from a rotational to a vibrational degree of freedom thereby rendering the field - free potential energy curve into a two - dimensional potential energy surface .",
    "it turns out that the global equilibrium position is always the antiparallel configuration of these two axes .",
    "the sequence of potential wells with increasing radial coordinate , i.e.  the oscillatory behavior of the potential is changed dramatically in the presence of the field .",
    "in particular we encounter an overall lowering of the energy accompanied by a subsequently crossover of the energetically order of the individual wells .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium distance and the lowest vibrational states are systematically shifted to larger internuclear distances .",
    "the @xmath1-wave split state which , due to its resonant behavior , lowers dramatically in energy with decreasing internuclear distance and therefore crosses the polar trilobite state close to its equilibrium distance in the zero - field case , can now with increasing field strength be systematically shifted away from the energetically lowering equilibrium distance and corresponding well .",
    "in such a way the respective stability of the ground and many excited vibrational states of the polar trilobite state is guaranteed . for strong fields",
    "the interaction of the latter state with non - polar ( quantum defect split ) states , which are very weakly polarized in the presence of the field , leads to a strong admixture of , in our specific case , @xmath0-wave character to the polar high angular momentum states . as a consequence ,",
    "a two - photon excitation process starting from the ground state of the two - atom system should be sufficient to efficiently excite these states and probe their character .",
    "the electric dipole moment , which is steadily increasing with increasing electric field strength starting from zero - field , does , due to the above admixture , decrease in the strong field regime . + to obtain an even richer topology of the potential energy surfaces of the trilobite states the combination of static electric and magnetic field would be the next step . in this case",
    "both rotational degrees of freedom in field - free space will , in general , turn into vibrational modes rendering the field - free potential energy curve a three - dimensional potential energy surface . depending on the configuration , such as parallel or crossed fields , the remaining symmetries might even lead to controllable crossings or avoided crossings of the surfaces which will be the subject of a future investigation .",
