    "entanglement , especially high dimensional entanglement , has been recognized as the crucial ingredient in many quantum information processes , such as quantum communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite . thus more and more attention has been paid to generating qubit or qudit entangled states in cavity qed @xcite , ion trap @xcite , superconducting qubit @xcite , linear optical system @xcite , semiconductor quantum dot @xcite , and so on .",
    "the technique of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , which was shown theoretically @xcite and implemented experimentally in population transfer process in molecules and atoms @xcite , has been broadly used in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . in this technique are involved two delayed , but partly overlapping pulses  pump and stokes  with the stokes pulse applied first .",
