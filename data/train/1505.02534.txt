    "-space optical ( fso ) communications provide high data rate transmission with higher security and higher flexibility compared with conventional wireless communications .",
    "however , fso signals are attenuated when transmitted through air by atmospheric phenomena such as rain , fog and snow that reduce the range of the system and deteriorate the quality of the transmission .",
    "also , atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors cause fluctuations in the intensity of the received signal and further degrade the link performance .",
    "additionally , the background radiation constitutes an undesired component to the received signal which also fluctuates due to the environmental uncertainty .    due to the complexity of phase and frequency modulation , intensity modulation ( i m )",
    "is used for most current fso systems .",
    "there are mainly two types of detection methods : direct detection ( dd ) and photon counting ( pc ) , both of which require accurate knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) and background radiation for reliable data detection . in @xcite , we have surveyed the literature and considered the detection issues for im / dd systems . in particular , we have applied the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) principle to design a robust receiver that performs implicit csi acquisition and automatic threshold adjustment . the receiver is shown to be able to achieve the error performance of a receiver with perfect csi . in this paper , we will focus on im / pc systems .",
    "in @xcite , pulse position modulation ( ppm ) is used , which does not require csi and the background information for data detection but has less spectral efficiency compared to the i m . with the assumption that the receiver perfectly knows the background information and the channel model information ( cmi ) , i.e. , the statistical distribution of the channel gain , in @xcite , a maximum likeliohood ( ml ) sequence detection ( mlsd ) method for the photon - counting system",
    "is proposed . to simplify the implementation , a fast search algorithm called multi - symbol detection ( msd ) algorithm ,",
    "is also proposed in @xcite . with this msd algorithm",
    ", the receiver performs block - by - block detection and the implementation complexity per symbol detection is reduced to o(@xmath0 ) operations , where @xmath1 denotes the block length .",
    "however , the requirement of the accurate cmi and background information can hardly be satisfied in practice . later",
    ", a generalised mlsd ( gmlsd ) receiver , which requires no cmi and has a simpler form , is proposed in @xcite where the same msd algorithm as that in @xcite for implementation is suggested .",
    "it works with neither csi nor cmi , but requires the knowledge of background radiation , which still limits its applicability in time - varying environments .",
    "in addition , for the receiver in @xcite , an undesired error floor problem is observed .",
    "the glrt principle is a very powerful approach for receiver design in the presence of unknown channel parameters .",
    "having applied it to the im / dd system in @xcite , we apply it here to the im / pc system and obtain a robust sequence receiver which can automatically and continuously estimate the csi and the background radiation and detect the data sequence accordingly . a viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm similar to that we have introduced in @xcite , which reduces the search complexity to a level that is independent of the observation window length ,",
    "is adopted for efficient implementation .",
    "besides , we use a selective - store strategy to overcome the error floor problem observed in @xcite . to further reduce the implementation complexity , a decision - feedback ( dfb ) symbol - by - symbol receiver is developed . to distinguish our two receivers from others , we call our sequence receiver the glrt sequence receiver and our dfb receiver the glrt dfb receiver .",
    "the simulation and analytical results show that as the observation window length increases , both our sequence receiver and dfb receiver can achieve the _ genie bound _ , which is defined as the bit error probability ( bep ) of the receiver with perfect csi and background information .",
    "additionally , we slightly simplify the gmlsd receiver in @xcite and simulate it using our viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm and selective - store strategy .",
    "the result shows that the error floor can be completely avoided .",
    "we also simplify the gmlsd receiver in @xcite to a dfb receiver .",
    "we call the original receiver in @xcite the gmlsd sequence receiver , and call our simplification the gmlsd dfb receiver .",
    "particular comparisons and discussions will be given in corresponding sections and the advantages of our glrt ( sequence and dfb ) receivers over the existing receivers will be explained .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . a mathematical system model of the fso photon counting system perturbed by atmospheric turbulence , pointing errors and background radiation is briefly reviewed in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we briefly illustrate three existing receivers , i.e. the ideal receiver with perfect csi and background information , the mlsd receiver introduced in @xcite , and the gmlsd sequence receiver introduced in @xcite . we also give a brief discussion of the three receivers . in section iv",
    ", we present our glrt sequence receiver and the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm as well as our selective - store strategy .",
    "the glrt dfb receiver is introduced in section v , and the gmlsd dfb receiver is developed as a special case of the glrt dfb receiver .",
    "the performance results of all the receivers and discussions are given in section vi .",
    "in the last section , our conclusions are drawn .",

    ", we define @xmath15 as the the effective count parameters due to the received signal and in later parts of this paper , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are used interchangeably .",
    "consequently , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are used interchangeably .      as in @xcite ,",
    "the channel gain @xmath11 is formulated as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are used to denote geometric spread and pointing errors , atmospheric turbulence , and path loss , respectively . in @xcite",
    ", log - normal distribution is adopted to model @xmath22 for weak turbulence , and gamma - gamma distribution for moderate to strong turbulence and the negative exponential distribution for strong turbulence . since in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the gamma - gamma distribution can nicely fit the channel fading statistics of all turbulence regimes , in this paper , we only consider @xmath22 is a gamma - gamma distributed random variable , and the _ probability density function _ ( pdf ) of @xmath22 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the variances of the small and large scale eddies , respectively .",
    "pointing error influence on an fso system is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and we here use the model in @xcite where the pdf of @xmath21 is given as @xmath28 parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants , and further details can be found in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the path loss @xmath23 is considered as a deterministic variable .",
    "this is rigorously wrong since @xmath23 depends highly on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver and the atmospheric condition which is definitely time - varying .",
    "however , if we only consider a short range of time , e.g. on the order of seconds , @xmath23 can be regarded as a constant .",
    "since we only consider the receiver side signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) which is defined later in , we can incorporate @xmath23 into @xmath22 which amounts to setting @xmath31 .",
    "then for a turbulent channel with pointing errors , the channel gain is @xmath32 , and its pdf can be derived by performing @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the pdf of @xmath22 , and can be found in @xcite . it should be emphasized that is not an always - correct expression for the pdf of @xmath11 since we artificially set @xmath23 as 1 .",
    "if a receiver highly depends on the knowledge of @xmath35 , using is inappropriate . in our work",
    ", we will show that our receiver does not depend on @xmath35 , and is only used to present some numerical results .    as pointing errors are considered as well as atmospheric turbulence in our paper , the scintillation index ( si ) ,",

    "since we use the gamma - gamma fading model , the si can also be calculated according to @xmath38@xcite .",
    "the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , which is defined as the ratio of the squared expected mean of the information bearing component to the total variance of the received signal @xcite , is @xmath39)^2}{(2n_s\\mathbb{e}[h]+4n_b)}. \\label{eq : snr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] specifically , if pilot symbols are required , for example , there are @xmath40 pilot symbols and @xmath41 data symbols in every data packet , the effective snr is given by @xmath42    since the time scales of the fading processes are of the order of @xmath43s to @xmath44s @xcite , which is far larger than the bit interval ( @xmath45s for multi - gbps systems ) , @xmath11 is considered to be constant over a large number ( @xmath46 ) of transmitted data symbols . in general , the fso system is exposed to ambient light , which is random and time - varying , hence the assumption made in @xcite that @xmath13 equals 39 constantly and is known at the receiver side , is not realistic in practice . according to the experimental results reported in @xcite , the photocurrent due to",
    "background radiation is commonly in the kilo - hertz region .",
    "for some special source , e.g. , the fluorescent lamps geared by electronic ballasts , the photocurrent fluctuates in the mega - hertz region .",
    "thus , it is more reasonable to assume that the background radiation strength ( both natural or artificial ) is time - varying but keeps coherent during intervals of the order of @xmath47s - @xmath48s .",
    "thus , with this assumption , the effective count parameter due to background radiation has a coherence time roughly on the order of @xmath47s -@xmath48s .",
    "thus , the channel coherence length @xmath49 , which is defined as the number of data symbols over which @xmath11 and @xmath13 can be regarded as constants , is of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "it should be emphasized that for our proposed glrt receivers , the observation window length @xmath51 is much shorter than @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "thus , within the observation window with length @xmath51 , we can treat @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( including @xmath16 ) as unknown but non - random constant parameters . in our receiver design introduced in sections iv and v , the values of @xmath12 and @xmath16 , and the distribution of @xmath11",
    "are not required .",
    "we only use the distribution of @xmath11 and choose appropriate parameter values to run simulations and to show numerical results in section vi .",
    "the ideal receiver is considered as a benchmark for the performance analysis of all other receivers in this paper .",
    "it is assumed to accurately have all the information , i.e. , the accurate values of @xmath13 and @xmath16 , for detection . when @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , the decision rule is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the decision on @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath57 , obviously , we have @xmath58 thus , the decision rule when @xmath57 is @xmath59 when @xmath60 , by substituting the signal pmf into and simplifying it , the decision rule is reduced to @xmath61    the average bit error probability ( bep ) over all possible channel states is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the probability that a `` 0 '' is transmitted but a `` 1 '' is the decision made by the receiver , conditioned on a given channel parameter combination @xmath64 ; similarly , @xmath65 is the conditional probability that a `` 1 '' is transmitted but a `` 0 '' is detected .",
    "the value of @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be evaluated by @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the _ cumulative distribution function _ ( cdf ) of a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath71 . in and",
    ", @xmath72 denotes the decision threshold , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "the average bep obtained from is also referred to as the genie bound .    from -",
    ", we see that the error probability is related to @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the pdf of @xmath11 .",
    "unlike some other systems , the snr value alone can not determine the bep here .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 , the corresponding snr is 12.5 and bep is @xmath75 ; if @xmath76 , the corresponding snr is till 12.5 but bep changes to @xmath77 .",
    "also , we see that increasing the value of @xmath13 will decrease the snr and thus degrade the system performance , even for the ideal receiver . for receivers using an inaccurate value of @xmath13 , the error performance is further degraded .",
    "we will show that our proposed receivers can approach the ideal receiver s performance , but not completely cancel the background radiation .",
    "a mlsd receiver for the mimo photon - counting system has been introduced in @xcite , and here we just introduce its siso case .",
    "it assumes that at the receiver side the channel model information , together with the value of @xmath13 which is 39 constantly , is available perfectly . at each time @xmath8",
    ", we consider a subsequence @xmath78 of the immediate past @xmath1 transmitted data symbols given by @xmath79 $ ] , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , @xmath82 $ ] is used to denote the corresponding received signal subsequence .",
    "the mlsd receiver performs joint detection on the transmitted subsequence based on @xmath83 by eliminating irrelevant terms in , the decision rule is reduced to @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes its decision metric for subsequence @xmath86 .",
    "notation @xmath87 is used to denote the decision on @xmath88 .",
    "quantities @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined as @xmath91 and @xmath92 for simplicity of notation , we drop the dependence on @xmath93 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 and use @xmath94 and @xmath95 instead , but it should be emphasized that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are functions of @xmath96 .",
    "this mlsd receiver performs block - by - block detection using a multi - symbol detection ( msd ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "blocks with length @xmath1 are considered . to find the optimal msd solution in practice , we first let @xmath97 denote the sorted values of @xmath9 , ordered from the largest to the smallest . secondly",
    ", we define @xmath98 to be the sum of the @xmath94 largest values of @xmath9 ; that is @xmath99 to determine what value of @xmath94 maximizes the msd metric , must be evaluated for each @xmath100 , using its partner @xmath101 . according to @xcite , the msd sequence will correspond to the estimate @xmath102 which satisfies @xmath103 by using the reverse mapping of the sorting associated with , the final decision @xmath87 can be generated .",
    "specifically , ones will be assigned to the indices corresponding to the largest values of @xmath9 in @xmath4 , and zeros will be assigned to the remaining @xmath104 elements of @xmath87 .    in summary ,",
    "@xmath105 operations are required for sorting , @xmath106 to calculate @xmath98 for all @xmath94 , and @xmath106 to perform the @xmath1 metric evaluations .",
    "thus , the algorithm has an overall complexity of @xmath105 operations per @xmath1 symbol decisions , or @xmath107 operations per symbol decision , and is only logarithmically dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "this is a significant reduction relative to the complexity of a brute force search , which is @xmath108 on a per symbol decision basis .",
    "this gmlsd receiver is proposed in @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the channel model information is unavailable at the receiver side ; but the value of @xmath13 is 39 constantly and known by the receiver .",
    "this gmlsd receiver jointly decides on @xmath78 and @xmath11 that maximize @xmath109 , which is the pmf of the received subsequence and is given by @xmath110 we use @xmath111 to denote the estimate of @xmath11 . for a given @xmath5 ,",
    "the solution of equation @xmath112 which is given by @xmath113 makes @xmath114 achieve its maximum value . by substituting @xmath115 into @xmath116 and eliminating irrelevant terms",
    ", the decision metric becomes @xmath117 similar to , this gmlsd receiveris decision is @xmath118 it also performs block - by - block detection and uses the msd algorithm introduced in @xcite and briefly introduced in the previous subsection .",
    "in implementation , the ideal receiver must have exact values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , in practice , without channel estimation , knowing these values is impossible .",
    "using pilot symbols to estimate these parameters reduces bandwidth and energy efficiency , and thus obviously is not desirable . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider channel estimation with pilot symbols . the performance of the ideal receiver is just referred to as a benchmark when analysing other receivers performance . the benefit of the mlsd receiver proposed in @xcite is to obviate the need for accurate values of @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the evaluation of its decision metric which involves complicated integrals demands high computational capability of the receiver hardware .",
    "the search complexity of the msd algorithm increases with the number of symbol decisions in the block .",
    "as long blocks are preferred for better performance , a large complexity seems inevitable and receiver hardware with very high computational capability is a prerequisite .",
    "besides , when performing block - by - block detection , using a large block length @xmath1 brings a long system delay .",
    "even if a powerful processor is available , the requirement that the exact distribution of @xmath11 and the exact value of @xmath13 be known makes the implementation impractical .",
    "the gmlsd receiver , introduced in @xcite , does not require the distribution of @xmath11 to be known .",
    "another benefit is that the evaluation of its decision metric can be easily performed since no integrals are involved .",
    "however , the undesired features due to the msd algorithm , such as a high search complexity and a large system delay , still exist . besides , an error floor problem is observed in @xcite . furthermore , since the accurate value of @xmath13 is required , the performance of this gmlsd receiver may deteriorate when the receiver is exposed to time - varying ambient light .    in later sections of this paper , we will develop new receivers , and propose new implementation methods to overcome all the problems mentioned above .",
    "as discussed previously , the receiver is likely to be exposed to time - varying , environmental ambient radiation , even though by employing a well - designed shade , an optical filter , or both , the ambient light component can be decreased .",
    "nevertheless , a residual component with weak but time - varying intensity is inevitable .",
    "since the value of @xmath13 is unavailable at the receiver side , the glrt sequence receiver jointly decides on @xmath78 , @xmath16 ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath13 that maximize @xmath120 .    at time @xmath8 , the pmf of the received subsequence is @xmath121 for a given @xmath5 , the solution of the simultaneous equations @xmath122 @xmath123 makes @xmath124 achieve its maximum value .",
    "we first get the solution of , which is @xmath125 by substituting the solution @xmath126 back into @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 have been defined in and , respectively .",
    "next , we differentiate @xmath129 with respect to @xmath13 ; and then , similarly , the solution of equation is obtained as @xmath130 in , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are functions of @xmath133 , and they are defined as @xmath134 and @xmath135 similar to @xmath136 and @xmath137 , for simplicity of notation , we also drop the dependence on @xmath138 and use @xmath139 and @xmath140 instead . after substituting the solution",
    "@xmath141 back into @xmath142 and eliminating irrelevant terms , we obtain the decision metric @xmath143 however , in simulation , we observed that the value of some parts in the metric would become too large and cause a memory overflow problem on the computer ( larger than @xmath144 ) . hence , by taking @xmath145 of the right side of , we obtain our glrt sequence receiver s decision metric @xmath146 similar to and , the decision of this glrt sequence receiver is made by performing @xmath147 it should be noted that when the observation window size is very small and the background radiation is very weak , i.e. , the @xmath13 value is very small , @xmath148 is very likely to be zero .",
    "when @xmath149 , for both receiver hardware and simulation software , there might be an ambiguity in evaluating the term @xmath150 of the decision metric .",
    "thus , we use the limit of that term when @xmath151 to define its actual value at @xmath149 , i.e. , in implementation , we pre - define @xmath152 which can easily be shown to be zero .    clearly , no integrals are involved in the glrt sequence receiver decision metric , resulting in low computational complexity . it does not require any knowledge of the fading distribution , and therefore is robust and practical .",
    "additionally , since the value of @xmath13 is not required in , compared to the gmlsd receiver proposed in @xcite , our glrt sequence receiver is more practical for implementation . in a later section",
    ", we will show it is robust in slowly time - varying environments , regardless of the distributions of @xmath11 and the value of @xmath13 .              in implemention",
    ", we adopt the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm and the selective - store strategy similar to what we have introduced in @xcite for implementing the decision metric that we use for selection of survivors .",
    "a trellis diagram is shown in fig . [ fg : glrt_trellis ] , where there are two nodes at each time @xmath8 and each node is labelled corresponding to data symbol `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' .",
    "for each node , there are two paths entering it and the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm keeps the one with a higher metric value and discards the other .",
    "thus , at each time @xmath8 , only two paths exist as survivors and the tail before the merge point of the two survivors give the firm output decisions .",
    "the selective - store fundamental is the same as that in @xcite but the specific strategy is modified here .",
    "we name the part before the merge point the _ detected _ part , and the part after , the _ ongoing _ part .",
    "also , we name signals that are detected to carry data symbol `` 1 '' the 1-detected signals ; and similarly , the 0-detected signal is defined as the signal that is detected to carry data symbol `` 0 '' .",
    "clearly , @xmath95 can be obtained as @xmath153 , and similarly for @xmath94 , @xmath148 and @xmath154 . in this selective - store strategy",
    ", we keep the values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 the same , i.e. , @xmath157 . as shown in fig .",

    "when a new 1-detected ( 0-detected ) signal is detected , the system drops the oldest 1-detected ( 0-detected ) signal stored in @xmath159 ( @xmath158 ) and puts the new signal in .",
    "in this way , the values of @xmath161 and @xmath162 can be calculated by recursively subtracting the oldest and adding the newest .",
    "for the on - going part , we use arrays @xmath163 and @xmath164 to store the two survivors and array @xmath165 to store the undetected signals .",
    "the values of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are calculated based on the values stored in arrays @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ fg : memory_glrt_seq ] , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the lengths of the sequence ongoing part and the memory array for storing the ongoing part .",

    "we can see that the metric evaluation complexity with our selective - store strategy is still very low and independent of @xmath1 .",
    "after adopting the selective - store strategy , the receiver is probably not using a subsequence with consecutive signals to form the decision metric because it is with a high probability that there are unequal numbers of 0-detected signals and 1-detected signals in a subsequence with length @xmath1 .",

    "is obtained by simulation .    for different si values ( 0.1244 and 1.3890 ) and different @xmath13 values ( from 5 to 100 ) , the simulation results obtained by implementing the pcsi receiver are in complete accord with the corresponding results by numerically integrating the bep formula .",
    "hence , in this paper , when referring to the performance of the pcsi receiver , we only give the numerical integration results .      in fig .",
    "[ fg : seq_snr ] , we plot the performance of the gmlsd sequence and the glrt sequence receiver with different @xmath13 values .",

    "this is because the glrt sequence receiver has to estimate two channel parameters ( @xmath16 and @xmath13 ) , but the gmlsd receiver only estimates one ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "when the system memory length increases , both sequence receivers can estimate unknown channels almost perfectly and thus achieve the genie bound .",
    "we are interested in how the two sequence receivers will perform if @xmath13 is not perfectly known at the receiver .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : seq_snr_20 ] where @xmath201 and fig .",
    "[ fg : seq_snr_60 ] where @xmath202 , we show the simulation results for both receivers .",
    "similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fg : seq_snr_39 ] , our glrt sequence receiver suffers from an approximate 1 db power loss compared to the genie bound when @xmath199 , and achieves the genie bound when @xmath203 .",
    "however , we can see that the performance of the gmlsd receiver deteriorates whenever @xmath13 increases or decreases .",
    "even with a very large value of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath204 , since it does not know that the @xmath13 value has been changed from 39 , its performance can not converge to the genie bound .",
    "since we adopt the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm , we can simulate these two sequence receivers efficiently with any arbitrary large value of @xmath1 ( @xmath175 ) to achieve the optimum performance .",
    "the adoption of the selective - store strategy helps us efficiently use the memory and completely avoid the potential error floor .",
    "when implementing the gmlsd receiver , the msd algorithm proposed in @xcite is adopted by the authors of @xcite , where an error floor is observed with low @xmath1 values .",
    "we also simulate the gmlsd sequence receiver using our viteri - type trellis - search algorithm with selective store strategy and plot the results in fig .",
    "[ fg : compare ] .",
    "we can clearly see that , with our implementation method , the gmlsd sequence receiver performs much better and also completely avoids the potential error floor .",
    ", @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath194 , but pointing error is not considered . ]      by simulation , using the same channel conditions ( turbulence conditions , snr , @xmath13 value and @xmath1 value ) , we find that the dfb receivers have almost the same performance as their corresponding sequence receivers .",
    "thus , readers are suggested to refer to fig .",
    "[ fg : seq_snr ] and we do not replot them . here , we present the dfb receivers performance where @xmath13 is chosen randomly from 10 to 100 with equal probability . since the background radiation condition ( the statistical distribution of the radiation strength ) might be different in different situations , in our work here , we just use this randomly chosen @xmath13 to test the robustness of our receivers .",
    "first , in fig .",
    "[ fg : dfb_snr_uniform ] , we plot the simulation results of both our glrt dfb receiver and the gmlsd dfb receiver .",
    "we can see that our glrt dfb receiver achieves the genie bound with @xmath205 , but the gmlsd dfb receiver can not .",
    "is randomly chosen from 10 to 100 . ]    , @xmath206    next , we plot the performance results of the glrt dfb receiver in fig .",
    "[ fg : zoom_uniform ] compared to the glrt sequence receiver .",
    "we can see that the glrt sequence receiver performs slightly better than the glrt dfb receiver when @xmath200 .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , the bep of the glrt dfb receiver can also approach genie bound .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : dfb_ltest ] , we plot the glrt dfb receiver s performance with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be seen that , as @xmath1 increases , the performance approaches the genie bound asymptotically .",
    "based on the results shown in the previous subsection , we have shown that sequence receivers can be implemented using the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm and the selective - store strategy with lower complexity and better performance compared to the msd algorithm .",
    "the error floor problem , which is observed in @xcite and can not be mitigated by the msd algorithm , is now overcome completely .",
    "when @xmath13 is a constant and known at the receiver side and the value of @xmath1 is small , the glrt receivers can not perform as well as the gmlsd receivers , because the glrt receivers always regard the value of @xmath13 as unknown and have to estimate it with insufficient samples .",
    "thus , the gmlsd receivers are suggested only when the receiver memory size is a constraint and the value of @xmath13 is constant and accurately known at the receiver side . otherwise , the glrt receivers , with more robust performance and require no knowledge of @xmath13 , are highly suggested .    though the dfb receivers do not perform as well as their corresponding sequence receivers at the same value of @xmath1 , the dfb receivers",
    "are recommended because of much lower memory requirements .",
    "we always have to preserve several memory arrays for the sequence receivers to store the ongoing part of survivors .",
    "besides , the sequence receivers have a potential to introduce a long system delay when the two survivors are very long before they merge . on the contrary , since the dfb receivers perform symbol - by - symbol detection , memory arrays to store survivors are not necessary and no system delay exists . in addition , we observed that by increasing the value of @xmath1 very slightly , the dfb receiver can perform better than the sequence receiver .",
    "to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence , pointing errors and background radiation , we have introduced new glrt receivers ( the glrt sequence receiver and the glrt dfb receiver ) for fso photon counting systems .",
    "these glrt receivers both can perform ml estimation of the unknown channel gain and background radiation implicitly , and detect the data accordingly , while requiring no prior knowledge about the channel and the environment .",
    "thus , they are robust and work well in any slowly time - varying environment . using the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm as well as the selective - store strategy , the glrt sequence receiver can be implemented efficiently ; while the glrt dfb receiver is a more efficient option . by simulation and theoretical analysis ,",
    "we have shown that the performance of the grt receivers approaches the genie bound as the observation window length increases .",
    "when the background radiation is constant and perfectly known at the receiver side , the performance of the gmlsd receivers ( the gmlsd sequence receiver and the gmlsd dfb receiver ) can also achieve the genie bound as the observation window length increases . by adopting the viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm and the selective - store strategy , for both glrt and gmlsd sequence receivers ,",
    "the error floor problem has been completely avoided .",
    "additionally , in appendix a of this article , we argue that the intuitive detection method will have an error floor problem , and thus is not recommended .",
