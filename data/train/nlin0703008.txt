    "in the last few years , the study of solitary waves in multi - component systems has drawn a large focus of attention both in the physics of bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and in that of nonlinear optical fiber and waveguide arrays @xcite .    in the case of bec dynamics , if the condensates are in a deep optical lattice , then their dynamics can be described by a discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite .",
    "multi - species condensates can arise , in this setting , as mixtures of different spin states in @xmath0rb @xcite and @xmath1na @xcite condensates .",
    "furthermore , theoretical studies have discussed the possibilities of mixtures between different atomic species , such as na ",
    "rb @xcite , k ",
    "rb @xcite , cs  rb @xcite and li  rb @xcite .",
    "a two - species bec , in fact in a @xmath2k@xmath0rb mixture , has been recently reported @xcite ; finally , a mixture of @xmath3li and @xmath4cs was also experimentally investigated @xcite ( albeit in a non - condensed state ) . in the above contexts , the relevant theoretical models , in the presence of an optical lattice trapping @xcite ,",
    "consists of one dnls equation per atomic species .",
    "these equations are coupled by nonlinear cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) ; however , linear coupling terms can also be applied to the description of bec dynamics in this mean - field approximation .",
    "the nonlinear interaction between the components is generated by ( inter - species ) atomic collisions , while linear coupling may be readily induced by an external microwave or radio - frequency field which induces rabi @xcite or josephson @xcite oscillations between populations of the two states .",
    "numerous issues have been considered , especially in the continuum ( i.e. , non - lattice ) counterpart of the above framework . among them , are ground - state solutions @xcite , small - amplitude excitations @xcite , formation of _ domain walls _ ( dws ) between immiscible species @xcite , bound states of dark - bright @xcite and dark - dark @xcite , dark - gray , bright - gray , bright - antidark and dark - antidark @xcite complexes of solitary waves , spatially periodic states @xcite and modulated amplitude waves @xcite among others .",
    "a realization of the above discussed system is quite possible also in the setting of the coupled optical waveguides . in that case , the two species represent either two orthogonal polarizations of light , or two signals with different carrier wavelengths . in the latter case , the linear coupling can also be implemented , by twisting the waveguides or elliptically deforming them , in the case of linear or circular polarizations , respectively . in this context ,",
    "strongly localized vector ( two - component ) discrete solitons have been identified , both in one - dimension @xcite , as well as in two dimensions @xcite . similarly to their continuous counterparts @xcite",
    ", these vector solitons may have components of different types ( bright , dark , or antidark ) .",
    "in particular , symbiotic bright - dark and dark - antidark pairs were predicted in such systems @xcite .",
    "such solitary waves have also been observed experimentally , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these recent developments , on both theoretical and also experimental aspects of such multi - component systems underscore the relevance of further systematic studies of their coherent structures and , importantly , also of their stability .",
    "more specifically , in the discrete setting , the stability of solitary waves in ( a single - component ) dnls and related models was addressed in @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there were no works developing techniques systematically addressing the stability of waves in the context of vector discrete equations .",
    "this formulates the problem that the present study aims at addressing .",
    "in particular , we use as our starting point a vector integrable discretization of @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we then include perturbations , through the inclusion of physically relevant terms , such as ones that appear in the framework of the coupled dnls models or the linear coupling discussed above ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we focus on the influence of such terms on the point spectrum eigenvalues of the linearization around the perturbed solitary waves . to monitor the latter",
    ", we generalize the evans function methodology of @xcite ( see also @xcite for the continuum setting ) to address the vector case and obtain good agreement of the relevant predictions with the qualitative phenomenology and the quantitative dependence on ( the perturbed ) system parameters .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in section 2 , we are going to give the general setup and notation of the coupled equation system . in section 3",
    ", we are going to develop the evans function for the vector case and use it to obtain the eigenvalues in the case of dnls - like perturbations . in section 4",
    ", we are going to give the corresponding results in the presence of linear coupling .",
    "in these two sections , the analytical results will be complemented with numerical computations .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the case of two coupled discrete nls ( cdnls ) equations in the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the step - size of discretization and @xmath8 is the lattice site index .",
    "our motivating physical setting stems from the consideration of coupled hyperfine states of an atomic species ( such as the spin states @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath11 ; see @xcite for relevant details ) , examined in the presence of a quasi - one - dimensional deep optical lattice potential .",
    "a vector generalization of the derivation of @xcite would establish the coupled discrete nls model ( with near - unity nonlinearity coefficients @xcite ) as the appropriate underlying mathematical framework .",
    "however , a starting point that is more tractable analytically is the @xmath12 variant of the above model of eqs .",
    "( [ cdnls ] ) ( i.e. , the `` ablowitz - ladik limit '' @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore study first the existence and stability of discrete solitons for cdnls equations starting from the @xmath12 limit and using continuation in @xmath13 small to examine the persistence of such solutions in the non - integrable limit with the onsite nonlinearity .",
    "we study analytically the stability of discrete solitons of the above coupled system for @xmath14 through the evans method and the properties of reduced discrete dynamical system ( perturbed 4-dimensional mapping ) . based on the integrability of this map",
    "one can provide an analytic expression of the discrete evans function .",
    "concerning small perturbations of integrable cdnls model , we wish to study the stability criteria for discrete solitons and test these predictions against numerical simulations .",
    "we note in passing that this type of discretization does have the relevant manakov continuum limit as @xmath15 , where the equations become @xmath16 up to rescaling of the amplitudes ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) or one of space and time ( i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "notice that this particular discretization is motivated by the wide volume of work on the so - called salerno model @xcite which is also considering a mixed nonlinearity of combined local and nearest - neighbor nonlinear term .",
    "we are interested in stationary solutions of the system of equations ( [ cdnls ] ) and make the ansatz    u_n(t)=q_ne^-2mui1mut , v_n(t)=p_ne^-2mui1mut , [ stationary ]    with a uniform rotation frequency @xmath21 . using equations ( [ stationary ] ) in equations ( [ cdnls ] ) , we arrive at two coupled second  order difference equations    q_n+1+q_n-1&=&q_n -2h^2q_np_n+1+p_n-1&=&p_n -2h^2p_n .",
    "[ map1 ]    for @xmath12 , we obtain the integrable standard  like map with two invariants : @xmath22\\ ] ] @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .    upon setting @xmath25 the steady  state problem for cdnls",
    "can be formulated as    q_n+1&=&(c-1)q_n+r_nh+(-2h^2)q_n(q^2_n+p^2_n)r_n+1&=&(c-1)+r_n+(-2h)q_n(q^2_n+p^2_n)p_n+1&=&(c-1)p_n+s_nh+(-2h^2)p_n(q^2_n+p^2_n)s_n+1&=&(c-1)+s_n+(-2h)p_n(q^2_n+p^2_n ) , [ map2 ] where @xmath26 the equations ( [ map2 ] ) are written so that when @xmath12 , they are then exactly the steady  state problem for integrable cdnls .    when @xmath12 the solutions are given by q_n()&=&(wn+),p_n()&=&(wn+ ) , [ solutions ] with @xmath27 . for small @xmath7 , @xmath28 .",
    "note that these solutions precisely describe the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point @xmath29 , and that these manifolds intersect non  transversely .",
    "this is a non  generic phenomenon for standard - like maps , and hence it is expected that the intersection , if it persists , will be transverse for @xmath30 .    addressing the linear stability of the wave , we set @xmath31 and linearizing cdnls about the wave , one has the linearized problem _ tu__r&= & -l__-u__i_tu__i&= & l__q+u__r+l__qv__r_tv__r&= & -l__-v__i_tv__i&= & l__pu__r+l__p+v__r [ lin - cdnls ]",

    "the starting point used was the analytically available solutions @xcite at the limit of @xmath101 ( i.e. , the integrable limit ) .",
    "upon convergence to the exact numerical solution for finite @xmath99 , numerical linear stability analysis was performed to obtain the spectrum of linearization around the solitary waves .",
    "we observed that as soon as one deviates from the integrable limit , for this nonlinearly coupled case , the effective translational invariance of the discrete model is `` broken '' resulting in the bifurcation of the relevant pair of eigenvalues from the origin of the spectral plane .",
    "this bifurcation will occur along the imaginary axis for the site - centered mode of fig .",
    "[ pfig1a ] , while the eigenvalues will exit as real in the inter - site centered case of fig .",
    "[ pfig2a ] , in accordance with theorem 1 .",

    "we note in passing that another implication of theorem 1 concerns the near continuum limit behavior of the relevant eigenvalues , according to which : @xmath104 for small @xmath7 , which is consistent with the earlier findings of @xcite ( see also references therein about exponentially small splittings of eigenvalues in the presence of discreteness ) .",
    "hence , approaching the continuum limit ( for fixed @xmath99 , and @xmath15 ) , the relevant translational eigenvalue pair would approach @xmath105 , in direct analogy to its scalar case @xcite ( given this analogy , we do not examine this case further ) . in the line of this qualitative analogy (",
    "the quantitative details and relevant constants differ due to presence of two components here ) , theorem 1 can be parallelized to theorem 3.4 of @xcite",
    ".    a further note can be added regarding possible variations of the scattering lengths , which is relevant e.g. , to our motivating example of two hyperfine states of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "slight deviations of the scatterings lengths from their unit values as well as possible changes of the coupling constants among the different components do not change the relevant eigenvalue count ( since they do not affect the symmetries of the problem ) or the over - arching stability conclusions for on - site versus inter - site modes .",
    "in this section , we consider a system of cdnls equations with linear coupling : @xmath106    we are interested in stationary solutions of the system of equations ( [ cdnls ] ) and make the ansatz    u_n(t)=q_ne^-2mui1mut , v_n(t)=p_ne^-2mui1mut , [ stationary1 ]    with a uniform rotation frequency @xmath21 . upon setting @xmath25 the steady  state problem for cdnls can be formulated as    q_n+1&=&(c-1)q_n+r_nh+ h^2 p_n r_n+1&=&(c-2)+r_n+ p_n p_n+1&=&(c-1)p_n+s_nh+ h^2 q_ns_n+1&=&(c-2)+s_n+ h q_n [ map21 ] where @xmath107    the equations ( [ map21 ] ) are written so that , when @xmath108 , they revert to the steady  state problem for integrable cdnls .    the equation of variation with respect to @xmath13 for the stable @xmath67 and @xmath68 manifolds is given ( as in the cdnls ( [ cdnls ] ) by the non - homogeneous problem * y*_n+1= * a*( , n)*y*_n+*g*_n , [ nonhom1 ] where @xmath69 is a uniformly bounded sequence : @xmath109    the distance between stable and unstable manifolds can be calculated by _ ( w^s - w^u)=m_2 ( , h)u^4_n .",
    "[ lmel]@xmath110 is the melnikov sum @xmath111 where the factor @xmath112 in @xmath113 is eliminated because we examine what happens for small @xmath7 and @xmath114^{\\top}\\ ] ] the second  growth mode \" is obtained by solving the inhomogeneous equation .",
    "it is clear that the melnikov sum can be rewritten as @xmath115 where @xmath116 are defined in ( [ solutions ] ) . using the continuum limit of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , one can approximate @xmath119 close to the continuum limit as : @xmath120    combining the above results one has now an expansion of evans function about @xmath59 , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ evans11 ] ) , involving the derivatives @xmath121 and @xmath122 , as the leading terms ; the details are left to the interested reader , being quite similar to those of the previous section .",
    "one then has the following theorem :    consider the stability of the solitary waves associated with the cdnls ( [ lcdnls ] ) for @xmath94 sufficiently small .",
    "the associated linear operator has four eigenvalues at @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , there exists an additional pair of eigenvalues near @xmath59 which are purely imaginary and directly proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "we have tested the above predictions numerically and have found them to be in good agreement with the computational results . in particular , the site - centered and inter - site centered modes are respectively shown in figs .",
    "[ pfig3a ] and [ pfig4a ] for the case of linear coupling ( in order to compare / contrast them with those of nonlinear coupling in figs .",
    "[ pfig1a]-[pfig2a ] ) .",
    "the main thing to notice in this case is that the eigenvalue bifurcation is not only linear in its dependence of the linear coupling parameter @xmath124 , but is furthermore along the imaginary axis for _ both _ the site - centered and inter - site centered solutions .",
    "the latter implies the absence of instability in such linearly coupled cases .",
    "it is important to highlight here a key difference between the linear and nonlinear coupling case , to which this difference in stability properties can be attributed . in the latter case ,",
    "examined previously , the effective translational invariance of the integrable limit was `` destroyed '' upon the action of the nonlinear coupling , while the relevant phase invariances remained intact . on the contrary , in the linearly coupled case",
    ", the translational invariance remains present , while one of the phase invariances is destroyed , as it is now only the sum of the squared @xmath125 norms that is conserved ( rather than each individual one of them ) . as a result",
    ", the source of the bifurcation , and hence the ensuing stability behavior is different in the two cases .",
    "this is also implicitly mirrored in the similar stability behavior of the site - centered and inter - site centered modes .",
    "finally , let us make , in passing , another important observation for the linear case .",
    "for the setting examined above with solutions identical between the two components i.e. , with @xmath126 , it is straightforward to note that the exact solution is analytically available for all values of the linear coupling @xmath123 , as the latter merely renormalizes @xmath127 , by replacing @xmath128 with @xmath129 in the relevant expression .",
    "furthermore , an alternative way to see that the case with the linear coupling should lead to linear dependence of the near @xmath40 eigenvalue pair as a function of @xmath123 is the following .",
    "consider the linear transformation @xcite @xmath130 it is interesting to observe that the equations satisfied by @xmath131 and @xmath132 are those of the _ original _ model i.e. , _ without the linear coupling_. hence , the linear coupling can be `` factored out '' through this transformation , which is motivated by first - order vector systems of ordinary differential equations ( and respected by our manakov - type nonlinearity ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transformation matrix are @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which in turn suggests a linear dependence of the bifurcating pair of eigenvalues on @xmath123 in agreement with our numerical results of figs .",
    "[ pfig3a]-[pfig4a ] .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we have developed the evans function methodology for discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations in the vector case .",
    "we have used as our starting point the integrable discretization of @xcite and have introduced nonlinear , as well as linear perturbations to it breaking different kinds of invariances . as a result ,",
    "pairs of eigenvalues , corresponding respectively to these invariances ( of the linearization around solitary wave solutions of the equation ) have moved away from the origin of the spectral plane .",
    "these pairs have been analytically tracked via the zeros of the evans function and have been found to yield critical information about the stability of the solutions in the non - integrable , perturbed case .    in the nonlinearly coupled case",
    ", an eigenvalue pair corresponding to translations of the solitary waves has been found to bifurcate from 0 , leading to either a stable ( site - centered ) or unstable ( inter - site centered ) solution . on the other hand , in the linearly coupled case , a pair corresponding to the phase invariance of the waves has been found to bifurcate linearly from the origin . in both settings ,",
    "the computed results based on numerical existence and linear stability methods have successfully corroborated the analytical predictions .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the methodology presented herein to the , very intensely studied in recent years , context of photorefractive materials @xcite . in the latter case , the nonlinearity is of the saturable type ( coinciding with the ones studied above for low intensities , but having very different -quasi - linear- behavior at high intensities ) .",
