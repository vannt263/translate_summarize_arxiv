    "energy eigenvalue correlations provide general tools for the statistical description of disordered materials . among them , the nearest neighbour level spacing distribution @xmath5 represents one of the simplest statistics . here , @xmath6 is the energy difference of consecutive eigenvalues @xmath7 divided by the mean level spacing @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , knowing @xmath5 , it is possible to tell whether a given system exhibits metallic or insulating behaviour at temperature @xmath9k .",
    "considerable attention has recently focused on the special case of critical statistics which were found at the metal insulator transition in disordered 3d @xcite and 2d @xcite systems . in all cases ,",
    "the numerically obtained critical level statistics were noticed to be independent of the system size @xmath10 .",
    "this is different in the metallic and insulating regimes where a size dependence has been observed . in the limit @xmath11",
    ", the nearest neighbour spacing distribution follows the poissonian decay , @xmath12 , for disorder strength @xmath13 larger than the critical disorder @xmath14 . the metallic side , @xmath15 , is well described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "as in the metallic phase , the critical @xmath0 depends on the symmetry of the hamiltonian describing the system under consideration .",
    "in addition , and in contrast to the universal rmt description for the metallic phase , the critical @xmath0 depends also on the spatial dimension .",
    "the respective forms of @xmath0 are known only from numerical studies .    in ref.@xcite using the anderson model , the application of an aharonov - bohm - flux was shown not only to change the universality class of the level statistics due to breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that , depending on the strength of the flux , there exists a set of scale independent critical spacing distributions .",
    "these are associated with a continuous crossover from orthogonal to unitary symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the corresponding hamilton matrix can be transformed such that the ab - flux is completely absorbed into the boundary conditions .",
    "so the question arises , whether or not @xmath0 does in general depend on the boundary conditions applied .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath0 is in fact sensitive to a change of the periodic boundary conditions , which were always applied previously , to dirichlet boundary conditions in one , two and three directions .",
    "12.5 cm    in this paper we show that @xmath0 is sensitive to the shape of the sample , too .",
    "we present results of a numerical investigation on various finite size cuboids with square base @xmath16 and height @xmath17 , characterized by the aspect ratio @xmath18 . assuming that a formula for the small-@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath5 , proposed by kravtsov and mirlin @xcite for the metallic regime , may approximately be used at the metal - insulator transition , a dimensionless critical conductance @xmath3 can be extracted from the small-@xmath2 behaviour of the calculated @xmath0",
    "we find that @xmath3 also depends on the sample shape and that the value obtained for the cubic system is in close agreement with a result obtained by a different method .",
    "we investigate the conventional 3d anderson model which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath19 the creation , @xmath20 , and annihilation , @xmath21 , operators act on the states of non - interacting electrons at the sites @xmath22 of a 3d simple cubic lattice .",
    "the disorder energies @xmath23 are chosen to be a set of independent random numbers distributed in the interval @xmath24 $ ] with probability @xmath25 , where @xmath13 denotes the disorder strength measured in units of @xmath26 .",
    "we consider only transfer between nearest neighbour sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions .",
    "the size of the different systems investigated are described by a quadratic base @xmath16 and a height @xmath17 ranging from 8 to 200 lattice constants @xmath27 .",
    "the shape of the system is conveniently denoted by the dimensionless aspect ratio @xmath18 . for all shapes , a size independent metal insulator transition is found at a critical disorder of @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalues used in our study have been taken from an interval @xmath28 $ ] around the band centre .",
    "they are obtained by direct diagonalization using a lanczos algorithm . for each aspect ratio ,",
    "several system sizes are computed with a large number of different realizations of the disorder potentials so that for each particular case the number of eigenvalues exceeded @xmath29 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "the size independent critical level spacing distribution @xmath30 is shown for different aspect ratios : a flat quasi 2d sample ( @xmath31 ) , a cube ( @xmath32 ) , and a long narrow bar ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "deviations of the aspect ratio from @xmath32 , result in critical spacing distributions that seem to approach the poissonian decay , @xmath12 , as @xmath34 ( quasi 2d sample ) or @xmath35 ( quasi 1d sample ) .    to give a more quantitative description ,",
    "we have calculated the second moment @xmath36 of the critical level spacings @xmath37 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the cube ( @xmath32 ) represents the minimum value of the second moment , @xmath38 , whereas @xmath39 for aspect ratios that strongly deviate from the cube .",
    "our value of @xmath40 is in accord with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . from the symmetric appearance of the semi - logarithmic plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it becomes apparent that @xmath41 when crossing @xmath32 .    at present , there exists no complete analytical theory which describes the critical energy level correlations . to compare our results",
    ", we therefore have to put up with a formula proposed recently @xcite for the metallic regime .",
    "the two - level correlation function is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density of states at energy @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 denotes averaging over realizations of the disorder potential . in the metallic regime and for small @xmath2 , @xmath47 becomes @xcite @xmath48 this expression contains corrections to the usual wigner - dyson form in the region @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the thouless energy .",
    "( [ km ] ) depends on the dimensionless conductance @xmath51 , the spatial dimensions , the boundary conditions and also on the shape of the system via the diffusive modes @xcite . for cuboids @xmath52 and periodic boundary conditions",
    "one gets @xmath53 at the critical point , where @xmath54 , the result of the expansion made in ref .",
    "@xcite is expected to give only qualitatively correct behaviour . in order to test this expectation ,",
    "we tentatively assume here that eq .",
    "( [ km ] ) actually holds at the metal insulator transition .",
    "therewith , we are able to extract a shape dependence of the size independent critical conductance @xmath3 from the small-@xmath2 part of the calculated @xmath30 , because for small @xmath2 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the probability density to find exactly @xmath57 eigenvalues within the interval @xmath2 .    the critical conductance as a function of the sample shape is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here ,",
    "the values for @xmath58 and @xmath33 have been omitted , because it was not possible to accurately extract the small-@xmath2 gradient from the data .",
    "again , the already noticed symmetry in replacing @xmath59 when crossing @xmath32 becomes evident .",
    "our result for the cubic system , @xmath60 , agrees very well with the value @xmath61 obtained from the numerical calculation of the kubo - conductivity @xcite .",
    "since the two methods for determining the critical conductance are completely different , the perfect agreement of the numerical values is remarkable .",
    "if this accordance is not mere accidental , it has to be understood why the result of the expansion in ref .",
    "@xcite holds also quantitatively at the critical point . for dirichlet",
    "boundary conditions , we obtain a numerical value @xmath62 for the cubic system .    in mesoscopic systems ,",
    "the decay of @xmath63 accompanied with deviations from the cubic shape may explain some of the different values ( 0.03 - 0.2 ) @xcite reported for measurements on various samples .",
    "however , the question remains to be answered , whether or not the expression for the small-@xmath2 behaviour proposed by kravtsov and mirlin @xcite for the metallic regime is really applicable at the metal insulator transition .    in conclusion ,",
    "a dependence of the scale independent critical level statistics on the shape of the samples has been detected at the anderson transition in 3d systems . using a formula which has been proposed for the metallic regime @xcite to fit our data obtained at the critical point",
    ", we find a shape dependence of the scale independent conductance @xmath3 . provided that this method of extracting the conductance is justified also at the critical point ,",
    "the various experimentally obtained critical conductances reported in the literature can possibly be attributed to different shapes of the samples investigated .",
