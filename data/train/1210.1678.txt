    "possible mechanisms of the interaction between the loops can be magnetic coupling and electro - dynamic coupling through a bias ac .",

    "the aim of this work was to find the largest distance between the loops at which the coupling between quantum magnetic - resistive states of the loops would still occur .",
    "for this purpose , we experimentally studied the quantum magnetic - resistive behavior of two different superconducting aluminum asymmetric circular loops connected in series with a wire of a length ( fig .

    "for a detailed study , fast fourier transformations ( fft ) of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 functions were obtained using 4096 uniformly of distributed points in magnetic fields from -25 to + 25 g ( gauss @xmath70 tesla ) .",

    "let consider now how nonlinear coupling between loops arises and how combination frequencies appear .",
    "nonlinear coupling between directly connected loops can be due to magnetic inductive coupling between loops and electrodynamic interaction through a bias current @xcite .",

    "we assume that in the case of successive loops , the inductive coupling between loops would become much weaker as the distance between the loops increases .",
    "then , the interaction through a bias current should predominate over the inductive coupling in the studied 2-loop structure .",
    "quantum magnetic - resistive properties of a single loop depend both on the loop circulating current and the bias current .",
    "a fraction of the bias current passing through the single loop becomes magnetic - field - dependent , oscillating with a period equal to that of the loop circulating current oscillations ( @xmath135 for the smaller loop and @xmath136 for the larger loop ) . because of the finite spatial change of superconducting order parameter",
    ", the nonlocal the @xmath0 or @xmath1 oscillations can be expected to appear on a wire part located outside of the loop at a distance equal to the nonlocal superconducting length . as shown experimentally and theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nonlocal superconducting length is close to the @xmath137 length .",
    "if the length of a wire connecting two successive loops is shorter than @xmath138 , then it can be expected that some fraction of the oscillating current leaving one of the loops could also pass through the other loop in the 2-loop structure . as a result , current ( voltage ) oscillations with the fundamental frequency @xmath88 corresponding to the smaller loop",
    "could be amplitude modulated by the oscillations with the fundamental frequency @xmath89 corresponding to the larger loop and vice versa .",
    "so , the oscillating current fraction passing through both loops becomes dependent on both loop oscillating currents . as a result",
    ", a nonlinear coupling occurs between quantum magneto - resistive states of the loops .",
    "the amplitude modulation i.e. the multiplication of one oscillating signal by another oscillating signal should be expected to lead to the appearance of combination frequencies .",
    "note that if the distance between the two loops is several times larger than @xmath138 , then one can hardly expect to observe the coupling between the quantum states of the loops . in the 2-loop structure ,",
    "the distance between the loop centers is close to @xmath139 , therefore the coupling can be expected to disappear .",
    "nevertheless , we found the coupling .",
    "here we provide an explanation for the unexpected coupling .",
    "we consider that the 2-loop structure is in a nonequilibrium state with a nonequilibrium length @xmath26 .",
    "then , weak @xmath0 or @xmath1 oscillations can be expected to appear on a wire part located outside of the loop at the distance several times larger than @xmath137 .",
    "in addition , the weak coupling between the quantum states of two loops due to a nonlocal effect can be expected to be observed in the 2-loop structure .    in a nonequilibrium state at distances between the loop centers close to @xmath26",
    ", the coupling can be still noticeable whereas the inductive coupling between the loops should almost disappear .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that the coupling of quantum magnetic - resistive states of both loops mainly occurs through a common bias ac ( dc ) owing to the nonlocal effect .",
    "let us speculate how the quasiparticle overheating can effect on the quantum magneto - resistive behavior of the 2-loop structure . as a result of the quasiparticle overheating ( an increase in the effective local quasiparticle temperature ) @xcite of the structure nonequilibrium region",
    ", an effective nonequilibrium length @xmath26 should be expected to increase .",
    "since the effective resistance of the region is directly proportional to @xmath26 , then , one would expect that the amplitude of the magneto - resistive oscillations would be increased .",
    "moreover , we believe that the quasiparticle overheating can result in an increase in the coupling between the loops . if the overheating would be every strong and the quasiparticle temperature would exceed @xmath3 in the immediate vicinity of the @xmath134 region , then the nonequilibrium region should be expected to transform to the normal - state region with a total size larger then @xmath134 and with an increased resistance .",
    "moreover , the strong overheating periodically driven by the field would result in the giant amplitude of the quantum oscillations that is due to the switching between a state close to the normal state and a state close to the superconducting state .",
    "so , we assume that the overheating not only does nt weaken quantum oscillations , but even can strengthen the oscillations . moreover , it is possible that the overheating can even result in an increase in the loop coupling .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 oscillations is the function of both a bias ac amplitude @xmath57 and a magnetic filed . as was noted above , in low fields @xmath0 oscillations in a single asymmetric circular loop ( in a system of identical loops in series ) @xcite",
    "are of unusual character .",
    "for example , they have a giant amplitude at a bias ac amplitude @xmath57 close to the critical value . in the studied structure ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 oscillations is also unusual in a certain region of low fields . in this region , the oscillation amplitude is maximum and almost independent of the magnetic field [ fig .",
    "[ voltage](d ) ] . outside the region ,",
    "the oscillations first drastically decrease with increasing field and then smoothly fade in high fields [ fig .",
    "[ voltage](d ) ] .    in low fields , the weak magnetic - field dependence of the oscillation amplitude",
    "is probably caused by the overheating of the nonequilibrium region .    in a general case , in low magnetic fields",
    ", the @xmath0 oscillations can not be described @xcite in the framework of the simple gl quasi - one - dimensional theory @xcite , if only the requirement of superconducting fluxoid quantization @xcite is used .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 oscillations in the structure as well as and the maximum magneto - resistive response of a single asymmetric loop are determined by that how close the resistive state of the structure part ( loop ) is to the midpoint of the superconducting - normal ( @xmath8-@xmath140 ) transition @xcite .    on transition from a state close to the superconducting state to a state more close to the midpoint of the @xmath8-@xmath140 transition , the amplitude of @xmath0 oscillations increases in fields close to zero [ figs .",

    "let compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations and their spectra in the 2-loop structure ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ) .",
    "we found both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 voltages measured in the structure under applied ac ( with a zero dc component ) and dc ( with a zero ac component ) respectively , can give information about the structure quantum magneto - resistive states and nonlinear coupling between the loops .",

    "the spectra show quantitative and relative differences between periodic magnetic - field responses of the structure biased with ac ( with a zero dc component ) and dc ( with a zero ac component ) at the same values of @xmath23 and bias current @xmath143 .",
    "the response of the smaller loop often dominated over the one of the larger loop when @xmath0 was measured ( fig . [ voltage ] ) . during @xmath1 measurements , a response of any of the loops could be dominating at certain values of @xmath23 and @xmath67 .",

    "the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations in the structure virtually do not contain higher harmonics of loop fundamental frequencies expect for the second harmonics of @xmath88 . moreover , the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations in the structure exhibit extra peaks at low frequencies and peaks corresponding to extra combination frequencies .",
    "the difference is most appears due to another geometry of the structure as compared to that in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is seen that @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations can be dependent on the field direction .",

    "the asymmetry practically disappears at high bias current values [ fig .",
    "[ voltage](c ) ] .",
    "a similar magnetic asymmetry was first observed in the figure - of - eight - shaped structure @xcite .",
    "we speculate that a possible reason for the asymmetry is in an increase in the termo - dynamical instability in the structure ( the system of the tapscs ) that can be caused by the quasiparticle overheating .",
    "a careful experimental study of the quantum oscillations in a single asymmetric loop would provide us with clues for an acceptable explanation of the asymmetry .",
    "compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations and their spectra in the structure with lp oscillations in a hollow thin - walled superconducting cylinder . in a low field region ,",
    "the oscillations in the structure and those in a single asymmetric loop @xcite are of unusual character .",
    "the striking difference of @xmath1 oscillations in the structure from lp oscillations is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ volt](c ) . in a low field region ,",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath1 oscillations can reach a value close to the total voltage through the whole structure in the normal state , i.e. @xmath144 .",
    "this means that the transition of the structure as a whole from the state close to superconducting to the state close to normal and back can occur at certain field and current values .",
    "the @xmath1 oscillations more resemble abrupt jumps between the superconducting and normal states as magnetic field changes .",
    "we believe that the great amplitude of the @xmath1 oscillations can be due to the periodical magnetic - field - dependent overheating of the nonequlibrium region by tapsc up to the effective quasiparticle temperature slightly above @xmath3 and then by a following cooling of the overheated region to the temperature slightly below @xmath3 .",
    "we found an unexpected interaction ( nonlinear coupling ) between quantum magnetic - resistive states of two superconducting loops in series with a very large distance between the loop centers close to the penetration depth of a nonuniform electric field into a superconductor @xmath145 .",
    "note that according to the present - day studies such an interaction should not be expected in the superconducting aluminum structure of two asymmetric circular loops ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ) .    to detect the interaction we measured both quantum oscillations of a rectified time - averaged direct voltage @xmath0 and a dc voltage @xmath1 in the 2-loop structure .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 curves were recorded for the structure biased only with an alternating current ( without a dc component ) and only with a direct current ( without an ac component ) , respectively , with the maximum current values close to critical and @xmath23 slightly below @xmath3 .",
    "detailed analysis of the oscillations shows that fourier spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 functions contain the sum and difference of the loop fundamental frequencies , which implies an interaction ( nonlinear coupling ) between the quantum states of two loops .",
    "we believe the coupling most likely realizes through a common bias ac ( dc ) due to nonequilibrium nonlocal effects .",
    "the large value of the nonequilibrium length @xmath26 in the structure allow us to observe the coupling between the quantum states of successive loops at a considerable distance between them .",
    "quasiparticle overheating of the structure should be expected to increase in the effective nonequilibrium length and the loop coupling . moreover",
    ", the quasiparticle overheating would result in a great increase in the oscillation amplitude .",
    "earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that measurements of a rectified voltage @xmath0 can be used to determine quantum magneto - resistive states of an asymmetric circular loop and two directly connected asymmetric circular loops @xcite . in this work",
    ", we found that measurements of a dc voltage @xmath1 can be also used to describe the quantum states of the asymmetric structure .",
    "the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations are complicated .",
    "apart from the fundamental frequencies of both loops , summation and difference fundamental frequencies , the spectra contain low and extra combination frequencies .",
    "the extra combination frequencies are linear combinations of the loop fundamental frequencies and low frequencies .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations in the structure radically differ from the lp oscillations .",
    "quasiparticle overheating of the structure should be taken into consideration when the @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations are analyzed .",
    "further investigations would help to elucidate the nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations .",
