    "collisions of composite nuclei involve a complicated interplay and exchange of energy and angular momentum between the relative motion and the intrinsic states of the nuclei .",
    "high precision data for low - energy fusion reactions provide one of the most sensitive tests of such interplay .",
    "stationary state coupled - channels descriptions have provided a natural methodology to study the effects of specific excitation modes of one or both of the reactants on the reaction outcomes .",
    "the wave function in this schrdinger coupled - channels picture is a linear superposition of the states in the model space with a definite phase relationship .",
    "this coherent linear superposition can result in enhancement of the quantum tunneling probability and quantum interference .",
    "the coupled - channels approach has been very successful @xcite in explaining several collision observables .",
    "however , problems remain .",
    "foremost is the inability to describe elastic scattering and fusion measurements simultaneously @xcite and , related , the more recent failure to describe in a physically consistent way the below - barrier quantum tunnelling and above - barrier fusion yields @xcite .",
    "the coupled - channels treatment of collisions of complex nuclei as closed quantum systems is an approximation . in practice , collisions evolve as open quantum systems , with innumerable bound and continuum intrinsic excitations of the nuclei . in analogy with problems of a quantum system in a bath , and following bohr and mottelson @xcite , we view the nuclear many - body hamiltonian as a sum of collective , single - particle and coupling terms . in a nuclear collision ,",
    "the collective part comprises the relative motion of the nuclei and intrinsic rotational and/or vibrational modes .",
    "only a fraction of the hilbert space of this hamiltonian is used in _ any _ feasible full coupled - channels calculation .",
    "this is because the model space is inevitably restricted to selected , most collective intrinsic excitations .",
    "these collective states define a _ reduced _ quantum system .",
    "all other states are _ weakly _ coupled to this reduced system by residual interactions and constitute an  environment \" .",
    "the key question that arises is : do environmental effects influence the reaction dynamics and observables , such as angular distributions of products or tunneling rates ?    in modelling fusion , the  environment \" is assumed to come into play only inside the fusion barrier , and is accounted for in coupled - channels calculations through an imaginary potential or an ingoing wave bounday condition .",
    "however , environmental effects can also be manifested before the nuclei encounter the fusion barrier , for example as real or virtual excitations of giant resonances in the individual nuclei by the long - range coulomb excitation mechanism .",
    "these can be important doorway - states to the irreversible loss of kinetic energy ( heating of the nuclei ) , as first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for deep - inelastic reactions .",
    "another mechanism is complicated multi - nucleon transfer channels @xcite .",
    "measurements have shown that deep - inelastic processes occur even at sub - barrier incident energies @xcite , in competition with the process of quantum tunneling , and thus fusion @xcite .",
    "energy loss associated with the deep - inelastic mechanism thus could play a significant role in the inhibition of tunneling at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "the investigation of the effect , on near- and below barrier fusion , here requires a dynamical model which can include both intrinsic state and environmental couplings in calculations of the tunneling probability .",
    "there are no existing realistic theoretical approaches for solving this problem .",
    "this paper discusses , within a model context , ( 1 ) how environment - induced irreversibility can be incorporated into the successful coupled - channels framework , and ( 2 ) makes a first assessment of its effect on a low - energy nuclear collision .",
    "the application considered is quantum tunneling , relevant to the low - energy nuclear fusion hindrance phenomenon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a brief survey of theoretical approaches to dissipative dynamics of low - energy nuclear collisions , and discuss the suitability of the lindblad axiomatic theory for the treatment of energy dissipation on sub - barrier fusion . in section",
    "iii we present the coupled - channels density matrix approach . numerical results for our model test case are discussed in section iv . finally , the summary of the paper is given in section v.",
    "neither existing models of fusion nor of deep - inelastic scattering can address both energy dissipation and quantum tunneling .",
    "the impact of finite lifetimes of excited states ( e.g. , giant resonances ) on fusion has been studied within a coupled - channels model @xcite , but this approach does not lead to energy dissipation .",
    "direct damped collisions between complex nuclei have also been intensively investigated within various approaches , including : ( i ) transport theories @xcite based on premaster , master , fokker - planck , langevin and diffusion equations , and ( ii ) quantum mechanical collective theories @xcite .",
    "an appealing semi - classical coupled - channels approach combined with a random - matrix model was suggested by ko @xcite , which unifies the statistical and coherent pictures of energy dissipation in deep - inelastic collisions .",
    "this framework has been succesfully applied @xcite to study the excitation of multiphonon giant resonances in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energy . in most of these developments",
    "the relative motion of the nuclei is described with classical trajectories , whilst the coupling to intrinsic degrees of freedom is treated either statistically ( random - matrix theory ) or through phenomenological transport coefficients . however , the quantum mechanical treatment of the relative motion is essential for dealing with quantum tunneling .",
    "the quantum dynamical model presented in this work is based on the time evolution of a reduced density - matrix .",
    "it provides a consistent description of the transition from a pure state to a mixed quantum state during the collision .",
    "the fundamental equation of motion is the liouville - von neumann equation for an open quantum system , in which a dissipative liouvillian accounts for irreversibility due to interactions of the system with an environment .",
    "the lindblad axiomatic approach @xcite for open quantum systems has been successfully applied in nuclear physics , but within rather schematic models .",
    "for instance , to describe the charge equilibration process in deep - inelastic collisions @xcite , fission @xcite , decay of giant resonances @xcite , tunneling through a parabolic barrier @xcite , and scattering in a two - dimensional inverse parabolic potential @xcite . these are calculations for a _ single _ channel of either one damped oscillator @xcite or two coupled damped oscillators @xcite .    in low - energy nuclear collisions ,",
    "the context of the present application , lindblad s dynamics for the evolution of the reduced system is justified ( i ) because the coupling to the complex environment ( through excited doorway - states and determined by residual interactions ) is weak , and ( ii ) because the markov approximation is expected to be valid , the collective motions of the two nuclei being slower than the rearrangement of the environmental ( nucleonic ) degrees of freedom . with increasing collision energy , to well - above the coulomb barrier ,",
    "memory effects related to diabatic dynamics @xcite may be important and a non - markovian liouvillian may be required .",
    "the weak coupling between two subspaces of the total space of intrinsic nuclear states distinguishes between the system and environment .",
    "the lindblad theory does not require @xcite any limitation on the strength of the system - environment coupling , although the definition of physically well - defined environment states would require a careful analysis in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "an essential effect of the environment on the reaction dynamics ( unlike the effect of absorptive terms ) is to progressively destroy the coherent linear superposition and the associated phase relationships between different channels , introducing quantum decoherence in the system .    here , we identify two such ( model ) sources of decoherence and dissipation .",
    "firstly , an environment inside the coulomb barrier , which is related to the complexity of compound nucleus states . secondly , one with effectively a long range , associated with decay out of short lived ( compared to the reaction time ) internal vibrational states , e.g. the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) of the colliding nuclei , will be shown to be of particular importance .",
    "the damping of the gdr , due to its irreversible coupling to a sea of complicated surrounding states , which constitute the environment @xcite , destroys the coherent dynamical coupling with the relative motion of the nuclei .",
    "here we show that damping of the gdr results in decoherence and energy loss in the region where the nuclei overlap , inhibiting tunneling , and thus fusion .",
    "we exploit the time - evolution of a coupled - channels density matrix , as is employed in quantum molecular dynamics @xcite . the density operator @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is represented in an asymptotic ( product ) basis of states of the internal hamiltonian of the individual nuclei , @xmath1 ( lower indices ) , and coordinate states describing the separation of the two nuclei , @xmath2 ( upper indices ) .",
    "that is , @xmath3 crucially , we also add two auxiliary states to the @xmath4 basis that allow distinct environmental interactions , as described below .",

    "here each @xmath12 is a lindblad operator for a dissipative coupling , physically motivated according to the specific problem .",
    "we assume that each coupling @xmath13 between a given state @xmath14 and an environmental state @xmath15 has an associated rate @xmath16 , i.e , @xmath17",
    "@xcite , determined by the inverse lifetime of the excited states and the branching ratio of its de - excitation , taken to be that when the nuclei are well - separated . we note also that : ( a ) the lindblad liouvillian has been derived using microscopic models @xcite , and ( b ) in contrast to many ( dissipative ) model liouvillians @xcite , eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) preserves both the positivity and the trace of the density matrix .",
    "these are essential properties in any realistic application .    in the model calculations that follow ,",
    "the basis will comprise two asymptotic states ( coupled - channels ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 with channel energies @xmath20 .",
    "channel @xmath18 is the ( ground states ) entrance channel and is coupled to an inelastic state @xmath21 by a coupling interaction @xmath22 .",

    "the fusion probability is defined as the probability accumulating in this state @xmath31 .",
    "the second environment , whose explicit treatment will be seen to be the most significant at lower energies , is associated with the irreversible decay out of intrinsic excitations of the colliding nuclei .",
    "such decays are independent of the dynamical couplings . specifically , we will associate the only excited coupled channel state @xmath19 with the gdr excitation .",
    "we then introduce a second auxiliary state @xmath24 , representing the bath of states in which the gdr is embedded , and to which only the gdr excitation @xmath19 is coupled .",
    "thus , @xmath24 and/or @xmath23 supplement the two intrinsic states @xmath18 and @xmath19 that comprise the two coupled channels .",
    "both of the auxiliary states refer to complex excitation modes of the nuclei , associated with nucleonic degrees of freedom and compound nucleus states , respectively .",
