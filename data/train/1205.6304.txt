    "since the discovery of the current accelerating expansion of the universe , both a dark energy ( de ) and a modification of gravity ( mg ) at cosmological scales are the most commonly proposed candidates for explaining cosmic acceleration . it has been proposed that complementary observations of both geometrical tests and the cosmological evolution of the large scale structure ( lss ) formation might reveal the origin of the cosmic acceleration among those models .",
    "it has been known that the flat @xmath3cdm cosmological model which is named to the so - called concordance model of big bang cosmology is consistent with the majority of current cosmological observations including both background evolution ( e.g. supernovae type ia , cosmic microwave background , baryon acoustic oscillation , etc ) and lss growth function ( e.g. redshift space distortions , growth rate of clustering , weak lensing , etc ) .",
    "we re - examine the consistency of the @xmath3cdm model by using the current growth function data .",
    "we also investigate any time variation of the effective gravitational constant from the same data .",
    "the sub - horizon scales linear perturbation of the matter ( @xmath9 ) for many de and mg models is governed by _ + 2",
    "_ = 4 g _ _ _ , [ deltamt ] where dot means the derivatives with respect to cosmic time t , @xmath10 is the mean matter density , @xmath11 is the hubble parameter given by the friedmann equation ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 is the effective gravitational constant obtained from the poisson equation .",
    "@xmath13 becomes newton s gravitational constant @xmath14 in einstein s general relativity .",
    "we change the variable in eq .",
    "( [ deltamt ] ) from @xmath15 to @xmath16 to obtain + ( ) ^2 + = _ ( a ) , [ deltama ] where @xmath17 is the effective equation of state of dark energy and @xmath18 .    the growth function",
    ", @xmath19 is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth factor , @xmath20 which is the growing mode solution of @xmath21 f(a ) _ ( a)^ , [ f ] where @xmath0 is the so - called growth index parameter . for @xmath22 or @xmath23 dark energy models , there exit the exact analytic solutions of @xmath0 at present epoch @xcite _ 0 = / , [ gamma0 ] where @xmath24 is the gamma function , @xmath25 is the hypergeometric function , and @xmath26 is the present value of matter energy density contrast .",
    "thus , for @xmath3cdm @xmath27/(\\gamma[{\\frac{5}{6 } } ] f[{\\frac{3}{2 } } , { \\frac{5}{6 } } , { \\frac{11}{6 } } , 1-\\omo^{-1 } ] ) \\bigr ] \\bigl/ \\ln[\\omo]$ ] and varies from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "there are also exact analytic solutions of @xmath20 for general constant @xmath31 dark energy models and thus one can obtain analytic form of @xmath0 by using eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) @xcite .    in general",
    ", @xmath0 can be a function of time and eq .",
    "( [ deltama ] ) can be rewritten by using @xmath19 and @xmath0 f(a)^2 + f(a ) = .",
    "[ fa ] we adopt the currently available data of the growth function @xmath32 derived from the redshift space distortion parameter @xmath33 and the linear bias @xmath34 in order to constrain the free parameter @xmath0 . however , the data referred as `` '' in table [ table1 ] have the different normalization ( @xmath35 ) and present matter density ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , we adopt a rescaling method given in @xcite in order to transform different growth function to the same fiducial cosmology ( _ ie .",
    "_ , flat @xmath3cdm with @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and denote the quantities obtained from this method with the subscription `` @xmath38 '' .",
    "if one assumes that both the redshift space distortion parameter @xmath39 and the @xmath35 are independent of fiducial model , then one can obtain the relation ( see detail in @xcite ) f_(z ) = f_(z ) .",
    "[ fobs ]    .the currently available data for the growth functions @xmath40 and their re - scaled values @xmath41 .",
    "also we show the derived values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 from @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "after we have compiled a currently available dataset of the growth function from the fiducial concordance @xmath3cdm model for the background evolution , we also re - scale the values of the observed growth function .",
    "we constrain the several phenomenologically parameterized growth index parameter @xmath0 allowing time variation of it .",
    "theoretically , almost the constant @xmath0 is expected from the @xmath3cdm model , but the best model from original data produces @xmath44 with the best fit values @xmath45 and @xmath46 with and without 2 slaq and lyman-@xmath47 data , respectively . the reduced @xmath4 values are both 0.74 . when we use the rescaled values of @xmath19 , then the best fit values are @xmath48 and @xmath49 with and without 2 slaq and lyman-@xmath47 data , respectively",
    ". the reduced @xmath4 values are 0.48 and 0.28 , respectively .",
    "even though the constant @xmath0 model includes the @xmath3cdm expected value of @xmath50 at 1-@xmath5 level , this gives the worse fit compared to other models for all data .",
    "we also investigate the time variation of the effective gravitational constant proposed by modified gravity theories .",
    "it is interesting to find that the effective gravitational constant is smaller than the newton s gravitational constant @xmath51 for @xmath8 for all considered models at 3-@xmath5 level .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the current large scale structure formation shows the deviation from einstein s general relativity @xmath3cdm with 99 % confidence level .",
    "the current growth rate observations show the deviation from einstein s general relativity . by using the previous data with @xmath52 % accuracies and wigglez galaxy survey within @xmath53 % , the errors in @xmath0 parameters are about 15 % and 60 % for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
