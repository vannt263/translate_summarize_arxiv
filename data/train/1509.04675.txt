    "keplerian disks are often observed around young stellar objects and are considered to be sites of planet formation ( e.g. , williams & cieza 2011 ) . such disks are also observed around sources at even earlier evolutionary stages , class 0 and i protostars , which are still embedded in dense envelopes ( e.g. , tobin et al .",

    "the keplerian disks around these class 0 and i protostars have radii ranging from 50 au to 350 au and masses from 10@xmath11 @xmath12 to 10@xmath8 @xmath12 , which are similar to disks around young stellar objects ( e.g. , simon et al .  2000 ; pitu et al .",
    "the comparable disk masses and sizes around class 0 and i protostars and young stellar objects suggest that keplerian disks can be well developed at an early evolutionary stage of star formation . in our study of gas motions on a 1000 au scale around 17 class 0 and 0/i protostars using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , we found that 13 out of the 17 sources could exhibit keplerian disks with a size scale @xmath13100 au ( yen et al .",
    "opposite to this , the following group of class 0 protostars is showing no sign that such 100 au keplerian disks have formed : b335 ( yen et al .  2010 , 2015 ) , ngc 1333 iras 4b ( yen et al .",

    ". the protostellar envelopes on a 1000 au scale around these protostars do not show clear rotational motions , suggesting that the specific angular momenta in their envelopes are likely small . because of these small specific angular momenta ( @xmath1410@xmath15 km s@xmath8 pc ; yen et al .",
    "2015 ) , the outer radii of their keplerian disks ( if present ) are likely less than 10 au .",
    "therefore , based on the current studies with limited sample sizes ( e.g. , yen et al .",
    "2015 ) , one fifth of class 0 protostars could be without well developed keplerian disks .",
    "a keplerian disk is expected to form when collapsing material rotates fast enough around a protostar to become rotationally supported ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "if the angular momentum of the collapsing material is conserved , this material will rotate faster as it approaches the protostar . in this way ,",
    "a keplerian disk is naturally formed ( e.g. , ulrich 1976 ; cassen & moosman 1981 ; terebey et al .",
    "1984 ; basu 1998 ; bate 1998 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the size of a keplerian disk grows as more angular momentum is transferred to the disk by the collapsing material . a keplerian disk with a radius of 100 au",
    "can then form within 10@xmath16 yr ( e.g. , yen et al .",
    "this is comparable to the time scale of the class 0 stage ( enoch et al .",
    "2009 ; dunham et al .",
    "2014 ) . on the contrary , if magnetic fields are incorporated , theoretical studies show that the magnetic fields can slow down the infalling velocity of collapsing material , remove its angular momentum , and suppress the formation and growth of keplerian disks .",
    "this mechanism can be very efficient . as a result ,",
    "no keplerian disk with a size larger than 10 au can form ( e.g. , allen et al .",
    "2003 ; mellon & li 2008 , 2009 ; machida et al .",
    "2011 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ; dapp et al .",
    "recent high - resolution magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation show that a small rotationally - supported disk with a size of a few au can form at the early evolutionary stage of star formation ( e.g. , machida et al .",
    "2014 ; tomida et al .",
    "although these simulations do not continue to follow the growth of that small disk due to computational limitations , these studies expect that the disk size will eventually grow to tens of au with a proceeding collapse .",
    "however , keplerian disks with sizes larger than tens of au have been observed around several class 0 and i protostars .",
    "observationally , it is , thus , not yet clear when and whether or not efficient magnetic braking is occurring during the star formation process .    to investigate the formation process of keplerian disks around class 0 protostars , we conducted observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) toward b335 , which is one of the class 0 sources showing no clear sign of rotational motion on a 1000 au scale ( yen et al .  2010 , 2015 ) .",

    "figure [ jr ] shows that the behavior of the radial profile of the specific angular momentum in b335 is generally consistent with the scenario of an inside - out collapse of a rotating dense core . in this scenario ,",

    "these estimates are all based on the velocity features of the infalling motion but not on resolved keplerian rotation .",
    "therefore , the estimated protostellar masses more likely present the corresponding gravity that pulls gas toward the center instead of the genuine protostellar mass .",
    "the comparison shows that the estimated protostellar masses decrease with spatial scales .",
    "this can hint that the net gravity pulling gas inward decreases in the inner regions .",
    "in other words , the infalling velocity on a smaller scale can be more significantly slower than the free - fall velocity@xmath18 , leading to a smaller estimated protostellar mass .",
    "possible explanations for this are contributions such as turbulence , thermal pressure , magnetic pressure , or magnetic tension , that become more significant and work against gravity .",

    "our results , thus , possibly hint that the angular momentum of the infalling material on a 1000 au scale in b335 is partially removed .    the comparison of the gas motions on scales from 0.1 pc to the inner 100 au hints that the net force pulling gas inward possibly decreases in the inner region , and the angular momentum of the infalling material is likely partially removed during the infalling motion . both phenomena are shown in mhd simulations of collapsing dense cores ( e.g. , mellon & li 2008 , 2009 ; li et al .",
    "as the magnetic field is dragged toward the inner region with the infalling motion , the magnetic field tension and pressure become more important and can slow down the acceleration of the infalling material .",
    "in addition , the thermal pressure can also be enhanced in the inner region , if there is substantial material collapsing vertically along the magnetic field to the equator ( e.g. , mellon & li 2008 ) .",
    "observationally , such infalling velocities slower than the free - fall velocities by 30% to 50% have been seen in several protostellar sources , such as l1527 irs ( ohashi et al .",

    ", the magnetic field can be twisted .",
    "the twisted field can then remove angular momentum of the infalling material and transfer it outward , leading to the so - called `` magnetic braking '' .",
    "although ( isotropic ) turbulent or thermal pressure can also work against gravity , it is unlikely that they develop a preferential direction to slow down the azimuthal motion ( i.e. , rotational motion ) .",
    "therefore , our alma results could suggest that the gas motions in b335 are slowed down by the magnetic field .",
    "if the difference between the expected and observed specific angular momentum at a radius of @xmath3100 au is indeed caused by magnetic braking , we can estimate the order of magnitude of the required magnetic field strength . assuming the system has reached steady state ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , the change in angular momentum can be approximated as @xmath116 where @xmath67 is the infalling velocity , @xmath117 is the amount of angular momentum removed , @xmath118 is the distance over which the infalling material has been slowed down due to magnetic braking of the vertical and azimuthal field components @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( krasnopolsky & knigl 2002 ) . as estimated from our kinematic models for the c@xmath0o emission , at @xmath121 au , @xmath67 is @xmath31 km s@xmath8 , @xmath99 is 2 @xmath6 10@xmath122 @xmath123 .",

    "the orientations of the magnetic field from large to small scales in b335 are observed .",

    "the outflow axis can be considered as the rotational axis .",
    "hence , b335 possibly shows all signs of magnetic braking , i.e. , no sign of a keplerian disk larger than 10 au and a magnetic field aligned with the rotational axis in its dense core .",
    "this is all consistent with expectations from mhd simulations .",
