    "with the unprecedented detection of the transient gravitational - wave ( gw ) signal gw150914 on september 14 , 2015 by the two advanced - ligo interferometers  @xcite gw astronomy has finally become a reality .",
    "the signal , that was detected at a peak gw strain of @xmath0 , matches consistently numerical relativity waveforms  @xcite for the final few cycles ( chirp ) and merger ( burst ) of the coalescence of two stellar - origin black holes in a binary system , along with the subsequent ringdown signal of the resulting final black hole .",
    "the statistical significance of the observation has been reported to be greater than @xmath1  @xcite .    for coalescing compact binary signals such as gw150914 ,",
    "the inspiral part of the signal can be detected by either targeting a broad range of generic transient signals or by correlating the data with analytic waveform templates from general relativity and maximizing such correlation with respect to the waveform parameters .",
    "when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the filter output over a wide bandwith of the detector exceeds an optimal threshold , the matched - filtering technique generates a trigger associated with a specific template . for low snr signals , the inherent non - stationarity and non - gaussanity of the detector noise renders however the identification of the signal fairly challenging . in the case of gw150914 , with a snr of 24 , two independent waveform reconstructions were applied in  @xcite namely a binary black hole template waveform from  @xcite and a bayesian approach based on a linear combination of sine - gaussian wavelets and a parameterized model of non - stationary , non - gaussian noise  @xcite . with the advent of _",
    "real _ gw data for the first time , it is worth investigating how approaches for gw reconstruction and denoising _ alternative _ to those used in  @xcite do actually perform .",
    "that is the aim of this paper .",
    "more precisely , we present in this work the results of applying total variation ( tv ) denoising techniques on the publicly available waveform data for gw150914 and compare our findings with the waveform reconstruction methods reported in  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite we recently presented such tv - norm regularized methods for denoising and detection of gws embedded in additive gaussian noise . in our approach , a new regularization term is added to the error function ( fidelity ) , weighted by a positive lagrange multiplier which measures the relative importance of the data - dependent fidelity term .",
    "key to this new approach is the fact that the regularization strategy is based on a @xmath2-norm , whose main advantage is that it favors _ sparse _ solutions . in this paper",
    "we propose an iterative procedure to solve denoising problems based on the so - called regularized rudin - osher - fatemi ( rrof ) algorithm ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the rrof method runs a new scale space from finer to coarser scales , with a termination criterion given by a discrepancy principle .",
    "usually , this criterion is enforced by matching the square of the @xmath3-norm of the residual with the variance of the noise , if the latter is known .",
    "since this is not the case for gw data , our iterative procedure is terminated as soon as the reconstructed signal starts to loose amplitude around local extrema . as we show below",
    ", this procedure returns an accurate denoising of the signal gw150914 .",
    "the interested reader is addressed to  @xcite and references therein for details and applications of tv - denoising methods in fields as diverse as medical imaging , radar imaging , and magnetic resonance imaging , and to our previous work  @xcite for the first specific application of this method in numerically - simulated gw signals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section : method ] we briefly summarize the main aspects of our numerical procedure .",
    "next , in section  [ section : results ] we present the results of applying our tv - denoising method to gw150914 and compare with the waveform reconstructions reported in  @xcite .",
    "finally , section [ section : summary ] presents the conclusions of our study .",
    "we start by providing an overview of our tv method .",
    "full details are presented in ref .",
    ". we shall assume the general linear degradation model @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed signal , @xmath6 is the noise and @xmath7 is the signal to be recovered .",
    "signal denoising stands for estimating a noise - free signal @xmath7 whose square of the @xmath8-distance to the observed noisy signal @xmath5 is the variance of the noise , i.e. latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : fidelity_term }    the standard deviation of the noise .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath3 norm ( i.e.  least squares ) models to solve the denoising problem present deficiencies such as the appearance of gibbs phenomena or non - unique solutions . those are overcome by regularizing the least squares problem using an auxiliary energy ( ` prior ' ) @xmath10 , and solving a constrained variational problem @xmath11 where the functional @xmath10 measures the quality of the signal @xmath7 , namely  the smaller @xmath10 the cleaner the signal . if the energy @xmath10 is convex , problem ( [ eq : constrained ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "interestingly , there exists an unconstrained version of the variational problem , obtained by adding the constraint ( the  fidelity term \" ) weighted by an unknown , positive lagrange multiplier @xmath12 to @xmath10 @xmath13 a procedure known as tikhonov regularization",
    ". there exists a unique value of @xmath12 such that the unique solution @xmath7 matches the constraint .",
    "rudin , osher and fatemi proposed in @xcite the tv norm as regularizing functional for the variational model for denoising ( [ eq : unconstrainl2 ] ) @xmath14 where the integral is defined on the domain of the signal  ) in which @xmath15 . ] .",
    "therefore , the rof model amounts to solving the following variational problem for denoising : @xmath16 the tv norm energy is essentially the @xmath2-norm of the gradient of the signal .",
    "thus , the rof model reduces noise by _ sparsifying _ the gradient of the signal and avoiding spurious oscillations ( ringing ) .    in this paper",
    "we use a regularized rof algorithm by solving the associated euler - lagrange equation of an energy that includes a smoothed tv norm ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the rrof algorithm is used as a building block of an iterative procedure that runs the scale space from the original noisy signal to the processed signal . roughly speaking , we first choose the regularization parameter @xmath17 equal to a constant value @xmath18 , which is larger than the optimal value needed to obtain a denoised signal by means of the application of the rrof algorithm .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is kept fixed through all the iterations .",
    "next , we compute @xmath19 by solving @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the residual . then",
    ", we apply again the rrof algorithm using the same @xmath18 and taking as input signal @xmath19 to obtain @xmath22 . we thus have @xmath23 applying this procedure for an arbitrary number of times @xmath6 we obtain a sequence of signals @xmath24 for @xmath25 such that @xmath26 the iteration stops when some discrepancy principle is satisfied , i.e.  when the square of the @xmath3-norm of the residual matches the variance of the noise . in practice , however , the variance of the noise is not available and we have to resort to some other termination criterion .",
    "therefore , the iterative procedure is stopped at some @xmath27 which is selected to make it coincide with the appearance of the denoised signal before its local extrema start loosing total variation .",
    "we regard signal @xmath28 as the denoised signal .",
    "note that the scale space defined by this iteration is different from the one observed when the parameter @xmath17 runs from small to larger values , as it is done in the bregman refinement iterative algorithm ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of using the iterative procedure proposed here is that local extrema and edges are significantly better preserved when the scale space is run in the opposite direction ( towards smaller values of @xmath17 ) .",
    "+            we turn to describe the results of applying the rrof method in the time domain to the strain time - series data associated with the gravitational wave event gw150914 .",
    "these data have been released by the ligo open science center  @xcite .",
    "our method is transparent to the sampling frequency of the data .",
    "gw150914 data are sampled at both 4 khz and 16 khz .",
    "we have found that our results are very similar for both sampling frequencies .",
    "therefore , for efficiency reasons , our analysis is performed using data corresponding to a sample frequency of 4 khz .    to assess our denoising procedure we have tried to use as few assumptions about instrumental noise as possible , due to the fact that the detector noise is non - gaussian and non - stationary . however , a minimum noise preprocessing is required due to two main reasons .",
    "on the one hand there are well - known , modeled sources of narrow - band noise , such as the electric power ( at 60 hz and higher harmonics ) , mirror suspension resonances or calibration lines ( see fig .  3 of  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "ground - based detectors such as ligo are not sensitive to low frequencies because of seismic noise .",
    "therefore , we highpass the time series above 30 hz to remove seismic noise and , following  @xcite we also filter out all spectral lines of both detectors .",
    "once the time - series has been preprocessed , we apply the rrof method in the time domain using the iterative procedure described in the previous section . as we did in  @xcite , to ensure the best conditions for the convergence of the algorithm and to avoid round - off errors , the data are normalized to vary between -1 and 1 before the application of the algorithm .",
    "we choose a relatively high value of the regularization parameter @xmath18 , larger than the optimal value ( see  @xcite ) , namely @xmath29 .",
    "our analysis shows that less than 10 iterations are enough to denoise the signal and obtain an accurate and smooth result .",
    "we note that we can also apply the algorithm with a single iteration using the  optimal \" value of the regularization parameter , significantly lower than the selected @xmath18 . as we showed in  @xcite",
    ", the use of low values of @xmath17 leads to larger noise removal and more smooth - looking results ( suppressing high - frequency noise in the denoised signals ) .",
    "however , we already noticed that for gravitational waveform templates of binary black holes embedded in gaussian noise , low values of @xmath17 can not capture properly the high frequency part of the signal , i.e.  the merger and the ringdown ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the iterative procedure we employ here for the first time allows us to remove noise in a more progressive way while capturing at the same time the high - frequency part of the signal .",
    "+    the denoised waveforms for both the hanford and livingston ligo detectors are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] . for both detectors the waveforms look remarkably similar , especially in the last few cycles of the signal . comparing these denoised waveforms with the filtered waveforms reported in",
    "@xcite we notice that the latter show high - frequency features visible in some of the final cycles before the merger that do not appear in our results . by reducing the number of iterations to about 3 - 5 and decreasing the value of @xmath17 ,",
    "our rrof algorithm does not entirely smooth out higher frequencies locally which results in a somewhat closer similitude between both sets of waveforms .    in order to make a fair comparison , we have applied the rrof method to both , the observed data and to the same numerical relativity waveform employed by  @xcite .",
    "this comparison is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] .",
    "the shape of the denoised waveform agrees with the shape of the processed numerical relativity waveform template of  @xcite for the last 4 cycles and the ringdown part of the signal  . to have a quantitative measure of the quality of our results , we calculate the mean square error ( mse ) between our denoised waveform and the numerical relativity waveform in the time interval shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] .",
    "we also perform the same calculation with the data resulting from applying a whitening process to the original h1 and l1 data and filtering them with a 35 - 350 hz bandpass filter . for the hanford detector",
    "our results yield a mse value of @xmath30 while for the whitened and filtered data the mse value is @xmath31 .",
    "these low values of the mse show that both methods remove noise successfully .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also computed the spectrograms ( time - frequency diagrams ) of the waveforms for our denoised signals .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrogram ] for the signals of both detectors .",
    "the superimposed isocontours appearing in both spectrograms correspond to the numerical relativity waveform .",
    "these lie on top of the time - frequency diagrams of the denoised signals .",
    "the distinctive increase in frequency during the final cycles of the chirp signal is clearly recognizable in both spectrograms .",
    "our results are again similar to the results reported by  @xcite .",
    "we have applied a regularized rudin - osher - fatemi total variation algorithm to denoise the transient gravitational wave signal gw150914 detected on september 14 , 2015 by the two advanced - ligo interferometers .",
    "our goal has been to assess if the rrof algorithm applied in the time domain to real gravitational wave data can successfully remove noise without any a priori information about the signal .",
    "we have recently applied tv - denoising techniques to numerically generated gravitational waves embedded in additive gaussian noise , obtaining satisfactory results irrespective of the signal morphology or astrophysical origin  @xcite .",
    "the results reported in this paper show that the non - gaussian , non - stationary noise from an actual observation such as the gravitational wave event gw150914 can also be successfully removed with tv - denoising methods .",
    "the quality of the denoised waveform is comparable to that obtained with the bayesian approach used in the discovery paper  @xcite .",
    "tv - denoising techniques may offer thus an additional viable approach for waveform reconstruction . as we already pointed out in  @xcite tv - denoising algorithms",
    "should also be useful to improve the results of other data analysis approaches such as bayesian inference or matched filtering when used as a noise removal initial step that might induce more accurate results for those other methods . with the potential increase in the wealth of new gravitational wave data in the near future , investigating the performance of tv - denoising methods such as",
    "the iterative rrof algorithm presented in this work , particularly in less favourable snr conditions than those present in gw150914 , deserves further analysis .",
