    "few - electron quantum dots are paradigmatic systems to investigate the effects of coulomb interaction and quantum fluctuation in nanoscale systems",
    ".  @xcite the theorist s workhorse in this field is the so - called anderson - impurity model , consisting of a single spin - degenerate level with onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath0 , tunnel coupled to non - interacting leads . in this type of systems ,",
    "the energy scale associated with coulomb repulsion is usually large and consequently interaction effects can not be treated within a perturbative scheme .",
    "however , when the tunnel coupling between dot and leads is smaller than temperature or voltage , a perturbation theory in the tunnel coupling strength , here denoted by @xmath1 , can be successfully employed .",
    "transport in lowest order ( sometimes referred to as the sequential tunneling ) can in many cases be understood by a straightforward master - equation approach with transition rates computed by means of fermi s golden rule ,  @xcite see for example ref .  .",
    "in this so - called orthodox theory , energy conservation allows only for transitions between energetically degenerate states , and we refer to them as classical or on - shell transitions .",
    "higher - order transport corrections are associated with quantum fluctuations or off - shell transitions . in second order in @xmath1 , there are two different types of quantum - fluctuation corrections . first , there are cotunneling processes .",
    "they consist of a sequence of two tunneling events with an intermediate virtual state ( i.e. , the energy of the intermediate state is not equal to the energy of the initial and final state ) .",
    "cotunneling dominates transport in the coulomb - blockaded regions .",
    "@xcite some of the cotunneling processes , e.g. spin flips , occur already at zero voltage , other effects were predicted to contribute at large bias voltage , e.g. inelastic cotunneling  @xcite and pair tunneling .",
    "@xcite the second type of quantum - fluctuation corrections are described by renormalizations of the system parameters , namely the dot energies and the tunnel - coupling strengths .",
    "they lead to shifted positions and modified tunneling strengths at the transport resonances as a function of gate voltage . in many cases , these renormalizations yield only small corrections to the lowest - order contribution to , e.g. , the conductance .",
    "there are , however , also scenarios in which the renormalization corrections are of crucial importance , because the lowest - order contribution either vanishes ( as it is , e.g. , the case for certain schemes in adiabatic pumping through single - level quantum dots  @xcite ) or provides a flat background only ( as , e.g. , in the maximal linear conductance through a metallic single - electron transistor , where a logarithmically temperature - dependent conductance indicated multichannel kondo behavior  @xcite ) .",
    "any theoretical approach that takes systematically all contributions to a given order in perturbation expansion into account will automatically include both cotunneling and renormalization effects , and , thus , go beyond pure cotunneling as obtained from standard second - order perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite this is true , e.g. , for the diagrammatic real - time approach , see refs .",
    ", that was developed to describe transport through quantum - dot systems . in this case , however , the renormalizations can only be read off a posteriori by bringing the final result of the considered quantity ( e.g. , the linear conductance ) into a form that allows for an identification of the renormalizations .",
    "we show in this paper that the linear conductance , as one possible measurable quantity to be considered , reveals these renormalization effects ; however , care has to be taken , since an identification relying only on the conductance may not be unique .",
    "therefore , we introduce in this paper an a priori procedure to classify and evaluate the various quantum - fluctuation corrections . this procedure is based on a canonical transformation that removes off - shell parts of the hamiltonian and , simultaneously , generates new transitions describing cotunneling as well as renormalization of the system parameters .",
    "the main emphasis of this paper is on the derivation of the explicit expression for the renormalization of the tunnel coupling strength .",
    "as a specific example , we consider a single - level quantum dot with coulomb interaction weakly coupled to two reservoirs .",
    "since we are interested in the linear conductance , a small bias voltage can be applied between the two reservoirs .",
    "the system consisting of quantum dot and leads is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 the single - particle level spacing in the dot is assumed to be larger than any other energy scale ( temperature , coulomb interaction , transport voltage ) such that only one energy level needs to be taken into account .",
    "hence , the dot can be described by the single - level anderson model @xmath3 the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath4 on the dot is given by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the corresponding number operator .",
    "the onsite repulsion @xmath0 ( as found from the constant interaction model  @xcite ) describes the energy cost for double occupation and stems from coulomb interaction .",
    "tunneling of electrons between dot and leads is taken into account by @xmath7 we assume a momentum- and spin - independent tunnel matrix element @xmath8 and define the creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath9 for electrons with spin @xmath4 and momentum @xmath10 in lead @xmath11 .",
    "the leads hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the chemical potential of the two leads differs by the applied bias @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the electron charge .",
    "we assume that the density of states @xmath15 in the leads is constant in the window relevant for transport and define the tunnel coupling strength @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the ( reduced ) hilbert space for the quantum dot is spanned by the states @xmath19 for an empty dot , @xmath20 for a singly - occupied dot with spin @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for a doubly - occupied dot .",

    "for a systematic analysis of quantum - fluctuation effects due to tunneling , we split the hamiltonian into three parts ; a term in the absence of tunnel coupling , @xmath28 , and two different types of tunneling , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 the dot and the reservoirs in the absence of tunneling are described by @xmath32 the tunneling part of the hamiltonian introduces couplings between different eigenstates @xmath26 and @xmath33 .",
    "we distinguish on - shell contributions , @xmath34 which couple states of the same energy , @xmath35 , from the off - shell parts , @xmath36 which connect states with different energies , @xmath37 . in both cases ,",
    "we have used the abbreviation @xmath38    the rates for classical ( on - shell ) transitions between two states @xmath26 and @xmath33 are obtained via fermi s golden rule in first order in the tunnel coupling @xmath1 corresponding to second order terms in @xmath39 , @xmath40 where the kronecker delta ensures energy conservation . as a consequence , only the transitions described by the on - shell part @xmath29 need to be considered . in order to find the transition rate between two states of the dot subsystem , an average over all possible initial lead states has to be performed .",
