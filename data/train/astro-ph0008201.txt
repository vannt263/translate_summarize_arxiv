    "small groups of galaxies are important cosmological indicators of the distribution and properties of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "they occupy the mass and velocity range between individual galactic halos and the large halos of rich galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the rms velocity dispersion of groups is only somewhat larger than that of individual galaxies , but groups have the advantage that visible galaxy tracers extend throughout the dark matter halo . at intermediate redshift",
    ", groups are suitable targets for x - ray observation and weak gravitational lensing studies which are complementary probes of their contents .. consequently groups can be used to probe the properties of the dark matter on scales and at velocities much smaller than can be examined in galaxy clusters .",
    "the theory of structure growth in the universe is based on the paradigm that the dark matter consists of collisionless particles that only interact via the gravitational force .",
    "cold dark matter is a specific form of this hypothesis that has been subjected to intensive theoretical study .",
    "a particular strength is that the properties of virialized halos can be predicted from a given density perturbation spectrum to full nonlinearity via simulations and various analytic approximations .",
    "these predictions have been tested with varying degrees of success against the dark matter halos of individual galaxies and rich clusters , but are less examined on intermediate scales .",
    "the intermediate scales are interesting because they are at much higher phase space densities than massive galaxy clusters , yet their central dark matter densities are not overwhelmed and altered by the baryonic matter , as is the case in for most normal galaxies .",
    "the cdm theory gives specific predictions of the statistical properties of the dark halo population and the mean internal properties of individual halos . the press - schechter theory ( 1974 , hereafter ps )",
    "predicts the numbers of halos as a function of mass or velocity dispersion . at low redshift ,",
    "suitably selected groups have a population volume density in accord with the cluster - normalized ps prediction @xcite .",
    "a second global statistic is the clustering of dark matter halos which is predicted using analytic approximations which have been compared to n - body results @xcite .",
    "this biased `` peaks '' theory predicts a slow increase of clustering strength with halo mass .",
    "the internal density structure of the halos is found in simulations to have a power law cusp , @xmath4 to @xmath5 which asymptotically steepens to approximately @xmath6 beyond the virial radius @xcite .",
    "the goals of this paper are to find a collection of virialized groups and then to compare the predictions of the global statistics and internal structure of intermediate mass dark matter halos to the observationally derived properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes our approach to identifying groups in a redshift catalogue .",
    "section 3 gives an overview of the canadian network for observational cosmology s field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) and the virialized groups that we find . in ",
    "4 the number - velocity dispersion relation and the two - point correlation function are computed and compared to dark matter halo predictions . in ",
    "5 we `` stack '' the groups on their centers and measure the mean projected density distribution and projected velocity distribution . in  6 we model these as projections of simple 3d systems to derive the mean mass density profile and mass - to - light ratio as a function of radius which leads to the discovery that groups have a rising mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we examine the rising mass - to - light ratio for various galaxy sub - populations to search for systematic trends that might point to its physical origin .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possible implications of these results and a short set of empirical conclusions .",
    "we use @xmath7 throughout this paper and adopt @xmath8 as our reference cosmological model . the distances and transverse lengths",
    "would be about 8% larger in an @xmath9 cosmology at the median redshift .",
    "a group is defined here as a collection of three or more galaxies , above some minimum luminosity , that meets a set of positional requirements designed to minimize chance associations .",
    "one might seek , say , bound groups , such as the low overdensity local group , or , virialized groups , which are collapsed and hence quite dense .",
    "virialized groups are a high density subset of bound groups and are the aggregates of interest in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , in redshift space there is a fundamental degeneracy between position and line of sight velocity .",
    "consequently , the precise galaxy membership of a group found in redshift space is always a statistical issue .",
    "most group search methods are based on the friends - of - friends ( f - o - f ) algorithm used by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) .",
    "this is an important method that gives unique groups , independent of starting galaxy .",
    "the f - o - f algorithm can be tuned to yield groups of varying overdensity .",
    "the algorithm starts with any galaxy as the beginning of a trial group .",
    "all galaxies closer than some maximum distance ( discussed below ) are added to the group .",
    "then , each of the new group members is in turn used as a center to search for its neighbors to add to the growing group , continuing until no more new neighbors are found .",
    "then one proceeds to a previously un - examined galaxy to try to start a new group .",
    "this process continues until all galaxies have been examined for neighbors .",
    "groups of one and two are then deleted from the catalogue .",
    "the f - o - f algorithm has two parameters in redshift space : a maximum separation in projected radius , @xmath10 , and either a maximum separation velocity , @xmath11 , or co - moving redshift space distance difference , @xmath12 , required to join the group .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters are related through @xmath13 .",
    "we use @xmath14 for kinematic measurements and @xmath15 for group finding .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath12 parameters need to be mutually adjusted to take into account the mean volume density of the survey , @xmath16 , so as to produce an overdensity with respect to the field chosen on the basis of an experimental goal with an allowance for redshift space blurring .",
    "the resulting galaxy overdensity in the cylindrical redshift space search volume is , @xmath17 ^ 2 \\,\\rzmax",
    "\\,n(z)}}. \\label{eq : od}\\ ] ] the @xmath12 parameter needs to be chosen in relation to @xmath10 with some care .",
    "one approach is to tune it to n - body simulation results @xcite .",
    "however , an ever - present issue is that the resulting group sizes and velocity dispersions tend to correlate with the @xmath10 and @xmath12 parameters .",
    "here we are interested exclusively in virialized groups , suggesting we devise a variant of the basic f - o - f algorithm which selects groups that appear to be sufficiently dense that they will quickly virialize . in configuration space",
    "virialization demands a mean interior density of approximately @xmath18 @xcite , equivalent to nearly @xmath19 in a low density , flat cosmology .",
    "a conventional approximation is that such groups will be contained inside the radius @xmath20 which can be estimated from the virial theorem as @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and @xmath23 is the hubble constant at the redshift of interest @xcite . for a given @xmath22",
    "the virialized group members will be , on the average , contained with approximately @xmath24 if the mean density is falling like @xmath6 .",
    "this relation between velocity and projected separation immediately suggests a natural range for the parameters .",
    "the field pairwise velocity dispersion is approximately 300  @xcite , equivalent to a single galaxy random velocity of about 200 .",
    "this velocity dispersion is generated in groups which suggests that an average @xmath20 will be about 0.3  at @xmath25 .",
    "the f - o - f algorithm provides a set of trial groups whose properties are fixed by the input link distance parameters such that many of them may not be virialized .",
    "virialized groups have a minimum overdensity of about @xmath26 .",
    "hence , for each trial group we estimate a velocity dispersion which is then used to calculate @xmath20 . galaxies beyond a distance to the group center of @xmath24 are discarded .",
    "the remaining galaxies are used to recalculate the velocity dispersion .",
    "this can be iterated until the group converges to a stable set .",
    "some trial groups quickly drop to only one or two members and hence no longer qualify for group status . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose a very large starting value of @xmath10 or @xmath11 a few groups will percolate over very large structures .",
    "a minor complication is that we must identify a group center .",
    "the details of our group finding algorithm follow .",
    "( 1 ) pick a cosmology for the analysis ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "( 2 ) set the sample s redshift and absolute luminosity limits ( k - corrected and evolution - compensated at a mean rate of one magnitude per unit redshift ) of @xmath28 mag , no initial redshift limits ) which defines a galaxy sample for all further operations .",
    "( 3 ) pick an @xmath10 ( our standard groups use 0.25 ) and @xmath12 ( 5  for our standard groups ) .",
    "center a cylinder of radius @xmath10 and forward and backward extent of @xmath12 on each sample galaxy and count the number of sample galaxies . to create a background estimate",
    "we randomly draw points from an @xmath16 fitted to the full sample and count the number within the sample cylinder .",
    "if the search radii initially give less than three neighbors , then multiply smoothing lengths by 1.5 and repeat for this sample galaxy . at this stage a new subsample is defined requiring that the local overdensity relative to the smooth sample have some specified minimum value . in this paper",
    "we only impose the requirement that the local overdensity be positive .",
    "( 4 ) select the highest density ungrouped galaxy and begin to find a new group . ( 5 ) standing on each new group member in turn , add to the group any galaxy in the minimum overdensity subsample that is closer than @xmath10 and @xmath12 . repeat this step until no new galaxies are added .

    "7 ) for the trial virialized group , determine the geometric selection function weighted mean @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath22 .",
    "trim galaxies beyond , or add galaxies from the f - o - f list within , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "repeat step 7 four more times , requiring that the last two iterations have an identical result .",
    "( 8) drop single galaxies and pairs from the catalogue .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) was undertaken primarily to study the dynamics of galaxy clustering at intermediate redshift .",
    "the survey methods and catalogues are fully described in yee  ( 2000 ) .",
    "the survey covers a total of about 1.5 square degrees in four patches spread around the sky for observing efficiency and to control cosmic variance .",
    "galaxy redshifts are obtained over the redshift range 0 to 0.7 , with the unbiased spectroscopic sample extending between redshifts 0.1 and 0.55 .",
    "the catalogues contain approximately 6000 galaxy redshifts with an accuracy between 70 and 100 , along with ubvri photometry .",
    "the groups are constructed from these catalogued galaxies .",
    "the luminosity and clustering evolution of the sample as a whole has been previously discussed @xcite .",
    "the cnoc2 sample has @xmath34 mag and well defined spectroscopic completeness weights .",
    "the average redshift completeness is about 45% , with nearly 100% completeness 3 magnitudes above the limit and about 20% at the limit . within our primary redshift range , 0.10 to 0.55 , the redshift completeness to the flux limit is higher than for the sample as a whole . from our luminosity functions @xcite",
    "we calculate the probability that we will successfully obtain a redshift as about 75% with the other 25% being for galaxies at redshifts out of our primary redshift range @xcite . together",
    "these imply that about 60% of the galaxies above the flux limit in the redshift range 0.1 to 0.55 have measured redshifts .",
    "if a group contains 3 galaxies within the survey limits , then the probability from the cumulative binomial distribution that we will obtain 3 redshifts is @xmath35 or 0.216 .",
    "if the group contains 4 eligible galaxies then the probability we will obtain 3 or more redshifts rises to 0.47 .",
    "the probabilities of obtaining 3 or more redshifts in groups of 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 eligible members are 0.68 , 0.81 , 0.90 and 0.95 , respectively , assuming no complications from geometric selection @xcite .",
    "our average group contains 3.8 galaxies with redshifts .",
    "we conclude that our roughly one - in - two sampling allows us to detect about half of the three or more members groups that are present .",
    "this level of completeness has no bearing on most of our analysis so we normally do not attempt to compensate for this effect .",
    "there is a small effect due to groups at the boundaries of the surveyed region . examining a typical field we find that no more than 20% of the groups have any of their @xmath20 area beyond the boundary and no more than half of that .",
    "consequently approximately 10% of the group members are `` missing '' , which will have little effect on the velocity dispersions , and cause roughly a 10% diminution of the group masses , through the virial radius , and a similar effect on the total light . in the presence of much larger random fluctuations due to the small numbers in the groups",
    "this is not a major concern .",
    "the only two parameters that turn out to have much of an impact on the groups are @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "our density requirement forces the `` raw '' groups to have a velocity dispersion strongly correlated with the search distance in the redshift direction , @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the iteration on the group velocity dispersion is shown in figure  [ fig : sig12 ] .",
    "the initial velocity dispersion is calculated for the f - o - f groups and is hence very strongly correlated with the chosen @xmath12 .",
    "the iteration to find virialized groups allows the @xmath22 values to relax to more appropriate values .",
    "however some less than ideal groups do persist which will lead us to continually consider alternate samples throughout this paper .",
    "most of the groups converge to a stable membership in one or two iterations , with only 1 - 2% discarded due to failure to converge in four iterations .",
    "figure  [ fig : nz ] shows the redshift distribution of the groups for four group catalogues with increasing @xmath12 . beyond redshift 0.45 the sample becomes incomplete as the flux limit of @xmath36 mag causes galaxies to slip below the sample absolute magnitude limit @xmath28 mag . both this figure and",
    "a detailed examination of the lists of groups shows that the sets of groups have a large overlap , independent of the search parameters .",
    "that is , this indirectly indicates that the set of group centers is relatively insensitive to the group finding procedure . in the next section",
    "we examine a variety of statistics to form a basis to select some group catalogues as best suited to various analyses .",
    "we will use three global properties of the groups to assess the degree of correspondence of various group catalogues to dark halos .",
    "these are the mass - to - light ratio distribution , the abundance as a function of velocity dispersion and the clustering properties .",
    "the virial mass to r band light ratio , @xmath37 , of groups is an indicator of the value of @xmath38 .",
    "the number density of dark matter halos as a function of their one - dimensional rms velocity dispersion , @xmath39 , is an important test of the cdm clustering spectrum but here is used as a guide to whether the number of high velocity dispersion groups is reasonable .",
    "the group - group auto - correlation as a function of mean separation , @xmath40 , is a test of clustering theory .",
    "together these indicators provide valuable information as to whether galaxy groups have approximately the properties expected on the basis that the galaxies are orbiting in a dark - matter dominated potential that is at least partially virialized .",
    "our statistical goals for group selection are to maximize the number of real groups and minimize the number of groups which contain redshift space interlopers .",
    "the derived group attributes come in three categories , with increasing sensitivity to the search parameters .",
    "first is the group centers , @xmath41 and @xmath31 ; second are the group extensions in @xmath42 , and velocity , and third there are the specific galaxies in the groups . for all purposes the locations are key , whereas the extensions are secondary .",
    "the extensions do enter scaling relations , and the precise group membership is not relevant for averaged , background subtracted measurements .      the ratio of the virial mass to the total luminosity , @xmath43 , is a valuable indicator of the cdm mass density of the universe . it does not measure any component of the mass that clusters weakly .",
    "the virial mass - to - light ratio of groups has quite considerable scatter simply as a result of both small number statistics and orbital projection . on the basis of dynamical simulations heisler , tremaine & bahcall ( 1985 )",
    "found the dispersion in virial mass estimates as a result of these fluctuations is nearly a factor of two above and below the true mass , but this was comparable to other mass estimators .",
    "we calculate the virial mass , @xmath44 , using the galaxies in the groups with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , following the cnoc methods @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath47 where the virial radius is evaluated for the galaxies identified as being group members .",
    "the circularly averaged harmonic radius is @xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in legendre s notation @xcite .",
    "the softening , @xmath51 arcsecond , eliminates the divergence for galaxies at the same radii from the group center @xcite .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath43 , is k - corrected , evolution compensated , and includes an extrapolation of the luminosity function to allow for galaxies below the redshift dependent absolute magnitude cutoff . the evolution is taken to be at a mean rate of one magnitude per unit redshift .",
    "if group galaxies are drawn from a universal luminosity function and the ratio of dark mass to luminous mass is a constant then the median @xmath52 should be constant .",
    "the spread of the distribution of values can be used as an indicator of the statistical reliability of the group selection procedure . in figure",
    "[ fig : mls ] we plot the median @xmath52 against the fractional difference between the first and third quartile @xmath52 values . in the same system clusters",
    "have @xmath53 @xcite , where we have removed the cnoc1 correction for the mean flattening of clusters . the median @xmath52 increases with both @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "groups selected with @xmath54 and large @xmath12 have huge median @xmath3 values and a large spread between first and third quartile values .",
    "smaller @xmath12 lead to an increase in the spread and decrease in the mean @xmath52 .",
    "the origin of this decrease in @xmath52 with size is at least partially a result of the internal @xmath3 gradient within groups that we discuss below .",
    "overall , the @xmath55 groups with @xmath56 have the desirable property that both the spread and the median of the distribution do not change too much with @xmath12 .",
    "the derived properties of the groups have very substantial uncertainties because of the small number of galaxies with velocities .",
    "the errors in the velocity dispersion and the resulting correlation with the derived virial mass - to - light ratios are illustrated in figure  [ fig : ml_sig ] for the @xmath55 and @xmath57 groups .",
    "the large errors are the dominant source of the very strong correlation between the velocity dispersion and the derived @xmath3 , as a consequence of @xmath44 as @xmath58 , which accurately predicts the slope of the correlation visible in the figure .",
    "the inset diagram restricts the sample to groups with at least six members . in this case",
    "there is some support for the indication that the the mass - to - light ratio rises with velocity dispersion .",
    "the number of groups as a function of their line - of - sight rms velocity dispersion is given in figure  [ fig : lnsig ] for a range of group search parameters .",
    "the median velocity dispersions for @xmath55 are 192 , 229 , 256 and 266 for @xmath59 of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "below 100  is the regime of individual galaxies , which reduces the number of groups .",
    "a small effect is that the velocity precision of the survey is about 100 , which artificially reduces the numbers of low velocity dispersion groups . at this stage",
    "we recall that large values of the search length in the redshift direction tends to include enough outlier galaxies that a few groups are promoted into the high @xmath22 tail of the distribution .",
    "given that high velocity dispersion groups also tend to contain the most galaxies ( for a constant @xmath3 ) , large groups are the easiest to find .",
    "thus low membership groups with high velocity dispersions are likely to have erroneously large @xmath22 values .    the press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory works well to describe the abundance of halos in n - body experiments and a range of observational data , including clusters over a range of redshifts @xcite and low redshift groups @xcite",
    ". we can compare the press - schechter prediction for the number of groups to our observations . because this requires absolute numbers we will use the redshift range of greatest completeness , roughly 0.2 to 0.45 .    to calculate the expected density",

    "note that the normalization we have used automatically means that our group number densities will match on to the cnoc1 clusters @xcite .",
    "the press - schechter predictions of number density for a median redshift of 0.36 are displayed in figure  [ fig : lnsig ] .",
    "the subsample is contained in a volume of @xmath70 ( or about 50% more for a flat cosmology ) .",
    "below 100  the sample is missing many halos for two reasons .",
    "first , individual galaxy halos make up the majority of the halos in this regime .",
    "the velocity dispersion of an @xmath71 elliptical is about equal to that of our median group ( which in itself suggests an evolutionary connection ) .",
    "second , because our velocity accuracy is about 100  low velocity halos are scattered into the next higher bin . at this stage",
    "it we recall that our expected completeness rate for higher velocity dispersion groups is about 50% and even lower for those with velocity dispersions comparable to individual galaxies .",
    "the press - schechter predictions are in reasonable agreement with the groups for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , bearing in mind that the random errors are at least @xmath74 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath12 miss high @xmath22 groups , while larger values , @xmath75 , produce a few highly improbable groups with the velocity dispersions of rich clusters .",
    "there are three reasons to select the @xmath55 and @xmath57 groups as the best suited to our analysis of virialized halos with velocity dispersions of approximately 100 - 300 , although other group selections parameters give rise to samples that show a very similar set of @xmath76 locations .",
    "the selected groups have a relatively low dispersion in their @xmath3 values , their @xmath39 distribution is close to the press - schechter prediction with few high velocity outliers , and the dynamical analysis below finds that our chosen redshift distance inclusion length pulls in most of the group members so that the derived velocity dispersions are fairly stable against the addition of more outlying members with increasing cutoff velocity .    the locations on the sky of the `` standard '' @xmath57 and @xmath55 groups for one of the patches are shown as the points in figure  [ fig : xy ] .",

    "the random errors of the derived quantities , as estimated using the jackknife technique , are very large for most of the groups , a straightforward consequence of the small numbers of members .",

    "the situation for galaxy mass halos is somewhat controversial , with constraining data coming from disk rotation curves in the presence of substantial amounts of baryonic mass and the modeling complication of partial pressure support relative to the circular velocity .",
    "however there is evidence that in small velocity dispersion halos cdm may allow central densities that exceed the observations @xcite .",
    "a fundamental difference between a galaxy and a rich cluster of galaxies is that galaxies have a strongly rising mass - to - light ratios with increasing distance from the center whereas rich galaxy clusters have a nearly constant mass - to - light ratio over their virialized volume @xcite .",
    "therefore a basic question is whether groups exhibit a rising mass - to - light ratio .",
    "individual groups have too few galaxies to make such a measurement .",
    "moreover groups come with a wide range of galaxy contents and have somewhat uncertain virialization because of their small numbers .",
    "therefore we assemble a `` stacked '' mean group to boost the numbers to levels where we can make reliable measurements of the density and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "precisely how the mean group is built from the individual groups will have a significant impact on its properties .",
    "for instance , poorly determined centers will create a core in the projected profile , or , overlaying a small low velocity dispersion group with a large high velocity dispersion group will lead to a rising velocity dispersion with radius .",
    "the idea is simple : we stack galaxies in both @xmath42 and @xmath14 on the group centers keeping track of the expected number of background galaxies .",
    "all galaxies are used , with no distinction given to galaxies that were used to define the group center .",
    "the group centers are determined in the virial analysis as the geometric weighted mean of the locations of the iteratively selected group members .",
    "we have adopted geometric weights , which help to compensate for the objects without redshifts .",
    "the smoothing radius used to calculate our geometric weights is 120  which is so large that there is little weight variation within these small groups , but weights do vary from group to group .",
    "that is , at the @xmath104 location of each of the @xmath105 groups in turn , we count the number of galaxies in the neighborhood at separations @xmath106 and @xmath107 , to measure the stacked density distribution in redshift space of a group , @xmath108 . the stacked density distribution is related to the two - dimensional group - galaxy correlation function , @xmath109 as , @xmath110 , \\label{eq : xigg}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is a smoothed fit to the redshift distribution locally converted to velocities in precisely the same way as the real galaxy pairs .",
    "this is the @xmath86 method @xcite of calculating a cross - correlation between groups and galaxies .",
    "the correlation function @xmath109 is the fundamental quantity of interest , since it has the background density removed .",
    "both the surface density profile and the velocity dispersion profile are derived from @xmath109 .",
    "note that the total luminosity of the group uses the magnitude weights , which allows for the declining sampling rate towards the sample limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : xy ] builds the confidence that the selected centers are entirely sensible , although at this stage we can not claim that this is an optimal procedure .    to assemble our `` standard '' mean group",
    "we will scale all the velocities to the @xmath22 measured for each group and the radii to the @xmath20 derived from the velocity dispersion . because there is a substantial uncertainty in @xmath22 for these small groups",
    "there is a concern that these scalings contain a large random element . at some level",
    "this is unavoidable . as the galaxies orbit in the groups they will have different velocities and positions with time which because of the little averaging available in small groups leads to considerable variation of their redshift space properties . scaling the velocities and the radii avoids the pitfall of overlaying small , low velocity dispersion groups on the inside and large , high velocity dispersion groups on the outside , which would immediately lead to a rise of velocity dispersion with radius .",
    "the plot of the radial location of each galaxy that contributes to the mean group as a function of the source group s velocity dispersion in figure  [ fig : rr200 ] does show one potential systematic problem : the higher velocity dispersion groups do not extend out to @xmath112 .",
    "this suggests that redshift space interlopers are an important source of noise leading to velocity dispersions that are too large for the size of the group . to address this issue",
    "we will be considering a number of alternate groups samples to check our results .",
    "although these groups have small numbers of members interlopers can be accurately removed statistically .",
    "we use the smoothed @xmath111 that we derive from the galaxy sample as a whole using the procedures of our clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "the random data are scaled in precisely the same way at the true data to determine whether or not they are in the cluster . to do the subtraction we need to bin the mean group in @xmath42 and @xmath14 bins .",
    "we select bins that are 0.2 dex in log@xmath113 and 0.1 in the velocities scaled to @xmath22 .",
    "the binning is needed in our subsequent analysis anyway .",
    "we make velocity distance cuts at 3 , 4 and 5 units as a check on the effect of residual interlopers and normally use the minimal noise 3 unit cut as our standard dataset .",
    "although we have statistically subtracted the background , the velocity dispersion estimate is very sensitive to the presence of field interlopers .",
    "in physical co - ordinates the densities of the groups are expected to be about @xmath114 near @xmath20 , but this is reduced by a factor of roughly @xmath115\\simeq 20 $ ] at our @xmath116 cutoff .",
    "consequently interlopers , which are distributed nearly uniformly in distance , generally cause erroneously large velocity dispersions . if there is a constant density normalization underestimate then the fraction of interlopers will increase with @xmath42 , since the contrast between the group and the surrounding field declines with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of group interlopers can be estimated from the two - point correlation function .",
    "the probability that a galaxy with @xmath117 and @xmath118 is physically within @xmath119 is discussed in carlberg  ( 2000a ) .",
    "the conclusion is that slightly more than 50% of the galaxies within the required velocity separation are within the required radial separation , @xmath120 .",
    "the other 50% are clustered towards the group but most probably at roughly a correlation length .",
    "other than small factors of order unity this redshift to real space ambiguity always exists .",
    "this means groups of size @xmath121 may well be of size @xmath122 .",
    "the chances that they are of size @xmath123 drops precipitously .",
    "of course as @xmath121 rises the fraction of interlopers is falling .",
    "these correlated but unvirialized group galaxies can not be avoided .",
    "although they present a challenge for a particular group they are not a significant complication for most statistical analyses of the mean group , given the mean group density profile we derive below .",
    "summing the mean group over velocities gives the mean projected density profile displayed in figure  [ fig : osurf ] .",
    "the points are for cutoffs at 3 , 4 and 5 velocity units , with the points declining slightly at small radii for increasing velocity cutoffs as a result of the normalization of the total integrated density to unity .",
    "the errors are evaluated from the patch - to - patch variance .",
    "there is little systematic change with increasing velocity cutoff .",
    "it is immediately clear that the projected density profile is very nearly a power law with only a weak break to a slightly shallower central profile .",
    "the mean projected slope of our virialized groups is approximately @xmath124 .",
    "the effect of restricting the sample to the @xmath125 groups is shown in the inset to figure  [ fig : osurf ] .",
    "the density profile becomes somewhat steeper at large radii and there is a suggestion there is a break in the power law at small radii .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , although the core slope is not well defined .    we model the projected galaxy density distribution as the projection of the galaxy number density distribution , @xmath128 which is projected to a surface density using @xmath129 so that we minimize the variance in the @xmath130 plane .",
    "the resulting best fit is degenerate because the scale radius is always found to be very small .",
    "for the data displayed we find @xmath131 and @xmath132 , for cutoffs of 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath133 $ ] pairs are @xmath134 $ ] , @xmath135 $ ] , and @xmath136 $ ] , respectively .",
    "however , other fits with @xmath137 are equally acceptable given the small implied scale radius , @xmath138 .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that using our mean group center we identify such a cusped density profile .",
    "the procedure is not guaranteed to have any galaxy at the center of the group , whereas we find that on the average the galaxy density declines quite steeply away from the center .",
    "this is quite different from the cluster situation where a similar average center gives a reduced central density @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile does not provide a good fit to this distribution of galaxies , although it must be borne in mind that the nfw model describes the dark matter profile , not the galaxy distribution which can in principle be quite different .",
    "our observed group profile is near a power law which is steeper in the center and shallower at large radii , than the nfw function or the steeper central cusps found by others @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile allows the mass profile to be constrained .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion profile , @xmath139 , for the @xmath57 groups is shown in figure  [ fig : osig ] .",
    "it is crucial that the weak rise , or at least absence of of a decline , in the projected velocity dispersion with radius be real , not an artifact of inadequate background subtraction .",
    "we display the results for several alternate values of @xmath12 in figure  [ fig : osig_rz ] , and find that all give similar velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : osig_rz ] also shows that setting @xmath12 larger than the standard tends to increase the noise , while smaller values tend to leave out genuine group galaxies in the @xmath22 estimate so that larger velocity cutoffs quickly lead to higher @xmath139 .    to help understand the distribution of possible outliers we present figure  [ fig : gray ] , a gray scale of the @xmath140 plane of the mean group profile , normalized to @xmath141 , to remove the surface density variation .",
    "the plot shows that inside of about @xmath142 the statistics are too poor to give useful results . beyond about @xmath143",
    "there is no expectation that the galaxies are in virial equilibrium .",
    "the figure provides evidence that the slow rise in velocity dispersion across the virialized region is real and not a consequence of increasing interlopers with radius .",
    "beyond about @xmath143 virialized motions are small and the width of the distribution increases rapidly .",
    "the slow rise of @xmath139 is clearly rooted in the data , although a constant @xmath144 is not strongly excluded .",
    "it is well known that the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies has a similar weak rise with increasing separation ; however that is expected on the basis of the two - point correlation function falling as @xmath145 , rather than the @xmath2 that we find here . a dynamical constraint from the jeans equation",
    "is that in a scale free distribution , @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the surprising outcome is the combination of the `` steep '' @xmath147 and `` slowly - rising '' @xmath139 .",
    "interlopers are always a concern but will tend to increase the outer values of both these functions , to leave the discrepancy in place .    to evaluate the significance of the radial trends we require reliable errors estimates .",
    "the errors in @xmath147 and @xmath139 are robustly and empirically evaluated from the patch - to - patch variances in the quantities of interest .",
    "we find that the sensitivity to the velocity cutoff is relatively small , except that the errors increase in size . as a consequence we will use the 3 velocity unit cutoff as our standard .",
    "the velocity dispersion is calculated as the second moment of the binned projected velocity distribution function ( pvdf ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vdf ] displays the average pvdf , normalized to the velocity dispersion in each radial bin .",
    "we note that the observed pvdf is much closer to gaussian than to an exponential , although relative to the gaussian the group mean pvdf appears to have a small excess at small and large velocities .",
    "this pvdf indicates that only mild anisotropy is allowed @xcite , at least for simple distribution functions .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion is easily modeled as the projection of a 3d velocity dispersion , where we adjust the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath148 , and the velocity anisotropy , @xmath149 , to fit the data .",
    "the projection integral is , @xmath150 n - body models suggest that the orbits of galaxies should be similar to that of the full dark matter distribution , with some deficiency of radial orbits which are selectively removed due to merging and tidal destruction @xcite . in principle , the velocity ellipsoid is constrained by the pvdf , shown in figure  [ fig : vdf ] .",
    "we model the radial velocity dispersion as @xmath151 which is a solution of jeans equation which worked well for clusters @xcite . in the absence of other information ,",
    "the velocity anisotropy , @xmath152 , is best taken to be a constant independent of radius .",
    "however , that choice immediately leads to the somewhat surprising result that the mass - to - light ratio rises with radius . in order to investigate the sensitivity of the result to the velocity anisotropy we adopt the model , @xmath153 , \\label{eq : varbeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath154",
    "this @xmath149 function goes to @xmath155 at the origin and @xmath156 at large radius . as reasonable alternatives we set @xmath157 or @xmath158",
    "this parameter could in principle be part of the nonlinear fit , but because dynamical problems are under - constrained without some knowledge of the velocity anisotropy we choose to use values of this parameter where our @xmath149 gives a useful variation over the range of the data .",
    "the fits are shown for the three different velocity cutoffs in figure  [ fig : osig ] .",
    "note that the results for different @xmath159 are essentially indistinguishable , and that the model has little difficulty giving a statistically acceptable fit to the data .",
    "the dynamical mass profile can be derived from the tracer density profile , @xmath160 , its velocity dispersion , @xmath148 , and the velocity anisotropy , @xmath149 , using jeans equation , @xmath161 .",
    "\\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] the validity of this equation does not rely on @xmath160 being distributed like the mass density , @xmath162 .",
    "it does require that the system be in dynamical equilibrium , which our group selection procedures are specifically designed to pick out . throughout we will use @xmath163 as the luminosity profile , assuming galaxies have the same mean luminosities at all radii .",
    "strictly speaking we are working out the mass - to - number ratio .",
    "the assumption that low and high luminosity galaxies are similarly distributed relative to the mass field is explicitly tested below .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it weights the galaxies relatively equally , rather than concentrating most of the statistical weight on the high luminosity galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mol ] we display the @xmath164 profile for the standard group centers with the velocity dispersion calculation cutoff set at three velocity units .",
    "note that this shows the integrated interior @xmath3 , not the local values .",
    "we first model these standard groups using a conventional approach with minimal anisotropy . that is , the central velocity ellipsoid is isotropic ,  @xmath165 , the anisotropy radius , @xmath166 , is at about the midpoint of the virialized region , @xmath167 .",
    "the outer anisotropy , @xmath156 , takes on the values @xmath168 and @xmath169 , which range from nearly tangential to slightly radial velocity anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath3 curves are normalized to unity at the data point closest to @xmath170 .",
    "the data indicate about a factor of three to ten rise in the mass - to - light per decade of radius , with little sensitivity to the outer velocity anisotropy .",
    "that is , the light is much more centrally concentrated than the mass .",
    "this effect is visible for many of the groups where their sky distribution is much more concentrated than their @xmath20 as shown in figure  [ fig : xy ] .",
    "the insets in figure  [ fig : mol ] address the concern about erroneously large @xmath22 values biasing the properties of the mean groups .",
    "the lower inset shows the results of the analysis based on the stacked groups restricted to have @xmath171 .",
    "the upper inset is the result of the analysis where we have overlaid all groups in physical co - ordinates . for convenience and comparability in this case",
    "we have taken @xmath172 for the scaling .",

    "overlaying groups in physical space serves to minimize the size of the rise .",
    "the differences between these results serves as an indication of the size of the systematic errors .",
    "the mass - density profile , @xmath162 , derived from the mass profile as @xmath173 , is plotted in figure  [ fig : den ] for the same models as in figure  [ fig : mol ] .",
    "the model with the most extreme velocity ellipsoid at large radii , the tangentially dominant @xmath174 ( solid line ) , implies a large core which becomes relatively smaller as @xmath156 becomes more positive .",
    "this model dependent result is one of the most interesting aspects of these groups and its reality needs to be tested which we can at least partially do within our own data .",
    "the upper and lower insets are for the @xmath175 sample and the physical co - ordinate stacking of the entire sample , respectively .    an alternate version of the groups , with @xmath72 , is analyzed in the same way as the @xmath57 groups with mass - to - light shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : omol ] and density in figure  [ fig : oden ] . in this case , an even steeper rise of mass - to - light emerges than for the standard groups .",
    "for velocity ellipsoids with @xmath176 the central mass density is negative .",
    "the effect of analyzing the standard groups with @xmath157 is shown in the upper right panels of figures  [ fig : omol ] and [ fig : oden ] .",
    "this small @xmath166 boosts the sensitivity of the gradient to @xmath156 .",
    "we conclude that the existence of a core in the dark matter distribution depends sensitively on the assumption that the velocity anisotropy is close to isotropic .",
    "a strong tangential anisotropy in the center , @xmath177 , is able to almost eliminate the mass - to - light gradient as shown in the lower panels of fig  [ fig : oden ] , with @xmath167 ( left ) and @xmath157 ( right ) .",
    "however we recall that the pvdf of figure  [ fig : vdf ] does not favor such strong anisotropy .",
    "the implied density , shown in the lower left panel of fig  [ fig : oden ] , is nearly a power law , @xmath178 , for @xmath174 , and none of these resemble the predicted dark matter density profiles @xcite .",
    "the source of the rising @xmath3 in the kinematic data is readily understood . in a power law density distribution with a radial density dependence of @xmath179 , the mass generating the potential must have a velocity dispersion profile of @xmath180 . from the velocity dispersion",
    "we measure that @xmath181 .",
    "this implies a mass density profile that is slightly shallower than @xmath178 .",
    "the measured mean light profile , @xmath182 , with @xmath183 .",
    "consequently the mass to light ratio , @xmath184 , which varies as @xmath185 , rises as @xmath186 .",
    "nearly circular orbits can flatten the @xmath3 profile for the observed velocities , but these @xmath159 would be very different than the observational results for rich galaxy clusters @xcite and n - body experiments @xcite .",
    "one significant difference between groups and rich clusters is that the timescale for dynamical friction to act declines as @xmath187 , so that dynamical friction is much more effective for galaxies orbiting in groups than clusters .      as a test of the galaxy population dependence of the result",
    ", we divide the group galaxies in to blue and a red subsamples , splitting at @xmath188 mag . in a second test",
    "we divide the group galaxy sample into high and low luminosity subsamples , splitting at @xmath189 mag .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 profiles , both masses and luminosity profiles calculated from these subsamples alone , are shown in figure  [ fig : omol_sub ] . to simplify the comparison we keep @xmath165 for all models , but continue to vary @xmath156 .",
    "the blue galaxies do a much better job of tracing the mass profile , that is , it is fairly flat , than the red galaxies do .",
    "the opposite is true in clusters @xcite . in both clusters and groups",
    "the red galaxies are more centrally concentrated than the blue galaxies .",
    "the @xmath3 gradient does not have a significant dependence on the luminosities of the galaxies .",
    "the latter is an argument that dynamical friction on a galaxy s gas and stars might not be the dominant source of the segregation of mass and light in groups .",
    "however , the presence of a much stronger @xmath3 gradient for the red galaxies would be consistent with dynamical friction taking several orbits after entry into the cluster to produce a segregation .",
    "in this paper we use the cnoc2 survey catalogues , containing approximately 6000 galaxies with redshifts , to identify more than 200 high probability virialized groups containing , on the average , 3.8 members with redshifts for a total of about 1000 group members .",
    "this represents about 25% of all eligible galaxies in the sample .",
    "these groups have selection dependent @xmath52 values comparable to the values of large clusters with the `` standard '' groups being about a factor of two lower . the group population volume density matches on to the number - velocity dispersion relation of clusters .",
    "the clustering of groups is enhanced at about the level expected for the approximately 200  velocity dispersion dark matter halos of groups as compared to the approximately 100  halos of individual galaxies .",
    "overall the global properties of groups are about as expected for dark matter halos on this mass scale .",
    "quite unlike rich clusters which have a mass - to - light profile constant with radius @xcite , our analysis of the internal properties of galaxy groups finds considerable evidence for a gently rising mass - to - light profile with radius .",
    "a second difference is that in groups the blue galaxies follow the dark mass more closely than the red galaxies .",
    "this paper presents several lines of argument that the rising velocity dispersion profile with radius is not an artifact of the analysis .",
    "moreover , the projected velocity distribution function indicates that the orbital distribution is unlikely to consist almost entirely of circular orbits , as would be required to minimize the rise in @xmath3 with radius .    the inference that @xmath3 rises with radius depends sensitively on the theoretical and indirect observational indication that the mean velocity ellipsoid is approximately isotropic .",
    "hence this result needs to be independently verified .",
    "current indirect support for this result comes from x - ray observations of low redshift galaxy groups having velocity dispersion overlap with our sample near 300 .",
    "the x - ray emission is significantly more extended than most of the group light indicating a rising @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "weak gravitational lensing is one of the best prospects to check this result since it has no dependence on assumptions of equilibrium .",
    "these intermediate redshift groups are ideally situated for weak lensing studies @xcite .",
    "the somewhat puzzling weak lensing results for the low velocity dispersion cluster ms1224 + 20 in two independent studies indicates that the @xmath3 is rising with radius @xcite .",
    "given the large group to group fluctuations it will be important to examine a statistically meaningful sample .    a highly model",
    "dependent result is that we find that the mean group most likely has a significant core radius . to retain",
    "a power law form would require very tangential orbits near the center .",
    "however , a large core could simply be a trivial result of the group galaxies sloshing around in the group potential , such that the centers of light and mass are not coincident . to further investigate the",
    "location and radial dependence of the central density profile of groups will require studying individual groups in detail , possibly with x - ray and weak lensing measurements .",
    "what is the origin of the rising @xmath3 ?",
    "the two physical possibilities are that galaxies sink with respect to the dark matter , or , that group dark matter has a small effective pressure which does not allow the core to undergo the same gravitational collapse as cold collisionless matter can .",
    "it is important to note that near @xmath20 both the galaxies and the dark matter have undergone about the same amount of collapse relative to the field .",
    "it is only in the inner third or so where the major differences develop , and the size of those differences is strongly dependent on the kinematic model .",
    "the simplest explanation is that these observations confirm the standard picture of a collisionless dark matter with gaseous dissipation allowing the baryonic matter to concentrate to the center of individual dark matter halos .",
    "as galaxies cluster together to form a group their individual halos are tidally removed to join the common halo from the outside in .",
    "dynamical friction from the collisionless dark matter causes the galaxies to sink in the common group halo , over about a hubble time @xcite .",
    "one possible concern with this interpretation is that when groups join together to make rich clusters this history needs to be erased to leave no measurable @xmath3 gradient . furthermore , whether this mechanism is consistent with no luminosity dependence of the @xmath3 gradient but a large galaxy color dependence of the @xmath3 gradient puts some fairly strong , but not necessarily unreasonable constraints , on the formation history of the galaxies .",
    "a more extreme possibility for the origin of the @xmath3 gradient is that the dark matter is subject to some effective pressure that does not allow it to undergo full gravitational collapse to form a core , either through a phase density limit , or through collisional interactions @xcite .",
