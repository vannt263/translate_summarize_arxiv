    "the study of equilibration and thermalization properties of complex many - body systems is of fundamental interest for many areas of physics and natural sciences  @xcite . for systems governed by classical physics ,",

    "tool for simulating quantum many - body systems at thermal equilibrium @xcite , can not be directly used to study time - dependent unitary dynamics .",
    "out - of - equilibrium properties are then often treated on the basis of approximations drastically simplifying the microscopic physics .",
    "irreversibility is either enforced with an explicit breaking of unitarity , e.g.  within the quantum boltzmann approach , or the dynamics is reduced to mean - field description using time - dependent hartree - fock and gross - pitaevskii approaches .",
    "although these approaches may qualitatively describe thermalization @xcite , their range of validity can not be assessed because genuine quantum correlations and entanglement are ignored .    for specific systems ,",
    "exact dynamical results can be derived .",
    "this is the case for integrable 1d models , for which bethe ansatz ( ba ) solutions exist @xcite .",
    "however , also in this case many open questions still persist .",
    "for example , the exact evaluation of correlation functions for out - of - equilibrium dynamics is at present an unsolved problem . as a result , despite important theoretical and experimental progress @xcite , a complete picture of thermalization ( or its absence ) , e.g. based on general quench protocols @xcite , is still missing .    numerical methods for strongly - interacting systems face important challenges as well .",
    "matrix product state ( mps ) approaches @xcite , which provide an essentially exact description of arbitrary 1d lattice systems in-  and out - of - equilibrium @xcite , have less predictive power when applied to continuos - space systems .",
    "continuous quantum field matrix product states ( c - mps ) @xcite , or approaches based on a multi - scale extension of the dmrg optimization scheme to the limit of continuous - space lattices @xcite are so far limited to relatively small system sizes @xcite or to sub - optimal variational states @xcite .",
    "moreover , the extension of these methods to higher dimensions , especially in the dynamical case , is at present , a fundamentally hard problem .",
    "another class of methods for strongly - interacting systems is based on variational monte carlo ( vmc ) , combining highly - entangled variational states with robust stochastic optimization schemes @xcite .",
    "such approaches have been successfully applied to the description of continuous quantum systems , in any dimension and not only in 1d  @xcite .",
    "more recently , out - of - equilibrium dynamics has become accessible with the extension of these methods to real - time unitary dynamics , within time - dependent variational monte carlo ( t - vmc ) @xcite .",
    "so far , the t - vmc approach has been developed for _ lattice _",
    "systems with bosonic @xcite , spin @xcite , and fermionic @xcite statistics , yielding a description of dynamical properties with an accuracy often comparable with mps - based approaches .    in this paper",
    ", we extend t - vmc to access dynamical properties of interacting quantum systems in continuous space .",
    "our approach is based on a systematic expansion of the wave function in terms of few - body jastrow correlation functions . using the 1d lieb - liniger model as a test case ,",
    "we first show that the inclusion of high - order correlations allows us to systematically approach the exact ba ground state energy , improving by orders of magnitude on existing vmc and c - mps results .",
    "we further compute single - body and pair correlation functions , hardly accessible by current ba methods .",
    "we then calculate the time evolution of the contact pair correlation function following a quench in the interaction strength . for the non - interacting initial state",
    ", we benchmark our results to exact ba calculations available for a small number of bosons and further compare to the quench action approach for large systems approaching the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we finally apply our method to the study of general quenches from arbitrary initial states , for which no exact results in the thermodynamic limit are currently available . whereas the non - equilibrium stationary state at large time is clearly non - thermal in the case of an ideal gas initial state , our results provide evidence for close - to - thermalization behavior in the more general case of an interacting , correlated initial state despite the integrability of the system .",
    "consider a non - relativistic quantum system of @xmath0 identical bosons in @xmath1 dimensions , and governed by the first - quantization hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , a one - body external potential and a pair - wise inter - particle interaction  . without loss of generality , a time - dependent @xmath0-body state can be written as @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the ensemble of particle positions and @xmath7 is a complex - valued function of the @xmath0-particle coordinates , @xmath8 .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) contains only two - body interactions , it is expected that an expansion of @xmath7 in terms of few - body jastrow functions containing at most @xmath9-body terms , rapidly converges towards the exact solution .",
    "truncating this expansion up to a certain order @xmath10 , leads to the bijl - dingle - jastrow - feenberg expansion @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are functions of @xmath9 particle coordinates , @xmath13 , and of the time @xmath14 .",
    "a global constraint on the function @xmath15 is given by particle statistics .",
    "in the bosonic case , we demand that @xmath16 , for all particle permutations @xmath17 . in general , the functions @xmath12 can have an arbitrarily complex dependence on the @xmath9 particle coordinates , which can prove problematic for practical applications .",
    "nonetheless , a simplified functional dependence can often be imposed , resulting from the two - body character of the interactions in the original hamiltonian . for @xmath18",
    ", @xmath12 can be conveniently factorized in terms of general two - particle vector and tensor functions following ref .",
    "details of this approach and the present implementation are presented in appendix  [ sec : functional - structure - of ] .",
    "an appealing property of the many - body expansion ( [ eq : jfe ] ) is that it is able to describe intrinsically non - local correlations in space .",
    "for instance the two - body @xmath19 , as well as any @xmath9-body function @xmath12 , can be long range in the particle separation @xmath20 .",
    "this non - local spatial structure allows for a correct description of gapless phases , where a two - body expansion may already capture all the universal features , in the sense of the renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the mps decomposition of the wave - function , which is intrinsically local in space .",
    "the time evolution of the variational state is entirely determined by the time - dependence of the jastrow functions @xmath12 . in order to establish optimal equations of motion for the variational parameters ,",
    "we start noticing that the functional derivative of @xmath21 with respect to the variational , complex - valued , jastrow functions @xmath12 , @xmath22 yields the @xmath9-body density operators @xmath23 the expectation values of the operators @xmath24 over the state @xmath25 give the instantaneous @xmath9-body correlations . for instance , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , is proportional to the two - point density - density correlation function .    we can then express the time derivative of the truncated variational state @xmath28 using the functional derivatives , eq .",
    "( [ eq : funcderu ] ) , as a sum of the few - body density operators up to the truncation @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 the exact wave - function satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the so - called _ local energy_. the optimal time evolution of the truncated bijl - dingle - jastrow - feenberg expansion  ( [ eq : jfe ] ) can be derived imposing the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variational principle @xcite .",
    "in geometrical terms , this amounts to minimizing the hilbert - space norm of the residuals @xmath33 , thus yielding a variational many - body state as close as possible to the exact one  .",
    "the minimization can be performed explicitly and yields a closed set of integro - differential equation for the jastrow functions @xmath12 : @xmath34 in practice , these equations are numerically solved for the time derivatives @xmath35 at each time step @xmath14 .",
    "the expectation values taken over the time - dependent state , @xmath36 , which enter eq .",
    ", are found via a stochastic sampling of the probability distribution @xmath37 .",
    "this is efficiently achieved by means of the metropolis - hastings algorithm , as per conventional monte carlo schemes ( see appendix  [ sec : monte - carlo - sampling ] for details ) .",
    "it then yields the full time evolution of the truncated bijl - dingle - jastrow - feenberg state  ( [ eq : jfe ] ) after time integration .",
    "the t - vmc approach as formulated here provides , in principle , an exact description of the real - time dynamics of the @xmath0-body system .",
    "the essential approximation lies however in the truncation of the bijl - dingle - jastrow - feenberg expansion to the @xmath29 most relevant terms . in practical applications ,",
    "the @xmath38 or @xmath39 truncation is often sufficient , and can be systematically improved by including more terms ( see below ) .",
    "as a first application of the continuous - space t - vmc approach , we consider the lieb - liniger model  @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "some exact results and numerical data are available , allowing us to benchmark the jastrow expansion and the t - vmc approach . on the other hand ,",
    "several aspects of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of this model are unknown , which we compute here for the first time using t - vmc .",
    "the lieb - liniger model describes @xmath0 interacting bosons in one dimension with contact interactions .",
    "it corresponds to the hamitonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the coupling constant . here",
    ", we consider periodic boundary conditions over a ring of length @xmath43 , and the particle density @xmath44 .",
    "the density dependence is as usual expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the lieb - liniger model is the prototypal model of continuous one - dimensional strongly - correlated gas exactly solvable by bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this model is experimentally realized in ultracold atomic gases strongly confined in one - dimensional optical traps , and several studies on out - of - equilibrium physics have been already realized  @xcite .    as a result of translation invariance , we have @xmath46 , and the first non - trivial term in the many - body expansion   is the two - body , translation invariant , function @xmath47 . to compute the functional derivatives of the many - body wave function , we proceed with a projection of the continuous jastrow fields @xmath12 onto a finite basis set . here",
    ", we have found convenient to represent both the field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and the jastrow functions , onto a uniform mesh of spacing @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 variational parameters for the @xmath50-body jastrow term . in the following our results",
    "are extrapolated to the continuous limit , corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "the finite - basis projection as well as the numerical time - integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) are detailed in the appendix [ sec : finite - basis - projection ] .      to assess the quality of truncated bijl - dingle - jastrow - feenberg expansions for the lieb - liniger model",
    ", we start our analysis considering ground - state properties .",
    "an exact solution can be found from the bethe ansatz ( ba ) and gives access to exact ground state energies and local properties @xcite .",
    "other non - local properties are substantially more difficult to extract from the ba solution , and unbiased results for ground state correlation functions have not been reported so far . in order to determine the best possible variational description of the ground - state within our many - body expansion , different strategies are possible .",
    "a first possibility is to consider the imaginary - time evolution @xmath52 which systematically converges to the exact ground - state in the limit @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gap with the first excited state on a finite system and provided that the trial state @xmath55 is non - orthogonal to the exact ground state .",
    "imaginary - time evolution in the variational subspace can be implemented considering the formal substitution @xmath56 in the t - vmc equations ( [ eq : eom ] ) .",
    "the resulting equations are equivalent to the stochastic reconfiguration approach @xcite",
    ". however , direct minimization of the variational energy can be significantly more efficient , in particular for systems becoming gapless in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath57 . given the gapless nature of the lieb - liniger model , we have found computationally more efficient to adopt a newton method to minimize the energy variance @xcite .    for the ground state ,",
    "the many - body expansion truncated at @xmath38 is exact not only in the non - interacting limit @xmath58 but also in the tonks - girardeau limit @xmath59 . in this fermionized",
    "limit the wave - function can be written as the modulus of a vandermonde determinant of plane waves , corresponding to the two - body jastrow function @xmath60 @xcite . to assess the overall quality of pair wave functions for ground state properties , we start comparing the variational ground - state energies @xmath61 obtained for @xmath38 with the exact ba result . in fig .  [ fig : gs - prop](a ) we show the relative error @xmath62 as a function of in the interaction strength @xmath63 .",
    "we find that the relative error is lower than @xmath64 for all values of @xmath63 and the accuracy of our two - body jastrow function is superior to previously reported variational results based either on c - mps or vmc [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : gs - prop](a ) for a quantitative comparison ] . notice that the improvement with respect to previous vmc results is due to the larger variational freedom of our @xmath65 function , which is not restricted to any specific functional form as done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even though the accuracy reached by the two - body jastrow function may already be sufficient for most practical purposes for all values of @xmath63 , we have also considered higher order terms with @xmath39 , shown in fig .",

    "the introduction of the third - order term yields a sizable improvement such that the maximum error is about three orders of magnitude smaller than existing c - mps results @xcite .",
    "our approach reaches an overall precision on a continuous - space system , which is comparable to state - of - the - art mps / dmrg results for gapless systems on a lattice @xcite .    finally , to further assess the quality of our ground state ansatz beyond the total energy , we have also studied non - local properties of the ground state wave function , which are not accessible by existing exact ba methods . in figs .",
    "[ fig : gs - prop](b ) and ( c ) we show , respectively , our results for the off - diagonal part of the one - body density matrix , @xmath66 , and for the pair correlation function , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the bosonic field operator .",
    "we find an overall excellent agreement with the results that have been obtained with c - mps at the largest bond dimension reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for some deviations at large values of @xmath69 which we attribute to residual finite - bond - dimension effects in the c - mps results .",
    "we found that the addition of the 3-body terms does not change significantly correlation functions .",
    "already at the 2-body level , the present results are indistinguishable from exact results obtained using our implementation @xcite of the worm algorithm @xcite and for the same system ( not shown ) .",
    "having assessed the quality of the ansatz for local and non - local ground - state properties , we now turn to the study of the out - of - equilibrium properties of the lieb - liniger model .",
    "we focus on the description of the unitary dynamics induced by a global quantum quench of the interaction strength , from an initial value @xmath70 to a final value @xmath71 .",
    "exact ba results are available only in the case of a non - interacting initial state ( @xmath72 ) . even in this case , the dynamical ba equations can be exactly solved only for a modest number of particles @xcite , @xmath73 , since the complexity of the ba solution increases exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "simplifications in the thermodynamic limit are exploited by the quench action @xcite , and have been recently applied to quantum quenches starting from a non - interacting initial state @xcite . in the following we first compare our t - vmc results to these existing results , and then present new results for quenches following a non - vanishing initial interaction strength .    to assess the quality of the time - dependent wave function we compare our results for the evolution of local density - density correlations , @xmath74 , with the truncated ba results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for a small number of particles , @xmath75 .",

    "these differences amount to a small increase in the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "this effect tends to increase with the interaction strength , being hardly visible for @xmath77 and more pronounced for @xmath78 .",
    "however , these oscillations result at large times from the discrete mode structure due to the very small number of particles .",
    "they vanish in the physical thermodynamic limit . in turn",
    ", the comparison at small particle numbers indicates an accuracy better than a few percent for time - averaged quantities in the asymptotic large time limit up to @xmath78 , with results at @xmath39 systematically improving on the @xmath38 case . concerning small and intermediate time scales ,",
    "we do not observe systematic deviations between the t - vmc results and the ba solution .",
    "in particular , the relaxation times are remarkably well captured by the t - vmc approach . on the basis of this comparison ,",
    "we conclude that t - vmc allows accurate quantitative studies of both the relaxation and equilibration dynamics .",
    "this careful benchmarking now allows us to confidently apply the t - vmc approach regimes that are inaccessible to exact ba namely large but finite @xmath0 and long times , as well as the case of non - vanishing initial interactions .",
    "let us consider relaxation of density correlations for a large number of particles , close to the thermodynamic limit ( here we use @xmath79 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn - ba - comp](b ) , we notice that the amplitudes of the large - time oscillations , attributed to the discrete mode spectrum , are now drastically suppressed compared to the quenches with @xmath80 .",
    "after an initial relaxation phase , the quantity @xmath74 approaches a stationary value . comparing our curves with those obtained with the quench action method , we find a qualitatively good agreement , albeit a general tendency to underestimate the quench action predictions is observed .",
    "we now turn to quenches from interacting initial states ( @xmath81 ) to different interacting final states for which no results have been obtained by means of exact ba nor simplified quench action method so far . in fig .",

    "is given by @xmath89 .",
    "the effective temperature , @xmath86 , is determined by imposing the energy expectation value of the final hamiltonian , @xmath85 , in the ground state , @xmath90 of the initial hamiltonian , @xmath91 . here",
    ", the thermal expectation value , @xmath92 at the equilibrium temperature @xmath86 is computed from the yang - yang ba equations @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 then depends on a single parameter @xmath86 , that is fitted to match the value of @xmath93 .    as shown in fig.[fig : dyn - ba - comp]-(b ) , thermalization certainly does not occur in the case for the lieb - liniger model when quenching from a non - interacting state , @xmath72 , where we find @xmath94 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the existence of dynamically conserved charges ( beyond energy and density conservation ) which can yield an equilibrium value substantially different from the boltzmann distribution .",
    "different approaches have been introduced to take into account these extra charges intrinsically present in integrable models @xcite .",
    "( a ) , and @xmath83 ( b ) , long - term dynamical averages ( red continuous lines ) are compared to thermal averages at the effective temperature set by energy conservation ( black dashed lines ) .",
    "[ fig : dyn - thermal ] ]    however , for a correlated initial ground state of @xmath81 , the difference between @xmath95 and @xmath96 is quantitatively reduced , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn - thermal ] . in particular , for @xmath83 ,",
    "the stationary values @xmath95 are quantitatively close to the ones predicted by the thermal distribution at the effective temperature @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , away from the super - integrable points @xmath72 and @xmath97 , the presence of conserved charges seems to affect less substantially the stationary state .",
    "our study thus indicates that a cross - over from a strongly non - thermal state to a close - to - thermal state might occur as a function of the initial interaction strength .",
    "this opens the way to new studies on thermalization in continuos - space integrable models .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a novel approach to the dynamics of strongly - correlated quantum systems in continuous space .",
    "our method is based on correlated many - body wave - function systematically expanded in terms of reduced @xmath9-body jastrow functions .",
    "the unitary dynamics in the subspace of these correlated states was realized using time - dependent variational monte carlo . we have demonstrated the accuracy of our method for the lieb - liniger model , for both static and dynamical properties .",
    "benchmarking t - vmc with exact or numerical approaches whenever available , we have found a very good agreement with existing results .",
    "for static properties , our approach is at the level of state - of - the - art mps techniques in lattice systems . for dynamical properties ,",
    "we have investigated for the first time general interaction quenches which are at the moment unaccessible to bethe - ansatz approaches .",
    "since the general structure of our t - vmc method does not depend on the dimensionality of the system , it can be directly applied to higher dimensions .",
    "this paves the way to accurate out - of - equilibrium dynamics of two-  and three - dimensional quantum gases and fluids beyond mean field approximations .",

    "however , the structure of these additional terms stemming from the local energy can be systematically used to deduce the functional structure of the higher order terms .",

    "the functional form of the three - body jastrow can be therefore deduced from this additional term and formed accordingly : @xmath105 with two - body functions @xmath106 containing new variational parameters to be determined . upon pursuing this approach ,",
    "the expansion can be systematically pushed to higher orders and the functional structure of the higher order functions inferred . the same constructive approach we have discussed here is also valid for the schrdinger equation in imaginary - time @xmath107 , and has been successfully used to infer the functional structure for ground - state properties @xcite .",

    "this is achieved by means of monte carlo sampling of the probability distribution @xmath110 ( in the following we omit explicit reference to the time @xmath14 , assuming that all expectation values are taken over the wave - function at a given fixed time ) .",
    "an efficient way of sampling the given probability distribution is to devise a markov chain of configurations @xmath111 which are distributed according to @xmath112 .",
