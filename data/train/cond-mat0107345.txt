    "the system is expected to collapse .",
    "this is called `` gravothermal catastrophe '' or `` antonov instability '' in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) and `` isothermal collapse '' in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) .",
    "dynamical models appropriate to star formation @xcite or globular clusters @xcite show that the collapse is self - similar and leads to a finite time singularity ( i.e. , the central density becomes infinite in a finite time ) .",
    "the value of the scaling exponent in the density profile @xmath7 depends whether the system evolves at fixed temperature ( in which case @xmath8 results from dimensional analysis ) or if its temperature is free to diverge ( in which case the value of the exponent is non trivial and often close to @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is found in general that the shrinking of the core is so rapid that the core mass goes to zero at the collapse time although the central density is infinite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a simple model of gravitational dynamics which exhibits similar features and which can be studied in great detail .",
    "specifically , we consider a gas of self - gravitating brownian particles enclosed within a spherical box . for simplicity",
    ", we take a high friction limit and reduce the problem to the study of the smoluchowski - poisson system . in the simplest formulation ,",
    "the temperature is constant ( canonical description ) .",
    "we also consider the case of an isolated medium with an infinitely large thermal conductivity so that its temperature is uniform in space but varies with time in order to conserve energy ( microcanonical description ) .",
    "the interest of these models is their relative simplicity which allows for a complete theoretical analysis , while keeping all the richness of the thermodynamical problem : inequivalence of statistical ensembles , phase transitions , gravitational collapse , finite time singularity , persistence of metastable states , basin of attraction ... these models are consistent with the first and second principles of thermodynamics and give a dynamical picture of what happens when no equilibrium state exists .",
    "however , in view of their considerable simplification , it is not clear whether these models can have astrophysical applications although connections with the dynamics of dust particles in the solar nebula and the process of `` violent relaxation '' in collisionless stellar systems are mentioned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_smoluchowski ] , we introduce the smoluchowski - poisson ( sp ) system for a gas of self - gravitating brownian particles and list its main properties . in particular , we make contact with thermodynamics and show that the sp system satisfies a form of @xmath10-theorem . in sec .",
    "[ sec_statmech ] , we discuss the existence of stationary solutions of the sp system and the relation with maximum entropy states . in sec .",
    "[ sec_stab ] , we perform a linear stability analysis of the sp system . we show that a stationary solution is linearly stable if and only if it is a local entropy maximum and that the eigenvalue problem for linear stability is connected to the eigenvalue problem for the second order variations of entropy studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec_selfsimilar ] , we consider the case of gravitational collapse and exhibit self - similar solutions of the sp system . since the particles are confined within a box , there is a small deviation to the purely self - similar regime and we describe this correction in detail .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_simulations ] , we perform various numerical simulations of the sp system for different initial conditions .",
    "we check the results of thermodynamics , namely the existence of equilibrium states for @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the gravitational collapse otherwise . we find that the collapse proceeds self - similarly with explosion , in a finite time @xmath13 , of the central density while the core radius shrinks to zero . in mce",
    "this is accompanied by a divergence of temperature and entropy . in the limit @xmath14 , we find the scaling laws @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the scaling exponent is @xmath8 in ce and @xmath17 in mce . in ce",
    ", the invariant profile @xmath18 can be determined analytically .",
    "the collapse time diverges like @xmath19 and @xmath20 as we approach the critical energy @xmath21 and critical temperature @xmath22 .",
    "we also study the linear development of the instability ( for unstable isothermal spheres ) and show that the density perturbation @xmath23 presents several oscillations depending on the value of the density contrast . in particular , at the points of marginal stability in the series of equilibria , the perturbation @xmath24 has a `` core - halo '' structure in the microcanonical ensemble but not in the canonical ensemble in agreement with theory @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of small particles with mass @xmath25 immersed in a fluid .",
    "we assume that the fluid imposes to the particles a friction force @xmath26 and a stochastic force @xmath27",
    ". this random force may mimic ordinary brownian motion ( i.e. the collisions of the fluid particles onto the solid particles ) or fluid turbulence .",
    "we assume in addition that the particles interact gravitationally with each other .",
    "therefore , the stochastic langevin equation describing the motion of a particle reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gravitational force acting on the particle . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that the stochastic force is delta - correlated in time and set @xmath30 where @xmath31 measures the noise strength of the langevin force . in order to recover the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath32 at equilibrium",
    ", the diffusion coefficient and the friction term must be related according to the einstein relation @xmath33 . applying standard methods @xcite ,",
    "we can immediately write down the fokker - planck equation associated with this stochastic process : @xmath34 this is the familiar kramers equation but , when self - gravity is taken into account , it must be coupled to the poisson equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this makes its study much more complicated than usual .",
    "the kramers - poisson ( kp ) system was first introduced in astrophysics by chandrasekhar @xcite in his stochastic theory of stellar dynamics ( for , e.g. , globular clusters ) . in that context , the diffusion and the friction arise self - consistently as the result of the fluctuations of the gravitational field .",
    "an equation of the form ( [ x4 ] ) was also proposed as an _ effective _ dynamics of collisionless stellar systems ( on a coarse - grained scale ) during the period of violent relaxation @xcite .    in order to simplify the problem , in a first approach",
    ", we consider a high friction limit @xmath37 .",
    "then , it is possible to neglect the inertial term in the langevin equation ( [ x0 ] ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equation describing this high friction limit is the smoluchowski equation @xmath38 with a diffusion coefficient @xmath39 and a drift term proportional to the gravitational force .",
    "the ordinary smoluchowski equation describes the sedimentation of colloidal suspensions in an external gravitational field .",
    "since it is a prototype of kinetic equations , it is clearly of great interest to consider the extension of this model to the case where the potential is not fixed but related to the density of the particles via a poisson equation , like in the gravitational case .",
    "the smoluchowski equation can be interpreted equivalently as a continuity equation for the density @xmath40 with a velocity field @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the pressure force and @xmath43 the gravitational force . at equilibrium ,",
    "the two terms balance each other and the boltzmann distribution ( [ fmb ] ) establishes itself .",
    "physically , the high friction limit supposes that there are two time scales in the problem . on a short time scale of the order of the friction time @xmath44 , the system thermalizes and the distribution function becomes maxwellian with temperature @xmath45 ( this is obvious if we take the limit @xmath46 in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ x4 ] ) ) .",
    "then , on a longer time scale of the order of the dynamical time @xmath47 , the particle distribution @xmath48 tends to evolve towards a state of mechanical equilibrium described by the boltzmann distribution ( [ fmb ] ) .",
    "note that the opposite assumptions are made for globular clusters @xcite : the system is assumed to be in mechanical equilibrium and the evolution is due to thermal transfers between the core and the halo .",
    "our model of self - gravitating brownian particles could find applications for the dynamics of dust particles in the solar nebula and the formation of planetesimals by gravitational instability ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in that context",
    ", the dust particles experience a friction with the gas modeled by stokes or epstein s laws and the high friction limit may be relevant . on the other hand , the diffusion of the particles could result from a stochastic component of the force or from fluid turbulence .",
    "this would be just a first approach because the physics of planetesimal formation is more involved than our simple model .    since the system described previously is in contact with a heat bath",
    ", the proper statistical treatment is the _ canonical ensemble _ in which the temperature @xmath45 is fixed . in order to test dynamically the inequivalence of statistical ensembles for self - gravitating systems",
    ", we would like to introduce a simple model corresponding to the _ microcanonical ensemble _",
    ", i.e. with strict conservation of energy @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , when a brownian particle moves with its terminal velocity in a gravitational field , the work of the force ought to be converted into heat .",
    "if the medium acts as a thermostat with an infinite volume and with rapid dissipation of heat , we can disregard the variation of temperature and we get the isothermal model discussed previously . however , if we are to keep track of local heating , the temperature will depend on space and time and we need to set up a model in which energy is conserved .",
    "such a generalization of brownian theory has recently been developed by streater @xcite in the case of an external gravitational potential .",
    "this _ statistical dynamics _",
    "approach @xcite leads to coupled nonlinear equations for the density @xmath48 and the temperature @xmath50 which are consistent with the first and second principles of thermodynamics .",
    "such equations can be derived from a microscopic model involving brownian particles and heat particles modeled as quantum oscillators .",
    "a generalization of these equations for self - gravitating brownian particles has been proposed by biler _",
    "it consists of the smoluchowski - poisson system ( [ x5 ] ) ( [ poisson ] ) coupled to a diffusion equation for the temperature @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the diffusion current in eq .",
    "( [ x5 ] ) .",
    "however , this model still remains complicated for a first approach . since our main purpose is to illustrate in the simplest way the basic features of the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems ( inequivalence of ensembles , gravothermal catastrophe , isothermal collapse , phase transitions , basin of attraction ... ) , we shall consider an additional approximation and let the thermal conductivity @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ streater ] ) go to @xmath54 .",
    "in that case , the temperature is uniform but still evolving with time according to the law of energy conservation ( first principle ) : @xmath55 the first term in the r.h.s is the kinetic energy @xmath56 for a maxwellian distribution function with temperature @xmath45 ( local thermodynamical equilibrium ) and the second term is the gravitational energy of interaction . equations ( [ x5 ] ) ( [ poisson ] ) ( [ ee2 ] ) lead to a simple microcanonical model for self - gravitating systems with a lot of attractive properties . the cauchy problem for this system of equations was studied by rosier @xcite .",
    "these equations were first proposed by chavanis _",
    "@xcite as a simplified model of `` violent relaxation '' by which a stellar system initially far from mechanical equilibrium tries to reach an isothermal state on a few dynamical times @xcite . in that context , the engine of the evolution is the competition between pressure and gravity , like in eq .",
    "( [ x5 ] ) .",
    "this particular equation corresponds to an overdamped evolution but more general equations taking into account inertial terms are also proposed in ref .",

    "the microcanonical ensemble is characterized by the specification of mass @xmath57 and energy @xmath49 .",
    "the thermodynamical potential is the entropy @xmath58 which is the form of the classical boltzmann entropy @xmath59 for a maxwellian distribution function with temperature @xmath45 .",

    "it can be noted that the kramers equation ( [ x4 ] ) and the smoluchowski equation ( [ x5 ] ) can also be derived from a variational formulation @xcite , called the maximum entropy production principle ( m.e.p.p . ) .",
    "this makes a direct relation between the dynamics and the thermodynamics .",
    "since the sp system with the constraint ( [ ee2 ] ) obeys the same conservation laws and h - theorem as more realistic models such as landau - poisson system @xcite and coarse - grained vlasov - poisson system @xcite , it should exhibit qualitatively similar properties even if the details of the evolution are expected to differ in many respects .    to properly define our system of equations",
    ", we must specify the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall assume that the system is non rotating and restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "in addition , we shall work in a spherical box of radius @xmath62 to avoid the well - known infinite mass problem associated with isothermal configurations .",
    "in that case , the boundary conditions are : @xmath63 the first condition expresses the fact that the gravitational force at the center of a spherically symmetric system is zero .",
    "the second condition defines the gauge constant in the gravitational potential .",
    "finally , the last condition insures that the total mass is conserved ( we have used the gauss theorem @xmath64 to simplify its expression ) .    for spherically symmetric systems ,",
    "it is possible to reduce the sp system to a single partial differential equation for the mass profile @xmath65 . multiplying both sides of eq .",

    "the difference with the usual virial theorem is the occurrence of a damping term @xmath78 due to friction . in the high friction limit",
    ", we get @xmath79 this expression can also be directly obtained from the sp system .",
    "the stationary solutions of the sp system are given by the boltzmann distribution ( [ fmb ] ) in which the gravitational potential appears explicitly .",

    "there is no equilibrium state above @xmath89 or @xmath90 . in that case , the system is expected to collapse indefinitely .",
    "it is also important to recall that the statistical ensembles are not interchangeable for systems with long - range interaction , like gravity . in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
