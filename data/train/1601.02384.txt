    "in the past decade the formation of protostellar discs in the earliest , embedded stage of protostellar evolution , the so - called class 0 stage @xcite , has been discussed extensively in literature from both the observational and numerical modelling side . from observations of the more evolved class i / ii stage",
    "protostars it is known that the fraction of discs in these later stages is well above 50 percent ( see e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which hints towards the existence of discs right from the onset of protostar formation .",
    "furthermore , the detection of protostellar outflows strongly indicates the presence of discs in the earliest stage of protostellar evolution @xcite .",
    "for this reason , an increasing effort has been made over the last years to directly identify the presence and dynamics of protostellar discs around class 0 objects , which resulted in the detection of several discs around low- and intermediate - mass protostars , which are possibly in keplerian rotating @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with previous observations based on sed modelling , which suggest the presence of well - defined , rotationally supported discs @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , @xcite as well as @xcite ( for a part of their observed objects ) do not find keplerian discs around class 0 objects .",
    "this raises the question what the actual fraction of ( rotationally supported ) discs in the class 0 stage is .",
    "a fraction well below 1 , i.e. not all young protostars have a protostellar disc , would imply a successive growth of centrifugally supported discs during the evolution towards the class i / ii phase ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    alternatively , if typical disc sizes are not larger than in diameter , the non - detection of discs could be a resolution issue .",
    "indeed , recent simulations of protostellar disc formation including turbulence and magnetic fields show that discs usually do not extend over more than about 100 au in size @xcite .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite showing that only in the presence of large - scale turbulent motions discs with radii larger than 10 au develop around low - mass protostars .",
    "furthermore , discs around class ii protostellar sources are in general also found to be not significantly larger than 100 au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that discs grow during their lifetime due to viscous spreading ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this puts some constraints on the disc size in the class 0 stage .",
    "hence , both numerical simulations and observations suggest that in typical protostellar cores including turbulent motions , disc sizes should be of the order of 10  100 au , which  at source distances of a few 100 pc  would require a resolution better than @xmath4 0.1  . with alma such highly resolved observations , which can reveal the dynamics of young protostellar discs in great detail , are now accessible .    in this work we present synthetic alma observations of self - consistent simulations of protostellar discs for various molecular line transitions and",
    "directly compare them with the simulation data .",
    "this allows us to study to what extent discs and keplerian rotation profiles can be detected around low- and intermediate - mass class 0 protostars and , if detected , how reliable the inferred disc parameters are .",
    "moreover , we will investigate which observational conditions like observing time , weather conditions , angular resolution , and molecular tracers are required to study protostellar discs with alma , in particular for the upcoming cycles , where the full capacity of alma will be available .",
    "main outcomes of this work are that with alma it will be possible to identify keplerian rotation for most of the lines considered , when adopting an observing time of 2  5 h per object , a resolution of 0.02  0.1  , and weather conditions corresponding to a precipitable water vapour of 0.5  1 mm .",
    "moreover , we show that protostellar masses inferred from pv diagrams are in general accurate within    the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : ic ] we briefly describe the 3d - magnetohydrodynamical simulations and their main outcomes",
    ". the radiative transfer simulations as well as the generation of the synthetic alma observations are described in section  [ sec : synobs ] . in section  [ sec : results ] we discuss the synthetic data obtained by assuming ideal observing conditions .",
    "we study whether keplerian rotation signatures can be identified , how reliable protostellar masses inferred from position - velocity diagrams are , and how the inclination angle influences the results . in section",
    "[ sec : conditions ] we investigate the influence of varying observing conditions , and give a guideline for future observations .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , before we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we carried out magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of the collapse of magnetized , turbulent , prestellar cores to follow the formation of protostellar discs . for this",
    "we use the adaptive - mesh refinement code flash @xcite in version 2 using a mhd solver developed by @xcite and @xcite with a maximum spatial resolution of 1.2 au . the poisson equation for gravity",
    "is solved with a barnes - hut tree code @xcite .",
    "in addition , we make use of the sink particle routine @xcite to model the formation of protostars . the simulations were discussed in detail in @xcite , which is why here we only briefly describe the basic setup of the simulations . for more details",
    "we refer the reader in particular to @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider two simulations , one with an initial core mass of 100 m@xmath5 and one with 2.6 m@xmath5 . throughout this work",
    "we refer to them as model 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the cores have a radius of 0.125 pc ( model 1 ) and 0.0485 pc ( model 2 ) . the density profile in model 1 declines as @xmath6 levelling off at 0.0125 pc , whereas that of model 2 corresponds to that of a bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "the initial temperature of the gas is 20 k and 15 k for model 1 and 2 , respectively , reflecting the somewhat lower temperatures typically observed in low - mass cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use a cooling function , which includes the effects of molecular cooling and dust cooling as well as a treatment for optically thick gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the cores are threaded by a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath7-axis with the strength chosen such that the ( normalised ) mass - to - flux ratio @xmath8 of the cores is 2.6 .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath8 is given in units of the critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant .    in all cores",
    "a turbulent velocity field is present with the turbulent mach number of 2.5 for the intermediate - mass model 1 and 0.74 for the low - mass model 2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally we note that for neither of the two models considered here an initial coherent rotation is present .",
    "we list all important parameters in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    ".overview of the initial parameters of model 1 and 2 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in a second step , we investigate the influence of the resolution using the same lines as in the previous section .",
    "however , we now use a five times coarser resolution of 0.1  , and an observing time of 2 h and a pwv of 1 mm . with this resolution , which corresponds to 15 au at an assumed distance of 150 pc ,",
    "the integrated emission coming from the discs ( not shown ) is almost circular without any clear elongation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] we show the corresponding pv diagrams for both models in the edge - on case for @xmath0co @xmath11 = 21 and hco@xmath2 @xmath11 = 32 . with the degraded resolution , keplerian rotation profiles can still be seen for both models , although model 2 is more noisy .",
    "we list the fitted protostellar masses in the right part of table  [ tab : fitsbadincl ] ) . ] and plot the corresponding keplerian rotation curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : res ] . in general , we find the protostellar masses to be somewhat too high , although the difference is in general not more than @xmath4 50% .",
    "we note that for an inclination of 30@xmath12 only hints of a keplerian profile for model 1 can be found whereas for model 2 no conclusions can be made about the dynamical state of the disc .    finally , we investigate what happens if the disc of model 1 is located at a distance of 1 kpc , which corresponds to typical distances of intermediate- to high - mass star forming regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] we show the synthetic alma observations of @xmath0co @xmath11 = 21 and hco@xmath13 assuming optimal observing conditions ( a pwv of 0.5 mm and an observing time of 5 h ) .    co @xmath11 = 21 ( left ) and hco@xmath13 @xmath11 = 32 ( right ) in model 1 assuming a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the red lines show the keplerian rotation curve for a central mass of 15.3 m@xmath5 inferred from the simulation . ]",
    "the integrated emission ( top row ) does not reveal a clear elongated structure typical for discs .",
    "however , in the pv diagram ( bottom row ) a keplerian rotation profile is clearly recognisable . plotting the keplerian rotation curve corresponding to a central mass of 15.3 m@xmath5 inferred from the simulation ( red lines ) , shows that it fits the observed pv diagram quite well .",
    "this indicates that with alma it should be possible to estimate protostellar masses even at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "we note that fitting the `` upper '' edge results in protostellar masses around 7 m@xmath5 , which we attribute to the more noisy background in the pv diagrams .    moreover ,",
    "the results for inclination angles of 60@xmath12 and 30@xmath12 show that keplerian profiles can be identified for both lines and angles considered , although for 30@xmath12 the identification is somewhat more difficult .",
    "the results thus clearly demonstrate the ability of alma to probe the dynamics of even strongly inclined discs at source distance typical for intermediate- to high - mass star forming regions .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] we summarize the results of this section .",
    "we show observing conditions on the @xmath14-axis and the inclination angle on the @xmath15-axis .",
    "the arrows indicate whether discs in keplerian rotation can be identified from the observations .        in general , alma should be able to detect discs and to identify keplerian rotation for moderately inclined disc ( 90@xmath12 and 60@xmath12 ) at a source distance of 150 pc even in the case of moderate weather conditions ( 1 mm pwv ) , an observing time of 2 h , and a resolution of 0.1  .",
    "for strongly inclined discs ( 30@xmath12 ) the identification of keplerian rotation signatures is more problematic in particular for discs around low - mass protostars .",
    "moreover , our results show that , when using the full capacity of alma , the dynamics of discs can be probed down to scales of @xmath4 100 au even at kpc distances .",
    "in section  [ sec : results ] , we show that the diameter of the disc in model 2 as extracted from the integrated emission maps ( fig .  [",
    "fig : intensity2 ] ) and the part of the pv diagram that is well fit by a keplerian profile ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_diag ] ) is well below 50 au .",
    "however , we know that the simulated disc is actually much larger , i.e. the radius of the disc with keplerian rotation is @xmath4 100 au ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : simulation ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "therefore the simulated disc is about four times more extended than the observed one .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the decreasing thermal energy , i.e. the significantly lower emission , with disc radius .",
    "hence , the true size of a protostellar disc ( or at least the part of the disc which is seen in keplerian rotation ) can be significantly underestimated or  in case a too coarse resolution is used  no disc is detected at all .",
    "this could explain the discrepancy between observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) concerning the existence of ( keplerian ) discs around class 0 protostellar objects : given a typical resolution of a few 0.1  in these observations and the fact that we partly find emission coming from a region less than 50 au in size ( or 0.33  at 150 pc ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] and  [ fig : intensity2 ] ) , non - detections could indeed be due to a lack of resolution . as shown in section  [ sec : conditions ] , a resolution of 0.1  or better may be required to properly investigate the presence of keplerian discs around low - mass protostellar objects .",
    "alternatively , we show that a large inclination of the disc with respect to the line - of - sight might also complicate the identification of keplerian rotation signatures . nevertheless , our results demonstrate that in general alma should be able to detect discs and to probe their dynamics under a variety of ( observational and physical ) conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ) .",
    "we again note that we do not include radiative feedback in our simulations .",
    "this would result in an increased disc temperature and thus possibly stronger emission .",
    "however , since we reach temperatures up to a few 100 k in the discs even without feedback processes , we do not expect significant changes in the overall appearance of our synthetic emission maps .",
    "furthermore , radiative feedback might alter the chemical composition of the disc , e.g. by desorption of molecules from grain surfaces . probing this , however , would be beyond the scope of this work .      in section  [ sec : pvdiag ]",
    "we have introduced a method to identify the `` upper '' edge of a keplerian profile in a pv diagram .",
    "we show that with this method with alma it should be possible to determine the mass of the central object with reasonable accuracy from a pv diagram ( see tables  [ tab : fits ] and  [ tab : fitsincl ] ) .",
    "this suggests that observationally obtained protostellar masses should be relatively reliable .",
    "overall , for edge - on discs protostellar masses might be slightly underestimated , while they might be overestimated for inclined discs .",
    "the latter is caused by confusion of disc emission and accreting or infalling gas in the foreground .    as explained in detail in section  [ sec : upper ] , our method to determine the maximum rotation velocity @xmath16 from a pv diagram aims to fit the `` upper '' edge of the emission ( see red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_diag ] ) . a different approach widely used in literature to determine @xmath16 is to use the pixel with the maximum intensity for each radius or alternatively for each velocity channel @xcite . inspecting the pv diagram for @xmath0co @xmath11 = 2  1 of model 1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upper ] shows that the pixels with the maximum intensities ( red and green curve ) tend to lie _ below _ the curve identified with our method ( blue curve ) , which in general would result in lower values for @xmath16 .",
    "hence , since the protostellar masses , we have obtained by fitting the `` upper '' edge , agree remarkably well with the actual mass ( see section  [ sec : pvdiag ] ) , we thus expect the other methods to _ underestimate _ the actual protostellar mass .",
    "we therefore suggest that , in order to determine protostellar masses , one should  if possible ",
    "try to identify the `` upper '' edge of the pv diagram rather than the pixel with the maximum intensity .",
    "we note that the outcomes of our fitting routine are naturally somewhat dependent on the chosen threshold , which we here set to 5 times the noise level in the pv diagrams . decreasing the threshold too drastically ( e.g. to 3 times the noise level ) , we find that this results in a large number of outliers ( pixels with high velocities ) , which artificially increase the protostellar mass . on the other hand , using a too high limit",
    "would define an `` upper '' edge at too low velocity values , thus leading to too small masses .",
    "changing the threshold to 4 and 6 times the noise level results in protostellar masses which differ from the value obtained with the original limit by about 0.5  2 m@xmath5 for model 1 and a few times 0.1 m@xmath5 for model 2 .",
    "since this uncertainty is larger than the fitting uncertainty , we therefore strongly recommend to double - check the fit by eye .",
    "however , despite this constraint , we are confident that our approach gives more accurate results than that by determining the maximum intensity .",
    "we emphasise that it has already been successfully applied to real alma data .      synthetic alma observations ,",
    "though not using casa , were also produced by @xcite using different tracers like nh@xmath17 and ch@xmath17cn . in general , the emission coming from their disc appears to be somewhat more extended ( a few 100 au , see their fig .",
    "2 ) than the rather concentrated emission in this work . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity_wide ] , considering only the emission coming from channels which are off by 5  15 km s@xmath18 from the systemic velocity , the emission gets more widespread and anisotropic , thus in better agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , we speculate that the differences in the disc sizes might be due to the fact that @xcite did not include magnetic fields in their simulation , which might remove angular momentum from the centre of the molecular cloud core thus decreasing the final disc size .",
    "more recently , in a complementary work , @xcite have evaluated disc masses from synthetic continuum emission maps showing that ( sub-)millimetre observations usually tend to underestimate disc masses .",
    "in contrast , when taking into account the large - scale emission @xcite find that disc masses inferred from millimetre observations agree rather well with the actual mass .",
    "they also investigate the dynamics of a keplerian disc by means of synthetic co line emission maps .",
    "the authors , however , do not consider any telescope effects like incomplete coverage in the uv - plane or noise , required for mimicking alma observations .",
    "nonetheless , the detection of clear keplerian rotation profiles in their pv diagrams strongly supports our result that alma is able to identify the dynamics of protostellar discs in the class 0 stage .",
    "modelling the chemical evolution of protoplanetary discs , @xcite find that e.g. the abundance of h@xmath3co varies between 10@xmath19 ",
    "10@xmath20 depending on whether gas in- or outside the disc spiral arms is considered .",
    "moreover , they find that hco@xmath2 has an abundance of about 10@xmath21 in agreement with more recent simulations @xcite and observations @xcite . hence , using fixed fractional abundances for the different molecules ( see section  [ sec : synobs ] ) is most likely an oversimplification .",
    "we therefore consider synthetic alma simulations of the lines p - h@xmath3co ( 218.2 ghz ) and hco@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 of model 1 and 2 for the edge - on case using a reduced fractional abundance of 2 @xmath22 10@xmath23 for h@xmath3co and 1 @xmath22 10@xmath21 for hco@xmath2 , i.e. lower values than used before .    from the intensity maps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowabundance ] in the appendix ) we find that even for the lower abundances the discs are clearly recognisable .",
    "in particular for model 1 the emission is now more widespread and somewhat more noisy .",
    "overall , for the four models considered , the total flux is decreased by roughly a factor of 3  4 .    despite the lower intensities ,",
    "the pv diagrams still reveal clear signs of a keplerian rotation profile . applying the upper - edge fits",
    ", we find protostellar masses of @xmath24 m@xmath5 ( hco@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 , model 1 ) , @xmath25 m@xmath5 ( p - h@xmath3co ( 218.2 ghz ) , model 1 ) , @xmath26 m@xmath5 ( hco@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 , model 2 ) , and @xmath27 m@xmath5 ( p - h@xmath3co ( 218.2 ghz ) , model 2 ) . except maybe for the line hco@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 in model 1 , these are still in reasonable agreement with the actual protostellar masses of 15.3 m@xmath5 and 0.62 m@xmath5 .",
    "since we do not include any stellar feedback in our simulations , we might , in particular for model 1 , underestimate the gas temperatures in the vicinity of the protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to account for this , we first calculate the luminosities of the protostars found in our simulations . for this",
    "we use the protostellar evolution model of @xcite , which takes into account the internal stellar luminosity as well as the accretion luminosity . in a second step",
    "we then calculate the dust temperature via a monte - carlo simulation performed with radmc-3d . in a final step we update the gas temperature , applying the following approach : since the gas density is relatively high in the regions of interest ( typically above 10@xmath28 particles/@xmath29 ) , it can be assumed that gas and dust are thermally tightly coupled and that their temperatures should be roughly equal .",
    "for this reason , in each grid cell we set the gas temperature to the dust temperature in case that the latter is higher . in case",
    "that the original gas temperature is higher , we leave it unchanged . in this manner , we obtain a rough estimate of the impact of stellar feedback .",
    "we then redo the synthetic alma observations of the lines @xmath0co , @xmath11 = 2  1 and h@xmath0co@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 of both models for the edge - on - case .",
    "inspecting the integrated intensity maps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corrgastemp ] in the appendix ) , it can be seen that in particular for @xmath0co , @xmath11 = 2  1 they overall signal - to - noise level is increased , which is also reflected by the 7 and 2 times higher total flux for model 1 and model 2 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , for h@xmath0co@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 the obtained fluxes are somewhat lower ( @xmath30 ) for model 1 and only marginally higher ( @xmath31 ) for model 2 .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that h@xmath0co@xmath2 is excited into higher states ( e.g. the @xmath11 = 4  3 line ) . however , in all cases it is possible to determine the protostellar masses from the pv diagrams , which gives masses of @xmath32 m@xmath5 ( @xmath0co , @xmath11 = 2  1 , model 1 ) , @xmath33 m@xmath5 ( h@xmath0co@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 , model 1 ) , @xmath34 m@xmath5 ( @xmath0co , @xmath11 = 2  1 , model 2 ) , and @xmath35 m@xmath5 ( h@xmath0co@xmath2 , @xmath11 = 3  2 , model 2 ) .",
    "the values are somewhat higher than those listed in table  [ tab : fits ] , which we attribute to the higher signal - to - noise level in the pv diagrams .",
    "this has a similar effect as lowering the threshold value in the upper - edge fitting approach and thus leads to somewhat higher protostellar masses ( see section  [ sec : upperedge ] ) .    to summarize , even though our models contain some uncertainties in the chemical composition and gas temperature , the tests performed in this section demonstrate that the general conclusion that alma is able to study keplerian discs around class 0 protostars seems to hold .",
    "in this work we have presented synthetic alma observations of two keplerian , protostellar discs in the class 0 stage formed in high - resolution , 3d - mhd simulations .",
    "one of the discs contains a low - mass protostar whereas the other contains a system of 4 low- to intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we investigate how such discs appear in alma observations , whether the keplerian rotation profile can be identified in pv diagrams , and what protostellar masses can be inferred . finally , we give some guidance for observational parameters needed for future observations .",

    "we summarize our main results , which where obtained assuming optimal observing conditions :    * with alma it is / will be possible to detect class 0 protostellar discs and velocity gradients in the 0th and 1st - order moment maps for all lines considered . in general",
    "the emission comes from the innermost part ( @xmath36 50 au ) and is thus somewhat more concentrated than the keplerian rotation part of the discs ( @xmath37 70 au ) .",
    "we find that a resolution of a few 0.1  might be too low to detect keplerian discs around class 0 objects for some low - mass protostellar systems .",
    "* more extended regions can be probed by transitions with lower @xmath11 values , although here the signal - to - noise ratio is somewhat smaller .",

    "the pv diagrams of edge - on discs reveal a clear keplerian profile extending up to 100 au reproducing the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "protostellar masses determined by fitting a keplerian rotation curve to the pv diagram are in general accurate within a few 10 percent . for the edge - on seen discs , in most of the cases the protostellar mass",
    "is slightly underestimated .",
    "* we show that keplerian rotation profiles are recognisable even for strongly inclined discs ( up to 30@xmath38 ) .",

    "<S> we model the emission of discs around low- and intermediate - mass protostars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that under optimal observing conditions alma is able to detect the discs already in the earliest stage of protostellar evolution , although the emission is often concentrated to the innermost 50 au </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , a resolution of a few 0.1  might be too low to detect keplerian discs around class 0 objects . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that under optimal conditions for edge - on discs keplerian rotation signatures are recognisable , from which protostellar masses can be inferred . for this </S>",
    "<S> we here introduce a new approach , which allows us to determine protostellar masses with higher fidelity than before . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that it is possible to reveal keplerian rotation even for strongly inclined discs and that alma should be able to detect possible signs of fragmentation in face - on discs . in order to give some guidance for future alma observations , we investigate the influence of varying observing conditions and source distances . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to probe keplerian rotation in inclined discs with an observing time of 2 h and a resolution of 0.1  , even in the case of moderate weather conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that under optimal conditions , keplerian discs around intermediate - mass protostars should be detectable up to kpc - distances .    </S>",
