    "in the past the heavy quarkonia have usually been investigated in the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . because of the large mass of the @xmath3 or @xmath4 quark the nonrelativistic treatment of the bound state problem",
    "is expected to be a good first approximation .",
    "however in charmonium one still finds typical velocities of @xmath5 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , so that relativistic effects should become important especially for electroweak decay properties , as has been shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "relativistic calculations for the heavy quarkonia have been reported e.g. by tiemeijer and tjon @xcite who compare various quasipotential approximations to the bs - equation , by gara et.al .",
    "@xcite within the framework of the reduced salpeter equation , and by murota @xcite who uses the ( full ) salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these authors only give the mass spectra and do not calculate any decay widths , which should be most sensitive to relativistic effects .",
    "in the present contribution we obtain the mass spectra as well as the leptonic , two - photon , e1 and m1 decay widths in the framework of the ( full ) salpeter equation .",
    "we parametrize confinement by a linearly rising scalar or a vector interaction kernel and take into account the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction in the instantaneous approximation .",
    "the salpeter equation is then solved numerically according to the treatment outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the decay widths is performed in the mandelstam formalism @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[hi ] we give the explicit form of the interaction kernel and briefly review the formalism for the calculation of the decay widths .",
    "the model parameters and results are discussed in sec.[hii ] , and we give some concluding remarks in sec.[hiii ] .",
    "for an instantaneous bs - kernel and free propagators with effective quark masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 one can perform the @xmath8 integrals in the bs - equation in the rest frame of the bound state with mass @xmath9 and thus arrives at the ( full ) salpeter equation @xmath10 \\,\\gamma^0\\,\\lambda^+_2(-\\vec{p } ) } { m+\\omega_1+\\omega_2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\int \\!\\!\\frac{d^3p'}{(2\\pi)^3}\\ , \\frac{\\lambda^+_1(\\vec{p})\\,\\gamma^0\\ , [ ( v(\\vec{p},\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) ] \\,\\gamma^0\\,\\lambda^-_2(-\\vec{p } ) } { m-\\omega_1-\\omega_2 }   \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 and the projection operators @xmath12 on positive and negative energies , where @xmath13 is the standard dirac hamiltonian ( for the notation we refer to refs.@xcite ) .    the confinement plus oge interaction kernel applied in the present work reads @xmath14 = \\left[v_c(\\vec{p},\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\right ] + \\left[v_g(\\vec{p},\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\right]\\ ] ] where the scalar or vector confining part is given by @xmath15 & = & \\;\\;\\;{\\cal v}_c((\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\,')^2)\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) \\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{or } \\label{ccscalar } \\\\ \\left[v_c^v(\\vec{p},\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\right ] & = & -{\\cal      v}_c((\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\,')^2)\\,\\gamma^0\\,\\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\,\\gamma^0 \\label{ccvector}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "here @xmath16 is a scalar function with the fourier transform @xmath17 .    for the oge kernel @xmath18 we have to note that it is not possible to formulate this term in a gauge - invariant way , since for a gauge - invariant kernel it is essential to take into account crossed gluon diagrams .",
    "however , for such diagrams the instantaneous approximation can not be applied in a straightforward way .",
    "furthermore , also in a noninstantaneous treatment the incorporation of crossed diagrams is technically very difficult , so that it would be very hard to go beyond the gauge - dependent ladder approximation .    in view of the instantaneous treatment of the oge",
    "the natural gauge for the gluon propagator is the coulomb gauge , which will be applied in the following .",
    "the advantage of this gauge is the fact that the gluon propagator given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 is already instantaneous in its component @xmath21 . in the instantaneous approximation",
    "we substitute @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "the oge kernel then reads @xcite @xmath24 = { \\cal v}_g((\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\,')^2 ) \\,\\left [ \\gamma^0 \\phi(\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) \\,\\gamma^0 -\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\left ( \\vec{\\gamma } \\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\ , \\vec{\\gamma } + ( \\vec{\\gamma}\\hat{x } ) \\phi(\\vec{p}\\,')\\ , ( \\vec{\\gamma}\\hat{x})\\ , \\right)\\,\\right ] \\label{couleq}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 we do nt specify the operator @xmath26 explicitely in momentum space since the corresponding matrix elements are evaluated in coordinate space . in analogy to the treatment of the confinement matrix elements in ref.@xcite also the matrix elements of @xmath27 are evaluated in coordinate space . for the numerical calculation",
    "we will therefore obtain an analytic expression for the fourier transformed oge potential @xmath28 in the following .",
    "in qcd the running coupling constant for @xmath29 is given by @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 where in the instantaneous approximation we set @xmath32 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath33 behaves like @xmath34 for @xmath35 and reaches a saturation value @xmath36 for @xmath37 with some smooth interpolation in between .",
    "the fourier transformation of the oge kernel can now be performed analytically in the short and long distance region . for @xmath38",
    "only small @xmath39 are important in the fourier integral and we can set @xmath40 so that @xmath41 analogously for @xmath42 we set @xmath43 and obtain ( see appendix [ alfasapp ] ) @xmath44      \\label{arun}\\\\ & & \\mbox{with}\\;\\;a=\\lambda_{qcd}\\,r \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "an interpolation between these two limiting cases is given by @xmath46 \\label{alfasr}\\ ] ] ( see ref.@xcite for the case @xmath47 ) , where we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 in order to obtain a smooth behaviour for intermediate @xmath50 .    the salpeter equation with @xmath51 is well defined .",
    "this is in contrast to the corresponding schrdinger equation where the terms of order @xmath52 like the spin - spin and spin - orbit interaction lead to a collaps of the wavefunction into the origin , i.e. the fermi - breit hamiltonian is unbound from below .",
    "this defect is usually cured by using first order perturbation theory or by regularizing the @xmath53 potential for small @xmath50 .    for the salpeter equation",
    "this problem disappears due to the relativistic treatment of the quark motion .",
    "however , most salpeter amplitudes are divergent for @xmath54 , as has been shown explicitely by murota @xcite for a fixed coupling constant . for a running coupling constant",
    "this divergence is less pronounced , but still present .",
    "the amplitudes are normalizable , but problems occur for decay observables like the leptonic decay widths , which depend on the value of the amplitudes at @xmath54 . the easiest way to cure these divergencies is to regularize the oge kernel for small @xmath50 .",
    "we therefore will use the regularized potential @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 determined by the condition that @xmath28 and its first derivative are continuous functions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath59 and @xmath60 given by eq.([alfasr ] ) is not strong and can be compensated for by modifying @xmath61 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will use @xmath62 and @xmath63 for our calculation .",
    "a plot of @xmath64 is shown in fig.[vgfig ] .",
    "the dependence of the mass spectra on the regularization parameter @xmath65 is very weak so that the differences in the mass spectra calculated with the regularized and unregularized potential are quite small . for our further calculation",
    "we will take @xmath66 .",
    "the general prescription for the calculation of any current matrix element between bound states has been given by mandelstam @xcite , see e.g. @xcite for a textbook treatment .",
    "the explicit formulas for the leptonic and two - photon decay widths are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "since these transitions involve a non - hadronic final state they can be calculated in the rest frame of the bound state where also the amplitudes are determined .",
    "the calculation of e1 and m1 transitions , however , involves a boost of at least one of the meson amplitudes .",
    "a covariant formulation of the salpeter equation @xcite enables to treat this boost correctly , i.e. we make the ansatz that the bs - kernel @xmath67 can be written covariantly as @xmath68 where , together with an analogous reformulation for the spin structure of @xmath67 .",
    "explicitely eq.([couleq ] ) can be rewritten in a covariant form by replacing @xmath69 ( and the same for @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "since the details for the calculation of electromagnetic transitions within the present framework have already been given in detail in ref.@xcite , we will only review the basic steps in the following .    from the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath73\\ , s^f_2(-p_2)\\ ] ] with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 one finds that the amputated bs amplitude or vertex function @xmath77^{-1 } \\,\\chi_p(p)\\;[s^f_2(-p_2)]^{-1 } $ ] may be computed in the rest frame from the equal time amplitude @xmath78 as @xmath79 \\label{vert}\\ ] ]    because of the covariant ansatz of the interaction kernel the kinematical boost @xmath80 with @xmath81 gives the solution of the equation for any momentum @xmath82 of the bound state , i.e. @xmath83 ( and @xmath84 analogously ) .",
    "the electromagnetic current between two bound states may now be calculated from the bs amplitudes and a kernel @xmath85 which is irreducible with respect to the incoming and outgoing quark antiquark pair , i.e. it includes all diagrams that may not be divided by just cutting the quark and the antiquark line . in lowest order the matrix element of the electromagnetic quark current taken between bound states with momenta @xmath86 and @xmath87 as shown in fig .",
    "[ kgampt ] reads explicitely @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the charge of the quark and @xmath90 the momentum of the photon . as in the bs - equation",
    "we will use @xmath91 .",
    "the calculation of the current is performed in the rest frame of the incoming particle , i.e. @xmath92 , the results however are independent of this choice because of the formal covariance .",
    "the @xmath8 integral picks up only the residues of the one particle poles , the @xmath93 dependence is trivial for decays in z - direction and the resulting twodimensional integral in @xmath94 and @xmath95 is calculated by gaussian integration , compare @xcite for the details .",
    "the electromagnetic decay width follows from the well known formula for the decay rate with @xmath96 the momentum , @xmath97 the polarization and @xmath98 the polarization vector of the photon , i.e. @xmath99",
    "we investigate two different models of the confinement kernel : 1 ) a scalar @xmath100- and 2 ) a vector @xmath101-structure .",
    "the parameters used are the charm and bottom quark masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the offset @xmath104 and slope @xmath105 of the confinement interaction and the saturation value @xmath36 for @xmath58 in eq.([alfasr ] ) .",
    "these five parameters have been adjusted to the mass spectra by minimizing a @xmath106 that incorporates all known charmonium and bottomonium ground states and first excited states .",
    "the resulting parameter sets are given in tab.[ccbbpar ] for the scalar ( s ) and the vector ( v ) confinement .",
    "the main difference between the two parameter sets is given by the larger value of @xmath36 for the scalar confinement .",
    "this can be easily understood from the nonrelativistic picture where the spin - orbit force coming from the scalar confinement counteracts the oge spin - orbit force , whereas for the vector confinement both spin - orbit forces affect the mass spectra in the same way .",
    "therefore , in order to compensate the reduced spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath107-states in the scalar confining case , the strength of the oge interaction has to be increased . compared to nonrelativistic calculations @xcite we find smaller quark masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "it is remarkable that the slope of the confining potential comes out much larger than in nonrelativistic models , where a typical value is @xmath108 mev / fm @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that in nonrelativistic calculations the kinetic energy given by @xmath109 is overestimated . in semirelativistic models based on the relativistic expression @xmath110 ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) already higher values @xmath111 mev / fm have to be used to compensate for the smaller kinetic energy .",
    "similar values for @xmath105 have also been found by gara and coworkers within the reduced salpeter approach @xcite .",
    "the admixture of the negative energy components within our full salpeter approach leads to a further enlargement for @xmath105 .",
    "the mass spectra of charmonium are given in figs.[ccspecscal],[ccspecvec ] , the mass spectra of bottomonium are shown in figs.[bbspecscal],[bbspecvec ] for both confinement spin structures .",
    "the experimental data are usually taken from the particle data group @xcite .",
    "for the recent measurement of the mass of the charmonium @xmath112 state ( @xmath113 ) in @xmath114 annihilations by the e760 collaboration at fermilab see ref.@xcite . we find that both confinement spin structures give a reasonable overall description of the experimental mass spectra .",
    "the spin - spin and spin - orbit splittings are slightly better described for the vector confinement , whereas the radial excitations of the vector mesons are slightly better for the scalar confinement .",
    "however , we feel that these differences are not significant enough to decide wether the lorentz nature of confinement should be of the scalar or vector type .",
    "this is in contrast to the nonrelativistic quark model where a scalar confinement gives the better results .",
    "although the description of the mass spectra can be considered quite satisfactory , there remain some characteristic deviations :    i ) : :    we find that the binding of the @xmath2 meson tends to be    quite large . as a consequence it is not possible for a scalar    confinement to obtain a satisfying simultaneous description of the    hyperfine splitting @xmath115 and    the fine splitting    @xmath116 .",
    "the problem is less prominent for the vector    confinement due to the smaller value of @xmath36    ( see fig.[feyngauge ] ) .",
    "ii ) : :    the large value of the confinement slope @xmath105 leads to an    overestimation for the level spacing between the s - wave states of the    vector mesons , whereas the mass differences of s - waves and d - waves is    underestimated , especially for higher radial excitations .    to estimate the influence of the gauge chosen for the gluon propagator we also investigated the feynman gauge given by @xmath117 = { \\cal v}_g((\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\,')^2)\\ , \\gamma^{\\mu } \\phi(\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) \\,\\gamma_{\\mu } \\label{feyneq}\\ ] ] as shown in fig.[feyngauge ] the binding energy of the @xmath2 meson",
    "is overestimated for this gauge .",
    "it turns out that it is not possible to compensate for this effect in a satisfying way by readjusting the model parameters .",
    "the effect of the gauge on the other states is less important .",
    "it should be noted that due to the large quark masses the rpa - instability of the salpeter equation with a scalar confinement as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is invisible here for any accessible number of basis states .",
    "a reasonably small number of basis states ( eleven states have been used in our calculation ) thus serves as a regularization supressing the very high momenta @xmath118 which lead to the mentioned instability .",
    "we therefore think that it is legitimate to compare the ( quasistable ) solutions to the experimental meson masses .",
    "note that for light quarks , however , the instability spoils a reasonable description of light mesons for a scalar confinement , whereas for a @xmath119 -vector confinement the solutions remain stable .      as shown in tables.[ccdec ] and [ e1m1 ] most decay widths show only small differences between both confinement spin structures .",
    "the improvement due to the relativistic treatment is seen most clearly in the two - photon decay of the @xmath120 and in the leptonic widths of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( where a larger s - wave admixture , e.g. due to coupled channel effects , could improve the results ) .",
    "the leptonic decay widths of the @xmath0 s - wave vector mesons are generally too large by a factor of @xmath123 for the @xmath124 and more for the higher radial excitations , whereas they are too small for the @xmath125 .",
    "we were not able to adjust the model parameters in order to find a better agreement with the experimental widths , since an increased leptonic width of the @xmath125 is usually connected with an increased @xmath124 width . furthermore the leptonic widths turn out to be quite insensitive to changes of the parameters which still allow for a reasonable description of the mass spectra .",
    "the incorporation of the commonly used qcd correction factor @xmath126 @xcite does obviously not improve these results , since the leptonic widths of the @xmath124 and the @xmath125 would be changed in the same way .",
    "the leptonic widths of the radially excited @xmath127 states come out closer to the experimental data . however , the decay widths for higher radial excitations are too large compared to the widths of the lower excitations .",
    "this is due to the large value of the confinement slope @xmath105 which leads to an overestimation of the salpeter amplitudes at @xmath128 for the higher excitations .    for the e1 and m1 transition widths we find some improvement compared to the nonrelativistic results for the transitions @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "however , for the other transitions the improvement due to relativistic effects is compensated by the influence of the large confinement slope @xmath105 on the salpeter amplitudes .",
    "note that transition amplitudes like @xmath132 are very sensitive to the position of the knot of the 2s amplitude ..      in two previous papers @xcite we have investigated the mass spectra , decay widths and electromagnetic form factors of light mesons within an analogous approach . for the description of the heavy quarkonia we have replaced the instanton - induced residual interaction ( t hooft interaction ) applied for the light mesons by the oge interaction .",
    "there are two reasons which lead to this different treatment for light and heavy mesons :    i ) : :    the similarity of the charmonium and bottomonium mass spectra and the    mass spectrum of positronium indicates that the oge is a reasonable    first approximation of the short - distance interaction between heavy    quarks . for light quarks",
    ", however , the oge leads to degenerate    @xmath133 and @xmath134 masses in clear contradiction    with experiment , whereas the t hooft interaction naturally solves    this problem and leads to flavormixing for the @xmath134 and    @xmath135 mesons .",
    "ii ) : :    the t hooft interaction does not give first order contributions to    the interaction between two charmed or bottom quarks because of the    flavor antisymmetry of this interaction .",
    "effects can only occur via    flavor mixing in second order , but the large differences in the meson    masses suppress such contributions .",
    "furthermore there are no    experimental indications for other flavors contributing significantly    to @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we found that also for the light mesons a large value of @xmath136 mev / fm ( model v2 in ref.@xcite ) had been necessary to describe higher radial excitations and higher angular momenta @xmath137 . on the other hand ignoring higher radial excitations and angular momenta ( model v1 in the same reference ) enabled a very good description of the light pseudoscalar and vector meson ground states ( i.e. @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath67 , @xmath138 etc . ) including various decay widths and form factors ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this fit a much smaller value of @xmath139 mev / fm had to be used which is comparable to typical values in nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "we investigated the heavy quarkonia in the framework of the salpeter equation with a linear scalar or vector confinement plus the one - gluon - exchange interaction . for the mass spectra and the decay widths we obtained a reasonable overall agreement with the experimental meson masses for a scalar as well as for a vector confining kernel .",
    "this is in contrast to the nonrelativistic quark model where a scalar confinement is prefered .",
    "the relativistic framework leads to an improved description especially for the two - photon decay of the @xmath120 and the leptonic decays of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "minor improvements are also found for most e1 transitions .",
    "for the other decay widths the influence of relativistic effects is compensated by the effect of the large value of the confinement slope @xmath105 . as a consequence the masses of the higher radial excitations and the leptonic decays can not be described in a satisfying way .",
    "we find that relativistic effects can be important , especially for the description of certain decays .",
    "one would expect that the covariant formulation applied in the present work should yield a systematic improvement compared to nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "however , our results for the heavy quarkonia indicate that this is not the case , which we blame on the fact that the description of confinement via a potential is not an adequate concept within a relativistic treatment .",
    "we conclude that despite some success for certain decay widths the salpeter approach does not allow for a satisfying description of higher radial excitations and higher angular momenta .",
    "in this section we will analytically perform the fourier transformation of the oge kernel into coordinate space for @xmath140 as given by @xmath141 the cutoff @xmath142 has been introduced to keep the variable @xmath143 in the high momentum range where the qcd formula for the running coupling constant is approximately valid .",
    "the other cutoff @xmath144 has been introduced for formal reasons as shown below .",
    "it is chosen according to the condition @xmath145 .",
    "we basically follow the way outlined by lucha et.al .",
