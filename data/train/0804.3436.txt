    "dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) could lead to new spintronic devices where both the electronic charge and spin can be controlled . for practical applications , dms with curie temperature , @xmath0 , above room temperature are required .",
    "the ( ga , mn)as is regarded as a classic example with robust ferromagnetism @xcite , but the highest reported @xmath0 s are still well below room temperature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , p - type ( zn , mn)o has been predicted to be a room temperature ferromagnet @xcite , where ferromagnetism above room temperature has been observed for mn doped pure zno @xcite , or mn doped p - type zno @xcite .",
    "however , contradictory experimental results have also been reported for ( zn , mn)o such as ferromagnetism below room temperature @xcite , absence of ferromagnetism @xcite , spin glass behavior @xcite , or paramagnetism @xcite .",
    "the possibility of room - temperature ferromagnetism motivates the theoretical research on the origin and control of high - temperature ferromagnetism in semiconductors , especially zno - based dms , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "magnetic impurities in ordinary metals exhibit the well - known ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) oscillations , which is a carrier mediated indirect coupling due to the friedel oscillations of the polarized carriers around the impurities .",
    "when magnetic impurities are doped into a semiconductor host , quite different behaviors are experimentally observed as mentioned above .",
    "the haldane - anderson impurity model had been introduced to study transition - metal impurities in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of dms , the magnetic properties of this model were addressed within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite , and it was shown that long - range ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations develop when the fermi level is located between the top of the valence band and the impurity bound state ( ibs ) . the fm interaction between the impurities",
    "is mediated by the impurity - induced polarization of the valence electron spins , which exhibit an antiferromagnetic coupling to the impurity moments .",
    "subsequent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite on the two - impurity haldane - anderson model with the hirsch - fye algorithm have supported this picture for the generation of fm correlations between magnetic impurities in semiconductors .",
    "various other theoretical approaches have also been used to study magnetic impurities in semiconductors .",
    "the zener model has been invoked to describe the ferromagnetism in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations based on local spin density approximation ( lsda ) have also found that magnetic states and corresponding curie temperatures in zno - based dms are controlled by changing the carrier density or the magnetic impurity concentration @xcite . within the context of dms ,",
    "the anderson hamiltonian for a semiconductor host was also considered by krstaji _",
    "@xcite , and it was shown that an fm interaction is generated between the impurities due to kinematic exchange . the role of ibs in producing the fm interaction in dms was also discussed within the  double resonance mechanism \" using hf @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present qmc results for the compound ( zn , mn)o . for zno host ,",
    "the wurtzite structure is the most common phase , and thus almost all experiments for zno are focused on this structure . but zno with the zincblende and the rocksalt structures are also experimentally possible in thin films and at high pressure , respectively @xcite .",
    "the band structures of zno with the wurtzite , zincblende and rocksalt structures had been already calculated within a single set of tight - binding parameters @xcite , and we will follow these results in this paper to study the ferromagnetism for the compound ( zn , mn)o with experimentally determined values for the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing and the onsite coulomb repulsion @xcite . for the doped mn@xmath3 impurity , we neglect the hund coupling among the five occupied @xmath4 orbitals , and , for simplicity , consider the @xmath4 orbitals independently . in the dilute impurity limit , the haldane - anderson impurity model is invoked to describe the magnetic states of mn@xmath3 ions .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations show that the crystal structure of the zno host strongly influences the energy of the ibs and the strength of the magnetic correlations between the impurities . in particular , for the wurtzite and zincblende structures , we find that fm correlations with an extended range develop at low temperatures .",
    "however , for the rocksalt structure , fm correlations have not been observed , because , in this case , the ibs is located at much higher frequencies . in addition , only p - type ( zn , mn)o is found to exhibit fm correlations .",
    "in this paper , our purpose is to investigate the influence of the crystal structure of the semiconductor host on the fm correlations between the impurities . for this purpose , we combine the tight - binding calculations for the host band structure and the impurity - host hybridization with the qmc simulations .",
    "our impurity model is simple , because we neglect the hund couplings and consider only one of the @xmath4 orbitals at the impurity site .",
    "however , this model is sufficient to demonstrate that the host crystal structure can be used to control ferromagnetism in dms . instead of the tight - binding approximation",
    ", the local density approximations ( lda ) can be used to calculate the host band structure and the impurity - host hybridization .",
    "in addition , it is possible to perform qmc simulations for all five of the impurity @xmath4 orbitals with the hund couplings .",
    "we think that this way of combining the lda and qmc techniques can yield accurate predictions about ferromagnetism in dms materials in the future .",

    "the top of the valence band , located at the @xmath37 point , is at 0.6 ev , while the @xmath36 point is at -0.53 ev .",

    "we will use these values in the rest of this paper .",
    "it is established that , for the wurtzite or zincblende crystal structures , the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing is dominated by the occupied @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) orbitals because of the tetrahedral crystal field , while for the rocksalt structure , the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing comes mainly from the occupied @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) orbitals due to the octahedral crystal field @xcite .",

    "the semiconductor gap edges are located at the @xmath36 point , hence the value of @xmath65 near @xmath36 will be particularly important in determining the energy of the ibs and the strength of the magnetic correlations between the impurities .",
    "figures 2(c ) and ( d ) show that , for the case of a mn @xmath66 orbital in zno with the zincblende structure , the total hybridization with the valence bands is also stronger than that with the conduction bands near the @xmath36 point .",

    "we note that , in turn , the hybridization depends strongly on the values of the mixing parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the tight - binding approach .",
    "in this section , we present results on the impurity magnetic correlations , which were obtained using the hirsch - fye qmc technique @xcite .",
    "the input parameters for the qmc simulations were calculated with the tight - binding approach described above .",

    "hence , @xmath70 represents the square of the local - moment for a single @xmath4 orbital added to the zno host .",
    "figure 3(a ) and ( b ) shows results on @xmath70 for a @xmath66 orbital in wurtzite and zincblende structures and a @xmath67 orbital in the rocksalt zno . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath73 versus the chemical potential @xmath18 is plotted for @xmath74ev and in fig .",
    "3(b ) for @xmath75ev .",
    "these results are for temperature @xmath76 . in these figures ,",
    "we observe discontinuities at @xmath77ev , @xmath78ev and @xmath79ev for the zincblende , wurtzite and rocksalt structures , respectively .",
    "according to the hartee - fock and qmc calculations , the presence of a discontinuity in @xmath80 versus @xmath18 implies the existence of an ibs at this energy @xcite .",
    "a step discontinuity develops in the magnitude of the magnetic moment as @xmath18 increases through @xmath81 , because impurity spectral weight is induced in the semiconductor gap at @xmath81 for sufficiently strong hybridization .",
    "when the ibs is occupied , the spin polarization of the host split - off state , which is due to the impurity - host mixing and at the same energy as the ibs , will cancel the spin polarization of the valence band .",
    "thus antiferromagnetic couplings between the polarized host carriers and the impurities disappear .",
    "this causes the fm interaction between the impurities , which is mediated by the polarized carriers around the magnetic impurities , to vanish . in this paper",
    ", we are studying how this mechanism of ferromagnetic correlations is influenced by the crystal structure of the the zno host .",
    "the variation in the values of @xmath81 for different crystal structures seen in fig .",
    "3 is clearly a consequence of the differences in the energy bands and the impurity - host mixing .",
    "in addition , the values of the hybridization with the bottom of the conduction bands are weaker , and hence we do not observe bound states near the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the value of @xmath81 plays an important role in determining the strength of the fm correlations which develop between the impurities when the ibs is unoccupied . within the hartree - fock approximation and for a semiconductor host with constant density of states @xmath82 and semi - infinite bands @xcite , the range of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations between the impurities is given by @xmath83 when the ibs is unoccupied ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , when the ibs becomes occupied ( @xmath85 ) , the fm correlations become weaker .",
    "the qmc calculations performed for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor host with quadratic quasiparticle dispersion confirm this picture @xcite .",
    "these qmc calculations show that , in 2d , @xmath81 increases as the strength of the hybridization grows .",
    "the maximum range of the fm correlations decreases as @xmath81 increases in agreement with the hf calculations .",
    "however , in the three - dimensional case , the ibs does not exist , if the hybridization is smaller than a critical value @xcite .    in the following calculations",
    ", we will see that the magnetic correlations between the impurities are sensitive to the location of the chemical potential with respect to the ibs .",
    "an ibs with shallower position ( @xmath86 ev ) is obtained for ( zn , mn)o with the zinblende structure , while a much deeper ibs ( @xmath87 ev ) is found for the rocksalt case .",
    "based on the previous hf and qmc calculations @xcite , it is reasonable to expect that the fm correlation range for ( zn , mn)o with the wurtzite structure will be shorter than that with the zincblende structure , and will be much longer than that of the rocksalt case .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that the ibs for ( zn , mn)o with wurtzite and zincblende structures only exists near the top of valence band , while no ibs is found near the bottom of conduction band . if , instead of mn@xmath3 , another transition metal ion tm@xmath3 is substituted into the zno host , then the only different quantities would be the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing parameters ( @xmath88 ) and ( @xmath89 ) within this framework .",
    "in particular , for various hosts and transition - metal impurities , the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing parameters , which are consistent with the experimental measurements , are mostly in the range @xmath90 ev@xmath91 - 1.0 ev @xcite , while @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we have checked the ibs for ( zn , tm)o for various @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing values in the above mentioned range .",
    "we find that , when smaller values are used for the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , the ibs shifts towards the top of valence band , while at the same time no ibs develops near the bottom of the conduction band . since the doping of the transition metal ion tm@xmath3 into the zno host does not itself introduce carriers , the hole and electron carriers in ( zn , tm)o are associated with _",
    "additional _ the acceptor or donor defects , respectively .",
    "this implies that for p - type ( zn , tm)o , the fm correlations will develop when @xmath92 , while for the n - type ( zn , tm)o , no fm correlations are expected due to the absence of the ibs .",
    "in fact , the existence of p - type rather than n - type ( zn , mn)o with wurtzite structure has recently been pointed out based on the analysis of the experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "we next display results on the impurity - impurity magnetic correlation function @xmath93 versus the impurity separation @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ f - c2 ] .",
    "these results are for two mn@xmath3 @xmath4 orbitals , which are of the same type , added to the zno host .",
    "clearly , in a more realistic calculation of fm correlations between the impurities , it would be necessary to consider the magnetic correlations between different types of @xmath4 orbitals",
    ". however , our purpose in this paper is to investigate the role of the host electronic structure . in fig .",
    "4 , the temperature @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the lattice constant . in our chosen directions ,",
    "the distance between the 1st - nearest - neighboring mn@xmath3 is @xmath97 for the wurtzite structure , while it is @xmath98 for the zincblende and rocksalt structures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - c2](a ) for the wurtzite structure , the impurity spins exhibit fm correlations at @xmath99 , but it is short range . by increasing @xmath18 to 0.15 ev ,",
    "the range of the fm correlations becomes longer extending to the 3rd - nearest neighboring mn@xmath3 .",
    "further increasing @xmath18 , the fm correlations becomes weaker .",
    "this is because the ibs of ( zn , mn)o with wurtzite structure becomes occupied as @xmath18 changes above 0.15 ev , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f - c1 ] . for the zincblende structure ,",

    "we note that the compound ( zn , mn)o with the zincblende structure seems to possess a longer range for the fm correlations than that with the wurtzite structure , while almost all existing experiments for zno are focused on the wurtzite structure .",
    "not surprisingly , we have not observed magnetic correlations for the rocksalt structure in fig .",
    "[ f - c2](c ) .",
    "this is because the position of ibs for ( zn , mn)o with rocksalt structure is too deep as seen in fig .",
    "[ f - c1 ] , thus the fm correlation range @xcite is shorter than the first nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "we next study the temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic correlations between the impurities in different crystal structures .",
    "figure 5 displays the @xmath101 dependence of @xmath102 for impurities which are second - nearest neighbors in wurtzite , zincblende and rocksalt crystal structures .",
    "for wurtzite and zincblende structures , these calculations have been performed for the @xmath66 orbitals , and for the rocksalt case they are for the @xmath67 orbital .",
    "in addition , for the wurtzite and zincblende structures , the chemical potential is taken as @xmath103 ev and 0.1 ev , respectively , where the ibs is unoccupied and the longest range of the fm correlations occurs as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - c2 ] .",
    "the results for the rocksalt case are for @xmath104ev , so that the ibs is unoccupied here also .",
    "we observe that , as @xmath101 decreases from @xmath105 down to @xmath106 , the fm correlations grow for the wurtzite and zincblende structures . in this @xmath101 range ,",
    "the fm do not develop for the rocksalt case .",
    "for the zno host with the rocksalt structure , it is useful to mention previous studies @xcite which are related to the _ indirect _ energy gaps obtained with the @xmath25 tight - binding calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ f - eig](c ) . using the hartree - fock method , jaffe et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for the rocksalt zno , the point symmetry in rocksalt structure does not allow for mixing between the zn @xmath4 orbitals and the o @xmath28 orbitals at the @xmath36 point , but mixing is allowed elsewhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "thus the valence band maximum shifts away form the @xmath36 point , so that the gap becomes _ indirect_. as mentioned by skinner and lafemina in ref.@xcite , where we follow their @xmath25 tight - binding calculation for the zno host in present paper , this effect also exists even when the @xmath25 tight - binding model does not _",
    "explicitly _ include the zn @xmath4 orbitals , because the zn @xmath4 character has been _ implicitly _ included in the hopping integrals through the tight - binding interpolation of the bulk _ ab _ _ initio _ pseudopotential bands @xcite that skinner and lafemina used to derive them .",
    "however , there also exist calculations for the rocksalt zno , which are based on the quasiparticle approach @xcite and the pseudopotential method @xcite , yielding a _",
    "direct _ energy gap at the @xmath36 point . in order to understand the results observed for ( zn , mn)o with the rocksalt structure , we have considered the case of mgo , whose crystal structure is also rocksalt but has a _ direct _ energy gap at the @xmath36 point @xcite . using the tight - binding parameters given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the host basis consists of one @xmath32 orbital for mg@xmath3 and three @xmath28 orbitals for o@xmath29 , we have calculated the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing for the compound ( mg , mn)o as in the case for ( zn , mn)o . we found that , near the @xmath36 point , the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing for ( mg , mn)o with the rocksalt structure is also close to zero , where @xmath2 stands for the five @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "these results imply that the host compound with the rocksalt structure does not mix with the doped @xmath4 orbitals at the @xmath36 point regardless of whether there is a direct or indirect energy gap .",
    "in fact , this is generally true if the host with the rocksalt structure can be described using the @xmath25 tight - binding approach . at the @xmath36 point , because of the orthogonality of the @xmath32 and @xmath1 orbitals , we find that , for a fixed band @xmath42 , the coefficients @xmath107 in eq.([e - mix ] ) have only one non - zero value , for example , @xmath97 .",

    "it is obvious that the magnetic correlations between the impurities depend on the position of the ibs , while the ibs is closely related the host band structure as well as the host - impurity mixing parameters .",
    "as mentioned above , for the rocksalt zno doped with magnetic impurities , the ibs will shift to the top of valence band if we decrease the values of the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "our main purpose has been to investigate the effects of the crystal structure on the ibs and the fm correlations for the zno host . for simplicity , we have neglected the hund coupling among the mn@xmath3 @xmath4 orbitals . in addition , we have considered only one of the five @xmath4 orbitals at the impurity sites .",
    "this is clearly an over simplification , however , it does allow us to demonstrate the role of the host crystal structure in determining the energy of the ibs and the maximum range of the fm correlations .",
    "currently , we are in the process of performing qmc calculations which include all five of the @xmath4 orbitals at the impurity site without neglecting the hund couplings . in addition",
    ", we are using the lda technique , instead of the tight - binding approximation , to calculate more precisely the host band structure and the impurity - host hybridization .",
    "we think that this lda+qmc approach can be used to make accurate predictions about the fm correlations for different sets of dms materials .",
    "it is generally agreed up on that the ferromagnetism in the dms can be controlled by changing the type of the transition - metal impurities or the host semiconductor as well as the occupation of the ibs .",
    "the results presented in this paper suggest that the host crystal structure can also be used in the search for high-@xmath0 ferromagnetism in dms .",
