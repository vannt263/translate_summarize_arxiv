    "70 years ago myron mathisson has presented the equations describing the motions of a spinning test particle in a gravitational field @xcite",
    "@xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 4-velocity of a spinning particle , @xmath3 is the antisymmetric tensor of spin , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the mass and the covariant derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the riemann curvature tensor of the spacetime .",
    "( throughout this paper we use units @xmath8 .",
    "greek indices run 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and latin indices 1 , 2 , 3 ; the signature of the metric ( ,,,+ ) is chosen . )",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) were supplemented by the condition @xcite @xmath9 ( in special relativity condition ( [ 3 ] ) was introduced by j.  frenkel @xcite . )",
    "it is known @xcite that in the minkowski spacetime the mathisson equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) have , in addition to usual solutions describing the straight worldlines , a family of solutions describing the oscillatory ( helical ) worldlines ( as a partial case , this family contains the circular solutions . )    in @xcite the oscillatory solutions of equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) were connected with _",
    "`` zitterbewegung''_. c.  mller proposed another interpretation of these solutions : he pointed out that 1 ) in relativity the position of the center of mass of a rotating body depends on the frame of reference , and 2 ) condition ( [ 3 ] ) is common for the so - called proper and non - proper centers of mass @xcite .",
    "the usual solutions describe the motion of the proper center of mass of a spinning body ( particle ) , and the helical solutions describe the motions of the family of the non - proper centers of mass @xcite",
    ".    later a. papapetrou derived equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) by the method which differs from mathisson s one @xcite , and , instead of ( [ 3 ] ) , the non - covariant condition @xmath10 was used @xcite in concrete calculations .    to avoid the superfluous solutions of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , w. tulczyjew and w.  dixon introduced the covariant condition @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle s 4-momentum .",
    "in contrast to relation ( [ 3 ] ) the tulczyjew - dixon condition ( [ 5 ] ) picks out the unique worldline of a spinning test particle in the gravitational field .",
    "that is , equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) under ( [ 5 ] ) do not admit the oscillatory solutions .",
    "however , the question arises : is this worldline close , in the certain sense , to the usual ( non - helical ) worldline of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) under condition ( [ 3 ] ) , for example , in a schwarzschild field ?",
    "it is simple to answer this question when the relation @xmath13 takes place , because in this case condition ( [ 5 ] ) practically coincides with ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "for example , these conditions are equivalent for post - newtonian expansions @xcite",
    ". however , _ a priori _ another situation is possible for the highly relativistic spinning particle .",
    "naturally , this situation must be investigated carefully .",
    "note that very condition ( [ 3 ] ) was derived in some papers by different methods @xcite , and we agree with the conclusion that this condition `` ... arises in a natural fashion in the course of the derivation '' , @xcite , p.  112 .",
    "that is , condition ( [ 3 ] ) is necessary , though often , with high accuracy , it can be substituted by condition ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we stress : the existence of the superfluous ( oscillatory ) solutions of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) under condition ( [ 3 ] ) is not a reason to ignore this condition .",
    "the point of importance is that just among all solutions of equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) the single solution describing the motion of the particle s proper center of mass can be found .",
    "obviously , it is necessary to know how this solution can be identified among others .    in the focus of this paper is just the initial mathisson equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) .",
    "our purpose is to investigate non - oscillatory solutions describing highly relativistic motions of the spinning particle in a schwarzschild field .",
    "note that the information on all possible types of motions of the spinning test particles in the gravitational fields is important for astrophysics , for more fine investigations of the gravitational collapse and other astrophysical phenomena .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the known integrals of the strict mathisson equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) in a schwarzschild field , the energy and angular momentum , are used in section 2 for reducing the order of differentiation in these equations .",
    "the possible procedure of finding the values of the energy and momentum parameters , which correspond just to the motions of the proper center of mass , is discussed in section 3 .",
    "this procedure is realized in section 4 for the motions close to highly relativistic equatorial circular orbits in a schwarzschild field . in section 5",
    "the illustrations of computer calculation are presented .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "let us consider equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) for schwarzschild s metric in the standard coordinates @xmath14 for the equatorial motions of a spinning particle with spin orthogonal to the motion plane @xmath15 .",
    "then the non - zero components of the metric tensor @xmath16 are : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the schwarzschild mass .",
    "due to the symmetry of schwarzschild s metric equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) have the integrals of the energy @xmath19 and the angular momentum @xmath20 which for the equatorial motions can be written as @xcite @xmath21 @xmath22    for the equatorial motions with spin orthogonal to the motion plane @xmath15 equations ( [ 2 ] ) can be solved separately from ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , taking into account relations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) it is not difficult to obtain from ( [ 2 ] ) all non - zero components @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the known constant of spin @xcite @xmath27 ( we stress that expressions ( [ 10 ] ) satisfy all equations of set ( [ 2 ] ) . )",
    "now we shall consider equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is known that these equations under condition ( [ 3 ] ) contain the second order derivatives @xmath28 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "however , in our case of schwarzschild s metric , due to the integral @xmath19 and @xmath20 , it is possible to reduce the order of differentiation by the standard procedure of the differential equations theory . using ( [ 8])([10 ] ) and the relation @xmath29 after direct calculations ( which are quite simple but rather lengthly ) we get from equation ( [ 1 ] ) the two non - trivial equations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath34^{1/2},\\ ] ] where a dot denote the usual derivatives with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "( two other equations of set ( [ 1 ] ) are satisfied identically . )",
    "so , equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) do not contain the third coordinate derivatives .",
    "however , in these equations the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are present as the parameters which are not determined by the initial values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 only .",
    "( according to ( [ 9 ] ) , for the determination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 the second coordinate derivatives must be given as well . )",
    "that is , equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , as well as the initial mathisson equations ( [ 1 ] ) , describe the motions both of the proper center of mass and the non - proper centers .",
    "in other words , equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) contain the non - oscillatory and oscillatory solutions .",
    "the question of importance is : which values @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond just to the proper center of mass at the arbitrary initial values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 for a spinning test particle ?",
    "it is easy to answer this question when the motion of such a particle is close to the geodesic motion : then approximately @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. , we write the relations for the geodesic motion .",
    "however , we have not any proof that the worldline of a spinning particle is close to the corresponding geodesic worldline for all physically admitted initial values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . on the contrary ,",
    "our results of investigations of the gravitational spin - orbit interaction in a schwarzschild field @xcite show that just highly relativistic motions of a spinning particle must be studied carefully .",
    "therefore , in the next section we shall consider the procedure of choosing the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the proper center of mass for highly relativistic motions .    for further calculations it is convenient to write equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) in terms of the non - dimensional quantities @xmath43 ( in the following we shall put @xmath44 , without any loss in generality . )",
    "then according to equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) we have the set of the first - order differential equations @xmath45 @xmath46^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath47 @xmath48^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 for correct studying the physical conclusions of equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) , it is necessary to take into account the wald condition for a test spinning particle @xcite , therefore we put @xmath52 because in the following we shall compare some solutions of equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) with solutions of the geodesic equations in schwarzschild s metric , it is useful to write here the last equations for the equatorial motions in the coordinates @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 using notation ( [ 14 ] ) we rewrite equations ( [ 21 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) as the set of the first - order differential equations @xmath56 @xmath57 plus two equations which coincide with ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) . equations ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , ( [ 24 ] ) correspondingly are essentially different . as well as equations ( [ 12 ] ) ,",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , the first two equations of set ( [ 15])([18 ] ) contain the constants of the energy and angular momentum of a spinning particle .",
    "according to discussion above , different values of the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 in ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) at the fixed values of @xmath60 correspond to different centers of mass , namely to the single proper center of mass and to the set of non - proper centers .",
    "the right - hand sides of equations ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) are too complicated for investigations in general case .",
    "however , _ a priori _ we can not exclude the possibility to show the essential difference between the motions of the proper and non - proper centers of mass during the short time interval after the beginning of the corresponding motions , namely , when the displacement of the values @xmath61 from their initial values @xmath62 are considered in the linear approximations in the quantities @xmath63 ( in ( [ 27 ] ) we do not write the displacement @xmath64 because the right - hand sides of equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) do not depend on @xmath36 and equation ( [ 18 ] ) is trivial , i.e. , according to ( [ 18 ] ) the value @xmath36 is determined by simple integration of @xmath65 . )",
    "let us check this possibility , i.e. , consider equations ( [ 15])([17 ] ) in the linear in @xmath66 approximation .",
    "then by direct calculations we obtain @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 where the coefficients @xmath72 with the corresponding indexes are expressed through @xmath73 we shall use the expressions of these coefficients in the approximation @xmath74 according to notation ( [ 14 ] ) , relations ( [ 31 ] ) mean that the tangential component of the particle s initial velocity is highly relativistic , and , in addition , that the tangential component is much greater than the radial component .",
    "first , it corresponds with our aim to investigate just highly relativistic motions .",
    "second , because the deviation of a spinning particle is caused by the gravitational spin - orbit interaction , most clearly this deviation can be shown in the case when the tangential velocity is dominant ( in particular , for the circular or closer to the circular orbits @xcite ) .    according to the theory of differential equations , the general solution of linear equations ( [ 28])([30 ] )",
    "is determined by the combination of @xmath75 ( i=1,2,3 ) , where @xmath76 are the solutions of the third - order algebraic equation @xmath77 here the coefficients @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) can be expressed through @xmath72 and depend both on @xmath80 and on the parameters @xmath81 . our task is to find such concrete values @xmath81 which at the fixed @xmath80 determine just the motion of the proper center of mass .",
    "we begin by analyzing the expressions @xmath78 for the simple case when the worldline of a spinning particle is close to the corresponding geodesic worldline .",
    "if the parameter @xmath82 in ( [ 20 ] ) is sufficiently small , for any fixed values @xmath83 the motion of the proper center of mass is close to the geodesic motion",
    ". then we can write approximately @xmath84 ( see expressions ( [ 9 ] ) ) , and according to ( [ 14 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) we have @xmath85 let us consider expressions @xmath78 at @xmath81 from ( [ 41 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that all these expressions have a common feature : all greatest terms with the large value @xmath86 are cancelled .",
    "it means that the corresponding largest terms with @xmath86 are absent in the expressions @xmath87 as well .",
    "so , just the values @xmath81 for the proper center of mass give the minimum values of @xmath87 .",
    "we stress that similar situation takes place for motions of the proper center of mass in the minkowski spacetime : for the proper center @xmath88 ( it corresponds to the straightforward motions ) , and for the non - proper centers @xmath87 are proportional to @xmath89 ( the oscillatory motions ) .",
    "in @xcite we have considered the case of the circular motion of the proper center of mass in a schwarzschild field with @xmath90 . by the notation ( [ 14 ] ) in this case we write @xmath91 for values",
    "( [ 19 ] ) , from ( [ 9 ] ) we obtain @xmath92 let us estimate the values @xmath78",
    ". taking into account ( [ 42 ] ) it is easy to check that , as well as in the previous case , in all expressions @xmath78 the largest terms with @xmath86 are cancelled .",
    "it is naturally to suppose that the similar feature takes place not only in the two partial cases above .",
    "therefore , below we shell check do the criterion of excluding the largest terms with @xmath86 in the expressions @xmath78 can be used for finding the values @xmath58 and @xmath59 which pick out just the motion of the proper center of mass .",
    "as we pointed out in @xcite equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) admit in a schwarzschild field the solutions describing the circular equatorial orbits in the region @xmath94 . by notation (",
    "[ 14 ] ) for these orbits we have @xmath95 the expression @xmath65 from ( [ 43 ] ) is valid beyond the small neighborhood of the value @xmath96 .",
    "( this neighborhood was considered in @xcite . ) at expressions ( [ 43 ] ) , it follows from ( [ 9 ] ) that @xmath97 it is interesting to consider the non - circular orbits which deviate from ( [ 43 ] ) due to @xmath98 under condition ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the expressions @xmath78 in the case @xmath99 where according to ( [ 43 ] ) , ( [ 44 ] ) @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 are some coefficients which do not depend on @xmath82 .",
    "our task is to find such values @xmath102 , @xmath103 which ensure excluding the largest terms with @xmath86 in the expressions @xmath78 .    using @xmath58 , @xmath59 from ( [ 46 ] )",
    "we obtain the conditions under which the largest terms with @xmath86 in the expressions @xmath78 are cancelled : @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 it is easy to check that at the value @xmath107 from ( [ 46 ] ) among three linear in @xmath102 , @xmath103 algebraic equations ( [ 48])([50 ] ) there are only two independent equations",
    ". then the solution of ( [ 48])([50 ] ) is : @xmath108 @xmath109 relations ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ 52 ] ) can be used in computer integration of equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) under conditions ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "graphs of @xmath110 and @xmath111 according to equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) under relations ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ 52 ] ) are shown by the thick lines in figures 1 and 2 correspondingly .",
    "for comparison , the thin lines in the same figures show graphs of @xmath110 and @xmath111 according to geodesic equations ( [ 23])([24 ] ) .",
    "if relations ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ 52 ] ) are violated , computer integration shows the oscillatory solutions .",
    "similar situation takes place for orbits with @xmath112 .",
    "an example of the oscillatory solution is presented in figure 3 .",
    "1 . graph of @xmath110 according to equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) under relations ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ 52 ] ) at @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 determined by ( [ 45 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] ) ( thick line ) .",
    "graph of @xmath110 according to geodesic equations ( [ 23])([24 ] ) at the same @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath116 ( thin line ) .",
    "the horizontal line @xmath119 corresponds to the horizon surface .",
    "2 . graph of @xmath111 in the polar coordinates according to equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) ( thick line ) and ( [ 23])([24 ] ) ( thin line ) .",
    "the values @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath116 are the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "the circle @xmath119 corresponds to the horizon surface .",

    "the computer integration of equations ( [ 15])([18 ] ) at relations ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ 52 ] ) shows that these relations are suitable for choosing solutions , which describe the motions of the proper center of mass . as a result , according to figures 1 and 2 , we conclude that ( under those conditions indicated in the captions at these figures ) the force of the interaction of the particle s spin with the gravitational field acts as the repulsive one . due to this force",
    "the spinning particle falls on the horizon surface during longer time as compared to the corresponding particle without spin ( figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , according to figure 2 , considerable space separation of the corresponding spinning and non - spinning particles takes place within a short time , i.e. , within the time of the particle s fall on the schwarzschild horizon .",
