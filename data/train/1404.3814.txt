    "the study of the _ moduli spaces _ is a traditional research subject in algebraic geometry .",
    "they are schemes or stacks whose points bijectively correspond to fixed kinds of algebro - geometric objects , say curves , sheaves on a fixed variety , etc .",
    "these moduli spaces are interesting not only in algebraic geometry , but also in connection with other research fields such as number theory , differential geometry and string theory . in general",
    "it is not easy to study the geometric properties of the moduli spaces .",
    "instead one tries to construct and study the invariants of the moduli spaces , e.g. their ( weighted ) euler characteristics , virtual poincar or hodge polynomials , integration of the virtual cycles via deformation - obstruction theory .",
    "it has been observed that the best way to study such invariants is taking the generating series . sometimes the generating series defined from the moduli spaces have beautiful forms and properties .",
    "let us observe this phenomenon for some rather amenable examples .",
    "for a quasi - projective variety @xmath0 ( in this article , we always assume that the varieties are defined over @xmath1 ) , the _ hilbert scheme of n - points _ denoted by @xmath2 is the moduli space of zero dimensional subschemes @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "it contains an open subset corresponding to @xmath5-distinct points in @xmath0 , and the geometric structures of its complement is in general complicated .",
    "nevertheless if @xmath0 is non - singular , the generating series of the euler characteristics of @xmath2 have the following beautiful forms  @xcite , @xcite @xmath6 in the case @xmath7 , the torus localization shows that @xmath8 coincides with the number of @xmath9-dimensional partitions of @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting product formulas are consequences of enumerative combinatorics , as in  @xcite .",
    "a general case is reduced to the case @xmath7 .",
    "the study of the invariants of the moduli spaces of curves inside a variety is more important and interesting , because of its connection with _ world sheet counting _ in string theory .",
    "a particularly important case is when @xmath0 is a _ calabi - yau 3-fold _ , i.e. @xmath0 has a trivial canonical line bundle with @xmath10 , as the string theory predicts our universe to be the product of the four dimensional space time with a calabi - yau 3-fold . similarly to @xmath2 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the _ hilbert scheme of curves _ inside @xmath0 , that is the moduli space of projective subschemes @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14=\\beta$ ] and @xmath15 .",
    "the following result was obtained by the author in 2008 , and plays a key role in this article :    [ intro : thm ] let @xmath0 be a smooth projective calabi - yau 3-fold .",
    "then for fixed @xmath16 , the quotient series @xmath17 is the laurent expansion of a rational function of @xmath18 , invariant under @xmath19 .",
    "note that the denominator of ( [ intro : hilb ] ) is given by the formula ( [ hilb0 ] ) .",
    "a typical example of a rational function of @xmath18 invariant under @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "we remark that the invariance of @xmath20 does not say the invariance of the generating series after the formal substitution @xmath22 , but so after taking the analytic continuation of the function ( [ intro : hilb ] ) from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the above result was conjectured in  @xcite as the _ unweighted version _ of the rationality conjecture of rank one donaldson - thomas ( dt ) invariants by maulik - nekrasov - okounkov - pandharipande ( mnop )  @xcite .",
    "the rationality conjecture was proposed in order to formulate the _ gromov - witten / donaldson - thomas correspondence conjecture _ comparing two kinds of curve counting invariants on calabi - yau 3-folds .",
    "the dt invariant was introduced by thomas  @xcite , as a holomorphic analogue of casson invariants of real 3-manifolds .",
    "it counts stable coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau 3-fold , and is a higher dimensional generalization of donaldson invariants on algebraic surfaces . for a calabi - yau 3-fold @xmath0 , an ample divisor @xmath25 on @xmath0 and a cohomology class @xmath26 , the dt invariant @xmath27 is defined to be the degree of the zero dimensional virtual fundamental cycle on the moduli space of @xmath25-stable coherent sheaves @xmath28 on @xmath0 with @xmath29 .",
    "it also coincides with the weighted euler characteristic with respect to the behrend s constructible function on that moduli space  @xcite .",
    "the dt invariants were later generalized by joyce - song  @xcite and kontsevich - soibelman  @xcite so that they also count strictly @xmath25-semistable sheaves .",
    "the generalized dt invariants involve the behrend functions and the motivic hall algebras in the definition , and they are @xmath30-valued .",
    "+ the hilbert scheme of points or curves on a calabi - yau 3-fold is also interpreted as a moduli space of stable sheaves , by assigning a subscheme @xmath12 with its ideal sheaf @xmath31 . the resulting dt invariant is the weighted euler characteristic of the hilbert scheme of points or curves , and in particular it is independent of @xmath25 . in this sense ,",
    "the invariant @xmath32 is the unweighted version of the dt invariant , which coincides with the honest dt invariant up to sign if @xmath11 is non - singular .",
    "the result of theorem  [ intro : thm ] for the weighted version was later proved by bridgeland  @xcite .",
    "the rationality property and the invariance of @xmath20 of the series ( [ intro : hilb ] ) are not visible if we just look at the moduli spaces of curves or points .",
    "such hidden properties of the series ( [ intro : hilb ] ) are visible after we develop new moduli theory and invariants of objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves .      recall that for a variety @xmath0 , the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves @xmath33 is defined to be the localization by quasi - isomorphisms of the homotopy category of the bounded complexes of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 .",
    "the derived category is no longer an abelian category , but has a structure of a triangulated category .",
    "it was originally introduced by grothendieck in 1960 s in order to formulate the relative version of serre duality theorem , known as grothendieck duality theorem .",
    "later it was observed by mukai  @xcite that an abelian variety and its dual abelian variety , which are not necessary isomorphic in general , have the equivalent derived categories of coherent sheaves .",
    "this phenomena suggests that the category @xmath33 has more symmetries than the category of coherent sheaves , as the latter category is known to reconstruct the original variety .",
    "such a phenomena has drawn much attention since kontsevich proposed the _",
    "homological mirror symmetry conjecture _ in  @xcite .",
    "it predicts an equivalence between the derived category of coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau manifold and the derived fukaya category of its mirror manifold , based on an insight that the derived category @xmath33 is a mathematical framework of d - branes of type b in string theory .",
    "there have been several developments in constructing mukai type derived equivalences between non - isomorphic varieties  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and non - trivial autequivalences  @xcite , @xcite , based on the ideas from mirror symmetry .",
    "furthermore such mukai type equivalences have been discovered beyond algebraic geometry .",
    "for instance , derived mckay correspondence  @xcite gives an equivalence between the derived category of finite group representations and the derived category of coherent sheaves on the crepant resolution of the quotient singularity .",
    "this is now interpreted as a special case of equivalences between usual commutative varieties and non - commutative varieties in the context of van den bergh s non - commutative crepant resolutions  @xcite .",
    "there also exists an orlov s equivalence  @xcite between the derived category of coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau hypersurface in the projective space and the category of graded matrix factorizations of the defining equation of it .",
    "this result , called landau - ginzbrug / calabi - yau correspondence , was also motivated by mirror symmetry .",
    "now it is understood that the derived categories have more symmetries than the categories of coherent sheaves .",
    "our point of view is to make the hidden properties of the generating series of dt type invariants visible via symmetries in the derived categories .",
    "the idea of applying derived categories to the study of generating series of dt type invariants suggests an importance of constructing moduli spaces and invariants of objects in the derived categories .",
    "note that in constructing the original dt invariants , we need to fix an ample divisor on a calabi - yau 3-fold @xmath0 , and the associated stability condition on @xmath34 in order to construct a good moduli space of stable sheaves .",
    "the notion of stability conditions on triangulated categories , in particular on derived categories of coherent sheaves , was introduced by bridgeland  @xcite as a mathematical framework of douglas s @xmath35-stability  @xcite in string theory . for a triangulated category @xmath36 , a bridgeland stability condition on it roughly consists of data @xmath37 for a group homomorphism",
    "@xmath38 called the _ central charge _ , and the collection of subcategories @xmath39 for @xmath40 whose objects are called @xmath41__-semistable objects with phase _",
    "_ @xmath42 .",
    "the main result by bridgeland  @xcite is to show that the set of ` good ' stability conditions on @xmath36 forms a complex manifold .",
    "this complex manifold is in particular important when @xmath43 for a calabi - yau manifold @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", the space of stability conditions @xmath44 is expected to contain the universal covering space of the moduli space of complex structures of a mirror manifold of @xmath0 .",
    "so far the space @xmath44 has been studied in several situations , e.g. @xmath0 is a curve  @xcite , @xcite , @xmath0 is a k3 surface  @xcite , @xmath0 is a some non - compact calabi - yau 3-fold  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been a serious issue in studying bridgeland stability conditions on projective calabi - yau 3-folds which are likely to be the most important case : we are not able to prove the existence of bridgeland stability conditions on smooth projective calabi - yau 3-folds . in  @xcite",
    ", the existence problem is reduced to showing a conjectural bogomolov - gieseker type inequality evaluating the third chern character of certain two term complexes of coherent sheaves .",
    "however proving that inequality conjecture seems to require a new idea .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth projective calabi - yau 3-fold .",
    "we expect that , for a given @xmath45 and @xmath26 , there exists the dt type invariant @xmath46 which counts @xmath41-semistable objects @xmath47 with @xmath29 .",
    "as we mentioned , there is a serious issue in constructing a bridgeland stability condition on projective calabi - yau 3-folds , but let us ignore this for a while . for an ample divisor @xmath25 on @xmath0 , we expect that the classical @xmath25-stability appears as a certain special limiting point in @xmath44 called the _",
    "large volume limit_. if we take @xmath45 near the large volume limit point , then we expect the equality @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that there is an autequivalence @xmath49 of @xmath33 and @xmath50 so that the equality @xmath51 holds for any @xmath52 .",
    "then the generating series of the invariants @xmath53 is preserved by the variable change induced by @xmath54 .",
    "if we are able to relate @xmath55 and @xmath53 , then it would imply the hidden symmetry of the generating series of classical dt invariants @xmath56 with respect @xmath54 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath55 and @xmath53 is studied by the wall - crossing phenomena : there should be a wall and chamber structure on the space @xmath44 so that the invariants @xmath57 are constant on a chamber but jumps if @xmath58 crosses a wall .",
    "the wall - crossing formula of the invariants @xmath57 should be described by a general framework established by joyce - song  @xcite , kontsevich - soibelman  @xcite , using stack theoretic hall algebras .",
    "+ however as we mentioned , we are not able to prove @xmath59 , so the above story is the next stage after proving the non - emptiness .",
    "the idea of proving theorem  [ intro : thm ] was to introduce ` weak ' bridgeland stability conditions on triangulated categories , and apply the above story for the space of weak stability conditions on the subcategory of @xmath33 generated by @xmath60 and one or zero dimensional sheaves .",
    "the latter subcategory is called the category of _ d0-d2-d6 bound states_. the notion of weak stability conditions is a kind of limiting degenerations of bridgeland stability conditions , and it is a coarse version of bayer s polynomial stability conditions  @xcite , the author s limit stability conditions  @xcite .",
    "it is easier to construct weak stability conditions and enough to prove theorem  [ intro : thm ] applying the above story .",
    "the derived dual @xmath61 , an autequivalence of @xmath33 , turned out to be responsible for the hidden symmetric property of @xmath20 of the series ( [ intro : hilb ] ) in the above story .",
    "+ the idea of proving theorem  [ intro : thm ] has turned out to be useful in proving several other interesting properties of dt type invariants , say dt / pt correspondence  @xcite , @xcite conjectured by pandharipande - thomas  @xcite . we refer to  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for other works relating the above story .      in section  [ sec : dt ] , we review and survey recent developments of donaldson - thomas theory . in section  [ sec : br ] , we survey the developments on bridgeland stability conditions . in section  [ sec : con ] , we discuss open problems on dt theory and bridgeland stability conditions .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth projective variety and @xmath25 an ample divisor on @xmath0 . for an object @xmath62 , its hilbert polynomial is given by @xmath63 for @xmath64 by the riemann - roch theorem .",
    "here @xmath65 and @xmath9 is the dimension of the support of @xmath28 .",
    "the reduced hilbert polynomial @xmath66 is defined to be @xmath67 .",
    "an object @xmath62 is @xmath25__-(semi)stable _ _ if for any subsheaf @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 and the inequality @xmath70 holds for @xmath71 .    note that if @xmath28 is torsion free , then @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is some constant .",
    "hence the @xmath25-(semi)stability is the refinement of @xmath25-slope ( semi)stability defined by the slope function @xmath76 .",
