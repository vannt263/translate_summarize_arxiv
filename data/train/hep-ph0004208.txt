    "the conceptual development of very intense muon sources  @xcite has led to a proposal  @xcite to use this new accelerator technology to build a neutrino factory in which an intense low energy muon beam is rapidly accelerated and injected into a storage ring with long straight sections .",
    "the muons decaying in these straight sections produce intense beams of highly collimated neutrinos .",
    "the technical and physics possibilities for building and using neutrino factories have been explored by many groups  @xcite .",
    "the interest in neutrino factories is primarily driven by recent measurements from the superkamiokande ( superk ) collaboration  @xcite , which indicate that muon neutrinos produced in atmospheric interactions of cosmic rays oscillate into other neutrino flavors , a result that is consistent with measurements made in other experiments  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a well - defined electron neutrino flux in the muon storage ring neutrino beams permits one to explore the effect of matter on the propagation of electron neutrinos .",
    "the analysis of the oscillation data leads to several scenarios of neutrino masses and mixing . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of passage through matter on neutrino oscillations .",
    "we specifically consider the large angle msw scenario ( lma )  @xcite , which , as defined in the recent fermilab six month physics study  @xcite , has @xmath15 and the cp violating phase @xmath16 .",
    "however , to the extent that the contributions from the subleading solar @xmath17 scale are small , our results apply approximately to other solar scenarios .",

    "the average density is typically of order 3  gm / cm@xmath14 and @xmath30 .",
    "the oscillation probability @xmath31 is directly proportional to @xmath32 , which is approximately proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "there is a resonant enhancement for @xmath34 for electron neutrinos , @xmath24 is positive and the resonance enhancement occurs for positive values of @xmath9 for @xmath35 .",
    "the reverse is true for electron anti - neutrinos and the enhancement occurs for negative values of @xmath9 .",
    "thus for a neutrino factory operating with positive stored muons ( producing a @xmath36 beam ) one expects an enhanced production of opposite sign ( @xmath3 ) charged - current events as a result of the oscillation @xmath37 if @xmath9 is positive and vice versa for stored negative beams  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is evident in fig .",

    "this figure shows that for larger @xmath41 the ratio of wrong - sign muon events is sensitive to the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath9 is determined from the disappearance of muon neutrinos due to the oscillation @xmath42 , since it can be shown that for the baselines under consideration here , the matter effects are small in this channel ( see fig .  2 , curves 2 and 3 of ref .",
    "the oscillation probability@xmath43 can thus be approximated by @xmath44 as though it were in vacuum for baselines as far as 4000  km .",
    "( see the section  method \" for a correction to this approximation for matter effects for longer baselines . )",
    "in order to extract both the sign and magnitude of @xmath9 , we simultaneously fit four channels ( i ) @xmath1 ( ii ) @xmath45 ( iii ) @xmath46 ( iv ) @xmath47 .",
    "the first two channels are measured when n @xmath3 decays occur in the storage ring and the second two channels are observed when n @xmath6 decays occur  @xcite .",
    "we study the extraction of oscillation parameters in two scenarios :    * a muon storage ring with @xmath48 muon decays and a 50 kiloton detector . *",
    "a muon storage ring with @xmath49 muon decays and a 50 kiloton detector .",
    "a 20  gev version of this is known as an `` entry level '' neutrino factory .",
    "our study is performed for baselines ranging from 732  km up to 7332  km and stored muon energies ranging from 20  gev to 50  gev .",
    "we calculate the neutrino event rates by propagating the neutrinos through matter , taking into account the variations in the density profile using the preliminary reference earth model  @xcite by solving the evolution equations numerically .",
    "realistic detector resolutions are used that are appropriate for a magnetized iron scintillator detector  @xcite .",
    "we assume a muon energy resolution @xmath50 and a hadronic shower resolution of @xmath51 for showers of energy @xmath52  gev and 0.8/@xmath53 for showers of energy @xmath54  gev .",

    "figure [ fig : hists ] shows the wrong - sign muon appearance spectra with these cuts as function of @xmath9 for both @xmath6 and @xmath3 beams for both signs of @xmath9 at a baseline of 2800  km .",
    "the resonance enhancement in wrong sign muon production is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hists ] ( b ) and ( c ) . using these histograms and similar ones for the disappearance channels , it is possible to predict the spectrum in any channel for any value of @xmath9 in the range of interest by polynomial interpolation of the histograms bin by bin with the method of divided differences . for the interpolation ,",
    "the disappearance probabilities can be treated to first order as though they are due to vacuum oscillations ( i.e. matter effects can be neglected ) and are proportional to @xmath55 . for the longer baselines , the matter effects affect these disappearance rates slightly , as can be seen from fig .  3 of ref .",
    "the difference in the disappearance rates for positive and negative @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath33 , vanishing as @xmath56 . for the channel @xmath57 , the positive @xmath9 solution approaches the negative @xmath9 solution as @xmath58 , the reverse being the case for anti - neutrinos .",
    "we use this behavior to interpolate the disappearance spectra as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the event rates in both the appearance and disappearance channels depend only on the three vacuum parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath9 . using this interpolation scheme",
    ", we can generate events for any combination of these parameters for various muon momenta and baselines .",
    "most of the information on the sign of @xmath9 comes from the appearance channels and the precision on the magnitude of @xmath9 comes from the disappearance channels  @xcite .",
    "the background for the wrong - sign muon appearance channels arise from three sources : ( i )  charm production , ( ii )  @xmath61 decay events producing wrong sign muons in neutral current interactions , and ( iii )  @xmath61 decay events producing wrong sign muons in charged - current ( cc ) events where the primary muon was considered lost  @xcite . a more detailed study of the backgrounds  @xcite has shown that significant reductions are obtained by demanding that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is defined as the transverse - momentum - squared of the muon with respect to the hadronic shower direction .",
    "imposing this cut results in a further signal efficiency factor of @xmath64  @xcite for the cc disappearance channels , @xmath65 for the @xmath6 beam appearance signal and @xmath66 for the @xmath3 beam appearance signal .",
    "this results in an average background/@xmath1 cc signal rate of @xmath67 for @xmath6 beam appearance channel and @xmath68 for the @xmath3 beam appearance channel .",
    "the difference in these rates between the @xmath6 and @xmath3 beams is due to the different kinematical distributions of the neutrino and anti - neutrino cc interactions .",
    "we fold these rates into the theoretical prediction for each channel .",
    "we also assume a normalization systematic uncertainty of 1@xmath69 between the @xmath6 beam and @xmath3 beam events .",
    "table  [ dm2table ] lists the wrong sign muon appearance and background  rates for an `` entry level '' machine .",
    "event rates for the appearance channels are appreciable , whereas background rates are negligible for baselines longer than about 2800  km .",

    "this value of @xmath7 we define as the 3@xmath75 reach in @xmath7 space .",
