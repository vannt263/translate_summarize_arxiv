    "charge transport in nanostructures is a major research area , both theoretically and experimentally . apart from the average current flowing through a structure in response to an applied external field , fluctuations and correlations in time of this current are of interest . by studying the current noise power spectral density ( psd ) ,",
    "information about the charge transport process can be extracted that may not be accessible through studies of the average current alone.@xcite an example of this is shot noise , arising due to the discreteness of the charge carriers , ( electrons ) .",
    "@xcite    in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems )  @xcite , mechanical degrees of freedom affect and/or are affected by charge transport through the device .",
    "one such system is the single electron shuttle system  @xcite , also known as the nanoelectromechanical single electron transistor ( nem - set ) .",
    "the system consists of a metallic grain embedded in an elastic material between two bulk leads , forming a mechanically soft coulomb blockade double junction .",
    "since current through the system is accompanied by charging of the grain , interplay between the coulomb forces and the mechanical degrees of freedom can lead to self - oscillations of the grain , which in turn , supports charge transport through shuttling of electrons between the leads .",
    "much work , both experimental  @xcite as well as theoretical  @xcite has been reported in this field .    in this paper , the noise spectrum of the single - electron shuttle",
    "is studied in the limit of weak electromechanical coupling .",
    "it is found that the onset of mechanical vibrations is accompanied by a peak in the low frequency psd .",
    "hence , by measuring the noise , it can be determined whether or not the grain is oscillating .",
    "this is an important result since direct detection of any high frequency mechanical motion is problematic with present day experimental techniques .",
    "a schematic picture of the system is shown in .",
    "a metallic grain of mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 is placed between two leads , separated by a distance @xmath4 , via elastic , insulating materials .",
    "when a bias voltage @xmath5 is applied between the leads , electron transport occur by sequential , incoherent , tunneling between the leads and the grain .",
    "the system can also lower its electrostatic energy by altering the grain position @xmath6 .",
    "the electron transport in the system is described using the notion of the equivalent circuit of characterized by resistances and capacitances @xmath7 and @xmath8 which both depend on the grain position @xmath6 : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the characteristic length scale for tunneling and @xmath11 are the capacitances of the left and right junctions when the grain is at @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 are typical capacitance length scales for the left and right tunnel junction respectively . the grain self - capacitance @xmath14 is also included in the model .",
    "if @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , tunneling is well described by the `` orthodox '' theory of coulomb blockade  @xcite and the tunneling rates through the left(right ) junction is @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the inverse temperature and @xmath19 is the decrease of free energy as the event @xmath20 occurs .",
    "the charges @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the charges accumulated on the left and right leads and the excess charge on the grain .",
    "the free energy decrease @xmath23 can be expressed using the equivalent circuit model of .    considering the grain motion to be classical and one dimensional we have newton s equation @xmath24 for the grain displacement .",
    "the external force @xmath25 acting on the grain includes an elastic force @xmath26 , a dissipative force @xmath27 , an electric force @xmath28 and a vdw force @xmath29 yielding the equation of motion @xmath30 for the elastic force we use a phenomenological non - linear potential  @xcite acting as a harmonic well with spring force constant @xmath31 for small displacements but that diverges as a lennard - jones potential ( 12th power ) at the positions @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 the dissipative force is modelled as a viscous damping term @xmath36 and the electrostatic force is given by @xmath37 where @xmath22 and @xmath38 can be calculated from the equivalent circuit of .",
    "finally , the van der waals force between the grain and the leads is derived from a lennard - jones interaction potential for the individual atoms  @xcite in the leads and the grain respectively . for a geometry with a metallic sphere close to a flat substrate one",
    "finds , @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the hamaker constants for the attractive and repulsive parts of the force .",
    "equation ( [ eq : newton ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "in this section we will briefly describe the current noise - spectrum of the model system presented in the previous section . defining the current @xmath41 through the system as the charge transferred per unit time from the grain to the right lead ,",
    "the psd is given by @xmath42 where the brackets denotes ensemble averaging .",
    "@xcite by doing direct numerical integration , _",
    "i.e. _ solving the stochastic differential equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton ] ) , the current as a function of time is obtained and the noise spectrum calculated . a representative result of such a calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "this spectrum was calculated for a system in the shuttle regime .",
    "the psd has been normalized to obtain the fano factor @xmath43    we have divided the spectrum in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] into four regions marked * i*-*iv*. at high frequencies , region * iv * , the fano factor is close to a value of 1/2 which is the value for a static double junction  @xcite . in region * iii * two strong peaks are located at the vibration frequency and the first harmonic . this is a result of the periodic charging and decharging of the oscillating grain .",
    "the large magnitude of the first harmonic stems from the fact that charge exchange between the grain and the left lead gives rise to a displacement current in the right lead where we measure @xmath41 . directly below the peaks , region * ii * , the noise is suppressed below the shot noise level of a static double junction , possibly due to the additional in time correlations between successive tunnel events induced by the oscillating grain .",
    "the most interesting part of the spectrum however , is the low frequency part in region  * i * , where the fano factor increases .",
    "this enhancement of the noise is associated with fluctuations in mechanical energy . in the next section we present an analytical treatment of a simplified model system which does not take into account non - linear elastic forces , vdw forces or position dependent capacitances .",
    "nevertheless , this model suffices to explain the low frequency behavior of the noise spectrum in the shuttle regime as well as to predict a ( quasi ) singular behavior of the fano factor at the instability threshold .",
    "the system is completely described by the conditional probability densities @xmath44 to find the system with charge @xmath22 at time @xmath45 in the interval @xmath46 given it was located around @xmath47 at time @xmath48 .",
    "the time evolution of the conditional probability density , as well as the unconditional probability density @xmath49 , is given by the phase space equation @xmath50 here a simplified version of the external force @xmath51 where @xmath52 has been used . introducing action - angle variables @xmath53",

    "they correspond to a nanometer sized au grain commonly used in experiments with self - assembled coulomb blockade double junctions .",
    "although , as explained in  @xcite , the non - parabolic confining potential smoothens any step - structure in the current - voltage characteristics , the transition between static- and shuttle - operation is clearly visible in the noise spectrum . below the threshold voltage",

    "( [ eq : rates]-[eq : newton ] ) the psd of the classical single electron shuttle has been studied in the case of weak electromechanical coupling .",
    "we have focussed on the low frequency part of the spectrum , which is the part most susceptible to direct measurements , and found that the shuttle regime can be distinguished from the stationary regime by the noise level at low frequencies .",
    "in particular , the shuttle regime is associated with a rise in the low frequency psd , as compared to a stationary coulomb blockade double junction , resulting in an increased fano factor .",
    "this increase is due to slow variations in the current arising from variations in oscillation amplitude .",
    "approaching the point of the transition from above ( lowering the bias voltage when in the shuttle regime ) the noise level shows a ( quasi ) divergent behavior upon closing in on the transition . hence , even though a measurement of the average current alone may not reveal whether the system is in the shuttle regime or not , the accompanying noise signature can provide this information .",
