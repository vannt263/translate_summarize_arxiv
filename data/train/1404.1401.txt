    "the one - particle dirac equation plays a fundamental role in relativistic quantum theory .",
    "it was introduced by dirac to describe the dynamics of spin 1/2 fermions such as electrons .",
    "although as a one - particle equation alone its physical interpretation is difficult due to the occurrence of negative energy states , its second - quantized form leads to the so - called _ external field _ or _ no - photon quantum electrodynamics_. in this respect , our interest in the solution theory for initial data on space - like hypersurfaces is three - fold :    1 .",
    "while a mathematical rigorous construction of the second - quantized time evolution in a fixed fermionic fock space has only been carried out successfully in the case of zero space - like components of the external four - vector potential , physicists have developed powerful recipes to extract predictions in terms of formal perturbation series from external field quantum electrodynamics despite the ill - defined nature of its equations of motion ; e.g. , see @xcite for an overview . whether the resulting series do converge or in which regimes the corresponding corrections are small seems to be unknown",
    "this fact becomes particular unsatisfactory in light of next generation laser experiments such as planned to be conducted , e.g. , at the extreme light infrastructure @xcite .",
    "these will allow to probe quantum electrodynamics in strong - field regimes in which , first , the conventional perturbative techniques become questionable , and second , a mere scattering theoretic description of physical processes is not sufficient and a dynamical description is needed ; cf .",
    "+ the obstacle in the construction of a second - quantized time evolution was observed in the works @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the one - particle time evolution can be lifted to the fock space if and only if the space - like components of the external four - vector potential are zero .",
    "one way out of this dilemma , as sketched in @xcite , is to implement the time evolution on time - varying fock spaces .",
    "two different such constructions have been carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both involve additional degrees of freedom ( such as the charge - renormalization ) which can be encoded in the choice of a phase depending on the external field ; see @xcite for the identification of the dependence of these degrees of freedom on the external field .",
    "the resulting second - quantized time evolution transports initial data from one equal - time hyperplane to another and gives rise to unique transition probabilities .",
    "however , quantities such as the charge - current density depend manifestly on this unidentified phase . in particular , this concerns the so - called phenomenon of _ vacuum polarization _ but also the dynamical description of pair creation processes for which so far only a few rigorous treatments are available ; see @xcite for vacuum polarization in the hartree - fock approximation for static external sources and @xcite for adiabatic pair creation .",
    "the involved degrees of freedom can be reduced further by imposing the bogolyubov causality condition ( * ? ? ? * ( 17.30 ) ) or more or less equivalently by implementing second - quantized evolution maps between fock spaces associated to space - like cauchy hypersurfaces , which is the content of a follow - up work . during our study of the latter approach a detailed knowledge of the one - particle dirac equation for initial data on space - like hypersurfaces proved to be essential . collecting",
    "this knowledge is our main motivation for writing this paper . + another possible way out of the mentioned dilemma that deserves mentioning lies in a reformulation of quantum electrodynamics in terms of the so - called _ fermionic projector _ for which we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "apart from this we have two more general interests :    1 .   as well as",
    "classical electrodynamics also quantum electrodynamics is a manifestly lorentz covariant theory .",
    "however , its lorentz covariance is often obscured in the presentation of the theory when its fundamental equations of motion are formulated exclusively on equal - time hyperplanes .",
    "non - trivial lorentz boosts , however , tilt any equal - time hyperplane in space - time and , therefore , lorentz covariance of quantum electrodynamics is only apparent in the momentum representation of the free theory or in the asymptotic description of the corresponding scattering theory . in order to make lorentz and gauge covariance explicit in a space - time representation we provide necessary mathematical results for the dirac equation that allow to work exclusively with initial data on space - like cauchy hypersurfaces in the spirit of tomonaga and schwinger @xcite . in this regard our efforts",
    "are intended to contribute towards a mathematically rigorous understanding of their works .",
    "2 .   furthermore , by deforming a cauchy surface in a small neighborhood of a point , the dynamics can be studied locally ; compare the differential formulation of the equations of motion ( 25 ) in @xcite . providing mathematical tools for such",
    "a study is our third motivation for this paper .",
    "one important observation is that due to the causal structure of solutions of the dirac equation only local information about the external potential is needed . in consequence ,",
    "the behavior of the external potential and of the cauchy surfaces near `` infinity '' is irrelevant for finite times .",
    "this justifies the technical convenience of restricting our study to compactly supported external potentials .",
    "there are several treatises of the dirac equation in the classical literature which discuss the dirac equation on equal - time hyperplanes , most prominently @xcite .",
    "the initial value problems for such hyperbolic systems of differential equations was already treated in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "wave equations on lorentzian manifolds including the dirac equation have been studied , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "their results ensure existence and uniqueness of solutions and identify their causal structure .",
    "the main contribution of our work is the introduction of general fourier transform and corresponding paley - wiener techniques that can be exploited in flat space - time to study solutions to the one - particle dirac equation on cauchy surfaces .",
    "a byproduct of these generalized fourier transform methods yields yet another proof for the well - posedness of the initial value problem of dirac equation on cauchy surfaces .",
    "therefore we used this opportunity to compile our results in the form of a self - contained review given in section  [ sec : review ] that ranges from general assertions about the initial value problem to a detailed analysis of solutions . to increase readability",
