    "the dirac equation for relativistic electrons , in spite of its fundamental importance in physics , is far from being thoroughly understood  @xcite .",
    "one of its special features is that , even in the absence of fields , there exists a spectrum of positive and negative electron energies .",
    "this peculiarity is a source of various problems .",
    "one of them is a phenomenon of zitterbewegung ( trembling motion ) which arises from an interference of positive and negative energy states @xcite .",
    "there exist attempts to circumvent this duality .",
    "one of them is the foldy and wouthuysen transformation ( fwt ) which , for the case of no external fields , allows one to break the dirac equation into separate equations for positive and negative energies  @xcite . in their original paper ,",
    "fw remarked that a functional kernel , which transforms functions from the original representation to the fw representation , is characterized by a non - locality in coordinate space of the order of the compton wavelength @xmath0",
    ". rose in his book  @xcite put this statement on a quantitative basis by showing that the second moment of the kernel is equal to @xmath1 ( see below ) .",
    "this result was not followed by other investigations and it is by now not well known .",
    "also , the moments are often used in statistical physics but they are a rather unorthodox way to characterize quantum mechanical properties .",
    "it was shown later that the fw transformation is not unique .",
    "in other words , there exist other transformations capable of separating positive and negative energy states in the dirac equation , both in the absence of fields and in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite . in the following we consider , in addition to the fwt , a two - step transformation proposed by moss and okninski ( mo , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us consider , as a matter of example , an average value of the time - dependent velocity operator  @xmath2 in the heisenberg picture , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the dirac hamiltonian and  @xmath6 is an arbitrary dirac spinor .",
    "according to the dirac equation one has @xmath7 , where  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the standard dirac  @xmath10 matrices .",
    "as is well known ,  @xmath8 do not commute with  @xmath5 , so the velocity depends on time also in the absence of fields , which results in the zitterbewegung mentioned above .",
    "the operator  @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ iv(t ) ] ) stands for a unitary transformation , for example the fwt .",
    "equation  ( [ iv(t ) ] ) expresses the well known fact that a unitary transformation does not change an average value . in our case",
    "it means that a transformation will not eliminate the zitterbewegung , which makes physical sense .",
    "we wrote down eq .",
    "( [ iv(t ) ] ) to illustrate symbolically that , if one transforms the operators : @xmath12 , one should also transform the functions : @xmath13 .",
    "important operators transformed according to fwt are given in the original fw paper and quoted in many textbooks . here , we concentrate on the transformed functions which were not analyzed in the literature .",
    "our work has two objectives .",
    "the first is to characterize in various ways the non - locality of the foldy - wouthuysen transformation for the dirac equation . in doing this",
    "we continue the work of rose but use means more typical for quantum mechanics .",
    "the second objective is to investigate , as a matter of example , another  separating `` transformation and to compare its properties to those of fwt .",
    "such a comparison should give an idea of what one can expect of various ' ' separating  transformations .",
    "our subject is of relevance for two reasons .",
    "first , with  the rise of graphene `` there is nowadays a great deal of interest in relativistic - type wave equations  @xcite .",
    "second , it is now possible to simulate the dirac equation with the trapped ions and cold atoms interacting with the laser radiation , where one can tailor much more ' ' user friendly `` values of the basic parameters  @xmath14 and  @xmath15  @xcite . in fact , a proof - of - principle experiment simulating 1 + 1 dirac equation and the resulting zitterbewegung was carried out by gerritsma _",
    "et al . _",
    "if one deals with effective parameters by employing narrow - gap semiconductors , the non - locality is determined by an ' ' effective `` compton wavelength  @xmath16 , where  @xmath17 is the effective electron mass and  @xmath18 is the maximum electron velocity . in narrow - gap semiconductors",
    "one can deal with @xmath19 and @xmath20 cm / s , so that the non - locality can be a few orders of magnitude larger than that in a vacuum , see ref .",
    "the band structure of graphene corresponds to the ' ' ultra - relativistic  case ( no gap ) and a similar maximum velocity  @xmath18 , so the non - locality may be even larger .",
    "in this section we establish forms of foldy - wouthuysen and moss - okninski transformations and define corresponding transformation kernels .",
    "next we characterize nonlocal properties of the kernels by calculating their moments .",
    "the dirac equation for a free relativistic electron is @xmath21 , where  @xmath22 is the momentum and  @xmath23 and  @xmath24 are  @xmath10 dirac matrices in the standard notation .",
    "the eigenenergies are  @xmath25 with @xmath26 .    for the field - free case",
    "the momentum components are good quantum numbers @xmath27 . in the fw transformation an initial function  @xmath6",
    "is transformed to the new representation  @xmath28 with the use of the operator @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 there is @xmath31 . to find the mo transformation , we follow moss and okninski  @xcite and introduce first the unitary operator @xmath32 which transforms the dirac equation to the form @xmath33 , in which @xmath34 the hamiltonian  @xmath35 has zeroes on the diagonal . for a four - component function  @xmath36 there is @xmath37 . the two - step mo transformation is defined using the  @xmath35 hamiltonian in the following way @xmath38    in the field - free case the operators  @xmath29 and  @xmath39 are number matrices . following foldy and wouthuysen",
    "we introduce a function transformation from the old to the new representation @xmath40 . inserting the unity operators we obtain @xmath41 which defines the transformation kernel @xmath42 in eqs .",
    "( [ uk_phi ] ) and  ( [ uk_k ] )  @xmath11 stands for each of the two operators defined above and @xmath43",
    ". the kernels are  @xmath10 matrices .",
    "as mentioned above , the transformation kernels have a nonlocal character .",
    "we also remarked that rose  @xcite described this feature quantitatively by calculating the second moment of the fw kernel and showing that its smearing is given by the compton wavelength  @xmath44 .",
    "below we evoke his calculations , as it is not easily accessible by now , and compare his result with the corresponding quantities for the mo transformation .",
    "the moments are rarely used to describe quantum mechanical behavior , for this reason we do not limit our subsequent considerations to the moments but also consider other quantities .    all the elements of matrices defined in eq .",
    "( [ uk_k ] ) are nonlocal functions of @xmath45 . to estimate the non - locality we calculate the zeroth and second moments  @xmath46 of  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 matrices @xmath49 let us consider first the  @xmath50 element of  @xmath47 .",
    "for the zeroth moment there is @xmath51 changing the order of integration one has @xmath52 .",
    "then the integration over  @xmath53 is trivial and one obtains  @xmath54 .",
    "the second moment of the  @xmath50 element is @xmath55 integrating twice by parts one obtains @xmath56           d^3{\\bm p } \\nonumber \\\\        & = & -\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2 \\left . \\left",

    "we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where  @xmath59 is the identity matrix .",
    "these are the results of rose  @xcite .",
    "thus the  @xmath60 kernel is smeared in the @xmath61 space by the amount of  @xmath62 in each direction .",
    "the kernel can be considered to be a transformed dirac delta function , cf .",
    "( [ uk_phi ] ) .",
    "hence , one can subscribe to the statement of foldy and wouthuysen that `` a wave function which in the old representation corresponds to a state in which the particle was localized at one point , passes over in the new representation into a wave function which corresponds to the particle being spread out over a finite region '' .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we carry similar calculations for the moss - okninski transformation and calculate the zeroth moment of the  @xmath63 element of  @xmath39 @xmath64 for the second moment of  @xmath63 element of  @xmath39 we integrate twice by parts and obtain @xmath65           d^3{\\bm p } \\nonumber \\\\        & = & -\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2 \\left .",
