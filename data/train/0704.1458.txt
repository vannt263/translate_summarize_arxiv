    "most galaxies with massive spheroidal components appear to harbor central black holes ( bhs ) , with masses ranging from a few @xmath4 to over @xmath5 .",
    "these bh masses are well correlated with both the luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the galaxy spheroid @xcite , implying that the formation of the central bhs is connected intimately with the development of the galaxy bulges . however , a bulge is not necessarily a prerequisite for a massive bh . on the one hand , neither the late - type spiral galaxy m33 ( gebhardt et al . 2001 ) nor the dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc 205 ( valluri et al . 2005 ) shows dynamical evidence for a massive bh . on the other hand ,",
    "both the sd spiral galaxy ngc 4395 and the dwarf spheroidal galaxy pox 52 contain active bhs with masses @xmath6 , although neither contains a classic bulge ( fillipenko & ho 2003 ; barth et al .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 , 2007 ) find that optically active intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs , @xmath7 ) , while rare , do exist in dwarf galaxies , but optical searches are heavily biased toward sources accreting at high eddington rates .",
    "alternate search techniques are needed to probe the full demographics of imbhs .",
    "direct dynamical detection of imbhs is currently impossible outside of the local group .",
    "however , gebhardt , rich , & ho ( 2002 , 2005 ) have found dynamical evidence for an excess dark mass of @xmath8 at the center of the globular cluster g1 in m31 ; the evidence for this imbh was questioned by @xcite , but supported by the improved data and analysis of gebhardt et al .",
    "the physical nature of the central dark object is difficult to prove : it could be either an imbh or a cluster of stellar remnants . while the putative presence of a bh in a globular cluster center may appear unrelated to galaxy bulges",
    ", the properties of g1 , including its large mass , high degree of rotational support , and multi - aged stellar populations , all suggest that g1 is actually the nucleus of a stripped dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "most intriguingly , the inferred bh mass for g1 is about 0.1% of the total mass , consistent with the relation seen for higher mass bhs , and consistent with predictions based on mergers of bhs @xcite or stellar mergers in dense clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported an x - ray detection of g1 , with a 0.210  kev luminosity of @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "although this may represent accretion onto a central bh , it is within the range expected for either accretion onto an imbh or for a massive x - ray binary .",
    "unfortunately , the most accurate x - ray position determined recently by @xcite does not have sufficient accuracy to determine whether the x - ray source is located within the central core of g1 , which would help distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the radio / x - ray ratio of g1 provides an additional test of the nature of the g1 x - ray source . as pointed out by @xcite and maccarone , fender , & tzioumis ( 2005 )",
    ", deep radio searches may be a very effective way to detect imbhs in globular clusters and related objects , since , for a given x - ray luminosity , stellar mass bhs produce far less radio luminosity than supermassive bhs .",
    "the relation between bh mass , and x - ray and radio luminosity empirically appears to follow a `` fundamental plane , '' in which the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity increases as the @xmath10 power of the bh mass ( merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding , & markoff 2004 ) . for an imbh mass of @xmath11 in g1 , one",
    "thus would expect a radio / x - ray ratio about 400 times higher than for a @xmath12 stellar bh . in this paper ,",
    "we report a deep very large array ( vla ) integration on g1 and a radio detection that apparently confirms the presence of an imbh whose mass is consistent with that found by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "we obtained a 20-hr observation of g1 using the vla in its c configuration ( maximum baseline length of 3.5  km ) at 8.46 ghz .",
    "the observation was split into two 10-hr sessions , one each on 2006 november 24/25 and 2006",
    "november 25/26 .",
    "each day s observation consisted of repeated cycles of 1.4 minutes observation on the local phase calibrator j0038 + 4137 and 6 minutes observation on the target source g1 .",
    "in addition , each day contained two short observations of 3c  48 ( j0137 + 3309 ) that were used to calibrate the flux density scale to that of @xcite .",
    "thus , the total integration time on g1 was 14.1 hr . we also obtained a total of 9.5 hr of observing in c configuration at 4.86  ghz on 2007 january 13/14 and 2007 january 14/15 , using a similar observing strategy , and achieving a total of 7.3 hr of integration on source .    all data calibration was carried out in nrao s astronomical image processing system @xcite .",
    "absolute antenna gains were determined by the 3c  48 observations , then transferred to j0038 + 4137 , which was found to have respective flux densities of 0.52  mjy and 0.53  mjy at 8.4 and 4.9  ghz . in turn , j0038 + 4137 was used to calibrate the interferometer amplitudes and phases for the target source , g1 .",
    "erroneous data were flagged by using consistency of the gain solutions as a guide and by discarding outlying amplitude points .",
    "the vla presently is being replaced gradually by the expanded vla ( evla ) , which includes complete replacement of virtually all the electronic systems on the telescopes . since antennas are refurbished one at a time , the vla at the time of our observations consisted of 1820 `` old '' vla antennas and 6 `` new '' ( actually , refurbished ) evla antennas , having completely different electronics systems .",
    "although all antennas were cross - correlated for our observations , we found subtle errors in some of the evla data .",
    "thus , to be conservative , we discarded the data from all evla antennas except for 3 antennas that were confirmed to work very well on 2006",
    "november 24/25 .    the radio data were fourier transformed and total - intensity images were produced in each band , covering areas of 17@xmath1317  at each frequency .",
    "these images were cleaned in order to produce the final images . at 8.4  ghz ,",
    "the rms noise was 6.2  @xmath14jy  beam@xmath2 for a beam size of 294@xmath13272 ; at 4.9  ghz , the noise was 15.0  @xmath14jy  beam@xmath2 for a beam size of 509@xmath13443 .",
    "a few radio sources with strengths of hundreds of microjansky to a few millijansky were found in the images , but we discuss only g1 in this _",
    "letter_. at 8.4  ghz , an apparent source with a flux density of @xmath15  @xmath14jy [ corresponding to @xmath1  w  hz@xmath2 for distance modulus of @xmath16  mag ( meylan et al . 2001 ) ] was found approximately one arcsecond from the g1 optical position reported by @xcite ; this radio source has j2000 coordinates of @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "figure  1 shows our 8.4  ghz image of the 20  by 20  region centered on g1 ; this image includes a @xmath19 error circle of 15 radius for the x - ray position found by @xcite .",
    "the radio position has an estimated error of 06 in each dimension ( not shown in the figure ) , derived by dividing the beam size by the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability of finding a @xmath20 noise spike or background source so close to g1 is quite small , as indicated by the lack of any other contours of similar strength in figure  1 .",
    "if we hypothesize that there are 9 independent beams ( roughly 8  by 8) within which a source would be considered to be associated with g1 , then the probability of a @xmath20 noise point close to g1 is less than @xmath21 . similarly , the expected density of extragalactic radio sources at 28  @xmath14jy or above is 0.25 arcmin@xmath22 @xcite , or @xmath23 in a box 8  on a side , making it unlikely that we have found an unrelated background source . in order to search for possible data errors that might cause a spurious source ,",
    "we have subjected our data set to additional tests , imaging data from the two days separately , and also imaging the two different intermediate frequency channels separately .",
    "the g1 radio source remains in the images made from each data subset , with approximately the same flux density and position .",
    "the overall significance is reduced by @xmath24 to approximately @xmath25 in each image made with about half the data , as expected for a real source with uncontaminated data .",
    "other @xmath26@xmath25 sources appear in the central 20  box in some subsets of half the data , consistent with noise statistics , but none is above the @xmath27 level in the full data set .",
    "thus , all tests indicate that the detection of g1 is real , and we will proceed on that basis for the remainder of this paper . at 4.9  ghz , we find no detection at the g1 position , but the much higher noise level provides us only with very loose constraints on the source spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have quantified an empirical relation ( or `` fundamental plane '' ) among x - ray and 5  ghz radio luminosity and bh mass ; we use the @xcite relation @xmath28 . @xcite",
    "analyzed this relation in the context of accretion flows and jets associated with massive bhs .",
    "one might expect some general relationship among these three quantities , if an x - ray - emitting accretion flow onto a massive bh leads to creation of a synchrotron - emitting radio jet , with the detailed correlation providing some insight into the nature of that flow . by comparing the empirically determined relation with expectations from theoretical models",
    ", @xcite deduced that the data for bhs emitting at only a few percent of the eddington rate are consistent with radiatively inefficient accretion flows and a synchrotron jet , but inconsistent with standard disk accretion models .",
    "@xcite scaled the fundamental - plane relation to values appropriate for an imbh in a galactic globular cluster ; we rescale their equation here to find a predicted radio flux density of    @xmath29    using the previously cited x - ray luminosity and bh mass for g1 and our adopted distance modulus , this predicts a 5  ghz flux density of 77  @xmath14jy for g1 .",
    "however , taking into account the 30% uncertainty in the imbh mass , the unknown spectral index of the radio emission , and the dispersion of 0.88 in @xmath30 @xcite , the predicted 8.4  ghz flux density for g1 is in the range of tens to a few hundred microjansky .",
    "thus , our radio detection of 28  @xmath14jy at 8.4  ghz is consistent with the predictions for a @xmath11 imbh , but strongly inconsistent with a @xmath12 bh .",
    "since neutron star x - ray binaries in a variety of states have radio / x - ray ratios much lower than bh x - ray binaries @xcite , and thus another 2 orders of magnitude below the observed value , stellar - mass x - ray binaries of any type are ruled out as the possible origin of the radio emission in g1 .",
    "we can use the radio / x - ray ratio to assess other possible origins for the radio emission . here , we use the ratio @xmath31 as a fiducial marker . for g1 , @xmath32 , which is considerably lower than @xmath33 that is common to the galactic supernova remnant cas  a , low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( supposing g1 might be a stripped dwarf elliptical galaxy ) , and most ultraluminous x - ray sources ( cf .",
    "table  2 of neff , ulvestad , & campion [ 2003 ] , and references therein ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare the g1 source to various relatives of pulsars as well .",
    "for instance , g1 is within the wide range of both luminosity and radio / x - ray ratio observed for pulsar wind nebulae ( pwns ) @xcite , less luminous than the putative pwn in m81 @xcite , but considerably more luminous than standard pulsars or anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the 8.4  ghz luminosity of g1 is similar to that of the magnetar sgr  @xmath34 about 10 days after its outburst in late 2004 , and the lack of a 4.9  ghz detection would be consistent with the fading of sgr  @xmath34 two months after the outburst @xcite .",
    "however , there is no published evidence for a gamma - ray outburst from g1 , and the relatively steady apparent x - ray flux @xcite also argues against a transient source .",
    "thus , the only stellar - mass object that might account for the radio and x - ray emission would be a pwn ; using the scaling law given by @xcite , we find a likely size of @xmath35 milliarcseconds for a pwn radio source in g1 , implying that high - sensitivity vlbi observations could distinguish between a pwn and imbh origin for the radio emission from g1 .",
    "knowledge of the radio spectrum of g1 could provide more clues to the character of the radio emission , although either a pwn or an imbh accretion flow might have a flat spectrum . in any case",
    ", our 5  ghz observation simply is not deep enough .",
    "if we choose a @xmath36 upper limit of 30.0  @xmath14jy at 4.9  ghz ( @xmath36 chosen since we know the position of the 8.4  ghz source with high accuracy ) , we derive a spectral index limit of @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 , @xmath39 error in spectral index ) , which has little power to discriminate among models",
    ".    the x - ray emission from g1 may be due to bondi accretion on the imbh , either from ambient cluster gas or from stellar winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give approximate relations for the bondi accretion on an imbh in a globular cluster ; for an ambient density of 0.1  @xmath40 , an ambient speed of 15  km  s@xmath2 for the gas particles relative to the imbh , and a radiative efficiency of 10% , the bondi accretion luminosity for the g1 imbh would be @xmath41  ergs  s@xmath2 . the x - ray luminosity of @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath2 measured by @xcite thus implies accretion at just under 1% of the bondi rate .",
    "given that @xmath43 , a more likely scenario is that g1 accretes at closer to 10% of the bondi rate but with a radiative efficiency under 1% . in this context",
    ", we note that the radio / x - ray ratio for g1 is @xmath44 , which is above the value of @xmath45 used to divide radio - quiet from radio - loud objects @xcite . because this quantity traditionally is given in terms of the 210  kev luminosity , whereas @xmath46 would correspond to the value computed for the 0.210  kev luminosity given by @xcite . ]",
    "g1 therefore should be considered radio - loud , as inferred for bhs in galactic nuclei that radiate well below their eddington luminosities ( ho 2002 ) .",
    "if the globular clusters in our own galaxy also have central bhs that are 0.1% of their total masses , and they accrete and radiate in the same way as g1 , many would have expected 5  ghz radio flux densities in the 20100  @xmath14jy range ; flux densities often would be in the 110  @xmath14jy range even for less efficient accretion and radiation @xcite .",
    "as @xcite summarize , there are few radio images of globular clusters that go deep enough to test this possibility .",
    "@xcite points out that the square kilometer array ( ska ) will be able to test for the existence of imbhs in many globular clusters .",
    "however , based on our results for g1 , we suggest that it is not necessary to wait for the ska ; the current vla can reach the hypothesized flux densities with some effort .",
    "the evla @xcite , scheduled to be on line in about 2010 , will have 40 times the bandwidth and 6.3 times the sensitivity of the current vla in the frequency range near 8  ghz .",
    "this will enable the evla to reach the 1  @xmath14jy noise level in approximately 12 hours of integration , thus probing the range of radio emission predicted by @xcite for many globular clusters .",
    "we have detected faint radio emission from the object g1 , a globular cluster or stripped dwarf elliptical galaxy in m31 .",
    "the emission has an 8.4  ghz power of @xmath1  w  hz@xmath2 . assuming that the radio source is associated with the x - ray source in g1 @xcite , the radio / x - ray ratio is consistent with the value expected for an accreting @xmath0 bh .",
    "thus , the radio detection lends support to the presence of such an imbh within g1 .",
    "the other possible explanation , a pulsar wind nebula , could be tested by making very high - sensitivity vlbi observations of g1 .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
    "we thank the staff of the vla that made these observations possible .",
