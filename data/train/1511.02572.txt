    "a family of @xmath1-dimensional surfaces @xmath4 in @xmath5 is called the mean curvature flow ( hereafter abbreviated by mcf ) if the velocity is equal to its mean curvature at each point and time . since the 1970 s , the mcf has been studied by numerous researchers as it is one of the fundamental geometric evolution problems ( see @xcite for the overview and references related to the mcf ) appearing in fields such as differential geometry , general relativity , image processing and materials science .",
    "given a smooth surface @xmath3 , one can find a smoothly moving mcf starting from @xmath3 until some singularities such as vanishing or pinching occur .",
    "the theory of mcf inclusive of such occurrence of singularities started with the pioneering work of brakke in his seminal work @xcite .",
    "he formulated a notion of mcf in the setting of geometric measure theory and discovered a number of striking measure - theoretic properties in this general setting .",
    "it is often called the brakke flow and we call the flow by this name hereafter . it is a family of varifolds representing generalized surfaces which satisfy the motion law of mcf in a distributional sense .",
    "his aim was to allow a broad class of singular surfaces to move by the mcf which can undergo topological changes . quoting from @xcite : `` a physical system exhibiting this behavior is the motion of grain boundaries in an annealing pure metal [ ... ] it is experimentally observed that these grain boundaries move with a velocity proportional to their mean curvature .",
    "'' one of brakke s major achievements is his general existence theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) . given a general integral varifold as an initial data",
    ", he proved a global - in - time existence of brakke flow with an ingenious approximation scheme and delicate compactness - type theorems on varifolds .",
    "one serious uncertainty on his existence theorem , however , is that there is no guarantee that the mcf he obtained is nontrivial .",
    "that is , since the definition of brakke flow is flexible enough to allow sudden loss of measure at any time , whatever the initial @xmath3 is , setting @xmath6 for all @xmath7 , we obtain a brakke flow satisfying the definition trivially .",
    "the proof of existence in @xcite does not preclude the unpleasant possibility of getting this trivial flow when one takes the limit of approximate sequence .",
    "the idea of such `` instantaneous vanishing '' may appear unlikely , but the very presence of singularities of @xmath3 may potentially cause such catastrophe in his approximation scheme . for this reason , rigorous",
    "global - in - time existence of mcf of grain boundaries has been considered completely open among the specialists .    in this regard , we have two aims in this paper .",
    "the first aim is to reformulate and modify the approximation scheme so that we always obtain a nontrivial mcf even if @xmath3 is singular .",
    "we prove for the first time a rigorous global - in - time existence theorem of the mcf of grain boundaries which was not known even for the 1-dimensional case .",
    "the main existence theorem of the present paper may be stated roughly as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a natural number and suppose that @xmath0 is a closed countably @xmath1-rectifiable set whose complement @xmath2 is not connected .",
    "assume that the @xmath1-dimensional hausdorff measure of @xmath3 is finite or grows at most exponentially near infinity .",
    "let @xmath8 be mutually disjoint non - empty open sets with @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "then , for each @xmath11 , there exists a family of open sets @xmath12 with @xmath13 such that @xmath14 are mutually disjoint for each @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a mcf with @xmath17 , in the sense that @xmath18 coincides with the space - time support of a brakke flow starting from @xmath3 .",
    "each @xmath19 moves continuously in time with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "we may regard each @xmath20 as a region of `` @xmath21-th grain '' at time @xmath22 , and @xmath18 as the `` grain boundaries '' which move by their mean curvature .",
    "some of @xmath19 shrink and vanish , and some may grow and may even occupy the whole @xmath5 in finite time .",
    "we may also consider a periodic setting , and in that case , a typical phenomenon is a grain coarsening . as a framework , loosely speaking , instead of working only with varifolds as brakke did , we perceive the varifolds as boundaries of a finite number of open sets @xmath19 at each time .",
    "the open sets are designed to move continuously with respect to the lebesgue measure , so that the boundaries do not vanish instantaneously at @xmath23 .",
    "sudden loss of measure may still occur when some `` interior boundaries '' inside @xmath19 appear , but otherwise , one can not vanish certain portion of boundaries arbitrarily .",
    "the resulting mcf as boundaries of open sets is more or less in accordance with the mcf of physical grain boundaries originally envisioned by brakke .",
    "if @xmath24 consists of @xmath25 connected components , we naturally define them to be @xmath26 .",
    "if there are infinitely many connected components , we need to group them to be finitely many mutually disjoint open sets @xmath26 for some arbitrary @xmath9 , hence there is already non - uniqueness of grouping at this point in our scheme .",
    "even if they are finitely many , simple examples indicate that the flow is non - unique in general , even though it is not clear how generic the non - uniqueness prevails .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to clarify the content of @xcite with a number of modifications and simplifications .",
    "despite the potential importance of the claim , there have been no review on the existence theory of @xcite so far .",
    "also , we need to provide different definitions and proofs working in the framework of sets of boundaries . here",
    ", we present a mostly self - contained proof which should be accessible to interested researchers versed in the basics of geometric measure theory .",
    "a good working knowledge on rectifiability @xcite and basics on the theory of varifolds in @xcite are assumed .",
    "next , we briefly describe and compare the known results on the existence of brakke flow to that of the present paper .",
    "given a smooth compact embedded hypersurface in general dimension , one has a smooth mcf until the first time singularities occur . for @xmath27",
    ", it is well known that the curves stay embedded until they become convex and shrink to a point by the results due to gage - hamilton @xcite and grayson @xcite ( see also @xcite for the elegant and short proof ) .",
    "for general dimensions , one has the notion of viscosity solution @xcite which gives a family of closed sets as a unique weak solution of the mcf even after the occurrence of singularities .",
    "it is possible that the closed set may develop nontrivial interior afterwords , a phenomenon called fattening , and it is not clear if the set is brakke flow after singularities appear in general . on the other hand",
    ", evans and spruck proved that almost all level sets of viscosity solution are unit density brakke flows @xcite . as a different track",
    ", there are other methods such as elliptic regularization @xcite and phase field approximation via the allen - cahn equation @xcite to obtain rigorous global - in - time existence results of brakke flow .",
    "all of the above results use the ansatz that the mcf is represented as a boundary of a single time - parametrized set , so that it is not possible to handle grain boundaries with more than two grains in general . for more general cases such as triple junction figure on a plane and the higher dimensional analogues ,",
    "all known results up to this point are based more or less on a certain parametrized framework and the existence results can not be extended past topological changes in general . for three regular curves meeting at a triple junction of 120 degrees , bronsard and reitich",
    "@xcite proved short - time existence and uniqueness using a theory of system of parabolic pde @xcite .",
    "there are numerous results studying existence , uniqueness ( or non - uniqueness ) and stability under various boundary conditions as well as studies on the self - similar shrinking / expanding solutions , and we mention @xcite . compared to the above known results , our existence theorem does not require any parametrization and there is no restriction on the dimension or configuration .",
    "the regularity assumption put on the closed set @xmath3 is countable @xmath1-rectifiability , which allows wide variety of singularities , and the solution can undergo past topological changes . in this sense , even the results for the 1-dimensional case are new in an essential way .    on the computational side of the mcf of grain boundaries ,",
    "there are enormous number of works on the simulations and algorithms , which are far beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we simply mention for a point of reference that brakke developed an interactive software _",
    "surface evolver _ @xcite which handles variety of geometric flow problems including the mcf .",
    "see video clips of 1-dimensional mcf of grain boundaries of as many as n=10,000 in brakke s home page @xcite .",
    "we end the introduction by describing the organization of the paper . in section 2 ,",
    "we state our basic notation and present preliminary materials from geometric measure theory . in section 3 , we state the main existence results and give an overview of the proof .",
    "section 4 introduces notions of open partition and a certain class of admissible functions as well as some preliminary materials concerning varifold smoothing .",
    "section 5 contains a number of estimates on the approximation of smoothed mean curvature vector essential to the construction of approximate solutions .",
    "section 6 gives the actual construction of approximate solutions with good estimates derived in section 5 .",
    "section 7 and 8 are mostly independent from the previous sections and prove compactness - type theorems for rectifiability and integrality , respectively , of the limit varifold .",

    "the proof may be roughly divided into two phases , the first is the construction of sequence of time - discrete approximate flows , and the second is to prove that the limit satisfies the desired properties of brakke flow .      starting from @xmath238 where @xmath239 , time - discrete approximate flows are constructed by alternating two steps .",
    "let @xmath240 be a small time grid size which goes to 0 as @xmath241 .",
    "the very first step is to map @xmath238 by a lipschitz map so that the image under this map almost minimizes @xmath1-dimensional measure of boundaries in a small length scale of order @xmath242 but at the same time , keeping the structure of `` @xmath176- finite open partition '' ( definition  [ lfop ] ) .",
    "we introduce a certain admissible class of lipschitz functions called @xmath243-admissible functions for this purpose ( definition  [ lfop3 ] ) .",
    "this `` lipschitz deformation step '' ( 1st step ) has a regularization effect in a small length scale , which is essential to prove the rectifiability and integrality of the limit flow .",
    "the map should also have an effect of de - singularizing certain unstable singularities , even though we do not know how to utilize it so far .",
    "after this first step , we next move the open partition by a smooth approximate mean curvature which is computed by smoothing the varifold .",
    "the length scale of smoothing is much smaller than that of lipschitz deformation , and the time step @xmath240 is even much smaller than the smoothing length scale , so that the motion of this step remains very small and the map is a diffeomorphism . we need to estimate how close the approximations are for various quantities and this takes up all of section [ smc ] .",
    "we obtain a number of estimates which are expected to hold for the limit flow and this is a general guideline to keep in mind . after this",
    "`` mean curvature motion step '' ( 2nd step ) , we go back and do the 1st step , and then the 2nd step and we keep moving open partitions by repeating these two steps alternatingly .",
    "we make sure that we have the right estimates by an inductive argument ( proposition  [ exapp ] ) .",
    "once we have a sequence of approximate flows with proper estimates , such as the time semi - decreasing property and approximate motion law , we see that there exists a subsequence which converges as measures on @xmath5 ( not as varifolds at this point ) for all @xmath193 ( proposition  [ promecone ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to prove that the limit measures are rectifiable first ( section  [ secrec ] ) , and then integral next ( section  [ secint ] ) , for a.e@xmath133 @xmath22 .",
    "because of the way they are constructed , for a.e@xmath133 @xmath22 , we know that the approximate mean curvatures are @xmath244 bounded and they are almost minimizing in a small length scale .",
    "the latter gives a uniform lower density ratio bound for the limit measure ( proposition  [ rect0 ] ) , and since the @xmath244 norm of mean curvature is lower - semicontinuous under measure convergence , we are in a setting where allard s rectifiability theorem applies .",
    "this gives rectifiability of the limit measure .",
    "once this is done , we can focus on generic points where the approximate tangent space exists .",
    "since we only have a control of @xmath244 norms of approximate mean curvature , not the exact mean curvature , some extra information on a small length scale has to come in .",
    "this is provided by small tilt excess and almost minimizing properties , which show that the hypersurfaces look like a finite number of layered hyperplanes in term of measure in a small length scale ( lemma  [ itglem ] ) .",
