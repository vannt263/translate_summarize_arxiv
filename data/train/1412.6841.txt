    "constructing infinite families of ( optimal ) expander graphs is a very challenging topic both in mathematics and computer science , which has received extensive attentions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "bilu and linial @xcite succeeded in constructing expander graphs by taking @xmath1-lift operations iteratively .",
    "in particular , they relate @xmath1-lifts of a base graph @xmath2 with signatures @xmath3 on the set of edges @xmath4 , and reduce the construction problem to finding a signature @xmath5 whose signed adjacency matrix @xmath6 has a small spectral radius . furthermore , bilu and linial conjectured that every @xmath7-regular graph @xmath8 has a signature @xmath3 such that all the eigenvalues of @xmath6 have absolute value at most the ramanujan bound , @xmath9 .",
    "in a recent breakthrough , marcus , spielman and srivastava @xcite proved bilu and linial s conjecture for bipartite graphs affirmatively , by which they obtained an infinite family of bipartite ramanujan graphs for every degree larger than @xmath1 via taking @xmath1-lift operations iteratively , starting with a complete bipartite graph .    in this note , by considering more general groups of signatures , especially cyclic groups , we prove that for each @xmath10 where @xmath11 , every @xmath7-regular graph @xmath8 has a @xmath12-cyclic signature @xmath5 such that the maximal eigenvalue of the @xmath13-th power of its @xmath12-cyclic signed adjacency matrix @xmath14 in the sense of hadamard product is at most @xmath9 ( see theorem [ thm : main ] in section [ section : ramanujan ] for the general case ) . this generalizes marcus , spielman and srivastava s result for @xmath15-signed adjacency matrices .",
    "in particular , this enables us to show that every bipartite ramanujan graph @xmath8 can be used as the starting point of an infinite tower of @xmath0-cyclic lifts , @xmath16 , where each @xmath17 is again ramanujan ( theorem [ thm : tower3 ] in section [ section : ramanujan ] ) .    besides constructing expander graphs , the ideas around ( general ) signatures and lifts of graphs",
    "have been developed from various motivations , e.g. social psychology , heawood map - coloring problem , matroid theory , mathematical physics .",
    "we defer a brief historical review about these interesting developments to section [ section : history ] .",
    "we emphasize that the set of @xmath0-cyclic lifts is a restrictive class of @xmath0-lifts , which we like to explain briefly .",
    "let @xmath18 be a finite graph .",
    "for any two vertices @xmath19 , we denote the corresponding edge by @xmath20 if it exists .",
    "one can assign an orientation to it , say , directing from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , in which case , we write @xmath23 . the same edge with the opposite orientation is then written as @xmath24 .",
    "the set of oriented edges is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "a @xmath0-cyclic signature is a map @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the conjugate of @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 for every oriented edge @xmath31 , the three possible values of @xmath32 correspond to different local cyclic lifts , as shown in the following figures .",

    "we will show that the eigenvalues @xmath35 of @xmath36 satisfy ( lemma [ lemma : spectra of lifts ] ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the multiset union and @xmath39 is the conjugate of @xmath6 .",
    "we prove the existence of our construction by applying the method of interlacing families in @xcite and mixed characteristic polynomials in @xcite to our setting .",
    "the proof does not work for @xmath12-cyclic lifts , when @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", we have to find a signature @xmath5 , such that all hadamard powers of the associated signed adjacency matrix @xmath6 have simultaneously all their eigenvalues in the ramanujan interval ( see lemma [ lemma : spectra of lifts ] ) . for @xmath41",
    ", we only need to ensure that there is one signed adjacency matrix @xmath6 which satisfies this property .",
    "this is due to the fact that ( [ eq : sigintro ] ) implies that @xmath6 is hermitian and hence @xmath42 .",
    "we like to mention that the @xmath12-cyclic lifts of a bipartite ramanujan graph are a very special class and it is remarkable that such special lifts are sufficient to conclude that there are ramanujan graphs in this class in the case @xmath41 .    in this note",
    ", we consider the existence problem of cyclic signatures with particular spectral properties .",
    "for the special signature group @xmath15 more spectral theory of signed matrices can be found , e.g. , in the survey paper @xcite . in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we will extend results on cheeger type constants and related spectral estimates , developed in @xcite , to the more general case of cyclic signatures .",
    "given a group @xmath43 , which is usually finite , a general signature is defined as follows .    [ def : signature ] a signature of @xmath18 is a map @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45    for an oriented edge @xmath31 , we call @xmath32 its signature , and write @xmath46 , alternatively .",

    "in particular , we consider the permutation signatures , i.e. the maps @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the group of permutations of @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath12-lift @xmath62 of @xmath18 corresponding to the permutation signature @xmath59 is defined as follows : the vertex set @xmath63 is given by the cartesian product @xmath64 . for any @xmath65 , we call @xmath66 the fiber over @xmath21",

    "there is a @xmath71-to-@xmath71 correspondence between the isomorphism classes of @xmath12-lifts of @xmath8 and the switching classes of signatures of @xmath8 with values in @xmath60 .    in particular , if two permutation signatures are switching equivalent , then the corresponding two @xmath12-lifts of @xmath8 are isomorphic .",
    "observe that the @xmath12-lift of @xmath8 corresponding to a balanced permutation signature is composed of @xmath12 disjoint copies of @xmath8 .",
    "in 1953 , harary @xcite introduced the concept of a signed graph , which is a graph @xmath18 with a signature @xmath72 , and the notion of balance ( definition [ def : balance ] ) in this setting .",
    "harary was motivated by certain problems in social psychology , see also @xcite . the switching equivalence of signatures was then described by the social psychologists abelson and rosenberg @xcite , and later discussed mathematically by zaslavsky @xcite .",
    "another source of the ideas around signatures and lifts is the heawood map - coloring problem @xcite asking for the chromatic number of a surface with positive genus , which is an extension of the famous four - color problem .",
    "the heawood map - coloring problem is equivalent to finding the imbedding of every complete graph into a surface with the smallest possible genus @xcite .",
    "gustin @xcite introduced the concept of a current graph in order to solve this imbedding problem , which was proved to be very important for the final solution due to ringel and youngs @xcite . in the 1970s , gross and alpert",
    "@xcite developed gustin s current graph theory into full topological generality and interpreted gustin s method to construct an imbedding of a complete graph into a surface as a lift ( or covering in topological terminology ) of an imbedding of a smaller graph .",
    "gross @xcite further introduced the concept of a ( reduced ) voltage graph , which is a graph @xmath18 with a signature defined in definition [ def : signature ] ( gross called it a voltage assignment ) .",
    "a voltage graph can be considered as a dual graph of a current graph when both are imbedded into a certain surface .",
    "gross associated to each signature @xmath73 an @xmath74-lift of the graph @xmath8 with @xmath75 , the order of @xmath43 .",
    "observe that voltage graphs are natural extensions of signed graphs of harary .",
    "one advantage of voltage graphs over current graphs is that their correspondence to lifts is independent of graph imbeddings , and the concept of a voltage graph makes the understanding of certain aspects of the solution of the heawood map - coloring problem easier @xcite .    in @xcite , gross and",
    "tucker considered voltage graphs with @xmath76 and established their correspondence to all @xmath12-lifts of @xmath8 . in @xcite , a cycle",
    "is called satisfying kirchhoff s voltage law ( kvl ) if its signature is equal to the identity ( compare with balance ) .",
    "both kvl and its dual , the kirchhoff s current law ( kcl ) in the current graph theory @xcite , play crucial roles in the corresponding lift and imbedding theory .    in 1982 ,",
    "motivated by a counting problem of the chambers of classical root systems , zaslavsky @xcite introduced the concepts of balance and switching equivalence of signatures into gross and tucker s theory on permutation signatures and lifts , and he formulated the explicit @xmath71-to-@xmath71 correspondence given in theorem [ zaslcorr ] above .",
    "connections between permutation signatures and lifts were also discussed by amit and linial @xcite , and they employed them to introduce a new model of random graphs .",
    "first used such a random model in the quest of finding larger ramanujan graphs from smaller ones .",
    "this work stimulated an extensive study on the spectral theory of random @xmath12-lifts , see the recent work of puder @xcite and the references therein .",
    "agarwal , kolla and madan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.1 ) pointed out that another motivation of considering permutation signatures and lifts is the famous unique game conjecture of khot .",
    "the permutations assigned to each oriented edge satisfying ( [ eq : keyforsig ] ) appear naturally in the context of this conjecture .",
