    "a major goal of the information theory of quantum systems is the determination of the uncertainty fundamental quantities beyond the well - known standard deviation ( or its square , the variance ) in both position and momentum spaces @xcite .",
    "they include the spreading measures of global ( entropic moments , the rnyi , shannon and tsallis entropies and lengths ) and local ( fisher s information ) character @xcite .",
    "these information - theoretic measures quantify the spread of the position and momentum one - particle densities of the system ( which are the basic variables according to the density functional theory @xcite ) in various complementary ways and , in contrast to the variance , without reference to any specific point of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "moreover , they are closely related to various energetic and experimentally measurable quantities of the system @xcite .    however , they have not yet been or can not be analytically calculated ; not even for the one - dimensional systems with a coulomb , oscillator or infinite well potential despite they are very often used to explain and predict numerous physico - mathematical phenomena in science and technology .",
    "the present knowledge of the information - theoretic measures of the hydrogenic , oscillator - like and particle - in - a - box systems is described in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "therein we realize that the entropic moments and the rnyi , shannon and tsallis entropies are not yet known except for the lowest- and highest - lying states , mainly because they are power ( entropic moments , rnyi and tsallis entropies ) or logarithmic ( shannon entropy ) functionals of the corresponding densities .",
    "the calculation of the fisher information is somewhat easier because of its close connection with the kinetic energy .    in this paper",

    "this functional has been recently computed only in the two following cases @xcite : ( a ) @xmath12 fixed and the first few values of @xmath13 , and ( b ) @xmath13 fixed and very large @xmath12 .",
    "a main purpose of this paper is to calculate this functional for the generic pair @xmath14 , and then to find the values of all entropic moments , the rnyi entropies and lengths , the tsallis entropies and the associated uncertainty relations in momentum space .",
    "this opens the way to calculate various complexity measures not only in position space but also in momentum space .",
    "this is the case of the lpez - ruiz - mancini - calbet ( lmc , in short ) @xcite and the fisher - rnyi @xcite complexities , where the rnyi entropy plays an important role ; in particular , the lmc complexity of the particle - in - a - box has been numerically studied in @xcite and mathematically considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been recently reviewed the high relevance of these statistical complexity measures in analysing a great diversity of physical phenomena related with the internal disorder of the intrinsic structure of many - electron systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "firstly , in section [ sec : measures ] the information - theoretic measures of a one - dimensional probability distribution needed in this work are briefly discussed .",
    "then , in section [ sec : trigonometric_integral ] , the calculation of the trigonometric integral @xmath15 is explicitly carried out .",
    "the resulting expression is used in section [ sec : calculations ] to find the values of the entropic moments , rnyi s measures and tsallis entropies in momentum space , as well as the associated uncertainty - like expressions which combines them with the corresponding quantities in position space with integer orders .",
    "finally , the conclusions and some open problems are given .",
    "the uncertainty measures of a random variable @xmath16 are given by the spreading measures of the corresponding probability density @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "these measures are defined either in terms of the moments - around - the - origin ( or simply , power moments ) @xmath6 ( such as , e.g. ,",
    "the variance @xmath19=\\langle x^2\\rangle-\\langle x\\rangle^2 $ ] ) or in terms of the frequency or entropic moments @xmath20 $ ] of @xmath17 , which are defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22=\\left\\langle \\rho^{k-1}\\right\\rangle= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\left [ \\rho(x ) \\right]^k dx , \\label{eq : entropic_moment_definition}\\ ] ] respectively . from the latter quantities",
    "various information - theoretic measures have been defined , such as the rnyi entropy @xcite @xmath23=\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\ln w_\\alpha[\\rho ] = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\ln\\left\\langle \\rho^{\\alpha-1}\\right \\rangle,\\,\\alpha>0 , \\label{eq : renyi_entropy_definition}\\ ] ] and the tsallis entropy @xcite @xmath24=\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\left ( 1-w_\\alpha[\\rho ] \\right )    = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\left ( 1-\\left\\langle \\rho^{\\alpha-1}\\right\\rangle    \\right),\\,\\alpha>0 .",

    "then , it provides an estimation of the oscillatory character of the density while the rnyi , shannon and tsallis entropies measure in different ways the total extent in which the density is distributed .",
    "the five spreading measures previously defined , although interesting _ per se _ , can not be mutually compared because either they are dimensionless or they do not have the same units . to overcome this problem , following hall @xcite , we will use instead the so - called `` direct spreading measures '' to analyze the uncertainty of the random variable ; namely , the standard deviation , @xmath29 \\right)^\\frac12 $ ] , and the information - theoretic lengths of rnyi , shannon ( also called entropy power ) and fisher defined by @xmath30\\equiv\\exp\\left ( r_\\alpha[\\rho ] \\right),\\ ] ] @xmath31\\equiv \\exp\\left ( s[\\rho ] \\right),\\ ] ] and @xmath32\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f[\\rho]}},\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "all these quantities have the same units as the random variable , and they satisfy the three following properties : translation and reflection invariance , linear scaling and vanishing as the density approach to the dirac delta .",
    "moreover , all of them fulfil an uncertainty relation .",

    "since poles of @xmath54 with their multiplicities coincide with the poles of the sum from the right hand side , then function @xmath57 has no poles in the whole complex plain and therefore , by liouville theorem , function @xmath57 must be a constant .",
