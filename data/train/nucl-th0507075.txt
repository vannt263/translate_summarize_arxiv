    "the original proposal by weinberg  @xcite and carried out for the first time by ray , ordoez and van kolck  @xcite , of making model independent predictions for nn scattering using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has been followed by a wealth of works  @xcite ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "the renormalized potential as given in refs .",
    "@xcite in configuration space is expanded taking @xmath1 and @xmath2 as small parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pion and nucleon masses respectively and @xmath5 is the pion weak decay constant ) , with @xmath6 fixed . in this counting for the potential and in a given partial wave ( coupled ) channel with good total angular momentum the reduced potential can schematically be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are known dimensionless functions which are everywhere finite except for the origin and depend on the axial coupling constant .",
    "@xmath9 depends also on three additional low energy constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 which have been determined from @xmath13 scattering chpt studies in a number of works  @xcite .    at the level of approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_chpt ] ) these potentials are local and energy independent and become singular at the origin .",
    "thus , non - perturbative renormalization methods must be applied to give a precise meaning to the scattering amplitude  @xcite ( for a comprehensive review in the one channel case see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for a modern perspective ) .",
    "several methods have been proposed to study the lo term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_chpt ] ) for central  @xcite and non - central  @xcite waves .",
    "recently  @xcite we have shown how a renormalization program can be carried out for the nn interaction for the one pion exchange ( ope ) and chiral two pion exchange ( tpe ) potentials in the central @xmath14 and @xmath15 waves and its implications for the deuteron and pion - deuteron scattering  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend our analysis to all remaining partial waves with @xmath16 both for the ope as well as for the chiral tpe potentials . as we showed in refs .",
    "@xcite the short distance behaviour of the chiral nn potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_chpt ] ) , determines _",
    "exactly _ how many counterterms are needed in order to generate renormalized and finite , i.e. cut - off independent , phase shifts .",
    "these counterterms can be determined by fixing some low energy parameters while the cut - off is removed .",
    "it has been _ assumed _ that dimensional power counting in the counterterms can be made _ independently _ on the short distance singularity of the potential .",
    "this yields conflicts between naive dimensional power counting and renormalization which have been reported recently even for low partial waves  @xcite .",
    "so , one is led to an alternative : either one keeps the power counting and a finite cut - off or one removes the cut - off at the expense of modifying the power counting of the short distance interaction .",
    "the finite cut - off route has been explored in great detail in the past  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore further the possibility of taking the alternative suggested by renormalization and the tight constraints imposed by finiteness .",
    "the analysis becomes rather transparent in coordinate space , where the counterterms can be mapped into boundary conditions  @xcite at the origin . in practice renormalization",
    "may be carried out in several ways . in coordinate space",
    "it seems natural to exploit the locality of the long distance ( renormalized ) potentials and then to renormalize the full scattering problem . in the present work we adhere to this two - steps renormalization which has the additional advantage of making possible to determine _ a priori _ and based on simple analytical arguments the existence of the renormalized limit and how many independent renormalization conditions ( counterterms ) are compatible with this limit . in this regard ,",
    "let us remind that the main advantage of renormalization is that _ identical _ finite and unique results should be obtained regardless of the method of calculation ( coordinate or momentum space ) and regularization provided the same input physical data are used to eliminate the divergencies .",
    "in particular we also expect independence on the way how the limit is taken .",
    "the origin of the conflict can be traced back to the question whether for a given energy independent local potential , such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_chpt ] ) , one can assume any short distance physics regardless on the form of the long range potential .",
    "renormalization group invariance , however , requires that any physical parameter sits on a renormalization trajectory and the corresponding evolution on the renormalization scale is dictated by the form of the long distance potential at _ all _ distances .",
    "the precise trajectory is uniquely fixed by a renormalization condition at very long distances .",
    "thus , the separation between the short and long distance contribution is not only scale dependent but also potential dependent  @xcite .",
    "renormalization conditions are physical and do not exhibit this dependence .",
    "finiteness of the scattering amplitude and orthogonality of scattering ( and eventually bound state ) wave functions impose very tight constraints on the allowed number of counterterms and their possible scale dependence  @xcite .",
    "the discussion becomes rather straightforward in coordinate space and in terms of boundary conditions for ordinary differential equations .",
    "in addition , unlike momentum space treatments , a very natural hierarchy of the renormalization problem takes place in configuration space  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , orthogonality of different energy solutions requires an energy independent boundary condition on the wave function for the long distance local and energy independent potentials as it is the case for eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_chpt ] ) valid to nnlo , so that in _ all cases _ the effective range , and higher order threshold parameters can not be taken as independent input parameters  ) contains distributional contributions , which strictly speaking are zero for any _ finite _ distance .",
    "see the discussion in our previous work  @xcite ] .",
    "the results found in refs .",
    "@xcite can be concisely summarized as follows in the one channel case . for a regular potential ,",
    "i.e. , diverging less strongly than the inverse square potential , @xmath17 , one may _",
    "choose _ between the regular and irregular solution .",
    "in the first case the scattering length is predicted while in the second case the scattering length becomes an input of the calculation .",
    "singular potentials at the origin , i.e. fulfilling , @xmath18 , do not allow this choice . if the potential is repulsive , the scattering length depends on the potential while for an attractive potential the scattering length must be chosen as an independent parameter . in the coupled channel situation",
    "one must look at the strongest singularity of the potential eigenvalues at the origin , and apply the single channel results .",
    "in our formulation of the nn renormalization problem threshold parameters play an essential role .",
    "unfortunately , scattering threshold parameters for higher partial waves other than the s - waves have never been considered in the context of chiral potentials  @xcite . instead , some calculations adjust their counterterms to fit the phase shifts in the region above threshold to the nijmegen database  @xcite . in a recent work we have filled the gap by carrying out a complete determination of these threshold parameters for the reid93 and nijmii potentials  @xcite . on the light of this new information",
    "it is quite possible that the good fits in the intermediate energy region imply a somewhat less accurate description in the threshold region .",
    "this issue will become relevant in the description of some partial waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : form ] we review the formalism for coupled channel scattering in the presence of singular potentials at the origin . for completeness we list the potentials in appendix  [ sec : potentials ] . based on the short distance behaviour of those potentials ( see appendix  [ sec : short ] ) and",

    "specifically , we make a thorough analysis of cut - off dependence in all partial waves both for the ope as well as for the chiral tpe potential .",
    "we also discuss the perturbative nature of peripheral waves within the present non - perturbative approach . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we solve the coupled channel schrdinger equation for the relative motion which in compact notation reads , @xmath20 \\u ( r ) =   k^2 \\u ( r ) \\ , ,   \\label{eq : sch_cp } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the coupled channel matrix reduced potential with @xmath22 the reduced proton - neutron mass which for @xmath23 can be written as , @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the plus sign corresponds to the case with a positive eigenvalue ( repulsive ) and the minus sign to the case of a negative eigenvalue ( attractive ) .",
