    "the field of quantum plasma physics is becoming of increasing current interest [ @xcite ] , motivated by its potential applications in modern technology ( e.g. metallic and semiconductor nanostructures - such as metallic nanoparticles , metal clusters , thin metal films , spintronics , nanotubes , quantum well and quantum dots , nano - plasmonic devices , quantum x - ray free - electron lasers , etc . ) .",
    "in dense quantum plasmas and in the fermi gas of metals , the number densities of degenerate electrons are extremely high so that their wave functions overlap , and they therefore electrons obey the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the collective oscillations in quantum plasmas have been studied by several authors in the past [ @xcite ] with applications to the fermi plasmas in metals and semiconductors , and to electrostatic oscillations in quantum pair plasmas [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite studied experimentally the bohm - pines dispersion relation of the electron plasma oscillations by measuring the energy loss of electrons by the excitation of collective modes in metals .",
    "the fermi degenerate dense plasma may also arise when a pellet of hydrogen is compressed to many times the solid density in the fast ignition scenario for inertial confinement fusion [ @xcite ] . since there is an impressive developments in the field of short pulse petawatt laser technology , it is highly likely that such plasma conditions can be achieved by intense laser pulse compression using powerful x - ray pulses . here",
    "ultrafast x - ray thomson scattering techniques can be used to measure the features of laser enhanced plasma lines , which will , in turn , give invaluable informations regarding the equation of state of shock compressed dense matters .",
    "recently , spectrally resolved x - ray scattering measurements [ @xcite ] have been performed in dense plasmas allowing accurate measurements of the electron velocity distribution function , temperature , ionization state , and of plasmons in the warm dense matter regime [ @xcite ] .",
    "this novel technique promises to access the degenerate , the closely coupled , and the ideal plasma regime , making it possible to investigate extremely dense states of matter , such as the inertial confinement fusion fuel during compression , reaching super - solid densities .    in this paper , we present a study of the dispersion properties of electrostatic oscillations in a dense quantum plasma , by employing the wigner - poisson model .",
