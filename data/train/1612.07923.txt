    "on 14 september 2016 the first gaia data release ( dr1 ) was presented ( ( * ? ? ? * brown et al .",
    "gaia dr1 includes parallaxes and proper motions from tgas ( tycho - gaia astrometric solution ) for the majority ( but not all ) of the tycho-2 stars .",
    "the excluded tycho-2 stars include all of the very bright objects but also some dimmer ones .",
    "tgas proper motions exist for a significantly larger number of stars than for hipparcos and , for the stars in common between both catalogs , they are more precise .    the galactic o - star spectroscopic survey ( gosss , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maz apellniz 2011 ) ) is obtaining @xmath02500 , high - s / n , blue - violet spectroscopy of all optically accessible galactic o stars . to this date , three survey papers ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ( sota et al . 2011 , 2014 ; maz apellniz et al .",
    "2016 ) ) have been published with a total of 590 o stars .",
    "several additional hundreds have already been observed and will be published in the near future .",
    "our initial plan with gaia dr1 was to analyze the parallaxes in order to increase the meager number of useful trigonometric distances available for o stars ( ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * van leeuwen 2007 ; maz apellniz  2008 ) ) .",
    "however , the tgas parallaxes for o stars provide little new information , as the brightest o stars are not included and only one star , ae  aur , has @xmath1 6 , where @xmath2 is the observed parallax and @xmath3 is the parallax uncertainty .",
    "it should be remembered that , in general , @xmath4 , that is , the inverse of the observed parallax is not an unbiased estimator of the trigonometric distance ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* lutz & kelker 1973 ; maz apellniz 2001 , 2005 ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the tgas proper motions proved to have useful information . by cross - matching tgas and gosss ( including unpublished objects )",
    "we found 525 galactic o stars with proper motions , of which we discarded 5 due to their large uncertainties . for the unmatched gosss stars we searched for hipparcos proper motions and discovered another 96 objects ,",
    "of which 7 were discarded for the same reason . that left us with a total of 520 + 89 = 609 galactic o stars with good tgas or hipparcos proper motions ( of those , 427 are in the published gosss papers ) .    the proper motions in ra ( @xmath5 ) and declination ( @xmath6 )",
    "were transformed into their equivalents in galactic latitude ( @xmath7 ) and longitude ( @xmath8 ) . a robust mean for @xmath7 ( reflecting the solar motion in the vertical direction ) , @xmath9 , and a robust standard deviation , @xmath10 ,",
    "were calculated .",
    "for @xmath8 we robustly fitted a functional form @xmath11 and we also calculated the robust standard deviation , @xmath12 , from the fit .",
    "results for stars with good tgas or hipparcos proper motions are shown in fig .",
    "1 .     deviations used to detect runaway candidates.,title=\"fig : \" ]   deviations used to detect runaway candidates.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to detect runaway stars we computed the normalized difference ( in standard deviations ) of the difference between the observed proper motions and the fitted ones i.e. :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corrected proper motions , and sorted the results from largest to smallest ( table  1 ) . this 2-d method is simpler than a full computation of the 3-d velocities ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tezlaff  2011 ) ) and can yield false positives and negatives ( see below ) , but it has the advantage of being self - contained and , therefore , less prone to errors introduced by the required external measurements in the 3-d method ( distances and radial velocities ) .",
    "the runaway star candidates detected by our 2-d method are shown in table  1 , divided in previously known and new objects .",
    "the cut in @xmath16 is the same in both cases and was empirically established at 3.5 ( the stars at the top of the lists , ae  aur and hd  155913 , have values of 27.6 and 10.1 , respectively ) by comparing our results with those of @xcite .",

    "there are 33 objects missing but , of those , 30 were detected by @xcite based mainly on their radial velocities as they have ( a ) @xmath30 and ( b ) @xmath31 .",
    "one of the remaining three objects is hd  93521 , the highest - by far - latitude galactic o star ( @xmath32 ) , which is difficult to detect in a 2-d method designed for objects near the galactic plane .",
    "the other two , hd  108 and hde  227018 , have tgas proper motions with significantly smaller uncertainties and closer to the mean values than the hipparcos values , which were the ones used by @xcite .",
    "hence , a 3-d reanalysis would likely reduce their @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our method correctly picks up those runaway stars with large tangential velocities but , as expected , misses some which are moving mostly in a radial direction .",
    "what about false positives ? the final answer will lie , of course , in future work , but there is a good reason why the new 13 objects had not been detected before as runaways .",
    "eight of them do not have hipparcos proper motions and the remaining five were not included in @xcite .",
    "another indirect evidence in favor of the reality of the runaway condition for the new candidates is that in several cases it is possible to trace back the past motion of the star through its corrected proper motion to a cluster or an association as its possible origin ( table 1 ) .",
    "note that three of the new candidates are in the cygnus region of the galactic plane ( als  11244 , hde  229232  ab , and hd  192639 ) . for hd  46573",
