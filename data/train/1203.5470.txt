    "the coexistence of spin order and metallic conductivity in 3@xmath1 transition - metal oxides have attracted a lot of research attention since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in copper oxides .",
    "the metallic conduction is accessible by the introduction of carriers into either mott - hubbard or charge - transfer insulators in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen phase diagram .",
    "@xcite without carrier doping , metallic conduction is expected in the phase diagram when systems are located in the area with small or negative charge - transfer energy @xmath2 .",
    "such a situation can be obtained for large atomic number and high valence of 3@xmath1 transition metal .",
    "a typical example of the negative @xmath2 compounds is cubic perovskite srfeo@xmath0 , where formal valence of iron is fe@xmath3 ( 3@xmath4 ) and the effective value of @xmath2 is estimated to be @xmath5  ev .  @xcite metallic conductivity has been preserved even below an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition temperature @xmath6  k.  @xcite below @xmath7 , srfeo@xmath0 shows a g - type helical spin order whose propagation vector is parallel to the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "the observed vector is @xmath8 with lattice parameter @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite the magnetic moment is 3.1@xmath10 per iron at 4.2  k.  @xcite recently versatile helimagnetic phase diagram under magnetic field has been established and unconventional hall resistivity has been discussed in connection with topological hall effect in noncoplanar spin texture with scalar spin chirality .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to srfeo@xmath0 , cafeo@xmath0 is insulating below 290  k ,  @xcite where a charge disproportionation by the formation of fe@xmath11 and fe@xmath12 emerges .",
    "@xcite the difference may come from the compression of lattice due to small ironic radius of ca@xmath13 compared to sr@xmath13 .",
    "it is thus interesting to examine oppositely the effect of lattice expansion by replacing sr@xmath13 by ba@xmath13 .",
    "very recently cubic bafeo@xmath0 has been synthesized by low - temperature chemistry .",
    "@xcite the ground state seems to be afm and there is no charge disproportionation and no structural distortion down to 8  k , similar to srfeo@xmath0 .",
    "however , its helical order is different from srfeo@xmath0 : a - type helical order with a propagation vector along the [ 100 ] direction . here , @xmath14 with lattice parameter @xmath15 .",
    "by applying small magnetic field",
    "@xmath16  t , the afm state changes to ferromagnetic ( fm ) one whose saturated moment is 3.5  @xmath10/fe .",
    "this is also different from srfeo@xmath0 where saturated ferromagnetism ( 3.5  @xmath10/fe ) is achieved by applying more than 40  t.  @xcite    the helical spin order in iron perovskites has been examined theoretically based on a double exchange model explicitly including oxygen 2@xmath17 orbital .",
    "@xcite by adding superexchange interaction @xmath18 between localized spins , the g - type helical order is stabilized .",
    "though the reduction of @xmath18 changes the g type to the a type in small and negative @xmath2 region , it is not clear whether the change really corresponds to the difference of real materials between srfeo@xmath0 and bafeo@xmath0 . in order to include material information in theory",
    ", we need to perform the first principles calculation on magnetic structures in these compounds based on density functional theory ( dft ) .    in this paper , we perform non - collinear spin polarized dft calculations in srfeo@xmath0 and bafeo@xmath0 as a function of the propagation vector @xmath19 for helical spin order . we find that the dft calculation within local spin density approximation ( lsda ) requires on - site coulomb interaction @xmath20 and exchange interaction @xmath21 to explain experimentally observed propagation vectors .",
    "the g - type helical order in srfeo@xmath0 is nicely reproduced by the lsda+@xmath20 with @xmath22  ev , @xmath23  ev . in bafeo@xmath0 , although the g - type order is lower in energy , the energy difference between a- and g - type orders gets extraordinary small around experimentally observed propagating vector in contrast to srfeo@xmath0 .",
    "the energy difference between finite @xmath19 and @xmath24 ( fm ) orders is larger in srfeo@xmath0 than in bafeo@xmath0 , consistent with experimental observation that srfeo@xmath0 requires a larger magnetic field to achieve saturated fm state .",
    "the difference of the two compounds is attributed to the difference of lattice constant .",
    "this is confirmed by performing a model calculation that includes both negative @xmath2 and the difference of the lattice constant through the distance dependence of hopping and superexchang parameters .",
