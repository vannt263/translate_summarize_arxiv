    "the first pulsating x - ray sources , her x-1 and cen x-3 , were discovered in 1971 . since then , over 50 sources have been detected in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , with luminosities in the range @xmath0 and pulsation periods in the range @xmath1 . in many cases",
    "the x - ray spectra are well fit by a combination of a power - law spectrum plus a blackbody component ( e.g. , coburn et al .",
    "2002 ; di salvo et al .",
    "1998 ; white et al . 1983 ) .",
    "most spectra also display quasi - exponential cutoffs at @xmath2kev , and in some cases cyclotron lines are observed near the cutoff energy , implying magnetic field strengths @xmath3  g. iron emission lines also appear to be present in certain sources .",
    "the x - ray emission from bright x - ray pulsars is powered by accretion of material from the `` normal '' binary companion onto the neutron star .",
    "efforts to calculate theoretical x - ray pulsar spectra based on either static or dynamic models have generally yielded results that do not agree very well with the observed power - law profiles ( e.g. , mszros & nagel 1985a , b ; nagel 1981 ; yahel 1980 ; klein et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is probably due to the neglect of the central role of the shock in upscattering the radiation .",
    "consequently no satisfactory theoretical model for the production of x - ray pulsar spectra has yet emerged ( coburn et al . 2002 ) .",
    "motivated by the problems with the current models , we reconsider here the physical picture originally proposed by davidson ( 1973 ) , in which the accreting gas passes through a radiative , radiation - dominated shock before settling onto the surface of the star .",
    "in this situation , most of the photons are produced in a dense `` thermal mound '' at the base of the column , just above the stellar surface .",
    "these relatively low - energy photons are upscattered in the shock and eventually diffuse through the walls of the column , carrying away the kinetic energy of the gas .",
    "this fermi mechanism characteristically produces a power - law continuum at high energies .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate for the first time how the _ accretion shock itself _ can directly produce spectra very similar to the continuum emission seen in many x - ray pulsars .",
    "although this approach has been suggested before ( e.g. , burnard , arons , & klein 1991 ) , it has not been carried out quantitatively .",
    "the work presented here therefore represents a significant step in the development of a detailed theory for the spectral formation process in x - ray pulsars .",
    "radiation pressure plays a crucial role in determining the dynamical structure of the accretion flows in bright x - ray pulsars . in order for the accreting gas to be bought to rest at the surface of the star by the radiation pressure gradient",
    ", the x - ray luminosity must satisfy the constraint @xmath4 , with the critical luminosity given by ( becker 1998 ; basko & sunyaev 1976 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the stellar mass , @xmath7 is the stellar radius , @xmath8 is the radius of the cylindrical accretion column , @xmath9 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the mean values of the electron scattering cross sections for photons propagating parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the observation of many x - ray pulsars with @xmath12 implies the presence of radiation - dominated shocks close to the stellar surfaces ( white et al .",
    "1983 ; white et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the accretion flow is assumed to be cylindrical and highly supersonic in the upstream region . in this case",

    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the coordinate @xmath15 increases in the direction of the flow , and @xmath16 is the flow velocity at the sonic point ( @xmath17 ) , where the mach number with respect to the radiation sound speed equals unity .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 represents the distance between the sonic point and the stellar surface , which is related to the other parameters via @xmath19 in the far upstream region , @xmath20 and @xmath21 according to equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "since the incident ( upstream ) velocity is expected to be close to the free - fall velocity onto the stellar surface , we find that the sonic point velocity @xmath16 is given by @xmath22",
    "in a steady - state , one - dimensional model , the green s function @xmath23 representing the response to the injection of @xmath24 photons per second , each with energy @xmath25 , from a source located at @xmath26 satisfies the transport equation @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the photon energy , @xmath30 is the electron number density , @xmath31 is the flow velocity at the source location , and @xmath32 gives the number density of photons in the energy range between @xmath29 and @xmath33 . from left to right , the terms in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) represent the comoving ( advective ) time derivative , first - order fermi energization ( `` bulk comptonization '' ) in the converging flow , spatial diffusion parallel to the column axis ( i.e. , in the @xmath15-direction ) , escape of radiation from the column , photon injection , and the absorption of radiation at the thermal mound , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 appearing in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) represents the mean escape timescale for photons to diffuse out through the walls of the accretion column . if the column cross section is optically thick to electron scattering as expected , we find that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the diffusion velocity perpendicular to the @xmath15-axis , and @xmath37 is the perpendicular optical thickness of the accretion column at location @xmath15 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath38 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) controls the amount of absorption occurring at the thermal mound . in our application , @xmath38 must be computed self - consistently since the mound is a blackbody surface that acts as both a source and a sink of radiation .",
    "we will use an energy balance argument to determine @xmath38 below .",
    "our primary goal is to calculate the radiation spectrum @xmath39 resulting from the injection of blackbody radiation at the thermal mound .",
    "once the solution for the green s function @xmath23 has been determined , we can easily compute @xmath39 by convolving @xmath23 with a planck distribution . if @xmath40 denotes the number of photons injected into the accretion column per second in the energy range between @xmath29 and @xmath41 from the blackbody surface at @xmath26 , we have ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the gas temperature at the mound `` photosphere . ''",
    "the corresponding particular solution for @xmath39 is then given by the integral ( becker 2003 ) @xmath44 the accretion column in a bright x - ray pulsar is radiation - dominated , and therefore no net energy can be emitted or absorbed at the thermal mound . instead ,",
    "the absorption of radiation energy is almost perfectly balanced by the production of fresh blackbody emission .",
    "most of the energy appearing in the emergent x - rays is transferred to the photons via collisions with the infalling electrons while the radiation is diffusing through the column .",
    "based on the energy balance requirement at the mound ( @xmath26 ) , we can write the dimensionless absorption constant @xmath38 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the radiation energy density at the top of the thermal mound .    calculation of the radiation spectrum is simplified considerably if we work in terms of the new spatial variable @xmath47 , defined by @xmath48 which has the convenient property that @xmath49 in the far upstream region ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath50 at the surface of the star ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) is separable in energy and space using the functions @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the separation constant and the spatial function @xmath54 satisfies the differential equation @xmath55 \\",

    "the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are combinations of hypergeometric functions satisfying the appropriate upstream and downstream boundary conditions ( becker & wolff 2005 ) . the system must also satisfy the eigenvalue relation @xmath63 equation  ( [ eq13 ] ) determines the eigenvalues @xmath64 and the associated set of orthogonal eigenfunctions @xmath65 .",
    "the first eigenvalue @xmath66 is especially important because it characterizes the shape of the high - energy spectrum emerging from the column .",
    "once the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined , the solution for the green s function can be expressed as the infinite series @xmath67 where the expansion coefficients @xmath68 depend on the strength and location of the source . the phase - averaged spectrum emitted by the x - ray pulsar",
    "is computed by integrating the particular solution @xmath39 over the height of the column to obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 gives the number of photons escaping from the column per unit time with energy between @xmath29 and @xmath71 , and @xmath39 is computed using equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the associated high - energy photon spectral index , @xmath72 , is plotted in figure  1 as a function of the model parameters @xmath38 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that a broad range of indices can be produced , although we must have @xmath74 in order to avoid an infinite photon energy density since the model considered here does not include a high - energy cutoff .",
    "for given values of the stellar mass @xmath6 and the stellar radius @xmath7 , our model has three free parameters , namely the column radius @xmath8 , the temperature at the top of the thermal mound @xmath75 , and the accretion rate @xmath76 .",
    "the first step in calculating the photon number spectrum @xmath77 is to determine the value of @xmath78 ( or , equivalently , @xmath73 ) in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , which fixes the location of the thermal mound .",
    "the velocity and density at the top of the mound , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , are related via the continuity equation @xmath81 .",
    "the density @xmath80 can be calculated by setting the rosseland mean of the free - free absorption optical thickness across the column equal to one , which yields for pure , fully - ionized hydrogen ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath82 in cgs units , where we have set the gaunt factor equal to unity and introduced the conserved mass flux @xmath83 .",
    "once @xmath79 is computed , we can combine equations  ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) to obtain @xmath84 which determines the location of the mound . for typical x - ray pulsar parameters , we find that @xmath85 , and therefore the mound is situated very close to the surface of the star as expected . the final parameter that needs to be evaluated is @xmath38 . using equations  ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , along with equation  ( 3.11 ) from becker ( 1998 ) ,",
    "we find that the spatial variation of the radiation energy density is given by @xmath86 combining equations  ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) , we find that @xmath87 taken together , equations  ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq17 ] ) , and ( [ eq19 ] ) allow the determination of the four model parameters @xmath16 , @xmath79 , @xmath73 , and @xmath38 in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "this closes the system and facilitates the calculation of the emergent photon number spectrum @xmath77 using equation  ( [ eq15 ] ) .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the theoretical predictions for the observed count - rate flux distribution , @xmath88 , along with the observed spectra for the x - ray pulsars 4u  1258 - 61 ( gx  304 - 1 ) and 4u  0352 + 30 ( x  persei ) , respectively , where @xmath77 is computed using equation  ( [ eq15 ] ) and @xmath89 is the distance to the source .",
    "the 4u  1258 - 61 data was reported by white et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and the 4u  0352 + 30 data is the result of xspec analysis of an archival rxte observation taken in july 1998 and reported by delgado - mart et al .",
    "the observational data represent the de - convolved ( incident ) spectra , and consequently there is some weak model dependence in these results . in both cases we set @xmath90 and @xmath91 km . for 4u  1258 - 61",
    ", the model parameters used are @xmath92 km , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95kpc , which yields for the photon index @xmath96 . for 4u  0352 + 30",
    ", we set @xmath97 km , @xmath98k , @xmath99 , and @xmath100kpc , which yields @xmath101 .",
    "the distance estimates are taken from negueruela ( 1998 ) , and various amounts of interstellar absorption are included as indicated in the plots . the second source ( x  per ) is included due to its low luminosity , which presents an interesting test for the model . although the results presented here are not fits to the data , we note that the general shape of the spectra predicted by the theory agrees fairly well with the observations for both sources , including the turnover at low energies and the power law at higher energies .",
    "several other sources yield similar agreement . in our model",
    ", the turnover at @xmath102kev is due to planckian photons that escape from the accretion column without experiencing many scatterings .",
    "this effect will tend to reduce the amount of absorption required to fit the observational data .",
    "we have shown that a simplified model comprising a radiation - dominated accretion column with a blackbody source / sink at its base and a radiative shock is able to reproduce the power - law spectra observed in accretion - powered x - ray pulsars with a range of luminosities and power - law indices .",
    "the power - law plus blackbody form for pulsar spectra has previously been adopted in a purely ad hoc manner , but the new model described here provides a firm theoretical foundation for this general result .",
    "our work represents the first ab initio calculation of the x - ray spectrum associated with the physical accretion scenario first suggested by davidson ( 1973 ) .",
    "our goal in this letter is to highlight the direct role of the accretion shock in producing the observed spectra , and therefore we have not included many other details that are certainly relevant in some sources .",
    "for example , the observed spectrum of her  x-1 has a very flat power - law shape up to a sharp exponential cutoff .",
    "the photon index in this case is @xmath103 , which is outside the range allowed by our model since no high - energy cutoff is included here . in order to explain this shape , additional effects need to be included such as thermal comptonization , cyclotron features , iron emission lines , and the possibility of an ultrasoft component produced by the accretion disk or the surrounding stellar surface .",
    "the inclusion of cyclotron cooling is particularly interesting since it connects the magnetic field with the flow dynamics by altering the pressure distribution , which can lead to further changes in the spectrum .",
    "we intend to explore these issues in future work .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for several suggestions that led to improvements in the manuscript .",
    "pab would also like to acknowledge the generous support from the office of naval research ."
