    "in antiferromagnetic spin chains , the spin - peierls ( sp ) transition results from a coupling between the electronic spin correlations and phonons yielding a dimerized ordered singlet state below a transition temperature @xmath4 . the sp state has been formerly investigated in a few organic materials ( ttf - cubdt , ttf - aubdt , mem(tcnq)@xmath0@xcite , and more recently in an inorganic compound cugeo@xmath5@xcite . despite different crystals structures ,",
    "very similar physical properties are observed .",
    "for example , the critical exponent @xmath6 associated to the onset of the sp order parameter was found to be consistent with a 3d ising universality class in both cugeo@xmath5 @xcite and mem(tcnq)@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram also shows a common dimerized ( d)-uniform ( u ) boundary for all these compounds @xcite , in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "alongside , the sp state has also been found in series of quasi-1d ion - radical organics salts , including the ( bcpttf)@xmath7 @xcite , and the fabre series ( tmttf)@xmath8 @xcite , both with @xmath9 = pf@xmath10 and asf@xmath10 . in the ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 compound for instance , the transition takes place at @xmath11 k at ambient pressure for the salt with hydrogenated tmttf molecule @xcite and at 13 k in the deuterated one @xcite .",
    "these quasi-1d materials , however , display a slightly dimerized structure leading to a mott insulating gap below @xmath12k @xcite , followed by a charge ordered superstructure ( co ) at @xmath13k @xcite(@xmath14k in deuterated @xcite ) whose proximity with the sp transition has prevented the full characterization of its order parameter .",
    "indeed , inhomogeneous dielectric @xcite and elastic @xcite behaviors were observed in the vicinity of the sp transition for the hydrogenated and deuterated pf@xmath10 salts .",
    "although the magnetic field dependence of the sp transition temperature agrees satisfactorily with the predicted one ( d - u boundary ) , the field dependence of the order parameter appears to differ from the theoretical prediction @xcite , at variance with the inorganic cugeo@xmath5 material @xcite .",
    "the organic compound mem(tcnq)@xmath0 is composed of planar tcnq molecules which stack along the crystallographic @xmath15 axis producing a quasi - one - dimensional chains structure @xcite .",
    "below 335 k , the compound undergoes a metal - insulator transition that dimerized the tcnq chains @xcite , but leaves the spins degrees of freedom unaffected down to @xmath16k , where a second transition tetramerizes the chains and shows all the characteristics of the sp distorted state @xcite .",
    "however , not much is known on the sp gap in this system @xcite .",
    "moreover , deviations from the universal structure of the magnetic phase diagram have been reported @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 compound , which has also a triclinic structure , there is no co ordering or any known transition between 18 and 335 k in mem(tcnq)@xmath0 , allowing in principle a better characterization of its sp ordered state .    in this paper",
    "we investigate charge , spin and lattice effects on the sp transition in mem(tcnq)@xmath0 .",
    "charge effects are analyzed by measuring the microwave dielectric constant at 16.5 ghz , whereas spin and lattice effects are studied by measuring the magneto - elastic coupling at ultrasonic frequencies .",
    "an increase of the dielectric constant is observed below @xmath4 , consistently with the building - up of the sp order parameter .",
    "anomalies on two elastic moduli are observed at the sp transition .",
    "all these effects are studied as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the mem(tcnq)@xmath0 compound has a triclinic crystal structure and single crystals grow as long slabs from which small pieces having typical dimensions 2.4x0.8x0.4 mm@xmath17 are cut .",
    "the long axis corresponds to the stacking direction @xmath15 and the two large parallel faces correspond to the @xmath18 plane ( @xmath19 being the component of @xmath20 perpendicular to @xmath15 ) whose normal direction is @xmath21 .",
    "we used a standard microwave cavity perturbation technique @xcite to measure the complex dielectric function @xmath22 along the @xmath15 axis .",
    "a copper cavity resonating in the te@xmath23 mode was used at 16.5 ghz .",
    "the organic slab is inserted in a quartz capillary tube and immobilized by thin cotton threads to prevent any stress or movement during thermal cycling .",
    "the tube is then glued on a quartz rod to allow its insertion in the cavity and the precise orientation of the slab along the microwave electric field . following the insertion of the sample , changes in the relative complex resonance frequency @xmath24 (",
    "@xmath25 is the cavity quality factor ) as a function of temperature are treated according to the depolarization regime analysis after substraction of the tube contribution .",
    "we use a pulsed ultrasonic interferometer to measure the variation of acoustic velocity along @xmath21 relative to its value at a fixed temperature @xmath26 = 25 k , @xmath27 = @xmath28 / v(t_0)$ ] ; only the direction @xmath21 corresponding to natural parallel faces of the crystal can be investigated .",
    "the ultrasonic technique is used in the transmission mode and , because the typical thickness of the crystal along the @xmath21-axis is quite small around 0.4 mm , a caf@xmath0 delay line must be used to separate the first transmitted acoustic echo from the electric pulse .",
    "the acoustic pulses are generated with linbo@xmath5 piezoelectric transducers resonating at 30 mhz and odd overtones bonded to the crystals with silicone seal .",
    "since the crystal structure is triclinic , one acoustic mode is characterized as quasi - longitudinal and another as quasi - transverse ( polarization along @xmath29 ) . because the velocity is related to the mass density @xmath30 and a particular elastic modulus @xmath31 modulus through the relation @xmath32 , the @xmath27 data are directly the image of the relative variation of the compressibility modulus @xmath33 ( longitudinal ) or the shear modulus @xmath34 ( transverse ) , if we ignore the density variations in first approximation .",
    "because of unavailability , the microwave and the ultrasonic experiments were performed on only one crystal which had appropriate dimensions . a magnetic field up to",
    "18 tesla could be applied along the @xmath29-axis .",
    "unless otherwise stated in the discussion , all velocity data were obtained for a frequency around 100 mhz .",
    "in the insulating state below 335 k , the dielectric constant at microwave frequencies ( 9 ghz ) was reported in a previous work to be almost constant with an absolute value between 10 and 16 @xcite .",
    "although a small decrease was observed below 60 k , no anomalous behavior at the sp transition was reported .",
    "we present in figure  1 the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant @xmath35 below 60 k. the absolute value is just above 5 and it decreases weakly with temperature in a very smooth manner down to 18 k where a small enhancement is observed ; the dielectric losses @xmath36 show also a change in the decreasing rate below the same temperature ( inset fig.1 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 enhancement coincides with the onset of sp order below 18 k. to analyze more precisely this enhancement , the insulating state between 20 and 50 k has been tentatively extrapolated to 2 k using a second degree polynomial fit , as shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the substraction between the @xmath35 data and this extrapolation curve below 20 k gives the @xmath37 enhancement shown in figure  2 for different magnetic field values .     as a function of temperature below 20 k for different magnetic field values : 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 17 and 18 teslas .",
    "inset : critical behavior in zero field fitted to the power law @xmath38 ( continuous line).,width=321 ]    in zero magnetic field , @xmath37 increases rapidly with decreasing temperature below 18 k , saturates near 9 k before increasing further down to 2 k. the fast increase below 18 k and the saturation near 9 k appear to mimic the growth of the sp order parameter as previously observed in hydrogenated ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 @xcite ; for mem(tcnq)@xmath0 , however , the growth is much slower than for ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 .",
    "if we fit @xmath37 enhancement to a power law @xmath38 near the critical temperature @xmath4 = 17.9 k ( inset , fig.2 ) , we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "if we assume a linear relationship between @xmath40 and the sp order parameter , @xmath41 is associated to the related critical exponent @xmath6 ; its value is significantly larger than the one expected for a sp - one component - order parameter in three dimensions ( 3d ) , a value observed in similar dielectric experiments for ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 ( @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "this is surprising since mem(tcnq)@xmath0 is thought to be more isotropic , as shown by the lattice fluctuations precursor to the transition , which are three dimensional in character @xcite .",
    "moreover , an exponent consistent with a 3d behavior was reported for the x - ray scattering intensity @xmath43 for mem(tcnq)@xmath0 with @xmath44 @xcite . if one rather assumes that the dielectric response @xmath40 also scales with the square of the sp order parameter this would yield @xmath45 , a value congruent with the one reported in x - ray experiments @xcite . at saturation near 9 k ,",
    "the relative amplitude of @xmath37 ( 0.2% ) is much smaller compared to ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 ( 0.9% ) .",
    "this is likely due to the larger polarizability of the latter material caused by the ferroelectricity associated to the co ordering above @xmath4 .",
    "the further increase of the dielectric constant below 9 k does not appear to be related to the sp ground state .",
    "it rather shows a curie type temperature dependence possibly due to local electric dipoles .",
    "the total dielectric constant enhancement at low temperatures is the sum of two terms , the sp contribution @xmath46 just discussed and a curie tail of the form , @xmath47 , @xmath48 this assumption is further supported by the magnetic field effects reported in figure  2 .",
    "as expected , a magnetic field ( oriented along the @xmath29 axis ) shifts downward the sp temperature @xmath4 and consequently modifies the overall temperature dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "saturation near 9 k is progressively replaced by a variation of the increasing rate .",
    "the temperature dependence of the curie term does not appear to be modified by the magnetic field although the absolute value of @xmath37 is increasing with field ( the 18 tesla curve excepted ) .",
    "this increase is likely due to a magnetic field dependent @xmath46 at low temperatures as previously observed for ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 @xcite , and not a field dependent constant @xmath49 of the curie term .",
    "a modification of the coupling between the charge and the sp lattice distortion in a presence of a magnetic field , and not the zero - temperature value of the sp order parameter , may be responsible for this slight increase of polarizability at low temperatures .",
    "although the origin of the low temperature curie tail in the dielectric response remains to be clarified , it should be mentioned that in the same temperature range a curie tail has also been reported in the spin sector for the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .    for these dielectric experiments ,",
    "the determination of the zero field transition temperature @xmath50 is particularly difficult because of the slow power law in the reduced temperature ( @xmath51 ) and the presence of substantial critical scattering below and above the transition .",
    "following the example of x - ray diffraction experiments @xcite , the second derivative of @xmath46 with respect to @xmath52 yields the best determination of @xmath50 , which is also consistent with the ultrasonic velocity data shown in the next section . from figure  2 , we notice that a magnetic field increases the width of the critical domain without changing much the exponent @xmath41 .",
    "the velocity of the longitudinal and transverse elastic modes investigated here increases monotonically with decreasing temperature from 200 k down to 20 k , without indication of an unusual elastic behavior .",
    "below 20 k however , the sp transition produces a well defined anomaly that appears similar for both modes , although the amplitude is larger for the transverse one .",
    "we present in figure  3 the temperature dependence of the relative variation of the longitudinal velocity @xmath53 below 25 k at the two magnetic field values , @xmath54 and 16 teslas .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below 25 k in zero field , @xmath53 increases until it shows a local maximum near 18 k , followed by a dip and then an increase that continues down to 2 k where it saturates .",
    "in constrast with the situation found in other inorganic @xcite and organic @xcite materials for an equivalent elastic modulus , the dip indicates that this particular mode , @xmath33 , softens importantly near @xmath4 before its stiffening at lower temperature in the sp ordered state . a magnetic field of 16 teslas widens and shifts the anomaly down to 15 k without affecting the @xmath53 data above @xmath4 and only very weakly ( within the uncertainties ) in the low temperature limit where saturation is observed .",
    "these results suggest that the normal elastic background for this particular mode is given by the dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "when this background is substracted from the data , we obtain the sound velocity variation shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "if we locate the sp transition temperature near the minimum , after some fluctuation precursors , the sound velocity displays a sudden softening at @xmath4 , followed by a progressive stiffening in the sp ordered state that evolves toward its normal phase value in the low temperature limit .",

    ", the temperature dependence is very similar to the previous one although the elastic modulus concerned here is mainly @xmath34 , a modulus that has not been investigated for other sp systems . for this particular elastic mode ,",
    "the anomaly is much sharper in amplitude at the sp transition .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field are also similar to the previous ones , namely a down shift in temperature and a broadening of the transition , along with the absence of field effects above @xmath4 and at the lowest temperatures below 4 k ( within the uncertainties ) . similarly to the longitudinal mode , we simulate the most appropriate elastic background of the normal phase from the dashed curve of the fig .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] shows the result of the substraction from the background . at the approach of @xmath4 , the larger amplitude and the sharper edge in comparison with",
    "the longitudinal case appears coherent with the implication of a transverse displacement of the tcnq in their molecular plane in the sp lattice distortion , as revealed by neutron diffraction structural refinements @xcite . here",
    "again , the anomaly in the sound velocity superimposes two effects , a sudden softening at @xmath4 followed by a progressive stiffening in the ordered phase . for both elastic modes , @xmath4",
    "is determined from the maximum value of the first temperature derivative of the velocity data .",
    "in other sp systems @xcite , softening and/or stiffening anomalies observed on elastic moduli below @xmath4 were analyzed in a phenomenological framework of the landau free energy model .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a coupling term between the sp distortion of wave vector @xmath57 , which is proportional to the magnetic gap @xmath2 , and the uniform elastic deformation @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath58 @xmath59 being the coupling constant .",
    "this term is added to the sp landau free energy @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . as to the elastic energy , it is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bare modulus .",
    "the minimization of the @xmath65 with respect to the gap @xmath2 allows to calculate the equilibrium expression for the free energy , from which the renormalization of the elastic modulus @xmath66 can be extracted .",
    "one can distinguish two cases : first , for a biquadratic coupling term where @xmath67 = 2 in ( [ fc ] ) , only a stiffening of the modulus is obtained below @xmath4 , which is linear in @xmath59 , @xmath68 although this type of stiffening anomaly on equivalent elastic moduli was observed for inorganic @xcite and organic @xcite sp compounds , it can not explain the important softening seen at @xmath4 from figs . 3 - 4 . in the second situation",
    "when a linear - quadratic ( @xmath67 = 1 ) coupling term is considered , a softening of the modulus proportional to the square of the coupling constant , -@xmath69 , is found .",
    "moreover , when the sixth order term @xmath70 is taken into account in the free energy , it is superimposed to a stiffening contribution due to the onset of a finite @xmath71 below @xmath4 simulating the decrease of spin degrees of freedom responsible for the screening of the elastic modulus .",
    "this contribution is also proportional to @xmath72 , which gives @xmath73 as we have seen in figs .",
    "3 - 4 for mem(tcnq)@xmath0 , the stiffening is sizeable since the normal elastic behavior is , within the error bar , practically restored at low temperatures . for comparison , in the cugeo@xmath5 compound the restoration of the compressibility modulus parallel to the chain axis ( @xmath74 ) does not exceed 50% @xcite .    as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] , the transverse mode data in zero magnetic field can be reasonably fitted by the expression ( [ cii ] ) using @xmath75 with a critical exponent @xmath6 near 0.36 slightly smaller than for cugeo@xmath5 ( 0.42 ) @xcite and ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 ( 0.49 ) @xcite ; a similar fit for the longitudinal mode in fig .  [ fig.3 ] is however not reliable because of a too much scatter in the data .",
    "we close the section by considering the magnetic field dependence of the sp critical temperature , @xmath4(h ) , and check if it follows the mean - field prediction for the spin - peierls transition @xcite .",
    "first , we must decide how the transition temperature is determined to get a unique @xmath4 from the microwave and elastic data . for the microwave experiment",
    ", we mentioned that the second temperature derivative of @xmath37 was the most appropriate criterion for the determination of the critical temperature , which yielded @xmath76 17.9 k. in the elastic experiment , @xmath4 is most easily determined from the first temperature derivative of the transverse data because of the sharpness of the softening anomaly ( indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "4 ) ; this gives a temperature just above the minimum value of the softening .",
    "the same criterion has thus been applied to the longitudinal data ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in zero field",
    ", these procedures give an average temperature , @xmath4(0 ) = 17.9 @xmath77 0.1 k , a value falling within the range 17.1 - 18 k found from other techniques @xcite . in the framework of mean - field theory of quasi - one - dimensional sp systems @xcite , the sp temperature is predicted to decay quadratically with the magnetic field according to the expression , @xmath78 , \\label{th}\\ ] ]     for mem(tcnq)@xmath0 .",
    "experiments : microwave ( stars ) ; ultrasound ( triangles ) , longitudinal(blue and black ) , transverse ( red ) .",
    "the dashed line is the mean - field prediction from ref.@xcite.,width=321 ]    we present in figure 5 the part of the magnetic phase diagram representing the d@xmath79u phase boundary given by eq .",
    "the results of mean - field calculations is plotted with a @xmath80 value of 2.0 @xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed up to 18 teslas for microwave and longitudinal ultrasonic probes and up to 16 teslas for transverse ultrasound experiments .",
    "all the data points agree with the theoretical prediction up to the highest field values . up to 18 tesla , however , our data fail to reveal the d @xmath79high - field magnetic phase boundary for field scans at fixed temperatures , neither did they indicate the proximity of a critical point , as previously reported in magnetization close to 18 tesla @xcite .",
    "as far as the d@xmath79u boundary is concerned , mem(tcnq)@xmath0 shows field profile similar to the one found for the organic fabre salt ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we have investigated charge , spin and lattice effects in the spin - peierls state of the organic material mem(tcnq)@xmath0 and discussed them in relation with other sp compounds , especially the fabre salt ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 .",
    "charge effects were studied by the microwave probe , which show an enhancement for the dielectric response at the onset of the sp state .",
    "such measurements turn out to be relatively rare on these kind of systems , and few theoretical tools exist to account for the coupling of the charge degrees of freedom to the elastic strain ( lattice ) in sp systems supposed to involve almost exclusively spin degrees of freedom .",
    "differences noted from ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 , in particular concerning the critical behaviour of the dielectric constant could be attributed to the 3d nature of the lattice fluctuations and the absence of a co transition preceding the sp transition in mem(tcnq)@xmath0 .",
    "magneto - elastic effects were revealed by characteristic anomalies appearing on the ultrasonic velocity of two elastic modes .",
    "these anomalies can be described with the aid of a landau free energy model that includes a linear - quadratic coupling term between the elastic strain and the magnetic gap ; a situation that again contrasts with ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath10 for which biquadratic coupling is rather considered .",
    "globally , all these effects aim at a conventional sp system like the other inorganic and organic compounds , as far as the critical behavior and the magnetic phase diagram are concerned .",
    "the order parameter critical exponent can be associated to a one component universality class in three dimensions , as to the field dependence of the d - u boundary of the phase diagram , it is found to agree with the mean - field prediction for a quasi - one - dimensional system .",

    "<S> we report an investigation of charge , spin and lattice effects in the spin - peierls state of the organic compound mem(tcnq)@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the 16.5 ghz dielectric function along the chain axis shows an enhancement below the spin - peierls transition temperature near 18 k consistent with the charge coupling to the elastic strain involved in the transition . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of two elastic modes perpendicular to the chain axis presents anomalies at the transition which can be explained with a landau free energy model including a linear - quadratic coupling energy term between the appropriate elastic strain @xmath1 and the spin - peierls magnetic gap @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the dielectric and elastic features aims toward an order parameter with an associated critical exponent @xmath3 0.36 , which is similar to the three - dimensional behavior seen in other spin - peierls materials . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects studied in a magnetic field up to 18 teslas appear also compatible with a mean - field model of a quasi - one - dimensional spin - peierls system . </S>"
