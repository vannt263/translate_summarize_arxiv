    "fragmentation functions ( ffs ) are a key ingredient in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) description of processes with an observed hadron in the final - state . similar to parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which account for the universal partonic structure of the interacting hadrons ,",
    "ffs encode the non - perturbative details of the hadronization process @xcite .",
    "when combined with the perturbatively calculable hard scattering cross sections , ffs extend the ideas of factorization to a much wider class of processes ranging from hadron production in electron - positron annihilation to semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and hadron - hadron collisions @xcite .    over the last years",
    ", our knowledge on ffs has improved dramatically @xcite from first rough models of quark and gluon hadronization probabilities @xcite to rather precise global analyses at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy of qcd , including estimates of uncertainties @xcite .",
    "while the most accurate and clean information used to determine ffs comes from single - inclusive electron - positron annihilation ( sia ) into hadrons , such data do not allow disentanglement of quark from anti - quark fragmentation and constrain the gluon fragmentation only weakly through scaling violations and sub - leading nlo corrections .",
    "modern global qcd analyses @xcite utilize to the extent possible complementary measurements of hadron spectra obtained in sidis and hadron - hadron collisions to circumvent these shortcomings and to constrain ffs for all parton flavors individually .",
    "besides the remarkable success of the pqcd approach in describing all the available data simultaneously , the picture emerging from such comprehensive studies reveals interesting and sometimes unexpected patterns between the ffs for different final - state hadrons .",
    "for instance , the strangeness - to - kaon fragmentation function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is considerably larger than those assumed previously in analyses of sia data alone @xcite .",
    "this has a considerable impact on the extraction of the amount of strangeness polarization in the nucleon @xcite from sidis data , which in turn is linked to the fundamental question of how the spin of the nucleon is composed of intrinsic spins and orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons .",
    "current analyses of ffs comprise pions , kaons , protons @xcite , and lambdas @xcite as final - state hadrons . in this respect , ffs are a much more versatile tool to explore non - perturbative aspects of qcd than pdfs where studies are mainly restricted to protons @xcite . in the following , we extend the global qcd analyses of ffs at nlo accuracy as described in refs .",
    "@xcite to eta mesons and estimate the respective uncertainties with the lagrange multiplier method @xcite .",
    "we obtain a parametrization from experimental data for single - inclusive eta meson production in sia at various center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . )",
    "energies @xmath0 and proton - proton collisions at bnl - rhic in a wide range of transverse momenta @xmath1 .",
    "we note two earlier determinations of eta ffs in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite which are based on normalizations taken from a monte carlo event generator and @xmath2 model estimates , respectively . in both cases , parametrizations are not available .",
    "the newly obtained ffs provide fresh insight into the hadronization process by comparing to ffs for other hadrons .",
    "in particular , the peculiar wave function of the eta , @xmath3 , with all light quarks and anti - quarks being present , may reveal new patterns between ffs for different partons and hadrons .",
    "the similar mass range of kaons and etas , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and the presence of strange quarks in both wave functions makes comparisons between the ffs for these mesons especially relevant .",
    "of specific interest is also the apparently universal ratio of eta to neutral pion yields for @xmath6 in hadron - hadrons collisions across a wide range of c.m.s .",
    "energies , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and how this is compatible with the extracted eta and pion ffs .",
    "in addition , the availability of eta ffs permits for the first time nlo pqcd calculations of double - spin asymmetries for single - inclusive eta meson production at high @xmath1 which have been measured at rhic @xcite recently . such calculations are of topical interest for global qcd analyses of the spin structure of the nucleon @xcite . finally , the set of eta ffs also provides the baseline for studies of possible modifications in a nuclear medium @xcite , for instance , in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : next , we give a brief outline of the analysis . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the pqcd framework at nlo accuracy for the scale evolution of ffs @xcite and single - inclusive hadron production cross sections in sia @xcite and hadron - hadron collisions @xcite has been in place for quite some time and does not need to be repeated here . likewise , the global qcd analysis of the eta ffs itself follows closely the methods outlined in a corresponding fit of pion and kaon ffs in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all the details can be found . as in @xcite",
    "we use the mellin technique as described in @xcite to implement all nlo expressions . here , we highlight the differences to similar analyses of pion and kaon ffs and discuss their consequences for our choice of the functional form parameterizing the ffs of the eta meson .    as compared to lighter hadrons , in particular pions , data with identified eta mesons are less abundant and less precise .",
    "most noticeable is the lack of any experimental information from sidis so far , which provided the most important constraints on the separation of contributions from @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( anti-)quarks fragmenting into pions and kaons @xcite . since no flavor - tagged data exist for sia either , it is inevitable that a fit for eta ffs has considerably less discriminating power . hence , instead of extracting the ffs for the light quarks and anti - quarks individually , we parametrize the flavor singlet combination at an input scale of @xmath10 , assuming that all ffs are equal , i.e. , @xmath11 .",

    "although the assumption of equal light quark ffs seems to be rather restrictive at first , such an ansatz can be anticipated in view of the wave function of the eta meson .",
    "one might expect a difference between strange and non - strange ffs though due to the larger mass of strange quarks , i.e. , that the hadronization of @xmath7 or @xmath8 quarks is somewhat less likely as they need to pick up an @xmath20 pair from the vacuum to form the eta .",
    "indeed , a  strangeness suppression \" is found for kaon ffs @xcite leading , for instance , to @xmath21 . in case of the eta wave function",
    "one can argue , however , that also a fragmenting @xmath9 quark needs to pick up an @xmath20 pair from the vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , we have explicitly checked that the introduction of a second independent parameterization like in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) to discriminate between the strange and non - strange ffs , does not improve the quality of the fit to the currently available data .",
    "clearly , sidis data would be required to further refine our assumptions in the light quark sector in the future .",
    "the gluon - to - eta fragmentation @xmath22 is mainly constrained by data from rhic rather than scaling violations in sia . as for pion and kaon ffs in @xcite , we find that a simplified functional form with @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) provides enough flexibility to accommodate all data .    turning to the fragmentation of heavy charm and bottom quarks into eta mesons",
    ", we face the problem that none of the available data sets constraints their contributions significantly . here",
    ", the lack of any flavor - tagged data from sia hurts most as hadron - hadron cross sections at rhic energies do not receive any noticeable contributions from heavy quark fragmentation . introducing independent ffs for charm and bottom at their respective mass thresholds",
    "improves the overall quality of the fit but their parameters are essentially unconstrained .",
    "for this reason , we checked that taking the shape of the much better constrained charm and bottom ffs for pions , kaons , protons , and residual charged hadrons from @xcite , but allowing for different normalizations , leads to fits of comparable quality with only two additional free parameters .",
    "the best fit is obtained for the charm and bottom ffs from an analysis of residual charged hadrons @xcite , i.e. , hadrons other than pions , kaons , and protons , and hence we use @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the normalizations for the charm and bottom fragmentation probabilities at their respective initial scales , to be constrained by the fit to data .",

    "do not have a significant impact on any of the truncated moments shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles - ffs ] due to their limited precision and covered kinematic range .",
    "compared to pion and kaon ffs @xcite , all @xmath32 profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles - ffs ] are significantly less parabolic , which prevents one from using the hessian method @xcite for estimating uncertainties .",
    "more importantly , the shapes of the @xmath32 profiles reflect the very limited experimental information presently available to extract eta ffs for all flavors reliably .",
    "another indication in that direction are the different preferred minima for the values of the @xmath137 by the sia and @xmath72 data , although tolerable within the large uncertainties .",
    "our fit is still partially driven by the set of assumptions on the functional form of and relations among different ffs , which we are forced to impose in order to keep the number of free fit parameters at level such that they can be actually determined by data .",
    "future measurements of eta production in sia , @xmath72 collisions , and , in particular , sidis are clearly needed to test the assumptions made in our analysis and to further constrain the @xmath61 .",
    "the large variations found for the individual ffs in fig .  [ fig : profiles - ffs ] are strongly correlated , and , therefore , their impact on uncertainty estimates might be significantly reduced for certain observables .",
    "if , in addition , the observable of interest is only sensitive to a limited range of hadron momentum fractions @xmath13 , than the corresponding @xmath32 profile may assume a more parabolic shape .    in order to illustrate this for a specific example , we compute the @xmath32 profiles related to variations in the theoretical estimates of the single - inclusive production of eta mesons in @xmath72 collisions at phenix kinematics @xcite . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles - pp ] for four different values of @xmath1 along with the individual contributions to @xmath120 from the sia and @xmath72 data sets .",
    "as anticipated , we find a rather different picture as compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles - ffs ] , with variations only ranging from @xmath138 to @xmath131 depending on the @xmath1 value and tolerating @xmath139 .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty bands are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadronic06 ] above for both @xmath70 and @xmath140 and have been obtained for the other @xmath72 data from phenix @xcite shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hadronic2 g ] and [ fig : hadronic3pi ] as well .",
    "the uncertainties for @xmath141 are smallest for intermediate @xmath1 values , where the latest phenix measurement @xcite is most precise and the three data sets @xcite have maximum overlap , and increase towards either end of the @xmath1 range of the run  06 data .",
    "in particular at intermediate @xmath1 values , the main constraint comes from the phenix run  06 data , whereas sia data become increasingly relevant at low @xmath1 .",
    "the previous @xmath72 measurements from phenix @xcite are limited to @xmath142 and have considerably larger uncertainties and , hence , less impact on the fit .",
    "a first global qcd analysis of eta fragmentation functions at nlo accuracy has been presented based on the world data from electron - positron annihilation experiments and latest results from proton - proton collisions .",
    "the obtained parameterizations @xcite reproduce all data sets very well over a wide kinematic range .",
    "even though the constraints imposed on the eta meson fragmentation functions by presently available data are significantly weaker than those for pions or kaons , the availability of eta ffs extends the applicability of the pqcd framework to new observables of topical interest . among them",
    "are the double - spin asymmetry for eta production in longitudinally polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic , eta meson production at the lhc , possible medium modifications in the hadronization in the presence of a heavy nucleus , and predictions for future semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "the obtained ffs still depend on certain assumptions , like @xmath2 symmetry for the light quarks , dictated by the lack of data constraining the flavor separation sufficiently well . compared to ffs for other hadrons",
    "they show interesting patterns of similarities and differences which can be further tested with future data .",
