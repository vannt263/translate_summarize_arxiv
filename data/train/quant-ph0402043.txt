    "in the context of the quantum theory of optical coherence glauber found that the measurement operator for a photodetection can be associated with an annihilation operator@xcite .",
    "his assertion rests on the fact that the detection of a photon of energy @xmath0 is usually carried out with photoelectric effect , which absorbs the photon and dissipates energy @xmath0 from the field .",
    "any correlations measured by the absorption - based detectors are thus represented by the expectation values of the normally ordered product of the annihilation and the creation operators@xcite .",
    "the normally ordered photodetections can be said to be insensitive to zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field because the photodetection probability for the vacuum state is zero , i.e. , @xmath1=\\langle 0|\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}|0 \\rangle=0 $ ] .",
    "this insensitivity to zero - point fluctuations results in the photodetection process being _ _ logically irreversible__@xcite , that is , the premeasurement density matrix of the measured system not being uniquely determined by the postmeasurement density matrix and the outcome of the measurement .",
    "when photons are , however , detected by stimulated emission , rather than by absorption , the detection responds not only to actual photons but also to zero - point fluctuations via spontaneous emission .",
    "then , the antinormally ordered photodetection can be realized .",
    "owing to the sensitivity to zero - point fluctuation the antinormally ordered photodetection may provide an interesting alternative approach to continuously monitoring quantum system .",
    "this kind of emission - based photodetector , what is called the _ quantum counter _",
    ", was originally proposed by bloembergen for detecting infrared photons@xcite . the correlations measured by the quantum counters",
    "were then theoretically investigated by mandel@xcite .",
    "ueda and kitagawa showed that the quantum counter , unlike the standard photodetector , make it possible to perform a logically reversible measurement@xcite .    one way to realize the antinormally ordered photodetection is to exploit nondegenerate stimulated parametric down - conversion process . using this process",
    "we have recently succeeded in experimentally implementing the antinormally ordered photodetection and measuring the antinormally ordered intensity correlations for coherent states@xcite .",
    "the observed correlations were different from the normally ordered ones , as they showed excess positive correlations , i.e. , the photon bunching effects , or the hanbury - brown@xmath2twiss effects@xcite .    to properly account for the experiment",
    ", the detection process needs to be treated with time - dependent and continuous - mode operators@xcite because of the following reasons .",
    "first , in the experiment , a ultrashort pulsed field with the broadband spectrum was used as a pump of the parametric down - conversion to obtain large nonlinear response of the crystal and to overcome the slow response time of the photodetectors@xcite .",
    "second , as a nature of the parametric down - conversion , the spectrum of the down - converted fields themselves were broadband .",
    "moreover , we used a spectral filter for increasing the coherence time of the down - converted field to be larger than that of the pump pulse in order to observe the field correlations . in the previous report@xcite",
    ", we only presented the simple single - mode treatment of the detection scheme . in this article , we give a theoretical treatment of the antinormally ordered photodetection process by using the continuous - mode field operators and pursuing the detection process in the heisenberg picture . for the vacuum input ,",
    "the resultant expression of antinormally ordered correlation is equivalent to that of ou _ _ et al.__@xcite , which is obtained by treating the continuous - mode parametric interaction in the schrdinger picture .",
    "our expression for more general coherent field input reasonably explain our experimental result reported previously@xcite .",
    "the original theoretical proposal of the antinormally ordered photodetection , i.e. , the quantum counting@xcite as well as the subsequent theoretical analyses@xcite utilized the cascade emission process of atomic system .",
    "this resonant configuration based on the atomic cascade emission can be translated into the non - resonant configuration based on the parametric down - conversion .",
    "our experimental implementation of the antinormally ordered photodetection followed this line . however , to measure the antinormally ordered correlation is by no means a straightforward task because all normally ordered correlation terms should be eradicated .",
    "now , we begin by showing how our devised method@xcite works for measuring the antinormally ordered intensity correlation . here , we will treat the parametric down - conversion process in the simplest way and thus treat only a few single - mode operators relevant in this measurement process . in section  [ sec : c_mode ] , we will analyze the measurement process with the time - dependent , continuous - mode operators . a schematic illustration of the antinormally ordered intensity correlator is shown in fig .",
