    "first , one needs sufficiently accurate measurements of so - called  excess \" radiation ( beyond final - state decays ) to extract its spectral shape .",

    "third , model calculations and predictions need to be tested against the data which is critical for deducing mechanisms underlying observed spectral modifications .",
    "such comparisons not only require calculations of the in - medium em spectral functions but also a good control over space - time evolution of the fireball at each collision energy . finally , the model calculations have to be rooted in the bigger picture of qcd thermodynamics , and specifically in the context of chiral restoration by utilizing relations between the em spectral functions and chiral order parameters , where the latter can be tested ( or extracted ) from thermal lattice qcd .",

    "an intriguing aspect of the @xmath0-broadening as obtained from many - body theory in hot and dense hadronic matter is the prevalence of baryon - induced medium effects  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this is a consequence of quantitative constraints on the @xmath0-meson coupling to nucleons as deduced , e.g. , from nuclear photoabsorption data on the proton and on nuclei  @xcite .",

    "nonetheless , the question arises how the properties of the excess radiation develop with the nuclear collision energy , i.e. , with the relative baryon content in the system .",

    "this trend continues all the way down to relativistic energies in the bevalac / sis regime ( @xmath45=1 - 2agev ) , where a large excess radiation has also been reported  @xcite .",

    "it was pointed out , however , that at temperatures close to @xmath20 , the _ sum _ of the densities of baryons ( @xmath46 ) and anti - baryons ( @xmath47 ) is appreciable , about 0.7@xmath18 , and thus critical in producing a large broadening of the @xmath0 , since it interacts equally with baryons and anti - baryons due to @xmath48 invariance  @xcite .",
    "since the concept of chemical freeze - out continues to hold in nuclear collisions at rhic energy , the total number of baryons plus anti - baryons does not change appreciably until thermal freeze - out at @xmath49@xmath33100mev , and thus their density drops much slower than would be the case in chemical equilibrium ( where it would decrease dramatically due to the large mass penalty on baryons ) .",
    "the upshot of this discussion is that the hadronic in - medium effects at collider energies were predicted to be comparable to that at sps energies , and thus the low - mass dilepton enhancement at rhic and lhc is expected to be quite similar in magnitude and shape to what has been observed at sps .",

    "a new mechanism should thus be operative in central au - au at rhic , which does not prominently figure at sps , nor in more peripheral collisions at rhic .",
    "on the other hand , the star collaboration has reported preliminary data for dielectrons in central au - au(@xmath12=200agev )  @xcite , which indicate a much smaller enhancement , not incompatible with the effects expected from the in - medium @xmath0 broadening . at the recent quark matter",

    "a persistent low - mass enhancement was found in au - au at collisions energies of @xmath12=19.6 , 39 , 62 and 200agev .",
    "the invariant - mass spectra at the lowest energy ( 19.6gev ) exhibited the largest excess over the cocktail , and agree very well with the ceres data in pb - au(@xmath12=17.3agev ) .",
    "the predictions from hadronic many - body theory ( with a moderate qgp portion in the low - mass regime ) show good agreement with this excitation function .",
    "the star measurements ( together with the ceres and na60 data ) thus suggest a universal origin of the low - mass dilepton enhancement in urhics from @xmath50  10 - 200gev .",
    "new data reported by the phenix collaboration for peripheral and semi - central au - au , taking advantage of the hadron blind detector ( hbd ) , also support this scenario  @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration furthermore presented first measurements of the dielectron elliptic flow , @xmath51 . within the currently rather large uncertainties of this very challenging measurement ,",
    "the @xmath51 of the dielectrons in the low - mass region , divided up into several mass bins , was found to be compatible with the simulated @xmath51 of the decay cocktail ( mostly due to the long - lived @xmath1 , @xmath52 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 contributions ) . at face value , this result implies that the excess radiation carries a @xmath51 which is as large as the hadrons decaying after thermal freezeout .",
    "this assertion is , in fact , very consistent with the phenix measurement of direct photon @xmath51 in au - au collisions  @xcite , which was found to be compatible with those of pions for @xmath533gev .",
    "such an observation is difficult to account for through radiation which is dominated by early qgp emission  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be noticably reduced in a rather straightforward fireball scenario where most of the bulk @xmath51 is built up by the time the system reaches the phase transition region , in connection with photon emission rates for qgp and hadronic matter which continuously evolve across @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the latter feature is indeed satisfied when merging hadronic many - body calculations for photon production  @xcite with qgp rates in a complete leading - order perturbative evaluation  @xcite . at the same time , a fireball evolution with fully built - up elliptic flow and fairly large radial flow at @xmath54@xmath20 , is supported empirically by the systematics of the measured spectra and @xmath51 of multistrange particles ( @xmath55 , @xmath10 and @xmath56 ) , as well as by the constituent quark - number scaling of light and strange hadrons ; it is possible to realize these features in explicit hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phenix collaboration extracted an inverse slope of their excess direct - photon spectra ( defined by subtracting the primordial contribution from hard @xmath57 collisions ; late decays , such as @xmath58 , are already taken out in the definition of  direct \" photons ) .",
    "it was found to be @xmath59mev .",
    "this is a rather soft slope given its approximate decomposition into a true medium temperature and the blue - shift effect on massless particles due to an average radial flow velocity , @xmath60 .",
    "for example , for an average flow velocity of @xmath61 , the blue - shift correction amounts to @xmath5435(50)% .",
    "this further corroborates that the prevalent emission of the photons measured by phenix should be around @xmath20 . to summarize this section ,",
    "the excess of em radiation observed in urhics to date is remarkably consistent with a thermal source of dileptons and photons from a hydrodynamically evolving medium , and thus naturally fits into the current  standard model \" of these reactions . employing state - of - the - art emission rates allows for an accurate description of precision dilepton data at the sps , and accounts for data available at both lower sps energy and the most the recent spectra obtained in a first systematic energy scan in the collider regime of rhic .",

    "a novel element in this analysis is the postulate of a universal perturbative continuum in both vector and axialvector channel .",
    "besides its underlying physical motivation of degeneracy in the perturbative domain , it also allows for an improved description of the intermediate - energy vector data through the introduction of a @xmath75 resonance .",
    "it then turns out that a quantitative agreement with the right - hand - side ( _ rhs _ ) of wsrs 0 - 2 unequivocally requires the presence of an excited axialvector resonance , at a mass of about @xmath76gev ( wsr-3 also shows a large improvement )  @xcite .",

    "note that , although there are formally no interactions included , the excited hadronic states may be thought of as being built up by resonance interactions of the stable pions and nucleons . in the nonrelativistic limit , the pertinent sigma terms may be estimated using @xmath95 , so that @xmath96 simply counts the number of light quarks in @xmath88 . with @xmath97 ,",
    "one obtains the well - known result that the mere presence of hadrons diminishes the ( negative ) chiral condensate of the vacuum , @xmath98@xmath19 per light - quark flavor , i.e. , the  vacuum cleaner \" effect .",
    "the very existence of the resonance excitations in the hadron gas , which is one of the components in the @xmath0-meson broadening , is thus intimately related to the reduction of the chiral condensate .",
    "this notion can be carried further by realizing that the sigma term can be decomposed into a short - distance part associated with the hadron s quark core and a long - distance part associated with its pion cloud , @xmath99 , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon case .",
    "these two terms naturally find their counterparts in the medium effects of the @xmath0 spectral function , namely the ones induced by direct resonance excitations as well as through the coupling of its pion cloud to the medium , respectively .",
    "this puts the medium effects due to chiral mixing through ( virtual ) pions and due to the hadron - resonance gas excitations on equal footing .",
    "also recall that the hadron - resonance gas appears to be a good approximation to the qcd partition function for temperatures up to close to ( and even slightly above ) @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the next question is how this connection works out more quantitatively when analyzing the in - medium sum rules .",
    "this has been revisited very recently  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by adopting the newly suggested description of the vector correlator with ground and excited state and a universal high - energy continuum ( recall fig .  [ fig_vac ] ) . for the ground state",
    "the in - medium @xmath0 spectral function as used in dilepton calculations has been employed , while the perturbative continuum remains unchanged .",
    "this leaves the breit - wigner parameters of the in - medium @xmath75 to be adjusted ( in lieu of the continuum threshold in previous qcdsr analyses ) .",
    "for the temperature dependence of the condensates , the  non - interacting \" hadron - resonance gas expression , eq .",
    "( [ qqbar - med ] ) , has been used for the 2-quark condensate , which turns out to agree rather well with lattice data , cf .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_med ] ( a small correction has been introduced to better reproduce the lattice data in the vicinity of @xmath100 ) .",
    "the 4-quark and gluon condensate are treated analogously , where the former includes correction terms to vanish at the same temperature as the 2-quark condensate .",
    "it turns out that the qcdsrs can be rather well satisfied even until close to the vanishing of the quark condensates , provided that the @xmath75 also melts , cf .",
    "right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_med ] . of course , one should keep in mind that the vanishing of the quark condensates in the hadron - resonance gas is unrelated to a real phase transition , although it may still indicate that this model captures basic aspects of the medium when extrapolated close to @xmath20 .",
    "this argument also applies to the in - medium calculations of the @xmath0 spectral function which should be rather reliable up to temperatures of about @xmath17mev , where the total hadron density has reached about 2@xmath18 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , it is quite intriguing that dilepton data support a smooth extrapolation of the medium effects into the transition region .",
    "the analyses of the wsrs in this framework requires the knowledge of the in - medium axialvector spectral function , which is not available ( yet ) .",
    "preliminary studies using anstze for the in - medium breit - wigner shape for @xmath3 and @xmath62 that satisfy the axialvector qcdsr , indicate agreement with the in - medium wsrs , with a tendency of the vector and axialvector to degenerate into rather structureless spectral functions .",

    "another test of the in - medium vector spectral function , and of the associated chiral - restoration mechanism , can be provided by thermal lattice qcd . in the latter ,",
    "the information on the correlation function in a specific hadronic channel , @xmath102 , is routinely computed in euclidean time , @xmath103 . after a fourier transform in the spatial coordinates ( from @xmath104 to @xmath105 ) , the relation to the spectral function in the physical ( timelike )",

    "\\label{pi - tau2}\\ ] ] thus , via simple a integration over a model spectral function one can directly compare to  lattice data \" .",
    "the computational effort to compute the euclidean correlators in full qcd with dynamical quarks is formidable and no results for light vector mesons are currently available .",
    "however , in the quenched approximation , these calculations have achieved good accuracy in a gluon plasma above @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare the trends in these computations to what one obtains from the spectral functions used in the interpretation of dilepton data .",
    "this is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_lat ] , depicting the euclidean correlators normalized to the perturbative ( non - interacting ) @xmath107 continuum .",
    "the hadronic spectral function , extrapolated to a temperature of @xmath39=180mev , shows a significant enhancement at large @xmath73 which is a direct manifestation of the low - mass enhancement generated by medium effects ( critical for the description of dilepton data ) .",
    "in fact , even the vacuum spectral function shows this effect , caused by the free @xmath0 and @xmath9 resonances ; the in - medium broadening roughly doubles this enhancement .",
    "the quenched lattice data  @xcite show a surprisingly similar trend , given that they are computed at 1.45@xmath44 .",
    "note that chiral symmetry is restored under these conditions  @xcite . to extract the spectral function from the lattice data",
    "is more involved . in ref .",
    "@xcite a physically motivated 3-parameter ansatz has been fit to the correlators resulting in a conductivity maximum at low - energy , followed by a smooth transition into the perturbative continuum at high energy ( see black solid line in the right panel of fig .  [ fig_lat ] ) . comparing this to the hadronic spectral functions , one observes a trend suggestive of approaching the lattice data via a melting of the vacuum @xmath0 resonance structure .",
    "low - mass dilepton data in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions provide a unique glimpse at the vector spectral function inside the produced hot and dense medium . after the initial discovery of large medium effects in the early and mid 90 s , recent data are now allowing for quantitative tests of theoretical calculations . at sps energies ,",
    "a strongly broadened @xmath0-meson spectral function , due to many - body effects in hot and dense hadronic matter , accounts well for both ceres and na60 data .",
    "slope analyses of invariant - mass and transverse - momentum spectra corroborate that the observed spectral modifications at low mass originate from temperatures in the vicinity of the qcd transition region , @xmath20@xmath33160 - 170mev . if this picture is correct , very similar effects are expected for the low - mass dilepton spectra at collider energies .",
    "very recent star data have given first evidence for the universality of the low - mass excess with collision energy , but are hopefully only the beginning of a systematic multi - differential investigation of dilepton observables .",
    "the transition from the baryon - rich to net - baryon free matter is a critical test of the current understanding of medium effects driven by baryon plus anti - baryon densities in the vector spectral function . at the same time , the large phenix photon-@xmath51 is most naturally associated with radiation from around @xmath20 , even at full rhic energy .",
    "the large phenix dilepton excess in central au - au remains a puzzle which most likely requires a new type of radiation source .",
    "we have then argued that the mechanisms underlying these medium effects , namely resonance excitations and ( virtual ) pion - cloud modifications , find their direct counterpart in the sigma - terms of the heat - bath particles .",
    "this is significant as the sigma - terms are at the origin of the reduction of the chiral quark condensate .",
    "even though this mechanism only captures the leading dependence in the scalar density of the medium particles , it is remarkable that this ansatz describes the lattice data for the quark condensate rather well until close to the ( pseudo- ) transition temperature .",
    "although the resonance gas does not incorporate criticality , the resonance excitations represent interaction contributions which amount to higher orders in the density of the stable pions and nucleons .",
    "when evaluating the relation between the in - medium vector spectral function and the decreasing condensate(s ) more quantitatively using qcd sum rules , a reasonable consistency is found ; studies of the weinberg sum rules are ongoing . finally , the calculations of euclidean correlators and their comparison to current lattice data also reveal a common trend toward a rather structureless spectral function .",
    "all this suggests that the @xmath0-meson melting scenario is quite consistent with different angles on chiral symmetry restoration . to develop these indications into a quantitative proof , and/or unravel hitherto unknown aspects of chiral restoration ,",
    "remains a challenge .",
    "experimental information from the collider experiments will be critical in guiding further theoretical efforts , and vice versa .",
