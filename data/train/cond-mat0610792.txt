    "after the discovery of the carbon nanotubes ( cnt s ) in 1991,@xcite there have been several methods to prepare cnt s with ultra small diameters . previously , cnt s were synthesized in a free space@xcite and the quotient of narrow cnt s is quite low .",
    "afterwards z. k. tang _",
    "et  al._@xcite initiated to grew single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnt s ) inside a channel of zeolite templates .",
    "the swcnt s prepared in this way have the diameter as small as 0.42 @xmath0 0.02  nm .",
    "actually there are three kinds of tubes with different chiralities in this diameter range : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "a fabrication process was further developed to prepare a type of samples with @xmath4 and @xmath5 only@xcite with a very narrow diameter distribution .",
    "more recently , a stable cnt s with diameter 0.3  nm is found inside a multi - walled carbon nanotube.@xcite as shown by the density functional studies@xcite that this cnt might be interpreted as the armchair cnt @xmath6 with a radial breathing mode ( rbm ) at 787  @xmath7 .",
    "all these technological improvements stimulated progressively experimental and theoretical studies on the ultra narrow swcnts.@xcite    since the narrow cnt s possess biggish curvatures , the equilibrium geometries would deviate from the ideal geometry , i.e. , deduced from a seamlessly rolling up planar graphitic lattice sheet referring to a chiral vector @xmath8.@xcite various methods have been developed to determine the equilibrium geometry of free swcnts.@xcite among others , in ref .  , the author calculated the total energy for narrow swcnt s with a first - principles , all - electron , self - consistent local - density functional band - structure method .",
    "the calculated total energy can be parameterized in terms of five profitable parameters i.e . , generalized motif variables ( gmvs)with the line group symmetry intimately retained .",
    "the equilibrium geometry is obtained by an optimization procedure with respect to these gmv s . in ref .",
    ", a molecular mechanical model for the effective total potential energy is proposed to calculate the equilibrium structure and the strain energy of achiral swcnt s which is a quadratic form of lattice site displacements with respect to the planar graphite sheet .",
    "apart from deviations of three bond lengths and three bond angles , a pyramidalization angle is introduced to describe the energy associated with the curvature .",
    "the calculated results are consistent with existing numerical results based on _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "moreover , based upon the relaxed equilibrium geometry provided by _ ab initio _",
    "method,@xcite milosevi _",
    "et al._@xcite applied the line - group symmetry - based force constant method to calculate the vibrational modes of ultra - narrow swcnt s , in which the fitted force constants of narrow swcnt s have been adjusted with respect to the provided cylindrical web geometry .",
    "besides , the elastic properties for carbon nanotubes have stimulated a large number of experimental and theoretical studies.@xcite in particular , the young s modulus is a significant physical quantity which reflects the striction of equilibrium structure in response to the impressed load . in ref .  , the axis young s modulus of the swcnt is measured as 1.2  tpa by atomic force microscope technique . by observing their freestanding room - temperature vibrations in a transmission electron",
    "microscope,@xcite the young s modulus for 27 nanotubes in the diameter range 1.0 - 1.5  nm were measured and the average young s modulus is 1.25 - 0.35/+0.45 tpa.@xcite an interesting fact was acknowledged that the young s modulus of certain nanotubes is even higher than that of bulk graphite .",
    "there have been a large number of theoretical calculations for the young s modulus and the poisson ratio .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "method,@xcite tight - binding approximation,@xcite and force constant model@xcite gave the results of young s modules with a range from 1 to 1.24  tpa , and poisson ratio in a range 0.16 - 0.27 .",
    "it further shows that the calculated results vary slightly with different radii and chiralities .",
    "however , in refs  , the calculated young s modulus or the poisson ratio are found to be chirality and tube radius - dependent . in ref  , the poisson ratio of armchair tubes has the value larger than that of planar graphene sheet while for zigzag tubes smaller , and its planar sheet limit is 0.21 . in refs   and ,",
    "the poisson ratio decreases with increasing the tube diameter with the large diameter limit as 0.16 .",
    "anyhow , to our knowledge the resolution of the experimental measurements for the young s modulus and poisson ratio is still not enough satisfactory yet and the varies correspondent theoretical calculations are even more diverse .    as we have seen in above , _ to figure out the total potential energy of swcnt s as the functional of cylindrical lattice configuration is the key issue underlying the investigation of the equilibrium structure , strain energy , young s modulus and lattice dynamics of ultra - narrow tubes .",
    "_    in this paper , we propose that the total potential energy for swcnt s can be extracted from the vibrational energy of the planar graphene sheet with five force constants . in which the bi - linear forms of the lattice site displacements are accounted with the equilibrium lattice configuration of the planar graphite as the reference point , while one of the potential term for the twist motion needs to be improved by including a quartic term to account the non - linear effect . one of the advantages of our proposal is that the equilibrium structure , the elasticity , and the lattice dynamic properties for all kinds of swcnt s are calculated in terms of the same set of six ( 5 + 1 ) force constants , which essentially reflects an unified microscopic mechanism founded on the five forms of motion of the graphite - type cylindrical lattice sheet . based upon the proposal , we investigate systematically the relaxed lattice configuration for narrow swcnt s , the strain energy , the young s modulus and poisson ratio , and the lattice vibrational properties respected to the relaxed equilibrium tubule structure .",
    "the calculated results are nicely in consistency with the existing experimental measurements .",
    "in particular , our calculation reveals a generic feature that the relaxation effect exhibits itself in stretching the bond lengths as well as softening the mode frequencies for all kinds of swcnt s ; it provides a kind of evidence that the young s modulus of armchair tubes exceeds that of the planar graphene sheet , i.e. , when the radius increases , the calculated values of the young s modulus for armchair tubes approach that of the graphite from above and those of zigzag tubes from below .",
    "meanwhile , the large diameter limits of the young s modulus and poisson ratio are in agreement with the experimental values of the graphite ; the calculated rbm for the ultra narrow tubes with diameter range between 0.2 - 0.5  nm coincide the experimental results@xcite and the existing _ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite with satisfaction . for narrow tubes of diameter 2",
    "nm , the calculated frequencies of optical modes in tubule tangential plane as well as those of rbm are also in good agreement with the experimental measurement;@xcite the honeycomb lattice symmetry - based chiral expansion for physical quantities of swcnt s with ideal geometry@xcite can be retained for those of relaxed swcnt s by changing the chiral angle into its counterpart defined in tubes of ideal geometry ; as expected , for tubes with diameter larger than approximately 0.8  nm where the relaxation effect dies away , the calculated frequencies and the sound velocities for various vibration modes are in accord with those of the tubes of ideal geometry.@xcite    in section ii , the total potential energy for swcnt s is presented , and the relaxed equilibrium geometry and correspondent strain energy are discussed .",
    "section iii is devoted to the lattice dynamics for ultra - narrow swcnt s , while section iv for the young s modulus and poisson ratio .",
    "finally , the conclusion is in section v.",
    "we recall the geometrical description for the relaxed equilibrium structure of swcnt s particularly for the ultra - narrow tubes following ref .  .",
    "as for the cylindrical coordinate description shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanotube ] , we first set the @xmath9 axis along the tube axis , while the @xmath10 axis is fixed passing through one of the @xmath11 atoms .",
    "we further introduce a planar image of the cylindrical lattice sheet by unfolding the cylindrical tube into a planar lattice sheet , which is actually a tangential plane with the tangent line as a generatrix passing through the @xmath11 atom , and set atom @xmath11 as the origin of the plane with coordinates as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of atom @xmath11 . the planar lattice sheet is constituted of parallelogram primitive cells with @xmath14 and @xmath15 as its basic vectors .",
    "the deviations of cnt s with relaxed geometry from that of ideal geometry can be illustrated most conveniently by the primitive cells on the image plane .",
    "for that of ideal geometry , the basic vectors are of equal magnitude with an intra - angle of @xmath16 between themselves , while for that of the relaxed geometry , their magnitudes are no more equal and the angle can be deviated from @xmath17 . meanwhile",
    ", the location of the in - cell @xmath18 atom relative to @xmath11 atom could also be deviated from that of the ideal geometry .    [",
    "0.8 ]    now we introduce the chiral vector @xmath8 initiated from the atom @xmath11 along the @xmath19 axis in the image sheet , and @xmath20 is the image circumference of cylindrical lattice sheet .",
    "we then introduce a screw vector @xmath21 with integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the largest common divisor of the integer pair @xmath26 . exactly following refs   and ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 constitute the basic ingredients of the generalized motif cell , upon which a generalized screw operation @xmath29 and a generalized @xmath25-fold rotation operation @xmath30 can be established .",
    "the former is a rotation @xmath31 around the tube axis with a simultaneous translation @xmath32 along the tube axis , the latter a rotation of @xmath33 around the tube axis .",
    "a generalized motif cell @xmath34 can be generated from the @xmath35 cell by successive operations of @xmath36 and @xmath30 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 times respectively .",
    "for the in - cell geometry of a generalized motif cell , originated from atom @xmath11 the position of atom @xmath18 can be fixed by a rotation @xmath39 around the tube axis and two simultaneous translations @xmath40 and @xmath41 along the tube axis and the tube radius respectively .    as a result ,",
    "the coordinates on the cylindrical lattice sheet for each site @xmath42 with @xmath43 can be expressed as @xmath44 while the corresponding coordinates in the image plane have the form as @xmath45 with the @xmath10-components of both @xmath11 and @xmath18 atoms as constants respectively .",
    "therefore , the six gmv s @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 provide a complete description for the geometry of the lattice structure of swcnt s , in which all the @xmath11 and @xmath18 atoms are allowed to sit on different cylindrical surfaces with radii @xmath13 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "in fact , in sense of quadratic approximation the vibration potential of the single layer graphite lattice sheet provides a proper description of various modalities of lattice motion .",
    "we , therefore , propose that the total potential energy of swcnt s can be extracted from the vibration potential of graphene lattice sheet@xcite as follows .",
    "firstly , the total potential energy contributed by carbon atom 1 , i.e. , atom @xmath48 , is composed of the following five terms in which a local planar graphene sheet is taken as the reference point , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the potentials of the spring forces between the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor atom pair respectively as shown in fig .",

    "the redundant counting in the total potential energy contributed by different carbon atoms can be accounted by a proper resetting for the values of the relevant force constants .",
    "we further address that this sort of parameterization procedure can be carried out for all kinds of swcnt s including both chiral and achiral tubes .",

    "the frontal five force constants come from vibration energy of planar graphene sheet@xcite . since the twisting deformations increase substantially with decreasing the tube diameters , for example the twisting angle for the c - c bond can take the value as large as @xmath87 for the narrow swcnt @xmath88 , an additional force constant for the anharmonic improvement as @xmath89 in eq .",

    "this is because that the total energy @xmath96 keeps unchanged when the tube is rotated upside down with atoms @xmath11 and @xmath18 mutually permuted , so that the optimized geometry must exhibit the @xmath65 symmetry .",

    "[ fig : young ] for two species swcnt s : armchair tubes @xmath101 , and zigzag tubes @xmath102 .",
    "it shows clearly that the young s modulus of armchair tubes decreases with increasing of tube diameter and always takes the values larger than that of planar graphite .",
    "while for zigzag tubes it exhibits a contrary behavior , i.e. , increases with increasing diameter and keeps its value always below that of graphene sheet .",
    "it was reported in ref .",
    "that among 27 samples of carbon nanotubes , some of them are measured with the young s modulus higher than that of bulk graphite .",
    "while , to our knowledge , most of the exiting theoretical estimations@xcite can only provide values of young s modulus less than that of graphene sheet for any kind of swcnt s .",
    "our calculation provides an evidence that armchair tubes are stiffer while the zigzag softer due to the chirality - dependence .    [ 0.8 ]    it is known that following the elasticity theory of the continuum medium , the young s modulus as well as poisson ratio can be derived from the relevant sound velocities,@xcite @xmath103 @xmath104 where the two expressions are also referred to the boundary condition of only the @xmath105 component of stress tensor being non - zero .",
    "therefore , we may calculate the young s modulus and poisson ratio from the relevant sound velocities obtained in the last section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : young ] for comparison .",
    "we emphasize that the young s modulus ( poisson ratio ) calculated from the strain energy following eqs  ( [ eq : younge ] ) and  ( [ eq : poissone ] ) and those calculated from the sound velocities following eqs  ( [ eq : youngv ] ) and  ( [ eq : poissonv ] ) are essentially two distinct independent calculations .",
    "the former is in sense of a microscopic calculation following from the total potential energy eqs  ( [ potential1])([potential5 ] ) , while the latter is a sort of macroscopic calculation with the sound velocities as its input although which is provided by the microscopic vibrational energy ( introduced in section iii ) .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : young ] , for each of the two species of swcnt @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the young s module produced by the two kinds of calculations meet to each other closer and closer as the radius increases and have the correct @xmath106 limit as the experimental young s modulus of graphite .",
    "such a result arises from the intrinsic consistency between our total potential energy expression and that of the vibrational energy .",
    "the difference between the two kinds of calculations becomes apparent when tube radius decreases .",
    "we understand such a phenomenon as that the calculation following from the theory of elasticity is macroscopic in nature which would be failure for ultra narrow tubes .",
    "we show the calculated poisson ratios for armchair @xmath101 and zigzag @xmath102 tubes in fig .",
    "[ fig : poisson ] as the function of radius .",
    "the values of the poisson ratio are in an order as that those of zigzag are the largest and the armchair the smallest .",
    "this is consistent with the correspondent result of _ ab initio _",
    "in this paper , we proposed a lattice dynamic treatment for the total potential energy for swcnt s which is , apart from a parameter for the non - linear effects , extracted from the vibrational energy of the planar graphene sheet .",
    "based upon the proposal , we investigated systematically the relaxed lattice configuration for narrow swcnt s , the strain energy , the young s modulus and poisson ratio , as well as the lattice vibrational properties respected to the relaxed equilibrium tubule structure with the same set of force constants independent of tube structures . in particular , with the application of gmv s we not only successfully extend the locally introduced - total potential energy to the whole tube , but also make the lattice dynamics for swcnt s with relaxed geometry becomes treatable . comparing with the corresponding results obtained from the tubes with ideal geometry , we verified that the relaxation effect brings the bond length longer and the frequencies of various optical vibrational modes softer .",
    "moreover , our approach not only deduces the proper large diameter limit values of young s modulus and poisson ratio , but also provides a strong evidence that swcnt s with different chirality could be stiffer or softer than the planar graphene sheet .",
    "the calculated rbm and optical modes in tubule tangential plane are also in good agreement with the experimental measurements . in addition , we realized that the chiral symmetry - based general expansion formulae for different physical quantities survive for swcnt s with relaxed geometry in the sense to replace the chiral angle by its counterpart defined in tubes of ideal geometry .",

    "<S> in this paper , we proposed a lattice dynamic treatment for the total potential energy for single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnt s ) which is , apart from a parameter for the non - linear effects , extracted from the vibrational energy of the planar graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the energetics , elasticity and lattice dynamics are treated in terms of the same set of force constants independent of tube structures . based upon the proposal , </S>",
    "<S> we investigated systematically the relaxed lattice configuration for narrow swcnt s , the strain energy , the young s modulus and poisson ratio , and the lattice vibrational properties respected to the relaxed equilibrium tubule structure . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results for various physical quantities are nicely in consistency with existing experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we verified that the relaxation effect brings the bond length longer and the frequencies of various optical vibrational modes softer ; our calculation provides an evidence that the young s modulus of armchair tube exceeds that of the planar graphene sheet , and the large diameter limits of the young s modulus and poisson ratio are in agreement with the experimental values of the graphite ; the calculated radial breathing modes for the ultra narrow tubes with diameter range between 0.2 - 0.5  nm coincide the experimental results and the existing _ ab initio _ calculations with satisfaction ; for narrow tubes of diameter 2  nm , the calculated frequencies of optical modes in tubule tangential plane as well as those of radial breathing modes are also in good agreement with the experimental measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our calculation shows that various physical quantities of relaxed swcnt s can actually be expanded in terms of the chiral angle defined for the correspondent ideal swcnt s . </S>"
