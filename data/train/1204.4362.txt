    "the discrete and small scale component of the solar magnetic field is revealed in the high spatial resolution observations of the sun .",

    "high cadence observations and studies show that magnetic bps are highly dynamic and intermittent in nature , randomly moving in the dark inter - granular lanes .",
    "these motions are mainly due to the buffeting of granules .",
    "the smf is passively advected to the boundaries of supergranules creating the magnetic network in the photosphere .",
    "earlier works by several authors have reported mean rms velocities of magnetic elements in the order of a few km s@xmath6 . with the ground based observations of the granules at 5750    ( white light ) ,   have identified many network bps with turbulent proper motion and a mean speed of 1.4 km s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite have used _",
    "g_-band observations of the photosphere and found that the _ g_-band bps move in the intergranular lanes at speeds from 0.5 to 5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite observed the flowfield properties of the photosphere by comparing the magnetic network and nonmagnetic quiet sun .",
    "they show that the convective flow structures are smaller and much more chaotic in magnetic region , with a mean speed of 1.47 km s@xmath6 for the tracked magnetic bps . with the _ g_-band and continuum filtergrams ,",
    "@xcite used an object tracking technique and determined the autocorrelation function describing the temporal variation of the bright point velocity , with a correlation time of about 100 s. correcting for measurements errors ,  @xcite measured a 0.89 km s@xmath6 rms velocity of bps .",
    "advances in the ground based observations like rapid high cadence sequences with improved adaptive optics to minimize seeing effects , and also the space based observations at high resolutions , continued to attract many authors to pursue bp motion studies . for example ,   used space based _ hinode _ _ g_-band images to measure bp velocities and their lifetime .",
    "the bp motions can be used to measure dynamic properties of magnetic flux tubes and their interaction with granular plasma .",
    "photospheric turbulent diffusion is one such dynamical aspect that can be derived consequently from the bp random walk .",
    "measured a diffusion constant of 195 km@xmath1 s@xmath6 from the bp random walk and their dispersion .",
    "@xcite studied photospheric diffusion at a cadence of 10 s with high resolution tio observations of a quiet sun area .",
    "they found a super - diffusion regime , satisfying a power law of diffusion with an index @xmath9 , which is pronounced in the time intervals @xmath10 s.    the implications of these magnetic random walk motions have been found very fruitful recently .",
    "such motions are capable of launching magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves  , which are potential candidates for explaining the high temperatures observed in the solar chromosphere and corona .",
    "for example , a three - dimensional mhd model developed by  @xcite suggests that random motions inside bps can create alfvn wave turbulence , which dissipates the waves in a coronal loop  ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations by  @xcite provide strong evidence that the alfvnic waves ( which are probably generated by the bp motions ) , have sufficient energy to heat the quiet solar corona . to test theories of chromospheric and coronal heating , more precise measurements of the",
    "velocities and power spectra of bp motions are needed .",
    "@xcite worked on the precise measurements of bp positions , taking into account the measurement errors .",
    "the auto - correlations derived by them for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of the bp velocity using high spatial resolution and moderate cadence of 30 s observations gave a correlation time of about 60 s , which is twice the cadence of the observations .",
    "this suggests an over - estimation of correlation time and an under - estimation of the rms velocity power , with a significant hidden power in the time scales less than 30 s , and thus warranting for observations at even higher cadence .",
    "this is important because , the measured power profile , which is the fourier transform of the auto - correlation function , gives us an estimation of the velocity amplitudes and energy flux carried by the waves that are generated by the bp motions in various and especially at higher frequencies .    in this study",
    ", we use 5 s cadence wideband h@xmath0 observations from the swedish 1-m solar telescope to track the bps and measure their rms velocities . for comparison",
    ", we also use a 30 s cadence _ g_-band observational sequence from solar optical telescope onboard _",
    "these independent and complementary results take us closer to what could be the true rms velocity and power profile of the lateral motions of the bps .",
    "the details of the datasets used , analysis procedure , results and their implications are discussed in the following sections .",
    "in this study , we have analyzed time sequence of intensity filtergrams with 5 and 30 s cadence . a brief description of the observations is given below .",

    ": these observations were obtained on 18 june 2006 , with the _ swedish 1-m solar telescope _ ( _ sst _ ; scharmer et al .",

    "here we analyze images from the wideband channel of the solar optical universal polarimeter  ( soup ; * ? ? ? * ) which received 10% of the light before the soup tunable filter but after the soup prefilter  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the optical setup of the instrument ) .",
    "the prefilter was an fwhm@xmath158   wide interference filter centered on the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the soup filter was tuned to the blue wing of h@xmath0 at -450 m  but that data is not considered here . on the wideband channel",
    "there were 2 cameras ( running at 37 frames per sec ) positioned as phase - diversity pair  one in focus and one camera 13.5 mm out of focus .",
    "the data from the two cameras has been processed with the momfbd restoration method in sets of 5 seconds , creating a 5 s cadence time sequence with a total of 720 images .",

    "furthermore , the images were aligned using cross - correlation on a large area of the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the images were then clipped to @xmath16 pixels ( with  @xmath17 per pixel ) , to keep the common fov ( the ccds have @xmath18 pixels , some pixels are lost after alignment between focus and defocus cameras ) .    for a reference direction , the solar north in the _ sst _",

    "the observations were made for a duration of 4 hr , with a 30 s cadence in a fov of @xmath19 (  @xmath20 per pixel ; 1024 pixels in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions ) , near disk center .",
    "the images were processed using standard procedures available in the _ solarsoft _ library .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the method of determining the bp positions , and the velocity measurements through the correlation tracking .",
    "we manually select the bps to estimate their position to a sub - pixel accuracy .",
    "we consider the coordinates of maximum intensity of a given bp to be the position of that bp and the method for measuring these positions involves two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we visually identify a bp and it is selected for analysis for a period during which it is clearly distinguishable from the surrounding granules . on an average",
    ", we follow a bp for about @xmath23 min . the bps with elongated shapes are not considered for the analysis . also , we stop following a bp if it is substantially distorted or elongated from its initial shape . though time consuming , manual selection gives a handle on the validity of the positional accuracy of a bp from frame to frame . at each time step , using a cursor , an approximate location ( @xmath24 ) of a particular bp is fed to an automated procedure to get its accurate position , which is step two in our method .",
    "step two is completely an automated procedure .",
    "here , we use a surface interpolation technique to get a precise position of that bp ( to a sub - pixel accuracy ) .",
    "approximate position from the previous step is used to construct a grid of @xmath25 pixels covering the full bp ( with ( @xmath24 ) as the center of that grid ) .",
    "now , our procedure fits a 2-d , @xmath26 degree surface polynomial to that grid ( using @xmath27 , an idl procedure ) ; interpolates the fit to one - hundredth of a pixel ; returns the fine location of its peak ( @xmath28 ) within that grid and finally stores the accurate position ( @xmath29 ) of that bp ( which is the sum of its approximate and fine positions ( @xmath30 ) ) , for further analysis .",
    "therefore , the position of a bp with index @xmath31 in a frame @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 and all the coordinates till this point are relative to the lower left corner of the image .",
    "though the positional measurements of bps as described in section  [ positions ] are accurate , they can not be directly used to measure the velocities as there are artificial velocity sources viz .",
    "the instrumental drifts , seeing variations , jittery motions and also the solar rotation , which vectorially add to bp velocities and thus are required to be removed from the analysis . while _ hinode _",
    "( space based ) data is not subjected to seeing variations , _ sst _",
    "( ground based ) data has been corrected for seeing as described in section  [ data ] .",
    "further , we need to correct for instrumental drifts , jitters and solar rotation . calculating the offsets between the successive images",
    "is necessary to remove these artificial velocities . in this section ,",
    "we describe the method of our cross correlation analysis used to co - align the images .",
    "cross correlation ( @xmath34 ) of two images @xmath35 and @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 where , @xmath38 [ @xmath39 and @xmath40 [ @xmath41 are mean value and standard deviation of @xmath42 [ @xmath36 ] respectively , @xmath44 is the number of pixels in each image , for normalization . with the above definition of cross correlation , to get the offsets between two images , we need to shift one image with respect to the other ( in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions ) and find at what offsets ( independent in @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) the correlation function attains the maximum value . in general , for shifts of @xmath45 to @xmath46 , the cross correlation is a 2-d function with @xmath47 rows and columns .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the coarse offsets between the two images in @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions , respectively , such that the cross correlation reaches its maximum value : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . to get the sub - pixel offsets , the fine offsets ( @xmath52 ) are calculated .",
    "the method is similar to finding the fine position of bp by using a @xmath25 pixel grid but now about ( @xmath53 ) of @xmath34 .",
    "instead of cross correlating every successive image with its previous one , we keep a reference image for about 200 s , i.e. , a frame @xmath32 taken at time @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is used as a reference for the subsequent frames till @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) for cross correlation . therefore the _ 5 sec _ ( _ sst _ ) and the _ 30 sec _ (",
    "_ hinode _ ) data have about 40 and 7 images respectively in each set . by keeping the last image of a set equal to the first image in its next set",
    ", we can co - align different sets . in this way",
    ", the accumulation of errors in the offsets can be minimized .    with the above background on co - aligning images to find various drifts , we present the results of drifts found in _ hinode _ data . as an illustration",
    ", we divide the full ( i.e. , @xmath58  hr ) _ hinode _ time sequence into 4 quadrants with @xmath59  hr each .",
    "further , we do correlation tracking ( as described above by keeping 7 frames per set ) on each quadrant separately and plot the results in figure  [ drifts ] .",
    "the four dashed lines in the left and the right panels are the offsets in @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions respectively , the thick dashed line in each panel is the average of the offsets ( i.e. , average of four dashed lines ) , and the solid red curve is the offset obtained by considering the full fov .",
    "clearly , in each quadrant , the offsets have a trend similar to that of the full fov ( solid red curve ) and an additional component of their own .",
    "this additional component is probably the real velocity on the sun due to flows with varying length scales ( for example , super - granular , meso - granular and granular ) and with flow directions changing over areas of a few tens of arcsec@xmath1 on the sun .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in the dynamics of the bps relative to their _ local _ surroundings , as granulation flows will have a dominant effect on the bp velocities and their variations on short time scales .",
    "hence , we consider a @xmath60 area about the bp as a reference frame for that bp ( i.e. , keeping the bp in the center of the @xmath61 area ) .",
    "the cross correlation is performed on this @xmath60 area instead of the full fov to get the offsets , which are subtracted from the @xmath62 .",
    "the bp positions corrected for offsets are now given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the @xmath61 area of bp@xmath65 .",
    "in the case of the _ sst _ data , the observations are off disk center at @xmath66 , which corresponds to a heliocentric angle of @xmath67 .",
    "this will introduce a projection effect on the measured horizontal velocities in both @xmath68 and @xmath69 directions and needs to be corrected . to do this ,",
    "the coordinate system @xmath70 defined by the original _ sst _ observations , is rotated by @xmath71 in the anti - clockwise direction .",
    "now the image plane is oriented in e - w ( parallel to equator , new @xmath11 ) and n - s ( new @xmath12 ) directions .",
    "further , the e - w coordinate is multiplied by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "hence the new coordinate system @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 _ sst _ bp positions @xmath75 , as measured from equation  , are remapped to @xmath76 , using the above coordinate transformations for the remapped @xmath70 of _ sst _ and @xmath73 of _ hinode_. ] .",
    "in this section , we present various results in detail giving more emphasis on the _ sst _ results .",
    "we have selected 97 _ sst _ bps with @xmath773800 individual velocity measurements .",
    "figure  [ track ] shows the paths of four individual _ sst _ bps .",
    "some of the bps move in a relatively smoother path while some exhibit very random motions to the shortest time steps available .",
    "bps drift about a few hundred km in a few minutes .",
    "the instantaneous velocity @xmath78 of a bp is given by @xmath79 , multiplied by a factor to convert the units of measured velocity to km s@xmath6 ( 9.4 in case of _ sst _ which is , image scale of _ sst _ in km divided by the time cadence in sec ) .",
    "figure  [ vel ] shows the plot of such velocities as a function of time for bp#3 ( path of bp#3 is shown in the lower left panel of figure  [ track ] ) .",
    "usually , the changes in the velocity are gradual in time but , sometimes we do see sudden and large changes in the magnitude and direction of the velocity ( for example at 1 min in @xmath80 and at 2 min in @xmath81 in figure  [ vel ] ) . note that a large change of velocity of one sign is followed immediately by a change of the opposite sign , so the net change in position is not very large .",
    "this suggest that these changes are due to errors in the positional measurements .",
    "a position error at one time will affect the velocities in the intervals immediately before and after that time . in the following",
    "we will assume that such changes in velocity are due to measurement errors .",
    "however , we can not rule out that some of these changes are due to real motions on the sun on a time scales less than 5 seconds .",
    "the means and standard deviations of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ( first line ) .",
    "histograms of the distribution of velocities @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are shown in figure  [ hist ] ( panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively ) .",
    "solid lines in panels ( a ) and ( b ) are gaussian fits to the histograms with _ raw _ standard deviations ( @xmath83 ) of 1.32 and 1.22 km s@xmath6 .",
    "a scatter plot of @xmath80 against @xmath81 is shown in panel ( d ) , which is symmetric in the @xmath84space . however ,",
    "a small non - zero and positive mean velocity of about 0.2 km s@xmath6 is noticed , suggesting that there is a net bp velocity with respect to the 5 arcsec boxes that we used as reference frames .",
    "values of the mean and rms velocities as determined from the fits are also listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ( second line ) .",
    "these distributions are a mix of both true velocities and measurement errors .",
    "we can gain more insight into the the dynamical aspects of the bp motions by studying their observed velocity correlation function @xmath85 , defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the auto - correlations , and @xmath89 is the cross - correlation of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath90 is the index of the delay time .",
    "@xmath91 denotes the average over all values of the time index @xmath32 and bp index @xmath31 but for a fixed value of @xmath90 .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ auto ] .",
    "top left and right panels are the plots of @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "black curves are for the _ sst _ whereas the red curves show the _ hinode _ results for comparison",
    ". both the _ sst _ and _ hinode _ results are consistent for delay times @xmath94 min .",
    "however , the _ hinode _ auto - correlations quickly fall to lower values .",
    "this is mainly a statistical error , since we do not have a large number of measurements in the case of _",
    "hinode_. focusing on periods @xmath94 min ,",
    "it is clear from the auto - correlation plots that the core of the _ hinode _ data within @xmath95 s delay time , which is sampled with three data points is now well resolved with the aid of the _ sst _ data .",
    "also , at shorter times , @xmath96 takes a cusp - like profile . extrapolating this to delay times of the order of 1 s",
    ", we expect to see a steep increase in the rms velocities of the bp motions .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the cross - correlation as function of delay time .",
    "the _ sst _",
    "data show a small but a consistent and overall negative @xmath97 while the _ hinode _ data show a small positive correlation .",
    "we suggest that the real cross - correlation @xmath98 , and that the measured values are due to a small number of measurements with high velocities ( largely exceeding the rms values ) .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ auto ] shows the number of measurements @xmath99 used in the correlation analysis for both the _ sst _ and _ hinode _ data . to obtain good statistics we collected enough bp measurements to ensure that @xmath100 for all bins .",
    "in the rest of the section , we describe the method of estimating the errors in the velocity measurements due to positional uncertainties by analyzing @xmath85 . following  @xcite",
    ", we assume that the errors in the positions are uncorrelated from frame to frame and randomly distributed with a standard deviation of @xmath101 .",
    "since the velocities are computed by taking simple differences between position measurements ( see above ) , the measurement errors increase the observed velocity correlation at @xmath102 by @xmath103 ( error ) , and reduce the correlations at @xmath104 by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the cadence ( see equation 3 in their paper ) .",
    "we define @xmath108 which is valid only with our two - point formula for the velocity .",
    "once @xmath103 is determined , the rms values ( @xmath109 ) of the true solar velocities can be measured as @xmath110 .    a previous study using data from the _ swedish vacuum solar telescope _",
    "@xcite assumed @xmath85 to be a lorentzian . here",
    ", we clearly see that @xmath85 differs from a lorentzian , and it can be fitted with a function @xmath111 , which is a sum of the true correlation of solar origin ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath103 , given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a generalized lorentzian .",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath115 ( correlation time ) , and @xmath116 ( exponent ) are the free parameters of the fit ; @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the functions of @xmath119 , which are determined analytically by least square minimization ( see appendix  [ app : appen ] ) .",
    "we also bring to the notice of the reader that our formula for @xmath111 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath120 .",
    "however , there is an unexplained increase in the observed @xmath93 beyond @xmath121 s ( panel ( b ) in figure  [ auto ] ) . to eliminate any spurious results due to this anomaly",
    ", we use a maximum delay time of @xmath122 s to fit @xmath96 with @xmath111 by minimizing the sum of the squares of their difference , as defined in equation  .",

    "@xmath123 is a well bounded function for @xmath127 , confirming a cusp - like profile .",
    "the correlation time is @xmath7 s , which is about @xmath128 _ times _ the time cadence .",
    "taking into account the variance in errors ( i.e. , @xmath129 km@xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , we get @xmath130 km , and the corrected rms velocities ( @xmath109 ) of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are now 1.00 and 0.86 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these results are plotted as dashed curves in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ hist ] , and the values are tabulated in the last row of table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the corrected distribution of @xmath131 is shown as a dashed rayleigh distribution in panel ( c ) . with higher cadence observations , these results can be refined and modified , as @xmath119 depend on the shape of the core of @xmath96 . by comparing the _ sst _ and _ hinode _ results",
    ", we expect that the observed @xmath96 probably increases rapidly below 5 s and thus changing the set of parameters to some extent .",
    "we studied the proper motions of the bps using the wideband h@xmath0 observations from the _ sst _ and the _ g_-band data from _",
    "hinode_. bps are manually selected and tracked using @xmath60 areas surrounding them as reference frames . the quality of the _ sst _ observations allowed us to measure the bp positions to a sub - pixel accuracy with an uncertainty of only 3 km , which is at least seven times better than the value reported by  @xcite , and comparable to the rms value of 2.7 km due to image jittering reported by  @xcite .",
    "they adopted this rms value of 2.7 km as a typical error of calculations of the bp position .",
    "we found that the horizontal motions of the bps in @xmath21 and @xmath22 are gaussian distributions with _ raw _ ( including the true signal and measurement errors ) rms velocities of 1.32 and 1.22 km s@xmath6 , symmetric in @xmath84space , observed at 5 s cadence .",
    "the above estimate of the measurement uncertainty is obtained from a detailed analysis of the velocity auto - correlation functions . for this , we fitted the observed @xmath85 with @xmath111 , a function of the form shown in equation  , and estimated an rms error of about 0.87 km s@xmath6 in @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the removal of this error makes the @xmath80 and @xmath81 gaussians narrower with new standard deviations 1.00 and 0.86 km s@xmath6 ( a fractional change of 30% ) .",
    "the total rms velocity ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 combined ) is 1.32 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the correlation time is found to be in the range of @xmath7 s.    following is a brief note and discussion on the additional results we derive from our work .",
    "bps are advected by the photospheric flows .",
    "thus , taking these features as tracers , we can derive the diffusion parameters of the plasma .",
    "as bps usually have life times of the order of minutes , the motion of these features can be used to study the nature of photospheric diffusion at short time scales .",
    "the mean squared displacement of bps @xmath132 as function of time is a measure of diffusion .",
    "it is suggested in the literature that @xmath132 can be approximated as a power law with an index @xmath133  ( i.e. , @xmath134 , see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ diffusion ]",
    ", we plot the observed @xmath132 ( symbols ) , for the 200 s interval on a log - log scale . solid line is the least square fit with a slope of 1.59 , which is consistent with the value @xmath9 found by  @xcite for quiet sun . despite the differences in the observations ( instruments and observed wavelengths ) , and analysis methods ( identification and tracking of bps ) ,",
    "a close agreement in the independently estimated @xmath133 suggests that this is a real solar signal .",
    "both these results assert the presence of super - diffusion ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) , for time intervals less than 300 s. since most of the bps in this study are tracked for only @xmath136 min , we can not comment on the diffusion at longer times .",
    "note that there is a general relationship between the mean squared displacement @xmath132 and the velocity auto - correlation function @xmath112 @xmath137 where we assume isotropy of the bp motions ( @xmath138 ) . for",
    "a known auto - correlation or mean squared displacement , the other quantity can be derived using the above relation .",
    "we already saw that the horizontal motions of the bps yield several important properties of the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "one more such important property is the possibility of the generation of alfvn waves due to these motions .",
    "here we qualitatively estimate and compare the power spectrum of horizontal motions as a function of frequency for two forms of the velocity correlation function : ( a ) the form @xmath112 ( equation  ) , obtained in this study , and ( b ) a lorentzian function .",

    "we observe that for frequencies exceeding 0.02 hz ( @xmath142 50 s ) , the horizontal motions generally have more power in case ( a ) as compared to case ( b ) .",
    "this highlights the fact that the dynamics of the bps at short time scales are very important .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to do these observations and calculations at very high cadence .",
    "the measurements presented in this paper provide important constraints of models for alfvn and kink wave generation in solar magnetic flux tubes .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , such waves may play an important role in chromospheric and coronal heating . in the alfvn wave turbulence model",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic field lines are moved about with rms velocity of 1.5 km s@xmath6 , similar to the rms velocity of 1.32 km s@xmath6 found here .",
    "however , the models include only the internal motions of a flux tube , whereas the observations refer to the displacements of the flux tube as a whole . clearly , to make more direct comparisons between models and observations will require imaging with high spatial resolution ( @xmath142 0.1 arcsec )",
    ". this may be possible in the future with the advanced technology solar telescope .",
    "in this work we presented the results of the bp motions , some of their implications and use in the context of photospheric diffusion and coronal wave heating mechanisms .",
    "we interpret the location of the intensity maximum of a bp as its position at any given time .",
    "this is certainly plausible for time periods when we begin to see the physical motion of a bp as a _ rigid body _ due to the action of the convection on the flux tubes .",
    "but at timescales shorter than one minute , other interpretations are also plausible : the motions marked by the intensity maxima could be intensity fluctuations in an otherwise static bp",
    ". nevertheless , these fluctuations are manifestations of some disturbances inside the bp , which are equally important and interesting to explore further .",
