    "these include chiral dynamics ( treating soft pions , chiral solitons , and possibly parity doubling in spectra @xcite ) , heavy quark symmetry ( describing hadrons with one charm or beauty quark as qcd `` hydrogen '' or `` deuterium '' atoms ) , studies of correlations among quarks @xcite and new states they imply ( such as a weakly decaying @xmath3 state @xcite ) , potential descriptions ( including relativistic and coupled - channel descriptions ) , and qcd sum rules .",
