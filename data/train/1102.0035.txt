    "<S> we present a microscopic theory of a lateral quantum dot molecule in a radial magnetic field with a greenberger- horne- zeilinger ( ghz ) maximally entangled three particle groundstate . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot molecule consists of three quantum dots with one electron spin each forming a central equilateral triangle . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction is changed to the ferromagnetic interaction by additional doubly occupied quantum dots , one dot near each side of a triangle . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is provided by micro - magnets . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction among the electrons is described within an extended hubbard hamiltonian and electronic states are obtained using configuration interaction approach . </S>",
    "<S> the set of parameters is established for which the ground state of the molecule in a radial magnetic field is well approximated by a ghz state . </S>"
