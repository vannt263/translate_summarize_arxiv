    "compounding continuous with discrete distributions have been introduced and studied in the recent years .",
    "these method allow us to obtain distributions with great flexibility and are useful to develop more realistic statistical models in a great variety of applications .",
    "@xcite introduced a class of distributions which can be obtained by minimum and maximum of independent and identically distributed continuous random variables , where the sample size follows geometric distribution .",
    "@xcite introduced a class of distributions obtained by mixing extended weibull and power series distributions and studied several of its statistical properties .",
    "this class contains the weibull - geometric distribution @xcite and other lifetime models studied recently .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a brief literature review about some univariate distributions obtained by compounding .",
    "the three - parameter generalized linear failure rate ( glfr ) distribution has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "the hazard function of glfr distribution can be increasing , decreasing and bathtub shaped , and it has the following cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and probability density function ( pdf ) , respectively , @xmath0    recently , many studies have been done on glfr distribution , and some authors have extended it : the generalized linear exponential @xcite , beta - linear failure rate @xcite , kumaraswamy - glfr @xcite , modified - glfr @xcite , mcdonald - glfr @xcite , poisson - glfr @xcite , glfr - geometric @xcite and glfr - power series @xcite are some univariate extension of glfr distribution .",
    "@xcite have introduced a new bivariate distribution using the glfr distribution and derived several interesting properties of this new bivariate distribution .",
    "the proposed bivariate glfr ( bglfr ) distribution is an extension of bivariate generalized exponential ( bge ) distribution @xcite and its cdf , the joint pdf and the joint survival distribution function are in closed forms .",
    "this bivariate distribution has both an absolute continuous part and a singular part , and is extended to a multivariate distribution .",
    "the cdf of the bglfr model is given by @xmath1    in this paper , we compound the bglfr distribution and power series class of distributions and define a new class of bivariate distributions .",
    "this class contains the bglfr and glfr - power series ( glfrps ) distributions and is called the bivariate glfr - power series ( bglfrps ) class of distributions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.class ]",
    ", we introduce the bglfrps distributions and obtain some properties of this new family .",

    "an em algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters in section [ sec.est ] .",
    "a real data application of the bglfrps distributions is illustrated in section [ sec.exa ] .",
