    "* )    for the last ten years the 6.4 kev intensity of sgr b2 has dropped down in about three times in comparison with its maximum value in 2000 ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the background 6.4 kev emission for e.g. the cloud sgr b2",
    "is expected to be seen in several years when the front of primary sgr a * photons leaves finally the cloud .",
    "does it mean that in several years the line flux from sgr b2 will drop down to zero ?",
    "the 6.4 kev emission from the gc clouds can also be provided by cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "three aspects of the alternative iron line production by crs have to be clarified :    * it is known that the gc medium is filled by relatively low energy crs .",
    "as @xcite showed , crs of mev energies ionize the interstellar gas and are absorbed there .",
    "the density of these crs in the gc can be derived from measurements of the absorption line of the ionised molecular hydrogen ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , @xcite and @xcite found an unusually high ionization rate in the gc , which is not observed in other parts of the galactic disk .",
    "the ionization rate , @xmath2 , is almost uniform throughout of the gc on scales about 200 pc , @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "this suggests a single and widespread mechanism of ionization there .",
    "then the question is what is the level of the 6.4 kev line emission produced by these mev crs .",
    "alternatively , the background flux of the 6.4 kev line in the gc can also be provided by a hypothetic injection of subrelativistic protons by a star accretion onto the central black hole ( see * ? ? ?",
    "they estimated this flux for the molecular cloud sgr b2 and found that in several years it might be about 15% of the maximum observed in 2000 .",
    "of course , these predictions are strongly model dependent and can not be considered as reliable ; * the line emission from several clouds like the arches cluster region , sgr c , g0.162 - 0.217 , go.11 - 0.11 and others ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is unlikely due to photoionization because e.g. some of them do not show any time variability as expected in the photoionization model .",
    "the question is whether the line flux from these clouds is produced by background crs or by crs from local sources ; * although the photon origin of the 6.4 kev line emission is widely accepted , @xcite developed a model of the line production by relativistic electrons which explained also the flux time variability from the gc clouds .",

    "this conclusion is in a full agreement with results obtained by @xcite ( see fig . 1 in that paper ) .",

    "a nice example is the molecular cloud nearby the arches cluster whose 6.4 kev emission may be generated by crs .",

    "it seems incredible that this simultaneous variability is due to independent local sources of electrons nearby the clouds . from the variability correlation",

    "however , we can not exclude ( rather arbitrarily ) an upturn of the injection spectrum of electrons in the range below 1 gev",
    ". then one may expect a higher ionization rate in the gc than estimated in section 5 . in any case , the local electron spectrum near a very compact region nearby the cloud go.13 - 013 derived by @xcite from the radio data from 74 to 327 mhz , @xmath157 , is much steeper than derived by @xcite from the diffuse radio emission in the gc .",
    "the analysis of @xcite showed strong spatial variations of the electron spectral index in this region , and it is unlikely to assume this spectrum in the whole gc region ; * in our opinion another problem of the electron interpretation is a relatively high luminosity of electrons needed for hydrogen ionization in the gc region .",
    "as @xcite showed the energy supply of electrons necessary for the 6.4 kev line flux from the gc is about @xmath158 erg s@xmath4 that is one order of magnitude higher than the total cr luminosity in the galaxy and three orders of magnitude higher than the total electron luminosity of the galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it seems that there are no known sources which are able to sustain such an electron population throughout the central molecular zone ( cmz ) ; * we do not exclude that local sources of electrons may provide an excesses of the 6.4 kev line emission in some molecular clouds and even reproduce a relatively short time variations of the iron line emission ( @xmath159 yr ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if interpretation of the 6.4 kev time variability of e.g @xcite is correct , then the electron model is unable to reproduce the simultaneous short time variability of the iron line emission from clouds which are distant from each other by  hundred pc .",
    "alternatively we can speculate that a random distribution of local electron sources could also provide the necessary effect of the line variations in different clouds that are seen by chance .",
    "however , this interpretation seems to be very unlikely . * in our opinion the photon model of @xcite reproduces naturally these spatial and temporal characteristics of the 6.4 kev emission in the gc .",
    "the photon model has two important advantages : the front of primary photons occupies a very extended region 100 yr after the explosion , and its spatial distribution may have very sharp leading and back fronts that reproduces easily the 10 yr temporal variations of the 6.4 kev emission from gc molecular clouds .",
