    "since the introduction of the standard circuit model @xcite , many new models of quantum computation @xcite have been developed .",
    "inspired by feynman s ideas about how to use quantum systems to simulate reversible computation @xcite , a class of ` analog ' hamiltonian quantum computing models computing is based on time evolution with time - independent or slowly changing hamiltonians . the basic idea is to encode the progress of a quantum computation @xmath3 ( a quantum circuit composed of a sequence of local unitaries ) with @xmath0 gates @xmath4 on an initial state @xmath5 into a _ history state _ of a system with two registers @xmath6 as @xmath7    first , one can now look for a simple hamiltonian with as its ground state .",
    "finding the ground state of such a hamiltonian , measuring its clock register and obtaining the result @xmath0 would then allow us to obtain @xmath8 , the result of the quantum circuit @xmath3 applied to the initial state @xmath9 of the work register .",
    "this approach produced many results about the quantum complexity ( in particular , @xmath10-completeness ) of finding the ground state properties of simple hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "a second direction of investigation in these models @xcite is to look at the hamiltonian dynamics instead of the static ground state properties .",
    "the hamiltonians in these _ hamiltonian quantum computing _ ( hqc )",
    "models generate schrdinger time evolution which brings an easily - prepared initial state towards the history state or its variants . as we show in section [ clocksection ]",
    ", one can extract the result of the computation @xmath11 from the final state with high probability .",
    "this results in @xmath12 universality  any problem which is efficiently solvable on a quantum computer can be solved in the hqc model as well .",
    "another example utilizing the preparation of the state is the result of aharonov et .",
    "@xcite , showing that adiabatic quantum computation @xcite is polynomially equivalent to the standard circuit model .    in this paper , we take the second point of view , focusing on the universality of the dynamical properties of a class of hamiltonians .",
    "the desirable properties for such a hqc model are low locality ( a hamiltonian composed of terms which act nontrivially on a few qubits at a time ) , a simple geometry of interactions , low dimensionality of particles involved ( qubits or qudits ) , time invariance ( or slow change with time ) , translational - invariance and a large eigenvalue gap above the ground state energy ( or above the computational subspace ) to protect the computation against decoherence .",
    "we achieve this last property by using a _ frustration - free _ hamiltonian  a sum of positive semidefinite terms , whose ground state is the common ground state of all the terms .    our goal is to find a universal hqc with a low locality of interactions , using a hamiltonian that is time - independent and frustration - free .",
    "feynman s original construction requires 4-local terms ( see section [ clocksection ] for details ) .",
    "we equip our quantum computer with a different , _ railroad - switch _ clock register .",
    "this results in an effective translation from the circuit model to a hamiltonian ( continuous - time ) model of quantum computation with a simple , frustration - free , time - independent , now only 3-local hamiltonian .",
    "note , that to show the universality of our model , we do not need to use the adiabatic theorem , because our hamiltonian is frustration - free ( see section [ aqcsection ] ) .",
    "recently , mizel et .",
    "@xcite took an alternative approach with a construction using physical particles jumping down a grid , utilizing only 2-particle ( but 4-site ) interactions . for comparison ,",
    "when we look at their construction encoded using qubits , the interactions become 4-local .    after finishing the present article",
    ", we found out that @xcite also contains a 3-local version of this computer , using a so - called _ switch _ primitive , unknown to the wider community .",
    "the details of the dynamics of feynman s model with such a clock were then analyzed by defalco et al . in @xcite , later focusing on the entropy of the clock register in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are two things that make our re - discovery different from previous work .",
    "first , we in the 3-local construction we focus on choosing a random time for the final measurement , which requires less detailed analysis than the one in @xcite .",
    "we also look at the problem from a modern quantum information perspective , and make connections of our work to other universality models such as adiabatic quantum computation .",
    "second , we take a step further and make the clock construction a two - local one ( for a qubit and a qutrit ) .",
    "this paves the way for a possible future new proof of universality of 2-local hamiltonians without the requirement of large norm penalty terms dictated by perturbation theory gadgets as in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ clocksection ] we review the continuous - time quantum computing model based on feynman s idea and the usual ways of encoding the clock register .",
    "we present our main innovation , the clock register with railroad - switch gadgets in section [ switchsection ] , and bound the required running time of the resulting 3-local hqc model in section [ dynamicssection ] .",
    "next , we discuss how our result relates to the universality of adiabatic quantum computation in section [ aqcsection ] and analyze the gap protecting the computational subspace in section [ gapsection ] .",
    "section [ section23 ] contains our second result , a universal hqc model involving only 2-local qubit - qutrit interactions .",
    "finally , in appendix [ walksection ] we prove a lemma about the mixing of a continuous - time quantum walk on a cycle , utilized in section [ dynamicssection ] for the analysis of the required running time of our model .",

    "the region where the computation is done is marked .",

    "d ) the cycle corresponding to a padded circuit @xmath3 . [ figurecircle],width=384 ]    already in 1985 , feynman @xcite investigated the possibility of simulating a sequence of reversible classical gates in a quantum - mechanical system .",
    "the construction he found applies equally well to implementing a quantum circuit , which is also reversible .",
    "let @xmath14 be a sequence of @xmath0 unitary transformations @xmath15 on @xmath16 qubits .",
    "consider a quantum system with two registers , @xmath17 , where the first of these holds @xmath16 work qubits @xmath18 .",
    "the role of the clock register is to hold a pointer - indicating how far the computation has progressed .",
    "a simple time - independent hamiltonian then facilitates the evaluation of the circuit @xmath3 on the work register of this system .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath15 acts on the work register .",
    "the first type of transition given by this hamiltonian increases the clock register from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , while applying the unitary @xmath15 to the corresponding work qubits .",
    "similarly , the other transition decreases the clock register and uncomputes the unitary @xmath15 . fixing an initial state @xmath5 of the work qubits and taking @xmath22 , we can define a basis @xmath23 of a particular subspace @xmath24 of the whole hilbert space @xmath17 . within each such subspace",
    ", feynman s hamiltonian has a very simple form : @xmath25 .",
    "\\label{nicebasis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is a hamiltonian of a quantum walk on the `` line '' of states @xmath13 , as each state @xmath13 is connected by a transition in @xmath26 only to its direct neighbors ( see figure [ figurecircle ] ) .",
    "time evolution with @xmath27 according to the schrdinger equation thus brings the initial state @xmath28 into some superposition of the states @xmath13 .",
    "after some time @xmath29 , let us measure the clock register .",
    "when we obtain @xmath0 , the state of the system after the measurement becomes @xmath30 .",
    "the work register then contains the desired output of the circuit @xmath3 .",
    "one might argue that this does nt happen too often .",
    "however , we can boost the probability of obtaining @xmath31 by slightly modifying our system .",
    "first , we pad the circuit with @xmath32 extra identity operations @xmath33 and , accordingly , expand the clock register to hold states @xmath34 ( see figure [ figurecircle]b ) .",
    "all the states @xmath35 of the work register with @xmath36 are now the same  equal to the desired output state @xmath37 .",
    "we now let the system evolve from @xmath38 for a time @xmath29 chosen uniformly at random between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "because the quantum walk on a line is rapidly mixing , the probability to measure a state with the clock register @xmath41 at time @xmath29 is close to @xmath42 , as we show in appendix [ walksection ]",
    ". this yields the desired state @xmath37 of the work qubits .",
    "if a measurement of the clock register gives us @xmath43 , we repeat the experiment .",
    "note also that we can turn the feynman hamiltonian into a sum of projector terms . to do this",
    ", we change the sign of @xmath26 and add terms of the type @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 just as in , the hamiltonian @xmath47 restricted to a subspace spanned by the basis has a simple matrix form @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{hfeynmanpmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that as the rows sum to zero , for any initial state of the work qubits @xmath5 , the corresponding history state @xmath49 is the ground state of @xmath50 , with energy equal to zero .",
    "again , @xmath47 is a hamiltonian of a quantum walk on a line , although now with a small modification at the endpoints and a shifted spectrum : @xmath51 this is the form of the hamiltonian which kitaev used in @xcite ( along with additional terms ) to prove @xmath10-completeness of the local hamiltonian problem .",
    "finally , note that we can get rid of the endpoint terms by wrapping the computation around on a circle as in figure [ figurecircle]c .",
    "so far , we havent said anything about how the clock register is actually implemented .",
    "its states should indicate where in the computation we are , encoding the @xmath52 different states @xmath21 .",
    "the first nave approach is to use a binary encoding of @xmath53 which would require @xmath54 qubits .",
    "however , the transition operators @xmath55 in the feynman hamiltonian would then be highly nonlocal .",
    "it is much better to use the idea feynman originally had in mind .",
    "imagine the clock register as the state space of a pointer particle hopping on a line @xmath56 , with the state @xmath21 corresponding to the pointer positioned at @xmath53 . this _ pulse clock",
    "_ uses @xmath52 clock qubits @xmath57 , representing the states @xmath21 as @xmath58 with a single clock qubit ( indicating the pointer ) in the state @xmath59 .",
    "what is the reason to take such a generous approach , using only @xmath52 of the @xmath60 states available in the state space of the pulse clock register ?",
    "for the pulse clock , the transition operators in acting on the clock register can be implemented just 2-locally , acting nontrivially on only two clock qubits and as an identity on the rest of the system : @xmath61 two - qubit unitaries @xmath15 are necessary for universal quantum computation , so the hamiltonian with the pulse clock encoding contains 4-local terms .",
    "our main result , given in section [ switchsection ] , uses a pulse - type clock and implements just 3-locally .",
    "note though , that there are two problems with the pulse clock .",
    "first , it is not entirely simple to locally check the clock register for correctness ( ruling out the states with two neighboring @xmath62 s , but also with two far - away @xmath62 s ) .",
    "second , the pulse clock requires initialization  ensuring that the clock register _ has _ a pointer ( a spin in the state @xmath59 ) at all .",
    "this ca nt be done by using only local positive semidefinite terms in the hamiltonian , which makes the pulse clock unsuitable for obtaining @xmath63-completeness results such as @xcite .    another way of encoding the states @xmath21 is a _ domain wall clock _ , using a unary representation of @xmath21 , introduced by kitaev @xcite for his local hamiltonian problem .",
    "the progression of states ( on @xmath64 clock qubits ) is @xmath65 where the `` clock time '' ( or alternatively , pointer position ) @xmath53 is determined by the position of the domain wall @xmath66 .",
    "a useful property of the domain wall clock is that we can check whether the state of the clock register is in one of the states @xmath21 by 2-local operators .",
    "what suffices is to ensure that the sequence @xmath67 never occurs .",
    "moreover , we can ensure that there is a single domain wall @xmath66 in the clock register by imposing that the first qubit is fixed to @xmath62 and that the last qubit is @xmath68 .",
    "this solves the initialization problem of the pulse clock ( where we ca nt rule out the state @xmath69 by simultaneously satisfiable local positive - semidefinite operators ) . with the domain wall clock ,",
    "the transition operators in @xmath26 are 3-local , as we need @xmath70 recall that we want to increase the clock register while appling two - qubit unitaries . feynman s",
    "hamiltonian with the domain wall clock is thus 5-local .",
    "if one uses transition operators with smaller locality ( as in @xcite ) , transitions to illegal clock states ( states of the clock register other than the prescribed @xmath21 ) will occur in the hamiltonian time evolution with @xmath26 .",
    "this needs to be dealt with by imposing large energy penalty terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian will no longer be frustration - free .",
    "for this reason , the domain wall clock does not fit our present purpose : finding a simple , low - locality , frustration - free hamiltonian with a small norm , allowing us to do universal quantum computation by the time - evolution it generates .",
    "another approach is to combine the two clock constructions above by interspersing a domain wall clock lattice with a pulse clock lattice . in this fashion , nagaj and",
    "mozes @xcite and eldar et al .",
    "@xcite showed @xmath10-completeness of the 3-local hamiltonian problem @xcite with a much larger promise gap .",
    "going beyond the linear structure of the pulse / domain wall clocks , eldar et al .",
    "@xcite have recently come up with a novel idea .",
    "they use a progression of states of the clock register that can go from @xmath20 to @xmath21 by two different routes , depending on the state of one of the work qubits .",
    "this results in their proof that the quantum 2-sat problem @xcite for a cinquit - qutrit pair ( each q-2-sat condition acts on one 5-dimensional and one 3-dimensional quantum system ) is @xmath63-complete @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we take the nonlinear route as well , construct a novel , pulse - type clock and make the feynman hamiltonian 3-local ( as opposed to 4-local with the usual pulse clock ) .",
    "what makes our construction different from @xcite is a bit - flip symmetry which allows us to easily analyze the system s dynamics and prove its universality .",
    "for a given quantum circuit @xmath3 , our goal is to construct a hamiltonian which facilitates time evolution of a particular initial state towards a state very much like , encoding the result of @xmath3 . specifically , we focus on the clock register encoding of the feynman hamiltonian .",
    "we base our construction on a pulse clock .",
    "we can view the progression of the pointer @xmath62 in the clock states @xmath21 as a train moving along a single track as in figure [ figurepulse ] .",
    "as it goes between stations @xmath71 to @xmath72 , one - qubit or two - qubit unitary operations @xmath15 are applied to the work qubits .",
    "clock qubits with a single active qubit ( the train ) in the state @xmath59 .",
    "when the clock qubit @xmath73 is active , the pulse clock encodes the state @xmath21 .",
    "[ figurepulse],width=240 ]    for any single qubit gate , the operator @xmath74 is already 3-local . besides single - qubit gates ,",
    "all that is necessary for universality is the ability to apply the 2-qubit cnot gate .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , 4-local interactions are required for this in the standard feynman hamiltonian construction . to do it with only 3-local interactions , we have to add a twist to the pulse clock , going beyond its linear structure . for each cnot gate , instead of viewing the clock register as a train on a single track as in figure [ figurepulse ] , we introduce a railroad switch gadget with two tracks , depicted in figure [ figureswitch ] .",
    "the train will use the upper or lower track depending on the state of a ` train master ' @xmath75  one of the work qubits . only on the upper track ,",
    "the target work qubit @xmath76 is flipped .",
    "the gadget thus facilitates the application of a cnot gate on the work qubits @xmath75 and @xmath76 .     and",
    "@xmath76 , using only 3-local terms . comparing to the pulse clock in figure [ figurepulse ] ,",
    "there are four extra clock qubits inserted between @xmath71 and @xmath73 , creating two tracks .",
    "the routing of the train ( active site ) from @xmath71 ( and @xmath73 ) to the upper and lower tracks is conditioned on the state of the train master  a control qubit @xmath75 in the work register .",
    "furthermore , when the train moves from @xmath77 to @xmath78 on the upper track , the target work qubit @xmath76 is flipped .",
    "[ figureswitch],width=345 ]    our resulting hamiltonian @xmath79 is composed from positive semidefinite 3-local terms , so it is a quantum 3-sat hamiltonian .",
    "we prove the universality of this 3-local hamiltonian computer model where we let an easily prepared starting state evolve with @xmath79 for not too long a time , and also for an adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) where we slowly change the hamiltonian from a simple starting hamiltonian @xmath80 to @xmath79 .",
    "we discuss this connection to aqc in detail in section [ aqcsection ] .",
    "let us present the details of the railroad switch .",
    "the original pulse clock has @xmath52 qubits @xmath57 .",
    "when a cnot gate is due at step @xmath53 ( i.e. @xmath15=cnot ) , we introduce four extra clock qubits ( @xmath81 ) between @xmath71 and @xmath72 as in figure [ figureswitch ] .",
    "let us call the control work qubit @xmath75 , and the target qubit for the cnot @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath75 is in the state @xmath82 , the active site ( the train ) in the clock register can only follow the upper track . for @xmath75 in the state @xmath83",
    ", it must take the lower track .",
    "furthermore , when the train moves from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , we flip the target qubit @xmath76 .",
    "the train then moves to the clock qubit @xmath73 and the two tracks ( computational paths ) merge .",
    "this effectively applies a cnot gate between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the transition operators for the upper track are now all 3-local : @xmath84 because the operators @xmath85 , etc .",
    "can be implemented for our pulse - type clock only 2-locally as @xmath86 acting trivially on the rest of the clock qubits .",
    "the hamiltonian for the upper track is then a sum of - .",
    "if we desire so , we have the option of making it a sum of projectors by adding a few terms as in .",
    "the projector version of the hamiltonian for the upper track is then a sum of three 3-local projectors : @xmath87 note that when the clock register is in a proper clock state , i.e. one and only one clock qubit is in the state @xmath59 , the projectors such as @xmath88 are easily implemented 1-locally as @xmath89 .",
    "analogously , the transition operators for the lower track are @xmath90 again , we can add a few terms and turn them into projectors , obtaining @xmath91    we now replace each term @xmath92 in for those @xmath53 where @xmath93cnot with the railway switch gadget hamiltonian @xmath94 obtaining @xmath95      let us now look at the time evolution generated by this hamiltonian , focusing first on a single railway switch .",

    "consider the action of on the state @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a general state of the work register and the clock register has the active site ( train ) at @xmath71 . while the train is within the railroad switch gadget , the transitions given in dictate that the state of the system does not leave the subspace spanned by the following four states : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "observe that the work qubits of the state @xmath100 have the cnot gate applied to @xmath101 , as we wanted , meaning that @xmath102 this gives us a method of applying a 2-local cnot gate while updating the clock register at the same time  via only 3-local interactions between the work and clock registers .    before introducing the railroad switch , the progression of states @xmath103 , @xmath104 ,",

    ", we can change the ` line ' of states @xmath13 into a circle of length @xmath118 as in figure [ figurecircle]c .",
    "first , we double the clock register as @xmath119 where the hamiltonian involving the second clock register has the same form .",
    "second , we identify the endpoint qubits , i.e. @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this gives the clock register the geometry of a cycle , with a unique state @xmath122 corresponding to @xmath123 .",
    "the active site ( spin up ) in the clock register can proceed towards @xmath124 both ways , as in figure [ figurecircle]c .",
    "the span of this new set of states @xmath13 with the geometry of a circle then defines the subspace @xmath125 . when we restrict the new hamiltonian including the terms involving the clock qubits @xmath126 to the subspace @xmath127 and express it in the basis @xmath128 , we get @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the adjacency matrix for a cycle of length @xmath32",
    ". the dynamics of this system is a  quantum walk on a  cycle , which we analyze in detail in appendix [ walksection ] .",
    "there we prove    consider a continuous time quantum walk on a cycle of length @xmath0 ( divisible by 4 ) , where the hamiltonian is the negative of the adjacency matrix for the cycle .",
    "let the system evolve for a time @xmath131 chosen uniformly at random , starting in a position basis state @xmath83 .",
    "the probability to measure a position state @xmath132 farther than @xmath133 from the starting point ( the farther two thirds of the cycle ) is then bounded from below as @xmath134 .",
    "thus , when starting from the state concentrated on a single site of the line and letting the sytem evolve for a time chosen uniformly at random between zero and a number not larger than @xmath2 , the probability to find the state farther than @xmath135 from the starting point is close to @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to finding a state with a spin up on clock qubit @xmath136 ( lower part of the circle ) or @xmath137 ( upper part of the circle ) , depicted as the success region in figure [ figurecircle]d . in both cases , because the circuit @xmath3 was padded with identity gates as in , the state of the work qubits is then @xmath8 and contains the output of the quantum circuit @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian allows us to simulate a quantum computation @xmath3 with @xmath138 gates ( here @xmath116 is the number of single qubit gates and @xmath117 counts the cnot s ) , as follows :    1 .   construct a pulse clock register with @xmath139 qubits .",

    "the quantum 3-sat problem ( `` does a common zero - energy ground state of a sum of 3-local projectors exist ? '' ) is certainly np - complete , but we still do not know whether it is also @xmath63-complete @xcite .",
    "our railroad switch clock is not suitable for proofs of @xmath63 hardness of quantum-@xmath144-sat , because it requires initialization ( see section [ clocksection ] ) .",
    "however , in this work we found that time - independent quantum 3-sat hamiltonians can be universal in the following sense .",
    "we constructed @xmath142 : a frustration - free , quantum 3-sat hamiltonian ( a sum of @xmath1 3-local projector terms ) powerful enough to perform universal quantum computation in the hamiltonian quantum computer model based on a quantum walk .",
    "when the number of qubits and gates involved in the circuit is @xmath0 , what we need for our quantum 3-sat hamiltonian computer are thus @xmath1 qubits , a hamiltonian with @xmath1 projector terms with norm @xmath145 , resulting in @xmath146 , and a running time of order @xmath40 . the rescaled required resources ( time @xmath147 energy )",
    "scale as @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , we show in section [ gapsection ] that the computation is protected by an energy gap scaling like @xmath149 between the legal subspace @xmath127 and the subspaces orthogonal to it , with the exception of the computationally dead subspace without a train ( active site in the clock register ) .",
    "this energy barrier could be increased ( at the cost of increasing the locality of interactions ) by using error correcting codes like the ones developed for aqc by jordan et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although local ( in the number of particles in each interaction term ) , feynman - like hamiltonians are not geometrically local .",

    "the downside of their construction is that the hamiltonian does nt keep the computational subspace invariant ( it is also not is not frustration - free , with ground states which are history states ) .",
    "it thus does nt generate evolution directly towards .",
    "moreover , because it is based on perturbation gadgets , the eigenvalue gap of the final rescaled hamiltonian itself is a rather large inverse polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "its use for aqc is thus impractical .",
    "two of the current ways of approaching this problem are then using higher - dimensional particles ( qudits ) @xcite , or higher locality of interactions @xcite .",
    "the model of computation we just described falls into a general category of hamiltonian quantum computers ( hqc ) which initialize a system in a simple initial state , let it evolve for not too long a time , and end with a measurement of a few qubits ( in the computational basis ) .",
    "our hqc requires initializing the system in the state @xmath38 , and then releasing it to evolve with the hamiltonian @xmath79 .",
    "we now look at the initialization in more detail and investigate how fast can we peform the ` release ' . for the initialization ,",
    "it is useful to think of @xmath38 as the unique ground state of the 2-local , initial hamiltonian @xmath150 which is diagonal in the computational basis .",
    "while @xmath151 prefers the clock register in the state @xmath152 , the term @xmath153 gives an energy penalty to states whose work register is not properly initialized , i.e. all zero when the clock is in @xmath154 . to let the hqc run",
    ", we turn off @xmath155 and turn on @xmath79 .",
    "one way to do it is linearly as @xmath156 for our choice of @xmath107 and a large enough @xmath157 , the conditions of the adiabatic theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) could hold .",
    "this model would then become an adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite , where the system stays close to the instantaneous ground state of the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath158 . at @xmath159 ,",
    "the system would thus be close to the ground state of @xmath79  the history state .",
    "because of the energy gap , the aqc model has some protection against noise during the computation .",
    "the robustness and fault tolerance of the aqc has been recently investigated by childs et al .",
    "@xcite , jordan et al .",
    "@xcite , lidar @xcite and lloyd @xcite .",
    "the challenge today is to find more new , entirely adiabatic algorithms , such as the adiabatic state preparation of aharonov and ta - shma @xcite .    in @xcite , aharonov et al .",
    "proved that adiabatic quantum computation is polynomially equivalent to the standard quantum circuit model of quantum computation .",
    "this proof has two directions .",
    "first , as shown before by farhi et .",
    "@xcite we can simulate time evolution with an aqc hamiltonian on a standard quantum computer , dividing the time into small intervals and approximating the time evolution in each slice .",
    "the usual procedure utilizes the finite @xmath16 approximation of the trotter - suzuki formula and the resulting unitary transformations are applied using a circuit - based quantum computer .",
    "second , @xcite shows that any quantum computation can be simulated by aqc with @xmath157 polynomial in @xmath0 ( the number of gates in the circuit @xmath3 ) . for this",
    ", they utilize a feynman - type hamiltonian similar to , with a particular encoding of the clock register .",
    "the key element is a lower bound on the eigenvalue gap of the hamiltonian for all @xmath53  an inverse polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "however , in @xcite , lloyd has shown that a fast passage from @xmath155 to the final hamiltonian works just as well .",
    "let us consider the extreme case  an almost instantaneous change in the hamiltonian .",
    "the state of the system then stays close to the initial state .",
    "the system then continues to evolve according to the final hamiltonian . as we have seen in section [ dynamicssection ] , this hamiltonian evolves the initial state within a particular _ computational subspace _ spanned by plane - wave eigenvectors of the hamiltonian of the quantum walk on the line @xmath160 .",
    "within this subspace , it rapidly ` mixes ' , in the sense that at a random time between @xmath39 and @xmath161 , the system is likely to have an active site in the clock register in the success region ( see figure [ figurecircle ] ) .",
    "the sectors of the hilbert space containing @xmath162 ( computing on the proper initial state ) and @xmath163 ( computing on badly initialized work qubits ) do not mix , because the hamiltonian does not couple them . running the hqc",
    "then can give us the resulting state @xmath11 with high probability , even though we turned on @xmath79 quickly .",
    "the proof of aqc s universality thus works just as well without the adiabatic theorem ( requiring some extra time evolution after reaching the final hamiltonian ) .",
    "the essential element required for this result is that the system evolves only within a preferred computational subspace .",
    "this in turn is the result of our railroad - switch clock register construction  which is frustration free , and does nt induce any ` illegal ' transitions .",
    "therefore , our result means that previous universality results for 3-local hamiltonians which required large penalty terms can be greatly simplified , and are valid even without assuming adiabaticity .",
    "we can now ask where the real power of adiabatic quantum computing lies ",
    "e.g. whether the model can stay universal if we only use restricted terms in the hamiltonian as in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian quantum computation model we just presented is based on two premises .",
    "first , we initialize the system in a computational basis product state .",
    "second , the hamiltonian of the system is such that the schrdinger time evolution of this state runs within a particular subspace .",
    "transitions bringing the state of the system out of this computational subspace are not present in the hamiltonian .",
    "this allowed us to understand the dynamics of this model and bound its required running time .",
    "we now ask what are the implications of noise on the dynamics of the system and how could we possibly protect the system from moving away from the computational subspace .",
    "let us first look at the structure of the hilbert space in the light of our hamiltonian . according to the number of active sites in the clock register ,",
    "the hilbert space is a direct sum @xmath164 .",
    "the orthogonal subspaces @xmath165 are not coupled by our hamiltonian .",
    "we divide them into three cathegories .",
    "first , we would like to avoid the subspaces @xmath166 with more than one active clock site .",
    "we can deal with them by a 2-local , @xmath1 norm , clock - checking hamiltonian @xmath167 its terms add an energy penalty for two neighboring ( also within individual railroad switches ) active sites in the clock . although states such as @xmath168 are not directly violating , eigenstates of @xmath107 containing such clock registers have nonzero energy .",
    "an eigenstate with two trains in the clock register misses required terms coming from the propagation hamiltonian .",
    "if they were all present , terms like @xmath169 with an illegal clock configuration detected by would appear .",
    "this line of reasoning goes along the lines of the clairvoyance lemma of aharonov et .",
    "al . in @xcite .",
    "it can be used to show that after adding @xmath170 , the energy of the states in the sectors @xmath166 is at least @xmath149 .",
    "second , we have to deal with @xmath171  the computationally `` dead '' subspace with no active site in the clock register .",
    "this is a problem of the pulse clock ( see section [ clocksection ] ) .",
    "noise which could kill the active site in the clock could thus also kill the computation .",
    "one way to prevent this is to energetically favor a single active site by adding a carefully balanced hamiltonian of the form @xmath172 where the sum in the second term is taken over neighboring qubits in the clock register .",
    "together with the clairvoyance lemma in action , this hamiltonian favors a single active site over none ( or over too many of them ) . however , adding @xmath173 means that our total hamiltonian can no longer be rewritten as a sum of 3-local projector terms with a common zero - energy ground state ( and thus be frustration - free ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we have the subspace @xmath174 with a single train , which can be further decomposed into subspaces corresponding to different initial states @xmath5 of the @xmath16 work qubits : @xmath175 out of these , @xmath176 is our computational subspace , corresponding to all states that can be reached by schrdinger time evolution from the initial state .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath107 in the subspace @xmath177 are the momentum states @xmath178 , labeled by momentum @xmath179 and the initial state of the work qubits @xmath5 .",
    "for the badly initialized states with @xmath180 , lloyd @xcite showed that @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the energy gap between the computational subspace @xmath182 and the subspaces @xmath183 is again on the order of @xmath149 .",
    "could we modify the quantum-3-sat hamiltonian of section [ switchsection ] to make it only 2-local ?",
    "this is probably too much to ask when restricting ourselves to qubits .",
    "nevertheless , by using qutrits in place of some of the qubits , we can obtain a 2-local construction .",
    "first , we modify the model from section [ switchsection ] , and show that the result is a quantum walk on a necklace  a cycle with regularly spaced extra nodes connected to it .",
    "using the results of @xcite , we bound the required running time of this model .",
    "we modify the gadget from figure [ figureswitch ] by using three qutrits and two qubits on each track , as in figure [ figure23 ] .",
    "a qubit can be active @xmath59 or inactive @xmath184 .",
    "on the other hand , each qutrit will have two active states @xmath185 , @xmath186 ( left and right ) and one inactive state @xmath184 .",
    "we label the possible positions of the active site in the clock register ( the train ) on the upper track by @xmath187 , @xmath188 and denote the corresponding states of the clock register @xmath189 , @xmath190 , etc .",
    "similarly , we label the possible train positions on the bottom track @xmath191 and the corresponding clock register states @xmath192 , @xmath193 , etc .",
    "there are two types of 2-local transition rules for the upper track .",
    "first , we have 6 straightforward rules corresponding to the thick black lines on the upper track in figure [ figure23 ] : @xmath194 second , we have the transitions denoted by red half - circles in figure [ figure23 ] .",
    "they are also 2-local , involving a work qubit and a clock qutrit : @xmath195 the rules and are conditioned on the state of the control qubit @xmath75 , and flips the target work qubit @xmath76 when transitioning between @xmath196 and @xmath197 in the clock register .",
    "similar transition rules apply to the bottom track .",
    "the straightforward terms are @xmath198 and the analogues of and for the lower track are conditioned on the control qubit @xmath75 being @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath199 finally , the analogue of is simply @xmath200 leaving the work qubit @xmath76 untouched . summing all the terms in - gives us the 2-local qubit - qutrit railroad switch hamiltonian @xmath201 .    ,",
    "width=288 ]     restricted to the subspace @xmath202 ( within one gadget ) .",
    "[ figurecomb],width=192 ]     in a particular basis .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to states within one railroad - switch gadget .",
    "[ figurenecklace],width=153 ]    similarly to what we did in section [ dynamicssection ] , let us examine where the transitions in this hamiltonian take the state @xmath203 where @xmath204 is a general state of the work register and the active site of clock register is at the qubit @xmath71 . within the gadget ,",
    "the transitions in @xmath205 move this state around a 12-dimensional subspace @xmath206 with the geometry of allowed transitions depicted in figure [ figurecomb ] .",
    "the basis of this subspace contains first the endpoint states @xmath207 where @xmath208 has the target qubit @xmath76 flipped .",
    "second , we have the sequence @xmath209 finally , the last two states in the basis are the two ` blind - alley ' states , in which the active site tries to use the track which it is not supposed to take @xmath210 omitting the connection to the region outside the gadget , this 12-dimensional subspace @xmath202 is invariant under the transitions in @xmath201 .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the dynamics of @xmath201 using the basis just given . in this basis",
    ", the hamiltonian within one gadget has a very simple form  the adjacency matrix of a line @xmath211 with two additional nodes @xmath212 and @xmath213 as in figure [ figurecomb ] . moreover",
    ", we can give our clock register a very regular form by arranging 8 clock qubits between two successive gadgets .",
    "we can then choose to look at the dynamics of our system in a basis consisting of states of the form ( for the non - gadget parts ) and of the bases just given for individual gadgets .",
    "similarly to what we found in section [ dynamicssection ] , in this basis the hamiltonian of our model has a very simple form .",
    "it is an adjacency matrix of a ring with extra lines sticking out of it on every 9-th point as in figure [ figurenecklace ] .",
    "this allows us to forget about the content of the work register when solving the dynamics of the time evolution with our hamiltonian .    finally , we need to find the required running time for the qubit - qutrit model .",
    "the dynamics of the time evolution generated by the hamiltonian is a quantum walk on a necklace from figure [ figurenecklace ] . in an upcoming paper by nagaj and reitzner @xcite",
    ", we investigate the mixing properties of this type of quantum walks .",
    "again , the mixing is fast .",
    "when we start in the initial state , and let the system evolve with @xmath205 for a random time @xmath214 with @xmath215 ( up to logarithmic factors ) and measure the output work qubit , our model is universal for @xmath12 .",
