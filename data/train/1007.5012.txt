    "in the low energy limit the electronic properties of graphene are well described by massless dirac spinors @xmath0 in two space and one time dimensions , hence an analog of a relativistic system but with characteristic velocity given by the fermi velocity @xmath1 rather than the speed of light @xmath2",
    "@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a ( flat ) spacetime index .",
    "this action is scale and conformally invariant .",
    "the main messages of this paper are two , one general and one practical .",
    "the general suggestion is that _ intrinsic _ curvature of the two - dimensional graphene sheet within this special relativistic - like behavior naturally leads to a general relativistic - like description rather than @xmath2 . nonetheless , besides that , considerations are along the same lines as for the fundamental theories . ] of @xmath0 regarded as a dirac field in a _ curved three - dimensional spacetime _ back - ground @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the general covariant derivative , an important role being played by the _ local _ weyl symmetry enjoyed by the electronic system .",
    "this suggestion , we shall see , comes very naturally when time is included in the analysis .",
    "the second , practical , main message of this paper is that the local weyl symmetry of the graphene action can simplify the analysis of its electronic properties to the extent of allowing to find specific shapes of the graphene sheet for which _ the electronic local density of states ( ldos ) is the same as that for a planar sheet _ , provided times and lengths are measured in accordance to the inner reference frame of the electronic system .",
    "we find that when the bending of the graphene sheet gives rise to a constant intrinsic two - dimensional curvature , the three - dimensional metric ( the one that includes time ) is truly curved also in the time direction , although , for the cases specifically considered here , only in a very special way ( conformally flat ) .",
    "once such a general relativistic - like spacetime is accepted as physically meaningful , a special role is played by these conformally flat spacetimes @xmath7 because in that case the curved space action ( [ second ] ) is _ equal _ to the flat space action ( [ first ] ) , provided the fields are related by a weyl transformation @xmath8 hence the euler - lagrange ( dirac ) equations for @xmath9 in the curved case are equal to those for @xmath0 in the flat case .",
    "as we shall see , this is so because of the special status of the massless dirac action in any dimension .",
    "the three dimensions play a crucial role for other important matters , like for instance the particular form for the constraints for conformal flatness ( it is the cotton tensor rather than the weyl tensor that needs to vanish ) but this particular instance , @xmath10 , is independent from the dimensions .",
    "this fact is known in field theory on curved spaces as an instance of _ conformal triviality _",
    "we shall revisit that instance and shall show that it has the consequence of an _ invariant electronic ldos_. our results do not seem to contradict existing studies of the nontrivial effects of curvature on the ldos , such as , e.g , those reported in @xcite , for two reasons : first , the _ ad hoc _ choice of the shape made there can well be outside the class of weyl invariant choices ( surely it is not within the class identified here ) ; second , the measuring procedure adopted there seems to be a non - invariant one ( we shall be more explicit later on this point ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall recall the concepts of scale , conformal and weyl symmetries in general and for the case of a massless dirac field , and discuss the special case of conformal triviality and its impact on the green functions . in section 3",
    "we shall relate the above to the case in point of the electronic properties of a graphene sheet and shall discuss the impact on the ldos . in section 4",
    "we shall see which two - dimensional bending of the graphene sheet produces a case of conformal triviality in the three - dimensional spacetime and learn that these conditions are quite natural , i.e. constant intrinsic curvature of the two - dimensional sheet .",
    "this means three possibilities : i ) the sheet is a plane ; ii ) the sheet is flat but not planar ( we find that this corresponds to two - dimensional conformal factors that are harmonic functions ) ; iii ) the bent sheet is truly curved with a constant intrinsic curvature ( we find that this corresponds to two - dimensional conformal factors that are solutions of the liouville equation ) .",
    "there we notice that , although the system is truly a three - dimensional one , due to the nature of the metric used , two - dimensional conformal field theory structures , such as the virasoro algebra or the liouville equation naturally appear .",
    "section 5 is devoted to collect our results and to discuss various possible directions for future investigations , in particular whether it makes sense for the physics of graphene to use the rich landscape of solutions of three - dimensional gravity , including black - holes .",
    "scale , conformal , and weyl symmetries are intimately related but different . for the general case of theories in any dimension and with arbitrary spin",
    "the issue was discussed at length in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to focus on the special case of the massless dirac field in two space and one time dimensions because it is relevant for graphene . to fully appreciate the peculiarities of this case , though , and for the sake of introducing notation and concepts let us start this section by reviewing the results of @xcite and by putting them in the right perspective for the applications we intend to pursue .",
    "consider an action in @xmath11 dimensions for the field @xmath12 , where @xmath13 stands for a generic spin index , invariant under general coordinate transformations @xmath14 ( diffeomorphisms ) and local lorentz transformations @xmath15 @xmath16 this action could be in flat space in curvilinear coordinates or in a truly curved geometry .",
    "we implicitly introduced the vielbein @xmath17 and its inverse @xmath18 @xmath19 the indices @xmath20 that respond to diffeomorphisms ( einstein indices ) , while @xmath21 respond to flat space transformations ( lorentz indices ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the diffeomorphic covariant derivative that is @xmath24 with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 the appropriate form of the generators of the lorentz transformations is a scalar field then @xmath28 , while if @xmath29 is a dirac spinor , the case we shall be dealing with , then @xmath30_\\alpha^{\\ ; \\beta}$ ] , etc .. ] and @xmath31 is the spin connection obtained by requiring the full covariant derivative of the vielbein to be zero ( metricity condition ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the christoffel connection . torsion is defined as @xmath34 } = e_{\\;\\ ; a}^\\lambda t^a_{\\;\\ ; \\mu \\nu}$ ] where the expression in terms of vielbein is @xmath35 } + \\omega_{[\\mu } \\ ; e_{\\nu ] } ) ^a $ ] , see the appendix .",
    "at this point it is not required that @xmath36 and to keep track of that might become important if topological defects described by a cartan - einstein model of gravity with torsion ( dislocations ) need to be included @xcite , @xcite .    due to diffeomorphism invariance of ( [ diffeogeneralaction ] ) a rigid scaling of the coordinates can be transferred to the vielbein ] which , requiring @xmath37 , gives @xmath38 , that is the same result obtained with @xmath39 and requiring @xmath40 .",
    "the second choice , though , hides an important difference , namely that @xmath41 in @xmath42 is indeed just @xmath43 , hence the transformation now does not involve the coordinates but only the fields @xmath17 . ] ( or , equivalently , to the metric ) .",
    "it is then clear then that when the flat space limit of @xmath44 in ( [ diffeogeneralaction ] ) , say @xmath45 is symmetric under rigid scaling @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the scale dimension of the field dictated by the kinetic term , then @xmath44 is symmetric under @xmath48 the transformations ( [ weylgeneral ] ) are called _ rigid _ ( being @xmath49 constant ) weyl transformations",
    ". they are called _ local _ weyl transformations if @xmath50 .",
    "let us now recall that often poincar and scale invariant actions are also invariant under the full conformal group of transformations , namely , on top of the poincar and scale transformations , they are invariant under those transformations for which the scaling parameter is and @xmath51 ( and sometimes @xmath52 , as in @xcite ) .",
    "they are all equivalent to the application to @xmath53 of an inversion followed by a translation by @xmath54 , followed by an inversion . ]",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath54 is a constant vector parameter , and sc stands for _ special conformal _ transformations .",
    "this is the case of the massless dirac action of our concern here but it is not always true .    the exact criterion to establish when it is true that scale invariance of the flat space action implies full conformal invariance of the latter invokes the local weyl invariance of the curvilinear action , as one might suspect by noticing that @xmath56 is coordinate dependent .",
    "the general procedure is presented in detail in @xcite and we shall not do it again here but it is crucial for us to understand the special status of the dirac action in any dimension with respect to fields of integer spin .",
    "thus , let us consider the case of a general @xmath43-dependent scaling parameter @xmath50 , i.e. not constrained to be @xmath56 . for @xmath50",
    "the weyl transformations ( [ weylgeneral ] ) are not symmetries of @xmath44 in ( [ diffeogeneralaction ] ) , just like the scale transformations ( [ scalegeneral ] ) when @xmath50 , in general , are no longer symmetries of @xmath57 in ( [ flatgeneralaction ] ) .",
    "to make @xmath58 invariant we need to gauge it _  la _ weyl ( these considerations now presume torsionless connections ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 under ( [ weylgeneral ] ) with @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 . as for usual gauge theories ,",
    "the action is _ modified _ to a new one that is invariant : @xmath65 under ( [ weylgeneral ] ) with @xmath50 .",
    "if and only if this produces an @xmath66 where @xmath67 only appears in a combination , say it @xmath68 $ ] , such that in the flat space limit @xmath69 = 0 $ ] has @xmath56 in ( [ specialconf ] ) as the only solution , then the flat space action ( [ flatgeneralaction ] ) is conformal invariant . in general",
    "this only happens for certain combinations of the spin of the fields and of the dimension of the spacetime .",
    "what just said needs only a little adjustment in relation to the two - dimensional case , where the @xmath56s are many more than just ( [ specialconf ] ) as all harmonic @xmath70s ( i.e. the infinite solutions of @xmath71 ) correspond to conformal transformations .",
    "the procedure in this case gives as necessary and sufficient condition for a scale symmetric @xmath72 to be fully conformal invariant that @xmath67 enters @xmath66 as @xmath73 .",
    "special attention is needed for the scalar fields , as pointed out in @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "the status of the massless dirac action in any dimension is very special because with @xmath74 a parameter with the dimensions of velocity , for graphene it is @xmath75 , the fermi velocity , for truly relativistic dirac it is , of course , @xmath76 . ]",
    "@xmath77 due to @xmath78 where we used @xmath79 and the definition of the lorentz generators @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "this means that not only the dirac action in flat space @xmath81 is conformal invariant but that the curvilinear or truly curved space action @xmath82 is local weyl invariant , as can be also seen directly by transforming ( [ diraccurve ] ) under ( [ weylgeneral ] ) with @xmath70 obtaining @xmath83 here it was used @xmath84 .",
    "this and other relevant formulae are in the appendix .    in any dimension",
    "this is a very large symmetry that @xmath85 enjoys because there are no restrictions to @xmath50 of any sort .",
    "this happens for @xmath44 as it stands which means that the theory is , we may say , `` intrinsically gauged '' : @xmath86 . we shall exploit this symmetry in what follows for the graphene action where a crucial role is played by the dimensionality of the problem , which is two space and one time dimensions",
    "let us see here what this symmetry means in physical terms in any dimensions , including the case of graphene .",
    "when two metrics are related as @xmath87 the classical physics for the field @xmath88 in @xmath89 is precisely the same as the classical physics for the field @xmath0 in @xmath90 because @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we can choose @xmath92 and obtain @xmath93 when @xmath94 where we used the simple algebra illustrated in the appendix to write the second form of the action .",
    "we are then dealing with a conformally invariant field in a conformally flat spacetime , a case sometimes referred to as _",
    "conformal triviality _ @xcite .",
    "this means that the effects of curvature are null on the classical physics of a massless dirac field @xmath0 as in ( [ corerelation2 ] ) if the spacetime is only curved in a conformally flat fashion : if the metrics can only be the conformally flat we know from here that the classical physics is once and for all governed by the flat space action .",
    "of course this is not always true as there is no reason in general to consider only conformally flat metrics , but when this happens there is the `` magic '' consequence that although the spacetime is curved this has no effects whatsoever on the classical physics of the system , provided the field is properly redefined .",
    "what for the quantum case ? if we define the flat propagator as usual @xmath95 where @xmath96 we can see the effect of the weyl transformations by considering the unitary operator that implements the transformations quantum mechanically , i.e. @xmath97 by writing @xmath98 and by using @xmath99_{+ } = \\delta^n ( x - y)$ ] , and from @xmath100 + \\frac{1}{2 } [ b,[b,\\psi'(x ) ] ] + \\cdots   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\psi'(x ) + \\frac{n-1}{2 } \\ ; \\sigma(x ) \\psi'(x ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{n-1}{2 } \\ ; \\sigma(x ) \\right)^2 \\psi'(x ) + \\cdots \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we easily obtain @xmath101 i.e. , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "notice also that @xmath104 = 0 $ ] , hence @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the vacuum associated to the weyl transformed fields is of course @xmath107 that shows the typical condensate structure of a quantum field in a curved ( classical ) background @xcite .",
    "now , as discussed at length , e.g. , in @xcite , we can do two things : either we consider @xmath108 or we consider @xmath109 notice that @xmath110 when @xmath111 , as it should be from @xmath103",
    ". summarizing : @xmath112 with @xmath113 the green function for the curved dirac operator @xmath114 as proved in the appendix .",
    "the physical meaning of the two procedures is clear . in the first case , eqs .",
    "( [ directgreen1])-([directgreen3 ] ) , the measurements are made within the frame of reference that is co - moving with the particles described by the field @xmath0 , hence the effects of curvature are completely removed also at the quantum level . in the second case , eqs .",
    "( [ crossgreen1 ] ) and ( [ crossgreen2 ] ) , the measurements are made by an observer that sees the ( quantum ) effects of curvature in the form of a condensate in the vacuum , eq .",
    "( [ uvacuum ] ) .",
    "we faced this sort of situation in @xcite where we dealt with vacuum expectations of the kind @xmath115 ( or viceversa @xmath116 ) , with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the vacuum for a scalar field , e.g. , in a schwarzschild spacetime , with @xmath120 a function related to the acceleration @xmath121 or to the surface gravity @xmath122 ( near the horizon the space - time is always rindler , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the number operator @xmath123 is that of the same field in an inertial frame , i.e. a frame that is not freely falling into the black - hole with acceleration @xmath121 . in other words",
    ", @xmath123 represents a particles `` counter '' placed asymptotically far - away from the horizon in a region that can be approximated as flat .",
    "it is this counter that sees the condensate structure of @xmath119 @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the four momentum in the curved frame , @xmath126 is the inverse temperature , the @xmath127 descends from the algebraic structure of @xmath128 and the relation of the latter to the bose distribution comes from the minimization of the free energy @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , we let our particle counter fall into the black hole , this will not see any horizon , nor there will be a way for it to detect the acceleration , as the principle of equivalence dictates .",
    "mathematically this translates to @xmath129 that is precisely what we get in the absence of any gravitational / acceleration effect , @xmath130 .",
    "returning to our case , if we think of @xmath131 as our `` counter '' , we can apply the same logic just illustrated , i.e. @xmath132 means that we see no effects of curvature , while @xmath133 contains the information on the quantum vacuum condensate .",
    "two instances are important here .",
    "first , the physical picture can only become fully clear when the particular ( conformally flat ) metric @xmath134 has been specified .",
    "when we can do that we can give meaning to lengths and times measured according to the line element @xmath135 , hence we can appreciate the meaning of the invariance @xmath136 .",
    "what this means practically ( i.e. what needs to be done to the measuring apparatus ) depends upon @xmath49 .",
    "second , in @xcite we have been dealing with a truly field theoretical setting , i.e. with an infinite number of degrees of freedom and the related infinite volume limit . in that case",
    "the bogoliubov operators @xmath128 were not well defined in the limit and unitarity was lost ( on this see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the applications to graphene we can safely take the view that unitarity of @xmath137 is never lost",
    "because the size of the sample is always finite and the number of degrees of freedom can not be infinite because to excite more and more degrees of freedom we would need higher and higher energy than that necessary for the `` dirac - like '' approximation to hold ( see next section ) .",
    "a last remark on the quantum regime is related to the fact that what just said seems to apply to any @xmath138 , i.e. not just to the @xmath137s in ( [ u ] ) that generate the weyl transformations hence are symmetries of the classical theory . to select which @xmath138s are to be used",
    "one can look at the path integral version of the green functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and use the classical weyl - symmetry of the action @xmath139 @xmath140 here , since @xmath50 is an external field ( see later ) , we used @xmath141 , similarly for @xmath142 , hence , in the ratio the overall factor @xmath143 cancels . from the above",
    "we see that the green function computed via standard path integral methods , @xmath144 , is indeed @xmath145 in ( [ crossgreen1 ] ) .",
    "this is so because we can as well read ( [ pigreen2 ] ) as @xmath146 nonetheless , after having exploited the classical symmetries in the path integral green functions we can then use the operator approach to find the @xmath138s corresponding to these symmetries , for us here the @xmath137s in ( [ u ] ) , and as well construct the invariant green function as in ( [ directgreen2 ] ) .",
    "let us now compare weyl gauge symmetry to standard gauge symmetry . to this end",
    "consider the dirac action @xmath147 invariant under @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the field that needs to be introduced to adsorb the derivative of the gauge parameter @xmath150 .",
    "the invariance means that @xmath151 , i.e. we can use the fields @xmath0 and @xmath149 or the gauge transformed ones @xmath152 and @xmath153 and we would not be able to see any difference because the physical effects of a nonzero @xmath154 are null for this form of the action . for this part",
    "the analogy with the weyl symmetry we just discussed is total : we can use the fields @xmath0 and @xmath49 or the weyl transformed ones @xmath155 and @xmath156 and we would not be able to see any difference . furthermore ,",
    "for the standard gauge theory ( [ diracgauge ] ) there is no physical meaning we can ascribe to @xmath154 : it is just the parameter of a kind of rotation of the field point by point .",
    "this is the reason why , besides topological non - triviality , the gauge field itself is not observable . here",
    "the analogy with the weyl case breaks down twice , once because @xmath49 is directly related to the metric hence indeed it has a physical meaning on its own , and once because , for the case in point of an intrinsically weyl - gauged action , the weyl - gauge field is absent hence it is not observable because it is not there in the first place .",
    "thus we can indeed take the view that the non - transformed field @xmath0 is performing a curved space physics in a metric @xmath157 , but identical physical results are obtained by considering the weyl - transformed field @xmath9 performing a flat space physics .",
    "weyl symmetry is an internal symmetry hence , as such , the associated noether current is of the form @xmath158 , where , as usual , @xmath159 .",
    "now we have to decide how to treat @xmath49 in ( [ corerelation1 ] ) , namely if we need to include it in the current as one of the fields @xmath12 or not . to properly treat @xmath49 as a dynamical field we would need to include a kinetic term for it ,",
    "just like we do for standard gauge theories where we _ add _ to the _ gauged _ action a further term , usually of the form @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the field strength .",
    "but the dirac action in point needs not be weyl - gauged , that is why there is no @xmath67 field , hence the associated kinetic term , if any , can only be relative to the geometric quantity @xmath49 , hence to the metric .",
    "thus , if no dynamical meaning can be ascribed to @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath50 is an external field , the weyl current is @xmath162 the action ( [ corerelation1 ] ) is also invariant under standard _",
    "rigid _ gauge transformations , i.e. ( [ standardgaugelocal ] ) with @xmath163 , whose associated noether current is @xmath164 the way we interpret this result is that we have to choose which current to retain as physical and @xmath165 , with @xmath166 and @xmath167 , but we shall not do it here . ] , and we may as well choose @xmath168 . with this choice",
    "no further conserved current is introduced when _ rigid _ weyl symmetry is present .",
    "the action is not invariant under local gauge transformation , @xmath169 but it is under local weyl and the physical meaning of this symmetry we have explained earlier .",
    "it might look surprising that the weyl current @xmath170 has nothing to do with the energy - momentum tensor but this is as it should be .",
    "the weyl transformations are abelian internal transformations hence no @xmath171 ( a current associated to the non - abelian spatiotemporal group @xmath172 ) could ever appear this way .",
    "the way to obtain the latter is through @xmath173 whose trace is zero on - shell ( @xmath174 ) with no needs to add improvement terms .",
    "the absence of such improvement terms is the effect on @xmath175 we have to expect from local weyl symmetry .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms arranged in two triangular sub - lattices , say @xmath176 and @xmath177 , whose electrons in the @xmath178-bonds belonging to one sublattice can hop to the nearest neighbor sites of the other sublattice .",
    "the electronic properties of graphene are ascribed to these electrons .",
    "the elastic properties , instead , are ascribed to the @xmath49-bonds and involve an energy orders of magnitude stronger than that relative to the @xmath178-bonds .",
    "let us focus on the electronic properties which , in the low - energy approximation , are described by the hamiltonian ( we set @xmath179 ) @xmath180 where @xmath181  ev is the nearest neighbors hopping parameter @xcite ( the next - to - nearest neighbors hopping parameter @xmath182 is taken to be zero , and that is the low - energy approximation ) , @xmath121 ( @xmath183 ) and @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) are anti - commuting annihilation ( creation ) operators for an electron in the @xmath176 sub - lattice and in the @xmath177 sub - lattice , respectively , and all vectors are two - dimensional @xmath186 and @xmath187 , as described in fig .  1 .",

    "from which through customary legendre transformation , @xmath222 , a lagrangian density can be derived .",
    "what is obtained is precisely the scale- and conformal - symmetric massless dirac action in flat space we discussed in the previous section with @xmath223 @xmath224 now , let us suppose that the graphene sheet is",

    "these conformally flat @xmath226s describe graphene sheets of which : ( i ) one is planar , hence intrinsically ( and extrinsically ) flat ; ( ii ) some are non - planar but are in fact intrinsically flat ; ( iii ) some have constant intrinsic curvature ; ( iv ) some have non - constant intrinsic curvature . due to the local weyl invariance in any dimension that we discussed in the previous section , if the dimensionality of the problem was indeed two we would have immediately the result that in each one of the cases ( i)-(iv ) the electronic properties of graphene are described by a conformally trivial system and we could take advantage from this every time .    on the other hand , the correct dimensionality is three because there is time . in the next section",
    "we shall see that the presence of time , the special relativistic - like form of the action and the two - dimensional conformal flatness of the graphene sheet naturally lead to a general relativistic - like metric , namely a 2 + 1 dimensional conformally flat metric , including the truly curved .",
    "we resort to such a discovery while asking the question : is there a particular shape of the two - dimensional sheet that gives raise to a conformally trivial dirac system also in _ three _ dimensions , i.e. including time ?",
    "we postpone the answer to the next section as we want to come back now to the effect of local weyl invariance on the density of states of graphene .    for graphene , the quantum version of the local weyl invariance discussed in general in the previous section can have striking consequences .",
    "first we notice that the electronic ldos can be written in terms of the two - point function @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath228 where @xmath229 stands for a generic green function ( @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath145 or @xmath232 of the previous section ) and to obtain its energy dependence it is customary to move to the hamiltonian form of the dirac propagator , formally : @xmath233 .",
    "then we need to apply the general discussion to the case of graphene , by first asking whether it makes sense to have a truly 2 + 1 dimensional conformally flat situation for graphene .",
    "as said we shall face this problem in detail in the following section but we anticipate that the answer is `` yes '' .",
    "thus , what is left to do is to identify the metric and define the corresponding measuring procedure such that @xmath234 and the ldos for the planar sheet is the same as that for a curved sheet when the two - dimensional curvature is such that the 2 + 1 dimensional metric is conformally flat .",
    "the two - dimensional sheet in immersed in a three - dimensional space @xmath235 .",
    "one can easily set the frame so that the profile of the sheet is @xmath236 . including time",
    "then we have the extrinsic frame @xmath237 and the intrinsic frame @xmath238 , where flat ( @xmath239 ) and curved ( @xmath240 ) indices need to be noticed .",
    "the ( standard ) induced metric procedure gives for the 2 + 1 dimensional system the metric @xmath241 where the choice of four dimensional flat metric , @xmath242 , is dictated by the special relativistic - like form of the action , we just need to remember that the limiting speed for the electronic system is @xmath1 and not @xmath2 , all the rest goes through . with this choice for @xmath243 and @xmath244 the electrons on graphene",
    "see a _ spacetime _",
    "metric of the form @xmath245 where @xmath227 are the spatial two - dimensional indices and @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",
    "this we call the `` nearly two - dimensional '' _ ansatz _ because , although the metric @xmath249 is indeed three - dimensional , the curvature content appears to be all in the two - dimensional spatial part . to see it one first notices that the scalar curvatures for @xmath249 and @xmath250 are equal @xmath251 and then that the ricci tensors for the two metrics are such that @xmath252 these results are due to the _ ansatz _ ( [ nearly2d ] ) . on the other hand in any three - dimensional space the riemann tensor ( the tensor that bears the full information on curvature )",
    "@xmath253 is proportional to @xmath254 and @xmath255 as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath256 while in any two - dimensional space ( see the appendix ) @xmath257 thus , from the results ( [ r3=r2])-([ricci2 ] ) we see that the whole information on the curvature of the three - dimensional spacetime with metric ( [ nearly2d ] ) is actually in the two - dimensional scalar curvature @xmath258 , i.e. the riemann tensor only has one independent component , a fact that characterizes two - dimensions , for us the @xmath259 space of the sheet .",
    "this , apparently , means that everything related to curvature is happening in the two - dimensional spatial part and we have built on purpose such a situation to be in the most conservative position : ( i ) no curvature on the time part , ( ii ) the metrics only depend on @xmath43 and @xmath260 .    our goal is to see whether a conformally flat @xmath249 makes sense .",
    "namely , we want to see whether by imposing the conditions for three - dimensional conformal flatness we obtain a reasonable condition for the shape of the two - dimensional graphene sheet .",
    "if that happens then we could reverse the argument and say that for such a shape the three - dimensional metric is indeed conformally flat , including the time part of it , hence we would be in a truly general relativistic - like system , although conformally trivial",
    ". what could happen ( and we were expecting to happen ! ) is that only flat sheets would be allowed .",
    "this case is also of interest , as we shall show , because we are focusing on the intrinsic geometric properties , hence , e.g. , a shape like that in fig .",
    "[ 3dacosnx ] is flat . on the other hand",
    "if flat two - dimensional sheets were the only solution then the only conformally flat @xmath249 would be the flat metric @xmath261 .    .",
    "this profile gives raise to a flat 2 + 1 dimensional metric in the appropriate coordinates . ]",
    "our problem becomes that of solving the third order partial differential equations @xmath262 where @xmath263 is ( proportional to ) the so - called cotton tensor @xcite @xcite and its vanishing is necessary and sufficient condition for a three - dimensional metric to be conformally flat . in four dimensions",
    "this would not be true as it is the vanishing of the weyl tensor that gives the necessary and sufficient condition for the conformal flatness .",
    "the latter tensor is identically zero in three dimensions , and this is why the riemann tensor takes the form ( [ riemannthree ] ) .",
    "the task to solve the partial differential equations ( [ cotton1 ] ) may become very difficult , hence we turned to the help of the package for mathematica in @xcite . with that we have tried with the general profile @xmath264 with @xmath265 integers ( see fig .",
    "[ 3dacosnxcosmy ] ) that could well simulate the ripples found on suspended graphene @xcite , in the hope to find some values of the amplitudes @xmath266 and/or of the frequencies @xmath267 for which ( [ cotton1 ] ) has solutions , besides the flat solutions @xmath268 and @xmath269 .    ) with @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "we can not tell whether there is a choice of @xmath272 such that this kind of profiles give raise to a conformally flat 2 + 1 dimensional metric . ]",
    "the task revealed itself to be beyond the capabilities of the program and/or of the machine .",
    "thus we resorted to approach the problem using the general argument that , for any given profile @xmath236 , there exists a coordinate system on the sheet , say it @xmath273 , such that @xmath274 . to find",
    "such coordinate transformation is surely possible in principle but could be tricky in practice ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some examples in a 2 + 1 dimensional case ) , but the differential equations ( [ cotton1 ] ) surely become much more tractable .",
    "first , in the coordinates @xmath273 the metric ( [ nearly2d ] ) becomes @xmath275 with this equations ( [ cotton1 ] ) become @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the flat space two - dimensional laplace operator .",
    "now we compute @xmath258 in these coordinates and find ( see the appendix ) @xmath278 by using ( [ rsigma ] ) in ( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) we obtain that the request for @xmath249 in ( [ cfnearly2d ] ) to be conformally flat amounts to have a two - dimensional sheet with constant intrinsic curvature @xmath258 .",
    "this , in terms of the two - dimensional conformal factor @xmath49 , amounts to have @xmath279 with _ constant _ gaussian curvature @xmath280 .",
    "we wrote the condition on the @xmath49 in this fashion because this way it is easy to recognize it as a classic equation of the geometry of two - dimensional surfaces @xcite , @xcite , namely _",
    "liouville s equation _ @xcite . among the advantages of having such a classic equation",
    "as our constraint is that all solutions are known @xcite , see also @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus we have found that _ for any graphene sheet that is truly curved , but with constant @xmath281 , the electrons see a truly curved , but conformally flat , three - dimensional spacetime_. to explicitly see it one needs to find a third coordinate frame , now involving time ( as in principle we can not and should not exclude it ) such that @xmath282 with @xmath283 only in the trivial case of constant @xmath49 ( and @xmath284 ) .",
    "when the two - dimensional spatial metric is such that the liouville equation ( [ liouville ] ) is satisfied , we have the `` most gentle '' general relativistic - like situation we could think of , namely the conformally trivial one .",
    "so , while on the one hand , this means that many characteristics of the flat case are untouched in the conformally trivial case ( as we explained before ) , on the other hand _ some _ features will be general relativistic - like and this , in turn , opens the doors to speculate whether more general settings of this kind are meaningful for the physics of electrons on graphene . on the latter ( `` exotic '' ) scenario",
    "we will briefly comment in the last section .",
    "let us now look more closely at the rich landscape that the constraint ( [ liouville ] ) opens - up .    when @xmath285 we are in the particular case of flat sheets , that clearly gives flat three - dimensional metrics .",
    "in this case the @xmath49s permitted are all the infinite solutions of the laplace equation @xmath286 that , as well known , are the harmonic functions in two dimensions .",
    "it is also well known that in the complex domain , @xmath287 and @xmath288 , when @xmath289 and @xmath290 obey the cauchy - riemann conditions for analyticity , @xmath291 and @xmath292 , then they are also harmonic functions .",
    "this means that that are infinite ways we can bend the graphene sheet by keeping it intrinsically flat , the representative of one possible family is given in fig .",
    "[ 3dacosnx ] , and that this infinite family has tight links with the infinite dimensional virasoro algebra , the algebra of the conformal group in two dimensions , with generators @xmath293 , even if we are dealing with a three - dimensional spacetime . on these matters",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . of course",
    ", to bend the graphene sheet it costs elastic energy even though the shape reached is intrinsically flat .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the elastic energy , there is no such a thing as a family of invariant shapes .",
    "what is invariant instead is the way the electrons behave within the intrinsically flat sheets : for them there is no distinction among members of the class .    if we are able to find the coordinate transformation @xmath294 that gives the relation between the @xmath49 of the two - dimensional metric ( [ cfnearly2d ] ) and the @xmath295 of the three - dimensional metric ( [ 3dcfnearly2d ] ) we would explicitly see how the virasoro algebra , that surely is there for @xmath49 , enters the three - dimensions via @xmath295",
    "this is an interesting mathematical problem on its own and deserves more studies @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is relative to true curvature for a honeycomb lattice structure as the one we have in mind here . as well known , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite , for such a lattice the curvature can only enter via the appearance of a defect , a fivefold one to have a positive @xmath281 , a sevenfold one to have a negative @xmath281 .",
    "we have not taken this into account in this paper ( but shall face this in follow - up work @xcite , @xcite ) hence , in this respect , we are considering the graphene sheet as a continuum .",
    "nonetheless , we want to notice here that if a `` no - defect condition '' is imposed on true graphene then there is no way out to have flat sheets and this , in turn , is not as a limiting situation as one might think because the number of allowed shapes is still infinite ( and related to the virasoro algebra ) .",
    "thus , within our approximation of curvature not due to defects , the next case to consider is the constant @xmath281 .",
    "if we once more move to the complex domain equation ( [ liouville ] ) becomes @xmath296 with @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "the general solutions are @xcite @xmath299 with @xmath300 any analytic function , hence , again , an infinite family of solutions like for the harmonic functions . in this case",
    "as well this typically two - dimensional rich structure is enjoyed by a three - dimensional system but to clearly see how this is reflected on the three - dimensional @xmath295 one needs to find the coordinate transformations @xcite @xmath294 .",
    "nonetheless , this intriguing structure underlays our problem and should be explored carefully in relation to possible applications to graphene @xcite .",
    "for instance , vortices have been studied in the context of graphene from various perspectives , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and we can add to those a new one by considering that among the solutions ( [ solliouv ] ) there are ( non - topological ) vortex solutions @xcite given by @xmath301 , with @xmath11 positive integer to which corresponds @xmath302 where @xmath303 .",
    "current work is devoted to find the actual profile @xmath236 corresponding to those solutions and the impact on the density of states @xcite .",
    "we can then conclude that , within the approximations explained throughout the paper - like special relativistic behavior , one crucial approximation here is that curvature is not introduced via disclination defects , hence , in this respect we are treating the lattice as a continuum . ] , when the graphene sheet has a constant gaussian curvature the three - dimensional spacetime the electrons move in is conformally flat and truly curved in all directions , including time , i.e. they experience a truly general relativistic environment . nonetheless , due to the local weyl symmetry enjoyed by the massless dirac theory , these effects can not be seen classically nor quantum - mechanically , unless `` non - invariant measurements '' are performed .",
    "geometrically , by `` invariant measurements '' we mean processes of measurement for which times and lengths are given by @xmath304 , hence the significant vacuum expectations are of the kind @xmath305 and , due to the invariance , they are equal to the flat vacuum expectations @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is a generic operator and we use the notation of the last section as for conformal factors . physically , the processes of invariant measurements are related to the kind of spacetime @xmath295 entails .",
    "one consequence of the weyl symmetry leading to this general relativistic behaviors is that the electronic ldos is invariant under the process of curving the graphene sheet , provided , as said , the measurements are of the invariant kind and provided the two - dimensional curvature is compatible with three - dimensional conformal flatness . for these reasons our conclusions in this respect",
    "are not necessarily contradicting the results of @xcite ( see also the more recent @xcite ) .    of course , this paper is only a preliminary step towards a match with experiments .",
    "first , while the flat spacetime relativistic - like description of ( [ actiongrapheneflat ] ) is fully justified from the experimental point of view , the same can not be said for the curved spacetime description of ( [ actiongraphenecurve ] ) and , in general , this is still an open problem .",
    "nevertheless , we have proved here that such curved spacetime description indeed makes sense at least for the ( infinite ) classes of metrics considered here ( which physically correspond to intrinsically flat and constantly intrinsically curved graphene sheets ) . for those metrics ,",
    "if one accepts the flat spacetime description then one must accept also a curved spacetime description , simply because , through a weyl redefinition of the fields , the action is the same .",
    "this was the main motivation behind our trial metric ( [ nearly2d ] ) in the first place : which metric naturally gives a curved spacetime graphene action that reduces to the experimentally sound flat spacetime graphene action ?",
    "second , we need to find the coordinate transformations that give @xmath295 in terms of the two dimensional @xmath49 .",
    "current work is dedicated to this task @xcite . there",
    "we shall , on the one hand , focus on real graphene configurations that can give raise to a three dimensional conformally flat spacetime , on the other hand , we shall be able to appreciate what kind of spacetime is encoded by such bendings ( besides appreciating the lifting to three dimensions of the virasoro and liouville structures @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we shall also propose dedicated experiments ( or at least the use of existing data ) to prove ( or disprove ) at once that the curved space - time action ( [ actiongraphenecurve ] ) indeed describes electronic transport on curved graphene sheet and that weyl - symmetry is truly in place .",
    "it is worth noticing here that , although it will surely be very interesting to see how time is affected in the inner reference frame through @xmath308 , we have already proved here that it is only a matter of a coordinate change ( not a change of reference frame ) to rewrite the metric where @xmath309 , i.e. ( [ nearly2d ] ) , as @xmath310 .",
    "the latter coordinate change always exists if the graphene sheet has constant curvature , and indeed it seems a non - impossible task for the experimentalists to realize such sheets ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an old overview on generic nanomaterials , and @xcite for a more recent work on graphene ) .",
    "once the relevance of conformally flat spacetimes is established , a natural question is whether it makes sense to reverse the logic and consider more general cases of three - dimensional conformally flat spacetimes than those considered here to see which sort of behavior for two - dimensional graphene they correspond to @xcite .",
    "intriguing examples are the celebrated conformally flat black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions found by baados , teitelboim and zanelli @xcite ( btz ) and the kink spacetime of @xcite .",
    "the first case would represent a black hole in a lab @xcite , the second case is worth studying on its own right but also to explore whether fractionalization of fermion number could occur in such topologically non - trivial background @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the latter examples of three - dimensional conformally flat spacetimes are just two among many solutions of the full theory of gravity in three dimensions that was proposed in the early eighties in @xcite and is still under intense investigation ( see @xcite for a recent paper ) .",
    "for that theory the euler - lagrange equations are @xmath311 where all tensors refer to three dimensions and have been defined in the paper ( note that this @xmath312 differs from the one we used in ( [ cotton2 ] ) only by a factor proportional to @xmath313 , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath314 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath315 is a parameter with the dimensions of a mass .",
    "while the first two terms on the left side of ( [ tmgequations ] ) descend from a standard einstein - hilbert action ( hence are the same in any dimension ) , the third term descends from an action that is nonzero only in three dimensions , for @xmath316 . ] and it is called the chern - simons gravitational term @xcite @xmath317 where the christoffel connection can be expressed in terms of the metric , then variations of @xmath318 with respect to @xmath90 give the cotton tensor .",
    "hence , conformally flat spacetimes ( @xmath319 ) are also solutions of the full theory ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "for instance , the kink spacetime mentioned above is a solution of @xmath319 , hence of the full theory , while the btz black hole is a solution of @xmath320 , hence , again , of the full theory and conformally flat .",
    "thus , if we intend to hunt for the weyl invariant configurations of graphene depicted here , we should restrict our interest to this class of solutions of ( [ tmgequations ] ) and answer , case by case , the questions about shapes , invariant measuring procedures , invariance of the density of states , etc .",
    "notice that , in general , @xmath319 does not give the constraint of eqs .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) , hence also _ nonconstant _ gaussian curvature of the two - dimensional sheet could give raise to a 2 + 1 dimensional conformally flat spacetime , hence to a weyl invariant density of states .",
    "one crucial issue not considered here is about the constraints on the shapes set by the elastic properties of the graphene sheet .",
    "for instance , in our model , there is no limitation to the amplitudes of the intrinsically flat @xmath321 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) besides the obvious limitations arising from the finite size of the sheet ( for a square sheet of side @xmath322 , @xmath323 with @xmath324 ) . these inputs can only come from the elastic ( and dominant ) part of the total energy .",
    "one direction to investigate , then , is to construct a gravity / elastic theory of the graphene sheet along the lines of what has been done in @xcite and @xcite , but introducing a further element in that construction that is the elastic counterpart of the chern - simons gravitational term ( [ cschris ] ) @xcite . of course to this end we need to revisit our analysis because disclination defects are necessary to have a nonzero curvature .",
    "nonetheless , if the defects are few and localized ( for instance only 12 five - folded defects are necessary to have a sphere ) and the graphene sample is large enough , the analysis presented here should still apply , although less rigorously .",
    "let us close this paper with a speculation on the nature of ripples @xcite-@xcite . since it costs extra energy to create a defect it seems reasonable to ask whether ripples are intrinsically flat .",
    "we could exactly answer this question by using the techniques and invariance ( classical and quantum ) presented here with no approximations because the spacetime is flat : if ripples are intrinsically flat the density of states would be fully invariant , while its non - invariant behavior would be simply due to a coordinate choice effect ( not to an observer effect ) and , furthermore , the profile @xmath236 would correspond to a two - dimensional conformal factor @xmath325 that is an harmonic function @xcite .",
    "i am indebted to siddhartha sen who suggested to me that weyl symmetry could be relevant for the physics of graphene in the first place , and discussed with me on the density of states and other matters .",
    "i thank petr jizba , gaetano lambiase , antonello scardicchio and martin ofka for useful interactions and sotirios bonanos for providing for free a high quality calculation tool for geometric tensors .    as usual , in @xmath11 dimension , @xmath326_{- } v_\\lambda = { r^\\rho}_{\\lambda \\mu \\nu } v_\\rho - { t^\\rho}_{\\mu \\nu } \\nabla_\\rho v_\\lambda \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath327 and the riemann and torsion tensors are @xmath328 \\lambda } + { \\gamma^\\rho}_{[\\nu \\sigma } { \\gamma^\\sigma}_{\\mu ] \\lambda } \\ ; ,      \\quad     { t^\\rho}_{\\mu \\nu } = { \\gamma^\\rho}_{[\\mu \\nu ] } \\;,\\ ] ] respectively . by using @xmath329 , which descends from @xmath330 ,",
