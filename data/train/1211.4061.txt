    "rossi s early work , up to the end of 1930s  beginning of 1940s , has already been discussed by the author in @xcite and especially in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , apart from some aspects which have not been particularly stressed in these articles , the present work will pay more attention to rossi s involvement in the beginning of space science and in particular in the birth of x - ray astronomy , as such issues strongly related to the main focus of this contribution have never been discussed in more detail within the context of rossi s whole scientific activity , except for descriptions contained in the above mentioned biographical sources .",
    "apart from the scientific literature , the reconstruction is mainly based on original documents from rossi s papers preserved at mit archives and on research reports of the time , as well as on personal recollections from rossi s collaborators interviewed by the author . ]",
    "born in venice in 1905 , bruno rossi studied at the university of padua , and received his laurea degree in physics at the university of bologna in november 1927 . in early 1928 he got a position at the university of florence as assistant professor of antonio garbasso , the director of the physics institute located on the hill of arcetri , not far from the house where galileo galilei lived part of his life and died in 1642 .    during his first two years in arcetri ,",
    "rossi s research had no clear focus ; then a paper by walther bothe and werner kolhrster on the nature of the extraterrestrial penetrating radiation appeared @xcite , which was < < like a flash of light revealing the existence of an unsuspected world , full of mysteries , which no one had yet begun to explore > > @xcite .    at the end of 1920s",
    "particle physics was on the verge of emerging < < out of the turbulent confluence of three initially distinct bodies of research : nuclear physics , cosmic - ray studies , and quantum field theory > > ( * ? ? ?",
    "* preface ) .",
    "the `` radiation from above '' had been studied first as a phenomenon linked to atmospheric electricity , and then as a cosmic and geo - physical phenomenon . during the 1920s",
    "the main preoccupation of scientists working on cosmic rays had been to investigate and debate < < the most diverse features of the radiation , such as intensity , distribution , absorption and scattering , and even its origin > > as specified by bothe and kolhrster in the opening lines of their pioneering article on the nature of the `` high - altitude radiation '' @xcite .",
    "however , as the authors duly remarked , <",
    "< the really essential question regarding the _ nature _ of the high - altitude radiation has hitherto found no experimental answer [ italics mine ] .",
    "> >    at that time it had definitely been clarified that cosmic radiation had a penetrating power far exceeding that of the @xmath0-rays emitted by radioactive substances . since @xmath0-rays were known to ionize through the intermediary of secondary charged particles which they generate in matter , it was expected that cosmic @xmath0-rays traveling through matter would be accompanied by a flow of `` soft '' secondary electrons resulting from the compton effect , which were presumed to be the ionizing agent recorded by the measuring instruments .",
    "a direct study of this corpuscular radiation could thus clarify the nature of cosmic rays .",
    "up to that time , absorption measurement carried out with highly sensitive ionization chambers had been a main tool for the study of the penetrating radiation .",
    "but at the end of the 1920s , brand - new instruments were being developed that opened the door to the investigation of the physical properties of the local radiation , thus starting a real revolution in cosmic ray experimental studies and transforming it into a completely new research field .",
    "a novel counting tube had just been developed in kiel by geiger and his pupil william mller @xcite who had announced their invention on 7 july 1928 , during a meeting of the german physical society .    in their landmark paper @xcite",
    "published in the fall of 1929 bothe and kolhrster reported on their measurements of the absorption of those hypothetical `` secondary electrons '' by recording the coincidences between two superimposed geiger - mller counters interleaved with metal plates of increasing thickness.http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/bothe-lecture.html@xmath1 .",
    "] however , since compton electrons have a low penetrating power , they should be completely absorbed by a very thin layer of gold . to their great surprise they found that 76% of the charged particles present in the cosmic radiation near sea level could penetrate 4.1 centimeters of gold . from this arrangement",
    "they argued that the radiation traversing the two counters within a fixed time coincidences could not have the nature of a secondary radiation resulting from the compton effect generated by the ultra-@xmath0-radiation .",
    "they thus suggested that the penetrating rays , at that time believed to be of primary origin , consisted of ionizing particles , and that the ionizing particles observed near sea level were those among the primary particles _ that were capable of traversing the atmosphere_.    actually , their counter experiments did not really prove that the _ primary _ rays were corpuscular , and their latter hypothesis turned out later not to be correct , but at the time it had a role in defining the astrophysical and the physical aspects of the cosmic - ray problem .",
    "it was still difficult to accept that corpuscles could have the high energies which were necessary to enable them to penetrate the atmosphere .    the pioneering experiments carried out by bothe and kolhrster during the period 19281929 @xcite @xcite @xcite following the advent of the geiger - mller counter in the spring of 1928 , marked the end of the first period of cosmic - ray research .",
    "bruno rossi in florence quickly realized that this kind of physics could be performed in a terrestrial laboratory and that the geiger - mller counter could become the key to open < < a window upon a new , unknown territory , with unlimited opportunities for explorations > > @xcite .",
    "he was 24 years old when < < one of the most exhilarating periods > > of his life began @xcite . in just a few months he built his own geiger - mller counters , devised a new method for recording coincidences @xcite , and began some experiments .    whereas the invention of the geiger - mller counter represented the opening of `` a new technological window '' , the setting up of the coincidence circuit , a real _ telescope _ for cosmic rays , constituted a giant leap forward , turning into what it is to be considered the very _ first act _ of rossi s research program .",
    "@xmath2-fold version of the electronic coincidence circuit changed radically the view of cosmic rays .",
    "it greatly reduced the rate of chance coincidences , thus allowing observations with increased statistical weight .",
    "the time correlation among associated particles crossing different counters could be established , and the possibility of arranging more counters , in whatever geometrical configuration , eventually opened new possibilities of investigation .    in following bothe s intuition on the importance of coincidence methods , rossi s style of work is to be highlighted as exemplary in establishing the `` logic '' research tradition @xcite which paved the way for future investigations .",
    "by wisely arranging metal screens and circuits of counters according to different geometrical configurations , rossi was enacting a definite project which since the very first moment aimed at demonstrating the corpuscular nature of cosmic rays , opposing the view that considered them as high frequency @xmath0-rays @xcite @xcite .- rays , from the energy set free in the synthesis of heavier atoms through fusion of primeval hydrogen atoms @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite . for an accurate reconstruction of millikan s strategy for measuring cosmic ray energy , and his theories on the origin of cosmic rays see ( * ? ? ? * ch .",

    "by the summer 1931 rossi had performed a series of experiments ( deviation with an electromagnet @xcite and study of intensity of cosmic rays with a counter - telescope at different inclinations to the vertical line @xcite , aiming with different means at studying the nature and behaviour of the cosmic rays .",
    "leaving aside the cosmological and planetary scenario of the first two decades of the 20th century , rossi wondered : < < _ what is the nature and behavior of this radiation _ ?",
    "> > and in so doing , he was definitely entering the field of microscopic physics .",
    "his early researches must be in fact examined on the background of a wider perspective regarding the study of the interaction between radiation , particles and matter , a problem strictly intermingled with the debate over @xmath3-decay , behavior of electrons as @xmath3-particles , as well as difficulties in considering the nucleus as a quanto - mechanical system made up of protons and electrons .",
    "cosmic rays , freely delivered by nature , appeared in fact to be highly relevant to fundamental problems of physics .",
    "rossi discovered that cosmic - ray particles could pass through enormously thick matter , including up to a meter of lead .",
    "his findings gave evidence of the astonishing energies associated with cosmic rays . on december 16 , 1931",
    ", he sent a short letter to _ die naturwissenschaften _ @xcite : < < a fairly large proportion of the corpuscular radiation found at sea level has still the capability of traversing more than 1 m lead , that is about more than the thickness of the whole atmosphere .",
    "> >    as a matter of fact , the real hot issue was the production of secondary radiation generated in the metal shield above the counters whose first hints rossi had already observed during his experiments in berlin in summer 1930 , when he had been invited by bothe @xcite . in fall 1931",
    "rossi started a systematic research using arrangements of three non aligned gm - counters , in conjunction with his threefold coincidence circuit .",
    "the counters were placed inside a thick lead shield in order to avoid any effects caused by external radioactivity . by removing the upper part of the shield the counting rate",
    "was significantly reduced , thus affording direct evidence for the occurrence of processes , which resulted in the production of one or more secondary particles by a cosmic ray traversing the matter @xcite .",
    "however , no known process at the time could explain the abundant production of secondary particles revealed by his experiments . ]    after the discovery of the production of secondary radiations in metal shields , rossi had continued his investigations going much deeper into the origin of this unexpected phenomenon .",
    "such unpredicted behavior of the radiation found its confirming synthesis in a curve which was to be universally known as the _ rossi transition curve _",
    ", representing the variation of the number of coincidences recorded by three counters in a triangular array as a function of the thickness ( in mass per unit area ) of layers of lead and iron placed above them and emitting the secondary particles @xcite .",
    "rossi s relevant investigations performed during the period 19311932 pointed to the existence of two components in cosmic rays at sea level : a  hard \" component , able to pass through 1 m of lead after being filtered through a 10 cm thick lead screen , and a  soft \" component , generated in the atmosphere by primary cosmic rays and able to generate groups of particles in a metal screen before being stopped .",
    "other absorption measurements on cosmic ray particles had shown the existence of these two components ; however , rossi s experiments were the first to prove that the hard and soft rays were fundamentally different in character and did not differ merely in their energy .",
    "actually , the rossi transition curve drops much more rapidly than the absorption curve of cosmic rays at sea level . according to rossi ,",
    "this phenomenon was due to the fact that what they called at the time `` primary '' radiation , is in part composed of softer corpuscles of _ secondary origin _ generated in the atmosphere or in the ceiling of the room and totally absorbed in a few centimeters lead , thus contributing to a steeper slope than expected .",
    "> > @xcite.[slantrays ] ]    he was thus able to conclude that : < < _ [  ] the soft components , and not the hard components of the corpuscular incoming radiation , more actively contribute to the production of secondary radiation .",
    "_ > > @xcite rossi remarked that what he had previously assumed to be a _",
    "secondary _ radiation generated in metal shields by `` primary '' cosmic rays at sea level , was in fact a < < _ _ tertiary _ _ radiation producing most of the observed threefold coincidences observed with 1 cm lead > > and that the soft radiation he had observed < < along strongly slanting directions > > which he considered < < practically all of secondary origin , > > was at the root of such phenomenon @xcite .",
    "@xcite , they hypothesized that < < the shower - producing radiation can not be considered a secondary radiation of the cosmic corpuscles [ the penetrating component ] > > thus concluding that it must be part of what at the time was considered the `` primary cosmic radiation . '' ]    a long paper discussing in detail results on such issues was submitted to the _ zeitschrift fr physik _ in february 1933 @xcite .",
    "in the meantime , after his early attempts in analyzing the corpuscles reaction in presence of an electromagnet @xcite @xcite , rossi used the earth magnetic field as a spectrometer @xcite .",
    "if primary cosmic rays were charged particles as were showing the above mentioned results they would also be affected by the geomagnetic field before entering into the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "latitude effect _ was actually expected indicating a lower intensity of cosmic rays near the equator , where the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field is stronger , but evidence from experiments did not convince the scientific community . on july 3 , 1930",
    "rossi submitted a paper @xcite in which he conjectured the existence of an _ east - west effect _ , a second geomagnetic effect which would be revealed by an asymmetry of the cosmic - ray intensity with respect to the plane of the geomagnetic meridian , with more particles coming from east or west , depending on whether the particle charge was negative or positive .",
    "after a first negative attempt at arcetri , rossi started planning this experiment in eritrea , in the proximity of asmara , the capital of the italian colony rising at an altitude of 2370 m , and at a geomagnetic latitude of 11@xmath4 30 n. in the vicinity of the equator the effect would be clearly observable .",
    "owing to slow arrival of funds he was able to leave only in the autumn of 1933 , thus losing the priority of this important discovery .",
    "when he reported the preliminary positive results of his observation @xcite , articles confirming his prediction had already been published by arthur h. compton and louis w. alvarez @xcite , and by thomas johnson @xcite .",
    "the study of the asymmetry predicted by rossi , in confirming the corpuscular nature of the `` primary radiation '' , also revealed that they were mostly positively charged .",
    "the result was quite surprising because the supporters of the corpuscular theory were convinced , more < < from prejudice than because of a logical argument , > > that the primary particles would turn out to be electrons @xcite .",
    "as a by product of his experiments in eritrea rossi observed an unexpected phenomenon @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the frequency of the coincidences recorded with the counters at a distance from one another , shown in the tables as `` chance '' coincidences appears to be greater than would have been predicted on the basis of the resolving power of the coincidence circuit .",
    "those observations made us question whether all of these coincidences were actually chance coincidences [  ] since the interference of possible disturbances was ruled out by suitable tests , it seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by _ very extensive showers _ of particles , which cause coincidences between counters , even placed at large distances from one another . and `` sciami '' , a term corresponding to `` swarms '' , generally used for a great number of insects like bees , and which since then was used by italian cosmic - ray physicists .",
    "however , the word `` shower '' had just been coined by blackett and occhialini , the first to visualize the phenomenon of a spray in fine streams of particle tracks in their cloud chamber triggered by an electronic circuit . ]",

    "_ that these counter experiments never in my judgment actually measure the absorption coefficients of anything_. > > millikan did not mention rossi s experiments , which were in fact the main target of his criticism , as rossi , since the beginning of his activity in cosmic - rays researches , had been the principal proponent of the corpuscular hypothesis . ]    however , it is also to be remarked that at the end of 1933 the complex nature and the mechanisms underlying the whole phenomenon of `` cosmic rays '' was far from being clarified , even if the experiments on geomagnetic effects had definitely provided a proof of their corpuscular nature , and the existence of the positron had just been connected by patrick m. s. blackett and rossi s student giuseppe occhialini to dirac s theory of the relativistic electron and to the mechanism of pair production .",
    "patrick m. blackett and occhialini @xcite had in fact used rossi s coincidence circuit to trigger the expansion of a cloud chamber . with this new device , a perfect fusion of `` image '' and `` logic '' @xcite , they were able to `` see '' the groups of particles whose existence rossi had clearly demonstrated in his experiments as some sort of a `` rain '' in the cloud - chamber , hence they named them `` showers '' . in their second paper @xcite , blackett and",
    "occhialini pointed out that the occurrence of these tracks was a well known feature of cosmic radiation and was < < clearly related to the various secondary processes occurring when penetrating radiation passes through matter .",
    "> > they also credited rossi for having been the first to investigate these secondary particles using counters and were able to confirm the interpretation proposed by anderson about the existence of a < < positively charged particle having a mass comparable with that of an electron > > @xcite , but they also placed the positron the `` dirac hole - theory particle'' into theoretical perspective .",
    "blackett and occhialini were the first to expound the pair formation mechanism derived from experiments , which was the process underlying the formation of electromagnetic showers , one of the most striking facts of the phenomenology related to cosmic rays .",
    "but only starting from 1934 , with the bethe - heitler s landmark paper `` on the stopping of fast particles and on the creation of positive electrons '' @xcite , discussing in detail the energy loss of charged particles passing through matter based on the dirac equation , views on cosmic - ray phenomena really began to change .    in the period when understanding of the interaction between cosmic rays and matter was far from clear and quantum electrodynamics appeared to break down at the high energies involved in cosmic rays , experiments using counters became one of the fundamental tools for testing the new physics .",
    "a theory providing a natural and simple explanation on the basis of the quantum electrodynamics cross - sections calculated by bethe and heitler appeared in early 1937 in simultaneous papers by j.  franklin carlson and j.  robert oppenheimer @xcite , and by homi bhabha and walter heitler @xcite . the theory explaining shower formation and the identification of the hard component with a brand - new particle , the mesotron , resurrected relativistic quantum field theory toward the end of the 1930s @xcite @xcite .",
    "the core of the theory was the explanation of the activity regarding the soft part of cosmic rays , the unequivocal success of quantum electrodynamics , which nevertheless left unsolved the study of the hard component leaving it as a challenge for the future .    in parallel with theoretical clarifying of the shower formation , which clearly connected creation of showers in matter to the existence of similar phenomena in the atmosphere , georg pfotzer had concluded that soft rays observed at low level were to be considered as branches of showers produced high in the atmosphere by incoming cosmic - ray particles @xcite .",
    "these opinions were confirmed in the concluding section an article published by pierre auger and paul ehrenfest jr . in 1937",
    "@xcite . in starting their study on the two components of different nature discovered by rossi , auger and his collaborators made systematical researches on the showers produced by soft cosmic rays in matter .",
    "they had been led to extend the study to distances of several tens of meters , progressively arranging counters more and more wide apart in order to reveal more and more dispersed atmospheric showers .",
    "they explored the production of large atmospheric showers ( < < grandes gerbes cosmiques > > ) , whose branches could be separated by a distance of several meters , and whose origin they thought should be < < very high in the atmosphere > > @xcite . in comparing such showers to those",

    "same 1938 , kolhrster and collaborators reported about coincidences recorded between two counters separated by distances going up to 10 m , and remarked that these observations must be related to < < secondary rays of the high - altitude radiation , i.e. to a shower [ schauer ] > > @xcite",
    ".    a summary of the french group systematic researches on the extensive air showers appeared in an article published on the _ reviews of modern physics _",
    ", where they discussed the extension of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays up to the incredible energy of 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "one of the consequences was actually that it appeared < < actually impossible to imagine a single process able to give to a particle such an energy > > @xcite .",
    "auger and his collaborators were since then credited for the discovery of eas , and all this inaugurated the great season of speculations on the origin of cosmic rays which is still an open question nowadays .",
    "supported by enrico fermi , rossi had won a competition for the chair of experimental physics and worked in padua from 1932 to 1938 . at this time , after having just completed his work overseeing the design and construction of the new physics institute , he was rewarded by being denied the right to work there because he was a jew .",
    "when the anti - semitic laws enacted by the fascist regime of benito mussolini passed in italy , rossi was dismissed and had to emigrate from his country with his young bride nora lombroso .    they left italy in september 1938 .",
    "after a short stay in copenhagen at niels bohr s institute , rossi was invited by patrick blackett in manchester , and in june 1939 he moved to the united states on an invitation of arthur h. compton .    in the period 19391942 rossi conducted with different collaborators a series of experiments on the decay of the first unstable particle which had been discovered in cosmic rays in 19361937 , the @xmath9 meson , or `` mesotron '' of cosmic rays , as this particle was then called .",
    "these experiments produced the final proof of the radioactive instability of the mesotron , established a precise value for its mean life , and , as a by - product , verified for the very first time the time dilation of _ moving clocks _ predicted by einstein relativity theory @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . by 1942 the evidence for the decay of the mesotron at the end of their range had changed from the first two cloud - chamber tracks photographed by williams and roberts in 1940 @xcite to the curve presented by rossi and nereson , which contained thousands of decay events and showed an exponential decay with a lifetime of about 2 @xmath9s @xcite .",
    "the style and elegance of these achievements have been unanimously recognized in the history of experimental physics .",
    "these experiments , completed by rossi during the war , symbolically closed an era that he himself called <",
    "< the age of innocence of the experimental physics of elementary particles > > @xcite .",
    "it was still a time when fundamental results could be obtained through extraordinarily simple experiments , which cost a few thousand dollars , and which required the help of one or two young graduates .    the years from 1939 to 1943 form a self - contained period of rossi s personal life and of his scientific activity .",
    "it began with his arrival in the united states , as an exile from fascism , and ended with his shifting from the peace - time work at cornell university to the war - time work at los alamos .",
    "from the late spring of 1943 , he participated to the manhattan project at los alamos where the best brains were gathered to work on research aiming at the production of nuclear weapons . with hans staub he was responsible for development of detectors for nuclear experiments .",
    "their _ fast ionization chamber _ was used in a series of tests conducted by rossi that verified the implosion method for detonating the plutonium bomb and in a measurement he made of the exponential growth of the chain reaction in the trinity test , the first ever nuclear explosion , on july 16 , 1945 .",
    "the importance rossi had acquired within the american scientific context can also be measured by the offer of a position at the massachusetts institute of technology at the end of the war .",
    "he moved there in early 1946 and established the cosmic ray group at the laboratory for nuclear science and engineering .",
    "excited by the return to the active research and by the possibility to form a new generation of researchers , he started to think on a grand scale , relying on the large economic resources which physicists had at their disposal after the scientific and technological achievements of war research .",
    "modern elementary particle physics as such , was on the verge of becoming an independent field , but still strongly depending on cosmic ray research , whose instruments consisted largely of cloud chambers , ionization chambers , nuclear emulsions and counters , of course .",
    "an impressive research program aimed to study the production of mesons , their interaction with matter , and their decay process by all possible means , included high - altitude mountain experiments , airplane measurements and the study of giant cosmic ray showers of the atmosphere , which would become one of the mit cosmic - ray group s strongest research fields .",
    "at the same time , the problem of the identity of primary cosmic rays was tackled by means of suitable ionization chambers and amplifiers , carried by balloons .",
    "this vast and complex program on cosmic rays and elementary particles saw rossi surrounded by an increasing number of young researchers , often coming from abroad to enrich the cultural circle within the local scientific community .",
    "up to the middle of the 1950s the `` little science '' program carried out by the cosmic ray physicists with counters , cloud chambers and nuclear emulsions , continued to be competitive with and even to dominate the `` big science '' of particle physics carried out using accelerators .",
    "but since some time rossi s interest in the primary cosmic radiation had been aroused by experiments carried out toward the end of the 1940s . at that time",
    ", the secondary processes occurring in the atmosphere and generating the various components of the local radiation ( penetrating component , shower - producing component , nuclear - active component ) had been clarified , but cosmic - ray research was undergoing a radical change .    on the one hand , in 1940 balloon experiments by schein and co - workers @xcite using complex geiger - mller counter arrangements , and in 1948 balloon experiments using nuclear emulsions @xcite",
    "@xcite , had solved the problem concerning the nature of the primary cosmic radiation , three decades after hess seminal discovery . by 1950",
    "the main features of the composition of primary cosmic rays were thus known .    on the other hand , since the 1930s the potential importance of cosmic rays for astrophysics had been pointed out .",
    "research on the primaries began thus to stir up questions connected with the origin of cosmic rays , but at the moment problems related to nuclear interactions were still overwhelming .",
    "in fact , as recalled by rossi , the discovery of the strange particles and the attempts < < to establish their nature and behavior became one of the most fascinating and demanding activities of our group > > @xcite . at that time",
    "the activities of the mit group were in fact divided between experiments on cosmic rays and experiments with accelerators .",
    "at the beginning of the 1950s a semblance of order began to appear , but a much deeper understanding of nuclear forces still needed a lot of ingenuity both by theorists , and by accelerator experimenters and cosmic - ray physicists . in this period ,",
    "the mit cosmic ray group and the cole politechnique group led by louis leprince - ringuet had a leading role in resolving the charged kaon group .",

    "not only was a major occasion of encounter for the groups involved in the study of elementary particle physics all over the world , but also provided the opportunity for examining the data collected in the previous years in an attempt to clarify a very confused situation in the field .",
    "cosmic ray research and high - energy particle physics were still sharing a remarkable connection , even if the feeling that accelerators were beginning to invade the field began to spread during the bagnres - de - bigorre conference . as recalled by milla baldo ceolin , at the time a young researcher of padua university ,",

    "a giant stack of 250 sheets of emulsions was prepared by a european collaboration .",
    "it had a dimension of @xmath10 cm@xmath5 in order to follow decay products to the end of their ranges , flew for six hours at 27,000 meters of altitude .",
    "the cosmic ray physicists could be proud ; they had found just in time all possible decays of the heavy mesons , and made it very plausible that there was one and only one @xmath12 particle .",
    "the `` wisdom '' and ingenuity of rossi s talk at bagnres de bigorre received a confirmation at the pisa conference in july 1955 .",
    "the g - stack experiment showed that the @xmath12-mesons , having different decay modes , had masses that were equal within a few tenths of 1% .",
    "the last great experiment of cosmic rays in particle physics was signed by 36 authors instead of the few typical of those times .",
    "but their triumph was a swan s song . in the meantime the new generation of machines had begun to produce results comparable to those obtained by cosmic ray physicists . in 1953 the first strange particles produced in laboratory experiments using accelerator beams were observed .",

    "the conclusions reached by auger and his colleagues depended on the statistical analysis of many events , aided by the newly developed theory of electron - photon cascades , while this kind of experiments required detectors whose signals , unlike those of the gm - counters , would be proportional to the numbers of shower particles which had struck them .",

    "the transition to a new stage of rossi s scientific life is testified by his keen interest in the origin of cosmic rays which was becoming a hot problem also because , on the other hand , cosmic ray physicists had now the possibility of studying the composition , the energy spectrum , the time variations and the directions of arrival of primary cosmic rays in an effort to get some clues on their place of origin , on the mechanism responsible for their production , and on the conditions prevailing in the space through which they travel on their way to the earth .",
    "the discovery of the existence of particles characterized by energies much higher than could be previously imagined , had revived the interest for mechanisms able to accelerate cosmic rays at such energies . in 1949",
    "fermi had published a most cited article @xcite where he considered cosmic rays as a gas of relativistic particles moving in the interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "he proposed for the first time a model for the acceleration mechanism responsible for the production of cosmic rays which could be compared with data .    between 1953 and 1954",
    "the origin of cosmic rays had definitely become a hot topic and various theories were published @xcite .",
    "fermi got interested in magnetic galactic fields during discussions with hannes alfvn and especially with subrahmanyan chandrasekhar , and took the occasion to re - examine his earlier ideas about the origin of the cosmic rays in view of later developments in the knowledge of the strength and behavior of the magnetic fields @xcite @xcite . at the time rossi , philip morrison and stanislaw olbert were writing an article on the origin of cosmic rays @xcite , too , so that the issue was discussed in a correspondence which was forcibly interrupted with fermi s premature death in the late autumn of 1954 .",
    "the study of the origin of cosmic rays , in parallel with the interpretation of empirical evidence obtained from properties of the cosmic rays themselves , began to draw as well from general astrophysical means of observation .",
    "the beginning of the 1950s assisted indeed at the birth of cosmic - ray astrophysics .",
    "the connection of primary cosmic rays with chemical and isotopic compositions of matter in the universe , with energy spectra of protons and nuclei , their origin and the mechanisms for their accelerations and the propagation in the interstellar medium , were all problems which provided a foundation for the rising of the concept of cosmic rays as `` astronomical objects '' along with galaxies , stars , interstellar gas etc . @xcite .",
    "the development of more and more sophisticated air showers experiments , in connection with the ongoing evolution of the cosmic - ray problem , certainly represented a strong contribution in redirecting rossi s interest towards phenomena specifically connected to the `` cosmic character '' of the radiation .",
    "a whole era was concluding in his personal line of research , which had opened with his first efforts in providing the proofs of the corpuscular nature of the radiation , until the unveiling of the rich , but still rather confused , universe of particle physics during the 1940s and early 1950s .",
    "magnetic fields , particles generated in the explosion of supernovae , and nuclei of elements expelled by astrophysical objects of unknown nature were more and more crowding the intergalactic space .",
    "at that time only physicists were interested in cosmic rays , their role in astronomy was still completely obscure , mostly because of the high degree of isotropy of the cosmic rays ( ignoring the effect of the magnetic field of the earth ) .",
    "for this reason even the very detailed information available on the composition and the energy spectrum of the cosmic rays on earth said little about the nature and especially about the very location of these sources",

    "observations from the earth had already suggested that the space surrounding our planet is not entirely devoid of matter , as had been supposed in the past , but rather contains a dilute plasma , an ionized gas that was considered presumably consisting of electrons and protons .",
    "the cosmic - ray group at mit had been concerned with this problem because of the possibility suggested by some scientists that certain temporal changes of cosmic - ray intensity might be due to clouds of magnetized plasma ejected by the sun into the surrounding space . at the end of the 1950s most scientists",
    "were thus persuaded that a plasma of solar origin was filling interplanetary space all the way to the earth s orbit and probably beyond . however , the views concerning the properties of this plasma were widely divergent .",
    "the estimates of its density ranged from one to one thousand electrons and protons per cubic centimeter .",
    "some believed that the plasma was nearly stationary , others that it was flowing with a speed of 1000 kilometers per second .",
    "perhaps the plasma was distributed more or less evenly in space ; perhaps it was condensed into clouds .    in parallel with",

    "the conflict between the mutually exclusive ideas of biermann and chapman was actually solved by eugene parker who incorporated both concepts , and placed each in its proper perspective .",
    "he realized that the corona and the solar streams could not be separate entities , and suggested that the inward pressure of the interstellar medium was too weak to allow the solar atmosphere to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , but must expand continually into space filling the whole solar system , and generating a high - velocity radial flow with speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second , which he called `` solar wind '' to distinguish it from the older pictures of a static ` atmosphere ' or a bullet - like ` corpuscular radiation ' .",
    "he suggested that the weakening effect of gravity on the hydrodynamic flow would produce a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow .",
    "2 million k would draw magnetic field lines of force out of the corona far into the solar system and , because of the solar rotation , the resulting interplanetary field would have a spiral pattern in the sun s equatorial plane . ]",
    "parker s paper submitted to the _ astrophysical journal _ in 1958 @xcite , was initially rejected by two referees , and published in the november issue thanks to the then editor subrahmanyan chandrasekhar , as recalled later by parker himself @xcite .",
    "many were skeptical . in criticizing parker s solar - wind idea , joseph chamberlain s model , for example , predicted a tenuous subsonic flow a `` solar breeze'' for the expanding plasma @xcite @xcite .    during the first meeting of rossi s committee on space experiments held in september 1958 ,",
    "it became clear that no experiment had been devised to enquire about the hydromagnetic conditions of space around our planet and the sun  earth relation .",
    "as rossi remarked , < < it was hard to understand why this exploration should not have been included in the early program of nasa > > @xcite . after having reported the problem to the space science board , rossi felt thus motivated to initiate a study of interplanetary plasma with his own group at mit    estimates of the bulk velocity varied from zero ( stationary plasma ) to about 1000 km / s ( solar wind ) . however , in case of a stationary plasma , protons would move at random , with expected kinetic energies of about 80 kev ( in agreement with the temperature of 10@xmath27 k , as observed in the visible corona ) . in the second case",
    ", the protons would move in a nearly parallel beam , with a kinetic energy of about 2.5 kev .",
    "the electrons , because of their higher thermal velocities , would in any case move more or less at random and therefore could not provide any information on the bulk motion of the plasma . therefore",
    ", it was _ necessary to study the proton rather than the electron flux in order to obtain information on the magnitude and the direction of the plasma flow_.    for the first time , physicists were tackling a totally new situation : experiments in space . in these early attempts",
    "it was wise to sacrifice precision to simplicity of design , strength of construction and reliability of operation .",
    "for this reason , rossi proposed to plan the detector starting from the model of a classical , well - tested instrument : the _ faraday cup _",
    ", a metal cup designed to catch charged particles in vacuum , which would measure the positive ion current , and by means of a repelling grid , give an indication of the ion energy .",
    "the most important quantities related to the interplanetary plasma were : spatial distribution of the plasma in the solar system and its variation with time , bulk velocity of the plasma , correlation with solar activity , correlation and association with magnetic fields , composition and plasma `` temperature '' .",

    "a collector plate was to be mounted behind a hole in the skin of the space vehicle and grounded through a resistor .",
    "the hole was to be covered by a plane circular grid , g@xmath28 , kept at the potential of the vehicle s skin ( to be called _ zero potential _ ) , while the collector plate was to be kept at a suitable negative potential . with the cup facing in the direction of the plasma stream",

    "while doing so , however , it would generate a _ reverse _ photoelectric current due to the solar radiation reflected toward it by the collector .",
    "they soon realized that it was not possible to entirely suppress the photoelectric disturbances by adding more grids , because each new grid would have been a new source of photoelectrons .",
    "as recalled by rossi @xcite : <",
    "< clearly , we had to contrive some entirely different method of making the response of our probe insensitive to the photoelectric effect .",
    "it was not an easy problem .",
    "> > they found a satisfactory solution which consisted in _ modulating _ the photoelectric current using a third grid ( the modulating grid g@xmath31 ) whose electric potential oscillated rapidly between zero and some adjustable positive voltage .",
    "the modulating grid , because of a positive square - wave imposed on it , would cut off the flow of protons with energies below a certain value which , for normal incidences , equalled the value of the modulating voltage .",
    "the modulation of the proton flow would produce in the detector circuit an alternating current of an intensity proportional to the modulated part of the proton flux .",
    "photoelectric currents , not subject to modulation , would not affect the measurements .",
    "a further disturbance might arise from a capacity coupling between the modulating grid and the collector .",
    "rossi himself solved this problem inserting another grid , g@xmath30 , directly behind the modulating grid .",
    "while work on the plasma probe was in progress , a group of soviet scientists led by konstantin gringauz had flown their detectors in several missions during 1959 .",
    "in venturing into the interplanetary realm , _ lunik 2 _ and _ lunik 3 _ carried 4 ion traps each with an inner grid held at @xmath32200 v to repel photoelectrons produced by incident radiation and an outer grid which was given different positive or negative potential with respect to the body of the satellite in order to obtain some information on the energy of the plasma particles entering the cup . to + 15 v on _ lunik 1 _ and _ lunik 2 _ , and from @xmath33 to + 25 v on _",

    "the russian scientists were aware that their design did not provide adequate protection against photoelectric interference , nor did it afford the possibility of significant measurements of the proton energies , the two important features that modulation provided for the mit probe .",
    "however , even if it did not measure the speed or direction of the ions , it determined that there was indeed a flux of @xmath34@xmath35s@xmath36 of positive ions ( presumably protons ) . from a comparison of the measurements made with different voltages on the outer grid",

    "nasa named the successfully launched p-14 space probe _",

    "it prepared the stage for the complete vindication of parker s theory of the solar wind .",
    "in fact , what was really required , was a detailed study of the undisturbed solar wind from space on the day side of the earth , or from interplanetary probes .",
    "the _ mariner 2 _ mission launched on august 27 of that same year , carried a plasma probe built by marcia neugebauer and conway snyder of jet propulsion laboratory which could measure the energy spectrum of both electrons and protons .",
    "it observed for the first time the solar wind in free space and definitely confirmed parker s prediction of the supersonic expansion of the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "new and important results concerning interplanetary plasmas and magnetic fields were obtained by means of vehicles reaching farther and farther into interplanetary space and carrying increasingly refined instruments .",
    "rossi s direct involvement in plasma experimentation ended with explorer x. for herbert bridge , instead , it was the start of a long and most fruitful research activity .",
    "the group that grew under herbert bridge s leadership , together with the theoretical group of stan olbert , placed mit at the forefront in the investigation of interplanetary plasma .",
    "in parallel with his interest on plasmas in space , rossi had also become convinced of the importance of exploring the x - ray window of the universe . already on july 1958 , a few days after the first meeting of the space science board , he wrote to richard w. porter ( chairman of the technical panel for the earth satellite program , and member of the space science board ) , expressing the opinion that < < some exploratory work in the x - ray astronomy > > should be included in the satellite program for 19591960 .",
    "he suggested that < < the study of x - rays of the high - energy group be given first priority in the early phase of satellite experiments . in this regard",
    "he mentioned < < a balloon - experiment program directed toward a preliminary study of x - rays from extraterrestrial sources , > > and added that they < < would be interested in undertaking a satellite experiment for the study of x - rays in the 10@xmath45 ev region.>>-ray project , and on october 10 , 1958 , a proposal for the support of a high - energy @xmath0-ray satellite - borne experiment was submitted to the space science board by the cosmic - ray group of mit . ]    in 1959 the sun was the only known celestial source of x - rays .",
    "it is a comparatively weak source , which can be detected easily from the earth because of its proximity .",
    "for over ten years , solar x - rays had been extensively and successfully studied by scientists at the naval research laboratory under the leadership of herbert friedman .",
    "hard x - ray signals observed at lower altitudes softened as the rockets climbed through the atmosphere . a residual flux below 40 kev appeared to indicate a possible evidence of extrasolar x - rays .",
    "however , in the spring of 1960 , friedman had to admit that attempts to observe x - ray extrasolar sources in the night sky had been unsuccessful up to that moment : <",
    "< it may be that the interstellar medium is too opaque to x rays to permit the observation of very distant sources > > @xcite .",
    "rossi , who was chairman of the space project committee of the space science board ( `` analysis of advanced space research proposals and long - range planning '' ) , had been invited to participate to the work of john simpson s committee for physics of fields and particles in space , whose vice chairman was james van allen . in autumn 1959 , in a document with experiments proposed for 19591960 , simpson s committee recommended that < < a search should be made for continuous and burst x - radiation from the sun , the galaxy and from the earth .",
    "> > however , they were aware of the great technical difficulty of revealing x - rays emitted from extrasolar sources , whose fluxes might be so low that it could never be observed .",
    "evidence from ground - based radio astronomy had largely shown that a number of celestial objects were more abundantly emitting at radio wavelength , than in visible light .",
    "it seemed reasonable to expect the radio spectra to continue through the visible and ultraviolet , all the way to x - rays .",
    "on october 24 , 1958 , the interim report of simpson s committee had specifically mentioned the interest in studies in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray wavelengths .",
    "lawrence h. aller , a member of leo goldberg s committee on optical and radio astronomy , concluded a discussion on some aspects of ultraviolet satellite spectroscopy remarking how interstellar absorption would be strong up to the region of 20  , so that < < from distant stars and gaseous nebulae we can hope to observe only radiation in the x - ray region > > @xcite .",
    "leo goldberg pointed out the importance of x - ray astronomy as a new research tool , but emphasized as well the great technical difficulty of revealing x - rays emitted from extrasolar sources , whose fluxes might be so low that it could never be observed @xcite .    according to martin annis , rossi s old friend and his former student at mit , during a flight on the way home after a meeting of the science board , rossi had reflected on the concrete possibility of revealing x - rays of extrasolar origin : <",
    "< he was on the plane , sitting alone , and he thought that x - rays having the energy of some kev , before being absorbed can go through a certain thickness of air which can be compared to the mass absorption along galactic distances .",
    "the idea popped out in his mind .",
    "it was such a simple idea [  ] > > ]    soft x - rays extend from the low - energy cut - off due to interstellar absorption to about 15 kev .",
    "he was very excited and immediately talked with annis about the matter after his arrival : < < it just occurred to me that x - rays , specifically _ soft x - rays _ will penetrate the entire universe without absorption .",
    "we have never looked through the window of the soft x - ray region of the spectrum .",
    "i am convinced that exciting discoveries are to be made in this unknown world .",
    "> > ]    rossi s basic `` exploratory philosophy '' was as usual very simple : < < [  ] since space is transparent to x - rays , and since one can think of a number of ways in which x - rays can be generated in space and by stars , one should go and look and see what you find.>>. ] the very difficulty of detecting this type of radiation was clearly the kind of challenge that rossi had always pursued during his whole scientific life @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i was confident that , without resorting to any fundamentally new technology , it was possible to develop x - ray detectors substantially more sensitive than those previously used for solar observations . to be sure",

    "they were quite aware of the difficulties , as recalled by giacconi ( < < considering the sun to be a typical x - ray emitter , it became immediately obvious that the expected flux at earth from celestial sources would be below the threshold of current detector systems by many orders of magnitude .",

    "two parallel projects were developed : < < the first key suggestion by bruno was that we would have to develop an x - ray collection device to concentrate the flux.>>. ] giacconi studied the principles of x - ray optics developed by hans wolter in the late 1940s and suggested to use total external reflection of x - rays under grazing incidence as the basic principle of the new instrument .",
    "rossi suggested the refinement of nesting several mirror surfaces , thus increasing the effective collecting area and hence improve the detection rate @xcite .",
    "the first line of attack was thus the development of an x - ray telescope ( fig .",

    "but the group , which now included also the young herbert gursky , had not renounced the main target : `` soft x - rays from galactic sources . ''",
    "however , in order to make in parallel a x - ray survey of the sky , hoping to observe the predicted fluxes from extrasolar sources , it was necessary to construct an instrument easy to build , using more or less conventional detectors such as gm - counters and proportional counters , but far more sensitive and sophisticated than those used previously , although necessarily less sensitive than a telescope .    in this regard ,",
    "a short term project was in fact underway , as recalled by annis : < < a second key component of bruno s suggestions was that we would have to develop a large area detector with a very thin window for the detection of soft x - rays .",

    "this work , which extended over a period of about two years , was carried out to a great extent by frank r. paolini , who worked at as&e as an expert of electronics .",

    "as recalled in the introductory talk by robert davis , <",
    "< if we look for radiation from , say alpha centauri , which is very similar to the sun , we would find the received fluxes to be ten orders of magnitude smaller , even without considering interstellar absorption .",
    "> > however , it was clear that one could have good reason to believe that < < other types of objects are x - ray emitters , for example , the crab nebula , where strong emission occurs in both the visible light and radio regions [  ] it s fairly safe bet to presume that radiation extends into the x - ray region > > @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , davis remarked how aller s assumption @xcite that <",
    "< interstellar space begins to be transparent at 20  is perhaps a bit too optimistic ; perhaps it occurs at a somewhat lower wavelength [  ] > > in any case , the general discussion could not but examine more or less intense fluxes of x - rays produced by what at the time were considered standard processes taking place in stars and interstellar regions .",
    "the possibility that other astrophysical sources might emit copious fluxes of x - rays by production mechanisms which could not be foreseen was put forward by stan olbert , of the mit cosmic ray group , who had been requested by rossi to do some theoretical work on x - ray production by various stellar and interstellar processes : < < i believe that when we begin detecting and studying x rays from various astronomical sources , we will be in for a number of surprises .",
    "we may discover that the fluxes may be higher than we anticipate , coming from a number of different processes [  ] > > @xcite .    and indeed rossi s restlessness , which had always made him move from one problem to another always hoping to detect some yet unknown aspect of nature , was to be once more satisfied .",
    "after two failures a new rocket launching of the as&e payload took place at the white sands missile range , new mexico , on june 18 , 1962 , a day after full moon .",
    "the rocket payload carried an optical aspect sensor , a magnetometer and three of frank paolini s counters provided with windows of varying thickness so that the energy of the radiation could be detected .",
    "they were mounted symmetrically on the side of the rocket which rose to a maximum altitude of 225 km , while rotating at the rate of 2 revolutions per second around its spin axis . at each revolution",
    "the counters scanned a portion of the sky 100@xmath4 wide . throughout the flight the axis was pointing approximately in the vertical direction . at an altitude of 80 kilometers , the rocket having reached beyond the dense layers of the atmosphere , an increase in the pulse frequency of the counters signaled the appearance of a rather strong flux of radiation .",
    "the signal was strongly modulated by the rotation of the rocket , evidence that the x - rays did not come in equal numbers from all directions .",
    "the rocket remained above 80 kilometers for a total of 350 seconds .",
    "of the three counters , two worked reliably .    the dots in fig .",
    "[ sco - x1 ] show the total number of counts recorded during he entire flight .",
    "the higher curve is outlined by points representing data accumulated by counter 2 as a function of the azimuthal angle of the direction perpendicular to its plane .",
    "the lower curve was constructed with data obtained by the counter 3 provided with a thicker window ( about 1 millimeter ) , and therefore less sensitive to x - rays .",
    "the analysis of the records was not easy , as rossi recalled later , they spent weeks and weeks to make sure that there was nothing which might have misled them in the interpretation of their observation , and to convince themselves that the x - ray source was nt the moon actually : <",
    "< we were all skeptical at the beginning , and a lot of work was done to try to evaluate all possible sources of error.>>. ]    the investment of more than two years of hard work had returned only about 5 minutes of data , but the reward made all the effort worthwhile . at the end of summer they became sure that the data could < < best be explained by identifying the bulk of the radiation as soft x - rays from sources outside the solar system > > @xcite .    the experiment had also proved that the universe contains background radiation of x - ray light .",
    "the discovery of the first extra - solar x - ray source , was presented august 1962 in occasion of a congress at stanford university and was welcomed with enthusiasm , though mixed with considerable skepticism .",
    "it appeared incredible that a very simple instrument could have revealed such an intense signal as to appear incompatible with the available astronomic data _ regarding the celestial bodies then known_. it is worth noting that the article presenting those results was published by the _",
    "physical review _ only after rossi assumed personal responsibility for the assertions thereby contained @xcite .",
    "thirty years had elapsed since the young bruno rossi had to request the authority of werner heisenberg to have the plausibility of his early scientific results validated  . ]",
    "the experiment was repeated in exactly the same conditions in october 1962 , when the presumed source was below the horizon , and again in june 1963 , when the expected maximum reappeared in exactly the same position of one year earlier . in april 1963",
    "the source was located by c. stuart bowyer and herbert friedman in the constellation of scorpio @xcite , hence the name of scorpius x-1 by which it became known . which was ten times as sensitive as the detector of the as&e group .",
    "moreover , it was able to measure much more accurately the positions of possible sources .",
    "] they also detected x rays from the crab nebula @xcite    scorpius x-1 was some 9,000 light years away and apart from the sun , it revealed the most powerful x - ray source in earth s skies , an object emitting a thousand times more x rays than the sun at all wavelengths and a thousand times more energy in x rays than in visible light .",
    "an entire new astronomy was opening , an essential source of information about new classes of stellar objects , which since then has thrown light in previously unknown processes going on in the universe .",
    "as&e took the lead for many years in developing x - ray astronomy , a field which had a giant development also thanks to riccardo giacconi who was awarded the 2002 nobel prize for physics < < _ for pioneering contributions to astrophysics , which have led to the discovery of cosmic x - ray sources_. > >    his mentor bruno rossi , who was also deserving of that nobel prize , was no longer alive .",
    "rossi s intuition on the importance of exploiting new technological windows to look at the universe with new eyes is a fundamental key to understand the wide underlying theme which shaped the natural evolution of his scientific identity from a `` cosmic - ray physicist '' to a `` cosmic - ray astronomer '' .",
    "his scientific path is strongly interlaced with cosmic rays as a key to understand natural phenomena first at a microscopic level , and later at a cosmic scale .",
    "the new field of astroparticle physics , which emerged at the intersection of particle physics , astronomy and cosmology , is thus providing the proper perspective to look at rossi s scientific path .",
    "a profound unity characterizes the work of bruno rossi , guiding his research line up to the culminating moment of his scientific career at the beginning of 1960s when he and his group at mit demonstrated the existence of the solar wind and when he promoted the search for extra - solar sources of x rays , an idea which eventually led to the breakthrough experiment which marked the inception of cosmic x - ray astronomy , today one the main instruments to investigate astrophysical processes and the nature of the celestial bodies generating them .",
    "these achievements became the final acts of his coherent research project , begun on the hills of arcetri thirty years before :    this lifelong urge and the consciousness _ that the riches of nature far exceed the imagination of man _",
