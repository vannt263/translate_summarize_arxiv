    "coronal heating is one of the outstanding problems in solar physics .",
    "although the correlation of coronal activity with the intensity of photospheric magnetic fields seems beyond doubt , and there is large agreement that photospheric motions are the source of the energy flux that sustains an active region ( @xmath3 ) , the debate currently focuses on the physical mechanisms responsible for the transport , storage and dissipation ( i.e.  conversion to heat and/or particle acceleration ) of this energy from the photosphere to the corona .",
    "a promising model is that proposed by @xcite , who was the first to suggest that coronal heating could be the necessary outcome of an energy flux associated with the tangling of coronal field lines by photospheric motions .    over the years a number of numerical experiments have been carried out to investigate the parker problem , with particular emphasis on exploring how the shuffling of magnetic field line footpoints leads to current sheet formation , and to estimate the heating rate .",
    "3d cartesian simulations have been performed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a complex coronal magnetic field results from the photospheric field line random walk , and though the field does not , strictly speaking , evolve through a sequence of static force - free equilibrium states ( the original parker hypothesis ) , magnetic energy nonetheless tends to dominate kinetic energy in the system . in this limit the field is structured by current sheets elongated along the axial direction .",
    "the results from these studies agreed qualitatively among themselves , in that all simulations display the development of field aligned current sheets .",
    "however , estimates of the dissipated power and its scaling characteristics differed largely , depending on the way in which extrapolations from low to large values of the plasma conductivity of the properties such as inertial range power law indices were carried out .    the low resolution of the previous 3d studies has been partially overcome by 2d numerical simulations of incompressible mhd with magnetic forcing ( @xcite ) , which showed that turbulent current sheets dissipation is distributed intermittently , and that the statistics of dissipation events , in terms of total energy , peak energy and event duration displays power laws not unlike the distribution of observed emission events in optical , ultraviolet and x - ray wavelengths of the quiet solar corona .",
    "more recently a first attempt to simulate full 3d sections of the solar corona with a realistic geometry has been performed by @xcite . at the moment the very low resolution attainable with this kind of simulations does not allow the development of turbulence .",
    "the transfer of energy from the scale of convection cells @xmath4 toward smaller scales is in fact inhibited , because the smaller scales are not resolved ( their linear resolution is in fact @xmath5 ) .    while in the future",
    "these global simulations will be able to reach the necessary high resolutions , to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the parker scenario at relatively high reynolds numbers , we have recently performed high - resolution long - time simulation of the aforementioned cartesian model ( @xcite ) .    in the next sections we describe the coronal loop model , the simulations we have carried out , and give simple scaling arguments to understand the energy spectral slopes .",
    "a coronal loop is a closed magnetic structure threaded by a strong axial field , with the footpoints rooted in the photosphere .",
    "this makes it a strongly anisotropic system , as measured by the relative magnitude of the alfvn velocity associated with the axial magnetic field @xmath6 compared to the typical photospheric velocity @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the relative amplitude of the alfvn waves that are launched into the corona is very small and , as an efficient energy cascade takes place @xcite , the relative amplitude of the fields which develop in the orthogonal planes remains small compared to the dominant axial magnetic field .",
    "we study the loop dynamics in a simplified cartesian geometry , neglecting any curvature effect , as a `` straightened out '' box , with an orthogonal square cross section of size @xmath8 ( along which the x - y directions lie ) , and an axial length @xmath9 ( along the z direction ) embedded in an axial homogeneous uniform magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "this simplified geometry allows us to perform simulations with both high numerical resolution and long - time duration .",
    "the dynamics of a plasma embedded in a strong axial magnetic field are well described by the equations of reduced mhd ( @xcite ) . in this limit",
    "the velocity and magnetic fields have only perpendicular components , linked to the velocity and magnetic potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath13 although numerically we advance the equations for the potentials ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to analyze the linear and nonlinear properties of the system it is convenient to write the equivalent equations using the elssser variables @xmath14 .",
    "the more symmetric equations , which explicit the underlying physical processes at work , are given in dimensionless form by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total pressure , and is linked to the nonlinear terms by incompressibility  ( [ eq : els3 ] ) : @xmath17    the gradient operator has only components in the @xmath18-@xmath19 plane perpendicular to the axial direction @xmath20 , and the dynamics in the orthogonal planes is coupled to the axial direction through the linear terms @xmath21 .",
    "we use a computational box with an aspect ratio of 10 , which then spans @xmath22    the linear terms @xmath21 are multiplied by the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 , the ratio between the alfvn velocity associated with the axial magnetic field @xmath24 , and the photosperic velocity @xmath25 .",
    "boundary conditions for our numerical simulations are specified imposing the velocity potential @xmath26 in the bottom ( @xmath27 ) and top ( @xmath28 ) planes : @xmath29.\\ ] ] these result from the linear combination of large - scale eddies with random amplitudes @xmath30 and phases @xmath31 ( whose values are included between 0 and 1 ) .",
    "we excite all the twelve independent modes whose wave - numbers are included in the range @xmath32 , and then normalize the result so that the velocity rms is @xmath33 .    in terms of the elssser variables",
    "@xmath34 , to impose a velocity pattern ( @xmath35 ) at the boundary surfaces means to impose the constraint @xmath36 , and as in terms of characteristics ( which in this case are simply @xmath34 themselves ) we can specify only the incoming wave ( while the outgoing wave is determined by the dynamics inside the computational box ) , at the top ( @xmath28 ) and bottom ( @xmath27 ) planes the following `` reflection '' takes place : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the forcing functions in the respective boundary surfaces .    at time @xmath41",
    "no perturbation is imposed inside the computational box , i.e.  @xmath42 , and only the axial magnetic field @xmath0 is present : the subsequent dynamics are then the effect of the photospheric forcing on the system .",
    "the linear terms ( @xmath21 ) in equations  ( [ eq : els1])-([eq : els2 ] ) give rise to two distinct wave equations for the @xmath34 fields , which describe alfvn waves propagating along the axial direction @xmath20 .",
    "this wave propagation , which is present during both the linear and nonlinear stages , is responsible for the transport of energy at the large perpendicular scales from the boundaries ( photosphere ) into the loop .",
    "the nonlinear terms @xmath43 are then responsible for the transport of this energy from the large scales toward the small scales , where energy is finally dissipated , i.e.  converted to heat and/or particle acceleration .",
    "an important feature of the nonlinear terms in equations  ( [ eq : els1])-([eq : els3 ] ) is the absence of self - coupling , i.e.  they only couple counterpropagating waves , and if one of the two fields @xmath34 were zero , there would be no nonlinear dynamics at all .",
    "this is at the basis of the so - called alfvn effect ( @xcite ) , that ultimately renders the nonlinear timescales longer and slows down the dynamics .    from this analysis",
    "it is clear that three different timescales are present : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the crossing time of the alfvn waves along the axial direction @xmath20 , i.e.the time it takes for an alfvn wave to cover the loop length @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath48 is the characteristic time associated with photospheric motions , while @xmath46 is the nonlinear timescale .    for a typical coronal loop @xmath49 , and for this reason we consider a forcing which is constant in time , i.e.   for which formally @xmath50 .    in the rmhd ordering the nonlinear timescale @xmath46 is bigger than the alfvn crossing time @xmath44",
    "this ordering is confirmed and maintained troughout our numerical simulations .",
    "the length of a coronal section is taken as the unitary length , but as we excite all the wavenumbers between 3 and 4 , and the typical convection cell scale is @xmath4 , this implies that each side of our section is roughly @xmath51 long .",
    "our grid for the cross - sections has 512x512 grid points , corresponding to @xmath52 points per convective cell , and hence a linear resolution of @xmath53 .    between the top and bottom plate a uniform magnetic field @xmath54",
    "is present .",
    "the subsequent evolution is due to the shuffling of the footpoints of the magnetic field lines by the photospheric forcing .    in this section we present the results of a simulation performed with a numerical grid with 512x512x200 points , hyper - diffusion ( @xmath55 ) with @xmath56 , and the alfvn velocity @xmath57 corresponding to a ratio @xmath58 .",

    "this is the natural result of the field line bending due to the photospheric motions both in the linear and nonlinear stages .",
    "more formally this is a consequence of the fact that , while on the perpendicular magnetic field no boundary condition is imposed , the velocity field must approach the imposed boundary values at the photosphere both during the linear and nonlinear stages .    after this time , in the fully nonlinear stage , a _ statistically steady state _ is reached , in which the poynting flux , i.e.  the energy that is entering the system for unitary time , balances on time average the total dissipation rate ( @xmath70 ) . as a result there is no average accumulation of energy in the box , beyond what has been accumulated during the linear stage , and a detailed examination of the dissipation time series ( see inset in figure  [ fig : endiss ] ) shows that the poynting flux and total dissipations are decorrelated around dissipation peaks .    .",

    "recently a lot of progress has been made in the understanding of turbulence for an mhd system embedded in a strong magnetic field ( @xcite ) . as a coronal loop",
    "is threaded by a strong magnetic field , it is no surprise that the nonlinear dynamics is described by weak mhd turbulence .",
    "the spectra that we have found can be easily derived by order of magnitude considerations .",
    "a characteristic of anisotropic mhd turbulence is that the cascade takes place mainly in the plane orthogonal to the dc magnetic guide field ( @xcite ) .",
    "dimensionally , and integrating over the whole box , the energy cascade rate may be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the rms value of the elssser fields @xmath14 at the perpendicular scale @xmath81 .",

    "more generally , however , as the alfvn speed is increased nonlinear interactions become weaker .",
    "simply from dimensional considerations as the ratio @xmath87 is dimensionless and smaller than 1 , we can suppose that the energy transfer time scales as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the scaling index ( note that @xmath90 corresponds to standard hydrodynamic turbulence ) .",

    "considering that this integral is dominated by energy at the large scales , due to the characteristics of the forcing function , we can approximate it with @xmath95 where the large scale component of the magnetic field can be replaced with @xmath96 because the system is magnetically dominated .",
    "the last two equations show that the system is self - organized because both @xmath97 and @xmath98 depend on @xmath96 , the rms values of the fields @xmath34 at the scale @xmath99 : the internal dynamics depends on the injection of energy and the injection of energy itself depends on the internal dynamics via the boundary forcing .    in a stationary cascade the injection rate ( [ eq : pf ] ) is equal to the transport rate ( [ eq : sbe2 ] ) . equating the two yields for the amplitude at the scale @xmath99 : @xmath100 substituting this value in ( [ eq : sbe2 ] ) or ( [ eq : pf ] ) we obtain for the energy flux @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
