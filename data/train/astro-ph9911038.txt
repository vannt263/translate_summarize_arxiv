    "the total number of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is estimated by different methods , and it is generally accepted to be about 3001000 detectable snrs in the galaxy .",
    "green s ( @xcite ) catalog includes 220 confirmed snrs and several dozens of possible or probable ones .",
    "most of them are radio snrs .",
    "thus a search for new snrs is an important task of observational radio astronomy .",
    "such searches have been made by whiteoak & green ( @xcite ) , gray ( @xcite ) , duncan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . using the radio morphology ,",
    "weiler ( @xcite ) divided the galactic snrs on three classes of shell - like , crab - like or plerionic and mixed or composite ones .",
    "as a rule , in these searches the shell or composite snrs have been found , and the shells dominate the total sample .",
    "trushkin ( @xcite ) searched for new snrs in the galactic plane survey with the ratan-600 radio telescope in the first and fourth galactic quadrants between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 at 0.96 , 3.9 and 11.2 ghz .",
    "a dozen extended non - thermal sources which could be new snrs have been revealed . a analysis of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) maps ( condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) is extremely helpful for such a search in the galactic plane . in spite of the apparent insensitivity of nvss to extended radiation , nearly 80 known galactic snrs are visible in nvss maps .",
    "trushkin ( @xcite ) created the collection of the snr images that is released via the world wide web .",
    "this induces us to search for new shell snrs in the original @xmath14 nvss maps . excluding known hii regions or planetary nebulae , we have selected nearly 20 shell snr candidates .",
    "one of them , g16.2@xmath02.7 , shows all the necessary properties to recognize it as a new snr .    .",
    "in fig.[map ] the nvss - map of g16.2@xmath02.7 at 1.4 ghz is shown . here",
    "the maps are plotted with the `` skyview '' package ( ebert et al .",
    "the circular shell structure of the snr has the angular diameter @xmath15 , while the integral flux density in the map , s@xmath16 jy , is much lower than the value extrapolated from the spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "the large uncertainty of the nvss flux depends strongly on the background level definition and could only be a lower limit because the nvss suffers from lack of zero - spacing data and its images are insensitive to smooth radio structures much larger than several arcmin .",
    "the flux weighted centroid of the source has the galactic coordinates : @xmath17=16167 and @xmath18689 or equatorial ones : radec1950 = @xmath19 , @xmath0160950 .",
    "recently gaensler ( @xcite ) has investigated the nature of the the bilateral snrs , one of them , g03.8 - 0.3 , has a bilateral structure very similar with g16.2@xmath02.7 .",
    "their surface brightness , angular sizes are close .",
    "we could estimate the value of @xmath20 defined to be the acute angle between the symmetry axis of the snr and the galactic plane .",
    "we fit the symmetry axis using only the bright circular arcs .",
    "this gives a value @xmath21 .",
    "thus the symmetry axis is aligned close to the galactic plane ( see fig.[map ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the central weak filament with a brightness of nearly 1.5 mjy / beam ( @xmath22 ) located close to the symmetry axis is real and associated with this snr or not .",
