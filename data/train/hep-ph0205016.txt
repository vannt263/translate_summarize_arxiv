    "the nature and quark substructure of low mass scalar mesons , in particular those of isoscalar @xmath5 and isovector @xmath6 , have been a subject of controversy in hadron spectroscopy over the years .",
    "a variety of interpretations have been proposed for their structure , but , whether they are conventional @xmath7 states in quark model @xcite , @xmath8 molecules @xcite , or exotic multiquark @xmath9 states @xcite have not been established yet .",
    "it was suggested by achasov and ivanchenko @xcite that the radiative decays of @xmath10 meson to pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , offer the possibility of obtaining information on the nature of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , respectively .",
    "close , isgur and kumano @xcite noted that the radiative decays @xmath13 , where @xmath14 or @xmath2 , can be utilized to differentiate among various models of the structure of these scalar mesons .",
    "they shown that although the transition rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 depends on the unknown dynamics , the ratio of the decay rates @xmath17 will be sensitive to the spatial distribution of quarks and the spatial wavefunctions of scalar mesons , and thus it provides an experimental test which distinguishes between alternative explanations of their structure . in both the @xmath8 molecule , and four - quark cluster @xmath9 pictures of the structure of scalar mesons ,",
    "it is now generally accepted that the radiative decays @xmath18 proceed by the mechanism in which @xmath10 and @xmath19 both couple to an intermediate @xmath20 loop in the chain of reactions @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay rates were obtained as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a form factor that depends on the spatial wavefunctions of the scalar mesons , and @xmath24 in point - like effective field theory calculations . in obtaining this result",
    "it is further assumed that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are isospin eigenstates , and @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are spatially extended @xmath8 molecules with @xmath26 , then @xmath27 and the resulting branching ratios are br(@xmath28 @xcite . if the meson states are compact four - quark clusters confined within @xmath29 like in @xmath9 picture , then the resulting branching ratios are expected as br(@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the predictions about the absolute branching ratios of @xmath13 decays , there is also the weaker result that follows from eq .",
    "1 , that is theoretically @xmath31 .",
    "the very accurate data that have been obtained from novosibirsk snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite collaborations give the following branching ratios for @xmath11 and @xmath0 decays : br(@xmath32 @xcite , br(@xmath33 @xcite , and br(@xmath34 , br(@xmath35 @xcite , where the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic . from the analysis of their experimental results ,",
    "achasov et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the @xmath36 mechanism dominates the @xmath37 decay and the contributions coming from @xmath38 and @xmath39 intermediate states are small .",
    "neglecting these contributions they obtained the branching ratio br(@xmath40 , where the second errors are systematic and includes uncertainty in the interference terms .",
    "this branching ratio was also obtained by akhmetshin et al . from their data of @xmath37 decay as br(@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 decay branching ratio is now quoted as an average of these two results which is br(@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "achasov et al . , on the other hand , by assuming that @xmath44 intermediate state dominates the @xmath0 decay , and the contributions from other decay mechanisms , for example @xmath45 , @xmath46 , can be neglected , obtained the value for the branching ratio of the decay @xmath47 as br(@xmath48 from the data of their @xmath0 decay experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore , these experimental results suggest for the ratio of the decay rates of the decays @xmath49 and @xmath47 the experimental value @xmath50 , with which the theoretical result @xmath51 is not in agreement .    in this paper",
    ", we study the role of the scalar @xmath6 meson in the mechanism of the radiative @xmath0 decay employing a phenomenological framework , in which we try to assess the roles of different processes and the contributions to the decay rate coming from their amplitude in the mechanism of this decay , and this way we attempt to estimate the branching ratio br(@xmath52 of the decay @xmath47 from the experimental data of the radiative @xmath0 decay . in our analysis",
    ", we use the experimental data of novosibirsk snd collaboration @xcite .",
    "the radiative decay process of the type @xmath53 where v and p belong to the lowest multiplets of vector ( v ) and pseudoscalar ( p ) mesons have been studied using different approaches . in particular , the branching ratio @xmath54 has been calculated as @xmath55 @xcite by considering intermediate vector meson contribution only , and as @xmath56 @xcite by using chiral loop model within the framework of chiral phenomenological lagrangians .    in order to include the scalar @xmath2 meson resonance pole in the decay mechanism for the calculation of the decay rate of @xmath0 decay in a phenomenological framework we consider two different approaches . in both approaches",
    ", we do not make any assumptions about the structure of the scalar @xmath2 meson .    in the first approach , which we name model i",
    ", we include the scalar @xmath2 resonance in an ad hoc manner . in this approach",
    ", we assume that the mechanism of the @xmath0 decay consists of the reactions shown by the diagrams in fig .",

    "the decay rates for the @xmath4 and the @xmath64 decays resulting from the above lagrangians are @xmath65 and @xmath66 \\left[1-\\frac{(m_{\\pi^0}-m_\\eta)^2}{m_{a_0}^2}\\right]}~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",

    "1(b ) by the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath81 which results from the standard chiral lagrangians in the lowest order of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "1(c ) may be considered not to be very realistic since this diagram implies direct quark transition and it thus makes a very small contribution because of ozi supression .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the scalar resonances @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be excited from the chiral loops , with the loop iteration provided by the bethe - salpeter equation using a kernel from the lowest order chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the experimental data obtained in novosibirsk give resonable arguments in favour of the one - loop mechanism for @xmath101 and @xmath102 decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our second approach to study the radiative @xmath0 decay , which we name model ii , we assume that this decay proceeds through the reactions @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 where the last reaction proceeds by a two - step mechanisms with @xmath2 coupling to @xmath10 with intermediate @xmath8 states .",
    "we show the processes contributing to the @xmath106 decay amplitude diagramatically in fig .",

    "however , since the mass of the @xmath116 meson is very close to the @xmath20 threshold , this induces a strong energy dependence in the width of the @xmath2-meson .",
    "we follow the widely accepted option to deal with this problem that was proposed by flatt@xmath117 @xcite based on a coupled channel @xmath118 description of the @xmath2 resonance , and parametrize the @xmath2 width as @xmath119 where @xmath120[q^2-(m_{\\pi^0}-m_\\eta)^2]}~~.\\ ] ] we use the flatt@xmath117 parameter @xmath121 as @xmath122 which was determined by e852 collaboration at bnl by a fit to data in their experiment in which they determined the parameters of the @xmath2 meson @xcite . in all our calculations and in the analysis of the experimental invariant @xmath3 mass spectrum of the @xmath106 decay , therefore , for the mass of @xmath2 meson we use the value @xmath123 gev as determined in this experiment by e852 collaboration @xcite .",

    "1 , as well as the contribution of the total amplitude which includes the interference term as well . our model gives a reasonable prediction for the spectrum over most of the range of the invariant mass @xmath91 except in its higher part where the expected enhancement due to the contribution of @xmath2 resonance is not produced .",
    "the distribution @xmath147 we obtain for the other root , that is for @xmath146 , is even poorer which we do not show .",
    "we obtain the branching ratio for the decay @xmath148 using for the coupling constant @xmath149 as @xmath150 .",
    "however , because of the fact that model i does not produce a satisfactory description of the experimental invariant @xmath91 mass spectrum for the decay @xmath0 , we can not consider the value of the coupling constant @xmath145 and the resulting branching ratio @xmath150 too seriously . in this connection , we like to note that the coupling constant @xmath144 has been calculated @xcite employing qcd sum rules and utilizing @xmath151-mixing by studying the three point @xmath57-correlation function as @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , the photoproduction cross section of @xmath113 mesons on photon targets near threshold has been shown @xcite to be mainly given by @xmath153-exchange , and assuming vector meson dominance of the electromagnetic current the value of the coupling constant @xmath154 was deduced . in the study of the structure of the @xmath10 meson photoproduction amplitude on nucleons near threshold based on the one - meson exchange and pomeron - exchange mechanism @xcite ,",
    "this value of the coupling constant @xmath155 was used to calculate the coupling constant @xmath61 by invoking unitary symmetry arguments as @xmath156 by assuming that @xmath153 , @xmath157 , and @xmath2 are numbers of a unitary nonet , which is not without problems . in the light of our discussion of model i and the resulting poor invariant mass spectrum of the decay @xmath0",
    ", it may be argued that all these values for the coupling constant @xmath144 should be considered with some caution .",
    "we follow the same procedure in model ii , and obtain the coupling constant @xmath142 as @xmath158 gev and @xmath159 gev utilizing the experimental value of the @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "we then plot the resulting invariant mass distribution for the decay @xmath0 and compare it with the experimental result @xcite . in fig . 4 and in fig .",
    "5 we plot the distribution @xmath147 for the radiative decay @xmath0 in our phenomenological approach choosing coupling constant @xmath160 gev and @xmath161 gev , respectively , as a function of the invariant mass @xmath91 of the @xmath3 system . in these figures , as before , we also indicate the contributions coming from the different reactions @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 in model ii shown diagramatically in fig .",

    "we note that for @xmath160 gev our prediction for the invariant mass spectrum is in good agreement with the experimental result and not only the overall shape and feature but also the enhancement due to the contribution of the @xmath2 resonance is well produced .",
    "therefore , from the analysis of the spectrum obtained with the coupling constants @xmath160 gev and @xmath165 gev in fig . 4 and 5 , respectively , we may decide in favour of the value @xmath166 gev , and we may state that the experimental data within the framework of our phenomenological approach in model ii , suggest for the coupling constant @xmath110 the value @xmath167 gev .",
    "furthermore , we note that model ii provides a better way as compared to model i in order to incorporate the @xmath2 meson into the mechanism of the @xmath0 decay , and thus our result gives further support for the approach in which @xmath2 meson state arises as a dynamical state and for the two - step mechanism for its coupling to @xmath10 meson with intermediate @xmath8 states . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied the radiative @xmath37 decay also within the framework of a phenomenological approach in which we considered the contributions of @xmath153 meson , @xmath1 meson and @xmath5 meson .",
    "we analyzed the interference effects between different contributions using the experimental results of snd collaboration . in that analysis ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath168 appeared with positive sign , that is @xmath169 . in the present analysis",
    ", we obtained the coupling constant @xmath110 as @xmath170 .",
    "we like to note that this result about the relative phase between @xmath168 and @xmath110 is consistent with the result obtained in the @xmath9 model where @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the decay rate @xmath16 by assuming the two - step one - loop mechanism @xmath172 for the decay @xmath4 .",
    "we show this mechanism diagramatically in fig .",
    "the decay rate that follows from these diagrams is given by @xmath173 where @xmath96 , @xmath174 , and the loop function i(a , b ) is defined in eq .",
    "we use the coupling constant @xmath175 gev and then obtain the decay rate for @xmath176 decay as @xmath177 kev and the branching ratio as @xmath178 .",
    "this result when combined with the experimental value @xmath179 gives the ratio @xmath180 , which is still larger than the theoretical value of 1.the value @xmath181 we obtain for the branching ratio of the decay @xmath148 , although not in disagreement , is somewhat larger than the result of achasov et al .",
    "which is @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we obtain a smaller value for the experimental ratio @xmath183 than the previous result which is @xmath184 .",
    "we like to note , however , that achasov et al @xcite assumed that @xmath44 intermediate state dominates the @xmath185 decay and they neglected the contributions coming from other intermediate states in their analysis .",
    "on the other hand , in our analysis we include the contributions coming not only from @xmath44 intermediate state but also from @xmath39 and @xmath20 intermediate states as well as from their interference .    in order to obtain the branching ratio for @xmath148 decay utilizing the experimental value of the decay rate and the experimental invariant @xmath3 mass spectrum for the @xmath0 decay , we use a phenomenological approach . in our analysis , we employ point - like effective field theory and we deduce from the experimental data the coupling constant of point - like @xmath2 meson coupled to point - like k meson .",
    "the coupling constant that we obtain @xmath186 gev results in the branching ratio @xmath181 for @xmath4 decay using one loop @xmath187 mechanism .",
    "we can , therefore , suggest that the branching ratio for the decay @xmath148 that is used in the literature should be revised as @xmath188 .",
    "we can also assert that our analysis suggests a lower value @xmath189 for the ratio @xmath17 than used previously .    in a very recent paper @xcite",
    "the kloe collaboration presented the result of their experimental study of @xmath0 decay . in their analysis , they conclude that @xmath0 decay is dominated by the process @xmath4 and from a fit to @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum they find the branching ratio @xmath190 for the @xmath4 decay . in view of this finding",
    ", our result @xmath191 implies that @xmath192 .",
    "this value supports the view that the structure of @xmath2 meson is a combination of a @xmath8 molecule with a compact @xmath9 core @xcite .",
