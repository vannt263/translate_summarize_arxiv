    "( usually , this probability is obtained from an asymptotic form of the error function . )",

    "in this section , we will quickly review some basic aspects of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which are covered in most introductory physics texts .",
    "the key assumption is a collection of free classical particles in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the general form of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution states that the probability of finding a particle with energy @xmath1 is proportional to the boltzmann factor , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "if @xmath4 , the kinetic energy of a particle on mass @xmath5 and speed @xmath6 , then the normalized probability distribution becomes @xmath7 in most textbooks , the boltzmann factor and hence the distribution are derived using the canonical ensemble , see refs .   for alternative approaches .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mb ] ) is the probability distribution for the speed of a single particle , so @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the probability for the particle to have a speed in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath11 occurs at the most probable speed , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the root - mean - squared speed , defined by @xmath14 , is @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 for a nitrogen molecule at room temperature , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so we can write @xmath19    it is convenient to express the probability distribution in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath20 , and write @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the distribution , @xmath23 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mb ] .    , where @xmath24 is the most probable speed .",
    "]    it is worth trying to understand intuitively why @xmath23 has a maximum , and falls to zero for both high speeds and low speeds . the high speed tail , on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : mb ] is the easier to understand . in thermal equilibrium , with a range in possible particle speeds",
    ", there will always be a few particles with speeds above the average .",
    "however , the @xmath25 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) strongly suppresses the probability for the speed to be many times larger than @xmath24 .",
    "this arises because very fast particles will quickly collide with other particles , and typically lose energy in the collision .",
    "the low speed end of the distribution , where @xmath26 is often ascribed in advanced texts to  small phase space volume \" . however , this is really a way of saying that it is very unlikely for a particle to sit nearly at rest for a long time when surrounded by other rapidly moving particles",
    ". the slow particle will be be hit by faster particle and will typically gain kinetic energy in the collision .",
    "there are some useful quantities which can be estimated from the parameters of the gas .",
    "one of these is the mean free path , which is approximately @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the particle number density and @xmath29 is the collision cross section .",
    "there is an average spatial volume of @xmath30 for each particle , and a collision becomes likely after the particle has swept out a volume of @xmath31 .",
    "the typical time between collision is then @xmath32 .",
    "a second useful quantity is the flux of particles striking a surface .",
    "if all particles were moving in the @xmath33-direction , taken to be normal to the surface , with speed @xmath34 , then this flux would be @xmath35 . in the gas in thermal equilibrium",
    ", we must have @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a numerical constant somewhat less than one .",
    "an estimate which imagines that one - third of the particles are moving along each of the three space directions , and of those moving along the @xmath38-axis , one - half are moving in the @xmath33-direction , leads to @xmath39 , an exact calculation leads to @xmath40 .",
    "see ref   for the details .",
    "here we will explore some aspects of the low velocity end of the probability distribution , the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : mb ] , where @xmath41 .",
    "first , define a cummulative probability by @xmath42 which is the probability of finding that a particle has @xmath43 , and hence a speed less than @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 , and hence @xmath41 , the probability distribution is approximately @xmath46 consequently , @xmath47    as discussed in the previous section , the small value of @xmath48 for small @xmath49 reflects the improbability that a particle can be nearly at rest at finite temperature .",
    "this can be made more explicit with some examples .",
    "the expected speed of the slowest nitrogen molecule in a box at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a volume of one cubic meter containing about @xmath50 molecules , corresponds to @xmath51 , leading to the estimate @xmath52 .      here",
    "we explore the limits of a classical description of an ideal gas .",
    "this description fails due to quantum effects when the debroglie wavelength , @xmath53 of the majority of the particles becomes comparable to the average separation , @xmath54 , of the particles . here",
    "@xmath55 is planck s constant .",
    "this result arises from detailed calculations in quantum statistical mechanics , but can be understood intuitively as follows : the classical limit of quantum mechanics occurs when the particles can be described by localized wavepackets , whose size is small compared to other length scales . in the case of an ideal gas ,",
    "this other scale is @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , the size of a wavepacket is always larger than @xmath56 , so the classical limit is only possible if @xmath57 .    the ideal gas law",
    ", @xmath58 leads to an expression for @xmath54 , @xmath59 this can also be written as @xmath60 we can estimate the typical debroglie wavelength of the particles in a gas by setting @xmath61 , and writing @xmath62 this can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass of a helium atom .",
    "the fractional quantum corrections to the classical equation of state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ideal ] ) are of order  @xcite @xmath65 , and hence are about @xmath66 for helium at room temperature and atmospheric pressure , and smaller for heavier molecules , so the classical ideal gas description is very good .    however , eq .  ( [ eq : low - v ] )",
    "predicts that there will always be some probability for a particle to be  quantum \" in the sense that @xmath67 .",
    "we can estimate this probability by letting @xmath68 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda - vp ] ) .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the probability that @xmath67 of @xmath69 note that this result is likely to be an underestimate at low temperatures , as helium becomes a superfluid at @xmath70 .",
    "however by this temperature , a description based on the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb ] ) , needs to be replaced by one based on bose - einstein statistics .",
    "when the fraction of quantum particles is small , there is no known effect which they produce , apart from a small correction to the equation of state .",
    "however , we will see in sect .",
    "[ sec : escape ] , that sometimes a small fraction of molecules can have important effects .",
    "let us begin by defining an analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumm ] ) for the upper end of the probability distribution : @xmath71 this is the probability of finding @xmath72 , that is , finding a particle with a speed @xmath73 .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumm - h ] ) can not be performed in terms of elementary functions , but it does have a simple form when @xmath74 .",
    "this form can be derived analytically from the asymptotic form of the error function , but here we give a heuristic derivation .",
    ", for @xmath75 is illustrated .",
    "the rectangle of height @xmath76 and width @xmath77 is chosen so that its area , @xmath78 , is equal to the area of the tail , @xmath79 . ]",
    "the basic idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tail ] .",
    "the width @xmath77 of the rectangle is selected so that the rectangle s area is equal to that under the tail , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumm - h ] ) .",
    "the trick is to guess a form for @xmath77 and then confirm it by a numerical experiment .",
    "first , we guess that @xmath77 should decrease with increasing @xmath49 . given that , the simplest form is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an undetermined constant .",
    "the numerical experiment consists of numerical integration of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumm - h ] ) for various values of @xmath49 , and comparison with @xmath82 the result is that @xmath83 gives good agreement ( within the 1 % level ) between the two forms for @xmath84 .",
    "this confirms our guess for the form of @xmath77 .",
    "this leads to the asymptotic form for @xmath74 , @xmath85 in fact , @xmath49 does not need to be very large before eq .",
    "( [ eq : high - v ] ) gives a reasonable estimate .",
    "even for @xmath86 , it agrees with the exact result to about 10 % .",
    "it is of interest to note that the @xmath87 factor causes @xmath88 to fall extremely rapidly with increasing @xmath49 .",
    "for example , @xmath89 , meaning that fewer than one in @xmath90 of the particles has a speed @xmath91 , or @xmath92 . nonetheless , this small fraction of particles can have important effects .",
    "it is important to remember that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution applies to a gas in thermal equilibrium . in the earth",
    "s atmosphere there can be effects , such as collisions with cosmic rays , which could produce more high speed molecules than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : high - v ] ) .",
    "if this happens , there is a departure from equilibrium , so the maxwell - boltzmann distribution is no longer exactly valid .",
    "one consequence of the high velocity tail of the distribution can be the escape of gas molecules from the gravitational field of a planet or moon .",
    "if a molecule has a speed greater than the escape velocity , and can avoid colliding with other molecules , then it can escape into interplanetary space .",
    "this form of escape was first treated by james jeans  @xcite , and is known as ",
    "jeans escape \" .",
    "the details can be quite complicated and are discussed in refs .",
    ", for example .",
    "in addition , there can be several other escape mechanisms , such as effects of the solar wind .",
    "here we give a very brief and simplified version .",
    "the escape velocity from a distance @xmath93 from the center of a planet of mass @xmath94 is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is newton s constant . for the case of the earth , @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath98 , so eq .  ( [ eq : vp ] ) leads to @xmath99^\\frac{1}{2 } \\ , , \\label{eq : x0}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the mass and radius of the earth , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : high - v ] ) leads to @xmath102 so there are no nitrogen or oxygen molecules near the earth s surface moving faster than the escape velocity .",
    "furthermore , a molecule with @xmath103 has a reasonable chance to actually escape only if its mean free path is as large as the distance it needs to travel to leave the planet s atmosphere .",
    "this condition defines the location of the base of the planet s exosphere . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfp ] ) , we see that the mean free path @xmath104 increases as the number density @xmath28 decreases .",
    "if we assume that @xmath28 obeys a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , a reasonable guess for the form of @xmath105 is @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the distance from the surface of the planet , ( so @xmath108 on the surface ) , and @xmath109 is the gravitational potential energy of a molecule as a function of @xmath107 . if @xmath107 is small compared to the planet s radius , we can set @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the gravitational acceleration at the surface . in general ,",
    "the temperature @xmath0 is also a function of @xmath107 .",
    "we can combine eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mfp ] ) and ( [ eq : rho ] ) to obtain @xmath113 , the dependence of the mean free path upon @xmath107 .",
    "we can define the height of the base of the exosphere by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 this definition is motivated by the notion that once a molecule reaches @xmath116 moving outward , it has a very good chance to actually escape . by the time it reaches @xmath117 ,",
    "the mean free path @xmath113 will have increased significantly , so the chances of scattering are still small .",
    "an estimate of flux of escaping particles is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) , but with @xmath118 replaced by @xmath119 , so @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the number density of molecules at the base of the exosphere with @xmath103 .",
    "a more precise value could be obtained by an integration over all @xmath103 , but @xmath11 is falling so rapidly with increasing @xmath6 that this is unnecessary for an approximate treatment .",
    "the total number of molecules of a given type is given by @xmath122 where @xmath105 is the number density of that molecule .",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath123 due to jean s escape is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the area of the base of the exosphere .",
    "the characteristic time for a significant fraction of this type of molecule to escape is @xmath126    here we make a rough estimate of @xmath123 in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath112 .",
    "let the characteristic height of the atmosphere , below which a majority of the molecules are located , be @xmath128 , defined by @xmath129 . if @xmath130 , then we can write @xmath131 for air molecules at about @xmath132 , this leads to @xmath133 , which is a reasonable estimate for the earth .",
    "note that typically @xmath134 .",
    "we can approximate the planet s atmosphere as a thin shell of area @xmath135 and thickness @xmath128 , and write @xmath136 if @xmath137 , so the area from which molecules escape is also about @xmath135 , we can combine our estimate of @xmath123 with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux - esc ] ) , ( [ eq : dotn ] ) , and ( [ eq : tesc ] ) to give an estimate of the escape time : @xmath138 here we ignore numerical factors of order one , such as @xmath139",
    ". the factor of @xmath140 represents the time required for a molecule to traverse the lower atmosphere at the escape velocity if there were no scattering , this time is about 1  second in the case of the earth .",
    "the other two factors are large dimensionless numbers .",
    "the very low density of molecules at the base of the exosphere compared to the surface of the planet , leads to the factor of @xmath141 , and the final factor describes the effect of the fraction of molecules with speeds above the escape velocity .",
    "the height of the base earth s exosphere can vary , and depends upon conditions such as solar activity , but is typically a few hundred kilometers .",
    "similarly , the temperature there can also vary , approximately in the range @xmath142 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "2.7 in ref .. ) for a rough approximation , let us assume that @xmath143 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) if @xmath0 is approximately constant .",
    "now all we need to estimate @xmath144 is the ratio @xmath145 and the value of @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0 ] ) .",
    "for example , let @xmath146 and assume that the temperature in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0 ] ) is @xmath147 . for the case of nitrogen molecules",
    ", this leads to @xmath148 , and @xmath149 the resulting escape time is @xmath150 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for hydrogen molecules are @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "this enormous difference in escape time comes from the lighter mass of @xmath154 leading to a smaller value of @xmath49 , and hence a much greater probability of being above the escape velocity .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the earth , at an age of about @xmath155 , having nitrogen , but not hydrogen , persisting in its atmosphere from the time of the earth s formation .",
    "brownian motion , discovered by the botanist robert brown in 1827 , is the random motion of small particles suspended in a fluid , such as water .",
    "we now understand this motion as arising from collisions of the fluid molecules with the particle .",
    "this effect can easily be observed in a diluted homogenized milk in a microscope with a magnification of 400 or more . in this case , the particles are fat globules with a radius of the order of @xmath156 , which appear to be moving randomly at speeds of a few times @xmath157 , due to collisions with water molecules .",
    "one question which one can ask is whether a given  jerk \" of a fat globule can be due to a collision with a single water molecule .",
    "this question may be answered using the results of sect  [ sec : high - end ] . for a water molecule at room temperature , @xmath158 , slightly larger than the corresponding speed of an air molecule due to the lower mass of an @xmath159 molecule .",
    "we assume that the water molecule transfers all of its momentum to the globule , so the recoil speed of the globule is about @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the masses of a water molecule and the globule , respectively , and @xmath163 is the speed of the molecule before the collision .",
    "assume that the globules are spheres of radius @xmath164 and density @xmath165 that of water .",
    "the required speed of a single molecule is @xmath166 this result shows that the answer to this question is extremely sensitive to the size and speed of the globules .",
    "the probability of a single molecule being capable of causing a recoil when @xmath167 and @xmath168 is @xmath169 .",
    "however , if we reduce both the radius and speed of the globule by factors of four , then a significant fraction of the molecules are capable causing the recoil by themselves .",
    "this is another illustration of the powerful effect of the @xmath170 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : high - v ] ) .",
    "even if a single molecule can not impart sufficient momentum , a globule can acquire momentum from the collective collisions with many molecules . on average ,",
    "the same number of molecules hit the globule from either side , so the average momentum acquired is zero .",
    "however , this momentum is subject to statistical fluctuations , so its mean square need not be zero .",
    "here we focus on the average molecules , which have a speed of about @xmath171 at room temperature .",
    "the number of molecules striking a globule in time @xmath172 is of order @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a measure of the cross sectional area of the globule , and @xmath175 is the number density of water molecules .",
    "the momentum carried by these molecules mostly cancels because of nearly equal numbers of molecules hitting opposite sides of the globule .",
    "however , if the different molecular collisions are uncorrelated with one another , then the difference in the number of collisions on the right and left sides of the globules will not be exactly equal , but will differ by about @xmath176 . if damping effects could be ignored , this would lead to a net momentum of the globule of order @xmath177 or an average speed of @xmath178    it is clear from the rapid growth of @xmath179 that damping effects can not be ignored here . instead ,",
    "the drag force described by stoke s law , @xmath180 becomes important . here",
    "@xmath181 is the viscosity coefficient for water at room temperature .",
    "the drag force becomes significant when the drag acceleration becomes comparable to the rate of increase of @xmath179 predicted by eq ,  ( [ eq : vg ] ) , that is , when @xmath182 this occurs when @xmath183 and @xmath184    after a very short time , the motion of the globule becomes diffusive and and its displacement obeys the einstein relation  @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the diffusion coefficient given by @xmath187 this relation describes the motion actually seen in the microscope .",
    "for example , with @xmath188 and @xmath189 , it predicts @xmath190 .",
    "in the previous sections , we have explored selected aspects of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , viewed as a probability distribution .",
    "particular attention was given to the low speed and high speed limits , which illustrate the probability of rare events .",
    "for example , in sect .",
    "[ sec : quantum ] , we examined the probability of finding molecules moving so slowly that they are no longer classical particles , in the sense that their debroglie wavelength exceeds the distance to their nearest neighbor . at room temperature and atmospheric pressure , this fraction is small , but can exceed @xmath66 for @xmath191 . in sect .  [",
    "sec : high - end ] , we looked at the opposite limit of the especially fast molecules , and found a simple expression for the probability of such molecules .",
    "this result was applied to a simplified discussion of jeans escape in sect .",
    "[ sec : escape ] , whereby those molecules with speeds above the escape velocity can escape into interplanetary space .",
    "brownian motion was discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : brown ] .",
    "here we described how this is usually a collective effect due to the collision of the particle with many molecules , not a few especially rapid molecules .",
    "the statistical fluctuations in momentum transferred to the particle lead to a rapid , short time scale growth in the mean squared speed of the particle .",
    "however , damping effects soon become important on a time scale much shorter than can be directly observed in a microscope , leading to the diffusive behavior first described by einstein ."
