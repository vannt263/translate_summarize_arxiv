    "a cork is a contractible smooth 4-manifold with an involution on its boundary that does not extend to a diffeomorphism of the entire manifold .",
    "the first example of a cork was given by akbulut in @xcite .",
    "since then , other examples have been constructed by akbulut - yasui in @xcite , akbulut - yasui in @xcite , and tange in @xcite .",
    "corks can be used to detect exotic structures , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , any two smooth structures on a closed simply - connected 4-manifold differ by a single cork twist , see @xcite .",
    "a cork twist removes an embedded cork and reglues it using the involution .",
    "the involution on the boundary of a cork can be regarded as a @xmath2-action , so it is natural to ask if contractible smooth 4-manifolds with other kinds of effective group actions on the boundaries can also be used to detect exotic structures .",
    "a number of recent papers have answered this in the affirmative , constructing examples of @xmath0-corks , @xmath3 , that embed inside closed smooth 4-manifolds so that removing and regluing using the @xmath4 twists produces @xmath4 distinct smooth structures , see @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-cork is a contractible smooth 4-manifold with an effective @xmath0-action on its boundary so that the twists associated to the non - trivial elements of @xmath0 do not extend to diffeomorphisms of the entire manifold .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use the heegaard floer theoretic argument in @xcite to give a different proof that the examples in @xcite are in fact @xmath0-corks .",
    "these examples are defined as follows .",
    "fix a finite subgroup @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the akbulut cork from @xcite shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "there is an isotopy of @xmath7 that interchanges the two link components on the right side of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this gives an involution @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the boundary sum @xmath11 .",
    "note that its boundary @xmath12 inherits an involution @xmath13 .",
    "define @xmath14 to be the boundary sum of @xmath15 with @xmath16 copies of @xmath10 , namely @xmath17 . so that we get a well - defined action of @xmath0 on @xmath18",
    ", we assume that the @xmath16 copies of @xmath10 are attached along 3-balls in @xmath19 that form a principal orbit under the linear action of @xmath0 on @xmath19 .",
    "then we define the action of @xmath0 on @xmath18 to be the linear action on @xmath19 and left multiplication on the copies of @xmath12 . to get the @xmath0-cork",
    ", we twist a copy @xmath20 of @xmath10 in the interior of @xmath21 by the involution @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the resulting 4-manifold @xmath23 .",
    "note that the action of @xmath0 on @xmath18 descends to an action of @xmath0 on @xmath24 .",
    "then we have the following :    [ thm1 ] @xmath22 is a g - cork .",
    "the heegaard floer theoretic argument also yields the following easy consequence :    [ thm2 ] the @xmath0-action on @xmath24 induces an effective @xmath0-action on @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the plus version of heegaard floer homology and @xmath27 is the unique spin@xmath28 structure on @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basics of heegaard floer homology for 3 and 4-manifolds , contact geometry , stein structures , and lefschetz fibrations .",
    "we use @xmath2 coefficients throughout to avoid ambiguity in sign .",
    "the author would like to thank danny ruberman for helpful conversations .",
    "a part of this work was supported by an nsf igert fellowship under grant number dge-1068620 .",
    "we prove theorem [ thm1 ] first .",
    "we start by equipping @xmath22 with the handle decomposition in figure [ fig:2 ] .    by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.3 ) , @xmath22 can be given a stein structure that extends the standard stein structure on @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath24 inherits a contact structure @xmath29 .",
    "now fix @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; by abuse of notation we view this as a diffeomorphism of @xmath24 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath32 does not extend to a diffeomorphism of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the unique spin@xmath28 structure on @xmath22 ; we also write @xmath27 for its restriction to @xmath24 . by puncturing @xmath22 in the interior",
    "we can view @xmath22 as a cobordism from @xmath33 to @xmath7 .",
    "then we get the cobordism map @xmath34 , see @xcite for details . the twist @xmath32 induces a second cobordism map @xmath35 via the cobordism @xmath36 ) \\mathrel{\\cup_{g } } ( -\\partial \\mathbb{t } \\times [ \\frac{1}{2},1])$ ] .",
    "the bulk of the proof lies in showing the following :        if we replace the dotted 1-handle linking the trefoil with a pair of 3-balls and put the trefoil in legendrian position , then we see that the thurston - bennequiun number of the tangle is 2 , which is 1 more than the framing we started with . by eliashberg s criterion ( *",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) , the stein structure on @xmath22 can be extended over the 2-handle .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the cobordism on @xmath24 induced by the 2-handle attachment .",
    "then @xmath40 inherits a stein structure . by (",
    "* lemma 3.6 ) , we can extend @xmath40 to a concave symplectic filling @xmath41 of @xmath42 so that the closed smooth 4-manifold @xmath43 has @xmath44 and admits the structure of a relatively minimal lefschetz fibration over @xmath45 with generic fiber of genus @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath47 denotes the canonical spin@xmath28 structure on @xmath48 ( and also its restriction to @xmath41 ) , then by ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorem 3.1 ) , @xmath60 does not have any basic classes , so for every spin@xmath28 structure @xmath65 on @xmath60 , the mixed homomorphism @xmath66 is identically zero . separately",
    ", we have a homeomorphism @xmath67 that is the identity on @xmath41 .",

    "note that @xmath68 restricted to @xmath41 is the spin@xmath28 structure @xmath47 .",
    "then we have @xmath69    having proved the main technical lemma , we now finish off the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "suppose to the contrary the diffeomorphism @xmath63 extends to a diffeomorphism @xmath70 .",
