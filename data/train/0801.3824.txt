    "the transport properties of quantum wire systems have been the subject of intensive investigation in the past one and a half decade , both because they can have practical applications in nano - electronic circuits and because they provide an experimentally realizable way for understanding exotic properties of one - dimensional interacting electron systems .",
    "as opposed to two- and three - dimensional electronic systems , one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems can not be described by fermi liquid theory ; instead , they are described as tomonaga - luttinger liquids ( tll )  , and experiments on carbon nanotubes are consistent with this description  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a number of studies of junctions of multiple tll wires  @xcite .",
    "such studies are relevant because junctions of three or more quantum wires would inevitably appear in any quantum circuit .",
    "new tools and methods for investigating junctions of three quantum wires with _ spinless _ electrons were proposed in ref .",
    "these new methods allowed for the identification of a low energy chiral fixed point with an asymmetric current flow that is highly sensitive to the sign of the magnetic flux enclosed at the junction .",
    "there are , however , important outstanding issues in the three - wire junctions problem , for instance , the behavior of the more realistic model in which the electron spin is taken into account .    even in the case of tunneling between two wires ,",
    "the inclusion of spin degrees of freedom already brings about a rich phase diagram in the charge and spin interaction parameter space  @xcite .",
    "for example , one can find a situation where the charge conductance vanishes while the spin conductance does not , or vice versa . in the case of junctions of three quantum wires ( y - junction ) for electrons with spin ,",
    "the phase diagram becomes much richer .",
    "in addition to a phase similar to the two - wire case in which electron pair tunneling dominates while the spin conductance vanishes , or vice versa , the chiral fixed point revealed previously in the spinless y - junction case persists when the spin degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "moreover , while the strong asymmetric limit in which one of the wires is totally decoupled was proved always unstable for the spinless case  @xcite , we find a small region in the coupling parameter space in which this asymmetric fixed point is stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we summarize the results and present the phase diagram in coupling constant space at zero temperature .",
    "we also discuss the conductance tensor corresponding to each stable fixed point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present our effective model for the junctions of three quantum wires for spin-1/2 electrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : debc ] we review the delayed evaluation of boundary condition ( debc ) method introduced previously for identifying the stable fixed points for the y - junction system with spinless electrons . taking advantage of charge / spin separation in one dimension , we generalize this approach to the system with spin-1/2 electrons and illustrate the method by describing the phase diagram of a junction of two quantum wires . in sec .",
    "[ sec : debc - three - junction ] we apply the debc method described in sec .  [ sec : debc ] to the y - junction with spin 1/2 electrons and determine the stability of each fixed point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bcft - review ] we briefly review the method of boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) and apply it , as a warm up , to study a junction of two quantum wires .",
    "we then apply bcft methods to the y - junction problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : bcft - three - junction ] , and obtain results consistent with those found with the debc method .",

    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize our study of the stability of the fixed points associated with the different boundary conditions of y - junctions for spin-1/2 electrons and their corresponding conductance tensors .",
    "based on the stability of each phase , we propose a zero - temperature phase diagram in terms of the tll interaction parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the geometry of the device is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : devicea ] , where three identical quantum wires are attached to a ring , with equal couplings and thus having a @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the ring can be threaded by a magnetic flux and the quantum wires are modelled as tlls characterized by the interaction parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will only consider spin conserving transport .    due to the charge and spin separation in the bulk of tll quantum wires ,",
    "independent boundary conditions can be imposed on the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , we introduce the notation @xmath4 in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the corresponding boundary condition in the charge and spin sector respectively . for instance , dn represents dirichlet boundary condition ( b.c . ) in the charge sector and neumann b.c . in the spin sector",
    "moreover , since each combination of the boundary conditions corresponds to a fixed point in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) , the fixed point corresponding to @xmath4 bc will be referred to as _ @xmath4 fixed point_. the physical meaning of each boundary condition will be discussed in this section and the detailed analysis and assumptions of the model are given in later sections .     a junction of three quantum wires with a magnetic flux threading through the ring .",
    "the @xmath7 are the charge and spin currents arriving at the junction from each of the three wires .",
    "the lighter line ( blue online ) indicates the charge sector , and the darker line ( red online ) presents the spin sector . ]",
    "the charge and spin conductance tensors associated with each fixed point are important physical response functions characterizing the y - junction for spin 1/2 electrons . within the linear response theory ,",
    "the total current @xmath8 flowing into the junction from wire @xmath9 is related to the voltage applied at the wire @xmath10 through @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 conductance tensor .",
    "one can similarly define , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the chemical potential difference between up and down spins in lead @xmath10 , and @xmath17 is the electron charge ( with this definition , spin and charge conductances are both measured in units of @xmath18 ) .",
    "note that current conservation implies that : @xmath19 furthermore , a common voltage applied to all three wires results in zero current .",
    "thus : @xmath20    for @xmath2 symmetry junctions , the conductance tensor takes the form  @xcite @xmath21 where we separate the symmetric and anti - symmetric components of the tensor , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are scalar conductances .",

    "even in the presence of the magnetic flux which would normally break time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , @xmath23 may vanish at some low energy fixed points , in which case time reversal symmetry is restored .",
    "however , in the absence of the @xmath2 symmetry ( in the asymmetric fixed point ) , the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : z3tensor ] ) becomes unnecessary .",
    "observe that @xmath29 represents the conductance of each wire when zero voltage is applied to the other two wires ( _ i.e. _ , a potential difference is applied between one of the wires and the other two , which are held at the same potential ) .",
    "we are mostly interested in the stable rg fixed points which describe the physics in the low energy limit , i.e. low voltage bias and low temperature . as in the case of junctions of two quantum wires ,",
    "the interaction parameters control the stability of the fixed points and determine the phase diagram .",
    "below we list our results for conductance tensors and for the basins of attraction around each fixed point ( with their corresponding boundary conditions ) as function of the interaction parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "the nn boundary condition corresponds to a fixed point in which the hopping amplitudes between the wires are zero and the three quantum wires are totally decoupled from each other , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",

    "moreover , the conductance tensor takes the symmetric form in which the scalar conductance @xmath37 and the antisymmetric component @xmath38 , and is given by @xmath39 here , the factor of @xmath40 comes from the doubling of the degrees of freedom due to the spin . since @xmath38",

    "the @xmath48 fixed point can be stable when @xmath50 while the @xmath49 can be stable when @xmath51  @xcite . as a result , the charge and spin current always flow together for spin 1/2 electrons , i.e. mixed chiral fixed points , @xmath52 , are never stable .",

    "<S> we study the effects of electron - electron interactions on the transport properties of a junction of three quantum wires enclosing a magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> the wires are modeled as single channel spin-1/2 tomonaga - luttinger liquids . </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits a rich phase diagram as a function of the electronic interaction strength , which includes a chiral fixed point with an asymmetric current flow highly sensitive to the sign of the flux , and another fixed point where pair tunneling dominates , similarly to the case of spinless electrons . </S>",
    "<S> while in the case of spinless electrons the perturbations that correspond to unequal couplings between the three wires are always irrelevant , we find that , when the electron spin is included , there are small regions in the phase diagram where a current flows only between two of the wires and the third wire is decoupled . </S>"
