    ", on the other hand , has been realized more recently @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that @xcite `` while in traditional database management managing uncertainty and lineage seems like a nice feature , in data integration it becomes a necessity . ''",
    "the widely accepted conceptual model for uncertain data is the possible - worlds model @xcite . for practical applications ,",
    "a representation of choice is the probabilistic relation model @xcite , which provides a compact and efficient representation for uncertain data .",
    "we have shown that integration of uncertain data represented in the probabilistic relation model can be achieved efficiently using the extended probabilistic relation model @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the integration of _ probabilistic _ uncertain data .",
    "we study the problem of determining the probability distribution of the integration result .",
    "a recent work has shown how to obtain probability _ ranges _ for the result of integration @xcite .",
    "we study this problem in two frameworks : the probabilistic possible - worlds model , and the probabilistic relation model .",
    "we show that , under intuitive and reasonable assumptions , we can determine the exact probability distribution of integration in either of the frameworks .",
    "further , we show that the two approaches are equivalent while the probabilistic relation approach provides a significantly more efficient method in practice .",
    "we make the following contributions    * we review the integration problem in the probabilistic possible - worlds model , and show why , in the general case , it is only possible to determine probability ranges for the integration result . *",
    "we add an intuitive an realistic assumption regarding the probabilistic correlation of the inputs , and show that under this assumption exact probability distribution can be obtained for the integration result .",
    "* we concentrate on the integration problem in the probabilistic relation framework .",
    "we show that adding an intuitive and realistic assumption in this framework makes it possible to determine exact probability distribution for the integration . *",
    "we show that the two approaches are equivalent in the following sense .",
    "first , the assumptions in the two frameworks , although different in appearence , are indeed equivalent .",
    "second , given the same inputs , the probability distributions obtained in the two approaches are the same .",
    "this equivalence is a strong justification of the robustness of our approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we summarize some of the important concepts and results from @xcite in section  [ sec : prelim ] , and discuss the problem of integrating probabilistic data in section  [ sec : prob - integ ] . _ integrated extended probabilistic relations _ are introduced in section  [ sec : pr - framework ] .",
    "we study their properties , and present algorithms for determining if an epr - relation is the result of data integration .",
    "section  [ sec : prob - computation ] is devoted to the discussion of computing probability distribution for the result of an integration .",
    "we present two approaches , and show they are equivalent .",
    "this is a further justification of our probability computation solutions .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "foundations of uncertain information integration were discussed in the seminal work of agrawal _ et al _ @xcite . they discuss the fundamental concept of _ containment _ for uncertain databases , and introduce alternative formulations for _ equality _ and _ superset containment_. equality containment integration is more restrictive and applies to cases where each information source has access only to a portion of an uncertain database that is existing but unknown .",
    "superset containment integration is applicable in settings where we have uncertain data about the real world from multiple sources and wish to integrate the data to obtain the real world .",
    "the goal of integration is to obtain the best possible uncertain database that contains all the information implied by sources , and nothing more .",
    "an alternative formulation to superset - containment - based integration was presented in @xcite .",
    "these approaches are based on the well - known _ possible - worlds _ model of uncertain information @xcite .",
    "the possible - worlds model is widely accepted as the conceptual model for uncertain information , and is used as the theoretical basis for operations and algorithms on uncertain data .",
    "but it is not , in general , a suitable representation for the _ implementation _ of uncertain information systems due to lack of efficiency . instead , compact representations , such as the _ probabilistic relation model _",
    "@xcite , are more appropriate for the implementation .",
    "the problem of integration of information represented by probabilistic relations has been studied in @xcite , which presents efficient algorithms for the integration . in this section",
    ", we will review some of the observations and results from these works .",
    "let us begin with the following definition of _ uncertain database _ from @xcite .",
    "[ def : uncertaindb ] an _ uncertain database _ @xmath0 consists of a finite set of tuples @xmath1 and a nonempty set of possible worlds @xmath2 , where each @xmath3 is a certain database .",
    "this definition adds tuple - set @xmath1 to the possible - worlds model .",
    "in fact , there may be tuples in the tuple set that do not appear in any possible world of the uncertain database @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath1 is not provided explicitly , then we use the set of all tuples in the possible worlds as the tuple set , , @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this model exhibits both closed - world and open - world properties : if a tuple @xmath5 does not appear in a possible world @xmath6 , then it is assumed to be _ false _ for @xmath6 ( hence , closed - world assumption ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath6 explicitly rules out @xmath7 .",
    "the justification is that the source providing the uncertain information represented by @xmath0 is aware of ( the information represented by ) all @xmath5 .",
    "if some @xmath5 is absent from @xmath6 , then the source explicitly rules out @xmath7 from @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "a tuple @xmath8 is assumed possible for possible - worlds @xmath6 ( hence , open - world assumption ) .",
    "this distinction is important for integration : consider integrating @xmath6 from one source with a possible - world @xmath9 from another source . let a tuple @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "for the first case ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath9 are not compatible and can not be integrated .",
    "this is because @xmath6 explicitly rules out @xmath7 while @xmath9 explicitly includes it . on the other hand , for the second case ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath9",
    "can be integrated since @xmath6 can accept @xmath7 as a valid tuple .",
    "the following example from @xcite demonstrates the above observations .",
    "[ ex : scenario2 ] andy and jane are talking about fellow student bob .",
    "andy says `` i am taking three courses , cs100 , cs101 , and cs102 , and bob is in one of cs100 or cs101 ( but not both ) . ''",
    "jane says `` i am taking cs101 and csc102 and bob is in one of them ( but not both ) . ''",
    "these statements are represented by the possible - world relations shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-1 ] .",
    "but andy s tuple - set contains ( bob , cs102 ) hence , his statement also implies that bob can not be in cs102 .",
    "so the result of integration is that bob is taking cs101 , shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-1 ] .",
    "note that if andy s tuple set did not contain ( bob , cs102 ) , i.e. , if he was taking only cs100 and cs101 and had noticed bob in one of them , then his possible - world relations would still be the same .",
    "but the result of integration in this case would contain a second possibility that bob is taking both cs100 and cs102 .",
    "this case is shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-2 ] .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be information sources with possible worlds @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the tuple - sets of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we need the following definition .",
    "[ def : compatible ] a pair of possible - world relations @xmath6 and @xmath9 are _ compatible _ if for each tuple @xmath18 either both @xmath6 and @xmath19 contain @xmath7 ( , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , or neither @xmath6 nor @xmath9 contain @xmath7 ( , @xmath11 and @xmath22 ) . otherwise @xmath6 and @xmath9 are not compatible .    given information sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the integration algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : integ - pw ] ) considers all possible - world pairs from the two sources . if they are compatible , their union forms a possible - world of the integration .",
    "given information sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 with possible worlds @xmath14 and @xmath15 and tuple sets @xmath16 and @xmath17 for every pair of possible - world relations @xmath23    if @xmath6 and @xmath9 are compatible then let @xmath24    end    the possible - worlds model of the result of integrating @xmath12 and @xmath13 has the tuple set @xmath25 , and the set of possible - world relations @xmath26 for every compatible pair @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "in example  [ ex : scenario2 ] , the tuple sets for the two sources ( andy and jane ) are \\{(bob , cs100 ) , ( bob , cs101 ) , ( bob , cs102 ) } and \\{(bob , cs101 ) , ( bob , cs102 ) } , respectively .",
    "it is easy to verify that in this case the only compatible pair of possible - world relations are the second relation of andy and the first relation of jane ( see figure  [ fig : andy - jane-1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the integration result is \\{(bob , cs101 ) } as shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-1 ] .    for case 2 , the only difference is that the tuple set for andy is \\{(bob , cs100 ) , ( bob , cs101)}. hence there are two pairs of compatible possible - world relations : in addition to second relation of andy and first relation of jane being compatible , we also have first relation of andy compatible with second relation of jane .",
    "this results in two possible - world relations in the integration : \\{(bob , cs101 ) } and \\{(bob , cs100 ) , ( bob , csc102 ) } as shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-2 ] .",
    "a logic - based approach to the representation and integration of uncertain data in the possible - world model was presented in @xcite , and shown to be equivalent to the superset - containment - based integration of @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show the above algorithm is equivalent to the logic - based and superset - containment - based integration .",
    "a number of models have been proposed for the representation of uncertain information such as the `` maybe '' tuples model @xcite , set of alternatives or block - independent disjoint model ( bid ) @xcite , the probabilistic relation model @xcite , and the u - relational database model @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the probabilistic relation model as a compact representation of uncertain data for the integration of uncertain data @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this representation is based on the relational model where each tuple @xmath7 is associated with a propositional logic formula @xmath27 ( called an _",
    "event _ in @xcite . ) the boolean variables in the formulas are called _ event variables_. a probabilistic relation @xmath28 represents the set of possible - world relations corresponding to truth assignments to the set of event variables . a truth assignment @xmath29 defines a possible - world relation @xmath30 .",
    "probabilistic relations for the possible - worlds shown in figure  [ fig : andy - jane-1 ] ( andy and jane case 1 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : pr - for - andy - jane ] .",
    "bob & cs101 & @xmath31 + bob & cs102 & _ false _",
    "+     bob & cs102 & @xmath32 +      as mentioned earlier , for efficiency reasons a compact representation of uncertain data is utilized in practice .",
    "we will summarize an algorithm for the integration of uncertain data represented in the probabilistic relation model from @xcite .",
    "first we need the following definition from @xcite .",
    "[ def - epr - relation ] an _ extended probabilistic relation _ is a probabilistic relation with a set of _ event constraints_. each event constraint is a propositional formula in event variables .",
    "semantics of an extended probabilistic relation is similar to that of probabilistic relation , with the exception that only truth assignments that satisfy event constraints are considered .",
    "more specifically , a truth assignment @xmath29 to event variables is _ valid _ if it satisfies all event constraints .",
    "a valid truth assignment @xmath29 defines a relation instance @xmath30 , where @xmath27 is the event formula associated with tuple @xmath7 in @xmath28 .",
    "the extended probabilistic relation @xmath28 represents the set of relations , called its possible - world set , defined by the set of all valid truth assignments to the event variables .",
    "we will use abbreviations _ pr - relation _ and _ epr - relation _ for probabilistic relation and extended probabilistic relation henceforth .",
    "given information sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 , let @xmath28 and @xmath33 be the pr - relations that represent the data in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we represent a tuple in a pr - relation as @xmath34 , where @xmath7 is the pure tuple , and @xmath35 is the propositional event formula associated with @xmath7 . let @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the event formula associated with the tuple @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath39 .",
    "we assume the set of event variables of @xmath28 ( , event variables appearing in formulas @xmath40 ) and those of @xmath33 ( , event variables appearing in formulas @xmath41 ) to be disjoint . if not , a simple renaming can be used to make the two sets disjoint . @xmath28 and @xmath33 can have zero or more common tuples .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath28 and @xmath33 have @xmath42 tuples in common , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the integration algorithm is represented in algorithm  [ alg : integ - pr ] . in algorithm",
    "[ alg : integ - pr ] , @xmath45 is equivalent to the logical formula @xmath46 . we will use the notation @xmath47 to mean that @xmath48 is the epr - relation that is the result of integration of pr - relations @xmath28 and @xmath49 .    given information sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 , let @xmath28 and @xmath33 be the pr - relations that represent the data in @xmath12 and @xmath13 as above .",
    "the result of integration of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is represented by an epr - relation @xmath48 obtained as follows :    * copy to @xmath48 the tuples in @xmath28 that are not in common with @xmath33 , that is , @xmath50 . *",

    "step 2 labels @xmath233 with @xmath121 and @xmath235 with @xmath122 , while @xmath234 remains unlabeled .",
    "hence , there are two ways to obtain the partition for theorem  [ thm : integrated ] : by combining @xmath234 with @xmath121 ; or by combining @xmath234 with @xmath122 .",

    "hence , the event - variable for @xmath265 is @xmath267 as shown in section  [ sec : evf - integ ] .    now consider the alternative pr - relation pair @xmath33 and @xmath152 that differ from @xmath28 and @xmath49 in a single tuple , say @xmath260 .",
