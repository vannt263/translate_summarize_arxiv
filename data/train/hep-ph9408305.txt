    "stimulated by recent  @xcite and planned  @xcite experiments with polarized electron and proton beams , spin - dependent distribution functions have received a lot of attention . due to increasing accuracy , measurements of higher - twist distributions seem feasible in the near future .",
    "they are particularly interesting , since they contain valuable information on quark - gluon correlations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze the role of quark transverse momentum in the twist - three distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , or equivalently the linear combinations @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    at leading - order level",
    ", one may consider transverse - momentum - dependent distributions which can be measured in drell - yan ( dy ) scattering at small but fixed @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) or in dy integrated over @xmath9 one measures the distributions integrated over transverse momentum ; these are the twist - two unpolarized momentum distribution @xmath10 and two twist - two spin - dependent distributions , the helicity distribution @xmath11 and the transverse spin distribution @xmath12 . at",
    "leading order it does not matter what the transverse momentum dependence is ; the observables ( i.e. , structure functions and asymmetries ) do not change if one assumes zero transverse momentum [ i.e. , @xmath13 distributions . at subleading @xmath3 ,",
    "the situation is less simple . as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , assuming free quarks without transverse momentum gives the non - physical result @xmath14 .",
    "thus , even though @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not depend explicitly on @xmath15 , assuming zero transverse momentum may considerably alter their shape ( in @xmath16 ) .",
    "we will make these statements more precise in due course .",
    "first , let us recall some facts about the transverse spin - dependent distribution @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "using operator - product - expansion ( ope ) techniques , one shows that @xmath5 can be decomposed in three pieces , a twist - two part depending on @xmath11 , also known as the wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) term  @xcite , a quark - mass part depending on @xmath12  @xcite , and an explicitly interaction - dependent part .",
    "the latter is the most interesting , since it is sensitive to off - shellness and confinement effects . instead of using the ope , we rederive the different terms , using nonlocal matrix elements only . in this approach",
    "the transverse momentum of quarks is an essential ingredient .",
    "the nonlocal matrix element that fixes the interaction - dependent part contains two good quark fields and one transverse gluon field , so that it can be given a clear parton interpretation  @xcite .",
    "of course , if moments are taken , one should recover the ope local matrix elements . in this formalism",
    "it is also straightforward to derive the burkhardt - cottingham ( bc ) sum rule @xmath17  @xcite , although one must make assumptions .",
    "the status of the bc sum rule is less rigorous than , for instance , the bjorken sum rule .",
    "it was claimed that in perturbation theory it is valid at least up to @xmath18  @xcite , although recently this claim was disputed  @xcite .",
    "the twist - three distribution function @xmath6  @xcite is less well - known .",
    "it does not occur in the inclusive dis cross section other than multiplied with a quark - mass factor ( like @xmath12 , it is chirally odd ) .",
    "nonetheless , one can analyze it using the ope - based techniques  @xcite .",
    "again one finds three parts ; a twist - two part depending on @xmath12 , a quark - mass part depending on @xmath11 , and an interaction - dependent part .",
    "the interaction dependent part can also be given a parton interpretation@xcite .",
    "using the same techniques as for @xmath0 , we derive within our approach these parts , expressing them in a finite number of nonlocal matrix elements .",
    "we derive a sum rule very similar to the bc sum rule , namely , @xmath19 .    in order to support our claim that explicit treatment of quark transverse momenta is important at twist - three",
    ", we consider @xmath9-averaged polarized dy scattering .",
    "jaffe and ji derived an @xmath3 asymmetry , @xmath4 , for longitudinally - transversely polarized dy scattering  @xcite . in their calculation",
    "they assumed zero quark transverse momentum . without this assumption",
    "we find modifications in the asymmetry . to estimate the difference between the two results we use bag - model distributions .",
    "the difference turns out to be considerable .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we analyze the content of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , using lorentz symmetry , discrete symmetries and the qcd equations of motion .",
    "we decompose the distributions in the three different parts , and derive the sum rules . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we calculate the polarized dis hadron tensor , emphasising the role of transverse momentum . in sec .  [ sec4 ] , the more involved but essentially similar hadronic tensor for polarized dy scattering is considered , from which follows the double - spin asymmetry .",
    "in this section we decompose the polarized twist - three distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 into their building blocks of different dynamical origin . instead of using conventional ope techniques , we work directly with the nonlocal quark - quark and quark - gluon - quark matrix elements . in the calculation of a specific cross section",
    "these matrix elements appear as the non - calculable parts in the diagrammatic expansion of the amplitude , i.e. , those parts that connect hadron lines to quark or gluon lines .",
    "first , we will expand the quark - quark and quark - gluon - quark correlation functions as needed up to @xmath3 , using hermiticity , as well as lorentz invariance , parity invariance , and time - reversal invariance .",
