    "as the nearest major external galaxy and possibly the dominant member of the local group , messier  31 has received a great deal of attention since its first documented telescopic observation by simon marius in 1612 @xcite .",
    "the many stellar and gaseous constituents of m31 continue to be studied with ever greater sensitivity and resolution , permitting insights that are in many cases difficult or even impossible to achieve for our own galaxy given our vantage point within the disk .",
    "one of these areas , where an external yet nearby vantage point is crucial to achieving a global overview , is the study of the neutral interstellar medium .",
    "although we can achieve remarkable physical sensitivity and resolution of the neutral medium of the galaxy , resolving individual structures of 100 s of au in size and as little as several jupiter masses @xcite , it is very difficult to estimate even the total mass of the neutral medium , let alone its overall distribution and relationship with other components .",
    "studies of the neutral medium of m31 began with the pioneering work of @xcite as one of the first programs undertaken with the dwingeloo 25 m telescope .",
    "subsequent studies with larger single dishes and then with interferometric arrays have provided enhanced resolution and brightness sensitivity , although the highest resolution studies have often only been directed at a portion of the disk ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe our westerbork and green bank telescope program to image the entire atomic disk of m31 with a uniformly high sensitivity and resolution .",
    "the most recent effort on a comparable scale was that of @xcite which achieved arcmin spatial and 16 km  s@xmath0  velocity resolution with an rms noise of 3.6  k in two elliptical fields covering about 12 square degrees .",
    "by contrast we will present imaging down to 15  spatial and 2.3 km  s@xmath0  velocity resolution ( sampled at 2 km  s@xmath0 ) with a uniform 2.7  k rms over a region of about 24 ( 7@xmath13.5 ) square degrees .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum linear resolution of about 50  pc over a total extent of more than 90  kpc . with",
    "even modest spatial smoothing we reach sub - kelvin brightness sensitivity ( for example 0.37  k at 1 arcmin ) , making our database the most detailed documentation yet of the neutral medium of any complete galaxy disk , including our own .",
    "for comparison , the leiden / argentine / bonn survey of galactic has achieved 36 arcmin and 1.3  km  s@xmath0  resolution over 360 degrees and reaches 0.08  k rms @xcite and the large magellanic cloud survey of @xcite achieves 1  arcmin and 1.7  km  s@xmath0  resolution over 12@xmath110 degrees and reaches 2.5  k rms .",
    "we begin with a description of the observations and their reduction in  [ sec : obse ] and continue with an overview of the results in  [ sec : resu ] . in  [ sec : disc ] we present some initial analysis of the data , beginning with a discussion of self - opaque features and followed by a detailed fitting of all high signal - to - noise spectra to determine the best fitting combination of the physical parameters along each line - of - sight : cool component temperature , total column density and non - thermal velocity dispersion .",
    "we continue with the analysis of radial dependence for the relevant physical parameters and finally we focus on the relationship between surface density of gas mass and star formation rate .",
    "we close with some brief conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume a distance to m31 of 785  kpc @xcite throughout .",
    "further papers in this series will include : ( 1 ) a detailed kinematic- and mass - model of m31 , ( 2 ) comparative studies of the morphology of the inner and outer disks and ( 3 ) a study of small - scale kinematic features such as outflows and other peculiar velocity components .",
    "interferometric observations of the extended m31 disk with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) array were obtained on a nyquist sampled ( 15 arcmin spacing ) pointing grid defined in the m31 ( major , minor ) axis coordinate system .",
    "the disk extent was first determined in a precursor total power survey which fully sampled a 6@xmath16 degree field at low resolution ( 36 fwhm ) using the 14 individual telescopes of the wsrt array .",
    "a total of 163 synthesis pointing positions were chosen from the grid to provide good coverage of the region of anticipated emission .",
    "observations were then obtained for 27 tracks of 12 hour duration with the wsrt array , each sampling 6 ( or in one case 7 ) different pointing positions .",
    "these data were observed between august 2001 and january 2002 .",
    "each 12 hour track involved cycling through the 6 relevant pointing positions with a series of 10 minute snap - shots .",
    "the tracks were preceeded by half hour observations of the calibration sources 3c286 and ctd93 and followed by half hour observations of 3c147 and cta21 .",
    "a total band - width of 5  mhz ( covering heliocentric radial velocities between @xmath5828 and @xmath6227  km  s@xmath0 ) was observed with 512 spectral channels in two linear polarization products yielding a channel width of 2.06  km  s@xmath0  and resolution of 2.27  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "calibration and flagging of the data were done in classic aips .",
    "after external band - pass and gain calibration , each pointing was self - calibrated using the continuum emission which happened to be present .",
    "the continuum model was subtracted from the visibilities and residual continuum was removed with uvlin .",
    "sensitive total power data covering a 7@xmath17 degree field was acquired with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) telescope over six nights in september 2002 .",
    "these data , with 91 fwhm @xmath1 1.03  km  s@xmath0  resolution and an rms sensitivity in column density over relevant linewidths of about 5@xmath7  cm@xmath3 , have already been presented in @xcite .",
    "a joint deconvolution of all 163 pointings was done with the miriad @xcite task mossdi , after forming a weighted sum of the linearly combined synthesis image ( employing uniform weighting followed by a gaussian taper ) with the relevant gbt total power image .",
    "each of the 163 synthesized beams was also modified by addition of a gaussian approximation of the total power beam using the same relative weightings as used when summing the synthesis and total power images .",
    "the relative weightings were determined empirically by minimizing the `` short - spacing bowl '' effect in the synthesis beams , but they correspond roughly to the inverse of the relative beam areas .",
    "the exact choice of weighting is not critical , in theory , since the process of deconvolution should yield an `` ideal '' final psf if all emission has been successfully incorporated into the component model . in practise",
    "it is never possible to incorporate all emission into the component model , so it is important to make the `` dirty '' psf as clean as possible ( particularly with respect to diffuse emission ) by an optimized choice of weights .",
    "the linearly combined `` dirty '' mosaic images were multiplied with the combined wsrt survey sensitivity pattern in order to weight down the noise around the periphery of the sampled region before deconvolution .",
    "if this were not done , then the noisy periphery would be severely over - cleaned relative to the central regions , yielding greatly reduced image fidelity .",
    "the assumption underlying this spatial tapering is that the region of significant emission is contained within the sampling pattern .",
    "we will comment below on the extent to which this assumption was met in practise .",
    "the 300 semi - independent spectral channels ( each of 2  km  s@xmath0  width ) containing m31 s emission ( heliocentric velocities of about @xmath5621 to @xmath520 km  s@xmath0 ) were processed individually .",
    "foreground emission from the galaxy is present in the field of m31 at velocities between about @xmath5130 and @xmath645 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "reduction of the wsrt data over the full velocity range of galactic emission was not undertaken at this time .",
    "the gbt total power images at velocities between @xmath5130 and @xmath520 km  s@xmath0  were modified by subtraction of the median value determined outside of the region occupied by the m31 disk before combination with the wsrt mosaic to simplify the deconvolution problem .",
    "a positive pedestal of emission underlying the entire galaxy is a needless complication that undermines image fidelity in the deconvolved result .    given the non - linear nature of the deconvolution process and the desire to probe a variety of different output spatial ( `` full''=184@xmath1148 ( ns@xmath1ew ) , 30 , 60and 120 ) and velocity ( 2.3 , 6.2 , 10.3 , and 18.5 km  s@xmath0 ) resolutions , we carried out the joint deconvolution independently for each different combination of these parameters .",
    "deconvolution was in all cases done to a depth of twice the theoretical rms noise level at each resolution .",
    "a bug in the mossdi source code was remedied ( affording it protection against a negative loop gain ) .",
    "a small adjustment was also made to the primary beam model employed within miriad for the wsrt telescopes .",
    "it was found empirically , that a small increase ( by 5 % ) in the assumed fwhm of the analytic approximation ( @xmath9 for a constant @xmath10 at frequency @xmath11 in terms of the radius @xmath12 ) for the beam pattern yielded the highest dynamic range in the mosaic result .",
    "the slightly larger than expected beam size ( 2110 arcsec fwhm rather than 2013 arcsec at 1420 mhz ) has since been verified by direct measurement @xcite .",
    "the resulting rms noise levels at various spatial and velocity resolutions are listed in table  [ tab : sens ] .",
    "note that unlike the case of total power observations of galactic , the detected m31 emission in our synthesis images does not contribute significantly to the measured antenna temperature of each dish , and therefore does not give rise to an increase of the system temperature .",

    "it extensively exploits parallelism at several levels : multi - threading ( on machines that have multiple cpus ) and vectorization ( using sse ( streaming simd extensions ) instructions which are available on most contemporary processors ) .",
    "furthermore , we used task - level parallelism by dividing different reduction pipelines ( specific resolutions and spectral channels ) over multiple machines .",
    "the `` netherlands grid '' infrastructure provided us with the resources to do the computational work .",
    "using these techniques , we were able to perform all reductions ( 16 different resolutions , 300 semi - independent spectral channels ) in 36 hours of elapsed time . a previous attempt to carry out the same processing , before code optimization and using only a single high - end server , required several months of elapsed time .",
    "although data products at all 16 different resolutions were generated directly from the visibility data , we also produced velocity - averaged data products at a fixed spatial resolution by averaging the individually processed channels after deconvolution .",
    "superior dynamic range was found for these post - deconvolution averaged products at spatial resolution of both 60 and 120 arcseconds , while the directly imaged products were superior at full and 30 arcsecond resolutions .",
    "apparently , different deconvolution limitations dominate in these two regimes . at high spatial resolutions ,",
    "the increased signal - to - noise ratio afforded by visibility - based velocity smoothing improves the recovery of extended emission structures , while at low spatial resolutions we already encounter the finite image fidelity of the deconvolution in an individual velocity channel . in this case , averaging spectral images after deconvolution can improve the dynamic range of the result .",
    "the nominal rms noise levels after spectral smoothing scale simply with the square root of the eventual velocity resolution .",
    "column density sensitivity at an appropriate spectral smoothing for faint emission features ( of 18.5  km  s@xmath0 ) is tabulated in table  [ tab : sens ] at a series of spatial resolutions .",
    "images of the peak observed line brightness and the integrated brightness and associated mean velocity ( the 0@xmath13 and 1@xmath14 moments ) were produced at each resolution after first masking the data - cube .",
    "the mask was constructed from the cube of 120 arcsec and 18 km  s@xmath0  resolution , by first blanking brightnesses below 1.5@xmath15 and then interactively masking with an arbitrary polygon the `` island '' of most significant emission at each velocity .",
    "interactive isolation of m31 emission was most critical in the velocity range that overlaps that of the galaxy ( @xmath5130 to @xmath520 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "subtraction of the off - m31 median total power before deconvolution already served to place the m31 emission on a plausible base level . only a single",
    "contiguous ( both spatially and in velocity ) `` island '' of emission at each velocity was included in the blanking mask .",
    "although isolated features in the field may be associated with m31 , we are unaware of how to distinguish them from features in the galactic foreground .",
    "all features in the field which were not contiguously connected with the m31 disk emission were presumed to be part of the galactic foreground and were excluded .",
    "images of integrated brightness were rescaled to represent column density assuming a negligible line opacity .",
    "although this is the usual assumption , it is clear that it is incorrect in practise . @xcite",
    "have applied a simple , single temperature opacity correction to the observed brightnesses from the north - east half of m31 and find local corrections of a factor of 2 and an integrated correction of some 20% .",
    "we address the issue of opacity in greater detail below by directly fitting physical models to individual spectra for all lines - of - sight .",
    "another useful type of image for diagnostic purposes is that of `` velocity coherence '' ( vc ) ( as first introduced by @xcite ) , defined as the ratio of peak brightness at two different spectral resolutions .",
    "for example , vc@xmath16 / @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the peak brightness observed at a spectral resolution of @xmath19  km  s@xmath0 . in the absence of noise , @xmath20 , when comparing coarser with finer spectral resolutions , since an infinitely broad spectral feature will always retain the same peak brightness ( vc  =  1 ) , while an extremely narrow feature will be strongly diluted ( vc  @xmath21  0 ) . images of velocity coherence are a robust measure of linewidth , since no assumption regarding the intrinsic line - shape , nor reliance on a fitting algorithm are required for it s calculation . moreover , even when spectra become multi - valued , as they do in highly inclined ( like m31 ) or kinematically disturbed systems , the vc can continue to probe the attributes of the dominant spectral feature along each line - of - sight rather than a smeared version of all spectral content . in the particular case of an intrinsically gaussian line profile with dispersion , @xmath15 , that is fully resolved at the higher resolution and then convolved with a heaviside ( top - hat ) function of width , @xmath22 ,",
    "one gets the relation , @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "an overview of the joint deconvolution result is shown in figure  [ fig : mp120overfig ] where the wsrt mosaic sensitivity pattern is overlaid on a low resolution ( 120 arcsec , 10  km  s@xmath0 ) image of peak brightness .",
    "the karma package @xcite has been employed for many of the illustrations .",
    "sensitivity contours are shown at 10 and 50% of the peak sensitivity which results from the sampling pattern .",
    "the combined sensitivity pattern has what turn out to be unfortunate local minima on either side of the minor axis .",
    "although little evidence for emission was discerned at these locations in our pilot wsrt total power observations , it is clearly present in the more sensitive total power data that we have acquired since ( @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". diffuse patches of emission are apparent on both sides of the minor axis .",
    "the apparent termination of these minor axis extensions is likely influenced by the multiplication of the brightness distribution with the sensitivity pattern ( to control noise amplification during deconvolution , as outlined in  [ sec : obse ] above ) .",
    "more extensive sampling of the minor axis with additional mosaic pointings will be required for high fidelity imaging at arcmin resolution .",
    "our total power data ( with up to 9 arcmin resolution ) do not suffer from this limitation .",
    "similar attenuation affects davies cloud ( @xcite , @xcite ) the diffuse structure at @xmath24=425 to the northwest of the m31 disk .",
    "the southernmost of the clumps at @xmath24=388 and due south of m31 @xcite is also somewhat attenuated .",
    "sensitive pointed observations of these features are presented in @xcite .",
    "greater detail can be discerned in figure  [ fig : mp60fig ] in which peak brightness is shown as determined at 60 arcsec ( 220  pc ) and 6 km  s@xmath0  resolution , although even at this modest resolution , the psf ( plotted in the lower left corner of the image ) is barely resolved on a printed page , given that the image spans 111  kpc across the diagonal .",
    "zooming in at this resolution on the central disk as in figure  [ fig : mp60zoom2fig ] finally permits appreciation of which features are resolved .",
    "jumping now to 30  ( 110  pc ) resolution on the same field in figure  [ fig : mp30zoom2fig ] begins to reveal the intricate filamentary structure of the neutral ism .",
    "point - like local minima are seen toward the most prominent background sources ( j004218 + 412926 and j004648 + 420855 ) against which absorption is detected .",
    "increasing the angular resolution to the maximum available of about 55  pc ( 18.4@xmath114.8 arcsec ) as in figure  [ fig : mp15zoom2fig ] does not appear to appreciably add detail to the filamentary structure , while increasing the noise level significantly .",
    "this is consistent with what was found by @xcite when analyzing emission data from the northeast half of the inner m31 disk ; beginning with data having 10  and 5  km  s@xmath0  resolution , spatial smoothing to 40 ",
    "resolution was required before the mean peak detected brightness decreased by 8% , while velocity smoothing to even 10  km  s@xmath0  resulted in a mean decrease of peak brightness of 15% .",
    "the major cloud complexes which are discernable in external galaxies with current instrumentation are essentially resolved with about 100  pc and 5  km  s@xmath0resolution .",
    "however , it must also be stressed that significant structure is present at even the highest angular and velocity resolution that is available .",
    "we will briefly discuss some examples in  [ sec : disc ] below .",
    "continuing on from the best signal - to - noise inner disk overview of figure  [ fig : mp30zoom2fig ] , further magnification is required to discern individual features on a printed page .",
    "the three images in figs .",
    "[ fig : mp30zoomnefig][fig : mp30zoomswfig ] give some appreciation of the wealth of detail which can be discerned in the inner disk of m31 .",
    "peak brightness is shown in the left hand panels of each figure , while velocity coherence vc@xmath25 ( defined in  [ sec : obse ] ) for the same region is shown on the right .",
    "a striking aspect of these images is the appearance of filament - like minima as well as positive morphological features , as seen in peak brightness . while positive emission features are not surprising when imaging the distribution of an external galaxy , the filamentary minima are quite novel .",
    "a further striking feature is the correspondence of high velocity coherence with the majority of these local minima .",
    "apparently the filamentary features having depressed peak brightness are often accompanied by a substantial broadening of the underlying spectral profile .",
    "this trend is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : pannefig ] and [ fig : panswfig ] ( at 30and 2.3 km  s@xmath0  resolution ) , where sequences of spectra are shown which contrast the appearance of these local minima ( central panels ) with flanking spectra which are offset perpendicular to each `` dark '' filament by only about 30 arcsec ( left and right panels ) .",
    "the locations of these cross - cuts are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mp30zoomnefig ] , [ fig : mp30zoomcfig ] and [ fig : mp30zoomswfig ] . from these spectra",
    "it is apparent that the line profiles toward such local minima in peak brightness are not only broad , but have a distinctive flat - topped appearance that is strongly suggestive of self - opacity in the emission line .",
    "the smooth curves overlaid on each spectrum are the parameterized model - fits to each spectrum that we describe in detail below in  [ subsec : glob ] .",
    "note that the rms sensitivity of these spectra , is that given in table  [ tab : sens ] of about 1  k , implying that some of the fluctuations seen toward the flat - topped peaks are quite significant .",
    "the parameterized fits are indeed consistent with a significant self - opacity of the emission within this entire system of filamentary local minima .",
    "the self - absorption ( or hisa ) phenomenon has been well - documented in the galaxy since the pioneering work of @xcite and more recently by @xcite in a large swath of the galactic plane ( 145@xmath26 ) .",
    "the physical conditions required to witness hisa are a `` sandwich '' geometry in which a cooler _ spin  _ temperature foreground gas is seen toward a higher _ brightness  _ temperature background gas at the same radial velocity .",
    "the brightness decrement of a hisa feature is proportional to this temperature difference in the absence of additional complicating factors .",
    "the simplest circumstance to imagine is a single warm , semi - opaque background feature which has a brightness temperature comparable to it s own spin temperature together with a single cooler , opaque feature in the foreground . in this simple case",
    "the hisa temperature decrement would give some information about the spin temperature of the foreground component .",
    "more complicated geometries are easily conceivable . adding a third warm , semi - opaque foreground component to make a warm - cool - warm `` sandwich '' would significantly fill - in the detected temperature decrement . clearly , the interpretation of hisa temperature decrements in physical terms is poorly constrained .",
    "the largest individual features seen in the @xcite galactic hisa sample extend over about 5@xmath27 at 2  kpc distance , and so have lengths as large as 175  pc .",
    "a subset of the galactic hisa features , such as those kinematically associated with the perseus spiral arm , are organized over tens of degrees making the complexes at least 1  kpc long .",
    "the departure from the galactic edge - on geometry to the @xmath28 inclination of m31 @xcite means that the necessary alignment conditions for witnessing hisa are essentially eliminated on large scales in m31 . instead",
    ", the `` sandwich '' geometry that can yield large - scale hisa features in the galaxy would be projected into spatially resolved , parallel `` slices '' of semi - opaque gas of different spin temperature .",
    "we identify the filamentary local minima in peak brightness seen in m31 with the colder opaque features that are responsible for large - scale hisa in the galaxy .",
    "we use the term `` self - opaque '' to emphasis the importance of internal optical depth effects in determining the profile shapes of these features , as distinct from `` self - absorption '' which implies a substantial temperature contrast of features that overlap both along the line - of - sight and in radial velocity .    by comparison to the kpc extent of galactic hisa complexes , the self - opaque filamentary minima in m31 ( for example the one running from ( @xmath29 ( 00:45:25,+41:36 ) to ( 00:45:55,+41:50 ) in fig.[fig : mp30zoomnefig ] ) are often in excess of 10  arcmin in length corresponding to more than 2  kpc .",
    "one such linear feature is seen to cross very near the line - of - sight to the background continuum source j004218 + 412926 ( = b0039 + 412 ) , as seen in fig.[fig : mp30zoomcfig ] .",
    "absorption measurements for this source and several others have been published previously in @xcite .",
    "we will comment further on these sources below .",
    "more complex local minima of all sizes can be seen in the m31 data wherever sufficient local intensity is present in both position and velocity .",
    "in contrast , the filamentary network of systematically broadened profiles ( traced by the velocity coherence ) are even more ubiquitous , since profile broadening can be detected independent of the emission characteristics of the surroundings .",
    "a subset of galactic hisa features is closely associated with molecular clouds as traced by oh and co emission ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , while the majority have no apparent co counterparts @xcite .",
    "the conjecture has been made ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) that those hisa features _ without  _ associated co detections may represent an earlier evolutionary phase in molecular cloud formation and that such features may be organized over kpc - scale regions by the passage of spiral density wave ( or other forms of ) shocks .",
    "only after subsequent cooling and compression would complex molecule and star  formation proceed .",
    "some of the most dramatic self - opaque features discernible in the m31 peak brightness images appear to lie on the leading edges of spiral arm structures , for example the feature extending from ( @xmath29(00:45:25,+41:36 ) to ( 00:45:55,+41:50 ) .",
    "( we can deduce the upstream edge of bright features from the counter - clockwise sense of rotation that follows from the approaching major axis pa  =  232@xmath27 east of north and the near - side minor axis pa",
    "=  322@xmath27 ) .",
    "this appears to be quite a general phenomenon ; discernible as a sharp local minimum in peak along the leading edge of essentially every arm segment with a suitably bright background .",
    "comparison of the peak brightness with the integrated co(1 - 0 ) observed with the iram 30 m at 23 arcsec resolution @xcite in figs .",
    "[ fig : mp30cone][fig : mp30cosw ] suggests a rather good correlation of the peak brightness of with integrated co at this resolution of about 100  pc at radii less than about 12  kpc ; with a distinct decline of associated co to larger radii .",
    "in contrast , the filamentary self - opaque minima , particularly those associated with the leading edges of spiral features , have only very patchy correspondence with co(1 - 0 ) features , even near 12  kpc .",
    "while some indications for self - opacity in the line are indicated by qualitative features , like flat - topped spectral profiles , obtaining quantitative estimates of the `` hidden '' mass in neutral hydrogen is considerably more challenging .",
    "the `` classical '' method of opacity correction ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) has consisted of calculating the column density from : @xmath30 where a single cool component spin temperature , t@xmath31 , is assumed to apply for all spectra .",
    "the relevant spin temperature has been chosen to be similar to the highest brightness temperature actually observed , for example t@xmath31  =  125  k for the galaxy @xcite , or has been estimated from a fit to the relation between observed absorption opacity and the emission brightness , t@xmath31  =  175  k for m31 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "a single spin temperature is assumed to apply throughout the galaxy in question , which is clearly a poor assumption , and the highest observed brightnesses ( those with @xmath32 ) have an undefined column density .    rather than assuming that a single spin temperature might be appropriate for an entire galaxy ,",
    "let us consider a more realistic scenario in which the major atomic clouds in a galactic disk are approximately isothermal on scales of 100  pc .",
    "from @xcite we have an estimate of the face - on surface covering factor of such features within the star forming disk in a sample of nearby galaxies of about 15% .",
    "this implies that even at the moderately high inclination of m31 , of 78@xmath27 , we are unlikely to have more than a single major cloud along any line - of - sight in the absence of strong warping .",
    "( even in the strongly warped case , there need not be widespread velocity overlap of these components . ) in addition , the good correlation between absorption opacity and the emission brightness @xcite in both the galaxy and m31 suggest that the contribution of warm ( 5000  10@xmath33  k ) , optically thin gas in the extended environment of major clouds to the emission brightness is only a few kelvin , although distributed over the relevant line - width of some 10 s of km  s@xmath0 .",
    "these considerations suggest that detailed modeling of the peak ( and not the wings ) of an emission profile as an isothermal cloud may provide a useful estimate of the underlying physical parameters , provided the physical and velocity resolution is sufficiently high ( about 100  pc and 2  km  s@xmath0 ) and the galaxy is viewed at an inclination of less than about 81@xmath27 .",
    "such an approach has been considered previously by @xcite , who have documented the precision and expected biases that might pertain to parameter estimation as a function of the peak signal - to - noise for an _ unblended , _",
    "isothermal cloud .",
    "we will return to the question of the expected uncertainties in such an approach below .",
    "the line profile due to a spatially resolved _",
    "isothermal  _ feature in the _ presence of turbulent broadening  _ can be written as @xmath34\\ } \\label{eqn : tb}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 where the velocity dispersion , @xmath15 , has units of km  s@xmath0  and is the quadratic sum of an assumed thermal and nonthermal contribution @xmath36 with the thermal contribution given by @xmath37 , for a kinetic temperature , @xmath38 . while such profiles have a gaussian shape for low ratios of the column density ( in units of cm@xmath3 ) to spin temperature , @xmath39 they become increasingly flat - topped when this ratio becomes high .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the spin and kinetic temperatures are equal , @xmath40 , which should apply to regions of moderate volume density although not in general , cf . @xcite .",

    "some indication for the relevance of the fit results can be obtained by comparison with high signal - to - noise observations of absorption toward background continuum sources . as noted previously , several bright background continuum sources that have been studied by @xcite fall fortuitously near regions of significant self - opacity , particularly the sources b0039 + 412 and b0044 + 419 for which peak optical depths of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are observed .",

    "the unprecented physical sensitivity obtained for m31 allows us to track the atomic gas properties out to more than three times larger radii .",
    "the apparent column density distribution in panel  b follows a similar trend , illustrating the exponential character of both the increase to- and the subsequent decline from- the peak near 12  kpc . a 6  kpc scale - length exponential function is overlaid on the plots in panels b , c , d and h to illustrate how well this scale - length describes the gas mass density .",
    "intriguingly , the old stellar population of m31 , as traced by 3.6 @xmath65 m spitzer imaging between 1 and 12  kpc radius is best - fit with a 6.08@xmath660.09  kpc scale - length exponential @xcite .",
    "the corrected column density , shown in panel  c , has a median ridge - line that closely tracks the apparent column , but also demonstrates that outliers to higher corrected column occur primarily at radii between about 7 and 30  kpc . adding in the molecular contribution to mass surface density ( as described in detail in ",
    "[ subsec : sfrd ] ) in panel  d yields only minor changes to the radial trend of the atomic column density .",
    "the most significant is a slight addition of mass density near 12  kpc , where the molecular contribution permits the total to better track the 6  kpc exponential to slightly smaller radii . inside of about 12  kpc is a sharp cut - off that can be described with a 3  kpc exponential scale - length . beyond about 28  kpc , where opaque is no longer found ,",
    "there is a significant truncation of the disk exponential ( neutral ) mass density , corresponding to a 2  kpc scale - length .",
    "the corresponding face - on column density ( scaled by 1/cos(78@xmath27 ) ) where this outer truncation sets in , is 5@xmath67cm@xmath3 .    the radial distribution of velocity coherence ( panel  e ) shows a similar trend , rising rapidly out to about 10  kpc , then declining out to about 30  kpc and then plummeting .",
    "both the derived non - thermal velocity dispersion ( panel  f ) and spin temperature ( panel  g ) show some broad systematic decline with radius beyond 10  kpc .",
    "for the spin temperature , it is only the lower envelope of the distribution which represents `` opaque '' fits .",
    "these `` opaque '' cool component temperatures are as low as 20  k near 7 and 25  kpc , but increase to about 60  k near 10  kpc .",
    "this is quite distinct from the most highly populated ridge - line , which represents predominantly `` transparent '' lines - of - sight .",
    "the ridge - line shows a similar trend , but is offset to higher temperatures by about an order of magnitude .",
    "current massive sfr density ( as defined below in   [ subsec : sfrd ] ) is shown in panel  h. the apparent nuclear peak in sfr density is due to other processes ( as discussed below ) , while current coverage only extends to about 20  kpc .",
    "current sfr density is highly peaked near 12  kpc , where gas mass densities are highest and does not track the 6  kpc exponential of the median gass mass density .",
    "a particular form of correlation of observable parameters deserves special consideration , namely that between the surface density of gas mass and the star formation rate .",
    "many authors have addressed the relationship between these properties on both a global and local level , beginning with the pioneering study of @xcite and most recently by @xcite and @xcite , who probe the resolved relationship of these parameters down to scales of 500  pc within ngc  5194 ( m51a ) and 400  pc within ngc  7331 respectively .",
    "given the proximity of m31 we can extend this work by more than an order of magnitude to smaller surface area at spatial scales of 100  pc , albeit with a substantial inclination correction that introduces some potential linear smearing ( by a factor of 4.8 ) in one dimension .",
    "mass and star formation rates have been calculated after background subtraction and spatial smoothing of all relevant images to the same 30  arcsec ( 113  pc ) gaussian resolution as applies to the properties .",
    "the mass surface density was calculated from the integrated co(10 ) emission observed with the iram telescope by @xcite assuming a mean atomic mass of 1.36 m@xmath68 and an n@xmath69/i@xmath70 conversion factor of 2.8@xmath71cm@xmath3/k - km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this differs from the procedure adopted by @xcite , ( hereafter k07 ) who keep the comparison in terms of hydrogen nuclei ( rather than including a helium mass correction ) .",

    "radii beyond about 1520  kpc therefore only have an contribution to the calculated mass density .",

    "the term `` bolometric '' in this context is a misnomer , since the quantity is not assumed to represent a true integral of the entire sed , but merely to provide sensitivity to both directly emitted uv and re - radiated ir light .",
    "the value of @xmath73 , which represents the fraction of the ir luminosity due to an older stellar population , is expected to vary substantially with environment within a galaxy .",
    "ideally , this would also be modeled in a position dependent way , but that is beyond the scope of the current discussion .",

    "the gas depletion time - scale of the plotted line is 1  gyr ( for a n@xmath69/i@xmath70 conversion factor of 2@xmath77cm@xmath3/k - km  s@xmath0  as assumed by wong & blitz ) .",
    "this is similar to many of the galaxies analyzed in wb02 , although occurring at mass and star formation densities that are at least an order of magnitude lower within m31 .",
    "the m51a molecular - only relation of k07 is both steeper and shifted to higher mass densities by at least 0.3 dex .",
    "the total - gas mass density plots are over - plotted with the relation fit by k07 to the m51a data with slope 1.56 .",
    "note that we have plotted star formation rate density in units of m@xmath2pc@xmath3gyr@xmath0 rather than the m@xmath2kpc@xmath3yr@xmath0 of k07 implying a shift of 3 dex .",
    "the different units of both axes ( relative to k07 ) have been taken into account for the overplotted curves .",
    "remarkably , the m51a relation provides a very good fit to the m31 data , despite the fact that it has been derived in the strongly molecular - dominated inner disk of m51 and is being applied thoughout the atomic - dominated disk of m31 .",
    "the highest contours of correlation probability are about twice as narrow for the total - gas relation compared to the molecular - only one . in the relation using apparent , there is a very steep truncation to mass densities exceeding about 10  m@xmath2pc@xmath3 , together with a saturation that sets in near 16  m@xmath2pc@xmath3 .",
    "this truncation disappears in the opacity - corrected relation , together with a small shift of the peak correlation ridge - line to higher mass densities .",

    "the enhanced 24@xmath65 m emission from the nuclear regions of m31 is accompanied by both recombination- and forbidden emission line gas ( as first documented by @xcite ) with line ratios suggestive of shock heating , and as such is not due to massive star formation .",
    "essentially no co is detected from the nuclear region , so this feature is not apparent in panels a and d. beyond about 5  kpc , the same basic correlation is seen to apply at all radii , with only the range of the observables showing some systematic variation , but not the basic ridge - line of their correlation .",
    "the sharp truncation of the molecular - only mass density near 1  m@xmath2pc@xmath3 is a consequence of the limited sensitivity .",
    "the same is true for star formation rate densities below about 0.2  m@xmath2pc@xmath3gyr@xmath0 .    at star formation rate densities below about 0.4  m@xmath2pc@xmath3gyr@xmath0 and total gas surface densities of about 5  m@xmath2pc@xmath3",

    "this may indeed be a distinct threshold for the formation of molecular clouds from which stars will form .",
    "the most substantial contribution to this possible threshold comes from radii in excess of 15  kpc .    perhaps the most surprising aspect of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrfig ] is the good statistical correlation of total gas mass and star formation density down to spatial scales of about 100  pc and gas masses of only 5@xmath79  m@xmath2 , well inside the regime of individual , giant molecular clouds .",

    "we suggest that such features are the counterpart of large - scale self - absorption ( hisa ) features seen in the galaxy .",

    "such a geometry leads to widespread hisa in the edge - on galactic disk , but is spatially resolved into distinct parallel filaments in the inclined disk of m31 .",

    "<S> we have undertaken a deep , wide - field imaging survey of m31 , reaching a maximum resolution of about 50  pc and 2  km  s@xmath0  across a 95@xmath148  kpc region . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and brightness sensitivity at 100  pc resolution for a 25  km  s@xmath0  wide spectral feature is 1500  m@xmath2 and 0.28  k. our study reveals ubiquitous self - opacity features , discernible in the first instance as filamentary local minima in images of the peak brightness temperature . </S>",
    "<S> local minima are organized into complexes of more than kpc length and are particularly associated with the leading edge of spiral arm features . </S>",
    "<S> just as in the galaxy , there is only patchy correspondence of self - opaque features with co(1 - 0 ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> we have produced images of the best - fit physical parameters ; spin temperature , opacity - corrected column density and non - thermal velocity dispersion , for the brightest spectral feature along each line - of - sight in the m31 disk . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopically opaque atomic gas is organized into filamentary complexes and isolated clouds down to 100  pc . </S>",
    "<S> localized opacity corrections to the column density exceed an order of magnitude in many cases and add globally to a 30% increase in the atomic gas mass over that inferred from the integrated brightness under the usual assumption of negligible self - opacity . </S>",
    "<S> opaque atomic gas first increases from 20 to 60  k in spin temperature with radius to 12  kpc but then declines again to 20  k beyond 25  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the resolved star formation law down to physical scales more than an order of magnitude smaller in area and mass than has been possible previously . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between total - gas - mass- and star - formation - rate - density is significantly tighter than that with molecular - mass and is fully consistent _ in both slope and normalization  _ with the power law index of 1.56 found in the molecule - dominated disk of m51 at 500  pc resolution . below a gas - mass - density of about 5 m@xmath2pc@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a down - turn in star - formation - rate - density which may represent a real local threshold for massive star formation at a cloud mass of about 5@xmath4  m@xmath2 . </S>"
