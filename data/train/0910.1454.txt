    "<S> a simple sufficient condition on curved end of a straight cylinder is found that provides a localization of the principal eigenfunction of the mixed boundary value for the laplace operator with the dirichlet conditions on the lateral side . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the eigenfunction concentrates in the vicinity of the ends and decays exponentially in the interior . </S>",
