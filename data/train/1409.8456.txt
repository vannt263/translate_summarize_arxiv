    "polymer translocation has in less that 20 years become one of the most active research areas in soft matter biological physics . since the initial experimental work of kasianowicz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on rna translocation through @xmath6-hemolysin channels , the interest in the potential technological applications such as gene therapy , drug delivery and rapid dna sequencing has motivated a steady flow of experimental and theoretical research  .",
    "of particular interest is the case of the pore - driven polymer translocation , where the segment of the polymer inside the pore is driven by an electric field . unlike the case of unbiased translocation , where the polymer supposedly has enough time to equilibrate in some limits @xcite the driven translocation problem is inherently a far - from - equilibrium process  @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", significant advance has been made in the theoretical basis of driven polymer translocation .",
    "it is now understood that the dynamics of driven translocation is dominated by the drag of the _ cis _ side chain , with leading order corrections stemming from the friction of the pore  @xcite , with the _ trans _ side suspected to have only a minor effect on the whole process  @xcite . to evaluate the contribution from the _ cis _ side drag",
    ", one must study the non - equilibrium time evolution of the chain configurations .",
    "the basic picture is that of two domains , with the chain divided into mobile and immobile parts , where only the segments belonging into the mobile part contribute to the drag . in the simplest description",
    ", the process can be viewed as a sequential straightening of loops , where the loops between a given segment and the pore need to be pulled straight before the segment can experience the force and become mobile  @xcite .",
    "based on this picture , the scaling form @xmath7 for the average translocation time @xmath0 as a function of chain length @xmath2 can be derived with scaling arguments  @xcite , giving @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants . here",
    "the first term is due to the _ cis _ side drag and contains the flory exponent @xmath3 that characterizes the initial shape of the chain , given by the end - to - end distance @xmath11 .",
    "the latter term is due to the interaction of the pore and the polymer , the strength of which is given by the effective pore friction @xmath12 .",
    "thermal fluctuations from the solvent introduce both undulations to the shape of the chain and randomness into the effective driving force . using blob theory , it is possible to describe the shape of the mobile part and the propagation of the boundary between the mobile and immobile parts self - consistently  .",
    "asymptotic analysis of this _ tension propagation _",
    "theory also gives the long chain limit of the translocation time as @xmath13 , similar to the simple scaling arguments  @xcite .",
    "numerical analysis has shown that the finite chain length effects due to the pore friction persist for extremely long chains , and that they are responsible for the scatter in the reported values of the scaling exponent @xmath6  @xcite .    with numerical methods ,",
    "one may also consider the effect of thermal fluctuations to the driving force .",
    "previous results indicate that the randomness of the effective force alone is insufficient to explain the fluctuations observed in molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "saito and sakaue have proposed that for large driving forces the uncertainty in the initial configurations would determine the distribution of the translocation time  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our main aim is to investigate the influence of the uncertainty in the initial chain configuration to translocation dynamics by introducing stochasticity to the initial chain configuration at the _ cis _ side .",
    "this is based on using the brownian dynamics - tension propagation ( bdtp ) framework introduced in refs .",
    "we modify this approach by deriving the tension propagation ( tp ) equations by assuming a constant monomer flux on the mobile part of the chain in the _ cis _ side .",
    "this formalism leads to an explicit equation of motion for the velocity of the tension front and eliminates the need of the original bdtp model to include an approximate initial velocity profile to ensure the conservation mass .",
    "in addition , the model allows us to derive a finite - size scaling form for the average translocation time , which is in agreement with ansatz of ref .",

    "@xcite . adding the fluctuations to the driving force",
