    "the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ; @xcite ) is a wide but shallow x - ray survey of two strips above and below the bulge .",
    "the design of the survey calls for two regions of galactic longitude @xmath0 , and latitude @xmath1 .",
    "three quarters of the area was imaged by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis - i camera with exposures of at least 2ks and a detection flux limit of @xmath2erg@xmath3s@xmath4 from 20072009 , with the remaining area being observed in fall 2011 and spring 2012 .",
    "this has resulted in the detection of 1234 x - ray sources from the 20072009 observations @xcite and an additional 424 objects from 20112012 ( jonker et al . , in preparation ) . by design",
    ", the survey avoids the most crowded and absorbed regions of the galactic plane and so many of these sources have unique candidate optical counterparts .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy and multi - epoch photometry is finding a high fraction of sources with spectroscopic peculiarities and/or photometric variability that appear to be true counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "most sources are expected to be galactic in origin , although about some background active galactic nuclei are present in the sample @xcite .    among the optical counterparts ,",
    "a fraction correspond to very bright , often nearby stars , and these can be expected to be dominated by detections of ` normal ' stars . this paper reports on the properties of those gbs objects coincident with stars in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite . as such ,",
    "it is limited to optical counterparts brighter than 12th magnitude .",
    "many of these stars also appear in the henry draper catalogs @xcite and so have spectral classifications .",
    "while our main interest is to find any abnormal objects among the sample , by matching of our predominantly faint x - ray sources with bright optical counterparts we are naturally selecting for objects with rather low x - ray to optical flux ratios , and will thus expect to mainly exclude exotica like x - ray binaries .    while there were isolated early detections of stellar x - rays , the _ einstein _",
    "satellite really opened to door to systematic studies of stellar x - ray emission , and revealed that across the hertzsprung - russell diagram x - ray sources are the rule , rather than the exception @xcite .",
    "as the sensitivity of x - ray telescopes has improved , more and more stars have been added to x - ray catalogs , consequently filling in the region of parameter space occupied by the lowest x - ray luminosity stars . in some cases",
    "this is through deliberate surveys , and sometimes as serendipitous detections .",
    "a comprehensive review of stellar x - ray astronomy is provided by @xcite and references therein .    among early - type ob stars ,",
    "the standard paradigm is that x - rays arise from shocks within their strong winds at quite large radii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "empirically , the relation @xmath5 is found in o  b1 stars @xcite , supporting a strong coupling between the radiatively driven winds and the x - ray generation .",
    "many details of the mechanism remain unclear , and the high spectral resolution studies possible with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have raised challenges to the standard paradigm ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectra from these objects are typically very soft , peaking below @xmath6kev",
    ". they can usually be well fit by between one and three thermal plasma components ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in reasonably close ob binaries",
    ", it is possible to also develop x - rays from the shock where their winds interact , leading to the class of over - luminous colliding wind binaries @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of x - ray production from winds drops substantially among b stars , with @xmath7 decreasing from @xmath8 for the most x - ray luminous b0 stars to @xmath9@xmath10 for spectral types later than b2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that in the young open cluster ngc6231 less than 20%  of mid to late b stars were detected in x - rays , and those that were had harder spectra than the o stars , and were sometimes seen to flare .",
    "they suggested that the x - rays actually originate from pre - main - sequence companions , for which the hard spectra and flaring are quite typical .",
    "the be stars form an important sub - class of b stars @xcite . in these rapidly rotating stars an equatorial excretion disk develops .",
    "these objects can be intrinsic x - ray emitters in their own right , with typical be stars in the sample of @xcite showing x - ray luminosities about three times higher than comparable normal b stars . more dramatically , when be star systems play host to neutron stars , more luminous x - rays from the interaction between the compact object and the circumstellar material can be seen , typically in periodic outbursts @xcite .",
    "recently a class of intermediate luminosity objects , the @xmath11  cas analogs , have been identified @xcite including , it turns out , one of our sample , hd161103 @xcite .",
    "these objects show much harder x - ray spectra than typical ob or be stars , and short timescale x - ray variability .",
    "their nature remains unclear ; they could be unusual single be stars , or counterparts to the be x - ray binaries containing white dwarfs instead of neutron stars .",
    "x - ray emission from solar- and late - type main sequence stars is ubiquitous and originates from a magnetically confined plasma at a temperature of several million kelvin known as a corona @xcite .",
    "the corona is powered by a dynamo , which itself is generated by a combination of rotation and convection within the convective envelope . a strong correlation between rotation and stellar x - ray activity",
    "was first noted by @xcite and has since been quantified in detail ( e.g.  @xcite ) , providing strong support for the dynamo - induced nature of stellar activity .",
    "as stars spin down as they age ( e.g. @xcite ) , the dynamo weakens and x - ray activity reduces from the high levels seen in young stars ( @xmath12 , e.g.  @xcite ) to the levels typically seen in the sun and old field stars ( @xmath13 , e.g.  @xcite ) . generally late - type evolved stars are weak x - ray emitters .",
    "exceptions can be expected to be unusually rapidly rotating single stars , of which the fk  com stars present the most extreme example , or forced into rapid rotation in close binaries such as rs  cvn systems .",
    "a comprehensive review of x - ray emission from stellar coronae is provided by @xcite .    in fully radiative stars ( earlier than mid f - type )",
    "the dynamo mechanism breaks down and x - ray emission becomes very weak .",
    "vega , for example , remains undetected as an x - ray source , with a _",
    "chandra _ upper limit to its luminosity of @xmath14ergs@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "x - ray detections of late b and a stars are then quite unexpected , and in most cases the origin of the x - rays will be a later type companion star .",
    "more generally , the overarching scientific interest of the gbs is to extend our knowledge of binaries , and binary evolution , and as discussed above , we would expect many of the x - ray brightest objects in our sample to be binaries in some form .",
    "rs  cvn systems have already been mentioned . by  dra systems",
    "are similar , containing main - sequence stars .",
    "algols , too are typically seen as x - ray emitters , with the x - rays originating from the cooler star in the binary .",
    "the most extreme close binaries , contact w  uma systems , are also expected to have strong coronal x - ray emission .",
    "the algols illustrate an important point . here , it is commonly the hotter component that is seen in the optical spectrum , but the cool component that gives rise to coronal x - rays .",
    "generally , we can not always assume that the optically brightest star is the x - ray source .",
    "the goals of this paper are to summarize the matches between the gbs and tycho-2 stars , to discuss their properties and attempt to classify each object , to examine if any of these stars show anomalous x - ray emission for their spectral type , and ultimately to either identify objects containing compact companions or eliminate these objects from our sample as candidate interacting binaries .",
    "we begin by discussing the catalogs and matching criteria used in section  [ matchsection ] . to classify the sources we then examine x - ray to optical flux ratios ( section  [ ratiosection ] ) , optical / infrared color - color diagrams ( section  [ colorcolorsection ] ) , and x - ray hardness ratios ( section  [ hardnesssection ] ) .",
    "we draw this , and other available information together for individual sources in section  [ sourcesection ] , and finally discuss the classes of objects found in section  [ discussionsection ] and summarize our findings in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "our starting point is the x - ray source lists from the gbs . we merge the published list , which we will refer to as the northern sample @xcite with additional sources detected in the final southern strip of the survey , the southern sample ( jonker et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "for ease of recognition we will use abbreviated source names of cxnnnn for sources from the northern sample , and cxbnnnn for sources in the southern sample . besides being more compact ,",
    "this notation has the advantage that each list is sorted in order of x - ray brightness , so the cx number conveys information that is absent from the longer positional names such as cxogbs  j175024.4290216 .    in performing our optical matches , we identified two cases where two of the x - ray sources appear to coincide with the same tycho star . in both cases ,",
    "the two x - ray sources were detected in different images , and one has a much larger off - axis angle than the other , and consequently less precise coordinates . in these cases",
    "we believe that they are duplicate detections of the same source , with position differences just too large for @xcite to have identified them as duplicates .",
    "the redundant sources are cx191 , which appears to have been an off - axis detection of cx360 , and cx230 , which appears to be an off - axis detection of cx33 .",
    "another similar case has been found with the optically fainter catalysmic variable candiate cx93 , for which cx153 appears to be an off - axis detection ( ratti et al .  in preparation ) . on examination of the gbs source catalog",
    ", we identified a further fifteen likely duplications which share the characteristics of being from different chandra observation ids and having one or both detection at sizeable off - axis angle .",
    "these are : cx16 = cx515 , cx38 = cx225 , cx61 = cx136 , cx175 = cx464 , cx177 = cx384 , cx345 = cx233 , cx270 = cx571 , cx597 = cx273 , cx280 = cx382 , cx394 = cx285 , cx292 = cx323 , cx304 = cx303 , cx1155 = cx483 , cx636 = cx635 , and cx646 = cx851 . in each case",
    ", we have listed the detection with smallest off - axis angle first , so the second source of each pair can be considered the duplicate . in most cases ,",
    "the detection closer to the axis is also the stronger one .",
    "a few more cases were found where close objects appear to be detected in the same observation i d , and we believe these are distinct x - ray sources .",
    "cx916 and cx917 are one such pair that match an optical double , hd316666a and b. we removed all eighteen of the apparent duplicate objects from the catalog leaving 1216 unique sources in the northern sample .    following this experience",
    ", we were careful to check the southern sample for repeat detections of objects from the northern sample , and for duplicates . as a result ,",
    "the southern sample includes 424 new and unique x - ray sources with no credible duplications .",
    "after duplicate removal , our combined catalogs total 1640 unique sources .",
    "all statistics reported here on numbers of matches expected and found are based on this combined unique subset of the full source lists .",
    "we primarily consider matches with the tycho-2 astrometric catalog @xcite .",
    "this provides a reasonably uniform catalog of the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky , with excellent positions and lower quality , although still useful , two color photometry .",
    "we also check for matches with the original henry draper catalog @xcite , the henry draper catalog extension @xcite , and the henry draper extension charts ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) as these provide spectroscopic classifications for many of the matches found in the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "we consider a candidate match to be an x - ray source within 10arcsec of a tycho-2 star to allow for the large uncertainties in _ chandra _ positions for large off - axis angles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "proper motions are applied to the tycho-2 stars pair - by - pair to obtain the correct optical coordinates corresponding to the epoch of each chandra observation .",
    "the proper motions between the j2000 reference epoch of the tycho-2 catalog , and the 20062012 chandra observations are mostly small compared to the chandra positional uncertainty , but not always , with the largest accumulated proper motion ( for cxb93 , a nearby m dwarf ) being 3.3arcsec .",

    "it is clear that few can be expected to be coincidences .",
    "statistically we would expect @xmath152 chance coincidences within 10arcsec , a 20% chance of finding one match within 2arcsec , and a 5%  chance of finding one within 1arcsec .",
    "given these statistics it seems likely that a few of the matches with offsets of 27arcsec are due to chance coincidence , but most are probably not . in some cases",
    "the match may be with a resolved binary companion rather than to the tycho-2 star itself .",
    "those sources observed by chandra at small off - axis angles with good detections are most suspect .",
    "we can assess the likelihood of a chance match on a case - by - case basis using the results of @xcite who present 95%  confidence radii as a function of off - axis angle and number of counts .",
    "of the offsets greater than 2arcsec , cx917 can immediately be excluded as this corresponds to the resolved companion hd316666b , and the large offset comes from matching it with hd316666a .",
    "we find that the offsets for cx728 , cx925 , cxb211 , and cxb225 are not significant at the 95%  confidence level so these may be true counterparts to the x - ray source observed at large off - axis angles .",
    "for the remainder of the objects with offsets greater than 2arcsec , in every case the offset is at least twice the 95%  confidence ranges so these nine objects ( cx53 , 59 , 77 , 156 , 360 , 388 , 622 , and cxb17 , and 296 ) are either matches with resolved binary companions or true coincidences .",
    "we also checked the ten objects with offsets between 1 and 2arcsec by the same criteria .",
    "all of these objects were observed at greater than 5arcmin off - axis angle , and none of the offsets seen are significant at the 95%  confidence level , so we believe these are all true matches , as was expected statistically .",

    "the gbs is working with the superior ir data from the vista variables in the via lactea project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vvv ) , for the objects considered here , vvv photometry is expected to be saturated and so 2mass is generally more reliable .      finally we checked each matched tycho-2 star against the all sky automated survey ( asas ) catalog of variable stars @xcite .",

    "we were not able to confirm the putative variability in either cxb287 , or cxb422 using the asas data .",

    "all of our tycho-2 stars were included in the asas photometry database , although the brightest are saturated and unusable .",
    "cx205 is by far the worst case at magnitude 6.7 .",
    "cx156 , cx183 , cx256 , cx275 , and cx863 all suffer from mild saturation but we can still exclude large amplitude variability in these objects .",
    "we initially used the standard deviation of the lightcurves to quantify the variability ( considering only a grade photometry ) , but found that there were several objects showing large standard deviations caused by a small number of points with large excursions several magnitudes below the typical values .",
    "many stars show these excursions , even well understood objects such as a the w  uma system v3892  sgr ( cx352 ) , so we believe they are spurious .",

    "four apparently normal ob stars , and two be stars were found in our sample , all with very close matches between x - ray and optical positions . in addition , a third x - ray source ( cxb296 ) was found near a be star , but too far away to be a credible x - ray counterpart to it .",
    "there is every reason to believe the other six early type stars are all true optical counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "two of the ob stars cx31 and cxb8 have late - o spectral classes .",
    "they have quite high @xmath330 ratios , but still plausible for single , normal ob stars . both have optical / ir colors consistent with normal stars ,",
    "although cxb8 does have a mid - ir excess and appears to be a young object .",
    "cx31 has a rather hard x - ray spectrum ( by the standards of our sample ) , but this is at least in part due to a higher @xmath386 than the other ob stars in the sample , judging by its @xmath212 color .",
    "it remains possible that it is a more unusual object such as a colliding wind binary or low - luminosity x - ray binary .",
    "cx863 and cxb306 are slightly later in spectral class , early - b .",
    "their @xmath330 ratios are lower , and quite typical of ob stars .",
    "cxb306 has normal stellar colors .",
    "cx863 may have slightly redder colors than a single star , but this only marginally significant    one of the gbs predictions was that @xmath387 be x - ray binaries would be identified @xcite .",
    "none have been found in the ( nearby ) tycho-2 sample , but the sources predicted were expected to be further away and subject to more reddening , and so would not be expected to have tycho-2 counterparts . instead , the two be stars we have found are fainter in x - rays .",
    "one , cx6 , is an intermediate luminosity @xmath11  cas system , possibly harboring a white dwarf .",
    "the other , cx33 , is most likely a normal , single be star .      ; see that figure for further explanation .",
    ", width=345 ]    there are a surprising number of a stars in our sample .",
    "to some extent , this is a selection effect since our tycho-2 sample is effectively an optical flux - limited sample and so has a larger sample volume for earlier spectral types . in most cases ,",
    "as expected , there is evidence from ir colors and/or variability for a companion star , usually inferred to be larger in radius than the a star .",
    "figure  [ astarcolorcolorfig ] shows just the spectroscopically confirmed late b and a stars from figure  [ colorcolorfig ] .",
    "we show the b3a7 main - sequence , together with two sets of loops , one corresonding to main - sequence companions of a range of spectral types , the other to more luminous companions .",
    "we see that the sources appear to divide into three groups .",
    "neither of the two b9 stars , cx514 and cxb211 show evidence for an ir excess , although a main - sequence companion can not be ruled out .",
    "cx183 , cx506 , cxb116 , cxb233 , and cxb287 all show weak excesses , suggesting main - sequence or mildly evolved companions .",
    "finally cx9 , cx115 , cx333 , cx337 , and cxb181 all require luminous companions @xmath388mags above the main sequence .",
    "the preponderance of evolved companions is not expected , since later type companions should not have had time to evolve off of the main - sequence .",
    "it could arise in two ways .",
    "first , where a large difference in spectral types is seen , it is possible that the later - type star is still a very active pre - main - sequence star , and so is larger than it will eventually be . secondly , an a star plus a late - type sub - giant or giant could be a typical algol system",
    ".    cx115 is , indeed , a known eclipsing algol .",
    "cx9 is also eclipsing and we propose that it is a new algol candidate , and possibly a mass - transferring system .",
    "cx333 appears to show ellipsoidal variations suggesting a close , late - type companion in a 30day period .",
    "it may be a long - period algol .",
    "for the remainder of the sources , although a late - type companion is implied , there is no evidence that it is close .",
    "we attempt to distinguish active late - type stars ( i.e.  fgkm stars with very strong coronal emission ) from those showing more normal coronal emission .",
    "criteria for ` activity ' include a high x - ray to optical flux ratio , hard x - ray spectra , or irregular variability .",
    "the presence of radio emission would be a very powerful diagnostic as magnetically active stars usually follow the gdel - benz relation , whereas inactive stars are much weaker in the radio , while retaining significant x - ray emission ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite looked for radio counterparts to gbs x - ray sources using the nvss catalog @xcite .",
    "12 matches were found with the original cx sources of @xcite , but none correspond to objects in this paper .",
    "neither are any of the cxb sources in this paper detected by the nvss .",
    "unfortunately , while the nvss is the deepest radio survey covering the whole gbs area , it is not sensitive enough to detect radio emission from these objects , as the gdel - benz relation would predict that all of the sources considered in this paper would fall well below the 2.5mjy sensitivity of the nvss .    among the late - type stars , cx7 stands out .",
    "this is at or near coronal saturation and appears to be a very young k dwarf .",
    "cx352 is also distinguished by being the only w  uma contact binary in the sample .",
    "a few other stars show signs of strong activity .",
    "cx4 is a very active giant .",
    "cx10 and 12 , and cxb5 are all active g or k stars with no luminosity class , showing high @xmath330 , quite hard x - ray spectra , and irregular variability .",
    "cx12 , at least , appears to have a later type companion as well .",
    "finally we note two somewhat unusual f stars , both with moderately high @xmath330 .",
    "cx72 exhibited an unclassified outburst , with no other peculiarities .",
    "cx296 is unusual in its lack of peculiarities since f0 stars typically have quite weak x - ray emission ; indeed , in figure  [ sptratiofig ] it appears somewhat isolated , and lies an order of magnitude above other stars of the same spectral type .",
    "many of the late - type stars show no signs of strong activity ; modest @xmath389 , and no variability .",
    "these include two giants , cx256 and cx632 , and several dwarfs , cx26 , cx205 , cx275 , and cx785 .",
    "the remainder , cx91 , cx402 , cx485 , cx916 , and cxb422 , have no luminosity classifications .",
    "our sample only included one tycho-2 m dwarf , cxb93 , together with its binary companion cxb36 which is not in the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "since the sample is selected by optical brightness , this is not surprising .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these two stars are unremarkable , and if anything unusually low .      after checking for known",
    "doubles , a few apparently single tycho-2 stars are significantly offset from the nearby _ chandra _ source , and these remain as probable chance alignments .",
    "these are cx59 , cx156 , cx360 , cx388 , cx622 , cxb17 , and cxb296 .",
    "cxb296 is a particularly interesting case since it appears to lie near a be star , yet that star rather securely is not the detected x - ray source . in addition , cx77 seems likely to not be associated with either hd157571 or the star close to it , bringing us to a total of eight likely coincidences .",
    "there are additionally a few objects for which a real match could not be ruled out at the 95%  confidence level , but which may nonetheless be close coincidences .",
    "we estimated in section  [ coincidencesection ] that there should be about 5 true coincidences in our sample .",
    "while finding 8 is not a substantial excess , with the high incidence of binarity among field stars , it is likely that some of these could be undetected resolved binary companions .",
    "we have examined the properties of 69 stars from the galactic bulge survey ( @xcite , jonker et al . in preparation ) which match with tycho-2 stars .",
    "all have quite low @xmath390 ratios in the range @xmath391 , and can be adequately explained without invoking compact companions .",
    "the sample includes one case where we appear to detect a resolved companion rather than the tycho-2 star , and a further eight which appear to be chance alignments .",
    "this is comparable to the expectation of five coincidences and may include a few more undetected resolved companions .",
    "the hot stars include two be stars , one of which is a @xmath11  cas analog .",
    "the remaining four spectroscopically identified ob stars show @xmath392 as is commonly found for x - rays from the winds of these stars .    a substantial fraction of our sources , 12 objects out of 38 that have spectroscopic classifications , are a stars .",
    "one of these is a known algol , v846  oph , and the others include a disproportionate number of objects showing infrared excesses , and we expect that the x - rays in most or all of these objects come from cooler companions .",
    "these systems appear divided between some with very pronounced ir excesses that appear to have sub - giant or giant companions , and others with weaker or no ir excess consistent with main - sequence or mildly evolved companions .    among the late - type stars",
    "a few stand out as having high @xmath393 ratios , and hard x - ray spectra implying high temperature coronae .",
    "these include the active giant , cx4 , and a young k dwarf , cx7 .",
    "several other stars show quite high levels of activity .",
    "the remainder of the late - type stars have lower @xmath384 ratios , and typically no evidence for variability .",
    "some of these sources are rather close , in particular the one m dwarf in our sample , cxb93 , and the modest x - ray luminosities implied can be accounted for by normal coronal emission .",
