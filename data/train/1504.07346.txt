    "study of the nature of light scalars @xmath3 and @xmath10 , well - established part of the proposed light scalar meson nonet @xcite , is one of the central problems of nonperturbative qcd , it is important for understanding the way chiral symmetry is realized in the low energy region and , consequently , for the understanding of confinement .",
    "many papers have already been devoted to this subject , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "naively one could think that the scalar @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons are the @xmath11 p - wave states with the same quark structure as @xmath4 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "but now there are many indications that the above scalars are four - quark states , see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of these indications is the suppression of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 resonances in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions , respectively , predicted in 1982 @xcite and confirmed by experiment @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "the elucidation of the mechanisms of the @xmath15 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 resonance production in the @xmath16 collisions confirmed their four - quark structure @xcite .",
    "light scalar mesons are produced in @xmath16 collisions mainly via rescatterings , that is , via the four - quark transitions .",
    "as for the @xmath4 and @xmath12 , the well - known @xmath11 states , they are produced mainly via the two quark transitions ( direct couplings with @xmath16 ) .    another argument in favor of the four - quark nature of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 is the fact that the @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays proceed through the kaon loop : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , i.e. via the four - quark transition @xcite .",
    "the kaon loop model was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed by the experiment ten years later @xcite .",
    "recently the comparative study of the scalar and tensor mesons was proposed in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions ( i.e. in the timelike region of @xmath23 ) @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath24 in the spacelike region of @xmath23 .    in 2009 belle collaboration published high - statistical data on the @xmath1 reaction @xcite .",
    "these data revealed the specific feature of the @xmath25 cross section : it turned out sizable in the region between the @xmath3 and @xmath26 resonances , that certainly indicates the presence of additional contributions .",
    "the experimenters took into account the putative heavy isovector scalar @xmath27 with mass about @xmath28 gev ( they called it @xmath29 ) along with @xmath3 and @xmath4 together with the polynomial coherent background @xcite .    in the theoretical works refs .",
