    "a classical nova eruption ( see @xcite for a review ) is a thermonuclear runaway in a cataclysmic variable ( cv ; a semi - detached binary in which a white dwarf primary accretes from a late - type , usually m dwarf , secondary ) .",
    "the runaway is caused when @xmath0 m@xmath1 of hydrogen - rich gas is accreted onto the white dwarf surface ; this material becomes degenerate , until the pressure and temperature at the base of this envelope starts the runaway reaction .",
    "a nova eruption ejects most of the accreted envelope . after a poorly known recurrence time",
    "( 10@xmath2  10@xmath3 years ) , the underlying binary accumulates enough fresh fuel to erupt again .",
    "novae are of interest to nuclear astrophysicists ; they are useful as extragalactic distance indicators ; they play a role in galactic chemical evolution ; and they are likely sources of @xmath4-rays . to understand a nova , it is essential to study the underlying system away from its eruption .",
    "conversely , the study of nova eruptions is essential to understand the secular evolution of cvs .",
    "the subject of this paper , dq  herculis ( nova herculis 1934 ) , has played a key historical role in the studies of nova eruptions and of post - nova binaries ( hereafter old novae ) due to its brightness and fortuitous viewing geometry . the 1934 classical nova eruption of dq  her  reached @xmath5 and enabled extensive observations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the discovery of eclipses in dq  her  @xcite was pivotal in establishing the standard picture of cvs .",
    "@xcite also discovered the coherent 71 sec photometric oscillation : we now understand that dq  her  contains a magnetic white dwarf , accreting onto the magnetic polar regions which are offset from the rotational poles , i.e. , an oblique rotator .",
    "the ejecta of the 1934 eruption are visible in h@xmath6 and other emission lines as an elliptical shell : as of 1978 , 43 years after the eruption , the equatorial and polar radii ( expansion velocities ) of the dq  her  shell were @xmath7 arcsec ( @xmath8 kms@xmath9 ) and @xmath10 arcsec ( @xmath11 kms@xmath9 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "they found no evidence for a deceleration of the expansion , and derived a revised distance estimate of 561@xmath1219 pc ( we use this value throughout this paper ) .",
    "this makes dq  her  among the nearest old novae known . by 1995 september ( 61 years after eruption ) , the equatorial and polar radii have grown to @xmath13 arcsec and @xmath14 arcsec , respectively , still consistent with no deceleration , according to our analysis of an archival _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 image .    the eclipsing nature of dq  her  in principle allows us to place tight constraints on its system parameters .",
    "the optical eclipse width , measured from mid - ingress to mid - egress as is customary , is 0.110@xmath120.003 cycles ( as compiled from literature by @xcite ) . assuming that the source of eclipsed light is centered on the white dwarf , this can be used to constrain the relationship between the mass ratio @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the masses of the white dwarf and the mass donor , respectively ) and the inclination angle @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary @xmath19 through the detection of the nai infrared doublet absorption lines .",
    "this , combined with the eclipse width and the @xmath20 from literature , have led to their estimates of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 m@xmath1 , and @xmath24 m@xmath1 .",
    "about 20 x - ray bright cvs with coherent spin modulations have been discovered since the late 1970s , and are classified as intermediate polars ( ips ) or dq  her   stars @xcite .",
    "they are among the brightest cvs in the 210 kev band , with luminosities generally in excess of @xmath25 ergss@xmath9 .",
    "however , the prototype dq  her  was _ not _ detected in an _",
    "einstein _",
    "imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) observation with a 2@xmath26 upper limit of 0.0046 cts@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one of their hypotheses , that high inclination may be the cause of this non - detection , found support in a model of the phase shifts of the 71-s oscillation during eclipse @xcite . in this model",
    ", a beam of high energy photons originating on the white dwarf is reprocessed by the accretion disk and results in the optical oscillation .",
    "@xcite finds a good fit at @xmath27 , although the actual value of @xmath18 can be lower , as long as the entire front half of the disk including the white dwarf is obscured by the outer edge of the disk .",
    "such permanent obscuration of the white dwarf would greatly reduce the x - rays reaching earth .    despite the high inclination angle ,",
    "x - rays were detected from dq  her  with the _ rosat _  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred luminosity ( 0.12.0 kev ) of @xmath28 ergss@xmath9 is modest for an ip .",
    "we note that , using a thermal plasma model with @xmath29 kev with n@xmath30=1.0 @xmath31 @xmath32 , consistent with the pspc spectrum , and the revised distance of 561 pc ( both are different from the values assumed by @xcite ) , the _ einstein _  ipc upper limit corresponds to 2.8 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the ipc band ( 0.44 kev ) , or 3.3 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the 0.12.0 kev band .",
    "these numbers may reflect source variability or the limit of accuracy of cross - instrument comparisons ; neither would be surprising .",
    "a deep eclipse is not observed , consistent with the permanent obscuration of the white dwarf , suggesting an alternative origin of the observed x - rays .",
    "although @xcite considered a likely origin to be the secondary , it has to be emitting x - rays at significantly above the saturation limit ( @xmath34 l@xmath35 , or a few times 10@xmath36 ergs@xmath9 in this case ) seen in rapidly rotating late type dwarfs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if not the secondary , what is the origin of the soft x - rays observed from dq  her ?    only @xmath37150 photons were detected in the _ rosat _  observation , insufficient for further progress .",
    "we have therefore secured a _",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation of dq  her .",
    "we describe the observation and data reduction in  2 , present the results in  3 , and discuss the implications in  4 .",
    "we observed dq  her  with _ chandra _",
    "@xcite acis without a grating , placing the object on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "the observations were performed as two pointings , one from 2001 july 26 13:00 ut to july 27 02:31 ut and the other from 2001 july 29 17:09 ut to july 30 02:27 ut , for a total integration time of 68.8 ksec .",
    "these observations were performed at near identical pointing positions and roll angles .",
    "we took the outputs from the processing pipeline at the _ chandra _  x - ray center , and extracted images , spectra , and light curves from these observations individually , before combining the results .",
    "we detect a source at ra = 18h07m30.24s , dec=+45d51m32.6s using the ciao routine celldetect .",
    "although this is offset by 1.7@xmath38 from the position of dq  her  given in @xcite , this is likely to reflect the limitation of comparison of positions measured using different astrometric reference frames ( downes 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "we identify this x - ray source with dq  her  based on this positional coincidence and based on the orbital variability ( see  3.2 below ) .",
    "we extracted source spectra and light curves from a 5 arcsec radius circular region , and background from an annulus of 40 arcsec outer radius and 20 arcsec inner radius centered on the source .",
    "the size of the background annulus is chosen to exclude the nova shell emission ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the source count rate is 0.025 ctss@xmath9 ( 3 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the 0.25 kev band , based on the spectral model discussed below ) , while the background in the source region ( scaled from the counts in the background region by the detector areas ) is estimated to be 8.2@xmath39 ctss@xmath9 .",
    "dq  her  did not show a significant difference in count rate between the two observations .",
    "there is a bump in the observed acis - s spectrum of dq  her  around 1 kev ( left panel , figure 1 ) which is not in the instrument response . because of this , the spectrum can not be fitted with smooth continuum models ( power - law , bremsstrahlung or black body ) alone . using models of optically thin thermal plasma emission , such as mekal @xcite",
    ", the 1 kev bump is interpreted as a complex of lines in the 0.61.2 kev range , notably lines of oviii ( 0.64 kev ) , fexvii ( 0.73 & 0.83 kev ) , and neix ( 0.90 kev ) .",
    "these lines , however , are weaker relative to the continuum than the predictions of single - temperature plasma models .",
    "moreover , the continuum above 2 kev is much stronger than expected for plasma temperatures that give rise to these lines ( kt@xmath370.6 kev ) . as a result",
    ", a single component mekal model fit also fails to reproduce the observed spectrum .    the simplest successful representation ( @xmath40=1.4 ; see figure 1 ) is a two - component model consisting of kt=0.59@xmath120.04 kev mekal plasma model plus a power law of photon index 2.7@xmath120.2 , with n@xmath30  = 2.9 @xmath41 @xmath32 .",
    "the power - law component in our model provides the added continuum necessary to achieve an acceptable fit , both near the lines ( 0.81.2 kev ) and at higher energies ( 25 kev ) .",
    "inferred intrinsic flux in the 0.25 kev band is 8.2 @xmath42 ergs@xmath32s@xmath9 , or a luminosity of 3.1 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 .",
    "dq  her  was not significantly detected above 5.0 kev ( we obtain a count rate and an estimated 1@xmath26 error in the 58 kev band of @xmath43 ctss@xmath9 ) , although this is in part due to the lower effective area of the _ chandra _  acis instrument at high energies .",
    "we take @xmath44 ctss@xmath9 as our upper limit , which corresponds to @xmath45 ergss@xmath9 assuming a power law spectral shape with a photon index of 2 and a source distance of 561 pc .",
    "note , however , that our adopted model for the spectrum is not unique .",
    "given the modest number of detected photons ( @xmath371700 ) , and instrumental limitations ( both in bandpass and in spectral resolution ) , there can be a wide range of models that fit the data .",
    "we are only confident that dq  her  shows a spectral feature around 1 kev which mimics a collisionally excited , optically - thin plasma of kt@xmath370.6 kev .",
    "the presence of such a plasma would also lead to a si line at 1.85 kev , which may also be present in the data .",
    "consequently , spectral modeling alone of the _ chandra _  data is insufficient to uncover the origin of the soft x - rays in dq  her .",
    "we show , in figure 2 , the acis light curve of dq  her  folded on the orbital ephemeris of @xcite into 16 bins per cycle .",
    "the ephemeris has an estimated accuracy of @xmath1211 s for this epoch ( see  4.1 for further details ) . a partial eclipse , lasting for about 3 bins and about 30% deep , is clearly seen .",
    "in this representation , the x - ray eclipse center appears to be offset from the ephemeris prediction by one half of the bin size , i.e. , 0.03 cycle or 500 s. moreover , the x - ray eclipse appears to be wider ( 3 bins , or 0.1875 cycles ) than the optical eclipse ( 0.110@xmath120.003 , according to a compilation in @xcite ) , which should be 2 bins in figure 2 .    to quantify this impression ,",
    "we have fit the 32 bin per cycle version of the light curve using a piecewise linear function with symmetric ingress and egress ; we show our best - fit model in figure 2 .",
    "the eclipse center is found to be at phase 0.033@xmath46 ( 90% confidence ) , confirming the offset .",
    "however , the eclipse width ( mid - ingress to mid - egress ) is measured to be 0.18@xmath47 ( 90% ) cycle , thus we can not claim that the x - ray eclipse is definitely wider than in the optical .",
    "in addition to the formal uncertainties , there is additional uncertainty arising from our choice of specific model , thus both these numbers need confirmation .",
    "our _ chandra _  data are of insufficient quality for us to be able to derive further details of the eclipse profile , such as ingress / egress durations .      at first glance , the _ chandra _  acis image of dq  her  looks like that of a point source .",
    "indeed , over 70% of the flux is contained within 1 arcsec ( @xmath37560 au , or 8.4@xmath48 cm ) of the image centroid , as expected for a soft point source .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the image shows that there is a region about 2 arcsec by 2 arcsec in area and about 10 arcsec ne of the point source with more photons ( 28 ) than are expected by chance ( @xmath378 ) .",
    "these excess counts appear equally distributed over this area , and does not display the sharply peaked core of the point spread function ( psf ) expected of a point source .    we have investigated this further by constructing radial profiles of the acis image of dq  her  in several energy bands .",
    "we then fit a model consisting of a flat background plus the psf available in the _ chandra _   calibration database ( interpolated in energy and off - axis angle as appropriate ) .",
    "we find notable excesses in the azimuthally - averaged radial profiles in the 0.20.5 and 0.50.8 kev bands ( figure 3 ; we find no significant features at energies above 0.8 kev , although this may in part due to poor counting statistics ) .",
    "the statistical significance of this is unfortunately difficult to establish : our experiences with other bright sources is that psf fit is usually less than perfect because of effects of pile - up , background non - uniformity , uncertainties in the point source location , and imperfect calibration of the psf .",
    "however , the structures ( clusters of several points above the best fit models ) seen in the radial profiles of dq  her  is unusual .",
    "the two features marked with horizontal bars ( one at 59 arcsec in the 0.20.5 kev band , and another at 810 arcsec in the 0.50.8 kev band ) contain 18.0@xmath124.6 and 12.2@xmath124.1 counts , respectively .",
    "other possible features either have too few photons ( the 67 arcsec bin in the 0.50.8 kev profile has 5 ) or outside the optically detected nova shell ( 1220 arcsec excess in the 0.20.5 kev profile ) and will not be discussed further . for the two features , we also construct an azimuthal histogram in 30 degree bins of photons falling within the appropriate radial and energy bins .",
    "we plot this in the insets of figure 3 as a histogram in polar coordinates ( the position angle on the graph corresponds to the position angle on the sky , and radial distance from the center is proportional to the number of photons in that bins ) .",
    "we find that the 0.20.5 kev feature is about 8 arcsec away s  sw of dq  her , while the 0.50.8 kev feature is about 9 arcsec away ne of the binary .",
    "the folded x - ray light curve appears to be offset from the ephemeris prediction by about 0.03 cycles , or 500 s. the phase offset is greater than 0.006 cycles , or 100 s , at 90% confidence level .",
    "our check of the data reduction processes ( such as the barycentric correction ) has not revealed any potential systematics that could account for such a large offset .",
    "the linear ephemeris , taken from @xcite , has a nominal error of 11 s for this epoch .",
    "moreover , their linear and quadratic ephemerides have diverged by less than 15 s. even though a long - term sinusoidal modulation in o@xmath49c eclipse timings has been found @xcite , the magnitude of this effect is 70 s. thus , we believe that the phase offset likely does not result from an inaccurate ephemeris .    instead , we consider it likely that the phase shift of the x - ray light curve is caused by departure from axial symmetry of the dq  her  system .",
    "we see a considerable scatter in the times of the optical eclipse , up to 170 s in the o@xmath49c timings , although some of it can be modeled by the sinusoidal term ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) . moreover , the eclipse light curves ( see their figure 1 ) are obviously skewed , with ingress beginning around phase @xmath490.08 and egress completing around phase + 0.12 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the departure from axisymmetry of the eclipsed object .",
    "we might still argue that the deepest point in the eclipse light curve marks the position of the unseen white dwarf . however , this is not necessarily the case , particularly if the eclipsed object is the back side of an asymmetric accretion disk @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the radial velocity study of the secondary , using the nai infrared doublet , shows that the inferior conjunction of the secondary is at phase 0.013@xmath120.009 on the eclipse ephemeris @xcite . this possible phase offset between the radial velocity curve of the secondary and the optical eclipse",
    "should be studied further . in any case",
    ", a non - axisymmetric disk can result in a phase offset between the optical and x - ray eclipses .",
    "our best - fit x - ray eclipse width is also larger than the optical eclipse width , although in this case they can be equal within 90% confidence limits .",
    "we do not necessarily expect the two to be equal , since the model of @xcite for the phase shift of the 71-s oscillations suggests that the emission - weighted center of eclipsed light is somewhere on the back half of the accretion disk , not centered on the white dwarf .",
    "if true , the inclination angle @xmath18 derived with the latter assumption @xcite would be an underestimate for a given @xmath50 .",
    "we can not solve this difficulty with the data in hand , so we treat this as an extra source of uncertainty in the analysis to follow .      at this inclination , a partial eclipse is a signature of an extended emission region . any x - ray emission or scattering from the surface of the accretion disk should be as deeply eclipsed as the optical light from the disk .",
    "since the x - ray eclipse is much shallower than in the optical , we conclude that the x - rays must originate in a vertically extended region . assuming the best - fit system parameters of @xcite",
    ", we estimate that materials that are @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the binary separation ) above the orbital plane should remain uneclipsed",
    ". the limit could be somewhat larger if the inclination is underestimated by @xcite .",
    "is this a single , extended x - ray source , or can there be an eclipsed component and an uneclipsed component ? from the data in hand , we can not rule out the latter possibility . we could test this if we had a higher quality x - ray light curve of the eclipse .",
    "a two - component model would predict a sharp ingress and egress , while a single extended source would result in a more gradual eclipse transitions . here",
    "we proceed assuming a single extended source , since we do not have a physical model corresponding to the two - component model .    the partial eclipse of uv emission lines in dq  her  also demonstrates the presence of an extended emission region @xcite .",
    "the last authors , in particular , have analyzed the time - resolved profile of the civ @xmath531550 line through the eclipse . at mid - eclipse",
    ", this line is clearly redshifted , which they argue is a strong indication that the residual line flux originates in an accretion disk wind ( see also figure 7 . of @xcite ) , even though an accretion disk wind is usually seen only in non - magnetic cvs with high accretion rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these systems have an accretion disk that extends all the way down to the white dwarf surface and an optically thick boundary layer .",
    "the presence of wind in dq  her , a system with no boundary layer and a luminous but truncated disk , suggests that the accretion geometry does not dictate whether a cv has a wind or not @xcite .",
    "dq  her  appears to be sufficient luminous to drive a wind , as the fluxes of the heii recombination lines in dq  her  requires an ionizing luminosity of order @xmath54 ergss@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the presence of the accretion disk wind in dq  her  might make this an unusual ip , since we are not aware of any reports of accretion disk winds in other ips .",
    "instead , it suggests a natural parallel with the dwarf nova oy  car in superoutburst and the nova like system ux  uma .",
    "both are bright non - magnetic cv with accretion disk wind ; both are deeply eclipsing in the optical yet no x - ray eclipses were observed in oy  car in supreoutburst @xcite or in ux  uma @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted to imply that the central x - ray source in these systems can not be seen directly , but instead is seen indirectly after scattering in an extended corona or wind .",
    "the _ euve _",
    "observation of oy  car in superoutburst @xcite confirms this basic picture , since the observed spectrum can be modeled as resonant scattering of continuum photons in an accretion disk wind . a wind , rather than a static corona , is strongly favored since",
    "the euv emission lines are seen to have fwhm of @xmath372300 kms@xmath9 .",
    "we believe the same resonant scattering model can be applied to the observed soft x - rays from dq  her , except that the nature of the unseen central source must be different ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "a static corona can also be the scattering site for the x - ray photons observed in dq  her .",
    "however , that would make it different from oy  car , where the euv line widths prove the wind to be responsible for scattering .",
    "secondly , the uv line profile during the eclipse is indicative of a wind , while we do not know if a static corona exists in this system .",
    "finally , the depth of the partial eclipse demands a large vertical extent ( @xmath51 , see above ) for the scattering region .",
    "this is well away from the disk and probably is an unlikely location for a static corona .",
    "we therefore interpret the observed soft x - rays as due to resonant scattering of an unseen central source .",
    "furthermore , we prefer the accretion disk wind as the scattering site , pending final confirmation in the form of x - ray line widths . it is interesting to note that a partial x - ray eclipse is detected in dq  her , while none has been found in oy  car or ux  uma .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether this indicates some difference in the wind geometry compared with between dq  her  and non - magnetic systems , or if this is simply due to the more extreme inclination angle in dq  her .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of 35 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 is likely to be a small fraction of the intrinsic luminosity of the central source , although this depends strongly on the unknown efficiency of scattering in the wind .",
    "the flux of the he  ii  @xmath55 line has been used to estimate an ionizing luminosity of 12 @xmath56 ergss@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "can this be in the form of a hard component ( kt@xmath3720 kev bremsstrahlung ) usually seen in ips ? to investigate this question , we have modeled the reflection of such a component off the surface of the roche - lobe filling secondary , applying the method of @xcite developed for hercules x-1 .",
    "x - rays hitting the cold material on the surface of the secondary can be scattered or absorbed ; since softer photons are more likely to be absorbed , the scattered component is harder than the incident component .",
    "we have evaluated the 58 kev flux expected from reflection from the secondary as a function of the orbital phase , taking into account the shadowing by the accretion disk and the roche - lobe filling shape of the secondary , assuming the system parameters of @xcite , as listed in  1 . for the computational details , see @xcite .",
    "the reflection component should be most prominent at the highest energy band of _ chandra _ , 58 kev .",
    "the viewing geometry for the reflection component is most favorable at orbital phase 0.5 ; it would result in a strong , sinusoidal orbital modulation .",
    "however , no such component is detected in our _ chandra _  data in the 58 kev data .",
    "this can be converted to the upper limit of the bolometric luminosity of the hard component as a function of the disk thickness ( figure 4 ) .",
    "taking our upper limit in the phase bin around phase 0.5 , 1/16th cycle wide , to be 7.0@xmath39 ctss@xmath9 , we estimate an upper limit to the kt=20 kev bremsstrahlung luminosity of 10@xmath57 ergss@xmath9 for a disk @xmath58 ( height over radius ) of less than 0.23 , or half - opening angle @xmath59 ( @xmath60 for a kt=50 kev bremsstrahlung due to the different bolometric correction ) .",
    "if the intrinsic hard component luminosity is 10@xmath61 ergss@xmath9 , the reflected luminosity can be reduced to an undetectable level if the disk half opening angle is @xmath62 for kt=20 kev ( @xmath63 for kt=50 kev ) , almost completely shadowing the secondary .    in comparison , the eclipsing and dipping low - mass x - ray binary exo0748@xmath49676 has an inclination of @xmath64 @xcite : the presence of x - ray eclipses require the opening angle of the disk to be less than 15@xmath65 toward the secondary in this system . although azimuthal structures at such heights are commonly inferred ( including one in u gem 25@xmath65 above the disk ; @xcite ) , we are not aware of claims for disks thicker than 15@xmath65 in the direction toward the secondary . we therefore conclude that the central hard x - ray component is less luminous than inferred from the he  ii  @xmath55 line , unless the disk in dq  her  has an unusually large thickness .",
    "further studies of the disk thickness , however , are required to tighten the upper limit of the hard component luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the lack of reflection component does not allow us to put a useful constraint on the central luminosity , if it has a soft spectrum .",
    "accretion luminosity in dq  her  would be dominated by a soft , blackbody - like component , if the shock is buried within the white dwarf atmosphere .",
    "in addition , the entire photosphere of the primary may still be hot from the thermonuclear runaway of 1934 .",
    "the soft component in am her type magnetic cvs have a typical temperature of 2030 ev @xcite ; even using a kt=100 ev blackbody , the spectrum is too soft to result in appreciable reflection signature .",
    "therefore , our results are consistent with the ionizing luminosity of 12 @xmath56 ergss@xmath9 @xcite if this is in the form of a soft component , regardless of the disk height .",
    "we appear to have detected extended emission features , one about 8 arcsec s to sw of , and another about 9 ne of dq  her .",
    "the latter location corresponds to a bright [ nii ] knot in the dq  her  shell , while the former has no obvious optical feature associated with it @xcite .",
    "we consider it likely that these small excesses are real and represent x - ray knots in the dq  her  shell . a similar , but much brighter",
    ", x - ray shell has been seen around gk  per ( nova persei 1901 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this shell has a soft thermal spectrum , with a prominent neix line at 0.9 kev @xcite .",
    "we do not have enough photons for a spectral analysis for the dq  her  shell , but it appears much softer than the gk  per shell .",
    "this could result from a different speed class ( dq  her  was a slow nova , while gk  per was a fast nova ) , as well as from a different environment around dq  her  than around gk  per .",
    "the luminosity in the dq  her  knot appears to be a few times 10@xmath66 ergss@xmath9 , subject to a large uncertainty in count rate to flux conversion , due to the unknown spectral shape .",
    "given the probable discovery of x - rays from the shell , and the apparent lack of strong hard x - rays from the central source , it may be useful to revisit the models of uv and optical spectra of the shell .",
    "for example , @xcite assumed a hard x - ray emitting magnetic cv with a luminosity in excess of 10@xmath61 ergss@xmath9 as the source of ionizing photons .",
    "our work casts some doubt on such a picture .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , assumed a 10@xmath3 k blackbody source , which is consistent with our x - ray data of the central binary .",
    "however , how do the shell x - rays fit in ?    @xcite interprets the x - rays from the gk  per shell as a miniature supernova remnant . in this model",
    ", the nova ejecta are plowing into the surrounding interstellar medium and shock heated into x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "there certainly is ample kinetic energy in the nova ejecta to power shell x - ray emission , and the ejecta velocities are fast enough to result in x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "the photoionization model of uv and optical lines , on the other hand , suggest a cold shell .",
    "we regard this not as an outright contradiction , but as an additional evidence for the co - existence of hot and cold matter in nova shells .",
    "we have long known of spectra that show both hot and cold components in nova shells @xcite .",
