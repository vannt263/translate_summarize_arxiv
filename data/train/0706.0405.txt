    "<S> the influence of the various model parameters on the numerical stability is analyzed and some reference values of parameter are suggested . the new scheme works for both subsonic and supersonic flows with a mach number up to @xmath0 ( or higher ) , which is validated by well - known benchmark tests . simulations on riemann problems with very high ratios ( @xmath1 ) of pressure and density also show good accuracy and stability . </S>",
    "<S> successful recovering of regular and double mach shock reflections shows the potential application of the lattice boltzmann model to fluid systems where non - equilibrium processes are intrinsic . </S>",
    "<S> the new scheme for stability can be easily extended to other lattice boltzmann models . </S>"
