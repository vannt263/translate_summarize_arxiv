    "quantum groups have become an indispensable tool in many areas of mathematical physics and mathematics . in a broad class of quantum theoretical models",
    "it has turned out that finding a relation to a quantum group is the key for obtaining exact information about the spectrum or the correlation functions .",
    "so far most of the vast amount of work devoted to quantum group theory and their physical applications was concerned with quantum groups that can be studied in a purely algebraic manner .",
    "this is the case e.g. if the relevant representations are highest weight representations , as is often assumed .",
    "however , in physical applications to quantum theoretical models the choice of a scalar product on the space of states usually determines the hermiticity relations for the representatives of the quantum group generators . in many cases like those corresponding to the so - called _ non - compact _ quantum groups it turns out that the corresponding unitary representations are always infinite - dimensional and generically neither of highest nor lowest weight type . in order to exploit the information provided by the appearance of such a quantum group it is clearly important to have efficient mathematical tools for analyzing the corresponding representation theory .",
    "unfortunately there are comparatively few results about the representation theory of non - compact quantum groups .",
    "this seems to be an important obstacle for making further progress in many quantum integrable models .",
    "nevertheless there is an interesting example that was first studied independently in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these references were considering a particular class of infinite dimensional unitary representations of @xmath0 .",
    "this class of representations , henceforth denoted @xmath3 , @xmath4 , was the also first to be used in a concrete physical application : understanding the tensor products of the above - mentioned representations was crucial for obtaining exact results on the quantum liouville theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "a rather remarkable duality phenomenon was observed in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the representations in question are simultaneously representations of the two quantum groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 with deformation parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "this duality turns out to be deeply related to the quantum field theoretical self - duality of liouville theory under the change of the coupling constant @xmath9 into @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is this duality under @xmath11 that allows one to cover the so - called _ strong - coupling _ regime where @xmath12 by analytic continuation of the results for real values of @xmath9 @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper clarify the origin of this phenomenon to a certain extent .",
    "given the operators @xmath13 representing one of the two algebras , say @xmath5 , one may obtain the representatives of the second algebra @xmath6 as _ nonpolynomial _ operator functions of the operators @xmath13 .",
    "this is found to be consistent with the respective co - products . in particular , restricting attention to only one of the two algebras does not lead to any degeneracy as is sometimes suggested in the literature .",
    "faddeev has proposed to unite the quantum groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 into some enlarged object for which he has coined the name `` modular double '' .",
    "the proposal of @xcite as refined in @xcite amounts to defining it as the product of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where , roughly speaking , @xmath14 is obtained from @xmath5 by adjoining a sign to the center generated by the casimir of @xmath5 .",
    "we feel that this definition for the modular double has a disadvantage , though .",
    "most representations of @xmath16 are simply tensor products of representations of the two factors .",
    "the representations @xmath3 on the contrary are distinguished by the fact that they do _ not _ factorize as a tensor product of representations for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is what makes the duality under @xmath11 a nontrivial statement .",
    "since the category formed by the representations @xmath3 is _ closed _ under tensor products @xcite it seems natural to look for the group - like object that contains the interesting representations @xmath3 _",
    "only_.    we therefore propose to look for a definition of the `` modular double '' that excludes the representations of @xmath17 which factorize trivially .",
    "this definition should still capture the duality phenomenon mentioned above .",
    "as we have indicated , this naturally leads us to consider nonpolynomial functions of the generators .",
    "the basic objects underlying our approach to the modular double will be an algebra @xmath18 of _ bounded _ operators , a coproduct @xmath19 on @xmath18 , an invariant integration ( haar - measure ) on @xmath18 and the r - operator proposed in @xcite .",
    "we are going to establish the main properties satisfied by these objects , which are all _ self - dual _ under @xmath11 .",
    "the algebra @xmath18 can be thought of as being generated from operators that represent @xmath5 in a similar ( in fact , closely related ) way as the algebra of bounded operators on @xmath20 is related to the usual quantum mechanical position and momentum operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our point of view is inspired by the one of woronowicz @xcite , which has stimulated the development of a theory for noncompact quantum groups in a @xmath23-algebraic framework , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . however , although we believe that our results represent substantial progress towards a proof that the modular double fits into such a @xmath23-algebraic framework , it was not our aim to actually carry out such a proof here .",
    "we also clarify the relation between the r - operator proposed in @xcite and the calculus of clebsch - gordan and racah - wigner - coefficients of @xcite .",
    "establishing this relation is important for the following reason . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that certain families of representations of the virasoro algebra and of the quantum group @xmath0 behave equivalently under the respective product operations ( fusion and tensor product ) .",
    "together with the results of the present paper it follows that the respective _ braiding _ operations are equivalent as well .    to be specific we will mostly consider the case that the deformation parameter is of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath24 .",
    "however , our results will carry over to the `` strong coupling regime '' @xmath12 , see the remarks in subsection [ strong ] .",
    "@xmath0 is a hopf - algebra with @xmath25=\\frac{k^2-k^{-2}}{q - q^{-1}};\\\\ & \\text{star - structure:}\\quad   k^*=k , \\qquad e^*=e , \\qquad f^*=f \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the center of @xmath0 is generated by the @xmath26-casimir @xmath27 compared to the definition used in @xcite we have redefined @xmath28 .",
    "this will allow us to realize @xmath29 by positive operators .      in the present paper we will study a one - parameter class @xmath30 , @xmath31 , of representations of @xmath32 .",
    "they are constructed as follows : the representation will be realized on the space @xmath30 of entire analytic functions @xmath33 that have a fourier - transform @xmath34 which is meromorphic in @xmath35 with the possible poles contained in @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the representation of @xmath0 on @xmath3 is then defined by choosing the representatives @xmath38 for @xmath39 to be the following finite difference operators @xmath40 where @xmath22 and @xmath21 are self - adjoint operators satisfying @xmath41=(2\\pi i)^{-1}$ ] . by embedding @xmath3 as a dense subspace into the hilbert space @xmath20 one obtains a unitary representation of @xmath0 generated from the self - adjoint operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite",

    "this means that @xmath46 decomposes into the representations @xmath3 as follows : @xmath58 the representations @xmath3 and @xmath59 are unitarily equivalent @xcite : there exists a unitary operator @xmath60 such that @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",

    "these operators @xmath83 form a subalgebra @xmath85 of the algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath45 . let @xmath86 be the @xmath23 subalgebra obtained as the completion of @xmath85 w.r.t . the operator norm .",
