    "duality @xcite is an important symmetry of ising models , as it implies a relationship between the partition functions of two ising models with hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are some nonsingular functions of interaction constants @xmath5 appearing in hamiltonians @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "similar functional relations between the partition functions of two different ising models can be also obtained with the help of the decoration , star - triangle or star - square transformations @xcite .",
    "duality combined with those transformations enables one to derive the expressions for the critical temperature for a wide range of ising models .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in the case of duality the total number of spin interactions must be the same for both hamiltonians , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which allows one to introduce the concept of dual lattice .",
    "for example , the triangular lattice turns out dual to the honeycomb lattice and the rectangular lattice is dual to itself . using the concept of dual lattice",
    ", the duality relation can be interpreted as a relationship between high - temperature ( low - temperature ) expansion for the model with hamiltonian @xmath6 and the low - temperature ( high - temperature ) expansion for the model described by @xmath7 .",
    "the concept of duality has been extended by wegner @xcite for a wider class of ising models @xmath8 on d - dimensional lattices characterized by a number @xmath9 , where @xmath10 corresponds to the ising model with a two - spin interaction . in this paper",
    "we construct and investigate analytically the dual model to the ising model on a rectangular lattice with the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( nnni model ) @xcite .",
    "although this simple extension of the onsager model has been widely investigated for decades now , no analytical expression for the partition function of the model has been found , nor its dual model has been presented . to this end",
    "we use the usual algebraic approach and express the partition function as the trace of a power of the transfer matrix . in we employ the classic 2d ising model on a rectangular lattice to introduce the formalism and some basic formulas necessary to investigate the duality of a more complex model in . in particular , we show how the self - dual symmetry of this model can be related to the similarity transformation ( @xmath11 ) of the transfer matrix . we show that the difference between two forms of the transfer matrix can be related to a change of the direction in which the matrix was constructed and present the explicit form of @xmath11 . in",
    "we apply the similarity transformation to the transfer matrix of the nnni model .",
    "we show that there exists a simple ising model for which the transformed matrix is the transfer matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model contains a two - spin nearest - neighbor interaction between nodes of the brick - wall lattice ( which is topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice ) and additional four - spin interactions ( henceforth this model will be called the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model ) .",
    "the number of the four - spin interactions is equal to the number of bricks in the lattice . since the two hamiltonians have the same number of all interactions , the model can be regarded as the dual model to the nnni model .",
    "as a result we obtain the duality relation between the partition functions of these two models .",
    "moreover , we show that the dual model becomes self - dual in the presence of an external magnetic field . in   the critical temperature of",
    "the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model is investigated .",
    "we show that an increase in the critical temperature of the dual model caused by the four - spin interactions is limited to a finite range .",
    "we derive the equations for both the lower and upper limits of this temperature range and find that they depend on the magnitude of the two - spin interactions only .",
    "consider the classical ising model with the nearest - neighbor interaction constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( for simplicity , we assume that @xmath14 ) on a rectangular lattice with @xmath15 columns and @xmath16 rows . we assume the cyclic boundary conditions in the direction of the transfer matrix action and in the perpendicular direction we adjust the boundary conditions to the transformations performed on the transfer matrix to get the result in a closed form ( we adopt this convention throughout this paper ) .",
    "the partition function for this model reads @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 matrices defined by @xmath23 with @xmath24 where the symbol @xmath25 denotes the tensor product , @xmath26 is the @xmath27 unit matrix , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) represent the pauli matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 runs through the @xmath16 nodes of a lattice column .",
    "it turns out that @xmath20 and @xmath21 a related to each other by a similarity transformation @xmath11 , @xmath32 relations of this type were found to be essential in proving the duality or self - duality of many ising models , including the self - duality of the 1d ising model with an external transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "applying under the trace operator in , one obtains @xmath33 using the cyclicity of the trace operator , can be rewritten in a well - known form @xmath34 which proves the self - duality of the discussed model .",
    "was usually derived by constructing the transfer matrix along different directions of the lattice , without deriving the explicit form of @xmath11 , which however will be necessary in our study further below . to obtain it",
    ", one can assume that it can be expressed as a product of two @xmath35 matrices @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a permutation matrix , whereas @xmath38 exchanges pauli matrices @xmath39 with @xmath40 and changes the signs of the interaction coefficients appropriately .",

    "the transfer matrix for the ising model with the nearest and next - nearearest neighbor interactions was found in 1956 by temperley @xcite , who constructed it along the diagonal of the basic rectangular lattice defined by the nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "although this matrix is not of the lowest possible rank , its form is particularly simple .",
    "we will use this matrix for the rhomboidal lattice presented in .    ,",
    "@xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the interaction constants for the diagonal , horizontal and vertical directions , respectively . ]",
    "while in most papers devoted to the nnni model only two interaction constant are used @xcite , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , here we consider the general case with three arbitrary constants controlling the ferromagnetic interactions @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the transfer matrix and the partition function for this model on the rhomboidal lattice consisting of @xmath65 nodes satisfy @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath20 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are matrices of size @xmath35 , defined as follows , @xmath74 with @xmath75 denoting the set of even numbers .",
    "the correspondence between these matrices and the interaction constants are shown in .",
    "similar transfer matrices for the nnni model were already used in @xcite , however , without giving their explicit forms .    on applying the similarity transformation @xmath11 to the matrices of the nnni model we arrive at @xmath76 which also defines @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "these relations lead to @xmath81 where @xmath82    equation ( [ eq : duality - uj ] ) ensures that if there exists an ising model whose transfer matrix is equal to @xmath83 , this model will be dual to the nnni model .",
    "this is a nontrivial requirement , as while the transfer matrix of any ising model can be expressed as a product of exponential matrices , the product of exponential matrices is hardly ever the transfer matrix of an ising model . in the case",
    "considered here , however , such a model exists and is described by the hamiltonian @xmath84 defined on the brick - wall lattice @xcite , which is topologically equivalent to the honeycomb lattice . as explained in ,        @xmath85 is the four - spin interaction constant for the four spins occupying the right - hand side of a brick , and the values of the nearest - neighbor interaction constants @xmath86 are non - zero only if @xmath87 and @xmath31 are on the same side of a brick , in which case they are equal @xmath88 and @xmath89 for interactions along the vertical and horizontal direction , respectively .",
    "all interaction constants are ferromagnetic in nature ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the dual lattice is composed of @xmath16 horizontal chains , each containing @xmath91 nodes .",

    "its explicit form can be obtained from onsager s classical transfer matrix for the rectangular lattice @xcite , see .",
    "first , we add the four - spin interactions that modify only two horizontal two - spin bonds lying one above the other .",
    "next , half of the vertical two - spin interactions connecting the horizontal chains has to be removed . while adding the four - spin interactions to the transfer matrix",
    ", we can use a relationship @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "finally , we find the duality relationship between the nnni model , , and the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model , , @xmath101^{mn/2}},\\ ] ] where the relations between the interaction constants for both model are given by @xmath102",
    "while the ising model on the brick - wall lattice can be solved exactly @xcite , addition of the four - spin interaction makes it intractable analytically . however , it turns out that it is still possible to draw some important conclusions about the way the critical temperature of the ising model defined by hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_j_j4 ] ) depends on the strength of the four - spin interactions .    in the ising model with nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions ( nnni model , )",
    "there are two important limiting cases : @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the former case",
    "the nnni model reduces to the ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions on the triangular lattice with the interaction constants @xmath105 . since in this case @xmath106 , matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 appearing in",
    "become the identity matrices and the critical point of this model can be determined exactly .",
    "it is worth noticing that the duality transformation converts the transfer matrix of this model into the transfer matrix of the ising model with two nearest - neighbor interactions on a honey comb lattice equivalent to the brick - wall lattice .",
    "this explains why the dual model to nnni model is defined on the brick - wall lattice . in the second case ( @xmath104 ) , the nnni model splits into two identical independent self - dual ising models with nearest - neighbor interactions on the rectangular lattice .",
    "similarly to the previous case , matrices @xmath109 in become the identity matrices and the critical point for this model is exactly determinable .    , which describes relationships between the interactions of the nnni and ( 2 + 4 ) bwi models , reduces to @xmath110 for @xmath103 and to @xmath111 for @xmath104 .",
    "is equivalent to @xmath112 , whereas can be satisfied only in the limit of @xmath113 .",
    "the critical temperatures satisfy @xcite @xmath114 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",

    "the solid and dotted lines are the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e_cosh_tanh ] ) and ( [ eq : e_cosh_e_sinh ] ) , respectively , and the crosses indicate a possible location of the phase transition .",
    "@xmath119 is the critical temperature for the ising model on a brick - wall lattice and @xmath120 is the maximum critical temperature for the ferromagnetic case of the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model . ]",
    "the solid line represents the asymptotic solution for the case @xmath121 obtained from , and the dotted line depicts the asymptotic solution of obtained for @xmath113 .",
    "the solution of has only the left - hand vertical asymptote at the temperature @xmath122 given as the solution to @xmath123 which yields @xmath124 .",
    "the fact that has only the left - hand side asymptote at the critical point defined by @xmath113 is in contradiction to the griffith s inequalities @xcite , which imply that if an additional ferromagnetic interaction is introduced into a ferromagnetic ising model , the critical temperature @xmath125 will increase with the magnitude of this additional interaction .",
    "therefore , this solution has to be rejected as nonphysical .",
    "our preliminary computer simulations ( which will be discussed elsewhere ) suggest that the relation between @xmath115 and @xmath126 is located along the line marked with crosses in , with the right vertical asymptote at the point given by .",
    "our considerations show that the additional four - spin interaction in the ising model on a brick wall lattice does not yield an infinite increase of the critical temperature . instead , the critical temperature is always limited by a condition involving two - spin interactions only . in order to confirm this qualitative result obtained for a particular choice of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we plan to perform detailed computer simulations of the model .",
    "as in other pairs of ising models , the inclusion of an external magnetic field makes the duality relationship between the nnni and the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi models cease to exist : duality relations ( [ eq : duality - uj - bm ] )  ( [ lll - kkk ] ) were obtained only in the absence of an external magnetic field . however , the ising model described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_j_j4 ] ) has an additional internal symmetry .",
    "if one adds to the hamiltonian an interaction with an external magnetic field @xmath127 , then the partition function will take the form @xmath128^{mn/2 } } =         \\operatorname{tr } \\left(v \\right)^{n},\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the transfer matrix , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is a matrix defined as @xmath132    let @xmath133 where @xmath134 are given by",
    ". this operator exchanges @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "applying it as a similarity transformation for @xmath137 leads to @xmath138 where @xmath139 thus , @xmath140 can be interpreted as the transfer matrix of the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model in which the interactions have been changed as follows , @xmath141 the second difference is that while in the initial ising model the four - spin interactions act on the right - hand side of the bricks , the four - spin interactions appear on their left - hand sides of the transformed model .",
    "the self - duality relation for this model is described by the equation @xmath142 where @xmath143^{\\frac{mn}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath144    unfortunately the model under consideration is a ferromagnetic one , so the phase transition in an external magnetic field does not exist .",
    "self - duality enables one only to find a number of interesting relations between correlations function for the ( 2 + 4 ) bwi model .",
    "the main goal of this paper was to find and investigate the dual model for the 2d ising model with the isotropic nearest and anisotropic next - nearest neighbor interactions on a rectangular lattice .",
    "the dual model turned out to be a 2d ising model with two - spin nearest - neighbor anisotropic interactions and additional four - spin interactions on the brick - wall lattice .",
    "the appearance of the four - spin interactions is associated with the presence of non - planar next - nearest neighbor interactions in the original model . the way we constructed",
    "the dual model is quite general , does not require the introduction of the dual lattice concept and can be applied to other ising models .",
    "investigation of the impact of the four - spin interactions on the critical temperature of the dual model revealed that while the four - spin interactions can increase the critical temperature of the model , this increase is restricted to a finite temperature range .",
    "moreover , the limits of this range are bounded by the two - spin interaction constants of the dual model .",
    "this rather unexpected result has to be analysed further , e.g.  by computer simulation , for example , using landau s approach @xcite .",
    "computer simulations are also necessary to investigate the exact location of the phase transition as well as its critical properties , including the universality class",
