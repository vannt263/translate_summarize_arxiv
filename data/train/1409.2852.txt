    "[ fig : fig_pes]b these energies are still in the part where the anharmonicity of the pes is modest .",

    "the period of this modulation is about 363 fs . in terms of the dynamics on the bond distance",
    "pes this implies that there are certain periods where the motion is essentially along @xmath10 or @xmath11 only . in other words , whereas each pulse separately would excited a collective vibration , i.e. along @xmath57 or @xmath58 , a superposition of two pulses leads to an alternating localization of the vibrational motion in the individual co bonds .",
    "the wave packet associated with this localized vibration , however , does not correspond to an eigenstate of the system .",
    "similar to the well - know problem of tunneling in a double well potential , we observe a wave packet motion between two localized vibrations with a time scale for `` switching '' of @xmath59 fs .",
    "starting around 1500 fs we notice that the localization in one coordinate is no longer perfect , i.e. the wave packet become increasingly influenced by the anharmonicity of the potential and the above relation no longer holds . during the propagation the wave packet stays rather compact ,",
    "what can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_pos_phase0]b where the standard deviation of the coordinate is plotted",
    ". moreover , the expectation values of the dissociation coordinates stay almost constant ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates that anharmonicity is still rather modest under these excitation condition .",
    "increasing the field amplitude to @xmath60 me@xmath54/ea@xmath14 more energy is absorbed by the molecular system , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig_field]a .",
    "this comes along with the exploration of the more anharmonic parts of the pes . as a consequence",
    "the wave packet dispersion is more pronounced and the simple two state superposition picture should break down . nevertheless , the weak - field behavior of alternating oscillations is still discernible from fig . [",
    "fig : fig_pos_phase0]c .",
    "notice , however , that in particular the oscillation amplitude of @xmath55 decreases .",
    "since the standard deviation increases at the same time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_pos_phase0]d ) , the delocalized wave packet is no longer well described by the coordinate expectation value , i.e. the classical picture of a vibrating bond coordinate does nt apply .    in order to rationalize this field - induced transient localization",
    ", we note that the molecule - field interaction can be written approximately as @xmath61 hence , for the choice of @xmath52 , the field effectively drives the coordinate @xmath62 , i.e. the superposition which corresponds to localized motion along @xmath11 , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig_pos_phase0 ] . for the case of the weaker field",
    "this corresponds to the excitation of a superposition of the fundamental transitions of the @xmath37 and @xmath34 modes , what explains the observed switching time .    for",
    "the alternative choice of @xmath63 degrees one would expect a driving of @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , this argument holds as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_pos_phase180]a , b .",
    "since there is not much difference in the pes concerning the two directions , a similar behavior is found upon increasing the field amplitude , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig_pos_phase180]c , d .",
    "finally , we note that the broad pulse spectra leave some flexibility concerning the actual carrier frequencies .",
    "exemplary , this has been investigated for the case where the carrier frequencies are both tuned mid - way between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 transitions .",
    "as shown in the supplementary material this does nt not result in an appreciably change of the bond oscillation pattern .",
    "the excitation conditions used in the previous section have been such that @xmath67 is well below the dissociation threshold of 20160 ( 2.5 ev ) .",
    "next , following previous work @xcite , the question will be explored whether the anharmonic coupling of the 4d pes suffices to cause bond dissociation at all . to this end",
    "the ground state wave packet will be displaced such that its center is at the positions on the pes given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_pes ] .",
    "these points have been chosen such that the expectation value of the energy is slightly above the dissociation energy , i.e. 20970 ( 2.6 ev ) .",
    "this gives the initial state for a field - free wave packet propagation .",
    "the reaction yield is calculated according to eq . .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] .",
    "apparently , the reaction yield is rather low on the time scale of 2 ps , i.e. similar to the case of the carboxymyoglobin model of ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , excitation of the carbonyl stretching coordinates , no matter whether it is collective ( i ) or localized ( ii ) does nt lead to a yield larger than @xmath510@xmath68 .",
    "simultaneous displacement along the co - co bond coordinates ( iii ) increases the yield by a factor of two .",
    "in fact , only an extreme compression of the co - co bond ( iv ) does give an appreciable reaction yield of about @xmath510@xmath69 . however , apart from the experimental constraints , driving the metal - carbonyl bond could be complicated by the fact , that in this spectral range modes that are not part of the present model would influence the dynamics , e.g. , via ivr processes .",
    "previously , we had shown that collective co vibrations in mn@xmath8(co)@xmath1 can be manipulated using circularly polarized laser pulses such that the vibrational excitation circles around the molecular axis @xcite . here , we expanded on the topic of manipulating collective carbonyl vibrations and demonstrated the effect of localization of vibrational motion , achieved by two perpendicular linearly polarized laser pulses .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) given a pair of ir active symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations , a superposition state can be excited , which corresponds to an alternating oscillation along a local bond stretching coordinate .",
    "the time for switching between the two localized vibrations is determined by the inverse of the difference between the symmetric and antisymmetric transition frequency .",
    "( ii ) by choosing the relative phase between the two overlapping pulses , the initially driven local coordinate can be determined .",
    "( iii ) the efficiency of this process diminishes with increasing excitation level due to the anharmonicity leading to wave packet dispersion .",
    "the simulations have been performed assuming that the molecule is fixed in space . in principle",
    "such condition could be realized , for instance , by immobilization on a surface . in gas phase",
    "one could resort to intricate field - driven alignment and orientation schemes such as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in solution phase",
    "one can argue that the ultrashort overlapping pulses would preferentially excite those molecules , which have the proper orientation with respect to the laser polarization directions .",
    "rotational motion during the pulses and even on the time scale considered here can certainly be neglected .",
    "of course , when it comes to experimental observation care needs to be taken of the fact that actually a distribution of differently oriented molecules will be excited . concerning the experimental signatures of the proposed transient localization we note that ashihara et al @xcite in their laser control experiment attributed an oscillatory signal in transient pump - probe spectroscopy to the creation of a coherent superposition between symmetric and antisymmetric fundamental transitions .",
    "how the present dynamics reflects in time - resolved nonlinear spectroscopy remains to be investigated .",
    "point ( iii ) above implies that this simple pulse scheme is not suitable for strong excitation of a local co bond , such that ivr can cause dissociation of the neighboring metal - carbonyl bond .",
    "whether more complicated pulse forms ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) can achieve the goal of keeping the wave packet compact even at high energies remains to be shown . in any case",
