    "throughout this paper we will frequently use the term  knot \" to mean either a knot or a link for simplicity of exposition .",
    "lomonaco and kauffman @xcite introduced a knot mosaic system to give a definition of a quantum knot system which can be viewed as a blueprint for the construction of an actual physical quantum system .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the set of the following @xmath9 symbols which are called mosaic tiles ;        [ fig0 ]    let @xmath0 be a positive integer .",
    "we define an _",
    "@xmath0-mosaic _ as an @xmath1 matrix @xmath10 of mosaic tiles with rows and columns indexed from @xmath11 to @xmath0 .",
    "knot @xmath0-mosaic _ is an @xmath0-mosaic in which each curve segment on a mosaic tile is suitably connected together on both sides with other curve segments on mosaic tiles immediately next to in either the same row or the same column . then this knot @xmath0-mosaic represents a specific knot .",
    "one natural question concerning knot mosaics may be to determine the size of matrices representing knots .",
    "define the _ mosaic number _",
    "@xmath2 of a knot @xmath3 as the smallest integer @xmath0 for which @xmath3 is representable as a knot @xmath0-mosaic .",
    "four examples of mosaics in figure [ fig1 ] are a 4-mosaic , the hopf link 4-mosaic , the trefoil knot 4-mosaic and @xmath5 6-mosaic .        as an analog to the planar isotopy moves and",
    "the reidemeister moves for standard knot diagrams , lomonaco and kauffman created for knot mosaics the @xmath9 mosaic planar isotopy moves and the mosaic reidemeister moves .",
    "they conjectured that for any two tame knots ( or links ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and their arbitrary chosen mosaic representatives @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are of the same knot type if and only if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of the same knot mosaic type .",
    "this means that tame knot theory and knot mosaic theory are equivalent .",
    "lomonaco - kauffman conjecture was proved being true by kuriya in @xcite .",
    "lomonaco and kauffman also proposed several open questions related to knot mosaics .",
    "one natural question is the following ; _ is this mosaic number related to the crossing number of a knot ? _ in this paper we establish an upper bound on the mosaic number of a knot or a link @xmath3 in terms of its crossing number @xmath4 .",
    "note that the mosaic number of the hopf link is 4 , and the prime and non - alternating @xmath5 link is 6 , even though their crossing numbers are 2 and 6 , respectively .    [ thm : main ] let @xmath3 be a nontrivial knot or a non - split link except the hopf link and the @xmath5 link .",
    "then @xmath6 .",
    "moreover if @xmath3 is prime and non - alternating , then @xmath7 .",
    "another proposed question is how many knot @xmath0-mosaics are there .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the total number of elements of all knot @xmath0-mosaics .",
    "already known is that @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "recently the authors established lower and upper bounds on @xmath16 for @xmath20 as follows in @xcite ; @xmath21",
    "there is an open - book decomposition of @xmath22 which has open half - planes as pages and the standard @xmath23-axis as the binding axis .",
    "we may regard each page as a half - plane @xmath24 at angle @xmath25 when the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane has a polar coordinate .",
    "it can be easily shown that every knot @xmath3 can be embedded in an open - book decomposition with finitely many pages so that it meets each page in a simple arc .",
    "such an embedding is called an _ arc presentation _ of @xmath3 . the _ arc index _",
    "@xmath28 is defined to be the minimal number of pages among all possible arc presentations of @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce two theorems which are crucial in the proof of the main theorem .",
    "bae and park established an upper bound on arc index in terms of crossing number .",
    "corollary @xmath29 and theorem @xmath30 in @xcite provide the following ;    [ thm : bp ] let @xmath3 be a knot or a non - split link",
    ". then @xmath31 .",
    "moreover if @xmath3 is prime and non - alternating , then @xmath32 .",
    "later jin and park improved the second part of the above theorem as theorem @xmath33 in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : jp ] let @xmath3 be a non - alternating prime knot or link",
    ". then @xmath34 .    a _ grid diagram _ is a link diagram of vertical strands and the same number of horizontal strands with the properties that at every crossing the vertical strand crosses over the horizontal strand and no two horizontal segments are co - linear and no two vertical segments are co - linear .",
    "it is known that every knot admits a grid diagram @xcite .",
    "the minimal number of vertical segments in all grid diagrams of a knot @xmath3 is called the _ grid index _ of @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "since grid diagrams are a way for depicting arc presentations @xcite , we will think of the grid index and the arc index equivalently , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "three figures in figure [ fig2 ] show an arc presentation of the trefoil knot , a grid diagram , and how they are related .",
    "note that both of the arc index and the grid index of the trefoil knot are 5 .",
    "[ h ]        dynnikov introduced the following properties of grid diagram system in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use cyclic permutations only .",
    "[ prop : d ] two grid diagrams of the same link can be obtained from each other by a finite sequence of the following elementary moves .    * cyclic permutation of horizontal ( vertical ) edges ; * stabilization and destabilization ; * interchanging neighbouring edges if their pairs of endpoints do not interleave .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be a nontrivial knot or a non - split link except the hopf link and @xmath5 link .",
    "we start with a grid diagram with the grid index @xmath35 ( which is equal to @xmath28 ) .",
    "we can regard this grid diagram as a knot mosaic representative of @xmath3 by smoothing each corner as in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this fact guarantees that @xmath37 .",
    "we distinguishes into two cases ;        * case 1 . *",
    "the grid diagram contains a non - rectangular component .",
    "we will find an upper bound on the mosaic number in terms of the arc index with the size reduced by 1 . by repeating cyclic permutations of horizontal edges properly",
    ", we may assume that the horizontal edge , say @xmath38 , on the top of this new grid diagram is a part of the non - rectangular component .",
    "note that cyclic permutations do not change the grid index .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be two vertical edges adjacent with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is longer than @xmath40 . indeed they do not have the same length , otherwise they must be parts of a rectangular component .",
    "let @xmath41 be the horizontal edge adjacent with the shorter vertical edge @xmath40 other than @xmath38 , and @xmath42 the vertical edge adjacent with @xmath41 other than @xmath40 .",
    "see figure [ fig5 ] . by repeating cyclic permutations of vertical edges properly ,",
    "we can find a grid diagram of @xmath3 such that @xmath40 lies between @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "now we slide down @xmath38 until it reaches to @xmath41 on the grid diagram , keeping that @xmath38 crosses over all vertical edges .",
    "since this sliding uses a combination of planar isotopy moves and reidemeister moves , it does not change the knot type . even though it is not a grid diagram",
    "anymore , it is still a mosaic representative of @xmath3 .",
    "finally we can delete one column of mosaic tiles which contains the vertical edge @xmath40 as the shaded region in the figure .",
    "the result is an @xmath43-mosaic representative of @xmath3 .",
    "thus we get @xmath6 , and moreover @xmath7 for a non - alternating prime @xmath3 by theorem [ thm : bp ] and theorem [ thm : jp ] .",
    "* case 2 . *",
    "all components of the grid diagram are rectangles .",
    "this means that @xmath3 is a link consisting of @xmath0 trivial knots for some positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see the inequality @xmath44 .",
    "jin , kim and ko proved the following lemma in lemma 1 and 7 in @xcite which is very useful .",
    "[ lem : link ] let @xmath45 be a link diagram with @xmath46 crossings , @xmath0 components and @xmath47 split components . then @xmath48 . furthermore if @xmath45 is a diagram with @xmath49 crossings of a non - split link , then @xmath45 is a connected sum of @xmath50 hopf links .",
    "let @xmath45 be a diagram with @xmath4 crossings of @xmath3 .",
    "by lemma [ lem : link ] , @xmath51 , and if the equality holds , then @xmath3 is a connected sum of @xmath50 hopf links .",
    "when @xmath3 has 3 components , the left mosaic representative in figure [ fig6 ] shows @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath3 has more components , then for each component the crossing number is increased by 2 and we can easily find a mosaic representative whose mosaic number is increased by 2 or less .",
    "if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 , so we have done . in the case of @xmath55 or @xmath56 , clearly @xmath52",
    "we only need to check the case where @xmath3 is prime and non - alternating .",
    "if @xmath55 , some component of @xmath45 must have a self - crossing .",
    "we can nullify the crossing without increasing the number of components .",
    "then this new diagram is again a connected sum of @xmath50 hopf links .",
    "this guarantees that the original link @xmath3 is not prime .",
    "finally we may assume that @xmath57 .",
    "each component does not have self - crossings .",
    "otherwise , there must be at least 2 self - crossings .",
    "then we can repeat the argument above to show that @xmath3 is not prime . if the diagram @xmath45 has a component with only 2 crossing points",
    ", then it must be a split link or a connected sum with the hopf link , so a non - prime link .",
    "therefore each component has at least 4 crossing points .",
    "but if one of them has more than 4 crossings , then @xmath53 . thus each component has exactly 4 crossings .",
    "since @xmath3 is non - splitting , this diagram looks like a necklace with @xmath0 rings .",
    "so we can find a mosaic representative with @xmath58 for @xmath59 as the right in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "note that if @xmath60 , then a grid diagram with 2 rectangles represents unlink or the hopf link . and if @xmath61 , only the @xmath5 link is non - alternating .",
    "in this section we will present sharper upper bounds on the mosaic number of pretzel knots and torus knots .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows a grid diagram of @xmath73 with @xmath78 with grid index @xmath79 .",
    "now we can follow the proof of the main theorem to reduce the size by 1 . moreover if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 vertical edge and @xmath81 horizontal edge do not share their endpoints .",
    "therefore we can simultaneously apply two sliding moves on the top horizontal edge and on the rightmost vertical edge as in figure [ fig8 ] .",
