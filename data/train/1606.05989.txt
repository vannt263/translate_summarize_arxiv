    "a molecular graph is a simple unweighted , undirected graph where the vertices correspond to atoms and edges correspond to the bonds between them .",
    "a topological index is a numeric quantity which depends on the topology of a molecular graph .",
    "more precisely , it is a real number @xmath3 derived from the graph @xmath0 such that for every graph @xmath4 isomorphic to @xmath0 , @xmath5 .",
    "topological indices correlates the physico - chemical properties of molecular graphs and are used for studying quantitative structure - activity ( qsar ) and structure - property ( qspr ) relationships for predicting different properties of chemical compounds and biological activities . in chemistry , biochemistry and nanotechnology ,",
    "different topological indices are found to be useful in isomer discrimination , qsar , qspr and pharmaceutical drug design .",

    "among various types of topological indices , degree based topological indices are most widely used indices and those have great applications in chemical graph theory .",
    "two of the oldest and well known topological indices are the first and second zagreb indices , which were first introduced by gutman et al . in 1972",
    "@xcite , where they have examined the dependence of the total @xmath15-electron energy on molecular structure .",

    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for some recent results on the topic . in the same paper , where zagreb indices were introduced , another topological index ,",
    "was also shown to influence total @xmath15-electron energy .",
    "this index was defined as sum of cubes of degrees of the vertices of the graph . however , this index never got attention except recently furtula et al .",
    "@xcite studied this index and establish some basic properties of this index and showed that the predictive ability of this index is almost similar to that of first zagreb index and for the entropy and acetic factor , both of them yield correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 .",
    "they named this index as  forgotten topological index \" or ",

    "transformation graphs converts the information from the original graph into new transformed structure .",
    "thus if is it possible to find out the given graph from the transformed graph , then such operation may be used to figure out structural properties of the original graph considering the transformation graphs ( for details see @xcite ) . in different mathematical literature ,",
    "several graph transformation have been considered where the vertex set of the transformed graph is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the best known type of such graphs is the total graph .",
    "the total graph @xmath23 of a graph @xmath0 is the graph whose vertex set is @xmath22 and any two vertices of @xmath23 are adjacent if and only if they are either incident or adjacent in @xmath0 @xcite . two other kinds of transformation graphs were introduced by sampathkumar in @xcite and were named as semitotal - point graph and semitotal - line graph .",
    "the semitotal - point graph of a graph @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath24 and any two vertices @xmath25 are adjacent in @xmath24 if and only if either both @xmath26 and @xmath12 are adjacent vertices in @xmath0 or one is a vertex of @xmath0 and the other is an edge of @xmath0 incident to the former .",

    ".    let @xmath33 be three variables taking values either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "wu and meng @xcite generalized the concept of total graphs to a total transformation graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in this paper",
