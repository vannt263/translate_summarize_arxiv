    "in recent years , it is widely believed that strong magnetic field could play an important role in astrophysics @xcite and high - energy physics @xcite . especially in quantum field theory , many papers have shown that external magnetic field can affect dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , which is also known as ` magnetic catalysis ' @xcite . in the massless nambu ",

    "it is clear that the external magnetic field stimulates qcd condensation , with stronger magnetic field , the the value of qcd condensation or dynamic mass is bigger . on the other hand , as temperature participating in , the temperature weakens the condensation , with higher temperature , the value of qcd condensation or dynamic mass is smaller . the effect to condensation from magnetic field and temperature",
    "are opposite , hence putting these two conditions together can lead us to study their corporate contributions to the condensation . beside that , in the chiral limit , when the temperature is high enough ( exceeding a critical value @xmath7 ) , the system shall undergo a phase transition , the broke chiral symmetry will restore , and now with the presentation of external magnetic field , @xmath7 should be relative to the magnetic field , hence one of our purpose to study the influence of magnetic field and temperature to qcd condensation is to identify the function relation of magnetic field and critical temperature .    susceptibilities and critical coefficients are important parameters to evaluate the chiral phase transition of qcd . in quantum field",

    "but in our case here , there are two reasons that we can not directly employ this conclusion , firstly , from eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) one can find in the denominator of @xmath23 , the non - commutable relation of @xmath212 and @xmath213 produces the @xmath214 term in the spinor space , secondly , the difference of electric charges of @xmath8 @xmath9 quarks produces a non - identity matrix @xmath215 in the flavor space , therefore it is hard to deduce the final gap equations for @xmath46 and @xmath209 , and @xmath209 might not have a trivial solution . in this appendix , we are going to prove that @xmath209 still can have a trivial solution .",
    "the complete propagator @xmath216 in eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) is @xmath217 in this propagator , because of the existence of @xmath218 , it is not easy to construct simple quadratic terms in the denominator .    since our purpose is to prove @xmath209 can have trivial solution , we assume it is , then replace @xmath20 into eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) , if the lhs and rhs of eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) are equal , our assumption is proved .    when @xmath20 , the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) is @xmath219 , now we are going to prove that the rhs of eq . (",
    "[ cp ] ) is also @xmath219 . for the propagator",
    ", there is @xmath220 therefor , we have @xmath221 replacing it into the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) , @xmath222=\\operatorname{tr}(i\\gamma^5\\hat s_u)-\\operatorname{tr}(i\\gamma^5\\hat s_d)=0.\\ ] ] as for @xmath223 of @xmath224 , there definitely has @xmath225=0.\\ ] ] now we have proved that with the presence of external magnetic field , we still can find trivial solution for @xmath209 .",
    "in fact this is rational , because @xmath226 in the denominator of complete fermion propagator violates parity , hence in many papers @xmath209 is set as @xmath219  @xcite .    through this conclusion ,",
    "now we are able to simplify the gap equation of @xmath46 , @xmath227    generally speaking , @xmath46 should be a @xmath228 matrix , but from previous discussion we know that the @xmath229 part ( flavor space ) is eventually simplified by the @xmath207 operator and @xmath20 , if one demands @xmath230 , then the gap equations of @xmath46 and @xmath209 will definitely not be such simple .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath231 part ( spinor space ) is simplified to scaler at the beginning in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , because @xmath46 is introduced here as an auxiliary scaler field .    actually in njl model",
    ", it is not obvious that the dynamic mass @xmath232 should be a @xmath231 matrix ( here for convenience we only consider one flavor njl model , the flavor space is neglected ) , because either mean field approximation or auxiliary field method , it provides only a scaler rather than a matrix to the dynamic mass ( or non - approximate fermion self energy ) . while in ref .",
    "@xcite s work , the authors had proposed a method to find out the matrix form of self energy , they used fierz transformation to identify the matrix structure .",
    "but in a matter of fact , the result is trivial as long as chemical potential is not involved .    instead of employing the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we use dyson - schwiger equation with contact interaction model to clarify this problem , the dyson - schwinger equation of fermion self energy is @xmath233 for the contact interaction model , the gluon propagator and dressed vertex are simplified into @xmath234 replacing them into eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , @xmath235 in eq .",
    "( [ dsc ] ) , it is @xmath236 rather than @xmath187 in the njl gap equation , this difference naturally leads to the assumption that @xmath232 is a @xmath237 spinor space matrix as long as it complies with some specific symmetry .",
    "normally @xmath232 should be @xmath238 , there is no @xmath239 and @xmath240 terms because they violate parity , there is also no @xmath241 terms because if there was , in the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ dsc ] ) , the @xmath241 terms of @xmath232 can not find corresponding terms in the rhs because @xmath242 . on the other hand , @xmath243 in @xmath232",
    "can be absorbed by @xmath244 , hence their contributions are trivial , this leaves only @xmath46 contributes to the self energy @xmath232 , therefore a @xmath232 can be simplified to a scaler .    in this article , although magnetic field has been involved , we can also prove that @xmath243 in @xmath245 is trivial , and a scaler @xmath232 is the simplest and self - consistence solution for our magnetic field case .",
    "assuming @xmath245 ( there still not has @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 terms for the same reason as mentioned above ) , from appendix a , we know @xmath246 and for the spinor matrices , there is @xmath247 hence there is @xmath248 the lhs and the rhs are both scalers , the assumption of scaler @xmath232 is reasonable .",
