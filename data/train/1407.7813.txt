    "cu@xmath12 compounds with organic cations and anions are in the focus of current research on quantum magnetism . their advantages include facile crystal growth from the solution@xcite and large cu  cu separations leading to relatively weak exchange couplings that are on the scale of feasible magnetic fields and reveal remarkable sensitivity to the applied pressure .",
    "therefore , both magnetic field and external pressure can be used to change the physical regime of the system and tune it toward a new phase or a quantum critical point .",
    "remarkable examples include the operational low - temperature magnetocaloric effect in the cu - oxalate - based compound,@xcite magnetic - field - induced ferroelectricity in sulfolane copper chloride sul - cu@xmath1cl@xmath5,@xcite and pressure - induced incommensurate magnetism in piperazinium copper chloride phcc.@xcite    despite numerous experimental studies , microscopic aspects of cu@xmath12 magnets with organic components are relatively less developed .",
    "many of these systems are easy to understand empirically , because organic molecules provide only a few linkages between the spin-@xmath8 cu@xmath12 ions , hence forming a clearly identifiable backbone of the low - dimensional magnetic unit.@xcite nevertheless , detailed understanding of the underlying exchange mechanisms is vitally important for the deliberate preparation of new compounds . moreover , as we show below , the trends in magnetic exchange through organic molecules are far from being trivial and extend our knowledge of superexchange interactions in general .    here , we consider cu(pm)(ea)@xmath1 , where ea stands for the ethylamine [ c@xmath1h@xmath3nh@xmath7^+$ ] cation , and pm is the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1(coo)@xmath2@xmath6 anion of pyromellitic acid .",
    "this newly synthesized compound features layered crystal structure , with organic anions connecting cu@xmath12 ions into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square - lattice - like network .",
    "two ea@xmath13 cations then balance the negative charge of the resulting _ anionic _ framework and reside between the layers .",
    "this type of structure is clearly reminiscent of quasi-2d magnets cu(pz)@xmath1x@xmath1 , where cu@xmath12 ions are linked through pyrazine molecules ( pz ) and form a _",
    "cationic _ framework .",
    "its charge is compensated by inorganic anions x , such as clo@xmath14 , f@xmath15 , etc.@xcite    an interesting feature of cu(pz)@xmath1x@xmath1 and related compounds is the weak frustration@xcite of their square - lattice magnetic network by second - neighbor interactions @xmath16 yielding the well - known model of the frustrated square lattice ( fsl ) that enjoys close theoretical attention and possible connections to high - temperature superconductivity in doped cu@xmath12 oxides.@xcite we thus expected that cu(pm)(ea)@xmath1 might also show the fsl physics and reveal a stronger frustration than in cu(pz)@xmath1x@xmath1 .",
    "the latter compounds feature two nearest - neighbor couplings mediated by different pyrazine molecules , so that a direct superexchange pathway for @xmath16 is missing .",
    "in contrast , both first- and second - neighbor couplings in cu(pm)(ea)@xmath1 should be mediated by the same organic molecule of the pyromellitic acid , hence an increase in @xmath16 is naturally expected .",
    "our experimental data and microscopic analysis confirm the quasi-2d nature of cu(pm)(ea)@xmath1 with a weak spatial anisotropy of in - plane magnetic couplings and a very small interlayer coupling .",
    "we do not find any signatures of the frustration , though .",
    "nevertheless , our data disclose a non - trivial mechanism of the remarkably long - range superexchange between the cu@xmath12 ions .",
    "this superexchange is mediated by the carbon atoms involved in the phenyl ring of the pyromellitic acid .",
    "its implications for other quantum magnets are discussed .",
