    "the magnetic configuration of the extended solar corona in the solar wind formation region plays an important role when considering questions related to the analyses of observed solar wind plasma characteristics and energetic particles in the heliosphere .",
    "there are no direct measurements of magnetic fields in these regions of space , and available indirect data obtained by remote sensing methods are scarce and sometimes contradictory ( see , e.g. , bird and edenhofer , 1990 ; suess , 1993 ) .",
    "theoretical models , generally numerical ones are often based on the use of potential , force - free or other mhdapproaches without the sufficient attention to real electric currents .",
    "different theoretical approaches are described in the literature ( schatten , 1971 ; gleeson and axford , 1976 ; wang , 1995 ; zhao and hoeksema , 1995 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper consists in an attempt to fill the existing gap .",
    "a simple analytical model is suggested taking into account qualitatively correctly the main observational information about the structure of the magnetic field in the extended solar corona and the heliosphere during solar minimum years , when the dipole component dominates .",
    "a model with the quadrupole term is appropriate to describe the north- south asymmetry .",
    "the crucial point in choosing the model is the requirement that it should reproduce asymptotically correct at least the rough geometrical characteristics of the global three - dimensional magnetic field known at present both near the sun and far from it .",
    "we consider the simplest model for solar minimum years , which is represented as a superposition of fields from two sources : a point magnetic dipole in the center of the sun and an extremely thin ring current sheet in the equatorial plane with the surface current density @xmath0 . the analysis made earlier ( veselovsky , 1994 ) showed that it was a such concentrated current in the heliosphere that created the magnetic field @xmath1 , @xmath3 .",
    "there emerged all supporting reasons in favor of the present model for the description of the global structure of the magnetic field due to the ulysses measurements that showed the @xmath4 constancy in the broad range of heliolatitudinal angles investigated up to @xmath5 .",
    "one can neglect the solar rotation in the inner heliosphere , where @xmath6 .",

    "the quadrupole component decreases more rapidly than the dipole component in the minimum years and at a distance of @xmath73 from the centre of the sun , the dipole component clearly dominates . as an illustration ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath74 in our calculations .",
    "the existence of an equivalent electric circuit with radial electric currents in the heliosphere was suggested by h. alfven ( 1977 ; 1981 ) .",
    "radial electric currents flowing in the heliospheric current sheet of an order of several @xmath75 are closed via volume electric currents inside the polar regions .     and",

    "azimuthal electric currents in the heliosphere are two orders of magnitude stronger .",
    "they are forming a thin ring current sheet around the sun .",
    "the lines of this surface current follow hyperbolic spirals orthogonal to the archimedian spirals of the magnetic field lines .",
    "inhomogeneous distributions of these surface currents are manifested as strong heliospheric electrojets or partial ring currents inside streamers ( veselovsky , 1994 ) .",
    "each streamer in the corona contains a ribbon with a strong horizontal current and closure currents flowing around the streamer and partially diverted to the sun along field lines of the global magnetic field .",
    "field - aligned currents arise in this case in a manner analogous to the situation with the partial ring current in the earth s night - side magnetosphere .",
    "the streamer belt consists , as a rule , of several strong partial streamers and multiple weaker entities .",
    "hence , the system of inhomogeneous in - flowing and out - flowing field - aligned electric currents appears in both magnetic hemispheres , which should be partially conjugated along global magnetic field lines .",
    "it is important to note , that the main free magnetic energy of the heliosphere is accumulated and available for transformations inside the heliospheric current sheet and its closure currents which are mainly field - aligned .",
    "we have considered the simple analytical model of the magnetic configuration of the extended solar corona in the solar wind formation region . the model is represented by the superposition of the known asymptotics at the small and the large distances from the sun . during the years of low solar activity the overall geometry near the sun in the solar corona is dominated by the large - scale field of the sun .",
    "it is mainly represented by the magnetic dipole slightly or moderately inclined against the solar rotation axis , and the magnetic field of the thin heliospheric current sheet situated near the magnetic equator .",
    "the dipole inclination increases with the solar cycle activity phase .",
    "quadrupole and higher harmonics and nonstationary perturbations are especially important during higher solar activity years .",
    "the strength of the heliospheric current sheet increases and its geometry is more complicated during this period of time .",
    "the overall oblate and curved shape of the minimal corona and more spherical and radial maximal structures are related to the evolution of the electric current inside and outside the sun with the solar cycle .",
