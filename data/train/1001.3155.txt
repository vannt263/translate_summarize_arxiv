    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop is an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath2 gauge theories without fermions @xcite since @xmath3 symmetry is broken in the deconfined phase . at large @xmath4",
    "the phase transition becomes a strong first - order phase transition @xcite and the polyakov loop jumps from zero to a finite value at @xmath5 ( which is also known as the gross - witten point @xcite ) .",
    "we define the path - ordered polyakov loop as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the non - abelian gauge field operator and the trace is over the fundamental representation of @xmath2 . according to the equation above",
    ", the loop can be seen as the trace of the propagator of an infinitely heavy quark in imaginary time . a less abstract way to understand",
    "this operator involves the connection between the loop and the free energy of a single , isolated ( and infinitely massive ) heavy quark in the medium @xcite @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 thus , in the confined phase of @xmath2 yang - mills ( ym ) theories the free energy diverges ( because of wilson s area law ) and @xmath10 then vanishes .",
    "if dynamical fermions are added then @xmath10 is small but nonzero in the hadronic phase because @xmath11 pairs can be created thermally .",
    "the loop in qcd was computed in perturbative theory a long time ago and the leading correction to its asymptotic value ( which is unity because of asymptotic freedom ) is _ positive _ and of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this implies that in perturbation theory @xmath10 approaches unity from above .",
    "we will show in this paper that gauge theories with gravity duals that can mimic the current lattice predictions for the thermodynamics of pure glue can also describe @xmath10 .",
    "because of cluster decomposition , @xmath10 can also be obtained from the disconnected piece of the polyakov loop correlator @xmath13 which is assumed to give the free energy , @xmath14 , associated with a heavy @xmath11 pair separated by a distance @xmath15 in the medium ( for a recent review of quarkonia at finite temperature see @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge / string duality states that the complicated non - abelian dynamics of four dimensional gauge theories can be understood in terms of the physics of higher dimensional theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "this duality establishes that when the gauge theory is strongly - coupled the corresponding gravitational description is weakly - coupled , which makes this whole idea hard to falsify . however , there is in fact enough evidence that the main ideas behind this conjecture are right @xcite .",
    "the most well studied example of this correspondence is the duality between 4-dimensional @xmath16 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) and type iib string theory on @xmath17 @xcite . in this case , the gauge theory at large @xmath4 is in the regime of strong thooft coupling @xmath18 and the typical  stringy \" coupling in the gravitational theory is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the string length and @xmath21 is the radius of @xmath22 .",

    "note that the boundary of @xmath22 is a flat 4d spacetime .",
    "also , because in ym the only degrees of freedom are adjoint gluons , no other adjoint scalar fields in the gauge theory are included here and our working assumption is that the gravity dual theory may be properly defined in a 5 dimensions at least when it comes to the observables discussed in this paper .",

    "note that even though the gravity calculations performed here require that @xmath56 to avoid loop corrections , a comparison of our results to lattice data is still meaningful because , apart from a trivial rescaling , the thermodynamic properties of pure glue at @xmath57 and @xmath58 are very similar , as shown in @xcite .",

    "when @xmath59 and the radius of the background spacetime is much larger than the string length , an infinitely massive excitation in the fundamental representation of @xmath2 in the gauge theory at finite temperature is dual to a classical string in the bulk that goes from a probe d - brane at the boundary and to the black brane horizon @xcite .",

    "the disconnected contribution to the correlator in theories such as ( [ dilatonaction ] ) can be computed as follows . using the gauge choice @xmath70 where the string endpoints at the boundary are at @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the regularized free energy of a single ( static ) heavy quark ( up to a @xmath23 independent constant ) above @xmath5 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a positive - defined function of @xmath75 that is regular at the horizon .",

    "moreover , for confining gravity duals the magnitude of the jump in @xmath10 at @xmath5 is determined by how quickly @xmath89 at @xmath90 . in the case of a first - order transition",
    "it can be shown explicitly that the thermal width of heavy quarkonia at strong coupling derived in @xcite vanishes below @xmath5 .",
    "continuous transitions where @xmath10 smoothly interpolates between zero and its high - t limit , such as the one that occur in qcd with dynamical fermions @xcite , can also be obtained depending on the choice for @xmath32 .",
    "because of our choice for @xmath77 , the medium is always in the deconfined phase and @xmath10 can be evaluated at any @xmath23 using ( [ dfdt1 ] ) and there is no jump at @xmath5 .",

    "( [ dfdt1 ] ) and , because of the regularization , @xmath91 is determined only up to a constant whose value is chosen via a match to the lattice data at @xmath92 ( the first data point above @xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath93 ) for a given choice of @xmath94 .",
    "our results for the renormalized polyakov loop are shown in fig .  2 ( with @xmath95 ) and one can see they agree very well with the lattice calculations from @xcite between @xmath96 . at higher temperatures the curve starts to considerably deviates from the data .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the gauge theory considered here is not asymptotically free .    ) and ( [ potential ] ) and the lattice data for quenched qcd with @xmath93 ( red ) and @xmath97 ( blue ) from ref .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to describe the current lattice data for the thermodynamics and also the expectation value of the polyakov loop of quenched su(3 ) qcd using gravity duals where conformal invariance is softly broken by the presence of a nontrivial scalar field . the match gets worse as the temperature is increased , which may be a consequence of the fact that the theories considered here flow to a nontrivial fixed point ( conformal invariance is restored when @xmath98 but the system is still strongly interacting ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study examples where the gauge theory is confining @xcite and also investigate the properties of the polyakov loop and its correlator in this case .",
    "note that in order to match the lattice data of the loop @xmath99 , which indicates that higher - order derivative corrections @xcite to the gravity dual are probably going to be important in this type of analysis .",
    "these corrections were used in @xcite to study the dependence of @xmath10 with the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath100 , in superconformal strongly - coupled gauge theories . it would be interesting to extend this analysis to non - conformal gauge theories as well . in this case ,",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath10 will be temperature dependent and one could obtain how @xmath101 varies with @xmath10 at strong thooft coupling ( this was computed at weak coupling in @xcite ) .",
