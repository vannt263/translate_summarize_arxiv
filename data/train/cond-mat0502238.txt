    "usually the fermi surface respects the point - group symmetry of the underlying lattice structure . in principle , however , electron - electron interactions can drive a fermi surface deformation that breaks the orientational symmetry of the system .",
    "recently , the possibility of symmetry - breaking fermi surface deformations with a @xmath0-wave order parameter , where the surface expands along the @xmath1-axis and shrinks along the @xmath2-axis ( or vice versa ) , was discussed for various two - dimensional electron models on a square lattice : @xmath5-@xmath6,@xcite hubbard,@xcite and extended hubbard@xcite model .",

    "in particular , we show that in the weak coupling limit fermi surface symmetry breaking is characterized by a single energy scale , which leads to universal behavior in terms of suitably rescaled parameters .",
    "furthermore , we show that the tricritical points can be suppressed to lower temperatures by a uniform repulsion added to the original f - model , which , for a particularly favorable but not unphysical choice of hopping and interaction parameters , can even lead to a quantum critical point . finally , we find that the @xmath0-wave compressibility of the fermi surface is usually strongly enhanced along the transition line down to zero temperature even if the transition is first order , which implies that the fermi surface is already very soft at the transition and fluctuations should be important .",
