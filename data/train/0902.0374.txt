    "in the last few decades , density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite has grown to be a widely used method for studying the ground - state properties of interacting many - electron systems and the range of its applications has been expanding .",
    "an important generalization of dft , which takes into account the orbital effects of an external magnetic field , is the non - relativistic _ current density functional theory _ ( cdft ) , which was formulated by vignale and rasolt ( vr )  @xcite in the late eighties .",
    "the basic variable of that theory ( in addition to the usual particle and spin densities ) is the _",
    "paramagnetic current density _",
    "@xmath1 , which has the following advantages upon the  physical current density \" @xmath2 : ( i ) it has no explicit dependence on the external vector potential  a property it shares with previous relativistic formulations  @xcite , and ( ii ) it does not vanish in the limit of uniform density and magnetic field , which is vital to the construction of a local density approximation ( lda ) . unfortunately @xmath3 is not a gauge - invariant variable .",
    "vr ensured the gauge invariance of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy by expressing the latter in terms of the vorticity [ vrvorticity ] : = , which _ is _ gauge invariant .",
    "while this choice is not unique ( any gauge - invariant field which is in one - to - one correspondence to the vorticity would be in principle admissible ) , it was shown to be the most natural one , in the sense of leading to a local description of the effect of the magnetic field in the quasi - homogeneous limit .    in extending their theory to spin polarized systems,@xcite",
    "vr proved the analogue of the hohenberg - kohn theorem for paramagnetic spin - currents , and observed that the xc energy @xmath4  now a functional of paramagnetic spin currents  should be invariant under local u(1 ) @xmath0 su(2 ) gauge transformations .",
    "these are transformations in which the wave function is acted upon by the position - dependent operator @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is a matrix in two - dimensional spin space . however , the behavior of the paramagnetic spin currents under these transformations is quite complicated and vr were unable to identify a variable analogous to the vorticity , such that an @xmath4 functional of this variable would be manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "recently , bencheikh  @xcite and grling  @xcite have further extended spin - cdft to incorporate spin - orbit ( so ) interactions .",
    "these interactions are naturally described in terms of su(2 ) gauge potentials , i.e. , vector potentials that are matrices in spin space .    in ref .",
    "it was noticed that in many realistic situations the su(2 ) vector potential produced by the so coupling has a nonvanishing covariant curl , which is equivalent to the presence of a non - abelian magnetic field .",
    "this effective magnetic field generates  diamagnetic \" spin currents in the ground state of molecules and solids with non - negligible so interaction . in spite of the fact that the ground state spin current is hard to detect experimentally ,",
    "its inclusion into the set of basic variables of dft is important to correctly account for the corresponding contribution to the energetics .",
    "su(2 ) gauge potentials also appear in effective hamiltonians for spin - transfer torque systems  @xcite , and in pseudospin - orbit coupled systems like graphene  @xcite .",
    "bencheikh derived the form of the kohn - sham equation in terms of effective u(1 ) @xmath0 su(2 ) gauge potentials , both expressed as functional derivatives of a gauge - invariant @xmath4 . but again , no explicitly su(2)-invariant expression for @xmath4 was provided . while the main challenge of cdft is to construct practical approximations for the xc functional , such as the exact - exchange current- and spin - current density functionals recently developed in refs .   and  , we believe it is of fundamental importance to know how to construct manifestly gauge - invariant xc functionals of the spin - current densities",
    ".    in this paper we present a solution to this problem .",
    "first we note that both the external scalar @xmath7 and vector @xmath8 potentials and the so terms can be combined into a u(1)@xmath0su(2 ) four - vector gauge potential , collectivelly denoted by @xmath9 , in such a way that the exact many - body hamiltonian becomes invariant under local u(1)@xmath0su(2 ) gauge transformations .",
    "this leads to the next key observation that the ground state energy @xmath10 depends on @xmath9 only through the invariant field strength @xmath11 $ ] , defined as the  su(2)-invariant curl \" of @xmath9 : all these quantities will be defined precisely below .",
    "@xmath12 is invariant under su(2 ) rotations in spin space and transforms as a pseudo - vector in the ordinary space , so we can write [ exca ] e[]=|e [ ] . where @xmath13 is a scalar functional of @xmath12 .",
    "notice that in the familiar spinless case @xmath9 reduces to the usual vector potential @xmath8 and @xmath12 reduces to the magnetic field @xmath14 , so the above equation simply says that the energy is a functional of the magnetic field .",
    "we will show below that the quantity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the paramagnetic particle / spin currents and @xmath17 is the particle / spin density ( again , precise definitions will be given below ) , behaves under u(1 ) @xmath0 su(2 ) gauge transformations precisely like the gauge potential @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests a path to constructing a gauge - invariant xc energy functional @xmath4 .",
    "let us introduce the  su(2)-invariant vorticity \" [ vorticity ] : = , which is the  su(2)-invariant curl \" of @xmath18 and will be shown to reduce to the vr vorticity  ( [ vrvorticity ] ) in the spinless case . since @xmath15 transforms as @xmath9 it is evident that @xmath19 is invariant under su(2 ) rotations in spin space , just as @xmath11 $ ] is .",
    "therefore , the gauge invariance of @xmath4 will be guaranteed if we write it as a scalar functional of the su(2)-invariant vorticity ( hereafter abbreviated as",
    " invariant vorticity \" ) : [ excj ] e_xc[_p ] = |e_xc [ ] ( the dependence on particle and spin density is left implicit  see concluding section ) .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath19 is of course very complex and nonlocal . the test of usefulness of eq .",
    "( [ excj ] ) is whether there are limiting cases in which the @xmath4 functional can naturally be cast in this form .",
    "we will show that this is the case .",
    "namely , in the important limit of electron gas subjected to _ uniform and weak _",
    "su(2 ) potentials the xc energy can be written as a quadratic local functional of the invariant vorticity .",
    "remarkably , in this regime the invariant vorticity is a quadratic functional of the spin currents themselves , not of their derivatives .",
    "this opens the way to a genuine lda , completely different in character from the local approximation of refs .",
    "and   in which the xc energy depended on derivatives of the paramagnetic current and/or density .",
    "the leading contribution to the present lda functional goes as the fourth power of the spin current , and the xc potentials are proportional to its third power .",

    "finally , section  [ cncl ] summarizes our main conclusions .",

    "( [ defvlink ] ) ) , which are vital to the definition of the invariant vorticity .",
    "this is at odds with spinless cdft , in which the use of the paramagnetic current density as a basic variable is , in a sense , optional .",

    "even more striking is the fact that the paramagnetic spin current must necessarily enter the construction of a nonlocal su(2)-invariant functional of the _ spin density_. in other words , such a functional must be constructed in terms of the invariant spin density @xmath153 of eq .",
    "( [ invariants ] ) , rather than the ordinary spin density .",
    "the physical reason for this is that su(2 ) symmetry can not be maintained without the introduction of su(2 ) vector potentials , which in turn modify the paramagnetic spin current densities .",
    "a truly su(2)-invariant nonlocal spin dft must necessarily be a spin - current dft .",
    "even if we stop at the  semi - local \" level , e.g. by doing a gradient expansion in the spin density , su(2 ) invariance requires that the gradients be replaced by covariant gradients , which are most naturally defined in terms of the connection @xmath154 .",
    "another possibility is to resort to functionals of spin - orbitals , which can be su(2 ) invariant without explicitly involving spin currents .    in spite of the formal progress",
