    "over the past half - century , the equations of thermoelasticity have drawn a lot of attention both from the side of mathematical and physical communities . starting with the late 50-s and early 60-s of the last century , the necessity of a rational physical description for elastic deformations of solid bodies accompanied by thermal stresses motivated the more prominent mathematicians , physists and engineers to focus on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) . as a consequence , many theories emerged , mainly in the cross - section of ( non - linear ) field theory and thermodynamics , making it possible for the equations of thermoelasticity to be interpreted as an anelastic modification of the equations of elasticity ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "both linear and nonlinear models and solution theories were proposed .",

    "even an exponential stability result for equations ( [ dafermos_thermoelasticity_pde_1])([dafermos_thermoelasticity_pde_2 ] ) under all `` reasonable '' boundary condition was shown by hansen in @xcite .    in his work @xcite",
