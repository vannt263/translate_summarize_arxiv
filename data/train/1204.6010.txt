    "the properties of rubbers and plastics can be efficiently tuned by dispersing micro or nanosized additives ( fillers ) in the polymer matrix .",
    "properties that can be influenced include rheology @xcite , mechanical @xcite , electrical @xcite and optical @xcite properties .",
    "in particular , the mechanical reinforcement induced by micro fillers in rubbery and glassy materials has been known empirically ( and exploited at an industrial level ) for many years @xcite . in polymer nanocomposites ( pnc ) , the size of the fillers is reduced down to the nanoscale and becomes comparable with the size of the polymers or even of their monomers .",
    "however , the exact physical mechanisms leading to mechanical reinforcement have proven elusive . recently , intensive experimental @xcite and computational @xcite efforts have been devoted to answering this fundamental question with the aim to get to better design of reinforced materials .",
    "many parameters play a role : the size and shape of the fillers , the polymer molecular mass and the presence of an entangled network , the strength of the physical and/or chemical interaction between the fillers and the polymers , the filler loading and dispersion .",
    "+ in this report , we focus on the issue of a polymer nanocomposite undergoing tensile tests , leading to mechanical failure .",
    "we model the pnc in a regime of strong polymer - filler interactions and optimal degree of dispersion @xcite .",
    "fillers are small if compared to the radius of gyration of the chains .",
    "their diameter varies from being equal to the monomer diameter , to being twice as large . in this regime ,",
    "the smallest fillers are known to achieve the highest degree of reinforcement @xcite .",
    "the ability of the small fillers to induce toughening has to be partly attributed to their large surface to volume ratio , which allows for the formation of a large number of strong polymer - filler bonds .",
    "but , as we show here , surface area alone is not enough to explain the filler size dependence of the pnc mechanical response .",
    "there are other factors that need to be considered for a full explanation .",
    "+ fillers affect the pnc dynamics , as well , with possible repercussions on the mechanical properties of the composite .",
    "experimental results analyzing mobility in pnc have suggested that the diffusion processes in pnc are far more complex than in pure polymers .",
    "for example , non - monotonic trends of chain diffusion coefficients vs. loading have been very recently observed experimentally in pnc containing both carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles @xcite , but no microscopic explanation is currently available . for smaller fillers ,",
    "gersappe @xcite proposed that the reinforcement mechanism is based on the dissipation of deformation energy offered by the high mobility of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix . +",
    "in order to clarify which are the structural and dynamical contributions to reinforcement , we study here the correlation between mechanical toughening , structural configuration and dynamics of the pnc .",
    "we find that the mechanical reinforcement , quantified by the stress at failure , is positively correlated with the creation of a network of numerous and strong polymer - filler bonds .",
    "small fillers , whose size is comparable to the size of the polymer monomers , are the most effective at creating such a network .",
    "concerning mobility , the toughening is correlated to the minimization of the diffusion of the fillers with respect to the polymer matrix .",
    "we do not find any evidence for dissipation effects as proposed by gersappe @xcite .",
    "our results are based on molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a polymer melt containing 64 chains , each one composed by 64 beads , and a variable number of spherical filler particles .",

    "the small filler ( sf ) is as large as the chain monomer and has the same mass , while the medium and large fillers ( mf and lf , respectively ) have size 1.3@xmath14 and 1.9@xmath14 , their masses scaling accordingly to their volumes .",
    "values of @xmath14 for polymer - filler lennard - jones interactions were chosen as the arithmetic average between the @xmath14 of the polymer and that of the filler .",
    "the addition of fillers strongly interacting with the polymer chains has the effect to increase the density of the composite , whose value depends on the filler size and concentration . for example , for the sample containing 21% sf , the density increases to 870 kg / m3 .",

    "this is questionable , as the time scale of the mechanical deformation in simulations is much shorter than the diffusion time scale . to this end",
    ", we plot the relative mobility , namely the ratio between the diffusion coefficient of the fillers and that of the polymers , @xmath39 , in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : diff ] .",
    "the relative mobility does not have a positive correlation with the stress at failure . at low loadings , relative mobility decreases while the stress at failure increases for all the filler sizes considered . in the 15 - 25% loading range , the sf and mf systems have comparable relative mobilities , but the sf system is remarkably tougher ( see fig . [",
    "fig : stressstrain ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relative mobility does not have a monotonic dependence on loading and , at least for the sf in the loading range considered , it exhibits a clear minimum .",
    "such a minimum corresponds to the maximum value for the stress at failure of the sf nanocomposite , which sets to 700 mpa in the 21 - 31% loading range and is lower elsewhere .",
    "+      these results suggest to go back to structural sources of reinforcement , and in particular to an analysis of the structure of the polymer network as it is formed via the formation of strong polymer - filler contacts .",
    "let us look at the filler - filler radial distribution functions . at 8% loading , as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] , no filler - filler contacts are formed in the matrix .",
    "the first peak of the rdf roughly corresponds , for all filler sizes considered , to bridging @xcite configurations . in such configurations , the fillers self - organize around polymer chains , in such a way that their first filler - filler neighbors are found only one polymer bead apart .",
    "this arrangement maximizes the strong polymer - filler contacts .",
    "it is then interesting to observe how rdf peaks evolve with loading . for small fillers ,",
    "the bridging peak reaches a maximum at 15% loading .",
    "then , the peak corresponding to neighboring sf particles begins to be populated . at 31%",
    "loading the two peaks are roughly equivalent and at 39% the neighboring peak is the highest .",
    "this trend is correlated to our mechanical and dynamical indicators .",
    "between 15% and 31% loading , in fact , the sf - loaded nanocomposites exhibit the largest stress at failure , while the filler mobility relative to the polymer matrix is suppressed .",
    "31% loading marks an inversion of the tendency for all of our mechanical , dynamical and structural indicators : the stress at failure decreases ; the relative mobility of the sf increases ; the number of weak filler - filler contacts becomes comparable to the number of bridging configurations . + despite the smaller number of mf in the systems , it is again at 15% loading that the bridging peak reaches its maximum and then starts decreasing , in favor of the formation of the neighbor fillers peak . at 39%",
    "a shoulder corresponding to second mf neighbors appears , as well .",
    "medium fillers are thus much less efficient in creating bridging configurations , and the overall response to strain is weaker than in the sf case . as for the lf ,",
    "the pnc is much less crowded and the bridging peak maximum sets at 31% loading .",
    "+ as a further structural indicator , we can count the number of different chains the nanofillers are , on average , in contact with .",
    "we thus consider multiple contacts between the same chain and a np as a single bridging link , and then evaluate the average number of bridging links per filler .",
    "fillers with a large surface area are expected to be more effective , namely to be able to create more bridging links than the fillers with small surface area .",
    "still , if we normalize by @xmath40 , sf turn out to be the best at exploiting their surface area , namely @xmath41 .",

    "such a structural configuration is correlated to a dynamical feature , namely the minimization of the relative mobility of the fillers with respect to the polymer matrix .",
