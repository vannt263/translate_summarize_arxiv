    "it is widely believed that at sufficiently high temperatures and densities there is a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition between normal nuclear matter and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , where quarks and gluons are no longer confined in hadrons@xcite@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the study of the qcd phase transition is supported by the heavy - ion collisions in laboratories at ultrarelativistic energies , such as the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "these conducted experiments provide us with a chance to create a hot qcd matter and elucidate its properties . in order to explore of a wider range of the qcd phase transition up to several times of the normal nuclear matter density , the new facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at darmstadt",
    ", the nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) at the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) in dubna and the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) at jaea and kek , will make such extreme conditions possible through collisions@xcite .    on the theoretical side , due to the property of confinement , in nonperturbative regime of large distances , or equivalently low energies , the analytical as well as numerical methods",
    "have not been developed enough to fulfill the solution of low - energy nonperturbative cases , especially if the baryons are involved .",
    "therefore the challenge to nuclear physicists is to find models which can bridge the gap between the fundamental theory and our wealth of knowledge about low energy phenomenology , and these models should be successful in explaining empirical facts at low energies , for example , the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and the confinement , which are both intimately related to the nonperturbative structure of the qcd vacuum .    the linear sigma model ( lsm)@xcite for the phenomenology of qcd has been proposed to describe the vacuum structure with incorporating chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "this model has two charming features according to two distinct low - energy phenomena .",
    "on the one hand , if we assume the thermal medium is mimicked by a uniform constituent quark medium with a dynamically generated mass , the model can be used to describe a restoration of the chiral symmetry at finite temperature and density in satisfactory agreement with the lattice calculations@xcite@xcite and of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model as well@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "starting from the same lagrangian , bound states ( chiral solitons ) of valence quarks can be constructed through the interaction with @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons@xcite , and the nucleon naturally arises as a non - topological chiral soliton in the model .",
    "moreover , the model has proven to be a successful approach to the description of nucleon static properties in vacuum@xcite .",
    "combining these two features together by requiring a soliton embedded in the hot soup of constituent quarks , the model seems to provide a suitable working scheme to simultaneously study both the restoration of chiral symmetry and the possible dissolution of the soliton , which simulates the delocalization ( or deconfinement in some literatures ) transition of nuclear matter to quark matter .",
    "thus such a chiral soliton model is obviously more advantageous than other nontopological soliton models@xcite@xcite@xcite in the description of the hadron - quark phase transition@xcite @xcite .    using this model ,",
    "the nucleon as a @xmath6 chiral soliton in a cold quark medium has been investigated in ref@xcite . in their studies ,",
    "the nucleon is treated as a chiral soliton of the lsm , whereas the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are chosen to be the medium - modified meson values within the njl model .",
    "for finite temperature , more recently , by adopting the one - loop phenomenological mesonic potential@xcite and the coherent - pair approximation@xcite@xcite , abu - shady and mansour have studied nucleon properties at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "since the equally one - loop contribution of the quarks in potential is ignored , their studies can not be applied to finite density directly . in order to get a full picture of hadron - quark phase transition either at finite temperature or finite density , in present work , in mean field approximation",
    ", we are going to investigate the nucleon properties as well as the thermodynamics of the system at finite temperature and density . as we know the njl model and the lsm",
    "treat the contribution of the dirac sea differently , in the njl model it is included explicitly up to a momentum cutoff @xmath10 , while in the lsm this contribution is renormalized out .",
    "so that different from the chiral soliton in the njl model@xcite@xcite , the present model has the benefit of renormalizability .",
    "eventually , such a model would be investigated beyond mean field by the loop expansion , especially by using the cjt effective potential@xcite@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we introduce the chiral soliton model with two quark flavors , nucleon static properties in the vacuum are briefly discussed and parameters are fixed . then in mean field approximation , the chiral soliton solutions of the model at different temperatures and densities are self - consistently solved in sect .",
    "section iv is devoted to study static properties of nucleon at finite temperature and density , but we leave the study of the hadron - quark phase transition until section v. at the end , we give discussions and summary in sec.vi .",

    "in many of these models , at large radius @xmath60 , the @xmath4 field assumes its vacuum value @xmath61 , but at small @xmath60 , the @xmath4 field has a value close to the second minimum of the potential near zero .",
    "it means that in physical vacuum state , the quark mass is more than @xmath62 which makes it energetically unfavorable for the quark to exist freely , so that the effective heavy quarks have to be confined in hadron bags .",

    "this method is somewhat similar to the method presented in ref@xcite by introducing a different chemical potential for the soliton , since the effects of the first term in eq.([density ] ) can be totally absorbed to the second term by redefining the chemical potential @xmath116 . but",
    "this leads to some difficulties if the different chemical potential @xmath117 is included .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath117 as a homogeneous chemical potential in space , a finite fraction of the baryon number is homogeneously spread outside the soliton , such a soliton is spatially unlimited . on the contrary",
    ", if we take @xmath117 as a space - dependent chemical potential , the standard way to derive the thermodynamical potential presented above is going to break down .",
    "so that , in this work , we prefer to choose the scheme by fixing the baryon number of the soliton to one through the modification of the normalization condition equation .",
    "in order to gain the chiral soliton solutions and study nucleon static properties at finite temperature and density , the appropriate boundary conditions for the equations of motion in thermal medium need to be defined . as the case in vacuum ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are taken as time - independent , classical @xmath39-number fields , also we require they can only differ from their expectation values in the neighborhood of the quark sources .",
    "therefore , in the absence of the quark source term for large @xmath60 , the equations ( [ equation5 ] ) and ( [ equation6 ] ) reduce to the gap equations@xcite    @xmath118    with spontaneously broken symmetry , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",

    "another interesting result displayed in fig.[fig06 ] is that the maximal radius @xmath100 at various densities are almost same when @xmath79 near @xmath127 , this hints that solitons get to overlap each other with the similar expansion rate at @xmath127 for different densities .",
    "in previous section we have obtained the effective nucleon mass at finite temperature and density , for convenience , we set @xmath134 in the following discussions . in this section",

    ", the hadronic phase exhibits a dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and the confinement , and the baryon and meson act as the active degrees of freedom here .",

    "based on the chiral soliton model , in hadron phase , the free quarks is not the ground state of strongly interacting matter , whereas three valence quarks will form the bound state of the nucleon , then in hadron phase we only have baryons and mesons . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath3 , the solitons are going to dissolve , then the hadronic phase will eventually evolve to quark phase . in the mean time ,",
    "when incorporated with the polyakov - loop , the model can be used to describe thermodynamic properties of qgp satisfactorily@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "since there is no nucleon in quark phase , all information of the system is contained in the grand canonical potential which is given by @xmath135 in eq.([potential ] ) with the restoration of chiral symmetry , and the pressure of system is directly given by @xmath136 .",
    "however , in the hadronic phase , the situation becomes a little complicated because the system should be considered as a collection of nuclear matter ( solitons ) interacted through the self - consistent exchange of @xmath4 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 mesons .",
    "moreover , in the spirit of the relativistic mean - field theory ( rmf)@xcite or the quark meson coupling model ( qmc)@xcite@xcite , one can investigate the medium modifications of nucleon properties in nuclear matter and finite nuclei extensively@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is out of the scope of our topic and left for future study . in following ,",
    "we merely give an idealistical analysis on this topic by taking the hadronic phase as a noninteracting hadron gas composed of nucleons and @xmath5 , @xmath4 mesons with the effective masses @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 in thermal medium . under this scenario ,",

    "all curves show rapidly changed discontinuities at the critical temperature from hadron matter to quark matter .",
    "this indicates a first order phase transition for both the chiral phase transition and the delocalization transition , and signals a drastic structural changes in the system . besides this discovery",
    ", we can find that the @xmath156s in the hadronic phase are quite small when compared with those of quark phase , especially , for the case of higher baryon densities .",
    "the results can be reflected by the qualitative behaviors of the hadron masses changing with the temperature at various chemical potentials . from fig.[fig05 ]",
    ", it is shown that the effective nucleon mass @xmath139 slightly deviates from its vacuum value with temperature increasing , only at the critical temperature @xmath127 , @xmath139 experiences a sharp jump to zero .",
    "consequently , the contribution of nucleons to the total pressure in eq.([pressure ] ) is very small in hadron phase as far as the chemical potential is small . for estimate",
    ", it only gives @xmath157 contribution to @xmath156 when @xmath79 is around @xmath158 mev and @xmath159 is zero .",
    "however , with the increasing of the chemical potential @xmath159 , the contribution of nucleons to the total pressure @xmath156 will become more and more important .",
    "the legend can be explained by following two major facts .",
    "one is that , from eq.([pressure ] ) , the absolute values of the first and second terms in eq.([pressure ] ) will be enhanced if we increase the chemical potential , so do the absolute values of the pressure contributed from nucleons .",
    "the other is that , from fig.[fig07 ] , since the minimum masses of sigma meson become larger and larger as @xmath159 increasing , the absolute values of the pressure contributed from mesons will decrease accordingly . for illustration ,",
    "the calculated ratio of the pressure contributed from nucleons to the total one raises up to @xmath160 when @xmath155 as @xmath79 is around @xmath161 mev , though , in the mean time , the total pressure is less than that of zero chemical potential case .",
    "the situation happened in the case of baryons can also be applied for the last term @xmath146 in eq.([pressure ] ) . for zero and very small chemical potential @xmath159 ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath146 to the total pressure @xmath156 only occupied a small part of the total pressure , e.g. , as temperature around @xmath127 for @xmath154 , the calculated ratio of the pressure contributed from @xmath146 to the total pressure is only about @xmath162 as @xmath163 . but with the increasing of the chemical potential @xmath159",
    ", the @xmath146 would give out a dominant contribution to the total pressure @xmath156 .",
    "for example , when the temperature is around @xmath164 mev for @xmath155 mev , the calculated ratio of the pressure contributed from @xmath146 to the total pressure is up to @xmath165 as @xmath166 .    in a whole",
    ", the numerically calculated pressures by treating the hadronic phase as a noninteracting hadron gas in hadronic phase are very different from that of the rmf theory at finite temperature and density@xcite@xcite , where the interactions between hadrons can further reduce the effective masses of nucleons in medium to lower than half of their values in free space . in order to confront the results in rmf theory in hadron phase",
    ", the model needs to be improved accordingly by including the interactions of nucleons and mesons with medium - modified coupling constants at hadron level@xcite@xcite , or more practically , considering the possible overlap of nucleons .",
    "we believe that these effects will modify the pressures contributed from nucleons and @xmath146 dramatically . in the present work , however , we simply take this as a shortcoming of the simple model in the description of nuclear matter .",
    "we have studied the modification of the nucleon properties due to the restoration of the chiral symmetry at finite temperature and density within the linear sigma model with two flavor .",
    "the nucleon appears as a chiral soliton in the model , which is embedded in a thermal medium of constituent quarks with self - consistently determined effective mass .",
    "the chiral soliton solutions are solved in the mean - field approximation with the restriction to hedgehog configurations .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath80 dependent energy of the single soliton is obtained .",
    "the only two free parameters @xmath13 and @xmath9 are fixed in order to describe the properties of nucleon in vacuum successfully .",
    "the stabilities of the soliton solutions are analysed in thermal medium by comparing the effective mass of nucleon with the energy of three free constituent quarks .",
    "our results show that the chiral phase transition and the delocalization phase transition from nucleon matter to quark matter take place simultaneously . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the free constituent quarks are not the ground state of strongly interacting matter , the quarks will develop to form lower - energy bound states carrying the hedgehog configuration .",
    "however , as soon as the temperature @xmath79 crosses over the @xmath127 , such bound states can not live anymore , then the system experiences a first - order hadron - quark phase transition to the chirally symmetric phase .    in this work ,",
    "we predict @xmath127 is about @xmath129 mev for @xmath110 mev , but @xmath130 mev for @xmath126 mev .",
    "it is much lower than the lattice predictions in the range of @xmath167 mev .",
    "these relatively lower critical temperatures are because of choosing a relative lager coupling constant @xmath13 which has the functions of making the soliton stable as well as best fitting the proton charge r.m.s radius to @xmath168 fm within the empirical parameter space of @xmath9 . to overcome this flaw",
    ", we can introduce the gluon interaction in the model at quark level , for example , the polyakov - loop extension of the model@xcite . for roughly and qualitatively estimate , assuming the polyakov loop variable @xmath169 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath170 approach to their expectation values as @xmath171 , then we can solve the coupled equations of motion again to get the updated behaviors of the @xmath61 as a function @xmath79 and @xmath80 . by taking the polyakov loop potential in ref.@xcite with @xmath172 mev ,",
    "the critical temperature at zero chemical potential now would be about @xmath173 mev , it is then quite rational to confront the constraint of the lattice data .    it has turned out that the description of the hadron phase as a non - interacting hadron gas of the nucleons and mesons with medium - modified masses has underestimated the important effects of their interactions at hadron level , and these interactions should be introduced to further reduce the effective masses of nucleons in nuclear matter significantly .",
    "otherwise , such a simple model can not be used to describe the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to improve this model to make it suitable for the complete study of the hadron - quark phase transition in the whole region .",
