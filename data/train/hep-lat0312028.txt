    "overlap fermions  @xcite enables one to compute quantities in the chiral limit of lattice qcd .",
    "but one has to work with @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wilson - dirac operator in the supercritical region and @xmath2 is the sign function of the operator .",
    "this makes the algorithms on the lattice computationally intensive and the situation is further complicated by the presence of very small eigenvalues of @xmath3  @xcite . in spite of these difficulties several results have been obtained in the quenched approximation  @xcite and dynamical simulations using overlap fermions have been explored  @xcite .",
    "large n qcd  @xcite provides an interesting alternative to dynamical simulations of su(3 ) qcd since fermions in the fundamental representation are naturally quenched in the @xmath4 limit of large n qcd as long as the number of flavors are kept finite .",
    "it is useful to use the `` double line '' notation for the gauge propagator in large n qcd to denote that there are two color indices associated with the adjoint representation of the gauge field . in this notation ,",
    "fermions in the fundamental representation have only one line in their propagator .",
    "only planar diagrams survive in the limit of @xmath4 and the vacuum diagrams arising out of the fermionic part are suppressed by a factor of @xmath5 and fermions are naturally quenched  @xcite .",
    "large n qcd has all the qualitative features of @xmath6 qcd and the spectrum of mesons has been calculated in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "one also expects a non - trivial spectrum of mesons in the large n limit of four dimensional qcd but this model has not yet been exactly solved .",
    "eguchi and kawai  @xcite proved that lattice qcd in the limit of @xmath4 can be reduced to qcd on a single site provided the global @xmath7 symmetries that multiplies the link matrices by @xmath8 phases are not broken .",
    "unfortunately , this symmetry is broken for @xmath9  @xcite and one can not reproduce qcd in the large n limit by working on a @xmath10 lattice .",
    "but , the proof of eguchi and kawai also holds for an @xmath11 lattice where @xmath12 . that is to say , the infinite space - time lattice can be reduced to a finite @xmath11 lattice in the limit of @xmath4 provided the global @xmath7 symmetries that multiplies polyakov loops by @xmath8 phases are not broken on the @xmath11 lattice .",
    "the only parameter in the lattice theory is the t hooft gauge coupling @xmath13 .",
    "this coupling has the dimensions of length in three dimensions and it is dimensionless in four dimensions .",
    "one can explicitly compute the location of the transition point @xmath14 such that the @xmath7 symmetries remain unbroken for @xmath15 . if @xmath14 scales properly with @xmath16",
    "then one can define a critical size @xmath17 in the continuum such that the @xmath7 symmetries remain unbroken for @xmath18 .",
    "the argument of eguchi and kawai will hold for all @xmath16 as long as we keep @xmath15 .",
    "there will be no dependence on the box size as long as the box size is bigger than the critical size .",
    "this is referred to as continuum reduction  @xcite .",
    "physical results can be extracted by working on an @xmath11 lattice and keeping @xmath19 just below @xmath14 .",
    "computations need to be done on two or three different values of n to study the infinite n limit .",
    "results for two or three different @xmath16 values can be used to study the effect of finite lattice spacing .",
    "one lattice artifact has to be taken into account when setting the parameters @xmath20 for physical computation .",
    "there is a bulk transition on the lattice in the large n limit that is associated with the spectrum of the single plaquette ( @xmath21 wilson loop ) .",
    "there is no phase transition for finite n but there is a cross - over that gets stronger with increasing n. the eigenvalues @xmath22 of @xmath23 , the parallel transporter along the plaquette , can be anywhere in the range @xmath24 .",
    "but the field strength is small close to the continuum limit and @xmath25 is expected to be in a small range close to zero .",
    "in fact , there is a value of coupling @xmath26 such that the distribution of @xmath25 develops a gap around @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "this value of coupling does not depend on @xmath16 and therefore the transition is purely a lattice artifact .",
    "but one has to set @xmath29 to obtain the proper continuum limit . only for some @xmath30",
    "does @xmath14 become bigger than @xmath26 . for @xmath31",
    "all one has is the bulk transition and the @xmath7 symmetries also break at the same coupling .",
    "this is the reason why one can not obtain continuum qcd in the large n limit using the single site eguchi - kawai model and there is a smallest lattice size that one has to use in @xmath32 .",
    "in order to study qcd in the large n limit , one has to first obtain the appropriate set of parameters @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 symmetries are not broken in @xmath34 and @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "the bulk transition occurs at @xmath37  @xcite and eguchi - kawai reduction holds on a @xmath38 lattice",
    ".    numerical study involves the generation of thermalized gauge field configurations and this is obtained using a combination of heat - bath and over - relaxation updates .",
    "the heat - bath updates are performed on all su(2 ) subgroups and the over - relaxation updates are performed on the full su(n ) group  @xcite . a preliminary investigation in three dimensions show that @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite . therefore , one can obtain results in three dimensional large n qcd by working on as small a lattice as @xmath41 .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath42 symmetries occurs as follows .",
    "there is a @xmath14 where one of the three @xmath42 are broken and the other two remain unbroken .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution of the polyakov lines in the unbroken direction are flat ( random ) but there is a peak in the distribution of the broken line .",
    "as one goes above @xmath14 more lines gets ordered and there are two more transition points at any finite @xmath16 .",
    "more investigation has to performed to study the behavior of the higher transitions as a function of @xmath16 , but the lowest transition corresponding to one ordered polyakov line scales properly with @xmath16 .",
    "it is quite likely that all these transitions fuse as one goes to the continuum limit .",
    "an analysis of this transition shows that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . when combined , these results imply 4.2 < < 5  for  d=3 .",
    "a study of the twisted eguchi - kawai model in four dimensions shows that @xmath47 but that this transition is strongly first order  @xcite .",
    "numerical investigation of the @xmath48 breaking transition shows that only for @xmath49 does @xmath14 go above @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "like in three dimensions , there are many transitions associated with @xmath48 breaking on the lattice .",
    "let @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote phases with @xmath56,@xmath57,@xmath58,@xmath59 and @xmath60 ordered polyakov loops with @xmath19 above @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the phase below @xmath26 .",
    "one can start with a @xmath52 phase and bring it down to a @xmath51 phase and still be below @xmath62 .",
    "this is a metastable state .",
    "this metastable transition from @xmath63 is shown in figs .",
    "[ wil1a]-[wil7b ] .",
    "the system is in a @xmath52 state at @xmath64 on a @xmath65 lattice with @xmath66 and it goes down to a @xmath51 state at @xmath67 . we know that both @xmath64 and @xmath67 are on the weak coupling side of the bulk transition since the eigenvalue distributions of the @xmath21 wilson loop shown in fig .",
    "[ wil1a ] and fig .",
    "[ wil1b ] exhibit strong gaps at both values of @xmath19 .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath48 symmetry can be probed by looking at polyakov loop observables . the polyakov loops ( as well as various wilson loops )",
    "were built out of `` smeared '' @xmath68 matrices , rather than the original link matrices @xmath69  @xcite since it suppresses ultraviolet fluctuations .",
    "let @xmath70 be the smeared polyakov loop in the @xmath71 direction and let its eigenvalues be @xmath72 ; @xmath73",
    ". the quantity  @xcite @xmath74 averaged over the 3-plane perpendicular to @xmath71 will be close to @xmath75 if the @xmath8 symmetry in that direction is not broken .",
    "breaking of @xmath8 symmetry in the @xmath71 direction will open a gap in the spectrum of @xmath70 are @xmath76 will drop below @xmath75",
    ". a time history of @xmath76 in all four directions at @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ timea ] ) shows that the @xmath8 symmetry is broken in one of the four directions but the time history at @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ timeb ] ) shows that all four @xmath8 symmetries are preserved .",
    "therefore @xmath64 is in the @xmath52 phase and @xmath67 is in the @xmath51 phase .",
    "eigenvalue distributions of @xmath70 at @xmath64 also exhibit the breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry in one of the directions as seen in fig .",
    "[ loopa ] .",
    "but all four eigenvalue distributions of @xmath70 at @xmath67 look uniform as seen in fig .",
    "[ loopb ] .",
    "further evidence for @xmath64 in the @xmath52 phase and @xmath67 in the @xmath51 phase can be seen by looking at the eigenvalue distribution of the @xmath77 wilson loop .",
    "this distribution should not have a gap and all six orientations of the wilson loop should look the same at @xmath67 but three of the six wilson loops should look different from the three others at @xmath64 .",
    "this is indeed the case as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ wil7a ] and fig .",
    "[ wil7b ] .",
    "the oscillations seen in the distributions are a finite n effect .",
    "finally , one can see that the system stabilizes in the correct phase even if it started in the wrong phase .",
    "for example , a system started in the @xmath52 phase on a @xmath78 lattice at @xmath79 ends up in the correct @xmath51 phase after a few sweeps of the lattice as seen in fig .",
    "[ 1cto0c ] .",
    "similarly , a system started in the @xmath51 phase on a @xmath65 lattice at @xmath80 ends up in the correct @xmath52 phase after a few sweeps of the lattice as seen in fig .",
    "[ 0cto1c ] .    such a metastable state can be used to reduce @xmath16 where one realizes large n qcd .",
    "we find that one can go as low as @xmath81 and remain in the @xmath51 phase .",
    "the @xmath63 transitions are located at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . for @xmath49 , the transition from unbroken @xmath48 to one broken",
    "@xmath8 occurs in the stable region and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the above values for the critical coupling in the range @xmath81 to @xmath88 can be used to study the scaling of the critical coupling in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the inverse function @xmath89 should scale according to @xmath90 if it is a truly continuum phenomenon .",
    "since the above result is a two - loop result , one has to use the the `` tadpole '' @xcite replacement @xmath91 to study scaling .",
    "[ scale ] shows that the data does scale properly with @xmath92 between 0.245 and 0.275 .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath7 symmetries for @xmath9 implies that eguchi - kawai reduction does not work on a @xmath10 lattice .",
    "quenched eguchi - kawai models  @xcite and twisted eguchi - kawai models  @xcite provide a way out of this problem .",
    "the problem of including fermions in the twisted version of the model has not been completely solved .",
    "it is possible to extract physical quantities in the large n limit of qcd using the quenched version of the model as shown in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "but it is necessary to sample all the @xmath93 minima in the quenched model and this could prove to be numerically difficult in four dimensions .",
    "an alternative to the quenched eguchi - kawai model is provided by the idea of continuum reduction .",
    "continuum reduction implies that there are no finite volume effects in the large n limit of qcd as long as one works with @xmath30 and @xmath94 .    the eigenvalue distribution of the single plaquette exhibits a gap and the space of gauge field configurations naturally splits into several disconnected pieces .",
    "it is natural to assume that the disconnected pieces correspond to different gauge field topologies and this can be explicitly verified by a numerical simulation .",
    "since there are no finite volume effects , one should see evidence for a chiral condensate if the box size is bigger than the critical size and the chiral condensate should occur due to the lowest eigenvalues scaling like @xmath95 as n gets large .",
    "this also can be verified using numerical simulations on fairly small lattices ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) .    since there are no finite volume effects it should be possible to compute meson propagators for arbitrarily small momenta as long as the box size is bigger than the critical size .",
    "normally , it is not possible to work with momenta that are smaller than the inverse of the box size .",
    "this can be avoided in the large n limit of qcd since a constant @xmath8 phase multiplying all the link matrices in a given direction can be interpreted as momentum carried by a quark line  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation works as long as the @xmath7 symmetries are not broken since the pure gauge sector is invariant under a multiplication by a constant phase but the fermion propagator picks up a momentum equal to this constant phase .",
    "this is indeed the case if the box size is bigger than the critical size .",
    "a direct computation of the meson propagators in momentum space will lend credibility to the above argument .",
