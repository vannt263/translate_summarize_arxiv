    "there exits a very fundamental relation connecting the observed luminosity distance @xmath1 and angular diameter distance @xmath2 at the same redshift @xmath3 , namely : @xmath4 .",
    "this is the so - called `` distance duality relation ''  @xcite ( ddr thereafter ) .",
    "this reciprocity relation always holds true under the following three general conditions :    * a. the spacetime is described by a metric theory of gravity ; * b. photons travel along null geodesics ; * c. the number of photons is conserved .",
    "conditions a and b are very basic , related to the foundations of the theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "violation of c can be achieved much easier by cosmic opacity @xcite .",
    "the number of photons arriving from standard candles , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , may be altered simply by the absorbtion and scattering on dust on their way to the observer .",
    "more exotic scenarios invoked in the literature , comprise the conversion of photons ( in the presence of extragalactic magnetic fields ) to very light axions  @xcite , gravitons  @xcite , kaluza - klein modes associated with extra - dimensions  @xcite or a chameleon field  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite important and necessary to test the ddr because any violation of it could be a clue of new physics .    starting with the first paper on this subject @xcite",
    ", many efforts have been devoted to validate the ddr with observational data  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in these works , the most common and mature strategy was to compare luminosity distances from sne ia ( basing on union2 and union 2.1 sn ia compilations  @xcite ) and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters at almost the same redshifts .",
    "the advantage of such strategy is that the number of well - measured sne ia increased rapidly during recent years .",
    "however , the sample size of @xmath2 from galaxy clusters is still limited to several dozens .",
    "what is even more important , the angular diameter distances estimated from x - ray and sz - studies of clusters are sensitive to the assumptions about the hot gas density profile ( simple @xmath5 or double  @xmath5 profile ) and the underlying geometry of the cluster ( spherical or elliptical ) .",
    "all these unknowns contribute to systematic uncertainties which are hard to quantify .",
    "some researchers took the opposite approach , namely assuming that ddr was valid they tried to draw conclusions regarding galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "other papers  @xcite used angular diameter distance data from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "however , there is one more disadvantage of ddr studies performed so far .",
    "namely most of them used distance data ( both angular diameter and luminosity distances ) which were obtained under the assumption of a certain particular cosmological model ( usually flat @xmath6cdm ) .",
    "of course ddr as a fundamental relation based only on assumptions a - c , does not depend on a cosmological model .",
    "however , the distances inferred under the assumption of a specific cosmology may be biased , hence obscuring the issue of how stringent the resulting constraints on possible violation of the ddr might be .",
    "the violations of ddr found in previous studies might originate from these @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method of testing the ddr , which is completely free from prior assumptions concerning the details of cosmological model except the geometry , i.e. , a flat frw cosmology , while other state of the art methods furthermore depend on information like hubble constant or dark energy ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) .",
    "the idea is to consider jointly the sne ia and strong gravitational lensing systems .",
    "cosmological model independence is achieved at the prize of keeping some nuisance parameters associated with the sn ia light - curve calibration  @xcite and strong lens model assumption .",
    "let us also stress that by its construction our test becomes independent of the sn absolute magnitude .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section2 we introduce the observations of strong lensing and sne ia .",
    "then we describe the methodology of testing ddr and present the results in section 3 .",
    "finally we discuss and summarize the results in section 4 .",
    "strong gravitational lensing has become an important and powerful tool to study both background cosmology and the structure of galaxies acting as lenses .",
    "being more specific : the combined measurements of stellar central velocity dispersion @xmath9 and image separations ( the einstein radius ) @xmath10 supplemented with an assumption about lens mass density profile , can provide us the angular diameter distance ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angular diameter distances from the lens to the source and from the observer to the source , respectively .",
    "for example within the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model of the lens , distance ratio @xmath14 is related to observable quantities in the following way @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the speed of light ( later on in eq.([mub ] ) we introduce another quantity denoted @xmath16 but the distinction from the speed of light should be clear from the context ) , @xmath10 is the einstein radius and @xmath17 denotes the velocity dispersion due to lens mass distribution . let us stress that @xmath17 need not to be exactly equal to the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath9  @xcite . in order to account for this",
    "we introduce a phenomenological free parameter @xmath18 @xcite defined by the relation : @xmath19 it is worth repeating that @xmath18 accounts not only for systematic errors caused by taking the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath9 as @xmath17 but also for deviation of the real mass density profile from the sis and the effects of secondary lenses ( nearby galaxies ) and line - of - sight contamination @xcite .",
    "the fractional uncertainty of @xmath14 is given by : @xmath20 following the strategy adopted by slacs team , we take the fractional uncertainty of the einstein radius at the level of @xmath21 for all lensing systems .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath9 measurements are taken from the data .",
    "this approach has already been used to constrain cosmological parameters and the evolution of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use a new compilation of 118 galactic strong lensing systems from sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) , boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ) , lenses structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ) and strong legacy survey ( sl2s ) presented in cao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the possibility of getting @xmath14 from strong lensing systems is the starting point of our idea . in order to constrain ddr violation , @xmath14 from strong lenses",
    "will be compared with analogous ( although not exactly the same ) luminosity distance ratios @xmath22 from the sne ia .    as a source of sn ia data , we use jla compilation @xcite obtained by the sdss - ii and snls collaborations .",
    "it contains several low - redshift samples ( z@xmath230.1 ) , all three seasons from the sdss - ii ( 0.05@xmath23z@xmath230.4 ) , and three years from snls ( 0.2@xmath23z@xmath231 ) . in total",
    "it contains 740 data points . as was pointed out by yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , data reported in the form of distance moduli actually depend on the details of cosmological model assumed .",
    "for example , the union2 @xcite and union2.1 @xcite compilations calibrated the sne ia with @xmath24 cosmology , while the jla used flat @xmath7 model .",
    "therefore , it is inappropriate to use these distance moduli data directly as they depend on the cosmological model assumed a priori . in our work",
    ", instead we use the original measurements of observed b band magnitude @xmath25 , the stretch factor @xmath26 and color parameter @xmath16 in the distance modulus : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is in @xmath29 . note that @xmath30 are directly extracted from the light curve and are independent of cosmological model , @xmath31 and @xmath5 are nuisance parameters related to the well - known broader - brighter and bluer - brighter relationships .",
    "the absolute b band magnitude @xmath32 is another calibrating parameter but as we will see it will cancel in the distance ratios . hence , the uncertainty of luminosity distance is : @xmath33    redshift distributions of lenses , sources and supernovae used in our analysis are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , lenses and sources overlap sufficiently with the supernovae .",
    "one possible way to test ddr , is to use the following parametrization : @xmath34 standard ddr implies @xmath35 .",
    "all deviations from it , which might occur at different redshifts are encoded in the function @xmath36 .",
    "since all redshifts of the objects we use satisfy @xmath37 , we just take the first order term of the taylor expansion of @xmath36 .",
    "the most straightforward way to test ddr would be to compare the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance at the same redshift via eq .",
    "(  [ ddr ] ) .",
    "however , we can also test it using the distance ratios , because the strong lensing system provides us angular diameter distance ( @xmath2 ) ratio @xmath14 .",
    "next , by virtue of the ddr we should express it through the luminosity distance ratio @xmath22 .",
    "however the numerator @xmath12 is the angular diameter distance from lens to source and one can not find an observable corresponding to a similar luminosity distance from the supernova data .",
    "therefore , taking advantage of the fact that in flat cosmological model comoving distance @xmath38 between lens and source is simply @xmath39 , one can rewrite the @xmath14 in a simple way which contains the ratio of @xmath40 and @xmath13 : @xmath41 note that in a non - flat universe , @xmath14 as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath13 can be quite complex @xcite and it is extremely difficult to make the calculation with the covariance matrix of jla data . for robustness and simplicity ,",
    "we only consider the flat case in this work as a first step .",
    "then , using the eq.([ddr ] ) one can write : @xmath42 where @xmath43 this is the main formula used to infer the value of @xmath44 ( capturing any possible deviations from the ddr ) .",
    "it involves observables @xmath45 and @xmath46 . note that @xmath47 and @xmath48 here are not exact counterparts but they can be derived from the observed quantities .",
    "let us also point out that , by virtue of eq.([mub ] ) , @xmath49 $ ] , the absolute magnitude of a fiducial sn ia cancels out .",
    "the redshifts here have the meaning of redshifts of the supernovae located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "therefore , for each lensing system , we have to find two sne ia located at the lens and the source redshifts . to achieve this , many approaches have been proposed .",
    "we adopt the simplest and efficient method of holanda et al.(2010 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which applies the following criterion : if the redshift difference between the lens or the source and its matched sn ia is smaller than 0.005 , it can be ignored . to avoid correlations among individual ddr tests , which would occur if we could select the same sn ia pair for different lensing systems , we adopt the procedure that if certain sn ia pair is matched to some lensing system it can not be used again .",
    "this procedure resulted in selecting a sample smaller than original 118 lenses .",
    "the number of filtered lensing systems are 60 and the redshift differences are summarized in fig .",
    "[ rds ] .     for both lenses and sources .",
    ", width=302 ]    next we use the pymc python module that implements bayesian statistical models and fitting algorithms , including markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to calculate full posterior pdf : @xmath52 .",
    "the likelihood is derived from the @xmath53 function @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the covariance matrix for the  observational quantity \" @xmath56 . using eq.([dadl ] ) , one can write each component : @xmath57    prior probability for the parameters @xmath58 is the product of respective priors assumed to be uniform distributions : @xmath59 , p(\\alpha)=u[-0.6,0.6 ] , p(\\beta)=u[-1.0,10.0 ] , p(f_e)=u[0.85,1.15]$ ] .",
    "note that for jla data @xcite , the errors include both statistic and systematic ones .",
    "the systematic error can be embodied in the full covariance matrix of all data points , which can make the uncertainties larger . in this work ,",
    "we only consider a small part of jla data and the corresponding systematic errors .",
    "the different feature here is the constructed observational quantities are distance ratios , therefore , we have to consider the systematic errors for pairs .",
    "our results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ resulttab ] and shown in fig . [ result ] .",
    "constraint contours were plotted using the publicly available package  corner.py \" .",
    "one can see that @xmath60 is located near the center of @xmath61 contour , best fitted central value being @xmath62 indicating that the ddr is in a very well agreement with the observations and there is no signs of its violation in light of sn ia and strong lensing data .. however , like the analysis in @xcite , the independent determination of the flatness of our universe at the percent level , implies that corrections coming from deviations from flatness should be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the errors considered here . ]    in order to see how stringent the results of joint analysis would be , we have also considered galaxy clusters with angular diameter distances determined from x - ray data combined with sunyaev - zeldovich effect measured in these clusters .",
    "let us stress that in principle cluster distances are also obtained in a model independent way .",
    "however , systematic uncertainties are different : for strong lensing systems they come form the ansatz of sis augmented with @xmath18 factor , whereas for clusters they come from the model assumptions concerning gas distribution profile .",
    "we have considered two separate data sets .",
    "first , there were 38 clusters of @xcite where spherical symmetry was assumed and the cluster plasma was assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with dark matter following navarro - frenk - white profile .",
    "second sample comprised 25 clusters analyzed by @xcite within elliptical model .",
    "the analysis details are similar to @xcite .",
    "in particular , we used the eq.([ddr ] ) to derive distance modulus to the cluster : @xmath63 } + 25 $ ] ( @xmath36 here is the inverse in yang et al . 2013 ) and then we considered the chi - square function of the form @xmath64 , where @xmath65 the covariance matrix includes the corresponding systematic errors of the sne we use ( 38 or 25 points ) .",
    "here , the supernova absolute magnitude @xmath32 should be included as an extra nuisance parameter .",

    "validation of ddr using extragalactic observations is an important issue in modern cosmology .",
    "any strong enough evidence of its violation could be a signal of new physics either in the theory of gravity or in the particle physics sector .",
    "currently most common method to test ddr was to compare luminosity distances from standard candles ( sne ia ) and angular diameter distances from standard rulers ( galaxy clusters ) .",
    "technically such an approach demanded that some specific cosmological model be assumed together with the values of its parameters like the hubble constant , cosmic equation of state or matter density parameter @xmath69 .",
    "this resulted in additional source of uncertainties and bias .    in this paper",
    ", we proposed a new method to test distance - duality relation ( ddr ) which is free from such shortcomings ( though it still assumes a flat universe ) .",
    "the idea is to use strong lensing systems with known redshifts to the lenses and to the sources , the einstein rings and central velocity dispersions .",
    "these observables allow us to infer the angular diameter distance ratios which  by virtue of the ddr  could be linked to luminosity distance ratios of matched pairs of sne ia and hence used to test the violations of the ddr . using a recent compilation of 118 strong lensing ( sl ) systems and 740 sne ia from the jla compilation",
    "we were able to select 60 matched ( sl  sn ) pairs to perform the test .",

    "the method we proposed is an interesting new technique , complementary to previous methods used by the others . combining it with previous methods that may be improved in the future",

    "if the cluster modelling problem is solved in the future , the combination will give a cosmological - model independent result at better precision than previous cosmological - model dependent approaches @xcite can get .",
    "the forthcoming new generation of sky surveys like the euclid mission , pan - starrs , lsst , jdem , are estimated to discover from thousands to tens of thousands of strong lensing systems .",
    "even with a few percent fraction of them having spectroscopic follow - ups , this would enlarge the sl sample considerably making the constraints on ddr violation much more stringent .",
