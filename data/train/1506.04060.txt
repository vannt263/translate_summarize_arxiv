    "the question whether the standard notions of thermodynamics are still applicable in the quantum regime has experienced a renewed interest in the recent years .",
    "this refreshed motivation can be explained as the consequence of two successes . on the one hand",
    ", the spectacular progress of the experiments encompassed in the so called _ quantum simulators _ already allows for a direct observation of thermodynamic phenomena in many different quantum systems , such as ultra cold atoms in optical lattices , ion traps , superconductor qubits , etc @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inflow of ideas from quantum information theory provided significant insight into the thermodynamics of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "specifically , qualitative improvements have been made in understanding how the methods of statistical mechanics can be justified from quantum mechanics as its underlying theory @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental postulates of thermodynamics is the so called zeroth law : two bodies , each in thermodynamic equilibrium with a third system , are in equilibrium with each other @xcite .",
    "this is the law that stands behind the notion of temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact , the above formulation of the zeroth law consists of three parts : ( i ) there exists a thermal equilibrium state which is characterized by a single parameter called temperature , and isolated systems tend to this state @xcite ; ( ii ) the temperature is local , namely , each part of the whole is in a thermal state @xcite ; and ( iii ) the temperature is an intensive quantity : if the whole is in equilibrium , all the parts have the same temperature @xcite .",
    "the last two points are usually derived from statistical mechanics under the assumption of weakly interacting systems .",
    "nevertheless , when the interactions present in the system are non - negligible , the points ( ii ) and ( iii ) need to be revised . following the direction given by refs .",
    "@xcite , in this work we concentrate on the clarification and generalization of the aforementioned aspects of the zeroth law of the thermodynamics for spin chains with strong , short range interactions .    the general setting of the problem is as follows .",
    "the system with hamiltonian @xmath0 is in thermal equilibrium , described by a canonical state at inverse temperature @xmath1 , @xmath2 and we seek to understand the thermal properties of a finite part of the system .",
    "obviously , in the presence of strong interactions , the reduced density matrix of a subsystem of the global system ( especially in the quantum regime @xcite ) will not generally have the same form as ( [ eq : thermal - state ] ) . in lattice systems , where the hamiltonian is a sum of local terms interacting according to some underlying graph ,",
    "it is unclear how one can locally assign temperature to a subsystem .",
    "more precisely , the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : boundaryregion ] ) of a global thermal state is described by @xmath4 which will not be thermal unless the particles in @xmath3 do not interact with its environment @xmath5 .",
    "hence , given only a subsystem state @xmath6 and its hamiltonian @xmath7 , it is not possible to assign a temperature to it , since this would totally depend on the features of the environment and the interactions that couple the subsystem to it .    in the context of quantum information , a first step to circumvent the problem of assigning temperature to a subsystem was made in ref .",
    "there , for harmonic lattices it was shown that it is sufficient to extend the subsystem @xmath3 by a boundary region @xmath8 that , when traced out , disregards the correlations and the boundary effects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryregion ] ) .",
    "if the size of such a boundary region is independent of the total system size , temperature can still be said to be _",
    "local_.    more explicitly , given a lattice hamiltonian @xmath0 with a subsystem @xmath3 ,",
    "a shell region around it @xmath8 and its environment @xmath9 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryregion ] , we aim to understand how the expectation values of operators that act non - trivially only on @xmath3 for the global thermal state @xmath10 differ from those taken for the thermal state of the truncated hamiltonian @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) as the width @xmath13 of the boundary region @xmath8 increases : @xmath14 - \\tr\\bigl[o\\,\\rho_a\\bigr]\\le ||o||_\\infty f(\\ell_b)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the state of @xmath3 for the chain truncated to @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is expected to be a monotonically decreasing function in @xmath13 .",
    "the width of the boundary region @xmath13 is defined as the graph - distance between the sets of vertices ( regions ) @xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "surely , the differences ( [ dist1 ] ) fully characterize the distance of @xmath19 from @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the trace distance , a distinguishability measure for quantum states , @xmath20 , has the following representation @xcite : @xmath21\\leq f(\\ell_b),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the identity operator in the hilbert space of @xmath3 .    , the boundary region @xmath8 , and their environment @xmath18 for a spin chain .",

    "@xcite , it is proven that the correlations responsible for the distinguishability between the truncated and non - truncated thermal states are quantified by a _ generalized covariance_. for any two operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , full - rank quantum state @xmath26 , and parameter @xmath27 $ ] , the generalized covariance is defined as @xmath28 and the average distinguishability of the two states measurements of some observable @xmath24 can provide reads as @xmath29 - \\tr\\bigl[o\\,\\omega(h)\\bigr ] = 2\\int_0 ^ 1 { { \\mathrm{d}}}s\\int_0^{\\beta/2 } { { \\mathrm{d}}}t \\ , { { \\rm cov}}_{\\omega_s}^{t/\\beta } ( h_{{i } } , o),\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the corresponding hamiltonian term that couples @xmath8 and @xmath18 , @xmath31 is the truncated hamiltonian ( see fig .",

    "@xcite , it is shown that for any local hamiltonian there is a threshold temperature ( that only depends on the connectivity of the underlying graph ) above which the generalized covariance decays exponentially . nevertheless , it is far from clear what occurs below the threshold , and , especially , at low temperatures ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that , in that case , the right hand side of the truncation formula ( [ eq : truncation_error_in_terms_of_cov ] ) could be significantly different from zero since the integration runs up until @xmath35 , while the covariance is expected to decay only algebraically for critical systems .    in this work",
    "we show that , for one dimensional translation - invariant systems , temperature is local for any @xmath1 .",
    "away from criticality , we rigorously bound the truncation formula ( [ eq : truncation_error_in_terms_of_cov ] ) by mapping the generalized covariance to the contraction of a tensor network and exploiting some standard results in condensed matter . at criticality",
    ", we use some results from _ conformal field theory _ @xcite .",
    "finally , the results in @xcite , where the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles is proven for translation - invariant lattices with short range interactions , render our results valid also when , instead of being canonical , ( [ eq : thermal - state ] ) , the global state @xmath10 is , e.g. , microcanonical .",
    "the latter is defined as an equiprobable mixture of all the energy eigenstates in a narrow energy window ( see @xcite for details ) . in condensed matter physics",
    ", this problem has been considered in the context of approximating the expectation values of infinite systems by finite ones , receiving the name of _ finite size scaling _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , the finite - size - scaling methods are more focused to find the values for the critical exponents and the transition temperature by observing how measured quantities vary for different lattice sizes .",

    "while transfer matrix arguments work satisfactory for gapped systems , conformal field theory results have to be used at criticality . in sec .  5 ,",
    "all our results are illustrated in detail for the ising model , for which we study in addition the behaviour of the generalized covariance and compute explicitly the physical distinguishability between the full and truncated hamiltonians both at and off criticality .",
