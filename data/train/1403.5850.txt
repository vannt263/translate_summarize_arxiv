    "thermal x - rays from the supernova remnants ( snrs ) are due to shock - heated plasma .",
    "electrons are first heated to high temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , and then the atoms are gradually ionized .",
    "therefore , the plasmas in young and intermediate - aged snrs are often described by a non - equilibrium ionization plasma ( nei ) , or more specifically an ionizing plasma ( ip ) .",
    "electron temperature ( @xmath6 ) is higher than that predicted from the mean ionization states of elements ( ionization temperature : @xmath7 ) .",
    "as snrs age , the ionization rate decreases and is balanced by the recombination rate ; therefore , the plasma reaches collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) with @xmath8 .",
    "the reverse case is a recombination - dominant process ( @xmath9)recombining plasma ( rp ) .",
    "previous studies on thermal x - ray spectra in snrs have used ip to describe young snrs and cie plasma to describe old snrs . this canonical scenario for snr plasma evolution",
    "has been challenged by the recent _ suzaku _ discoveries of rp from several mixed - morphology snrs @xcite , ic443 , w49b , g359.1@xmath100.5 , w28 , w44 , g346.3@xmath100.2 , and g348.5@xmath110.1 @xcite .",
    "as evidence of the existence of rp , the authors cite the detection of enhanced radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) , x - ray emissions that are made when free electrons are directly recombined with atoms in a bound state ( free - bound transition ) .",
    "rrc is most conspicuous for the transition of free electrons to the ground state of either he- or h - like atoms .",
    "most rrcs discovered so far are those of he - like magnesium ( mg ) , silicon ( si ) , and sulfur ( s ) below @xmath04  kev , a clouded energy band in which many emission lines from abundant elements overlap on the rrc structures .",
    "thus , the rrc signatures are only revealed as saw - teeth like residuals when fit to the ip or cie model . on the other hand",
    ", rrc structures should be more conspicuous in the energy band 410 kev , because the rrc structures  those of iron ( fe ) and calcium ( ca)are more sparsely spaced , with no overlap of emission lines from the relevant elements in this energy band .",
    "however , no rrc structures of ca and fe have been reported ",
    "except fe from w49b @xcite  mainly due to the limited statistics in the high - energy band .",
    "therefore , we conducted deep observations on ic443 , the most robust rp snr and only the rrcs of mg , si , and s but no other higher z elements have been found @xcite .",
    "ic443 ( g189.1@xmath113.0 ) is located on the galactic anti - center at a distance of 1.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "the remnant is associated with a dense giant molecular cloud @xcite near the gem ob1 association @xcite .",
    "thus , ic443 is likely a remnant of a core - collapse supernova . using the _ asca _ satellite",
    ", @xcite found that the k - shell intensity ratios of h - like si and s relative to he - like si and s were significantly higher than those expected in the cie plasma of the electron temperature determined from the bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "they concluded that the plasma in ic443 was rp .",
    "@xcite found rrcs of mg , si , and s and estimated that @xmath12 and @xmath13 were , respectively , @xmath00.6 and @xmath01.01.2  kev , confirming the existence of rp . in this paper , we report further evidence of rp on the basis of the new discoveries of rrcs from ca and fe based on _ suzaku _ deep observations .",
    "we discuss the characteristic features of rp .",
    "we used the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ suzaku _ satellite @xcite to perform multiple observations of ic443 .",
    "the first observation was made during the announcement of opportunity cycle  1 ( ao1 ) phase and the results were reported by @xcite .",
    "then deep observations of @xmath0370  ks exposure were performed in the ao7 phase .",
    "the log of these observations is given in table  [ table_observation ] .",
    "xis comprises four x - ray ccd cameras located at the foci of individual x - ray telescopes @xcite ; three ( xis  0 , 2 , 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) , while the other ( xis  1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) ccds .",
    "xis  2 has not been functioning since 2006 november , and one quadrant of xis  0 has been unavailable since 2009 june , both possibly damaged by the micro - meteorites . for data reduction and spectral analysis , we used heasoft version  6.12 and spex @xcite version  2.02.04 , respectively .",
    "xis data were reprocessed using xispi software and the calibration database was updated in 2013 march .",

    "the spectra of the two fi ccds ( xis  0 and 3 ) are merged to improve the statistics , because their response functions are almost identical .",
    "we analyze only the merged fi spectrum because the nxb of the bi in the 610  kev band is higher than that of the source counts ; therefore , nxb subtraction significantly degrades the source spectrum of bi .",

    "the other large residual is a triangle - shaped structure at 810  kev . considering the energy resolution of approximately 300  ev ( at 810  kev ) , the energy of leading edge of the triangle is @xmath08.9 kev , which corresponds to the binding energy of the ground state of he - like fe , and thus the triangle would be an rrc of he - like fe .    in figure  [ figure_cie ]",
    ", we also see a wavy residual at 56 kev .",
    "the leading edge energies of the wave are @xmath05.1 and @xmath05.5  kev , which are likely the rrcs of he- and h - like ca . to examine these possible rrcs of ca",
    ", we magnify the spectrum in the 4.66.2  kev band and fit it with a model of bremsstrahlung emission plus fixed cxb .",
    "this model is not accepted with the @xmath26/dof @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , leaving a wavy excess at 56  kev , as shown in figure  [ figure_carrc](b ) .",
    "we then add two rrc models for this wavy structure with the leading edges at 5.13 and 5.48  kev , which are the predicted values of he- and h - like ca rrcs , respectively .",
    "for the rrc model , an exponential decay tail of an _ e_-folding temperature is added above the edge energy .",
    "the temperature for the rrc and that of the bremsstrahlung are free parameters but are linked with each other .",

    "this situation is somewhat similar to those of ca and ni .",
    "this apparent `` inconsistency '' is due to the rp proper characteristic , and thus is not found in ip .",

    "the charge number appears . unlike the ionization rate ,",
    "the recombination rate does not strongly depend on the charge number , and thus a broad distribution of different ions is achieved in rp at a large @xmath1 . in our case , h - like fe can survive in a wide range of @xmath1 , significantly varying from 10@xmath62 to 10@xmath63  @xmath35  s. near @xmath010@xmath63  @xmath35  s , the fraction of h - like fe decreases to almost 0% .",
    "rrcs of he - like atoms occur due to the recombination of free electrons to the ground states of h - like ions . at low electron temperature ( 0.65  kev ) ,",
    "collisional excitation rate of he - like atoms from ground to excited states is far smaller than that of the recombination process .",
    "the contribution of the cascade line , which originates from electrons captured at the excited levels of ions by free - bound transition @xcite , is significantly larger than that of the line flux that originates from collisional excitation .",
    "therefore , the flux of he - like k - shell lines and rrc are approximately proportional to the fraction of h - like ions .",

    "to check this high ratio of @xmath56/@xmath53 , we compare spex with the other sets of atomic data concerned @xcite and estimate the uncertainty to be 20% .",
    "we thus conclude that the ratio of @xmath56/@xmath53 relative to the solar abundances is in the range of @xmath0812 .",
    "unlike the absolute value of abundance for each element , this high ratio of @xmath56/@xmath53 is valid in the error range of @xmath1 .",
    "however , such a high ratio is not predictable from any theoretical model of spherically symmetric explosion in core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a similar high ratio of ni to fe relative to the solar abundances @xmath08 was obtained from core - collapse snrs , g350.1@xmath100.3 and g349.7@xmath110.2 , suggesting that a significant fraction of ni is ejected from the core region of their progenitors @xcite . for sn2006aj , @xcite proposed a model in which a large amount of @xmath64ni might be ejected from the core as a result of asymmetric explosion .",
