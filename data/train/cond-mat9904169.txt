    "one - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibit remarkable physical properties .",
    "one of the most interesting case is the s=1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain .",
    "contrary to the s=1/2 case , this system has a gap as predicted by haldane@xcite and a finite spin correlation length .",
    "it is an example of a system which is disordered at zero temperature due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the original conjecture has been checked experimentally@xcite , numerically@xcite as well as analytically@xcite .",
    "although the ground state is disordered in the sense that spin correlations decay exponentially , there is a hidden topological order@xcite that is revealed in the bulk of the chain only by nonlocal observables or by ground state degeneracy in an open geometry .",
    "this hidden order is most clearly seen in the vbs wavefunction which is an approximate ground state of the spin-1 chain@xcite . to construct this wavefunction one",
    "has first to write each spin s=1 as a triplet of two fictitious spins s=1/2 .",
    "then one couples nearest - neighbor spins s=1/2 into singlets .",
    "this leads to a function which is obviously singlet and translation invariant .",
    "it is an excellent approximation of the true ground state@xcite .",
    "the perfect crystalline pattern of singlets is the hidden order .",
    "k. hida has given an appealing picture of the haldane gap and the vbs ground state by considering an alternating ferro - antiferromagnetic s=1/2 chain@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by ( see figure 1 )  : @xmath0 here @xmath1 are s=1/2 spin operators , @xmath2 is _ positive _ and @xmath3 is _ negative_. in what follows , we set @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the family of systems defined by eq.([faf ] ) has simple limiting cases .",
    "for @xmath6 we have a set of decoupled pairs of spins that have a trivial ground state  : all pairs are locked in singlets . when @xmath7 , the s=1/2 are coupled by pairs into s=1 states and we get a chain of spins s=1 .",
    "hida has studied numerically the gap of the system as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "he has used lanczos diagonalization techniques to evaluate the gap and he showed that there is no phase transition as a function of @xmath8 . as a consequence , the haldane gap of the limit @xmath7 is continuously connected to the trivial gap of the decoupled limit @xmath6 .",
    "the excitation spectrum also evolves smoothly .",
    "so the alternating chain offers a simple physical picture of both the haldane gap and the hidden topological order .",
    "there is another approach to quantum spin chains which is the continuum field theory known as the nonlinear @xmath9 model ( nl@xmath9 m ) .",
    "introduced originally by haldane@xcite , this field theory includes a topological term@xcite @xmath10 for a spin - s chain .",
    "while this term can be discarded when s is integer , it is responsible for masslessness when @xmath11 ( mod @xmath12 ) , i.e. for half - integer spin chain .",
    "this approach has been recently applied @xcite to spin ladders where there is also a parity effect which is given by the number of legs of the ladder . indeed , spin ladders with even number of legs are generically gapped while odd - numbered ones are gapless .",
    "this effect can be explained in the nl@xmath9 m framework with a topological term which is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of legs .",
    "it is also of great interest to consider generalized spin ladders with various types of bond alternation and/or additional exchange couplings .",
    "for example , a spin ladder with a diagonal coupling interpolates smoothly@xcite between the s=1 chain and the two - leg spin ladder .",
    "previous investigations@xcite of these more general situations have used the nl@xmath9 m but with the impossibility to treat cases including ferro bonds as in the ferro - antiferro chain introduced by hida .    in this work ,",
    "we present a generalized nl@xmath9 m that includes additional massive modes and we show that this model is able to reproduce the s=1 limit of alternating chain of hida .",
    "we discuss the construction of this new effective theory in the path - integral framework although it could also be done in the hamiltonian formalism with identical results .    in sect .",
    "[ 1 ] we treat hida s chain case .",
    "we compute the spin - wave spectrum , motivate the nl@xmath9 m approach and compute an approximate spin gap formula for the whole range of @xmath8 . in sect .",
    "[ 2 ] , we apply the same formalism to white s mapping from the spin-1 chain to the antiferromagnetic two - leg ladder . sect . [ 3 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "a nl@xmath9 m for the spin chain is a non perturbative field theory which is built on the lowest energy modes of the classical theory of the chain .",
    "we first study this alternating spin chain at the classical level .",
    "the equations of motion for the ferro - antiferromagnetic spin chain follow from @xmath15 $ ] and are given by  : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the classical spin vector at site @xmath18 .",
    "then we linearize those equations around the neel order configuration @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary unitary vector and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are orthogonal planar vector fields .",
    "note that @xmath21 breaks the natural o(3 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "we represent both @xmath22 and @xmath23 by complex fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the linearized equations of motion then reads  : @xmath26 a plane wave ansatz for those fields is  : @xmath27 the eigenstates @xmath28 of energy @xmath29 and momentum @xmath30 are the eigenvectors of the following matrix  : @xmath31 , \\ ] ] with eigenvalues @xmath32 .",
    "the energy @xmath29 is a solution of its characteristic polynomial @xmath33 the dispersion relation is given by  : @xmath34 the two lowest positive excitations correspond to momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "linearizing the dispersion relation around @xmath37 , we obtain for those modes the linear relation @xmath38 .",
    "hence the velocity of those spin waves is @xmath39 .",
    "they stand for the two goldstone modes of the ( classically ) broken @xmath40 symmetry .",
    "we will ground our nl@xmath9 m on them , assuming they are slowing varying modes , in an theory where the rotational symmetry is unbroken .",
    "we also reasonably assume that the massive modes do not interfere significantly with the goldstone modes , their energy being of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "here we briefly recall the derivation of the nl@xmath9 m for an antiferromagnetic spin - s chain with @xmath42 even .",
    "so consider a spin - s antiferromagnetic spin chain with s even , characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "this spin chain can be mapped onto a nl@xmath9 m .",
    "the mapping can be performed within the lagrangian formalism if one uses coherent states representation for the spin operators .",
    "the discrete action is made of the exchange interaction terms and of the berry phases @xmath44 $ ] of the spin vector field @xmath17 . @xmath45.\\ ] ] the coherent state vectors @xmath17 are expanded according to @xmath46 where the vector field @xmath47 ( local staggered magnetization ) is unitary and the field @xmath48 satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "those fields can be hinted at from the study of modes in the semi - classical spin chain .",
    "now suppose @xmath48 is of order of magnitude @xmath50 , the lattice spacing .",
    "this representation of the spin chain allows for a continuous form for the action @xmath51 , which depends on the fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 . because we supposed @xmath54 is of magnitude @xmath50 , the action is quadratic in @xmath54 so that the field can be integrated out .",
    "now recall that the spin magnitude s is even .",
    "then the berry phases of the spin coherent states partially gather to form a topological term @xmath55 , the effect of which is null in the action .",
    "the final effective action in the field @xmath56 is  : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the coupling constant of the nl@xmath9 m : @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the velocity @xmath61 .",
    "let us consider now the alternating spin chain .",
    "the main difficulty we encounter in trying to represent the hida chain is the fact that it is inhomogeneous , so that writing an adequate continuous action out of the discrete hamiltonian is not a trivial task .",
    "indeed , the fundamental microscopic structure is a block of two spins ( call them @xmath62 and @xmath63 , say ) . it will turn out that it is better to choose pairs of spins naturally coupled by the ferromagnetic link , preferably to the antiferromagnetic one .",
    "this choice corresponds anyway to hida s idea of pairing those spins s=1/2 to make them an effective spin-1 in the limit where @xmath8 goes to infinity ( large ferromagnetic coupling ) .",
    "the most rigorous way we could imagine to handle the continuous limit would be to introduce two coherent states vector fields , one for each of the two sites .",
    "unfortunately , this would yield an intricate action , due to the appearance of several equally contributing massive modes .",
    "in particular , the berry phases contribution of those coherent states would not be any more easily recognizable as a topological invariant .",
    "now consider a two - block structure , made of the four spins @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the pairs @xmath66 and @xmath67 are appropriate candidates to generate two nl@xmath9 m models .",
    "a first ( incorrect ) idea , sustained by our wish to go to the continuous limit , is to assume that they form the same nl@xmath9 m .",
    "this assumption would be correct in the limiting case @xmath8 goes to infinity , but far too crude in any other case .    to cure this , at least partially , we add one extra field @xmath68 to the two semi - classical nl@xmath9 m slow modes @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "it represents small quantum fluctuations , remnants of massive modes , that may bring about effective corrections to the nl@xmath9 m action .",
    "accordingly , the coherent states fields are decomposed as  : @xmath69    here @xmath42 is the spin magnitude and @xmath50 is the lattice spacing .",
    "note that this lattice spacing is of the length of a two - spin block .",
    "the amplitude of the quantum fluctuation is of the order of this lattice spacing .",
    "this assumption make the problem a tractable one , since we do not need to consider derivatives of the field @xmath68 when expanding the action .",
    "we enforce it by setting @xmath50 as a prefactor of the fluctuating field .",
    "note that the standard momentum field @xmath54 is implicitly assumed to be of order @xmath50 .",
    "we intentionally chose only one fluctuation field , contrary to senechal s scheme @xcite where the coherent state fields are decomposed on as many possible independent fluctuation fields .",
    "we now justify the choice of this particular field by means of a path integral reasoning .",
    "we suspect that some highly fluctuating paths are contributing in the action . indeed , exchange couplings vary on the microscopic scale by a macroscopic amount , and do not behave smoothly with respect to the position . as a consequence",
    "some irregular paths might be energetically favorable .",
    "yet a straightforward continuous limit of the action would not retain them since they are not spatially regular .",
    "that is why we should enforce some possible ( non derivable ) contributing fluctuation in the paths .",
    "now let us see why we chose this particular field @xmath68 .",
    "the fields @xmath48 and @xmath70 parametrize the variation of the path between the two - block pattern @xmath71 , spatially indexed by @xmath18 .",
    "so we need one field to represent the variation inside the two - spin blocks . in the block @xmath72",
    ", the coherent state vectors @xmath73 and @xmath74 differ by an amount of @xmath75 .",
    "since the microscopic pattern is a two - spin block , we have then no choice than to make the coherent state vectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 differ by an amount of @xmath78 , because the variation on the scale of the two - spin block are already taken into account within the nl@xmath9 m fields . and",
    "this exhausts contributing infinitesimal fluctuations of the path .",
    "the action of the spin chain we get through the coherent states representation is of the form @xmath79.\\ ] ] one can expand the coupling terms in the action , then goes to the continuous limit , which yields @xmath80.\\ ] ] we emphasize the fact that the ferromagnetic exchange terms are of course expanded from its aligned configuration contrary to the antiferromagnetic exchange terms which are expanded from the neel order .",
    "that is the reason why nl@xmath9 models derived for antiferromagnetic ladder or alternating spin chain @xcite can not be straightforwardly applied to the present cases  : they are not built upon the same semiclassical configurations . note that since the measure element @xmath81 is a two - spin block , it is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the berry phases of the spins are of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the spatial variation of the field @xmath84 , and give @xmath85    since we sum up the contributions for a double two - spin block , we must divide the whole sum by a factor @xmath63 .",
    "we end up with @xmath86 + \\int dx dt \\left [ s^2(\\partial_x \\phi).\\phi\\wedge\\partial_t   \\phi + 2s{\\bf l}.\\phi\\wedge\\partial_t \\phi \\right],\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath87 for commodity .",
    "we recover a spin-2s topological @xmath88-term with @xmath89 .",
    "this has the consequence that the topological term does not contribute , so that the spin chain is likely to be gapped .",
    "we next integrate over the fluctuation fields , that is to say @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we then obtain the nl@xmath9 m action @xmath92.\\ ] ] the standard parameters of this nl@xmath9 m are the coupling constant @xmath58 and the velocity @xmath60 given by @xmath93 note that @xmath60 perfectly matches the velocity @xmath94 we found for the classical spin waves .",
    "when we make @xmath8 goes to infinity the coupling constant @xmath58 goes to @xmath95 and the velocity goes to @xmath42 .",
    "these are the expected parameters for the 2s - nl@xmath9 m .",
    "the hida s chain is build up of spin one half so that for @xmath96 @xmath58 goes to @xmath63 and @xmath60 to @xmath97 in units of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling .",
    "those are the parameters of a spin-1 chain of exchange @xmath98 .",
    "this is the limit found by hida for the alternating chain .",
    "let us recall why the magnitude of the exchange coupling should be so .",
    "indeed in this limit the ferromagnetic pairs are in a triplet state . because of rotation invariance",
    ", the limiting hamiltonian can be written as an effective spin-1 chain .",
    "the coupling can only be quadratic @xmath99 or quartic @xmath100 .",
    "the quartic term is excluded in this limit because it corresponds to second order perturbation theory in @xmath101 .",
    "the prefactor in front of the spin-1 coupling can be determined with the help of the calculation of a single matrix element , which is easily done on the all - spin - up configuration and yields @xmath102 . so that in this limit , our nl@xmath9 m is consistent with hida s argument .",
    "to evaluate the spin gap , we compute the mass generated by the nl@xmath9 m in the limiting case of a large number of components for the field @xmath56(@xmath104 ) . in that limit",
    "a closed expression can be obtained for it , thanks to the large n saddle - point approximation .",
    "so we made @xmath56 a n - component field and rescaled it by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "we then enforce the unitary constraint on @xmath56 by means of a conjugate field @xmath106 , so that the unconstrained partition function is @xmath107    the saddle point equation for the complete action can now be safely derived , and we may look for a constant solution for @xmath106 that we will call @xmath108 . in the limit of large @xmath103 , @xmath109 is the mass generated by the nl@xmath9 m .",
    "@xmath110    in the limit @xmath8 goes to @xmath111 , the chain is totally dimerized and the velocity @xmath60 goes to @xmath111 . because of this unusual feature , and also because we wish to derive results valid for a large range of @xmath8 , we will not resort to a radial cut - off in the euclidean space - time of the nl@xmath9 m .",
    "rather we will first integrate on frequencies , then integrate on the momenta , with a large - momenta cut - off @xmath112 .",
    "so that instead of the usual radial cut - off , we integrate over a strip in the plane @xmath113 along the @xmath29-axis .",
    "the reason for this is that when @xmath8 goes to 0 , the prefactor @xmath114 of @xmath115 goes also to zero whereas the prefactor @xmath116 of @xmath117 remains constant so that large frequencies are more and more relevant and must not be cut off . in the process ( which actually corresponds to the decoupling of dimers ) , we lost the space dimension of space - time .",
    "the first integration is over @xmath29 and gives @xmath118 then integrating over @xmath30 we can extract the mass of the nl@xmath9 m @xmath119 in the standard derivation of the mass generated by the nl@xmath9 m ( see for example @xcite ) one would exchange the function hyperbolic sine for the function exponential . indeed , in order for this computation to make sense",
    "we must have @xmath120 .",
    "since in the nl@xmath9 m related to the spin-2s chain , @xmath121 is finite , the ( then meaningless ) hyperbolic sine function can be replaced with the exponential function . yet for our alternating chain , it ca nt be done since in the limit @xmath8 goes to @xmath111 the argument of the function vanishes .",
    "hence to encompass the full range of @xmath8 we must retain the hyperbolic sine function .",
    "now we can evaluate the energy gap  : @xmath122    whatever the spin magnitude @xmath42 , the gap of an antiferromagnetic pair of spins is equal to the gap between the triplet state and the singlet , i.e. @xmath2 . hence when @xmath123 , we can determine that @xmath91 goes to @xmath124 .",
    "this statement allows us to determine the cut - off which appears to be @xmath12 ( actually @xmath125 but we set @xmath87 ) .",
    "we can then write  : @xmath126    we have obtained a _ self - contained _ , estimate of the chain gap for the spin magnitude @xmath42 . for the spin-1 chain",
    "we obtain @xmath127 , which is @xmath128 far from the numerically @xcite known @xmath129 .",
    "we expect a better result for the spin-2 chain , closer to the `` large spin limit '' .",
    "we obtain @xmath130 , which is @xmath131 fairly close to the numerically @xcite known value of @xmath132 . as for the correlation lengths",
    ", we obtain @xmath133 to compare with the numerically known @xmath134 whereas we obtained @xmath135 to compare with the numerical value @xmath136 .",
    "the figures labeled 3 and 4 are drawings of the curves of the spin gap w.r.t .",
    "@xmath137 in the range @xmath138 $ ] and @xmath139 in the range @xmath140 .",
    "we did so in order to compare our results to hida s presentation of his numerical computation @xcite .",
    "our result agrees qualitatively on the whole range of @xmath8 including the limiting case @xmath8 goes to zero .    to check that our nl@xmath9 m approach is still valid in the limit @xmath8 goes to zero",
    ", we can also compute the correlation length .",
    "it can be read on the saddle point equation  : @xmath141 .",
    "then we get  : @xmath142 we check that the correlation length goes to zero like @xmath143 when @xmath123 , which is expected since at this point the chain is made of decoupled dimers .",
    "in ref .  ( @xcite ) , s.  r. white introduced several mappings that interpolate smoothly between spin ladders and a spin-1 chain within the haldanespin gap phase . here",
    "we treat one of these mappings .",
    "it consists in an antiferromagnetic spin ladder with an additional diagonal bond in every plaquette formed by legs and rungs ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the exchange coupling associated to this bond is ferromagnetic ( we will denote it as @xmath144 ) and does not introduce any frustration in the ladder .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath145 where all exchange couplings are chosen positive .",
    "when @xmath144 goes to @xmath111 we recover the usual antiferromagnetic spin ladder .",
    "whereas in the limit @xmath146 goes to infinity , the pairs of ferromagnetically bounded spin are in a triplet state .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can then be expanded by rotational invariance in terms of spin-1 couplings . the effective antiferromagnetic coupling constant is then evaluated on any matrix element of the hamiltonian and gives @xmath147 .",
    "so this limit corresponds to an antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain . since in the process",
    ", we remain in the haldane gapped phase , we may apply our scheme to obtain an estimate of the gap as a function of the diagonal coupling @xmath144 .      the microscopic pattern of the ladder is composed of the four spins @xmath148 , and @xmath149 forming a square and , apart from the diagonal bond , three bonds : one on each leg , and the last one on one of the two rungs closing the square ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "as for the hida s chain case calculations are done on a doubled cell .",
    "possible candidates to spin pairs forming a nl@xmath9 m are the nearest neighbours on the same leg .",
    "pairs of site linked by a rung contribute to the same nl@xmath9 m .",
    "then , we will need only one extra fluctuation field to describe of fluctuating paths inside the elementary cell , _ before _ going to the continuous limit .",
    "accordingly the coherent states fields are decomposed as  : @xmath150    in the following we set @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 so that the coupling constants are expressed in units of the longitudinal antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath154 .",
    "one can then expand the coupling terms in the action , which yields  : @xmath155\\ ] ] with the same care for the ferromagnetic bonds as was done previously .",
    "like for the hida s chain the measure element @xmath81 is a two - spin block and is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the berry phases of the spins are of the form @xmath156 and give @xmath157    since we sum up the contributions for a double two - spin block , we must divide the whole sum by @xmath63 .",
    "we end up with  : @xmath158 + \\int dxdt   \\left [ 2{\\bf l}s\\phi\\wedge\\partial_t \\phi \\right]\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath87 .",
    "we next integrate over the fluctuation fields , that is to @xmath54 and @xmath91 .",
    "so that we finally obtain the nl@xmath9 m action @xmath159.\\ ] ] the standard parameter of this nl@xmath9 m are @xmath160    now in order to stick to white s notations , we set @xmath161 to get  : @xmath162 these are the coupling and the velocity of the effective nl@xmath9 m .      a line of reasoning similar to hida s chain treatment can be applied to this nl@xmath9 m . in the large n - component limit",
    ", we can derive a saddle point equation and obtain the generated mass .",
    "the energy gap is then given by @xmath163 note that contrary to the hida s chain case , it is not meaningful to stick to the hyperbolic sine function , since it is not more precise than the function exponential . with the previously computed coupling constant @xmath58 and velocity @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath164 since when @xmath165 , we should recover 3/4 of the gap @xmath166 of the spin-1 chain , we can rewrite it as  : @xmath167 .\\ ] ]    hence we can relate the spin gap of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain to the spin gap of the antiferromagnetic two - leg spin @xmath97 ladder by the formula  : @xmath168.\\ ] ]    with the value @xmath169 , we obtain the estimate @xmath170 , close to the known@xcite value @xmath171 . in figure 5 , we have drawn the curve of the normalized spin gap @xmath172 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath173 . we can compare the curve with data from white@xcite .",
    "not only does our result agree qualitatively , but it is also quantitatively quite good .",
    "we have constructed non - linear sigma models appropriate to the description of the properties of some generalized spin chains including ferromagnetic exchanges . in the case of the alternating ferro - antiferromagnetic spin chain ,",
    "our treatment reproduces correctly the smooth crossover from decoupled dimers to the haldane phase .",
