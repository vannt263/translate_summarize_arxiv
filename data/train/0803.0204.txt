    "the vertical to horizontal kinetic energy ratio is plotted as a function of depth in figure [ layer ] .",
    "the unit depth is the shear wavelength inside the layer and the interface between the layer and the half - space lies at about 0.2 unit depth .    .",

    "the lower boundary is located at a depth of 5.25@xmath229 ( top ) and 42@xmath229 ( bottom ) , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the locked - mode approximation , two situations were considered where the rigid boundary is located at 5.25 and 42 wavelengths below the bottom of the layer . in the former case ,",
    "7 love and 11 rayleigh modes were found , while in the latter case we identified a total 56 love and 88 rayleigh modes . in the generalized eigenfunction expansion method ,",
    "only the fundamental love and rayleigh modes are present .",
    "thus , in the locked - mode method , the higher love and rayleigh modes serve as an approximation for the propagating @xmath0 and @xmath65 waves incident from below the layer . as illustrated in figure [ layer ] , the agreement between the two methods is extremely good and as expected , improves as the depth of the rigid boundary increases . in the vicinity of the layer ,",
    "the vertical to horizontal kinetic energy ratio shows rapid variations and , at greater depth , converges towards the ratio of a homogeneous space . in figure",
    "[ softlayer ] , we investigate the frequency dependence of the @xmath230 kinetic energy ratio at the surface of a solid with a soft layer at the surface , where the shear velocity and density are reduced by a factor 2 with respect to the underlying poisson half - space . the ratio of longitudinal to shear wavespeeds in the layer is taken to be 2.5 . to facilitate the interpretation of the @xmath230 calculations , we show in the top panel the normalized density of states of body , rayleigh and love waves as a function of frequency .",
    "the frequency unit is the fundamental resonance frequency of the layer for vertically propagating shear waves , @xmath231 , where @xmath18 is the shear wavespeed and @xmath232 is the layer thickness . in figure [ softlayer ] , we have also indicated high- and low - frequency asymptotics of the @xmath230 energy ratio . at high frequency , we expect the waves to be largely insensitive to the properties of the underlying half - space .",
    "we therefore calculate an approximate high - frequency @xmath230 ratio by replacing the true model with a simple half - space where the @xmath0 to @xmath65 velocity ratio equals 2.5 .",
    "the expected value is 0.513 , in good agreement with the full calculations . at low - frequency",
    ", we can neglect the presence of the shallow layer to recover the classical 0.56 ratio at the surface of a poisson solid .",
    "the @xmath230 ratio is slightly smaller at high frequencies mainly because of the increased amount of horizontally polarized shear waves . to the contrary",
    ", the @xmath230 energy ratio of the rayleigh wave tends to increase with the @xmath0 to @xmath65 velocity ratio .",
    "close to the resonance frequency @xmath233 of the layer , the vertical to horizontal kinetic energy ratio drops dramatically .",
    "careful analysis reveals that this is caused by the increasing contribution of the fundamental love mode to the density of states at the surface .",
    "around twice the resonance frequency , the @xmath230 ratio presents a marked overshoot which is due to the appearance of rayleigh waves higher modes ( i.e. body waves trapped in the low velocity layer ) which are preferentially polarized on the vertical axis . at high frequencies ,",
