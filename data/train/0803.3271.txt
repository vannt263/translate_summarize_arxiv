    "a typical hamiltonian system shows a phase space in which regions of regular motion and chaotic dynamics coexist .",
    "these systems are known as mixed systems .",

    "elliptic periodic orbits appear surrounded by islands .",

    "there are three main scenaria of transition to global chaos in finite - dimensional ( nonextended ) dynamical systems , one via a cascade of period - doubling bifurcations , a lorenz system - like transition via hopf and shilnikov bifurcations , and the transition to chaos via intermittency @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that there are other ( presumably many more ) such scenaria in extended ( infinite - dimensional ) dynamical systems .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the specification of a wave function is always related to a certain basis . in integrable systems",
    "the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian is known in principle . in this basis",
    ", each eigenfunction has just one component .",
    "that obviously indicates the absence of complexity . in the nearly ordered regime , mixing of quantum states belonging to adjacent levels can be ignored and the energy levels are uncorrelated .",
    "the level - spacing distribution is well described by that for random numbers generated by a poissonian process , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spacing between adjacent energy levels rescaled to unit mean spacing @xmath3 . for a hamiltonian with a chaotic classical limit , on the other hand the wavefunction components are on average uniformly distributed over the whole basis .",
    "berry @xcite conjectured that the wavefunctions of chaotic quantum systems can be represented as a formal sum over elementary solutions of the laplace equation in which the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients are independent identically - distributed gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance computed from the normalization .",
    "bohigas et al . @xcite put forward a conjecture ( strongly supported by accumulated numerical and experimental evidence and also by recent advances towards a proof of this conjecture @xcite ) that the spectral statistics of chaotic systems follow random - matrix theory ( rmt , see @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of a chaotic hamilton operator can thus be modeled by an ensemble of random hermitian matrices @xmath4 that belongs to one of three universality classes , either the orthogonal , the unitary or the symplectic one and is called gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) and symplectic ( gse ) ensemble , respectively .",
    "the theory is based on two main assumptions : the matrix elements are independent identically - distributed random variables and their distribution is invariant under unitary transformations .",

    "information about the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath8 can be obtained by integrating over the undesired variables .",
    "there is strong evidence by now , that indeed the spectral correlation functions of a chaotic system are well decribed by those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) and determined solely by the global symmetries of the system such as time - reversal invariance and the value of the spin . among the measures representing spectral correlations , the nearest - neighbor level - spacing distribution ( nnsd ) @xmath9 has been studied extensively so far . for the random matrix ensembles eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) it is well approximated by the wigner - dyson distribution , namely @xmath10 , where @xmath11 (= 1 , 2 , and 4 for the orthogonal , the unitary , and the symplectic ensembles , respectively ) characterizes the universality classes .",

    "the distribution function is proportional to @xmath18 , which implies that adjacent energy levels repel each other .",
    "this behavior may be attributed to the mixing between the two states related with these levels .",
    "so far in the literature , there is no rigorous statistical description for the transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "the nature of the stochastic transition is more obscure in quantum than in classical mechanics , as the assumptions that lead to the rmt description do not apply to mixed systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of a typical mixed system can be described as a random matrix where some of its elements are randomly distributed and some of them might be non - random .",
    "moreover , the matrix elements need not all have the same distributions and may or may not be correlated .",
    "thus , the rmt approach is a difficult route to follow .",
    "comprehensive semiclassical computations have been carried out for hamiltonian quantum systems , which on the classical level have a mixed phase space dynamics ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there have been several proposals for phenomenological random matrix theories that interpolate between the wigner - dyson rmt and banded random matrices with an almost poissonian spectral statistics .",
    "the standard route for the derivation is to sacrifice basis invariance but keep matrix - element independence .",
    "the first work in this direction is due to rosenzweig and porter @xcite .",
    "they model the hamiltonian of a mixed system by a superposition of a diagonal matrix with random elements and a matrix drawn from a goe .",
    "accordingly , the variances of the diagonal elements of the total hamiltonian are not twice that of the off - diagonal ones , as in the goe case .",
    "hussein and pato @xcite used the maximum entropy principle to construct such ensembles by imposing additional constraints .",
    "also , ensembles of banded random matrices whose entries are equal to zero outside a band of width @xmath19 along the principal diagonal have been used to model mixed systems @xcite .",
    "another route for generalizing rmt is to conserve base invariance but allow for the correlation of matrix elements .",
    "this has been achieved by maximizing non - extensive entropies subject to the constraint of a fixed expectation value of tr@xmath20 , see evans , toscano , nobre , abul , bertuola , abul1,abul2 .",
    "recently , an equivalent approach was presented in @xcite , which is based on the method of superstatistics ( statistics of a statistic ) proposed by beck and cohen @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been elaborated and applied successfully to a wide variety of physical problems , e.g. , in cohen , beck , beckl , salasnich , sattin , reynolds , ivanova , beckt . in thermostatics ,",
    "superstatistics arises from weighted averages of ordinary statistics ( the boltzmann factor ) due to fluctuations of one or more intensive parameters ( e.g. the inverse temperature ) .",
    "its application to rmt assumes the spectrum of a mixed system as made up of many smaller cells that are temporarily in a chaotic phase .",

    "( [ ge ] ) according to a probability density @xmath22 .",

    "the present paper is concerned with a justification for the use of the above - mentioned superstatistical generalization of rmt in the study of mixed systems , based on the representation of their energy spectra in the form of discrete time series in which the level order plays the role of time .",
    "the representation of the suitably transformed eigenvalues of a quantum system as a time series has recently allowed to determine the degree of chaoticity of the dynamics of the system relano , gomez , santhanam , manimaran , santhanam1 .",
    "we have thus been motivated by the work of beck , cohen and swinney @xcite concerning the derivation of superstatistics starting from time - series .",
    "superstatistical thermostatics results as a convolution of two statistics , one characterized by the boltzmann factor and the other corresponding to inverse - temperature fluctuations .",
    "this requires the existence of two relaxation times .",
    "we apply the arguments of @xcite by representing the spectra of mixed systems as discrete time series in which the role of time is played by the level ordering . in section",
    "ii , we consider two billiards with mushroom - shaped boundaries as representatives of systems with mixed regular ",
    "chaotic dynamics and three with the shape of limaon billiards , one of them of chaotic and two of mixed dynamics . the quantum eigenvalues and statistical properties of the eigenfunctions were obtained experimentally by exploiting the equivalence of the schrdinger equation of a plane quantum billiard and the helmholtz equation for the electric field strength in a cylindrical microwave resonator for wave lengths longer than twice the height of the resonator .",
    "the billiards with mixed dynamics have classical phase spaces of different structures for the two families of billards .",
    "the `` time - series '' analysis of their spectra manifests the existence of two relaxation lengths , a short one defined as the average length over which energy fluctuations are correlated , and a long one that characterizes the typical linear size of the heterogeneous domains of the total spectrum .",
    "it is performed in an attempt to clarify the physical origin of the heterogeneity of the matrix - element space , which justifies the superstatistical approach to rmt .",
    "the second main result of this section is to derive a parameter distribution @xmath22 , which is introduced in eq .",

    "this paves the way for the generalization of the wigner surmise to superstatistics concerning the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) .",

    "section iv introduces superstatistical generalizations for the porter - thomas distribution of partial widths .",

    "a brief summary of the main results is given in section v.",
    "billiards can be used as simple models in the study of hamiltonian systems .",
    "they consist of a point particle which is confined to a container of some shape and reflected elastically on impact with the boundary .",
    "the shape determines whether the dynamics inside the billiard is regular , chaotic or mixed .",
    "the best - known examples of chaotic billiards are the sinai billiard ( a square table with a circular barrier at its center ) and the bunimovich stadium ( a rectangle with two circular caps ) @xcite .",
    "neighboring parallel orbits diverge when they collide with dispersing components of the billiard boundary . in chaotic focusing billiards , neighboring parallel orbits",
    "converge at first , but divergence prevails over convergence on average . divergence and convergence are balanced in integrable billiards such as circles and ellipses .",
    "recently bunimovich introduced the so - called ` mushroom ' billiard bunimovichm with the novel feature of a well - understood divided phase - space comprising a single integrable region and a single ergodic one .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to mushroom billiards which consist of a semicircular region , the ` hat ' and a ` stem ' , which is symmetrically attached to its base . as the width of the stem varies from zero to the diameter of the hat",
    ", there is a continuous transition from integrability ( the semicircle billiard ) to ergodicity ( in case of a rectangul stem the stadium billiard ) . in mushroom billiards ,",
    "the regular region has a well - defined semicircular border about the center of the hat with radius equal to half the width of the stem .",
    "it is composed of those trajectories in the hat that never cross this border and therefore remain in the hat forever .",
    "their integrability is due to the conservation of the reflection angle for collisions with the semicircular boundary .",
    "the chaotic component consists of trajectories that enter the stem of the mushroom billiard .",
    "in contrast to most other mixed systems , the dynamics of mushroom billiards is free of the usual hierarchies of kam islands about integrable islands in phase space .",
    "because of its sharply - divided phase space , mushroom billiards can be thought of as an ideal model for the understanding of mixed dynamics .",
    "they indeed have already been under active research @xcite .",
    "the limaon billiard is a closed billiard whose boundary is defined by the quadratic conformal map of the unit circle @xmath24 to @xmath25 , @xmath26    the shape of the billiard is controlled by a single parameter @xmath27 with @xmath28 corresponding to the circle and @xmath29 to the cardioid billiard @xcite . for @xmath30 , the limaon billiard has a continuous and convex boundary with a strictly positive curvature and a collection of caustics near the boundary @xcite . at @xmath31 ,",
    "the boundary has zero curvature at its point of intersection with the negative real axis , which turns into a discontinuity for @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , there the caustics no longer persist [ 11 ] .",
    "the classical dynamics of this system and the corresponding quantum billiard have been extensively investigated by robnik and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the dynamics in the limaon billiard undergoes a smooth transition from integrable motion at @xmath28 via a soft chaos kam regime for @xmath33 to a strongly chaotic dynamics for @xmath34 .",
    "both families of systems have been studied experimentally in the quantum limit exploiting the analogy between a quantum billiard and a flat cylindric microwave billiard @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic resonances in a flat microwave cavity can directly be associated with quantum states in a quantum billiard of the same geometry . for the evaluation of statistical measures ,",
    "a sufficiently large number of resonances is needed .",
    "experimentally , this is not trivial since each resonance has a finite width , and as the level density increases with frequency , single resonances can only be resolved up to a certain frequency .",
    "hence , to measure as many states as possible , one has to reduce the width of the resonances by reducing the loss mechanisms .",
    "this is achieved by the use of superconducting cavities , which are cooled down to the temperature of liquid helium , @xmath35  k , in a bath cryostat .",
    "the cavities are either made of niobium or of copper plates , which have been galvanically covered with a layer of lead , whose thickness is several penetration depths of the electromagnetic field .    electric field oscillations in the interior of the cavity can be excited via antennae . using a vectorial network analyzer , the complex amplitude ratio of input to output signal from the cavity can be measured .",
    "peaks in the modulus of the amplitude are found at resonance frequencies , corresponding to eigenmodes of the system .",
    "there , the wave field forms a standing wave . it can be only excited when the antennae used in the measurement process are not near nodal lines of the wave function , where the amplitude is very small .",
    "thus , usually several antennae are used to measure different spectra , enabling to identify _ all _ resonances up to a certain frequency . for flat resonators of a length scale of 30 cm ,",
    "one collects approximately the first 800 eigenvalues with a very high precision .",
    "experimental data of both kinds of systems considered in this paper have been obtained via this procedure @xcite .",
    "two mushroom billiards have been recently investigated experimentally . in order to avoid symmetry effects and bouncing ball orbits between parallel walls in the stem ,",
    "their shape is of a half mushroom with a slant stem ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ spectr ] .",
    "the ratio of the width of the stem to the diameter of the hat is 1:3 ( 2:3 ) for the small ( large ) mushroom billiard .",
    "the degree of chaos , which is the measure of all chaotic parts of the phase space , is 45.5  @xmath36 ( 82.9  @xmath36 ) , and the first 780 ( 938 ) resonances could be detected .        in fig .",
    "[ spectr ] we show a part of the spectra of the small and large mushroom billiard , respectively . details of the experiment with the larger mushroom billiard can be found in @xcite .",
    "three desymmetrized cavities with the shape of billiards from the family of limaon billiards have been constructed for the values @xmath37 and the first 1163 , 1173 and 942 eigenvalues were measured , respectively .",
    "more details on these experiments are given in @xcite .",
    "to compare the statistical properties of the eigenvalues with universal predictions considered in the present paper , they have to be rescaled to unit mean spacing .",
    "this is done by an unfolding procedure using weyl s formula @xcite , which relates the billiard area and circumference to the number of resonance frequencies below a given one .    as outlined above ,",
    "the phase space structure of the billiards with mixed dynamics are different for the two families under consideration .",
    "the experimental nnsd of the larger of the two mushroom billiards exhibits friedrich a statistically significant dip at @xmath38 .",
    "it vanishes when the contribution of the two shortest periodic orbits is subtracted .",
    "such a dip has never been observed in the spectra of other billiards with mixed dynamics , including the limaon billiards considered here .",
    "we shall show below that nevertheless the statistical properties of the limaon billiards are indistinguishable from those of the mushroom billiards after removal of the contribution of these periodic orbits , in spite of the difference of their phase space structure .",
    "in this section the time series method used for the study of the fluctuations of the resonance spectra of the mushroom billiards is introduced . representing energy levels of a quantum system as a discrete time series has been probed in a number of recent publications .",
    "relao et al .",
    "@xcite considered a sequence of energy levels as a discrete time series in which the energy played the role of time .",
    "they conjectured that the power spectra of chaotic quantum systems are characterized by @xmath39 noise , whereas integrable quantum systems exhibit @xmath40 noise .",
    "this conjecture was supported by numerical experiments which involved classical random - matrix ensembles and atomic nuclei .",
    "moreover , the power spectrum of an experimentally modeled quantum sinai billiard exhibits a clear @xmath39 noise through almost the whole frequency domain .",
    "mixed systems on the other hand , like the limaon billiard , the quartic coupled oscillator , and the kicked top , are characterized by a @xmath41 noise gomez , santhanam . in all these cases , the exponent @xmath42 was related to the degree of chaos .",
    "manimaran et al .",
    "@xcite recently developed awavelet based approach to discrete time series and employed it to characterize the scaling behavior of spectral fluctuations of random matrix ensembles , as well as complex atomic systems .",
    "santhanam et al .",
    "santhanam1 studied the spectra of atoms and gaussian ensembles using the detrended fluctuation analysis , which is a popular tool to study long range correlations in time series @xcite .",
    "they showed that this analysis is related to the @xmath43 statistics of rmt .    here",
    "we apply the time - series analysis to the study of the energy spectra of mixed systems from another point of view .",
    "our goal is to test the hypothesis that quantum systems can be modeled by a generalization of rmt sust1,sust2 based on the concept of superstatistics @xcite .",
    "we follow an approach recently proposed by beck , cohen and swinney @xcite , which describes how to proceed from a given experimental time series to a superstatistical description .",
    "this approach allows one to check whether a time series contains two separate time scales , and also to extract the relevant probability densities of superstatistical parameters from the time series .",
    "superstatistical rmt assumes that the space of matrix elements consists of many spatial cells with different values of some intensive parameter , e.g. the inverse variance @xmath21 . in systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics",
    ", the origin of this spectral heterogeneity is the possible partial conservation of an unknown or ignored symmetry . in the space of matrix elements",
    "each heterogeneous domain comprises those matrix elements that couple states , which have similar properties with respect to this symmetry , where the typical size of the heterogeneous cells @xmath44 measures the correlation length in that space .",
    "the heterogeneity of the space of matrix elements presumably causes one in the structure of the spectrum .",
    "each cell is assumed to reach local equilibrium very fast , i.e. , the associated relaxation length @xmath45 , which is defined as that length - scale over which energy fluctuations are correlated , is short .",
    "it may also be regarded as an operational definition for the average energy separation between levels due to level repulsion . in the long - term run , the stationary distributions of this inhomogeneous system arise as a superposition of the `` boltzmann factors '' of the standard rmt , i.e. @xmath46 . the parameter @xmath47 is approximately constant in each cell for an eigenvalue interval of length @xmath44 . in superstatistics",
    "this superposition is performed by weighting the stationary distribution of each cell with the probability density @xmath48 to observe some value @xmath21 in a randomly chosen cell and integrating over @xmath21 .",
    "of course , a necessary condition for a superstatistical description to make sense is the condition @xmath49 , because otherwise the system is not able to reach local equilibrium before the next change takes place .",
    "our goal is to show that the behavior of a fictitious time series formed by the 780 and 938 resonances , respectively , in the two mushroom billiards , and the approximately 1100 resonances in each of the three limaon billiards is consistent with superstatistics . for this purpose",
    "the distribution @xmath48 is derived by proceeding as in @xcite .",
    "we extract the relaxation lengths ( times ) to local equilibrium @xmath45 and the large length scale @xmath44 on which the intensive parameter fluctuates and show that there is a clear scale separation of the spectral correlations in each billiard .",
    "first , let us determine the long time scale @xmath44 .",
    "for this we divide the spacings series into @xmath50 equal level - number intervals of size @xmath51 .",
    "the total length of the spectrum is @xmath52 .",
    "we then define the mean local kurtosis @xmath53 of a spacing interval of length @xmath51 by@xmath54 here @xmath55 denotes a summation over an interval of length @xmath51 starting at level spacing @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is either the local average spacing in each spacing interval or the global average @xmath58 over the entire spacings series .",
    "we chose the latter one .",
    "in probability theory and statistics , kurtosis is a measure for the `` flatness '' of the probability distribution of a real - valued random variable .",
    "higher kurtosis means that a larger part of the contributions to the variance is due to infrequent extreme deviations , as opposed to frequent modestly sized ones .",
    "a superposition of local gaussians with local flatness three results in a kurtosis of three .",
    "we define the superstatistical level - number scale @xmath44 by the condition@xmath59 that is , we look for the simplest superstatistics , a superposition of local gaussians @xcite .",
    "if @xmath51 is chosen such , that only one value of @xmath2 is contained in each interval , then of course @xmath60 = 1 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath51 comprises the entire spacing series , then we obtain the flatness of the distribution of the entire signal , which will be larger than 3 , since superstatistical distributions are fat - tailed .",
