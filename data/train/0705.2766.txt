    "in this paper we continue the lineage of work on quantum brownian motion via the influence functional path - integral method of feynman and vernon@xcite used by caldeira and leggett@xcite to derive a master equation for a high - temperature ohmic environment , which corresponds to the markovian regime . following this , caldeira , cerdeira and ramaswamy ( ccr)@xcite derived the markovian master equation for the system with weak coupling to an ohmic bath , that was claimed to be valid at arbitrary temperature ( sec .",
    "[ sec - caldeira ] ) . at the same time unruh and",
    "zurek@xcite derived a more complete and general master equation that incorporated a colored noise at finite temperature .",
    "finally hu , paz and zhang ( hpz ) @xcite derived an exact master equation for a general environment ( arbitrary temperature and spectral density ) which preserves the positive definiteness of the reduced density matrix , an important property missed out in many earlier derivations .    for many calculations ,",
    "physicists often invoke markovian master equations as they are easier to solve owing to their having compact , functional representations .",
    "but one runs into trouble if one is interested in low temperatures , short times or non - ohmic baths , which likely fall under the non - markovian regime ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the hpz equation is capable of dealing with the full range of parameters for a general environment but its form is somewhat involved .",
    "for example the coefficients are represented by solutions to integro - differential equations and multiple integrals over green s functions . in this paper",
    "we present the correct ( _ cf .",
    "_ for instance ccr ) late - time non - markovian master equation in compact functional representation for arbitrary temperature and coupling strength ( sec .",
    "[ sec : latediff ] ) .",
    "additionally we obtain the coefficients for a large class of spectral densities and their time dependent form at times before the oscillator and reservoir have equilibrated .",
    "solutions to the hpz equation have been attempted before @xcite and the role of the master equation coefficients ( renormalized frequency , dissipation , diffusion , and anomalous diffusion coefficients ) has been discussed in the past .",
    "here we present complete solutions of the master equation .",
    "we consider a quantum oscillator under the influence of an external classical force that is linearly coupled to a thermal reservoir of quantum oscillators .",
    "the particle begins decoupled from the reservoir and uncorrelated with it , with a short switch - on time @xmath0 for the coupling .",
    "the master equation coefficients are derived for spectral functions which are laurent series in the frequency with ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off @xmath1 much larger than the system frequencies , and infrared ( ir ) cut - off @xmath2 much smaller than the system frequencies .",
    "these coefficients are calculated in detail for arbitrary temperature and arbitrary time after the switch - on time .",
    "the master equation is solved explicitly for this class of spectra , and the general solution for arbitrary coefficients is reduced to solving the classical equation of motion of a parametric oscillator .",
    "it is clearly shown how each coefficient enters into the solution and how the state evolves in time .",
    "the anomalous diffusion coefficient is actually an `` anti - diffusion '' term that keeps the position uncertainty finite even when the uv cut - off tends to infinity ( in contrast with the momentum uncertainty ) .",
    "having the solution gives us a plethora of information such as the late time thermal covariance [ eq .  ] and uncertainty function ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainty ] ) .",
    "these results generalize the work of anastopoulos and halliwell @xcite , who already found the late time state to be a gaussian and placed lower bounds on the uncertainty function which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "this also crystallizes the work of hu and zhang @xcite on the generalized uncertainty function for gaussian states .",
    "finally , we derive the master equation that includes the influence of a classical external force and solve the master equation in that case as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin our derivation of the master equation in sec .",
    "[ sec : master - ohmic ] with a quantum oscillator linearly coupled to a thermal reservoir of quantum oscillators . the spectral density here is assumed to be ohmic with high - frequency cut - off @xmath1 .",
    "the particle begins both _ decoupled _ from and _ uncorrelated _ with the reservoir .",
    "the coupling is turned off at the initial time @xmath3 and is switched on within a short time scale @xmath0 . at moderate times , @xmath4 ( but not necessarily @xmath5 ) , we have obtained the master equation coefficients as an expansion from zero temperature ( sec .  [ sec : master - low ] ) , as an expansion from high temperature ( sec .",
    "[ sec : master - high ] ) , and in closed form as an approximation that is exact at both zero and extreme temperatures ( sec .",
    "[ sec : master - approx ] ) .",
    "exact closed form solutions are possible in terms of various special functions , but they do not straightforwardly reveal the behavior seen in our expansions and approximations .",
    "most importantly , we have closed form solutions for the master equation coefficients at late times , @xmath6 , and arbitrary temperature ( sec .  [",
    "sec : master - late ] ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : master - laurent ] we extend these results first to analytic spectral functions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : master - power ] ) and then to laurent - series spectra ( sec .",
    "[ sec : master - laurent2 ] ) . with the inclusion of subohmic terms",
    "we must introduce a low frequency cut - off @xmath2 .",
    "we take both the uv and ir cut - offs to be very large and very small respectively and we only consider spectra that give contributions to the master equation coefficients no more divergent than in the ohmic case ( which has logarithmic dependence on the uv cut - off ) .",
    "this limits our study to equations of motion for the system trajectories with the same form as in the ohmic case and whose contributions to the master equation coefficients are not markedly different either .",
    "spectral densities of arbitrary powers have been studied numerically in the past , but we do not consider them as they correspond to classical paths that involve fractional calculus ( _ i.e. _ , integro - differential equations ) and would be difficult to solve analytically .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner ] we solve the master equation for this class of spectra .",
    "it is seen that the initial solution undergoes damped oscillations while evolving into a gaussian state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "all the cumulants of the wigner distribution are easily determined as functions of time ( sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner - sol ] ) .",
    "in particular we can provide the exact late - time uncertainty function ( sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainty ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner - gen ] we extend this solution to more general spectra , provided that one knows the form of the master equation coefficients .",
    "the solution to this master equation is reduced to solving for the motion of a classical parametric oscillator .",
    "it is seen that simple damped oscillations may now be parametric damped oscillations , otherwise the form of the solution is the same .    finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : force ] we extend the method of calzetta , roura , and verdaguer @xcite to include the influence of a classical force acting upon the oscillator .",
    "the master equation turns out to be what one would naively guess .",
    "we solve this master equation in sec .",
    "[ sec : force - sol ] and it is seen that the external force drives the mean around while the evolution of the variance remains unchanged and determined by the reservoir .    in the last section we conclude with a list of our findings and suggestions for their applications .",

    "we work with an ohmic bath so that the spectral density function is given by @xmath18 where @xmath1 is a high - frequency cut - off of the bath and @xmath19 is the dissipation frequency .",
    "we will be using this hard cut - off for all our calculations .",
    "gaussian and exponential decay cut - off functions , of the form @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , are also common choices .",
    "the system and environment begin decoupled at @xmath3 , but are fully engaged in a time @xmath22 which is assumed to be very short but non - zero . this time - dependent coupling",
    "is easily dealt with following the work of hu and matacz@xcite on the time - dependent problems where all parameters of the system and bath oscillators and their couplings are allowed to be time - dependent .",
    "when only the system - environment couplings are time - dependent , as in our case , the dissipation and noise kernels are given respectively by @xmath23 } \\coth{\\left ( \\frac { \\omega}{2 t } \\right ) } i(\\omega ) \\mbox{~ } \\theta_\\tau(t ) \\theta_\\tau(s ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and it tends to a dirac delta distribution in the limit @xmath25 . had we chosen a gaussian high - frequency cut - off function instead of a hard cut - off , we would have found the dissipation kernel to be the derivative of a gaussian distribution that corresponds to an alternative representation of the delta distribution in the infinite cut - off limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the integral for the noise kernel is more complicated , even without the cut - off .",
    "although it can also be expressed in terms of distributions , for the purposes of this paper it is best left to the last .      in hpz@xcite",
    "the system - environment coupling was taken to be constant in time , yet the system and environment were initially uncorrelated .",
    "this gives rise to initial `` jolts '' in the normal diffusion coefficient of the master equation with a characteristic time - scale of order @xmath26 and an amplitude proportional to @xmath1 , which diverges in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "it also gives rise to a delta - like term at the initial time in the equation of motion : @xmath28 in the limit of infinite cut - off this sudden frequency change gives an initial kick to the homogeneous solutions of the equation of motion , which can be seen as follows : @xmath29 thus , the classical paths experience a finite velocity change within an infinitesimal time . following the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite one can easily see that this kick translates into a distortion of the wigner distribution from the bare initial state to a shifted one @xmath30 one expects that this result , which corresponds to replacing @xmath31 with a dirac delta in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) , is a good approximation whenever all the relevant time - scales ( @xmath32 , @xmath19 and @xmath33 ) are much larger than @xmath34 .    the physical origin of the jolts in the coefficients of the master equation as well as other initial time divergences ( such as the divergent contributions to correlation functions of system observables that are due to divergent boundary terms at the initial time ( see appendix  d in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be understood as follows . in general",
    "when a system couples to an environment with an infinite number of modes , well - behaved states exhibit correlations with arbitrarily high - frequency modes .",
    "in contrast , states that are uncorrelated for sufficiently high frequencies ( and hence completely factorizable states in particular ) are pathological .",
    "for instance , they have infinite energy and their hilbert space is even unitarily inequivalent to the space of physical states , spanned by the basis of energy eigenvectors of the whole system hamiltonian including the system - environment interaction .",
    "( of course for a finite uv cut - off there are no divergences , but the potentially divergent terms are very sensitive to changes in the value of the cut - off . )",
    "physically acceptable initial states that correspond to the thermal equilibrium state for the whole system can be obtained using euclidean path integrals @xcite .",
    "however , the instantaneous preparation functions employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to produce other states in addition to the thermal equilibrium state still give rise to initial divergences , as explained in ref .   @xcite . in order to obtain finite results",
    ", one needs to prepare the new initial state within a non - vanishing time @xcite , which corresponds to a physically more realistic situation .",
    "the alternative approach that we follow here is to switch on the interaction smoothly within a time @xmath0 much longer than @xmath26 but shorter than any other relevant time - scale of the problem . in this way",
    "the factorized initial state , which is perfectly acceptable in the uncoupled case , becomes adequately correlated with the arbitrarily high - frequency modes in a regular fashion .    when adding the short time switch - on function to the spectral density to turn on the interaction gradually , the initial jolt is no longer present in the results for the master equation coefficients .",
    "moreover , the equation of motion exhibits a smooth transition between the decoupled and the coupled system without the term proportional to @xmath31 on the right - hand side : @xmath35 however , since the constant bare frequency @xmath36 is of order @xmath1 so as to cancel out the divergent contribution that arises when integrating out the environment and give a finite value of the renormalized frequency at late times ( larger than the switch - on time ) , the frequency will change significantly in a short period of time of order @xmath0 .",
    "as long as @xmath0 is much shorter than all the other relevant time - scales in the problem ( except for @xmath26 ) , the dynamics for @xmath4 can be obtained by approximating the time - dependent frequency by a delta function . more specifically , since the renormalized frequency changes within a characteristic time - scale of order @xmath0 and with an amplitude of order @xmath1 , it can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the asymptotic constant value for times much larger than @xmath0 , @xmath39 is a constant of order one , and @xmath40 is a function peaked at @xmath3 with amplitude of order @xmath41 and width of order @xmath0 that becomes a dirac delta in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath4 the dynamics is governed by @xmath43 note that @xmath44 if the switch - on time is sufficiently large to cure the initial divergences discussed above .    the term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom3 ] ) has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) .",
    "it will , therefore , give the same kind of initial kick to the solutions of the equation and generate the same kind of transformation of the reduced wigner function : @xmath45 this phase - space transformation has a jacobian with determinant equal to unity : @xmath46 therefore , it is simple to calculate renormalized expectation values in terms of bare expectation values and vice versa : @xmath47 we can immediately see that the normalization , linear entropy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : entropy ] ) and state overlap are all unchanged by the kick .",
    "we can also check that the heisenberg uncertainty relation is also preserved as follows .",
    "first , we start with the covariance matrix for @xmath9 and @xmath48 corresponding to the wigner distribution @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and which transforms in the following way under linear phase space transformations : @xmath53 hence , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : jacobian ] ) we have @xmath54 finally , one takes into account that @xmath55 corresponds to the formulation in terms of the wigner function of the generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation due to schrdinger @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to being real and normalized , a phase space distribution corresponds to the wigner function of a physical state only when the corresponding density matrix ( undoing the wigner transformation ) satisfies the condition @xmath58 . for gaussian distributions this is guaranteed if and only if eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncertainty1 ] ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "thus , the kick does not change whether a given gaussian distribution corresponds to a physical state . on the other hand , for non - gaussian distributions",
    "( [ eq : uncertainty1 ] ) is no longer a sufficient condition for that , but one can use the following argument .",
    "for a finite switch - on time , the frequency change simply corresponds to unitary evolution associated with a time - dependent hamiltonian , which leaves the eigenvalues of the density matrix non - negative . by continuity ,",
    "the limit of a very short switch - on time can not make these eigenvalues negative .",
    "if one is interested in studying the evolution of a certain state of the system properly correlated with the environment ( such as the global equilibrium states considered in ref .   @xcite or states prepared from those in a finite time ) one can always consider the reduced wigner function associated with that state and invert eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncertainty1 ] ) to obtain the corresponding initial wigner function before the interaction was switched on .",

    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) by @xmath7 . according to the discussion in the previous subsection , when considering times much larger than the switch - on time , its effect on the equation of motion can be approximated by a delta function , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom3 ] ) . since @xmath67 for @xmath68 , the contribution from the delta term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom3 ] ) vanishes when solving for the retarded propagator .",
    "therefore , it is indeed independent of the initial kick and given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom3 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : dxp1])-([eq : dpp1 ] ) is negligible provided that the behavior during the switch - on time is sufficiently regular , which is indeed the case .",
    "similarly , the behavior of the master equation coefficients during switch - on time , which we do not calculate here , will be sufficiently regular so that its contribution to the evolution of the reduced wigner function ( or density matrix ) is also negligible when considering times larger than @xmath0 and one only needs to include the effect of the kick on the initial wigner function , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase_trans2 ] ) .",
    "some clarification is in order here about the use of a finite frequency cut - off @xmath1 for the environment spectrum . having a finite cut - off in the frequency integral for the noise kernel , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise ] ) , is necessary to obtain a finite result for the coefficients of the master equation because , as it will be seen below , it gives rise to contributions to the diffusion coefficients that become logarithmically divergent in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the use of a finite cut - off in the frequency integral of the dissipation kernel is not required to obtain a finite result .",
    "in fact , for computational convenience we are going to take @xmath72 in this case because then the dissipation kernel becomes local and we just have to deal with an ordinary differential equation rather than an integro - differential one .",
    "one may object that treating the noise and dissipation kernels on a different footing could lead to inconsistencies ( _ e.g. _ the fluctuation - dissipation relation will not hold exactly any more , as pointed out by hpz @xcite with regard to the treatment of this problem in ref .",
    "however , our results are consistent when properly understood .",
    "if one considered an expansion of the exact master equation coefficients in terms @xmath1 , one would have leading terms of order @xmath73 , terms of order one and subdominant terms involving inverse powers of @xmath1 .",
    "our approach gives the right result for the @xmath73 and order - one terms : using the local approximation for the dissipation kernel only alters the result for the subdominant terms .",
    "this can be seen as follows . when integrating @xmath74 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta1 ] ) , with a sufficiently well - behaved function @xmath75 , one has @xmath76 this condition will indeed be satisfied in our case since all the other relevant time - scales in the problem are much larger than @xmath26 and all the functions that @xmath77 will be integrated with are regular and extremely uniform over that scale .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy between using the dirac delta function and using @xmath78 corresponds to terms of order @xmath26 or higher inverse powers , which give contributions to the master equation coefficients of order @xmath79 or higher .    in order to compute the coefficients of the master equation , we first perform the relatively simple time integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dxp1])-([eq : dpp1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "this is the regime where our explicit expressions are not accurate if the interaction is gradually switched on with a much longer characteristic time - scale , in which case the contribution to the diffusion coefficients from that period is very small .",
    "we close this subsection by pointing out that , since @xmath91 is where the @xmath153 divergence arises for the ohmic case , one could rig an infinite number of finite supraohmic anticoupling terms to cancel the divergence , though there is no physical motivation to do so .",
    "one could even ask whether we can both renormalize the diffusion coefficients and keep the bare frequency finite and unmodified , which amounts to requiring the following two conditions to hold simultaneously : @xmath205 the answer is obviously in the negative , at least not with finite couplings .      in this subsection",

    "however , there will be some non - trivial contribution to the diffusion coefficients that we analyze below .    for times",
    "longer than the switch - on time the only difference between the master equation for the laurent - series spectrum and the analytic spectrum lies in a modification of the contribution from the terms most sensitive to ir divergences , namely @xmath123 and @xmath106 .",

    "thus , in order to obtain the diffusion coefficients for a laurent - series spectral function of the type considered in this subsection , one just needs to introduce these simple substitutions in the expressions for the diffusion coefficients of the ohmic case : @xmath220 in summary , the supraohmic terms shift the bare frequency and @xmath91 integrals , and can be used to shift their values in the ohmic theory , whereas the subohmic terms shift the @xmath221 and @xmath123 integrals .",

    "of course this does not happen with the unsubtracted theory , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxdp3d - unren ] .",

    "in contrast , the position uncertainty is much smaller and finite in the limit @xmath27 ( this had already been noticed for gaussian wave - packets in ref .",
    "in fact , if the brownian particle is coupled to a reservoir at arbitrarily low temperature and arbitrarily strong coupling , .",
    "moreover , one needs to keep @xmath287 , which means that @xmath1 also tends to infinity as @xmath288 .",

    "we investigate the linear entropy  @xcite , which can be easily obtained from the wigner distribution as follows : @xmath291 in fourier space it becomes @xmath292 and using the result in eq .",
    "we finally get @xmath293 at the initial time the linear entropy is that of the initial state , and at late times it tends to @xmath294 .    alternatively , one can express the linear entropy in terms of an integral of the fourier - transformed reduced wigner function at the initial time by introducing the change of variables @xmath295 .",

    "the uncertainty at the initial and intermediate times should not violate the heisenberg uncertainty principle either . as a particular example , let us consider an initial state that corresponds to the ground state associated with the bare frequency . at the initial time",
    "the determinant is completely specified by the determinant of @xmath303 , which equals @xmath304 as a consequence of the cancellation between the large @xmath305 factor ( of the order of @xmath306 with @xmath307 ) and the small @xmath308 factor ( of order @xmath309 ) . however , after a very short time , when @xmath257 starts acquiring non - vanishing values , it will dominate the total contribution to @xmath308 and the linear entropy will increase suddenly ( this kind of behavior for the entropy was found in ref .",

    "it will relax to its thermal equilibrium values .      in situations more general than the laurent series spectrum and where the classical equation of motion involves fractional calculus ( _ i.e. _",
    ", it becomes an integro - differential equation rather than an ode ) , the master equation can be of a slightly more general nature , with additional time dependence in the frequency and the dissipation coefficients : @xmath310 the method for finding its solutions will be almost the same , except that solving for the characteristic curves of the fourier - transformed phase - space variables is now less straightforward due to the time dependence of @xmath240 , and the procedure followed to solve eq .   needs to be generalized .",
    "the system of odes that corresponds to @xmath311 can be decoupled through a process of differentiation and substitution that leads to the equations for a pair of independent parametric oscillators where solving one effectively solves the other up to an integral .",
    "the second order ode satisfied by @xmath312 is @xmath313 after solving it , @xmath314 can be simply obtained as @xmath315 alternatively , one can proceed in the reverse order as follows : @xmath316 solving for @xmath312 first appears to be simpler since everything is then linear in the coefficients .",
    "it is convenient to factor out the exponential growth , which reduces the ode to its undamped form : @xmath317 if one is able to solve this differential equation , which for simple enough functions could be performed with floquet analysis and variation of parameters , then the characteristic curves can be expressed in terms of the following matrix equation : @xmath318 where @xmath319 is the so - called transition matrix , which has many of the properties of an exponential and contains the parametric oscillatory behavior of the characteristic curves .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath320 tend to some asymptotic values at large times , then the behavior of @xmath319 tends to that of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "once the transition matrix is available one can apply exactly the same approach as above in order to solve the master equation .",
    "one starts by writing the master equation as @xmath321 next , one solves this linear ode in @xmath235 and , reexpressing the result in terms @xmath33 and @xmath250 , one can finally write the solution of the master equation as @xmath322 with @xmath323^{{\\!\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm t } } { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$}}^{{\\!\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm t } } ( s ) \\mathbf{d}(s ) { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$}}(s ) { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$}}^{-1}(t ) ds \\right ) .\\ ] ]    for ohmic - like coefficients , the qualitative behavior of the solution is very similar to that of the ohmic solution .",
    "the moments of the initial distribution will experience oscillatory decay and the solution will tend to a thermal equilibrium state at late times . in purely supraohmic regimes",
    "where @xmath324 vanishes , the initial state would remain with renormalized frequency . in purely subohmic regimes where @xmath324 grows quickly ,",
    "the initial state would vanish quickly .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a classical force @xmath325 acting on the quantum oscillator .",
    "this is done by introducing a time - dependent potential @xmath326 : @xmath327      to derive the form of the master equation we follow the method of calzetta , roura , and verdaguer @xcite as it is of a very general nature and can be adapted quite straightforwardly . in the presence of an external force the system action takes the following form in terms of the `` center of mass '' and `` relative '' coordinates , @xmath328 and @xmath329 : @xmath330 + f(s ) \\delta(s ) \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reduced wigner function can still be expressed as an average over a stochastic process and a distribution for the initial conditions as follows : @xmath331 where we used the notation @xmath332 in the last equation , and @xmath333 is now a solution to the langevin equation with the external force : @xmath334 differentiating with respect to time reveals the usual dissipation , renormalized harmonic potential and the classical force potential @xmath326 : @xmath335 after a functional integration by parts , the last term gives rise to the diffusion terms , with the following coefficients : @xmath336 eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin1 ] ) can be solved in the same way as in the case without external force to obtain @xmath333 .",
    "it is simply given by a homogeneous solution that contains all the information on the initial conditions , plus a convolution of the external force with the retarded propagator associated with the homogeneous part of the equation , plus a convolution of the stochastic source with the same retarded propagator . by the linearity of the functional derivative ,",
    "@xmath337 only depends on the retarded propagator , which is the same as in the case of no external force .",
    "therefore , the master equation has exactly the same form , except for the addition of the classical force in the potential derivative term of the poisson bracket : @xmath338      fourier transforming the phase - space variables , the master equation becomes @xmath339 this equation can also be solved via the method of characteristic curves , following the same method of the previous section : @xmath340 with the solution @xmath341",
    "which can be finally written as @xmath342 where @xmath343 one can see that just as all temperature dependence only appears in the second cumulant , or covariance , the external force only affects the first cumulant , or mean .",
    "the change in the evolution of the mean , given by eq .  , simply corresponds to adding the response to the external force . as with an ordinary driven oscillator ,",
    "the response is a convolution of the retarded propagator , which exhibits the natural oscillatory decay of the system , and the driving force .",
    "quantum brownian motion of an oscillator coupled to a thermal reservoir of quantum oscillators has been the canonical model for studying the environmental effects on a quantum system , even of macroscopc scale , such as quantum dissipation , diffusion , decoherence and entanglement .",
    "it also provides important information on quantum measurement , such as noise , fluctuations , correlations , uncertainty relation and standard quantum limit in mesoscopic systems .",
    "many experiments have been carried out for testing these processes .",
    "fifteen years ago an exact master equation @xcite for the reduced density matrix of the system were derived for a general environment of arbitrary spectral density and temperature .",
    "there are claims that exact solutions have been found @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on solutions to this equation for a fairly general set of physical conditions and analyze its salient features .",
    "we expect these solutions to be useful in realistic settings for the analysis of many problems which can be described by this model .    the first question we addressed concerns the initial time divergences .",
    "these divergences result from the sudden coupling of an initially uncorrelated system and environment .",
    "this situation is unphysical and can be resolved by switching on the system - environment interaction smoothly over a time - scale longer than the inverse of the characteristic uv cut - off scale of the environment .",
    "having switched on the coupling , the initial frequency of the oscillator , as it quickly evolves from the bare to the renormalized frequency , is the only remaining initial singular behavior .",
    "but this merely implies a transition from the bare initial state to a `` renormalized '' version of that state , which can be taken as the effective initial state for the subsequent regular evolution .",
    "we then solved the master equation coefficients for a general class of bilinear system - environment couplings , which includes any combination of ohmic and integer supraohmic and subohmic spectral densities with extreme cut - offs .",
    "although it is by no means a complete class of spectral densities , it is a privileged class in that the classical trajectories are determined by ordinary differential equations and not integro - differential or fractional differential equations . in that sense ,",
    "their dynamics is more classical . for these system - environment couplings ,",
    "we have solved the master equation coefficients for all temperature ranges , beyond weak coupling , and at all times after the short initial time - scale during which the coupling is switched on .",
    "this has enabled us to clarify the validity and shortcomings of previously obtained approximations and provide more general results .",
    "perhaps the most useful are our simple expressions for the master equation coefficients at late time [ eq .  - ] .",
    "they clearly reveal the existence of logarithmic divergences in the limit of infinite uv cut - off not only in the anomalous diffusion coefficient , but also in the normal one .",
    "these divergences can not be consistently subtracted and condition the possibility of obtaining meaningful results upon the existence of a physically well - motivated cut - off .    for the system - environment couplings under discussion , which all have local dissipation , we have also solved the master equation in its entirety .",
    "all initial states evolve into a given gaussian state corresponding to thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have obtained the covariance matrix for this state [ eq .  ] , and the corresponding uncertainty function ( sec .  [ sec : uncertainty ] ) .",
    "interestingly , arbitrarily strong coupling to a zero temperature reservoir will tend to localize the position with arbitrary precision . for more general systems with non - local dissipation",
    ", we have drastically reduced the task of solving the master equation to that of solving a one - dimensional classical parametric oscillator problem .",
    "the master equation solutions are parametrically similar to the case of local dissipation .",
    "the same kind of terms arise , including a thermal covariance , but it is not guaranteed that the system will relax to a thermal state .",
    "that of course depends upon the behavior of the classical trajectories .    finally , we extended the model of the quantum oscillator linearly coupled to a thermal reservoir of oscillators by including a classical driving force .",
    "this modifies the dynamics by driving the mean position and momentum around just as with a classical driven system . in this model we found that the force has no effect upon the width of the wave - packet or any cumulant other than the mean .",
    "these results may be useful for the study of low - temperature measurements of forced oscillators , which are relevant for experiments with nanomechanical resonators @xcite .",
