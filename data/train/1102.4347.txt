    "the extensive production of top quarks at the lhc and tevatron colliders offers the possibility to study @xmath13 interactions with high accuracy .",
    "in particular , in the recent years the cdf and d0 collaborations have been measuring the helicity fractions of the @xmath8 boson from top quark decays with increasing precision  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , we have recently considered contributions of effective operators of dimension six or less  @xcite contributing at tree level to the decay of an unpolarized top quark to a bottom quark and a @xmath8 gauge boson at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd @xcite .",
    "effects of such operators are suppressed within the standard model ( sm ) but might be enhanced by new physics ( np ) contributions .",
    "we found that nlo qcd effects can be significant for the transverse - plus helicity fraction ( @xmath14 ) of the @xmath8 by lifting the helicity suppression of the operators containing left - handed bottom quark fields .",
    "while it turns out that indirect constraints from radiative @xmath15 decay  @xcite already severely constrain possible np effects in this observable , we found that the cdf measurement of the longitudinal helicity fraction ( @xmath16 ) of the @xmath8 boson already provides the most stringent upper bound on the contributions of one of the np operators  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the effects in top quark decays mentioned above , anomalous @xmath17 interactions , with @xmath18 labeling quark flavor , might manifest themselves in rare flavor changing neutral current processes of @xmath5 mesons where loops involving top quarks play a crucial role . as already mentioned ,",
    "such effects have been analyzed in the radiative @xmath19 decay  @xcite resulting in restrictive bounds on effective operator contributions describing possible deviations in the @xmath20 decay properties from the sm .",
    "recently , possible np effects in the @xmath21 , mixing amplitudes have received considerable attention ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and references within ) . in particular within the sm , the @xmath22 mass difference and the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath23 are strongly correlated with the branching ratio @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the most recent global analyses point to a disagreement of this correlation with direct measurements at the level of 2.9 standard deviations  @xcite . similarly in the @xmath1 sector the recently measured cp - asymmetries by the tevatron experiments , namely in @xmath25  @xcite and in di - muonic inclusive decays  @xcite when combined , deviate from the sm prediction for the cp violating phase in @xmath26 mixing by 3.3 standard deviations  @xcite . in the present paper we consider anomalous @xmath17 interactions as a possible solution of these anomalies via their contribution to @xmath21 mixing amplitudes .",
    "similar analyses have been attempted recently  @xcite using a subset of all possible effective @xmath17 operators . in particular , the authors of  @xcite have constrained contributions of two possible @xmath13 operators using mostly @xmath0 oscillation parameter measurements , while in ref .  @xcite they considered two @xmath27 operators and concluded that the large non standard cp violating phase in @xmath26 mixing can be accommodated without violating @xmath15 constraints provided that the two np operator contributions conspire in a way to mostly cancel in the later process while at the same time significantly affect the former .",
    "an important issue to consider when interpreting indirect bounds on effective operators concerns the choice of flavor basis for the operators . since the sm electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) induces misalignment between the up and down quark mass eigenbasis and the weak interaction eigenbasis via the ckm mechanism , isolating np effects in @xmath17 interactions to a particular single ( e.g. @xmath28 ) flavor transition in the physical ( mass ) basis in general requires a large degree of fine - tuning in the flavor structure of the effective operators in the uv .",
    "this is the case in the existing analysis of anomalous @xmath27 effects in @xmath1 oscillations  @xcite .",
    "one possible solution is to require the operators to be diagonal ( aligned ) in the weak interaction basis as done for example in the @xmath15 analysis  @xcite .",
    "then , ewsb generically induces several @xmath29 flavor transitions , whose relative strengths are governed by the ckm matrix elements , resulting effectively in minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) scenarios  @xcite .",
    "this is also the approach we employ in this work , paying however special attention to the possible controlled breaking of such flavor universality by large bottom yukawa effects and their implications for new cp violating effects in @xmath21 mixing as recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , we focus our discussion on the operators which can be probed directly in the @xmath20 decay measurements , since this provides an exciting possibility to directly test the suggested origin of new cp violating sources in the @xmath4 systems at high energy colliders .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we introduce the model independent approach employed and define our effective lagrangian including the ( mfv ) flavor structure of the np operators mediating @xmath20 transitions above the ewsb scale . in the main part of the paper we describe the matching computation for passing from such effective theory to another low - energy effective theory relevant for @xmath4 meson mixing where the top quark and the electroweak gauge bosons have already been integrated out .",
    "our results are then combined with the recent global ckm and @xmath4 mixing fits to extract preferred ranges for the anomalous @xmath17 interactions and give corresponding predictions for the @xmath8 helicity fractions in the @xmath20 decays .",
    "we conclude our work in the last section .",
    "we work in the framework of an effective theory , described by the lagrangian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sm part , @xmath32 is the scale of np and @xmath33 are dimension - six operators , invariant under sm gauge transformations and consisting of sm fields . in doing this",
    "we assume that at the scale @xmath34 the sm fields with up to two higgs doublets are the only propagating degrees of freedom , that the electroweak symmetry is only broken by the vacuum expectation values of these two scalars and that operators up to dimension six give the most relevant contributions to the observables we consider .",
    "such an approach is appropriate to summarize weak scale effects of np at @xmath35 , where the new heavy degrees of freedom have been integrated out .",
    "our operator basis consists of all dimension - six operators that generate charged current quark interactions with the @xmath8 . since we restrict our discussion to mfv scenarios , lagrangian ( [ eq : lagr ] ) has to be formally invariant under the sm flavor group @xmath36 where @xmath37 stand for quark doublets and up and down type quark singlets respectively .",
    "mfv requires that the only @xmath38 symmetry breaking spurionic fields in the theory are the up and down quark yukawa matrices @xmath39 , formally transforming as @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "we identify four relevant quark bilinears with distinct transformation properties under @xmath38 : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 transforming as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . using these",
    ", we can construct the most general @xmath38 invariant quark bilinear flavor structures as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are arbitrary polynomials of @xmath52 and/or @xmath53 , transforming as @xmath47 .    in order to identify the relevant flavor structures in terms of physical parameters , we can without the loss of generality consider @xmath39 condensate values in a basis",
    "in which @xmath54 is diagonal : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where we have introduced separate up- and down - type higgs condensates @xmath57 , while @xmath58 is the sm ckm matrix .",
    "we also write @xmath59 in this basis in terms of quark mass eigenstates @xmath60 as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 subscripts denote chirality projectors @xmath65 .",
    "we consider first the simplest case of linear mfv where within @xmath66 higher powers of @xmath67 can be neglected .",
    "neglecting also contributions suppressed by first and second generation quark masses , the only relevant flavor contributions of the arbitrary @xmath51 structures in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flav ] ) are @xmath68 where summation over repeated @xmath69 flavor indices is understood .",
    "we note in passing that within np models where higher powers of yukawa insertions are suppressed by small perturbative parameters , the structures @xmath70 and @xmath71 are subleading compared to @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "notice that since @xmath74 is completely flavor universal , when coupled to the @xmath8 it would modify the effective fermi constant as extracted from charged quark currents compared to the muon lifetime .",
    "existing tight constraints on such deviations  @xcite do not allow for significant effects in @xmath4 or top quark phenomenology and we do not consider this structure in our analysis . on the other hand , @xmath70 potentially leads to large tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) in the down quark sector if coupled to the @xmath75 .",
    "this restricts the @xmath76 structure of such an operator in order to contribute significantly to charged current interactions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath71 if coupled to the photon or @xmath75 would generate large tree level fcnc @xmath77 transitions , which are already tightly constrained by @xmath15 and @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "since all the charged current mediating @xmath76 invariant operators of dimension six or less containing such a flavor structure do necessarily involve either the @xmath75 or the photon , we drop this structure from our subsequent analysis .    taking these considerations into account",
    ", we finally obtain the following relevant set of dimension six @xmath76 invariant effective operators mediating charged quark currents in linear mfv np scenarios @xmath79 \\big(\\phi_u^\\dagger{\\mathrm{i}}d_{\\mu}\\phi_d\\big ) \\ , , { \\nonumber}\\\\ { \\nonumber}\\mathcal q_{ll}&=&[\\bar q^{\\prime}_3\\tau^a\\gamma^{\\mu}q'_3 ] \\big(\\phi_d^\\dagger\\tau^a{\\mathrm{i}}d_{\\mu}\\phi_d\\big ) \\hspace{-0.1cm}-\\hspace{-0.1cm}[\\bar q'_3\\gamma^{\\mu}q'_3]\\big(\\phi_d^\\dagger{\\mathrm{i}}d_{\\mu}\\phi_d\\big),\\\\ { \\nonumber}\\mathcal q_{lrt } & = & [ \\bar q'_3 \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}\\tau^a t_r]{\\phi_u}w_{\\mu\\nu}^a \\,,\\\\   \\mathcal q_{lrb } & = & [ \\bar q_3 \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}\\tau^a b_r]\\phi_d w_{\\mu\\nu}^a \\,,\\label{operators } \\label{eq : ops1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath80 , @xmath81/2 $ ] , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are the up- and down - type higgs fields ( in the sm @xmath84 ) .",
    "the final set of operators coincides with those considered in the @xmath19 analysis  @xcite . within the formal mfv expansion , the operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 involving the right - handed @xmath87 quarks always appear with a pre - factor of the third eigenvalue of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "although not written out explicitly in ( [ eq : ops1 ] ) these operators are therefore expected to be parametrically suppressed compared to @xmath90 and @xmath91 . notice that starting with the most general mfv construction we are led to a set of operators , where largest deviations in charged quark currents are expected to involve the third generation ( a notable exception being the flavor universal @xmath74 structure present already in the sm ) .",
    "following  @xcite , the generalization of the above discussion to mfv scenarios where large bottom yukawa effects can be important is straight forward .",
    "higher powers of @xmath92 within @xmath51 effectively project to the third generation in the down sector yielding the following additional flavor structures @xmath93 again note that in np models where higher powers of yukawa insertions are suppressed by small perturbative parameters , these structures are subleading compared to @xmath74 , @xmath70 and @xmath94 respectively .",

    "<S> precise measurements of the top quark decay properties at hadron colliders offer interesting new possibilities of testing the standard model . at the same time , recent intriguing experimental results concerning cp violation in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems have stimulated many studies of physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate anomalous @xmath2 interactions as a possible source of new effects in @xmath3 oscillations within a model independent approach based on the assumptions of minimal flavor violation . after matching our effective operators onto the low - energy effective lagrangian describing @xmath4 meson mixing and evolving it down to the @xmath5-mass scale </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the preferred ranges of the anomalous @xmath2 interactions at the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> these values are then compared to previously considered constraints coming from the rare radiative @xmath6 decay . finally , we reconsider the associated effects in the @xmath7 decays and find that the @xmath8 helicity fractions @xmath9 can deviate by as much as @xmath10 , @xmath11 from their standard model values , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the deviations in @xmath12 in particular , can reach the level of expected precision measurements at the lhc . </S>"
