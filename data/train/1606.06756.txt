    "in particular , we showed that the sharp charge-@xmath13 steps which occur at @xmath303 and @xmath304 are broadened and are described by an analytic function of @xmath301 .",
    "considering the case of a large conductance , we found how the charge staircase is smeared out with @xmath297 , see eqs .",
    "we also identified the analogue of the even - odd transitions earlier known to occur in the case @xmath77 , if @xmath305 .",
