    "the @xmath6 family of nucleon resonances has many well established members  @xcite , several of which exhibit overlapping pole positions , very similar masses and widths , but different @xmath7 spin - parity values .",
    "apart from the @xmath8 state , the known photo - decay amplitudes have been determined from analyses of single - pion photoproduction , so the @xmath9 branching ratios are in general poorly known .",
    "evidently @xmath2-photoproduction data are required , and this work studies the region from threshold , where there are two closely spaced states : @xmath10 and @xmath8 , up to center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies of @xmath11  mev , encompassing a sequence of six overlapping states : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "compared to pion photoproduction , the @xmath2 channel has some advantages .",
    "isospin conservation requires that @xmath2 production probes only @xmath18 contributions , simplifying the extraction of individual @xmath6 properties .",
    "couplings of @xmath6s to the @xmath9 channel , in comparison with the @xmath19 couplings , may clarify the inner structure of resonances .",
    "new , high quality data on @xmath0 are needed to shed light on these issues , and the tagged - photon hall at mainz offers a state - of - the - art facility to obtain such data . here",
    "we report on a new differential - cross - section measurement , covering incident photon energies from threshold ( @xmath20  mev ) up to @xmath21  mev .",
    "the accumulation of @xmath22 events for the process @xmath4 has enabled the data to be binned finely in @xmath23 ( bin widths as small as @xmath24  mev ) and in @xmath2 production angle , which in the c.m .",
    "frame is fully covered .",
    "the present measurement is part of an extensive program at the mainz microtron to provide data of unrivaled quality on neutral meson photoproduction , which includes polarized beam and target observables in addition to cross sections .",
    "our energy range includes several well - established resonances and also some more questionable ones .",
    "indeed , the excellent photon - energy resolution offers the potential to illuminate any narrow states , possibly of exotic structure .",
    "most of the states presently covered appear to have very small coupling to the @xmath25 channel , and this in itself can be puzzling .",
    "for example , it is unclear why the @xmath9 branching ratio is so small for the second @xmath26 , @xmath12 , compared to the first @xmath8 .",
    "the data available for @xmath27 are inadequate to study this question  @xcite .",
    "the reason for a small branching ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath9  @xcite has to be understood , too .",
    "the particle - data - group ( pdg ) estimate for the a@xmath28 decay amplitude of the @xmath17 state is consistent with zero , while the recent said determination gives a small but non - vanishing value  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the disagreement between the pdg estimate for the a@xmath29 decay amplitude and the recent said determination @xcite is also unclear .",
    "other unresolved issues relate to the second @xmath30 and @xmath31 resonances [ @xmath16 and @xmath15 ] that are not seen in the recent @xmath19 partial - wave analysis ( pwa )  @xcite , contrary to other pwas used by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 decay channel could be more favorable than @xmath19 for these states .",
    "the present data should have sufficient precision to allow reliable extraction of the @xmath9 partial waves for these resonances , which will enhance our understanding of their internal dynamics .",
    "in addition , since the present data have good coverage of the @xmath33-threshold region , the s - wave dominance of the threshold behavior can also be checked .",

    "since the present data on @xmath34 were also used in the determination of the slope parameter @xmath35 for the @xmath36 decay  @xcite , a more detailed description of the experiment and data handling can be found in ref .",
    "the process @xmath37 was measured using the crystal ball ( cb )  @xcite as the central spectrometer and the two - arm photon spectrometer ( taps )  @xcite as a forward spectrometer .",
    "these detectors were installed in the tagged bremsstrahlung photon beam of the mainz microtron ( mami )  @xcite , with the photon energies determined by the glasgow tagging spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the cb spectrometer is a sphere consisting of 672 optically insulated nai(tl ) crystals , shaped as truncated triangular pyramids , which point toward the center of the sphere .",
    "each nai(tl ) crystal is 41  cm long , which corresponds to 15.7 radiation lengths .",
    "the crystals are arranged in two hemispheres that cover 93% of @xmath38 sr , sitting outside a central spherical cavity with a radius of 25  cm , which is designed to hold the target and inner detectors . to allow passage of the beam ,",
    "the regions of polar angle below @xmath39 and above @xmath40 are not populated .",
    "the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers in the cb can be described as @xmath41)^{0.36}$ ] .",
    "shower directions are determined with a resolution in @xmath42 , the polar angle with respect to the beam axis , of @xmath43 , under the assumption that the photons are produced in the center of the cb .",
    "the resolution in the azimuthal angle @xmath44 is @xmath45 .    to cover the forward aperture of the cb , the taps calorimeter  @xcite was installed 1.5  m downstream of the cb center .",
    "taps geometry is flexible and , for the present a2 experiment , it was configured as a  plug \" for the forward - angle hole in cb acceptance . in this experiment , taps was arranged in a plane consisting of 384 baf@xmath46 counters of hexagonal cross section , with an inner diameter of 5.9  cm and a length of 25  cm , which corresponds to 12 radiation lengths .",
    "one counter was removed from the center of the array , which has an over - all , hexagonal geometry in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane , to allow the passage of the photon beam .",
    "taps subtends the full azimuthal range for polar angles from @xmath49 to @xmath39 .",
    "the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers in the taps calorimeter can be described as @xmath50)^{0.5}$ ] .",
    "because of the relatively long distance from the cb , the resolution of taps in the polar angle @xmath42 was better than @xmath49 .",
    "the resolution of taps in the azimuthal angle @xmath44 is better than @xmath51 radian , where @xmath52 is the distance in centimeters from the taps center to the point on the taps surface that corresponds to the @xmath42 angle .",
    "the upgraded mainz microtron ,",
    "mami - c , is a four stage accelerator , and its latest addition ( the fourth stage ) is a harmonic double - sided electron accelerator  @xcite .",
    "an electron - beam energy of 1508 mev was used for the present experiment .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons , produced by electrons in a 10-@xmath53 m cu radiator and collimated by a 4-mm - diameter pb collimator , were incident on a 5-cm - long liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath46 ) target located in the center of the cb .",
    "the energies of the incident photons were analyzed up to 1402  mev by detecting the post - bremsstrahlung electrons in the glasgow tagger  @xcite .",
    "the tagger is a broad - momentum - band , magnetic - dipole spectrometer that focuses post - bremsstrahlung electrons onto a focal - plane detector , consisting of 353 half - overlapping plastic scintillators .",
    "the energy resolution of the tagged photons is mostly defined by the overlap region of two adjacent scintillation counters ( a tagger channel ) and the electron beam energy . for a beam energy of 1508  mev ,",
    "a tagger channel has a width about 2  mev at 1402  mev and about 4  mev at 707  mev ( the @xmath2-production threshold ) .",
    "tagged photons are selected in the analysis by examining the correlation in time between a tagger channel and the experimental trigger derived from cb signals .",
    "the lh@xmath46 target is surrounded by a particle identification ( pid ) detector  @xcite which is a cylinder of length 50 cm and diameter 12  cm , built from 24 identical plastic scintillator segments , of thickness 0.4  cm . in conjunction with the cb , this identifies charged particles by the @xmath54 technique , although this facility was not used in the present analysis .",
    "the experimental trigger had two main requirements .",
    "first , the sum of the pulse amplitudes from the cb crystals had to exceed a hardware threshold that corresponded to an energy deposit of @xmath55  mev .",
    "second , the number of  hardware \" clusters in the cb had to be larger than 2 . a  hardware \" cluster is a group of 16 adjacent crystals in which at least one crystal has an energy deposit larger than 30  mev .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath2 was measured by using the @xmath56 decay mode of this meson : @xmath57 the other main neutral decay mode , @xmath58 , was not used in this measurement because a large number of @xmath58 events did not satisfy the experimental - trigger requirements .",
    "the acceptance determination for the two - photon final state then becomes highly sensitive to the trigger efficiency , calculated using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . on the contrary ,",
    "the trigger efficiency for @xmath36 events is close to 100% , so the systematic uncertainty in the acceptance caused by the trigger simulation is small .",
    "additionally , the angular resolution for @xmath58 events is worse than for @xmath36 , and there is a substantial background from the @xmath59 reaction , which requires a careful subtraction .",
    "process  ( [ eqn : eta3pi0 ] ) was investigated by analysis of events having six and seven  software \" clusters reconstructed in both the cb and taps .",
    "the six - cluster sample was used to search for the events in which only six photons were detected , while for seven clusters the recoiling proton was also detected .",
    "the kinematic - fitting technique was used to test the reaction hypotheses needed in our analysis and to select good candidates for the events of interest .",
    "the details of our parametrization of the detector information and resolutions are given in ref .",
    "the events that satisfied the hypothesis of reaction ( [ eqn : eta3pi0 ] ) at the 2% confidence level , cl , ( i.e. , with a probability of misinterpretation less than 2% ) were accepted as @xmath36 candidates .",
    "the kinematic - fit output was then used to reconstruct the kinematics of the reaction . since each event in general included several tagger hits ( due to the high rates in the tagger detector ) , the @xmath60 hypothesis was tested for each tagger hit .",
    "selection was based on the hit time which was required to be within a selected window ( detailed below ) and the equivalent photon energy , which was required to be above the reaction threshold of 707  mev .",
    "the tagger - hit time distribution for @xmath36 event candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beameta_mamic](a ) .",
    "if an @xmath61 event candidate from one trigger passed the 2%  cl criterion for several tagger hits , they were analyzed as separate events .",
    "the width of the tagger - hit window was chosen to be substantially wider ( 80  ns for this analysis ) than the peak caused by prompt coincidences between the tagger and trigger .",
    "the width of the prompt window , denoted by vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : beameta_mamic](a ) , was taken to be 10  ns in order to include all prompt events . using a wider window for the random coincidences",
    "allowed the collection of a sufficient number of events to determine precisely the random - background distribution beneath the prompt peak .",
    "the experimental distributions analyzed with the pure random events were then used to subtract the random background from the prompt - plus - random event sample . for our experimental conditions and for the chosen tagger - hit window ,",
    "40% of all event candidates were selected for more than one tagger hit . since",

    "the simulation of the @xmath36 decay was made according to phase space .",
    "the small deviation of the actual @xmath36 decays from phase space was not significant in our analysis .",
    "all mc events were propagated through a geant ( version 3.21 ) simulation of the cb - taps detector , folded with resolutions of the detectors and conditions of the trigger .",

    "the number of the distributions shown is enough to illustrate the quality of our data , the main features of the @xmath0 dynamics at the measured energy range , and the impact of the present data on pwas .",
    "the most noticeable effect of the present data on the new ge09 and regge - maid is due to very good measurements of the forward - angle cross sections for w in the range between 1545 and 1675  mev .",
    "earlier , this forward region either had been measured with worse accuracy or could only be reached by extrapolation .    for completeness , in fig .",

    "[ fig : g2 ] and [ fig : g2a ] , the @xmath81 total cross section rises sharply above the reaction threshold .",
    "such behavior is usually attributed to the dominance of the @xmath8 resonance , having a mass close to the @xmath2 production threshold ( @xmath113  mev ) and a strong coupling to the @xmath9 channel . generally , the cross section for any process with a two - particle final state has the form [ ( p*/w )  f(w ) ] .",
    "the first factor comes from the phase - space integration , and @xmath114 is the final - state relative momentum in the c.m .",
    "frame . the second factor f(w )",
    "is determined by amplitudes .",
    "the essential point is that w and f(w ) depend explicitly only on @xmath115 , not on @xmath114 . in terms of the final - state parameters",
    ", @xmath116 depends on masses and @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the near - threshold structure of the cross section should look as a series in the odd powers of @xmath114 .",
    "our data for @xmath0 are well described up to @xmath117  mev / c as @xmath118 with @xmath119/(mev / c ) and @xmath120/(mev / c)@xmath121 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : g6 ] ) .",
    "contributions to the cubic term come both from p - wave amplitudes and from @xmath116-dependence of the s - wave amplitude , which is essential due to the near - theshold dominance of the s - wave resonance @xmath8 .",

    "fig : g6 ] ) .",
    "the good quality of our data reveals itself in very small fluctuations of experimental points with respect to the fit . for comparison",
    ", a similar threshold behavior has been also observed in @xmath27  @xcite , but the fluctuations there were larger due to lower precision of the data , and the coefficient @xmath124 could not be determined reliably .",
    "in addition , our fit gives implicit confirmation of small coupling of the @xmath9 channel with the @xmath125-wave resonance @xmath10 , which could generate an essential term @xmath126 .     as a function of the @xmath2 momentum in the c.m .",
    "the solid line shows the results of fitting our data to a sum of linear and cubic terms .",
    "[ fig : g6],scaledwidth=38.0% ]    due to the dominance of the low - energy @xmath127-wave multipole , this contribution is nearly model - independent up to @xmath128  mev .",

    "[ fig : g7],scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "the @xmath0 differential cross sections have been measured at the tagged photon facility of the mainz microtron mami - c using the crystal ball and taps spectrometers .",
    "the data span the photon - energy range 707  mev to 1402  mev and the full angular range in the c.m",
    "the accumulation of @xmath134 @xmath135 events allows the fine binning of the data in energy and angle , which will enable the reaction dynamics to be studied in greater detail than previously possible .",
    "the present data agree well with previous equivalent measurements , but are markedly superior in terms of precision and energy resolution .    the present cross sections for the free proton show no evidence of enhancement in the region @xmath136  mev , contrary to recent equivalent measurements on the quasi - free neutron  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not exclude the existence of an @xmath83 state as hypothesized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the region around @xmath5  mev",
    ", we rather observe a dip structure that becomes more pronounced at forward production angles of @xmath2 .",
    "this feature was missed or questionable in the analysis of the previous data .",
    "the interpretation of this dip depends on dynamics .",
    "our @xmath0 data points have been included in a new said ( ge09 ) and regge - maid pwas , to which they made an substantial contribution , particularly for forward angles .",
    "comparing to the previous said fit , e429 , and to the @xmath2-maid fit , the description of all existing data by the new solutions , ge09 and regge - maid , is more satisfactory in the entire energy range .",
    "we expect that the data presented in this paper will be invaluable for future partial - wave and coupled - channel analyses , in that they can provide much stronger constraints on the properties of the nucleon resonances from our energy region .",
