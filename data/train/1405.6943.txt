    "<S> in previous publications we have proposed that inflation can be realized in a second minimum of the standard model higgs potential at energy scales of about @xmath0 gev , if the minimum is not too deep and if a mechanism which allows a transition to the radiation dominated era can be found . </S>",
    "<S> this is provided , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , by scalar - tensor gravity models or hybrid models . using such ideas </S>",
    "<S> we had predicted the higgs boson mass to be of about @xmath1 gev , which has been confirmed by the lhc , and that a possibly measurable amount of gravity waves should be produced . using more refined recent theoretical calculations of the rge </S>",
    "<S> we show that such scenario has the right scale of inflation only for small higgs mass , lower than about 124 gev , otherwise gravity waves are overproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the precise value is subject to some theoretical error and to experimental errors on the determination of the strong coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> such an upper bound corresponds also to the recent claimed measurement by bicep2 of the scale of inflation through primordial tensor modes . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that introducing a moderately large non - minimal coupling for the higgs field the bound can shift to larger values and be reconciled with the lhc measurements of the higgs mass .    in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have proposed that inflation in the early universe can be realized for a narrow band of values of the top quark and higgs boson masses , for which the standard model ( sm ) higgs potential develops a second local minimum  @xcite at energy scales of about @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario is viable if a successful transition to a radiation - dominated era can be obtained , which we have shown to be possible in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using an explicit model in the framework of a scalar - tensor theory of gravity developed in  @xcite and in  @xcite using a hybrid inflationary model with an additional weakly coupled scalar , in standard gravity . </S>",
    "<S> such a generic scenario could be be realized only for a higgs mass @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 gev , the error being mainly due to the theoretical uncertainty of the 2-loops renormalization group equations ( rge ) used in that calculation . </S>",
    "<S> such a prediction for the higgs mass range has turned out to be surprisingly compatible with the measurement of a higgs mass of @xmath4 gev by the lhc  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known , inflation can generate quantum mechanically tensor ( gravity wave ) modes , usually parameterized through @xmath5 , the ratio of tensor - to - scalar perturbation spectra at large scales . in  @xcite we had predicted a relatively large amplitude for @xmath5 in our scenario , which is set by the overall height of the second minimum , which can be computed up to the precision of the rge calculations and of the experimental input for the standard model parameters : @xmath2 , the top mass @xmath6 and the strong coupling constant @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however the situation has recently changed , since more refined theoretical calculations of the standard model potential have been performed , therefore making more precise the correspondence between the input parameters and the scale of the second minimum . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the tensor modes have now been claimed to be measured by the bicep2 collaboration  @xcite with a large amplitude , which corresponds to a scale of about @xmath8 gev .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we update our results , using the results of  @xcite for the higgs effective potential , and show that if the theoretical errors are under control the scale of inflation is generically larger than @xmath8 gev and can be reconciled with experiments only if @xmath9 gev ( plus a theoretical error , at present estimated to be of order @xmath10 gev ) . of course such conclusion can be changed if extra ingredients are added to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results that can be obtained by introducing a non - minimal coupling of the higgs to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> of course less minimal modifications , such as a direct coupling of the higgs to an extra scalar , can also easily shift the scale of inflation . finally , provided the scale of inflation due to the higgs potential is low enough </S>",
    "<S> , we also reanalyze the specific model based on scalar tensor theories  @xcite , which realizes the exit to a radiation dominated era , showing that it could reproduce observations on @xmath5 and on the scalar spectral index @xmath11 .    as in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we consider the potential for the higgs field @xmath12 in the sm of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> for very large values of the higgs field such potential can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is some effective quartic coupling  @xcite which is very close , but not identical , to the quartic coupling @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> due to the running of couplings @xmath14 can become very small at high energies , while keeping always positive values ( stability regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such conditions the potential can have an additional minimum at very high field values . </S>",
    "<S> while this is at present disfavored by the current calculations and measurements in the sm it still not ruled out . in particular this </S>",
    "<S> can still happen if the top quark mass has a low value compared to the present best fit  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs field starts in the false minimum at @xmath16 and dominates the energy density of the universe , the friedmann equation leads to a stage of inflationary expansion h^2 h_i^2 , a(t)e^h_i t [ eq - m ] where @xmath17 is the scale factor , @xmath18 is the hubble rate and @xmath19 is the reduced planck mass ( @xmath20 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial model - dependent ingredient is a mechanism to achieve a graceful exit from inflation , that is a transition to a radiation - dominated era , in a nearly flat universe at a sufficiently high - temperature . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have proposed that the higgs field can tunnel to the other side of the potential barrier by nucleating bubbles  @xcite that can successfully collide and percolate , in the presence of a scalar tensor theory of gravity . alternatively in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we had proposed that a smooth transition may happen also in standard gravity , in the presence of an extra scalar field very weakly coupled to the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> the main point of both mechanism is that they do _ not _ affect appreciably the sm runnings of couplings , since in the first model there is only a gravitational coupling to the standard model , and in the second case the dimensionless coupling constant is extremely small , of order @xmath21 . for this reason precise connections with low energy parameters still hold even in the presence of such new fields . </S>",
    "<S> of course it is possible that such a new scalar can also interact with the higgs field with a large direct coupling and in this case this could also affect the rge equations and we briefly discuss later such possibilities .    subsequently the higgs field could roll down the potential , reheat the universe and finally relax in the present true vacuum with @xmath22 gev . in the scalar - tensor theory of gravity model an extra scalar field @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> is introduced , the brans - dicke scalar or dilaton , which has an interaction term of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ricci scalar and @xmath26 thus sets the value of the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such field makes the planck mass time - dependent , and therefore also @xmath27 during inflation : this slows down the expansion sufficiently enough if @xmath28 grows faster than @xmath29 for large @xmath23 values , since a stage of quasi exponential expansion is followed by a stage of power - law ( even decelerated ) expansion  @xcite . during the exponential phase the quantum fluctuations in @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> lead to a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations . during the subsequent decelerated phase , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 decreases rapidly , and therefore the expansion is sufficiently slowed down , so that many bubbles can be nucleated in a hubble patch and subsequently collide and reheat the universe , leading to a spatially flat radiation dominated universe .    as discussed in  @xcite , after tunneling we require the field @xmath23 to relax to zero if a suitable potential @xmath30 is present , which allows us to identify the present reduced planck mass with the quantity @xmath19 and , at the same time , to satisfy constraints from fifth - force experiments and time - dependence of the newton constant @xmath31  @xcite .    an alternative to scalar - tensor theories is given by models  @xcite with a direct tiny coupling of the higgs field to an additional scalar field , which induces a time - dependence directly into @xmath32 by flattening the barrier in the potential .    </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to notice that a graceful exit can be realized in the above models only if there is a very shallow false minimum , otherwise the tunneling rate would be negligibly small in the scalar - tensor model , since the probability is exponentially sensitive to the barrier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such shallowness is required also in the hybrid model since a change in the barrier by a large amount would introduce a departure from an almost flat scalar spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> so , the shape of the potential is very close to the case in which there is just an inflection point and thus we have a generic prediction for the scale of inflation and for @xmath5 , while the specific model only affects the prediction for the spectral index of cosmological density perturbations @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> using the recent state - of - the - art theoretical calculations given in  @xcite , we show the specific values of the top and higgs masses which allow for the presence of a false minimum . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations are now so accurate that also the precise value of @xmath34 inside the present allowed experimental range @xmath35  @xcite is a relevant parameter . as an example , in fig.[fig - vmin ] we also show the higgs potential for very specific values of @xmath6 and @xmath2 , showing agreement with fig.7 of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely precise values shown in the caption are not to be taken sharply , because of a theoretical uncertainty , estimated to be of about @xmath10 gev on @xmath2 and about @xmath36 gev on @xmath6 .     in units of @xmath37 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we fixed @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper curve correspond to @xmath39 , which shows good agreement with the results of  @xcite , fig .  7 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower curve corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and a value of @xmath42 . as mentioned in the text and discussed in  @xcite , in order to have a sizable tunneling probability through the left side , the barrier must be very low , almost as in an inflection point.,width=321 ]    .2 cm    increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath6 , one has also to increase ( decrease ) @xmath2 in order to develop the shallow false minimum ; accordingly , the value of both @xmath43 and @xmath16 increase ( decrease ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid blue lines in fig.[fig - mtmh ] show the points in the @xmath44 plane where the shallow sm false minima exists , for different values of @xmath45 in the 3-sigma range . </S>",
    "<S> the red dashed lines show the regions in ( @xmath46 ) which corresponds to a value of @xmath5 compatible with observations , directly given by the height of the potential via the equation @xmath47 and it turns out that these lines point to a too small value of @xmath2 compared to the present experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> of course this is a valid conclusion under the assumption that the theoretical errors on @xmath2 are now estimated to be of about @xmath10 gev by  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario could still be compatible with data only if the theoretical errors in the rge and the matching conditions were larger , say of about @xmath48 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> discarding such possibility we show that this could be cured by introducing a non - minimal coupling @xmath49 also for the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> this transforms the potential in the slow roll phase in the einstein frame in the following form ( see  @xcite and citations therein ) : @xmath50 which suppresses the potential at large field values and we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plotxi ] that a moderately large value of @xmath51 allows for the potential to fit cmb observations , also for larger @xmath2 , compatible with the lhc measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however let us comment that this is based only on a tree level analysis and when having a value of the extra coupling constant @xmath51 larger than @xmath52 we have to be careful about the regime of validity of the theory , similarly to the models proposed in  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> .22 cm         .22 cm    finally we also show the results for the @xmath53 plot for the scalar tensor model proposed in  @xcite in figure  [ nsr ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a model is based on the introduction of an additional non - minimally coupled field @xmath23 with the following action : @xmath54    \\label{azione}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the standard model lagrangian and the potential @xmath56 is not specified and assumed to be relevant only after inflation to stabilize the field . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling function is given by : @xmath57 with the requirement that @xmath58 , which is guaranteed for instance if the couplings @xmath59 are positive . </S>",
    "<S> under these conditions @xmath60 starts almost constant and after a sufficient umber of efolds starts decreasing as a power law , allowing for a tunneling transition when @xmath61 becomes equal to the tunneling rate per unit volume @xmath32 . as a simple example we will study the case in which @xmath62 and all other couplings are vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs fields is at the minimum and it is not evolving during inflation the only time dependent quantity is @xmath23 and so we can go the einstein frame with a metric defined by @xmath63 and study the evolution of a canonically normalized field @xmath64 defined through @xmath65 , where @xmath66 in this frame the action becomes : s_e= 12d^4x  [ m^2 |r-(|)^2- 2 |l_sm ] [ e - action-2 ] . where the bar represents quantities in the einstein frame . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs potential contained in @xmath67 is now @xmath68 , so that the potential energy at the false higgs minimum @xmath16 gives rise to a potential term for @xmath64 s_e^_0=d^4x   |v , |v . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - vb0 ] this acts as a hill - top potential for the @xmath64 field and we assume that @xmath64 rolls down the potential from small to high values . given the potential we define as usual the slow - roll parameters ( n ) = |    @xmath64 under such a potential assuming that it starts as close to zero as possible ( _ i.e. _ with an initial value @xmath69 given by the quantum fluctuations @xmath70 ) together with the friedmann equation , which gives us a numerical solution for @xmath71 , where n is the number of efolds at some value of the scale factor @xmath72 , defined as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the scale factor at the end of the inflationary stage , defined by either @xmath75 or @xmath76 becoming of order 1 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we evaluate the quantites @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the number of efolds that corresponds to a certain cosmological scale . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath79 although the precise number depends on the history of the evolution subsequent to inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig.[nsr ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the slow - roll parameters , which does not hold for very small @xmath80 , therefore leading to incorrect results for @xmath81 , which corresponds to a sizable @xmath5 in fig.[nsr ] . ]    in conclusion we have shown that a mechanism in which the energy density for inflation is provided by the higgs field starting in a shallow false minimum can be compatible with observations only if @xmath9 gev ( and also @xmath6 has to be smaller than about @xmath82 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is significantly lower than experimental observations unless the theoretical error on the rge , of about @xmath10 gev on @xmath2 according to  @xcite , is largely underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that introducing a non - minimal coupling of the higgs of about @xmath83 can push this upper bound on larger values , closer to present observations . </S>",
    "<S> of course such bounds can be also evaded by modifying the shape of the potential in a model - dependent way . </S>",
    "<S> for instance a possibility would be to introduce direct couplings of the higgs with the extra scalar as in  @xcite , which would change the potential either at tree level or in the rge , or perhaps to allow a faster change of the barrier in hybrid models during inflation .     and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 for the scalar - tensor model of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here the number of efolds is assumed to be @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> only one nonvanishing parameter @xmath80 was assumed to be present in eq .  </S>",
