    "the discovery of radioactivity in the nineteenth century initialized the study of the process of decay of radioactive elements .",
    "experiments have shown that the radioactive decay of the sample of radioactive elements is a process extended in time , and that with the passage of time the number of elements in the sample , which emits radioactive radiation , decreases .",
    "these observations and assumption that the decay rate follows the laws of probability led rutherford and sody to the formulation of radioactive decay law as a function of time @xcite .",
    "this radioactive decay law allows to determine the number @xmath0 of atoms of the radioactive element at the instant @xmath1 knowing the initial number @xmath2 of them at initial instant of time @xmath3 and has the exponential form : @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "since then , the belief that the decay law has the exponential form has become common .",
    "the rise of quantum mechanics led to an understanding that the radioactive decay similarly to the process of emission of photons by excited atoms are time dependent quantum processes .",
    "so the question arose how to describe such processes within the quantum theory .",
    "probably the most known attempt to solve this problem is the weisskopf  wigner theory of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "considering the excited atomic levels and applying the shrdinger equation to describe the time evolution weisskopf and wigner found that to a good approximation the non  decay probability of the excited levels is a decreasing function of time having exponential form .",
    "further studies of the quantum decay processes showed that basic principles of the quantum theory does not allow them to be described by an exponential decay law at very late times @xcite and at initial stage of the decay process ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that at late times the survival probability ( i. e. the decay law ) should tends to zero as @xmath6 much more slowly than any exponential function of time and that as a function of time it has the inverse power  like form at this regime of time @xcite .",
    "there was many unsuccessful attempts to verify experimentally predicted deviations from the exponential form of the decay law at late times regime ( see eg .",
    "the first experimental evidence of deviations of the decay law from exponential form at such a time regime was reported in @xcite .",
    "the early times properties of the decay process lead to the so called quantum zeno effect @xcite , that is to slowing down sufficiently frequently observed decay process up to stop it down in the case of the continuously observed the unstable system .",
    "the experimental confirmation of this effect was reported , e.g. in @xcite and recently in @xcite .",
    "all these results of theoretical and experimental researches caused that there are rather widespread belief that a universal feature of the quantum decay process is the presence of three time regimes of such a decay process : the early time ( initial ) , exponential ( or `` canonical '' ) , and late time having inverse  power law form @xcite .",
    "this belief is reinforced by a numerous presentations in the literature of decay curves obtained for quantum models of unstable systems .",
    "the typical form of such a decay curve one can find in fig .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) . in this context , each experimental evidence of oscillating decay curve at times of the order of life time is considered as an anomaly caused by a new quantum effects or new interactions ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . the question arises , if indeed in the case of one component quantum unstable systems these oscillations of the decay process at the `` exponential '' regime are an anomaly , or perhaps universal feature of quantum decay processes . here",
    "we give the proof that there is no time interval in which the survival probability ( decay law ) could be a decreasing function of time of the purely exponential form .",
    "we also show that even in the case of a single component unstable system the decay curve has an oscillatory form with a smaller or a large amplitude of oscillations depending on the model considered .",
    "the main information about properties of quantum unstable systems is contained in their decay law , that is in their survival probability .",
    "let the reference frame @xmath7 be the common inertial rest frame for the observer and for the unstable system .",
    "then if one knows that the system in the rest frame is in the initial unstable state @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 is the hilbert space of states of the considered system ) , which was prepared at the initial instant @xmath3 , then one can calculate its survival probability ( the decay law ) , @xmath10 , of the unstable state @xmath11 decaying in vacuum , which equals @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability amplitude of finding the system at the time @xmath1 in the initial unstable state @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the solution of the schrdinger equation for the initial condition @xmath16 : @xmath17 here @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the total self  adjoint hamiltonian for the system considered .",
    "note that if @xmath11 represents an unstable state then it can not be an eigenvector for @xmath19 : in such a case the eigenvalue equation @xmath20 has no solutions for @xmath21 under considerations .",
    "there is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is unitary evolution operator and @xmath24 is the unit operator .",
    "thus @xmath25 . the one  parameter family of unitary operators @xmath23",
    "forms group : @xmath26 .",
    "the the total hamiltonian @xmath19 of the system is a generator of this group .",
    "this means that operators @xmath19 and @xmath23 have common eigenfunctions .    from the results of theoretical studies of the problem which one can find in the literature",
    "it is known that the amplitude @xmath13 , and thus the decay law @xmath10 of the unstable state @xmath11 , are completely determined by the density of the energy distribution @xmath27 for the system in this state @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ( see also : @xcite ) . from this relation and from the riemann ",
    "lebesgue lemma it follows that @xmath31 as @xmath6 .",
    "it is because from the normalization condition @xmath30 it follows that @xmath32 is an absolutely integrable function .",
    "these properties are the essence of the so - called fock  krylov theory of unstable states",
    "( note that this approach is also applicable in quantum field theory models @xcite ) .",
    "khalfin in @xcite assuming that the spectrum of @xmath19 must be bounded from below , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that is that @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and using the paley ",
    "wiener theorem @xcite proved that in the case of unstable states there must be @xmath37 $ ] , for @xmath38 . here @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore the decay law @xmath41 of unstable states decaying in the vacuum , ( [ p(t ) ] ) , can not be described by an exponential function of time @xmath1 if time @xmath1 is suitably long , @xmath42 , and that for these lengths of time @xmath43 tends to zero as @xmath44 more slowly than any exponential function of @xmath1 .",
    "as it was mentioned , this effect was confirmed in experiment described in the rothe paper @xcite .",
    "in general the spectral density @xmath27 has properties similar to the scattering amplitude , i.e. , it can be decomposed into a threshold factor , a pole - function @xmath45 with a simple pole ( often modeled by a breit - wigner ) and a smooth from factor @xmath46 .",
    "so , we can write @xmath47 , where @xmath48 depends on the angular momentum @xmath49 through @xmath50 , @xcite ( see equation ( 6.1 ) in @xcite ) , @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 is a step function : @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the simplest choice is to take @xmath55 and to assume that @xmath45 has a breit  wigner form .",
    "it turns out that the decay curves obtained in this simplest case are very similar in form to the curves calculated for the above described more general @xmath32 , ( see @xcite and analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "so to find the most typical properties of the decay curve it is sufficient to make the relevant calculations for @xmath32 modeled by the the breit  wigner distribution of the energy density",
    ".    the typical form of the survival probability @xmath10 obtained in such a way is presented in fig ( [ f1 ] ) .",

    "the first case means that @xmath118 if and only if the vector @xmath21 representing an unstable state of the system is an eigenvector for the unitary evolution operator @xmath23 . as we noted earlier the evolution operator @xmath23 and the total hamiltonian @xmath19 of the system have common eigenvectors .",

    "so taking into account the definition of @xmath86 the following conclusion follows : within the approach considered in this paper for any time interval @xmath77 $ ] the decay law can not be described by the exponential function of time .",
    "this conclusion is the general one .",
    "it does not depend on models of quantum unstable states and confirms the similar conclusion drawn earlier for the breit  wigner model .",
    "summing up the oscillating decay curves of one component unstable system can not be considered as something extraordinary or as anomaly : it seems to be a universal feature of the decay process .",
    "oscillatory modulated decay curves are usually observed in two or more component unstable systems .",
    "a typical example of such systems is a neutral meson complex . from the results presented above it follows that such an effect can be also observed in one component quantum unstable systems at the `` exponential '' decay regimes of times .",
    "what is more the oscillatory modulation of decay curves at the `` exponential '' decays regime takes place even in the quantum unstable system modeled by the breit  wigner distribution of the energy density . in general , the oscillatory modulation of the survival probability at the `` exponential '' decay regime and thus the decay curves with model depending amplitude and oscillations period takes place even in the case of one component unstable systems modeled by any physically acceptable form of @xmath32 . from results of the model calculations presented in figs ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) it follows that at the initial stage of the `` exponential '' ( or `` canonical '' ) decay regime the amplitude of these oscillations may be much less than the accuracy of detectors",
    ". then with increasing time the amplitude of oscillations grows ( see fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) ) , which increases the chances of observing them .",
