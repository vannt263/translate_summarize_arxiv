    "singular ( or contact or zero - range ) interaction potentials were introduced in quantum mechanics more than sixty years ago @xcite .",
    "since that time the attitude of physicists and mathematicians to this subject was varying , starting from `` it is impossible '' , then to `` it is evident '' , and finally arriving at `` it is interesting '' ( for a review see monograph @xcite ) .",
    "a mathematically consistent and rigorous treatment of the subject was developed @xcite , basing on the notion of self - adjoint extension of a hermitian ( symmetric ) operator .",
    "singular interaction is involved in quantum field theory when , for example , a spinor field is quantized in the background of a pointlike magnetic monopole in threedimensional space or a pointlike magnetic vortex in twodimensional space . in these cases",
    "the dirac hamiltonian , in contrast to the schrodinger one , is free from an explicit @xmath0-function singularity ; nonetheless the problem of self - adjoint extension of both dirac and schrodinger operators arises , albeit for different reasons ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "a distinguishing feature is that a solution to the dirac equation , unlike that to the schrodinger one , can not obey a condition of regularity at the singularity point .",
    "it is necessary then to define a boundary condition at this point , and the least restrictive , but still physically acceptable , condition is such that guarantees self - adjointness of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "thus , effects of polarization of the fermionic vacuum in a singular background ( such as a pointlike monopole or a pointlike vortex ) appear to depend on the choice of the boundary condition at the singularity point , and a set of permissible boundary conditions is labelled , most generally , by the values of self - adjoint extension parameters .",
    "in contrast to the schrodinger case , the extension in the dirac case does not reflect additional types of interaction but represents complementary information that must be specified when describing the physical attributes of the already posited singular background configuration .    as a consequence ,",
    "the fermionic vacuum under the influence of a singular background can acquire rather unusual properties : leakage of quantum numbers from the singularity point occurs . while in the case of a monopole there is leakage of charge to the vacuum , which results in the monopole becoming the dyon violating the dirac quantization condition and cp symmetry @xcite , in the case of a vortex ( the ehrenberg - siday - aharonov - bohm potential @xcite ) the situation is much more complicated , since there is leakage of both charge and other quantum numbers to the vacuum .",
    "apparently , this is due to a nontrivial topology of the base space in the latter case : @xmath1 in the case of a space with a deleted point , and @xmath2 in the case of a space with a deleted line ( or a plane with a deleted point ) ; here @xmath3 is the first homotopy group and @xmath4 is a set of integer numbers . for a particular choice of the boundary condition at the location of a singular vortex it has been shown that charge @xcite , current @xcite and angular momentum @xcite are induced in the vacuum .",
    "the induced vacuum quantum numbers under general boundary conditions which are compatible with self - adjointness have been considered in refs.@xcite .    a pointlike static magnetic vortex ( the ehrenberg - siday - aharonov - bohm configuration ) in @xmath5 dimensional space - time has the form @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vortex flux in @xmath9 units , i.e. in the london ( @xmath10 ) units , since we use conventional units @xmath11 and coupling constant @xmath12 is included into vector potential @xmath13 .",
    "the wave function on the plane ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) with punctured singular point @xmath16 obeys the most general condition ( see @xcite for more details ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the polar coordinates , and @xmath20 is a continuous real parameter which is varied in the range @xmath21",
    ". it can be shown ( see , for example , @xcite ) that @xmath20 as well as @xmath8 is changed under singular gauge transformations , whereas difference @xmath22 remains invariant .",
    "thus , physically sensible quantities are to depend on the gauge invariant combination @xmath22 which will be for brevity denoted as the reduced vortex flux in the following .    thus far",
    "the effects of polarization of the massive fermionic vacuum have been studied . in the present paper",
    "we find the energy density which is induced by a singular vortex in the massless fermionic vacuum . in the next section ,",
    "the most general set of physically acceptable boundary conditions at the singularity point @xmath23 is defined . in section iii",
    "we show how the problem of both ultraviolet and infrared divergences in vacuum characteristics is solved with the help of zeta function regularization .",
    "this allows us to get immediately in section iv the vacuum energy density ; also here the effective action and the effective potential are considered .",
    "we summarize results and discuss their consequences in section v. the method of self - adjoint extension is employed to get the boundary condition at the singularity point in appendix .",

    "then its adjoint @xmath193 which is defined by the relation ^_0 drr[^(r)]^^0(r ) = ^_0 drr[(r)]^acts on the domain of functions @xmath194 that are not necessarily regular at @xmath192 .",
    "so the question is , whether the domain of definition of @xmath190 can be extended , resulting in both the operator and its adjoint being defined on the same domain of functions ? to answer this , one has to construct the eigenspaces of @xmath195 with complex eigenvalues .",
    "they are spanned by the linearly independent square - integrable solutions correspoding to the pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues , ^^(r ) = i^(r ) , where @xmath70 is inserted for the dimension reasons .",
    "it can be shown that in the case of eq.(a.1 ) only one pair of such solutions exists , thus the deficiency index of @xmath190 is equal to ( 1,1 ) .",
    "this pair is given by the following expression ^(r ) = 1n (      ) , where @xmath152 is a certain normalization factor and = , = arctan(|m| ) .",
    "self - adjoint extended operator @xmath196 is defined on the domain of functions of the form ( _ n_0 + _",
    "n_0 + ) = ^0 + c(^+ + e^i_s^- ) , where @xmath197 is a complex parameter and @xmath198 is a real continuous parameter which depends , in general , on the choice between the two inequivalent representations of the clifford algebra . using the asymptotics of the macdonald function at small values of the variable , we get (            certainly , both @xmath198 and @xmath68 can be regarded as self - adjoint extension parameters which are to specify the boundary condition at @xmath192 . the use of @xmath68 in this aspect may seem to be more preferable just for the convenience reasons , because eq.(2.14 ) looks much simpler than eq.(a.8 ) .",
    "in particular , eq.(2.14 ) , in contrast to eq.(a.8 ) , is independent of @xmath86 and remains explicitly invariant under @xmath199 ( @xmath68 is independent of @xmath200 ) .      concluding this appendix ,",
    "let us note that all characteristics of the massless fermionic vacuum are depending on @xmath177 ( 3.19 ) rather than on @xmath68 itself , and @xmath177 is expressed through @xmath202 in the following way a=- .",
