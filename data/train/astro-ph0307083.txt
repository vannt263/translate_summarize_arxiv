    "massive stars in close binaries are destined to interact in some way over their lifetimes .",
    "the initially more massive star is the first to evolve , and after shedding its outer , h - rich envelope by stellar winds , it may begin mass transfer of cno nuclear processed gas to its companion @xcite .",
    "after completion of the mass transfer stage , the abundance ratio of n / c in the photosphere of the gainer may have increased from the solar value of 0.3 to an enriched value of 3 @xcite , or even higher if the mass accretion had induced large scale mixing in the mass gainer @xcite . however , there is conflicting evidence about whether or not mass transfer actually occurs in real binaries composed of massive , o - type stars @xcite .",
    "the massive x - ray binaries ( mxrbs ) , for example , generally do not exhibit evidence of n - enrichment , and this fact suggests that the supernova ( sn ) progenitor may eject mass from the entire system , perhaps during a luminous blue variable stage @xcite .    we were surprised , therefore , to discover that the @xmath14 lines in the spectrum of the mxrb and microquasar ls  5039 ( type o6.5  v((f ) ) ; @xcite ) displayed a weakness indicative of cno processed gas @xcite .",
    "ls  5039 is also unusual in several other respects .",
    "it is one of only a few confirmed mxrbs with associated radio emission @xcite .",
    "it has radio - emitting relativistic jets characteristic of galactic microquasars , and it is probably a high energy gamma ray source as well @xcite .",
    "we found that the system is a short period binary with the highest known eccentricity ( @xmath15 ) among o star binaries with comparable periods @xcite .",
    "this high eccentricity probably resulted from the huge mass loss that occurred with the sn explosion that gave birth to the compact star in the system @xcite .",
    "binaries that suffer large mass loss in a sn are expected to become runaway stars , and recently both we @xcite and @xcite found that ls  5039 has a significant proper motion indicating a large peculiar space velocity .    here we present results from new optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy that confirm the presence of cno processed gas in the photosphere of ls  5039 .",
    "we give revised orbital elements for the binary (  2 ) , and we use our combined optical spectra to assign ls  5039 to the category of the n - rich on stars (  3 ) .",
    "we present the first uv spectra of ls  5039 ( made with hst / stis ) that we analyze to determine the stellar wind properties (  4 ) and interstellar reddening (  5 ) .",
    "we use the new results to revisit the issue of the masses of the o - star and compact companion (  6 ) .",
    "we also present simple models for the change in orbital elements caused by the supernova (  7 ) , which require a modest kick velocity in order to reproduce the observed eccentricity and runaway velocity .",
    "finally we discuss the possible explanations for the n - enrichment given our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the system (  8) .",
    "we obtained new spectra of ls  5039 on four different observing runs , and the details about the spectrograph setup in each case are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the primary set of blue region spectra come from observations with the university of texas mcdonald observatory 2.7  m telescope and large cassegrain spectrograph ( lcs ) on two observing runs ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "all these were made with a ti ccd ( @xmath16 , 15.2 @xmath17 m pixels ) except on one night when we used a loral / fairchild ccd ( @xmath18 , 12 @xmath17 m pixels ) .",
    "most of the spectra were made in a single 1200  s exposure that resulted in a signal - to - noise ratio of s / n = 120 in the continuum .",
    "a secondary set of blue spectra were made with the ctio 1.5  m telescope and cassegrain spectrograph ( cs ) using a loral ccd ( @xmath18 , 15 @xmath17 m pixels ) .",
    "these were usually 1800  s exposures that produced a s / n = 80 in the continuum .",
    "we also observed the red spectral region during a kpno coude feed run in 2002 june .",
    "these spectra are comparable to those we presented in @xcite except that these new spectra were obtained with a ti ccd that had smaller wavelength coverage .",
    "finally , we obtained one additional red spectrum of lower resolving power with the ctio 1.5  m cs on 2003 march 21 .",
    "all these spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard techniques in iraf .",
    "we removed atmospheric telluric lines from the red spectra using spectra of broad - lined a - type stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our first task was to re - evaluate the orbital elements presented in @xcite using an enlarged set of radial velocity measurements .",
    "we measured radial velocities for the blue spectra by cross - correlating each spectrum with the average of the blue spectra made at mcdonald observatory ( the largest homogeneous set ) .",
    "we omitted spectral regions containing interstellar features .",
    "these relative velocities were converted to an absolute scale by adding the radial velocity of the average spectrum as determined by parabolic fitting of the cores of the strong lines , @xmath19 km  s@xmath3 ( using rest wavelengths from @xcite ) .",
    "radial velocities from the red spectra were also determined by cross - correlation techniques , but in this case the reference spectrum was formed by a shift - and - add average of the red spectra obtained earlier @xcite .",
    "this cross - correlation function is generally based on the positions of the h@xmath10 and @xmath20 features , but for the ctio red spectrum we also included the spectral regions containing @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also determined the cross - correlation positions of the sharp interstellar line at 6614   that we used to make small velocity corrections between observatories .",
    "the 14 new radial velocity measurements are collected in table  2 .    our first attempt to revise the orbital period and other elements starting with the period we found earlier ( @xmath23 d ; @xcite ) failed , with 8 of the 14 new measurements falling far from the calculated radial velocity curve .",
    "thus , we made a new period search using the discrete fourier transform method of @xcite .",
    "there are a number of candidate peaks in the periodogram that are clustered around a frequency of 0.25 cycles  d@xmath3 , and most of these are aliases introduced by our sparse data sampling @xcite .",
    "we tested each of these candidate periods using the nonlinear , least - squares fitting program of @xcite to determine the orbital elements , and only one of the test periods , @xmath4  d , led to consistent placement of all the new measurements .",
    "this value was also the primary signal found using the phase dispersion minimization technique of @xcite that is useful for finding periodicities in non - sinusoidal variations .",
    "significantly , this period also fits new radial velocity data obtained by j.  casares , m.  rib , j.  m.  paredes , and j.  mart ( in preparation ) .",
    "the revised orbital elements are given in table  3 , and the observations and radial velocity curve are shown in figure  1 .",
    "this fit assumed equal weights for each radial velocity measurement ; fits weighted using the inverse square of the standard deviation of each measurement led to identical results within errors .",
    "aside from the orbital period , the new elements do not differ greatly from those we presented earlier @xcite .",
    "most of our observations are clustered into runs of a week or so ( comparable to the period ) so that while the placement of these groups of measurements in phase is somewhat altered , the overall shape of the curve is much the same .",
    "@xcite discuss the appearance of the optical and near - ir spectrum of ls  5039 , from which they derive a spectral classification of o6.5  v((f ) ) for the mass donor star .",
    "here we examine the line patterns in our optical spectra to confirm this classification .",
    "we formed an average blue spectrum by calculating a shift - and - add mean spectrum from our mcdonald and best ctio spectra ( based upon the line shifts from the orbital solution in the last section ) .",
    "the average interstellar spectrum was divided out of each observed spectrum prior to forming the average .",
    "the resulting mean spectrum is shown in the upper plot in figure  2 together with identifications for the more prominent lines .",
    "we also show in this diagram the blue spectra of the standard stars hd  93146 ( o6.5  v((f ) ) ; from the atlas of @xcite ) and 15  mon ( o7  v((f ) ) ; obtained during our ctio run ) . @xcite",
    "have recently made available a library of synthetic stellar spectra for a grid of non - lte atmospheres appropriate for o - type stars , and we show in figure  2 a flux rectified version of one of their models ( with stellar parameters discussed below ) .",
    "this spectrum was convolved with broadening functions to simulate stellar rotational and spectrographic instrumental broadening ( discussed below ) .",
    "the spectral subtype among o - type stars is defined by the relative strengths of the and lines @xcite .",
    "the relative strengths of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 lines in the spectrum of ls  5039 make a good match with the o6.5  v((f ) ) standard star ( but not with the cooler o7",
    "v((f ) ) spectrum in which @xmath25 is stronger ) .",
    "the primary luminosity criterion at this spectral type is the strength of the @xmath26 line that ranges from strong absorption to strong emission between main sequence and luminous supergiant stars ( see fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "the deep @xmath26 absorption line in the spectrum of ls  5039 clearly indicates a luminosity class v object .",
    "we also observe weak emission in the @xmath27 blend , which is indicated by the classification suffix ( ( f ) ) .",
    "our results therefore confirm the spectral classification obtained by @xcite of o6.5  v((f ) ) .",
    "we note , however , the unusual strength of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 features in the spectrum of ls  5039 compared to the other reference spectra .",
    "these lines tend to peak near type o8.5 , and at any given subtype they increase in strength with luminosity @xcite .",
    "the equivalent width of the @xmath29 blend in the spectrum of ls  5039 is @xmath30 , which is larger than that in all 13 n - strong stars with spectral types o7 or earlier listed by @xcite ( with the exception of the n enhanced , o7",
    "v((f ) ) star , hd  90273 ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the @xmath31 blend is weak or absent in the spectrum of ls  5039 , and other c features are also unusually weak ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 emission , @xmath34 ) . we show below that this trend of strong n and weak c is also found in the uv stellar wind lines (  5 ) .",
    "these characteristics are the hallmark of the on type stars that appear to be contaminated with cno nuclear processed gas @xcite .",
    "one of the hottest stars that is currently assigned to the on group is hd  110360 ( on7  v ; @xcite ) , and the strong similarity in appearance between ls  5039 and hd  110360 ( see fig .  5 in @xcite ) suggests that ls  5039 also belongs to this group .",
    "thus , we advocate a classification of on6.5  v((f ) ) for the spectrum of ls  5039 .    the appearance of the optical line spectrum can also be used to help estimate the physical properties of the star using the new non - lte model spectra from @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of their grid of model spectra with our observed spectrum can provide reliable estimates of the stellar projected rotational velocity @xmath35 , the effective temperature @xmath36 , and the gravitational acceleration @xmath37 .",
    "we adopted the @xcite solar metallicity models , which assume an atmospheric microturbulent velocity of 10 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we used our relatively higher dispersion red spectra ( @xmath38 ; @xcite ) to find a value of @xmath35 that would produce a match of the model and observed profiles of the strong @xmath21 line .",
    "we formed a rotational broadening function for a linear limb darkening law @xcite using a limb darkening coefficient from the tables of @xcite , and then the @xcite model spectrum was convolved with this and a gaussian instrumental broadening function for direct comparison with the observed profile .",
    "the best fit was made with @xmath7 km  s@xmath3 , which is in good agreement with our earlier result of @xmath39 km  s@xmath3 based upon the half - width of the @xmath40 line @xcite .",
    "we estimated the effective temperature by comparing the observed to line ratios with those predicted from the grid of model spectra from @xcite .",
    "we measured equivalent widths of the major he lines by gaussian fitting of the observed spectral profiles , and we then formed logarithms of the important ratios used in spectral classification ( table  4 ) .",
    "we made numerical integrations across the same lines in the grid of model spectra by @xcite and then formed plots of @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 $ ] versus @xmath36 .",
    "we restricted the grid to models with @xmath44 , which is the appropriate gravity for main sequence stars ( see below ) .",
    "table  4 lists the resulting values of @xmath36 made by interpolation with the observed ratios in these curves .",
    "we formed a final mean temperature by double weighting the result from the primary ratio that defines the classification sequence , @xmath24 to @xmath25 , to arrive at @xmath45  kk .",
    "this temperature is somewhat low for spectral type ",
    "temperature calibrations based upon pure h and he model atmospheres @xcite but it agrees well with more recent calibrations that rely on blanketed , non - lte models @xcite .    the stellar gravity , @xmath37 , is presumably the key parameter defining the appearance of the @xmath26 line for stars of this temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the emergence of this feature as an emission line in more luminous stars is the result of their vigorous stellar winds , and unfortunately the @xcite models are based on static , plane parallel atmospheres that will not predict the @xmath26 line strength correctly in most cases .",
    "instead , we can use the stark broadening of the h balmer lines to help estimate the atmospheric pressure and hence gravity .",
    "h@xmath46 is the most suitable feature in our spectra for this purpose since h@xmath47 is severely blended with @xmath48 at this spectral resolution .",
    "we show in figure  3 the observed and model h@xmath46 profiles for @xmath49 , 4.0 , and 4.3 ( cgs units ) .",
    "these model profiles were convolved with both the rotational and instrumental broadening functions .",
    "the comparison indicates that @xmath50 .",
    "however , we caution that this value may be biased upwards by the presence of lines in the wings of h@xmath46 ( wavelengths from the nist database ) that are probably underestimated by the @xcite models in this particular case .",
    "a reliable abundance analysis is clearly desirable , but will require higher dispersion spectra to account for the effects of line blending in the vicinity of the key cno lines .",
    "however , we made preliminary estimates by calculating line profiles for a range of assumed abundances using the radiative transfer code _",
    "synspec _ and the non - lte stellar atmosphere associated with our derived values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we found that the equivalent width of the @xmath51 blend ( @xmath30  ) corresponds to a n abundance of @xmath52 dex relative to the solar value .",
    "the equivalent width of @xmath32 ( @xmath53  ) yields a c abundance of @xmath54 dex ( i.e. , sub - solar ) .",
    "these trends are consistent with our expectations for cno processed gas @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra of o - type stars are a key source of information about their photospheres and stellar winds @xcite , and we were fortunate to obtain the first ever uv spectra of ls  5039 with the _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in 2002 august . during the first visit to the target ( 2002 aug 13 ) we obtained two exposures ( exposure times of 2087 and 1814 s ) with the g140l grating and one exposure ( 600 s ) with the g230l grating .",
    "the g140l grating covers the wavelength range 1150  1730   with a resolving power of @xmath55 while the g230l grating records the range 1570  3180   with a resolving power of @xmath56 .",
    "a second visit was made 7 days later ( 2002 aug 20 ) to obtain a single exposure ( 2087 s ) with the g140l grating .",
    "these visits correspond to orbital phases 0.145 and 0.708 , respectively , when the o - star primary was oriented at an angle from the line of the nodes in the orbital plane of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively (  2 ) .",
    "thus , the first visit occurred just past the quadrature phase when the orbital axis was orthogonal to our line of sight and the second visit was made shortly after primary superior conjunction ( compact companion in the foreground ) .",
    "there were no obvious flux or profile variations between these visits , so we formed an exposure weighted average fuv spectrum for examination .",
    "we obtained a single uv spectrum from the archives of the _ international ultraviolet explorer satellite _ of the same o6.5  v((f ) ) reference standard shown above in figure  2 , hd  93146 , to compare to that of ls  5039 .",
    "we rebinned the high dispersion _ iue _ spectrum ( swp  11136 ) of hd  93146 onto the wavelength grid of the stis fuv spectrum , and both the reference and target spectra were rectified to a pseudo - continuum by division of a polynomial fit made through relatively line - free regions .",
    "two sections of these spectra in the immediate vicinity of the strong stellar wind lines @xmath0 and @xmath1 are illustrated in figures 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "there is generally good agreement between the spectra of ls  5039 and hd  93146 in the uv photospheric lines .",
    "there are differences , however , in the interstellar line strengths and especially in the wind lines .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 p  cygni profile has both a deeper blue absorption component ( due to stellar wind material projected against the disk of the star ) and a stronger red emission component ( from scattered light surrounding the star ) than is seen in the spectrum of hd  93146 .",
    "the differences occur in the opposite sense in the @xmath1 wind profile .",
    "the enhanced n and weak c features mirror the results found in the optical spectra , and these same wind line differences are found in other on type stars @xcite .",
    "both wind profiles have shapes that are similar to their counterparts in the spectrum of hd  93146 , and in particular , there are two minima in the absorption part of the @xmath0 feature in the spectra of both stars .",
    "these minima appear much narrower in the high dispersion version of the hd  93146 spectrum , and their spacing corresponds to the highly blueshifted positions of the doublet .",
    "they are examples of narrow ( or discrete ) absorption components ( nac ) that often appear in the uv wind lines @xcite .",
    "detailed time sequences demonstrate that nac usually proceed blueward through the trough and become narrower .",
    "@xcite show that the sum @xmath59 is approximately constant and equal to the extreme velocity found in saturated line cores , and they argue that this quantity is a good estimate of the wind terminal velocity , @xmath60 .",
    "we measured the doppler shifts of both minima in the @xmath0 profile of ls  5039 , and we find @xmath61 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the resolving power of the stis spectra is too low to determine the nac width , so we assumed it is the same as @xcite found for hd  93146 , @xmath62 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , we estimate that the wind terminal velocity for ls  5039 is @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 , which agrees well with the mean for the o6.5  v subtype of @xmath63 km  s@xmath3 @xcite .    in some mxrbs",
    "these wind lines display orbital phase variations due to excess ionization of the wind in a zone surrounding the x - ray source ( the _ hatchett - mccray effect _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wind profiles of ls  5039 that we observed with hst / stis showed no evidence of changes between the quadrature and superior conjunction phases .",
    "the x - ray flux was moderately low at the time of the observations ( see fig .  7 below ) .",
    "if the x - ray source ionized a large volume that included regions projected against the stellar disk in the superior conjunction phase , then portions of the blue absorption trough would weaken as the scattering ions are ionized to higher levels @xcite .",
    "however , we suspect that the ionized region is small compared to the system dimensions in the case of ls  5039 .",
    "@xcite use the same wind accretion model we discuss in  6 to show that the @xmath64 parameter defining the extent of the ionization zone scales as @xmath65 among mxrbs , where @xmath66 is the separation of the components and @xmath67 is the wind velocity relative to the neutron star . for the separation at the time of the _ hst _ near superior conjunction observation",
    ", we estimate that this parameter falls in the range @xmath68 , based upon a comparison with results for vela  x-1 from @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a strmgren sphere radius of approximately @xmath69 of the system separation ( see eq .",
    "[ 4 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum projected separation between the outer edge of the ionization sphere and stellar limb at the observed phase is approximately @xmath70 ( for an inclination @xmath71 ) , so that no occultation is expected .",
    "we suspect that any wind profile variations will be restricted to phases very close to superior conjunction and will only be observed if the system has a relatively large orbital inclination (  6 ) .",
    "the reddening and extinction of ls  5039 are directly related to the issues of the star s distance and space velocity (  6 ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite both argue that the reddening is @xmath72 , and @xcite suggest that the distance is @xmath73  kpc based upon an assumed absolute magnitude .",
    "the flux in the uv spectral range is very sensitive to the extinction curve @xcite , so we decided to re - investigate the reddening using the new stis spectra .",
    "the stis spectra are shown in figure  6 in a version rebinned to a resolving power of @xmath74 .",
    "we have included in figure  6 fluxes based upon johnson - cousins and near - ir photometry from @xcite and the 2mass survey @xcite , plus new strmgren @xmath75 , and @xmath76 measurements we made on 2002 june 24 using the ctio 0.9  m telescope and site @xmath77 ccd .",
    "we also observed six standard stars ( hd  105498 , hd  128726 , hd  156623 , hd  157795 , hd  167321 , and hd  216743 ) , taken from lists by @xcite and @xcite , in each band at a minimum of three different airmasses each to calibrate the photometry .",
    "all of the instrumental magnitudes were determined using a large aperture of 8 arcsec , and the photometric transformation equations from @xcite were applied to determine the apparent magnitudes of ls  5039 : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the errors in the magnitudes are from the combined estimated instrumental errors and the errors in the transformation constants .",
    "the ir measurements were transformed to fluxes using the nicmos units conversion tool .",
    "we determined fluxes from the optical band photometry using the iraf routine @xmath82 in the _ hst _ _ stsdas / synphot _ package .",
    "this was done by comparing the difference in calculated magnitude between a reddened model spectrum of ls  5039 ( a preliminary version of that discussed below ) and a spectrum of vega with the observed difference in magnitude ( using vega magnitudes from @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the model fluxes at the central filter wavelengths were then prorated to match the calculated and observed magnitude differences .",
    "we assumed that the model fluxes from @xcite for the spectroscopically determined parameters @xmath83 kk and @xmath44 provided a reliable estimate of the spectral flux distribution at the stellar photosphere .",
    "we then calculated how the observed spectrum at earth appears based upon the interstellar reddening curve given by @xcite .",
    "there are three parameters that determine the appearance of the transformed spectrum : the reddening , @xmath84 , the ratio of total to selective extinction at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and the ratio of stellar radius to distance , @xmath87 ( equivalent to half the angular diameter in radians ) .",
    "the first two parameters determine the shape of the extinction curve , while the final parameter is a normalization factor .",
    "we formed @xmath88 residuals for a grid of @xmath84 and @xmath89 values to find the best fit values that minimized @xmath88 .",
    "the best fit , shown by the solid line in figure  6 , was made with @xmath8 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( angular diameter = 0.03 mas ) .",
    "this transformed spectrum fits well the entire fuv to ir range .",
    "we also show @xmath92 deviations from this fit in @xmath84 ( _ dotted line _ ) and in @xmath89 ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "there are two nearby stars along the line of sight to ls  5039 that have comparable extinction : bd@xmath93 ( b1  iv ) with @xmath94 and @xmath95  kpc @xcite and bd@xmath96 ( o8  v ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98  kpc @xcite .",
    "our derived extinction of @xmath99 indicates that the distance to ls  5039 is greater than 1.9  kpc , which is consistent with prior estimates ( @xmath100  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , we estimated the probable secondary mass for a range in primary mass by comparing the observed and predicted x - ray fluxes for wind accretion .",
    "here we re - consider those arguments in light of the new results given above .",
    "the independent parameter is the mass of the o star , @xmath101 , that sets many of the other stellar parameters .",
    "the gravity determination from  3 , @xmath50 , establishes the relationship between mass and radius , @xmath102 , where the ratio of radiative acceleration by electron scattering to gravitational acceleration is @xmath103 .",
    "the specific relationship for ls  5039 based upon the derived effective temperature (  3 ) is @xmath104 .",
    "the fit of the observed flux distribution yields the angular diameter (  5 ) , which leads to a distance estimate of @xmath105  kpc ( somewhat closer than our prior estimate of @xmath106  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the wind mass loss rate using the equivalent width of the h@xmath10 emission line and the method of @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath10 profile appears as a deep absorption line in stars with minimal wind , and the feature becomes progressively filled - in as the mass loss rate increases ( appearing as a pure emission line in stars with strong winds ) .",
    "the mass loss rate depends upon the net emission equivalent width ( i.e. , the difference between the observed and purely photospheric absorption equivalent widths ) , the choice of the wind velocity law exponent @xmath107 , the wind terminal velocity @xmath60 , and the stellar effective temperature @xcite .",
    "we revised our assumptions about several of these parameters .",
    "we adopted @xmath108  kk (  3 ) and used the detailed optical flux model from @xcite to find the appropriate photospheric equivalent width for h@xmath10 , @xmath109   .",
    "we adopted a velocity law index of @xmath110 that @xcite advocate as the appropriate value for the weak wind case we find here .",
    "finally , we set the terminal velocity to @xmath111 km  s@xmath3 , the value we estimated from the wind profiles in the stis spectra (  4 ) .",
    "most of these changes result in a moderate decrease in the estimated mass loss rate ( table  5 , row 3 ) compared to our earlier results @xcite .",
    "we noted in the previous paper that the h@xmath10 strength appears to be variable on time - scales longer than our observing runs @xcite , which implies that there are long term variations in the mass loss rate .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that there are also long term variations in the x - ray flux that appear to be related to those observed in h@xmath10 .",
    "we show in figure  7 the time evolution of the x - ray flux in the 0.3  10 kev range reported by @xcite .",
    "figure  7 also illustrates the mass loss rate variations determined from the h@xmath10 equivalent widths from @xcite ( 3 measurements ) , @xcite ( 2 measurements ) , and our two recent observations ( @xmath112    and 2.95    for 2002 june 25 and 2003 march 21 , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath76-axes in figure  7 were scaled to overlap the x - ray flux and mass loss estimates as closely as possible , and we confirm that these two quantities appear to vary in concert in the limited data available .",
    "this result supports the wind accretion model and the validity of the mass loss estimates",
    ". it also points out the need to compare the predicted and observed accretion luminosities at an epoch when nearly simultaneous optical and x - ray data are available . here",
    "we will make the comparison for the closely spaced kpno coude feed @xcite and bepposax @xcite observations made in 2000 october , which correspond to a mass loss rate and x - ray flux minimum in figure  7 .",
    "we calculated the predicted wind accretion x - ray luminosity for a given @xmath101 and a grid of companion masses @xmath113 using the method of @xcite , and then we determined which @xmath113 value produced an x - ray luminosity that matched the observed value .",
    "this procedure was essentially the same as described earlier @xcite , but we improved our accretion rate estimate by finding the mean of rates for equal time samplings around the elliptical orbit and by adopting the observed projected rotational velocity (  3 ) in the calculation of the wind ",
    "companion relative velocity ( see eq .  [ 7b ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit masses are listed in table  5 and are illustrated in a mass plane diagram in figure  8 .",
    "note that the stellar radius is well within its critical roche radius at periastron in all these models , so that mass accretion by roche lobe overflow is probably not a significant process in ls  5039 .",
    "our revised @xmath113 estimates are smaller than but comparable to what we found previously ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that we relied in the earlier paper on an x - ray luminosity estimate that turned out to be a local maximum ( the first point shown in fig .",
    "7 ) , and this consequently required a larger @xmath113 to account for the accretion luminosity .",
    "the lightly shaded region surrounding the best - fit mass estimates in figure  8 shows how the solutions vary with changes in assumed parameters .",
    "the lower envelope corresponds to the calculations made using a wind velocity law exponent @xmath114 instead of the 1.0 value recommended by @xcite .",
    "a lower exponent corresponds to a higher mass loss estimate ( see fig .  15 in @xcite ) , and this must be balanced by a lower mass accretor in order to match the observed x - ray luminosity ( see eq .  [ 21 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the upper envelope shows the results obtained by assuming that the h@xmath10 equivalent width was @xmath92 larger ( @xmath115   ) than actually observed in 2000 october ( @xmath116   ) .",
    "the increased equivalent width corresponds to a weaker stellar wind ( less emission ) , and in fact the assumed value is close to that for no wind ( @xmath109   ) . here",
    "a reduction in wind strength is compensated by an increase in accretor mass in order to maintain the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "these tests indicate that our estimates for @xmath113 based upon the accretion model have formal errors of approximately @xmath117 . however , we caution that the actual errors may be larger because the simple wind accretion model does not account for the effects of the ionization of the wind by the x - ray source and because the efficiency parameter for conversion of accreted matter into x - ray radiation , @xmath118 , is only known approximately",
    ". nevertheless , our results for @xmath113 are consistent with a neutron star companion .",
    "there are several considerations that can help limit the range of acceptable mass for the o - star .",
    "the observed reddening of ls  5039 compared to nearby , line - of - sight stars indicates a minimum distance of 1.9  kpc (  5 ) , and this distance corresponds to a lower limit on the stellar mass of @xmath119 .",
    "the wind accretion solutions at the high mass end require increased mass loss rates and larger system dimensions ; such combinations occur at high inclinations according to the orbital mass function .",
    "the dashed line in figure  8 indicates the inclinations at which eclipses would begin to occur , and we see that for large @xmath101 the best - fit accretion models predict that eclipses should be observed . however , there is no evidence of either x - ray @xcite or optical @xcite eclipses despite significant efforts to find them .",
    "thus , the probable absence of eclipses and the results of the wind accretion model suggest an upper mass limit of approximately @xmath12 ( although masses as large as @xmath120 still fall within the error zone of the wind accretion model results ) .",
    "the wind properties offer additional constraints on the o - star mass .",
    "hot massive stars have a wind momentum product , @xmath121 , that is directly related to the stellar luminosity @xcite , and rows 3 and 4 of table  5 compare our h@xmath10 derived mass loss rate with that predicted by the empirical wind momentum relationship for galactic o - stars .",
    "the agreement appears best at the low mass end , but there is @xmath122  dex scatter in the wind momentum product among the stars that define the empirical relationship , so the full 20  @xmath123 range remains viable .",
    "table  5 also lists the ratio @xmath124 , which typically has a value of 2.6 in o - type stars @xcite .",
    "this criterion would again favor the lower mass range for ls  5039 , @xmath125 , but we caution that there is a large spread in this ratio among hot stars .",
    "indeed , @xcite find a ratio @xmath126 for the comparable on8  v star , hd  14633 , and @xcite quote ratio estimates in the range 0.8  2.8 in other mxrbs .",
    "the final row of table  5 gives estimates of the equatorial velocity @xmath127 that are derived from the projected rotational velocity assuming that the spin axis is aligned with the orbital axis ( see table  6 below ) and that the orbital inclination can be set from the wind accretion models .",
    "the eccentricity of the system probably results from the supernova event that formed the neutron star , and the current value of the eccentricity can be used to infer the pre - sn orbital parameters , assuming that no asymmetrical kick velocity was imparted to the neutron star during the explosion and that the eccentricity has not decreased since the sn @xcite .",
    "we show in the top portion of table  6 estimates of the pre - sn orbital period , @xmath128 , and mass of the sn - progenitor just prior to the sn , @xmath129 , based upon the current orbital elements , mass solutions from the wind accretion model , and the assumption of @xmath130 .",
    "there are several problems with these models that result from our revisions to the distance and eccentricity compared to earlier work @xcite .",
    "the paramount difficulty is the apparent discrepancy between the runaway velocity expected from the eccentricity and masses , @xmath131  ( predicted ) , and the peculiar space velocity , @xmath132  ( derived ) ( based upon the observed proper motion and radial velocity , the distance associated with a given stellar mass @xmath101 , and the method described in @xcite ) . the former is approximately twice as large as the latter , a much greater difference than expected from their formal errors ( approximately 14% and 19% , respectively ) .",
    "the second problem is that the predicted pre - sn orbital period is so short that the roche radius of the o - star is smaller than or equal to the estimated stellar radius .",
    "a third , potential , difficulty is the relatively large mass of the sn - progenitor compared to theoretical expectations @xcite .    all of these problems can be alleviated by removing the assumption that the sn kick velocity was zero .",
    "there is now a significant body of evidence that non - zero kick velocities must occur in sn @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a sn kick velocity will dramatically influence the post - sn orbital parameters and system runaway velocity . following the development of @xcite",
    ", we can express the final outcome parameters in terms of two ratios , @xmath133 and @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the values of the kick velocity and pre - sn relative orbital velocity , respectively .",
    "we also need to specify the direction of the kick in terms of @xmath137 , the angle between the sn - progenitor s orbital motion and the kick - velocity vector projected onto the pre - sn orbital plane , and @xmath138 , the angle between the kick direction and the pre - sn orbital plane ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "with these four parameters selected we can determine the post - sn eccentricity , system runaway velocity , and angle @xmath139 of misalignment between the o - star rotation axis and the current orbital angular momentum vector ( see eq .",
    "[ 2.8 , 2.10 , 2.16 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "we explored the possible solutions applicable to ls  5039 by calculating the predicted final eccentricity and runaway velocity over a grid of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "our strategy was to compute @xmath142 and @xmath131 for each set of parameters , and if the results in both cases were within @xmath143 of the observed values , then we saved the increment of solid angle corresponding to the test values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 in our grid .",
    "we omitted any models that led to a pre - sn orbit with an o - star roche radius smaller than the observed value and any kick directions that would have the sn - remnant strike the o - star .",
    "our final results are shown in figure  9 for the masses associated with our @xmath144 wind accretion model .",
    "the grayscale intensity in this figure is directly proportional to the integrated solid angle of acceptable solutions for given values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , so that the figure may be interpreted as a geometrical probability estimate ( white corresponding to no solutions possible , black corresponding to the maximum integrated solid angle of acceptable solutions in the @xmath145 grid ) .",
    "the high frequency `` ripples '' in the image result from the coarseness of our angular grid ( increments of @xmath146 in @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) and our hard boundaries of @xmath147 for acceptable solutions .",
    "there is a broad range of solutions in the @xmath145 plane , but the geometrically favored solutions are concentrated in two regions .",
    "the first occurs along a ridge in the lower portion of the diagram near @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the solutions correspond to kicks in the direction @xmath150 , i.e. , in approximately the same direction as the orbital motion of the progenitor at the time of the sn .",
    "the pre - sn orbital parameters for such prograde ( @xmath151 ) solutions are given in the middle portion of table  6 , which lists the solid angle weighted average values of initial period , kick velocity , and misalignment .",
    "we find initial periods similar to the no kick case but the progenitor masses are lower .",
    "the associated kick velocities are small and consistent with the low values found by @xcite and by @xcite for other mxrbs .",
    "@xcite suggest that small kick velocities may occur in close binaries in which the sn - progenitor was a rapid rotator at the time of the sn ( i.e. , in those which avoided spin down in a red - supergiant phase ) .",
    "the other geometrically favored region occurs near @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and these solutions correspond to retrograde kicks ( @xmath154 ) with @xmath155 .",
    "the lower portion of table  6 gives the pre - sn orbital parameters for such solutions that have a longer initial period ( and larger roche radii ) than the other solutions .",
    "the kick velocities are much larger than before , but still within the range considered reasonable in other investigations @xcite .",
    "however , the largest kick velocities permitted in figure  9 ( for @xmath156 km  s@xmath3 and @xmath157 ) are probably too extreme for most of the commonly accepted kick velocity distributions .",
    "we expect that the binary probably suffered a significant reduction in orbital period during a spiral - in , common envelope phase prior to the sn explosion @xcite . at the conclusion of this stage",
    "the stars were in a short period orbit , and the strong tidal forces would ensure quick spin synchronization and circularization of the orbit @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the average synchronous rotation speed prior to the sn , @xmath158 , using @xmath159 ( table  5 ) and @xmath160 ( table  6 ) , and we list these estimates for the @xmath151 and @xmath154 cases in table  6 .",
    "the synchronous rotation speeds are smaller than the observed value of projected rotational velocity ( @xmath7 km  s@xmath3 ) for the @xmath154 models , so we prefer the solutions for the @xmath151 models . the sn progenitor may also have been a rapid rotator as a result of tidal synchronization , and the lower kick velocities associated with the @xmath151 models are consistent with the suggestion that smaller kicks occur in rapid rotators @xcite",
    ". however , regardless of the choice of the model for the sn event in ls  5039 , it is clear that a modest , non - zero kick velocity is required to explain consistently the observed eccentricity and runaway velocity .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that we find clear evidence of cno processed gas in the photosphere of ls  5039 while the spectral signature of cno processed gas is generally absent in other mxrbs ( with the interesting exceptions of vela  x-1 = hd  77581 @xcite and 4u170037 = hd  153919 @xcite ) .",
    "the n - enriched gas has two possible sources , nuclear processed gas from the interior of the o - star and/or processed gas from the envelope of the neutron star progenitor .",
    "here we briefly discuss the issues associated with both sources of enriched gas .",
    "the origin of the he and n enrichment in the obn and other evolved massive stars is probably related to rotationally induced mixing of the stellar interiors . @xcite and @xcite have constructed stellar models that include rotation , and they find that significant mixing of cno processed gas into the photosphere can occur over a main sequence lifetime in rapidly rotating , massive stars .",
    "@xcite found that the obn stars have a projected rotational velocity distribution consistent with the assumption that they represent a class of rapid rotators , and they showed that he is enhanced in several very rapidly rotating o - type stars .",
    "the projected rotational velocity of ls  5039 ( @xmath7 km  s@xmath3 ) is not unusually large for o - type stars @xcite , and the star s spin axis inclination , @xmath161 , would need to be relatively small if the star is currently a rapid rotator ( see @xmath127 estimates in table  5 ) .",
    "we showed above that the star could have been a rapid rotator due to tidal interactions prior to the sn ( see the @xmath151 solutions in table  6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we doubt that significant rotationally induced mixing has occurred since then because the elapsed time since the sn implied by the kinematical age ( @xmath162  my ; @xcite ) is much smaller than the characteristic time for large scale mixing ( comparable to the main sequence lifetime , @xmath163  my ; @xcite ) . therefore , we doubt that the n - enrichment of ls  5039 is due to internal mixing unless the o - star was born as a rapid rotator and mixing has progressed for a long time ( i.e. , the lifetime of the neutron star progenitor plus the kinematical age ) .",
    "the alternative explanation is that the nuclear processed gas was accreted from the sn progenitor .",
    "the system had a short orbital period prior to the sn explosion ( table  6 ) that probably resulted from a spiral - in during a common - envelope phase ( cep ) @xcite .",
    "the surviving o - star probably accreted relatively little material during the cep because of its short duration , and accretion following the cep must have been very limited because mass transfer at that point would have caused an expansion of the orbit @xcite . instead we suspect that the cno - enriched gas was transferred from the progenitor during a period immediately prior to the start of the cep .",
    "massive donor stars with radiative envelopes can in some circumstances sustain a stable mass transfer rate through roche lobe overflow until the envelope is lost @xcite , and it is possible that several solar masses of enriched gas were accreted by the o - star gainer during this evolutionary stage .",
    "other explanations such as direct wind fed accretion @xcite and accretion of the impacting sn shell @xcite are less compelling because the amount of enriched gas accreted in both cases is relatively minor .",
    "many of the black hole mxrbs are also thought to have evolved from widely separated binaries into compact systems through a common envelope stage @xcite , and it is curious that these do not generally show the n enrichment we find in ls  5039 .",
    "the explanation may be related to the youth of ls  5039 @xcite .",
    "we suspect that thermohaline mixing @xcite , rotational mixing , and stellar wind mass loss will act to remove the enriched gas from the atmosphere so that the n enrichment may decline with the time elapsed since the sn .",
    "ls  5039 may represent an unusually young mxrb in which these processes have yet to make a significant change in the atmospheric abundances , so that the products of the intense binary interaction remain vividly intact in the stellar atmosphere .",

    "<S> the observed eccentricity and runaway velocity of the binary can only be reconciled if the neutron star received a modest kick velocity due to a slight asymmetry in the supernova explosion ( during which @xmath13 was ejected ) . </S>"
