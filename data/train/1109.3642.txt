    "at low temperatures , thermodynamic properties of fermions with a repulsive interaction bear strong resemblance to those of an ideal fermi gas . this is the quintessence of the landau theory of the fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "it is assumed in this theory that interaction effects merely renormalize quantities such as the fermion mass or the density of states .",
    "in fact , this renormalization can be large for a strong interaction , thus making perturbative methods inapplicable .",
    "however , such obstacles are always overcome once the renormalized quantities are replaced by phenomenological effective parameters .    following the similarity to the ideal fermi gas",
    ", one could expect that quantities like @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermi liquid s specific heat , or its spin susceptibility  @xmath4 had to be analytic functions of @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the fermi energy and  @xmath7 the temperature . [ in the leading order in  @xmath7 , one should have a finite @xmath8 considered as a phenomenological fermi liquid parameter .",
    "] however , several studies revealed for three - dimensional fermi liquids the existence of corrections to the specific heat @xmath9 of the order @xmath10 , which is incompatible with ideal fermi gases.@xcite in three dimensions , there are also logarithmic contributions @xmath11 to the non - homogeneous spin susceptibility @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wave vector .",

    "the linear in  @xmath7 correction to @xmath14 has been verified experimentally in a @xmath15 fluid monolayer.@xcite    the problem of evaluating the anomalous contributions was reconsidered in ref .   with the help of a supersymmetric field theory especially designed to describe those low energy bosonic excitations which are responsible for the anomalous contributions to the thermodynamics .",
    "it was found that earlier calculations@xcite had not been complete and so far unforeseen logarithmic contributions to @xmath16 were discovered for dimensions  @xmath17 .",
    "similar anomalous contributions have been found for the spin susceptibility  @xmath18 using either the supersymmetric method mentioned above@xcite or the conventional diagrammatic technique@xcite .",
    "both the methods led to identical results for the spin susceptibility in 2d models .    in dimension  @xmath19 , the supersymmetric approach to find the spin susceptibility@xcite reproduced the results of earlier theoretical works@xcite .",
    "as to the specific heat of a one - dimensional fermi gas , the result of the supersymmetric field theory of ref .   can be mapped on known results for the kondo model@xcite or for the @xmath20 spin-@xmath21 chain@xcite , showing agreement .",
    "a more recent study@xcite confirmed the supersymmetry approach using the conventional diagrammatic technique .    in spite of the agreement between the results obtained by these different methods in one dimension , a direct diagrammatic computation of the anomalous specific heat carried out up to the third order in the fermion - fermion interaction by chubukov and maslov ( cm ) for the 2d fermi liquid@xcite led to a result that did not coincide with the one obtained by the supersymmetric approach in ref .  .",
    "both of them contained logarithmic corrections to the anomalous contributions .",
    "however , while in the framework of the supersymmetry method of ref .  , the non - trivial contributions originated purely from spin excitations , cm obtained contributions from both spin and charge excitations .",
    "they attributed the difference between the results to the fact that not all effects of the finite curvature of the fermi surface had been properly taken into account in the approach of ref .  .",
    "of course , curvature effects are absent in one dimension and charge excitations do not influence the spin susceptibility  @xmath18 in any dimension in the non - logarithmic lowest order in the interaction . as a result , no discrepancy could be seen in these cases .",
    "nevertheless , since evidently certain effects of the finite curvature of the fermi surface were neglected in the supersymmetric method of ref .  , it is important to find the correct way of calculations .",
    "at the same time , approaches based of the conventional diagrammatic expansions for fermions become inapplicable beyond some low orders of perturbation theory . indeed , cm performed a standard perturbation theory to third order and treated higher orders by plausibility arguments.@xcite    in this paper , we revise the approach of ref .   for the 2d fermi liquid taking into account all the necessary effects of the curvature of the fermi surface . as a result , we are able to sum up all leading logarithms , thus correcting the previous result for the function @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) . to third order in the interaction potential",
    ", our result agrees with the conventional perturbative calculation@xcite .",
    "moreover , our result in all orders in the large logarithm  @xmath22 shares the same asymptotic behavior as the conjecture suggested by cm . in principle , our method and results are applicable for both repulsion and attraction unless one reaches a singularity in the final formulas .",
    "we argue that the singularities , if existing , correspond to the singlet or triplet cooper superconducting pairing .",
    "remarkably , the final formula for the function @xmath23 contains a sum of separated spin singlet and spin triplet excitations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the modification concerns the dimensions @xmath24 only , whereas the method leads for @xmath19 to the same results as those obtained in ref .  .",
    "the calculations are performed using a modification of a recently suggested bosonization scheme of refs .  .",
    "in contrast to these previous works , we derive an effective supersymmetric action describing only low - lying modes .",
    "this is achieved by singling out the slowly varying pairs of the fermionic field in the interaction term .",
    "subsequently , we decouple this interaction by means of hubbard - stratonovich auxiliary fields slowly varying in space and imaginary time  similarly to what was done in ref .  .",
    "here , however , this decoupling is followed by the derivation of equations of motion using the method of refs .  .",
    "in contrast to the equations of ref .  , the present equations preserve all necessary effects of the curvature of the fermi surface .",
    "the solution of the equations of motion is represented in a form of an integral over superfields  @xmath25 , which do not only depend on conventional coordinates @xmath26 and imaginary time @xmath27 but also on anticommuting variables @xmath28 .",
    "this integral representation allows to average over the auxiliary fields before we obtain the final effective field theory for the low energy bosonic charge and spin excitations .",
    "such a representation , suggested in refs .",
    ", differs from the supervector representation used in ref .   and is considerably more convenient for explicit calculations .",
    "although the general calculational scheme based on this superfield action shares certain similarities with that of ref .  , the finite curvature of the fermi surface suppresses several otherwise logarithmic contributions .",
    "consequently , different final results are obtained as a result of a different calculational procedure .",
    "for instance , the quartic part of the action can be renormalized by summing ladder diagram series instead of solving renormalization group equations .",
    "the calculations performed here can be important not only from the point of view of finding the complete picture about the anomalous contributions to the thermodynamics of the 2d fermi liquid but also as a demonstration of how the higher - dimensional bosonization scheme suggested in refs .",
    "can be used as a method in analytical studies .",
    "the experience gained on this comparably simple example may become important for attacking more difficult and more interesting problems of strongly correlated systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
