    "the standard paradigm for long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) involves a broad - lined type ic supernova ( sn ic - bl ) with @xmath6 mag @xcite , such as those predicted by the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "this is based on spectroscopic evidence in sne from low - luminosity grbs @xcite , such as sn  1998bw accompanying grb  980425 @xcite , as well as relatively - higher - luminosity grbs , such as sn  2003dh accompanying grb  030329 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for the two low - redshift cases of grb  060505 and grb  060614 no associated sn was found to deep limits @xcite , but since then no similar events have been reported .",
    "grb 130427a @xcite is remarkable as it is both extremely energetic and located at a moderately low redshift of @xmath2 ( @xcite and this work ) . using the spectral parameters for the prompt emission given by @xcite",
    ", we derive an isotropic @xmath0-ray energycdm cosmology with @xmath7  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "] of @xmath11  erg in the 110000  kev rest - frame energy band .",
    "the optical afterglow peaked at @xmath12 mag during the prompt emission phase @xcite .",
    "only @xmath13 of all grbs with measured redshifts are at such a low distance ( see e.g. @xcite ; figure  [ eisoz ] ) , and those are usually low - luminosity events .",
    "by contrast , grb  130427a was an extremely energetic burst , and hence it has allowed detailed studies of a system similar to those usually only found at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "due to the dearth of such extremely luminous grbs at low redshift and their faintness at high redshift , we so far have had no spectroscopic evidence for accompanying sne in very energetic grbs with @xmath14 erg ( for photometric evidence of a sn associated with very energetic grb  080319b , see @xcite ) . in figure  [ eisoz ]",
    "we show the @xmath0-ray energy release of grbs as a function of redshift .",
    "overplotted are systems with spectroscopic evidence for a sn .",
    "grb  130427a stands out as an exceptional system .",
    "it is unclear if progenitor models involving a sn can power such energetic grbs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and observationally it has proven hard to test the sn properties of these events . in this work",
    "we focus on the search for and discovery of a sn accompanying this remarkable burst .",
    "our first follow - up photometry was carried out at the 1-m optical telescope located in weihai , shandong province , china .",
    "the bright optical counterpart of the grb was well detected in the cousins @xmath15 filter with @xmath16 mag at 4.178 hr post - burst .",
    "initially , sdss filters were not available at the telescope , but 2 days into our monitoring campaign , sdss @xmath4 and @xmath17 filters were installed and have been available since then .",
    "our photometric follow - up observations were mainly obtained at the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) equipped with the alfosc instrument .",
    "photometry was primarily obtained in the @xmath4-band , complemented by @xmath18 data useful to monitor the spectral evolution of the counterpart . as shown in figure  [ field ] , there is indication from the not images that the grb counterpart lies in the nw part of an extended host galaxy . with our spatial resolution ,",
    "the afterglow is blended with the host , and we thus use a relatively big aperture ( @xmath19 diameter ) to measure the magnitudes of the counterpart plus host . using a smaller aperture",
    "would provide lower fluxes , but with a host contribution hard to quantify , especially at late times ( i.e. , since @xmath20 days after the burst ) . in this way",
    ", we consistently include most of the host light .",
    "additionally , follow - up observations were obtained at the 2.16-m telescope in xinglong , hebei province , china .",
    "photometry was done in the cousins @xmath15 and @xmath21 filters and then transformed to sdss @xmath4 and @xmath17 magnitudes based on our afterglow spectra .",
    "all optical data were reduced in a standard way using iraf v2.15 in the scisoft 7.7 package .",
    "magnitudes were calibrated with two nearby bright sdss field stars , sdss j113230.55 + 274420.3 and sdss j113220.11 + 274133.5 , whose zero - point errors are 0.01 mag and propagated into the final magnitude measurements .",
    "the sdss @xmath4-band lightcurve is presented in figure  [ rlc ] and a log of the observations is shown in table  [ log ] .",
    "we fit the not multi - color photometry taken in the first night after the trigger ( @xmath22 mag , @xmath23 mag , @xmath24 mag , @xmath25 mag ) and the simultaneous xrt spectrum . using synchrotron models and extinction laws from the local group ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , we estimate the reddening of the host to be @xmath26  mag for a mw - type extinction law . within the errors ,",
    "this value is consistent with what derived assuming an smc or lmc extinction law , because of the small amount of reddening and wavelength range probed by our observations .",
    "our first spectrum was obtained using not / alfosc .",
    "the total exposure was 1800 s with a mean time of 0.44 days post - burst .",
    "the spectrum covers the range 32009100   with a resolving power of @xmath27 .",
    "we identify prominent absorption lines of 2796 & 2803 , 2852 and 3934 & 3968 , as well as weak emission lines of [ ] 3727 and h@xmath28 , all at a common redshift of @xmath29 .",
    "a second spectrum with intermediate resolution was obtained shortly afterwards using the very large telescope ( vlt ) equipped with the x - shooter spectrograph . in the spectra",
    "the continuum was well detected in the full range 300024800   .",
    "a number of absorption features are visible , including 2344 , 2577 , 2796 & 2803 , 2852 , 3074 , 3934 & 3968 , 5890 & 5896 , and emission lines such as [ ] 3727 , h@xmath28 , [ ] 5007 , and h@xmath30 , all at a common redshift of @xmath2 . in the x - shooter spectrum",
    "d 5890 & 5896 absorption was detected at the redshift of the host .",
    "we measure @xmath31 and @xmath32   for the equivalent widths of the d1 and d2 components . using the relations in @xcite",
    ", we obtain an estimate for @xmath33  mag , but remark that there exists substantial dispersion of @xmath34  mag in this relation . considering different calibrations / systematics involved in above @xmath35 measurements , we adopt @xmath36mag for the host extinction .",
    "given the relatively low redshift , we planned a third spectroscopic observation with the aim of detecting the sn signatures .",
    "based on the light curve evolution , we obtained a spectrum of the optical counterpart and host galaxy with the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) 16.7 days after the grb .",
    "this corresponds to 12.5 days in the grb rest frame .",
    "observations consisted of @xmath37  s , covering the range of 480010000   with a resolving power of @xmath38 .",
    "the slit was oriented to cover both the afterglow position and the host galaxy nucleus .",
    "all spectroscopic data were reduced in a standard way using dedicated iraf pipelines or eso pipelines .",
    "the resulting spectra are presented in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "we use the catalogued pre - explosion imaging from the sdss data release @xcite to estimate physical properties of the grb host galaxy and to build a physical model of the stellar emission .",
    "the sdss @xmath39 photometry was fitted within lephare @xcite using stellar population synthesis models from @xcite as detailed in @xcite .",
    "based on the model fit to the data ( figure  [ spectrum ] ) , we derive a luminosity @xmath40 mag , a stellar mass of @xmath41 , a star - formation rate @xmath42  yr@xmath8 and an age of the starburst of @xmath43  myr for the host of grb  130427a .",
    "host galaxy emission lines are detected above the sn continuum , including [ ] 6584 in the gtc spectrum , albeit at low significance .",
    "this allows us to place constraints on the metallicity of the explosion host environment by using the calibrations in @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath44 and @xmath45 by using the o3n2 and the n2 methods , respectively ( statistical errors only ) , which is at the top - right of the grb - sn range in the metallicity@xmath46 plane and similar to the cases of sne ic - bl without observed grbs and sne ib+iib ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the host galaxy also nicely lies within the 1@xmath47 dispersion of the mass - metallicity relation for normal field galaxies @xcite . after including the systematic dispersion of 0.14 and 0.18 dex @xcite for the two methods , these results translate to a metallicity of @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we scaled the gtc spectrum with our simultaneous photometry from the same night , dereddened it for @xmath51mag @xcite in the milky way galaxy , and then subtracted the model host galaxy spectrum , after bringing it to the same resolution , in order to obtain a `` clean '' spectrum of the transient .",
    "afterwards , the spectrum is dereddened by @xmath52mag for the host extinction at @xmath53 .",
    "both the original and the final gtc spectra are shown in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "although the resulting spectrum is noisy , it shows clear sn features , with the most prominent being a strong bump peaking at @xmath54   ( observer - frame ; @xmath55   rest - frame ) .",
    "the features are broad ( and no h or he can be seen ) , justifying the classification of sn  2013cq as a sn ic - bl @xcite .",
    "sn  1998bw @xcite , associated with grb  980425 , does not provide a good spectral match to sn  2013cq , mainly because its main peak is located more to the red ( rest - frame @xmath56   at similar phases ) . the same is true for sn  2006aj @xcite , associated with grb  060218 .",
    "instead , we find a better match with sn  2010bh , associated with grb  100316d , which is known to have high expansion velocities , up to 10000 km s@xmath8 higher than other previous sne ic - bl associated with grbs at all phases @xcite .",
    "in particular , the best match is obtained with the spectrum of sn  2010bh at a rest - frame time of 12.7 days , very close to the rest - frame 12.5 days for sn  2013cq here ( shown in figure  [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the similarity to sn2010bh is striking although there may be small colour differences ( e.g. , difference redward of @xmath577500   ) , which may reflect the diversity in grb - sn spectra and/or the uncertain extinction correction towards sn2010bh . considering that the p - cygni feature on the left of the strong bump can be primarily attributed to 5169 , we measure an expansion velocity of @xmath58 km s@xmath8 from the absorption minimum .",
    "this is very similar to the peak photospheric velocity , @xmath59",
    "km s@xmath8 , of sn  2010bh @xcite .      the @xmath4-band lightcurve presented in figure  [ rlc ] has been corrected for the foreground extinction ( @xmath51 mag ) . from the foreground - extinction - corrected flux we subtract the contribution of the host galaxy ( @xmath60 , as determined via photometry on pre - explosion sdss imaging ) , so that the flux powering the lightcurve can be attributed solely to the afterglow and accompanying sn .",
    "visual inspection of the light curve reveals a deviation away from a power - law decay a few days post - burst , followed by a plateau that lasts for about 10 days , before decaying further . at the gtc spectrum time",
    "the galactic - extinction - corrected flux of the sn / afterglow is 1.85 times that of the host galaxy .",
    "next , we fit a smoothly broken power - law model @xcite to the lightcurve up to the first four days ( some @xmath4-band data points @xmath61  days published in gcns are used for the fitting ; @xcite ) , and derive the following best - fit parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 days ( the smoothness factor of the break is fixed to be unity and @xmath65/dof = 1.47 for 7 dof ) .",
    "this afterglow model is then subtracted from the already host - subtracted lightcurve , and the resultant flux resembles that of a supernova both in brightness and shape ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak brightness of sn  2013cq is found to be @xmath66 mag at @xmath67 days observer - frame ( @xmath68 days rest - frame ) . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the observer - frame @xmath4 band corresponds approximately to the rest - frame @xmath69 band , and we find that sn  2013cq has an absolute @xmath69-band magnitude of @xmath70 , which is about 0.2 mag fainter than sn  1998bw .",
    "we then compare the optical properties of sn  2013cq relative to two other grb - associated sne : sn  1998bw and sn  2010bh .",
    "we create synthetic @xmath4-band light curves of sn  1998bw and sn  2010bh as they would appear at @xmath29 .",
    "next , using equations 1 and 2 from @xcite , we determine the stretch ( @xmath71 ) and luminosity factor ( @xmath72 ) of sn  2013cq relative to sn  1998bw to be @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we further estimate the bolometric properties of sn  2013cq .",
    "the method , developed by @xcite , uses the relative stretch and luminosity factors of a sn relative to a template ( in this case sn  1998bw ) , and makes the assumption that the relative shape of a given sn in a given filter is a good proxy for the relative shape of the sn bolometric light curve relative to the template .",
    "the bolometric light curve of the template filters . ]",
    "is then altered by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and then fit with an analytical model derived from @xcite .",
    "the arnett model depends on knowing the photospheric velocity at peak bolometric light to determine the ejecta mass and explosion energy , which for many sne is determined from the velocity of different species in the sn spectra at peak light .",
    "we have used the photospheric velocity value determined in section [ subsec : gtc ] ( i.e. @xmath58 km s@xmath8 ) . on comparison with sn  1998bw , for sn  2013cq ( in @xmath75 )",
    "we derived its ni mass , ejecta mass , and kinetic energy @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 erg , respectively .",
    "the quoted errors are statistical only .",
    "our photometric and spectroscopic campaign has led to the unambiguous discovery of a sn ic - bl , sn  2013cq @xcite , associated with grb  130427a at @xmath29 .",
    "grb  130427a is one of the most energetic bursts ever detected with @xmath79 , comparable to that of high - redshift grbs and much larger than local events .",
    "the fact that a supernova progenitor model accounts for even very energetic bursts suggests a common progenitor model , such as the collapsar model , may account for the majority of all long - duration grbs . to overcome the challenge of providing enough energy to power the grb , it is likely that the large observed energy is due",
    "to beaming ( for a strong beaming of grb  130427a , see @xcite ) , making the true energy much lower ( typically two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "our discovery now suggests that not only core - collapse sne , but specifically stripped envelope , high velocity sne are almost an inevitable consequence of the deaths of stars that form all grbs .",
    "a common mechanism is therefore at play to power grbs with very different high - energy properties .",
    "it is worth noting that the comparable peak @xmath69-band luminosity of sn  2013cq and of sn  1998bw is consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that there is an upper envelope to the brightness of grb - sne which drops slightly with isotropic luminosity .",
    "the origin of such an upper envelope is intriguing , but currently not clear .",
    "as shown in @xcite , among previous grb - sn events , the highest oxygen abundance @xmath80 at the sn position was less than 8.3 , and when the oxygen abundance rises towards a seemingly critical value of 8.5 , grb - sn events tend to locate in dwarf galaxies with @xmath81 mag .",
    "note that the abundance value of 8.5 is a typical one for sne ic - bl without observed grbs which occur in both luminous and dwarf galaxies and also it is typical for sne ib+iib which happen in relatively luminous galaxies with @xmath82 mag @xcite . with an abundance of @xmath83 for the sn position and @xmath40 mag for the host , grb  130427a / sn",
    "2013cq is consistent with subclasses of core - collapse sne such as sne ic - bl without observed grbs and sne ib+iib in the metallicity@xmath46 plane , implying that grbs do not exclusively explode in low metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
