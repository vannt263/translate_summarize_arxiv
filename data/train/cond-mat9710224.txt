    "arrays of josephson junctions are of interest in several branches of physics  @xcite .",
    "they have many technological applications , including high - frequency emitters and detectors , parametric amplifiers , local oscillators , and voltage standards  @xcite .",
    "they also shed light on the structural  @xcite and pinning  @xcite properties of the high - t@xmath2 superconducting cuprates .",
    "at the same time , they provide model systems for the study of problems in both spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics  @xcite and nonequilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the depinning transitions and nonlinear wave propagation seen in josephson arrays are analogous to those found in incommensurate systems , earthquake models , type ii superconductors , and charge - density waves .    from the standpoint of dynamical systems theory  @xcite",
    ", josephson arrays can be viewed as large collections of coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "unfortunately , because of their nonlinearity and large number of degrees of freedom , these arrays are inherently difficult to analyze mathematically .",
    "a further complication is that there is an intrinsic physical coupling among junctions , due to fluxoid quantization , which is more awkward to handle than the nearest - neighbor interaction usually assumed in idealized models of coupled oscillators . and",
    "when the effects of self - fields and inductances are included , there is even less hope of making analytical progress .    despite these obstacles ,",
    "some encouraging advances have occurred recently in the mathematical analysis of josephson arrays , especially for one - dimensional ( 1-d ) systems where the junctions are connected in series  @xcite or in parallel  @xcite .",
    "the logical next step is to tackle two - dimensional ( 2-d ) arrays .",
    "much of the previous theoretical work on 2-d arrays has focused on numerical simulation of the current - voltage characteristics  @xcite , in an effort to link the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of 2-d arrays to the averaged quantities that are most readily measured experimentally . on the mathematical side ,",
    "there are recent indications that 2-d arrays , like their 1-d counterparts , are also going to be tractable in some regimes  @xcite .    an ideal example to explore the crossover between 1-d and 2-d behavior is the josephson ladder array ( figure  [ fig : ladder ] ) . following kardar  @xcite , several authors have studied various statistical properties of the frustrated ladder , including its ground state , the complicated landscape of solutions at zero temperature , the low - lying excitations , and the linear response regime  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these authors restricted attention to ladders in the absence of a driving current .",
    "only recently has the fully dynamical problem been addressed , through numerical simulations of the depinning transition  @xcite and vortex propagation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the tools of nonlinear dynamics to analyze the superconducting states of ladder arrays .",
    "( other dynamical regimes will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite . )",
    "mathematically , the superconducting states correspond to fixed points of the governing circuit equations .",
    "we study the bifurcations of these fixed points with respect to variations in the applied dc bias current @xmath0 and the frustration @xmath1 introduced by an external magnetic field . as @xmath0",
    "is increased from @xmath3 at fixed @xmath1 , we find that the stable superconducting states are destroyed in saddle - node bifurcations at certain critical values of the current",
    ". then the system depins from its original static configuration and evolves toward some other state .",
    "the new state might be another fixed point , or it might be a running solution , in which case a nonzero dc voltage appears across the array .",
    "global depinning of the array occurs when the last stable fixed point is destroyed .",
    "one of the main results of our analysis is a set of approximate analytical formulas for the critical currents at which the fixed points are destroyed , as a function of @xmath1 , for the three most important types of superconducting states : the no - vortex , fully - frustrated and single - vortex solutions .",
    "another important finding is that symmetry plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the ladder . as we will show below ,",
    "much of the behavior of the ladder can be understood by focusing on states that are `` up - down symmetric ''  in other words , states where the phases of the horizontal junctions on the top and bottom of any given plaquette are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign at all times .",
    "all of the stable superconducting states possess this symmetry .",
    "even when the parameters are chosen so that depinning occurs , the subsequent transients and long - term running solutions typically remain up - down symmetric .",
    "but there is at least one exception : when the single - vortex state is destabilized by lowering the frustration @xmath1 below some critical value @xmath4 , the system depins via a symmetry - breaking bifurcation . during the transient behavior ,",
    "the up - down symmetry is lost temporarily , but is then recovered as the system expels flux from the array and evolves toward the no - vortex state .",
    "these symmetry considerations establish an unexpected link between the study of josephson arrays and some recent developments in nonlinear dynamics . in mathematical terms , the up - down symmetric states of a ladder array form an invariant manifold of the full state space .",
    "a symmetry - breaking bifurcation occurs when this manifold loses stability in a transverse direction . the same issue  the transverse stability of an invariant manifold",
    " arises in the study of riddled basins , synchronized chaos , on - off intermittency , and blowout bifurcations  @xcite .",
    "these connections suggest a promising line of future research on josephson arrays , particularly with regard to their chaotic states .",
    "we will also show that the dynamics of ladder arrays are very strongly influenced by edge effects .",
    "one might have supposed these effects to be negligible , especially in long ladders , since their influence on the superconducting solutions dies off exponentially fast away from the boundaries .",
    "yet although the edges do indeed have a small effect on the _ form _ of the superconducting solutions , they have a large effect on the _ stability _ of those solutions .",
    "much of this paper is devoted to investigating the effects of the edges , first on the superconducting states themselves , then on their stability , and finally on the entire phase diagram .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system ] reviews the model equations for the ladder and discusses their symmetry properties . in section  [ sec : analytical ] we obtain analytical approximations for three numerically observed superconducting solutions : the no - vortex ( nv ) , single - vortex ( sv ) , and fully - frustrated ( ff ) solutions . in all cases , edge effects are taken into account via perturbation theory .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : depinning ] we describe the dynamical simulations which reveal the depinning properties of the nv , sv , and ff configurations and relate them to the global depinning of the ladder . in section  [ sec : bifurc ] we establish the rigorous connection of the dynamical depinning with the stability of these three fixed points . for all of them",
    ", we characterize the bifurcations and study their stability diagrams , both in the presence and in the absence of edges . when possible , analytical approximations to the critical currents are obtained .",
    "we show that the depinning transitions correspond to saddle - node bifurcations that are edge - dominated for almost all values of the frustration .",
    "moreover , we find that some of the superconducting states can be destabilized via a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation as the frustration is reduced ; in physical terms , this is a symmetry - breaking bifurcation in which flux is expelled _ transversally _ from the ladder . in the final section",
    "we summarize our conclusions in two phase diagrams ( for ladders with and without edges ) , and we relate our results to those found by previous authors .",
    "we also add two more technical appendices : appendix a compares the single - vortex configuration in the ladder with the corresponding kink - like solution in 1-d parallel arrays ; appendix b briefly indicates how to extend our approach to include self - inductance effects .",
    "we study an open - ended josephson ladder with @xmath5 square plaquettes , i.e. , an array formed by two rows of @xmath6 weakly coupled superconducting islands ( figure  [ fig : ladder ] ) .",
    "the array is driven by a perpendicular uniform dc current @xmath0 , and a magnetic field is applied transverse to the plane of the device .",
    "each weak link between islands constitutes a junction .",
    "its state is described by the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath7 , arising from the macroscopic character of the quantum wavefunction of the superconductors .",
    "assuming zero temperature , negligible charging ( quantum ) effects , and identical junctions , the dynamics of each junction is given , in the three - channel rcsj model  @xcite , by the nonlinear differential equation @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the mccumber parameter  @xcite ; @xmath10 is given in units of the critical current of each ( identical ) junction ; derivatives are with respect to time normalized in units of @xmath11 , the inverse of the plasma frequency ; and @xmath12 is shorthand for the nonlinear differential operator defined by  ( [ eq : pendulum ] ) . thus , each junction is formally equivalent to a damped driven pendulum  @xcite .",
    "the junctions are _ intrinsically _ coupled , even when inductances are neglected , through two physical restrictions : the quantization of the magnetic flux through each plaquette , and kirchhoff s current conservation law at each node . when all inductances are zero , i.e. , self - fields are neglected , the flux quantization condition for the array in figure  [ fig : ladder ] becomes @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the _ external _ magnetic flux in units of the flux quantum @xmath14 .",
    "the set of integers @xmath15 indicate the presence ( @xmath16 ) or absence ( @xmath17 ) of topological vortices in each plaquette when the phases are restricted to the interval @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , kirchhoff s current law yields @xmath19 at the interior nodes of the ladder . at the left edge ,",
    "@xmath20 while at the right edge , @xmath21 in summary , equations  ( [ eq : pendulum])([eq : edgeequation4 ] ) define our model for the dynamics of the ladder array .",
    "a useful mechanical analog for the system is a frustrated lattice of coupled , damped , nonlinear pendula driven by a constant torque applied at the edges",
    ".    an important restriction on the currents immediately follows from the presence of the edges . equations  ( [ eq : edgeequation1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : edgeequation2 ] ) imply that @xmath22 . moving successively from the left edge to the interior of the ladder , kirchhoff s current law yields @xmath23    this condition  ( [ eq : returnedges ] ) is automatically satisfied by any phase configuration whose evolution obeys the _ up - down symmetry _ @xmath24 as can be seen from  ( [ eq : pendulum ] ) .",
    "moreover , if the initial conditions satisfy @xmath25 along with similar equalities on the first time - derivatives , the governing equations imply that those equalities will hold for _ all _ time . in geometrical terms",
    ", the set of all up - down symmetric states  ( [ eq : phiupdown ] ) forms an invariant submanifold of the full phase space .    on the other hand , it is certainly possible to choose initial conditions that do not have this up - down symmetry . but our simulations indicate that for a wide range of parameters and initial conditions , arbitrary phase configurations rapidly evolve toward up - down symmetric states . in other words ,",
    "the invariant manifold is typically attracting in the transverse directions  initial states that are off the manifold are soon drawn onto it .",
    "there are also exceptions to this rule : as we will see in section  [ sec : bifurc ] , the single - vortex and fully - frustrated states can lose transverse stability as the frustration @xmath1 decreases .",
    "nevertheless , a great deal of insight can be obtained by restricting attention to the submanifold of up - down symmetric states .",
    "thus , for much of this paper we will assume that  ( [ eq : phiupdown ] ) holds , and we will replace @xmath26 with @xmath27 throughout the governing equations .    there is a simple condition for the transverse stability of an up - down symmetric fixed point .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that such a fixed point is linearly stable to perturbations that are _ strictly normal _ to the manifold if and only if @xmath28 we have checked numerically that in the instances when the up - down symmetry is broken ( and , thus , the system escapes the symmetric manifold ) , the subsequent evolution does in fact take place purely along the normal direction .",
    "therefore , any up - down symmetric fixed point that is stable must satisfy this inequality  ( [ eq : horizontalcond ] ) . hence  ( [ eq : horizontalcond ] ) constitutes a _ necessary _ condition for stability .",
    "( it is not sufficient , however , because it only governs the transverse direction ; it says nothing about the stability with respect to perturbations that preserve the symmetry .",
    "further conditions would be needed to ensure stability in directions _ along _ the invariant manifold as will be shown below . )    in summary , the governing equations can be written compactly as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , and with the components of @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 the dynamical evolution of the state @xmath33 of the system is obtained by numerically solving this system of coupled differential and algebraic equations .",
    "the dynamics also depend implicitly on the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 .    in experiments ,",
    "the most convenient way to probe the dynamics of the array is to measure its dc current - voltage ( @xmath35 ) characteristics . from the josephson relations  @xcite ,",
    "the time - dependent voltage across each junction is directly proportional to @xmath36 , the time - derivative of its phase .",
    "hence , the total dc voltage @xmath37 across the array in the vertical direction is proportional to the spatial _ and _ temporal average of all the phase derivatives .",
    "although because of this averaging a great deal of dynamical information is lost about the spatiotemporal state of the system , the @xmath35 curve still provides a useful ( if somewhat coarse ) indicator of changes in the underlying dynamics as the drive current @xmath0 is varied .",
    "in the case of ladder arrays , the @xmath35 curves display three regions associated with distinct dynamical behaviors  @xcite . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "the system is _ superconducting _ ( @xmath38 ) with pinned or slightly oscillating junctions ( in the mechanical analog , the pendula are at rest or librating slightly ) . at a depinning current @xmath39 , the array jumps to the _ flux - flow _ region , in which a finite voltage is produced by vortices of magnetic flux moving across the array . at still higher currents ,",
    "the dynamics is characterized by _ whirling modes _",
    "@xcite ( in the mechanical analog , all the pendula rotate over the top at a nearly uniform angular velocity proportional to the applied torque ) . in this state , there is a linear _ ohmic _ dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath0 . in the remainder of the article we focus on the superconducting states and the critical current @xmath39 at which depinning occurs .",
    "we have performed dynamical simulations of the array in which the current is ramped up from zero with different initial conditions .",
    "the superconducting solutions observed in those simulations are always static states , i.e. , fixed points of the system .",
    "( in principle , time - dependent solutions with high cancelling symmetry could also have zero total dc voltage , but we never see such states in our simulations . ) more specifically , for any given @xmath9 and @xmath5 , only three types of configurations appear in the numerics : _ no - vortex _ solutions ( figure  [ fig : scnovortex ] ) for @xmath1 smaller than @xmath40 , and solutions of the _ single - vortex _ type ( figure  [ fig : onevortex ] ) and _ fully - frustrated _ type ( figure  [ fig : schalfedge ] ) for @xmath41 . far from the edges , the no - vortex ( nv ) state",
    "is characterized by identical phases for all junctions .",
    "the same applies to the single - vortex ( sv ) configuration far from both the edges and the center of the vortex . on the other hand , the fully - frustrated ( ff ) state",
    "has a spatial oscillatory pattern with a wavelength equal to two plaquettes .",
    "all of these states are modified by noticeable edge effects .",
    "although there are many other static solutions of the system , our numerical simulations indicate that the no - vortex , single - vortex , and fully - frustrated states are the only ones needed to explain the depinning behavior of the array .    when dealing with _",
    "fixed points _ with up - down symmetry  ( [ eq : phiupdown ] ) the defining equations  ( [ eq : eq1])([eq : eq3 ] ) become @xmath42 where we have defined artificial phases @xmath43 .",
    "note that the mccumber parameter @xmath9 does not appear in the equations for the fixed points , and hence does not affect their existence .",
    "this is consistent with the numerically observed independence of the depinning behavior on @xmath9 .    in the rest of this section",
    "we obtain analytical approximations for the nv , sv , and ff configurations mentioned above .",
    "we follow a common scheme for all of them .",
    "first , we obtain a no - edge approximation ( denoted with a dagger @xmath44 ) for the infinite ladder .",
    "second , we introduce the effect of the edges perturbatively to obtain an edge - corrected approximation ( identified by a double dagger @xmath45 ) .",
    "the calculated configurations have been exhaustively compared with the results of numerical simulations with excellent agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : scnovortex ] ( a)(b ) shows a plot of the no - vortex solution , as computed numerically , along with the analytical approximation described below .",
    "this state is characterized by the absence of topological vortices ( @xmath46 ) and , far from the edges , by the constancy of the phases .    as a first approximation ,",
    "let @xmath47 denote the phases of the no - vortex solution for the _ infinite _ ladder , i.e. , in the absence of edge effects . to ease the notation ,",
    "let @xmath48 denote the common phase of the horizontal junctions ( so @xmath49 for all @xmath50 ) , and define @xmath51 similarly for the phases of the vertical junctions .",
    "the only physically acceptable solution of equations  ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) that also satisfies the stability condition  ( [ eq : horizontalcond ] ) is : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and all the angles are restricted to the first quadrant .",
    "this solution exists if and only if @xmath54 . a linear stability analysis shows that , for all @xmath55 , the solution is stable if @xmath56 . the other possible solutions with @xmath57 or @xmath58 are linearly unstable  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "when the edges are completely neglected , the array behaves like a single junction : its only stable no - vortex solution of the observed form  ( [ eq : scsolnoed ] ) disappears at @xmath59 through a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "this existence criterion will be used in section  [ sec : bifurc ] when discussing the stability properties of the nv solution .",
    "figure  [ fig : scnovortex ] shows that this infinite - ladder approximation works well near the center of the ladder , but breaks down close to the edges .",
    "we now take edge effects into account by considering an edge - corrected solution ( denoted by @xmath45 ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 denote the corrections . from the fixed point equations ( [ eq : scequation1 ] ) , ( [ eq : scequation2 ] ) , the @xmath62 must satisfy @xmath63 the corrections @xmath62 are expected to be small , except in a region very close to the edges .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : corrections1 ] ) can be expanded to first order in @xmath64 and @xmath65 to obtain a second - order difference equation for @xmath64 : @xmath66 from which the horizontal corrections are @xmath67    the general solution of  ( [ eq : difference ] ) is @xmath68 hence , the edges produce corrections that decay exponentially from both ends with a characteristic length @xmath69 . this @xmath70 is a measure of how small perturbations decay inside of a region with the no - vortex superconducting solution .",
    "a similar result was recently obtained by denniston and tang  @xcite using the transfer matrix method for the particular @xmath71 case .    to complete the solution , the constants @xmath72 in  ( [ eq : correctionvert ] ) have to be fixed from the boundary conditions @xmath73 which result from current conservation at nodes @xmath74 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "since @xmath62 become largest at the edges , equations  ( [ eq : scboundcond1])([eq : scboundcond2 ] ) are solved numerically _ without _ linearization . when the array is long enough , such that @xmath75 , the effect of one edge on the other is negligible and the solution is further simplified as equations  ( [ eq : scboundcond1])([eq : scboundcond2 ] ) decouple .",
    "then @xmath76 and @xmath77 are obtained independently by solving @xmath78    figure  [ fig : scnovortex ] ( a)(b ) shows that the above analytical solution agrees well with the results of simulations for long ( @xmath79 ) arrays .",
    "the approximation accounts well for the effect of the open ends also for short ( @xmath80 ) arrays ( not shown ) .",
    "the exponential decay of the perturbation from the edges is also checked satisfactorily in figure  [ fig : scnovortex](c ) .",
    "as expected on physical grounds , the edge effects become more important as both the field and the current are increased .",
    "thus , the approximation is best when @xmath1 and @xmath0 are small , and worsens as @xmath81 and @xmath41 ( @xmath82 is a singular limit , as seen from the vanishing denominator in  ( [ eq : scnvalpha ] ) ) .",
    "this establishes limits on the use of this approximation for the prediction of the depinning current at high values of the frustration .",
    "our analytical approximation also explains other features of the numerics .",
    "for instance , the corrections @xmath83 are spatially asymmetric with respect to the center of the array when @xmath84  as seen in figure  [ fig : scnovortex](a)(b ) by comparing the rightmost and leftmost phases .",
    "note also that for @xmath85 the largest vertical phase occurs at the right end of the ladder in obvious connection with the preferred direction for flux - propagation in the array ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "moreover , it can readily be shown that the change of the frustration from @xmath1 to @xmath87 has only one effect : the vertical phases for frustration @xmath87 are a mirror image , with respect to the center of the array , of the vertical phases with frustration @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the depinning current will be _ identical _ for both values of the frustration , as expected , but the direction of propagation is reversed  @xcite .",
    "an analytical approximation for the single - vortex configuration can be obtained in a similar fashion by realizing that the effect of a vortex located in cell @xmath88 of the array is similar to the edge effects in the no - vortex state .",
    "note how , if the phases in figure  [ fig : onevortex](a)(b ) were reduced to @xmath18 , the single - vortex configuration is composed of two halves , each of which is equivalent to a no - vortex superconducting solution when we move away from the edges and from the vortex center @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the zeroth order single - vortex solution @xmath89 is identical to the no - edge nv solution given in  ( [ eq : scsolnoed ] ) . and the edge and vortex - corrected approximation with a vortex distribution @xmath90 and @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 where the corrections @xmath61 result now both from the presence of the edges and of the vortex in plaquette @xmath88 .",
    "following the same steps as for the nv configuration , we obtain identical expressions  ( [ eq : corrections1])([eq : scnvr ] ) for the corrections for _ each _ half of the array : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is , once more , given by ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) . therefore , the single - vortex solution is obtained by _ matching _ two edge - corrected no - vortex solutions .",
    "in fact , the vortex in cell @xmath88 effectively introduces two new `` edges '' , at @xmath88 and @xmath95 , which also produce similar exponentially decaying corrections . the matching condition at @xmath88 and @xmath95",
    "is given by the fluxoid quantization condition in the cell containing the topological vortex : @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath97    this completes the equations needed to determine the unknowns @xmath98 in our solution  ( [ eq : aonevortex ] ) . they can be calculated numerically  @xcite , for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , from  ( [ eq : baonevortex ] ) and the boundary conditions from current conservation at nodes @xmath99 and @xmath6 .",
    "the approximation is compared with numerical simulations in figure  [ fig : onevortex ] with excellent agreement , especially at small @xmath1 .",
    "we also note that although the ladder equations  ( [ eq : scequation1])- ( [ eq : scequation2 ] ) can be reduced approximately to a discrete sine - gordon equation  @xcite , our analytical expression  ( [ eq : onevortex ] ) is a better approximation than the much - used sine - gordon kink , which is a good description in strictly 1-d parallel arrays  @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of both approaches is presented in appendix  [ sec : appsg ] .",
    "the other relevant superconducting state is the fully - frustrated solution , which appears in simulations when @xmath100 ( figure  [ fig : schalfedge ] ) . to obtain an analytical approximation",
    ", we follow once more the same scheme as above : first , calculate a no - edge basic solution ; then , introduce the edges perturbatively .    in this case",
    ", the basic solution is seen numerically to oscillate in space with a wavelength equal to two plaquettes .",
    "thus , when edges are neglected ( the infinite - ladder approximation ) , the phases can be approximated in general by @xmath101 \\\\",

    "the agreement is good except near the ends , as expected .",
    "the approximation above also yields an existence criterion for the no - edge fully - frustrated solution . in  ( [ eq : lhf ] )",
    ", the expression inside the square root must be non - negative ; hence the infinite - ladder fully - frustrated solution does not exist if @xmath111 where the subscript `` ff '' denotes fully - frustrated and `` th '' denotes a theoretical approximation of a bifurcation condition .",
    "we will use this condition  ( [ eq : currhalf ] ) later when we discuss the depinning of the fully - frustrated solution .",
    "this predicted form of the infinite - ladder fully - frustrated solution agrees with previous findings obtained for the special case when there is no driving current  @xcite . for @xmath71 ,",
    "our solution  ( [ eq : halfsolution])([eq : lhf ] ) reduces to the stable configuration  @xcite @xmath112 which coincides with the ground state for @xmath82 and @xmath71 calculated by benedict  @xcite .",
    "( to obtain this result from the expressions above , note that @xmath113 as @xmath114 , for the solution corresponding to the minus sign in ( [ eq : lhf ] ) . )",
    "we also note that the infinite - ladder fully - frustrated solution exists _ for all _ @xmath1 when @xmath71 , i.e. , there is no critical magnetic field below which it ceases to exist , although it is energetically most favorable when @xmath100 .",
    "the physical meaning of this solution is clear : it contains a topological vortex in every other cell , as seen from the alternating sequence of zeros and ones for the plaquette integers @xmath15 in the equations  ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , although the solutions with @xmath115 and @xmath116 are degenerate in an infinite array , they are not so if the array is finite .",
    "however , we will show in section  [ sec : bifurc ] that the depinning of the fully - frustrated state is basically unaffected by the parity of the number of cells in the ladder .    as we did for the no - vortex solution",
    ", we now introduce corrections from the edges . the improved solution @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 and there is an additional @xmath120 when @xmath5 is even and @xmath121 when @xmath5 is odd .",
    "the double cell is used to simplify the calculations , as suggested by the spatial periodicity of the infinite - ladder solution .    again , far away from the ends the corrections are small and we linearize the governing equations ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) around the basic solution ( [ eq : halfsolution ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain the following system of coupled difference equations : @xmath122 eliminating @xmath123 and @xmath124 we get a second - order difference equation for @xmath125 : @xmath126 with @xmath127 given by @xmath128}{\\sin^{2}\\pi f -cb^{2}}.\\ ] ] ( here @xmath129 and @xmath130 are shorthand for @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively ) .",
    "this difference equation has the general solution @xmath135 and @xmath136 is related again to another characteristic penetration depth for the perturbations from the edges to die off , this time inside a region with the fully - frustrated solution .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath76 have to be calculated numerically using the boundary conditions from nodes @xmath74 and @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath124 is also of the same form @xmath137 .",
    "note that in both equations , @xmath138 is the number that indexes the double cell .",
    "figure  [ fig : schalfedge ] ( c ) illustrates the accuracy of these approximate formulas .",
    "specifically , we plot the spatial dependence of the predicted deviations @xmath139 where @xmath140 is obtained from the numerical solution and @xmath141 is the infinite - ladder approximation .",
    "the expected exponential decay close to the edges with characteristic length @xmath142 is verified in the figure .",
    "in this section , we describe the depinning transitions as seen in dynamical simulations of the ladder array at zero temperature . in the following section",
    ", we will explain these dynamical results by relating them to the bifurcations of the no - vortex , single - vortex , and fully - frustrated superconducting solutions .",
    "the main goal is to give a rigorous mathematical explanation of the following observations : dynamical simulations show that the array is superconducting at low values of the driving current @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the array remains superconducting until a critical current @xmath143 is reached , after which the array depins and develops a non - zero average voltage .",
    "this depinning current @xmath39 decreases monotonically as the frustration @xmath1 increases from @xmath3 to @xmath144 .",
    "these numerical observations are all at the averaged level of the @xmath35 characteristics .",
    "they do not tell us anything about the detailed configuration of the individual junctions .",
    "in particular , there are several distinct superconducting states ( e.g. , the nv , sv , and ff states discussed in section  [ sec : analytical ] , and states containing multiple vortices ) but these are indistinguishable on the @xmath35 curve .",
    "this ambiguity raises the question : what is the state of the ladder just before it depins ?",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : bifurc ] that for most values of @xmath1 , the depinning of the ladder is caused by the destruction of the no - vortex state .",
    "specifically , the global depinning current @xmath143 can be predicted by calculating the current at which the no - vortex state is annihilated in a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the only exception occurs for values of @xmath1 close to @xmath144 , where the depinning is due to saddle - node bifurcations of states of the fully - frustrated type .",
    "the noteworthy point here is that no other superconducting states play a role in the global depinning of the array .",
    "however , the question arises as to how the depinning behavior would change when configurations with vortices are used as initial conditions ( rather than the random or zero - phase initial conditions that we ordinarily use in our simulations of the @xmath35 characteristics ) . to address this issue",
    ", we perform dynamical simulations from an initial condition with one @xmath145-step in the middle cell of the array : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this initial condition is _ not _ a solution of the system and , thus , under the dynamical equations ( [ eq : eq1])([eq : eq3 ] ) it relaxes onto a true solution for the ladder . for most @xmath148 , the _ single - vortex superconducting state _",
    "( top panel of figure  [ fig : lat ] ) is reached , i.e. , a static configuration with a topological vortex in cell @xmath88 of the array such that @xmath90 and @xmath149 . for some ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ,",
    "this configuration is not dynamically stable and other solutions are found , as discussed in section  [ sec : bifurc ] .",
    "the numerical observations shown in figure  [ fig : lat ] depict the dynamical behavior of the single - vortex state for most values of @xmath1 , i.e. approximately @xmath150 .",
    "they can be summarized as follows : for @xmath151 and small driving current @xmath0 , the system relaxes onto a static single - vortex solution with a vortex in the middle of the array .",
    "the solution is slightly distorted as the current is increased , until at @xmath152 the vortex moves from the center cell toward the left .",
    "( this current is analogous to the well - known lobb - abraham - tinkham ( lat ) depinning current for two - dimensional josephson junction arrays  @xcite ) . for currents very close to @xmath153 ,",
    "the vortex moves slowly and gets trapped in another cell somewhere between the center and the edge . for somewhat larger @xmath154 ,",
    "the vortex moves all the way to the left edge where it becomes pinned until , at a second critical current @xmath155 , it is expelled from the array and the no - vortex solution is recovered again .",
    "the no - vortex configuration then remains stable until , at @xmath39 , global depinning of the array occurs .",
    "if instead of placing the vortex in the middle , we locate it closest to the _ right _ edge , it depins at a current @xmath156 , and moves toward the center .",
    "these observations can be clarified with the usual analogy  @xcite of the vortex as a damped particle moving in a sinusoidal potential under the action of a @xmath157 lorentz - like force directly proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the maxima of the potential correspond to the vertical junctions and the minima are situated in the middle of the cells .",
    "thus , the initial barrier which has to be overcome to begin the motion explains the critical @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , the open boundaries can be thought to produce an exponentially - decaying envelope superimposed on the sinusoidal potential .",
    "thus the motion of the vortex is easier when the vortex is close to the right edge and becomes increasingly difficult as the left boundary is approached .",
    "when @xmath155 is reached , the vortex is able to overcome the edge barrier and is expelled from the array .",
    "then the no - vortex configuration is recovered and no new vortex enters the ladder .",
    "we mentioned before that the described behavior is observed for values of the frustration contained between two limiting values .",
    "first , there is a minimum frustration @xmath158 below which the single - vortex solution never ensues from this initial condition ; in fact , the system settles on the no - vortex superconducting solution .",
    "second , for @xmath1 larger than @xmath159 , the vortex is _ not _ expelled from the array at the left edge before depinning .",
    "depinning occurs in that case when vortices enter the array from the right edge .",
    "these observations will be clarified in section  [ sec : bifurc ] .",
    "we have also performed dynamical simulations for the multi - vortex case and reached similar conclusions for most values of @xmath1 . in that case , the initial condition consists of @xmath160 equally spaced @xmath145-steps which are then allowed to evolve dynamically . for @xmath71 and large enough @xmath1 , the initial condition relaxes onto the expected solution with @xmath160 vortices in the array . as the current",
    "is increased , these move towards the left end where they accumulate until they are expelled one by one at different currents .",
    "after this , the no - vortex solution is again recovered .    on the other hand ,",
    "the picture changes when @xmath1 is close to @xmath144 .",
    "there , solutions of the fully - frustrated type are obtained from the multi - vortex initial condition and there is no expulsion of vortices from the ladder . instead , the array depins globally at the current where the ff solution ceases to exist , i.e. @xmath161 .",
    "we conclude that in the ladder , the depinning of one vortex ( or a train of vortices ) is _ not _ equivalent to the global edge - dominated depinning of the device . as we will confirm in section  [ sec : bifurc ] , the no - vortex and fully - frustrated states are the relevant solutions for the depinning of the array ; for moderate @xmath1 , even if the initial conditions contain vortices , these are expelled from the array as the current is increased and , eventually , the no - vortex solution is recovered . for @xmath1 close to @xmath144 , the system settles onto fully - frustrated solutions with distinct depinning properties .",
    "we have also identified three other critical currents related to the single - vortex configuration : @xmath162 , at which a vortex at the right edge begins to move ; @xmath153 , at which dynamical depinning occurs for a single vortex centered in the middle of the ladder ; and @xmath155 , at which the vortex is expelled at the edge .",
    "all of these dynamical observations are explained in detail in the next section where they are compared to their exact mathematical descriptions .",
    "in this section , we use bifurcation theory to obtain exact criteria for all the critical currents of the no - vortex , single - vortex , and fully - frustrated states .",
    "we have checked consistently that these bifurcations explain the dynamical depinning behavior of the array as described in section  [ sec : depinning ] .",
    "furthermore , analytical simplifications to some of those criteria will be deduced from approximations of the exact depinning results .",
    "the depinning of the ladder can be explained in dynamical terms as follows : the linear stability of the superconducting states of the ladder as a function of @xmath0 can be deduced from the jacobian matrix @xmath163 of the dynamical system  ( [ eq : eq1])([eq : eq3 ] ) for a given value of @xmath1 , and for a given fixed point  in particular , the no - vortex , single - vortex or fully - frustrated state . if all the eigenvalues have negative real parts , the fixed point is linearly stable .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 , some of the eigenvalues move to the right in the complex plane , and the fixed point becomes less stable .",
    "the critical current for a given fixed point is defined by the condition that the maximum of the real parts of the eigenvalues becomes positive .",
    "then , to predict the _ global _ depinning current , we compare the critical currents of the different superconducting states , and take the maximum of those .",
    "in other words , we predict that global depinning occurs when the `` last '' stable state bifurcates .",
    "recall that there are several scenarios  @xcite by which a stable fixed point can undergo such a bifurcation .",
    "first , in a zero - eigenvalue bifurcation , a single eigenvalue moves along the real axis , and passes from negative to positive at the bifurcation .",
    "there are three main subtypes of zero - eigenvalue bifurcation : saddle - node , transcritical , and pitchfork . in the saddle - node bifurcation",
    ", a stable fixed point collides with a saddle point , and both are annihilated .",
    "in contrast , in the transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations , the stable fixed point is not destroyed  it continues to exist but goes unstable .",
    "a second scenario is provided by the hopf bifurcation which involves a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues passing through the imaginary axis from the left half plane to the right half plane ",
    "again this bifurcation destabilizes the fixed point , but does not destroy it .",
    "since it can be shown that hopf bifurcations are not possible in this system  @xcite , we can simplify our calculations by using the _ static _ system  ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) to identify the location of the zero - eigenvalue bifurcations .",
    "those bifurcation points are characterized by a change in the number of fixed points and , thus , from the implicit function theorem  @xcite , the jacobian matrix @xmath164 of the static system has zero determinant there .",
    "hence , we use the superconducting ( static ) up - down symmetric system given by @xmath165 , @xmath166 with @xmath167 . for a given @xmath1 and a given superconducting state ,",
    "we compute the bifurcating fixed point @xmath168 and its associated critical current @xmath169 at which @xmath170 . to this end",
    ", we define an augmented algebraic system with the current @xmath0 as an extra variable , and the constraint on the determinant as an extra equation .",
    "then @xmath168 and @xmath171 are obtained by solving @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174\\}. \\label{eq : augmented2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : depinning ] shows that the dynamical depinning of the ladder is explained by @xmath171 ( zero - eigenvalue ) bifurcations .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to analyzing the bifurcations of the no - vortex , single - vortex and fully - frustrated configurations .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we follow a parallel scheme for all of them and keep the notation consistent . for each of the states , we first calculate numerically the zero - eigenvalue bifurcations from  ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) ( always denoted with a star @xmath175 ) and compare them with the depinning currents from _ dynamical _ simulations ( always denoted with symbols in the figures ) . then",
    ", when possible , we deduce analytical simplifications of these criteria in one of two ways : ( a ) by deducing that the instability is essentially caused by a bifurcation of the no - edge solution , or ( b ) by explaining the instability as edge - originated and , thus , localized at the boundaries .",
    "these theoretical analytical approximations are always denoted with the subscript `` th '' .",
    "moreover , to emphasize the importance of the edges in the depinning transitions , we calculate the depinning of the no - edge solutions for all three configurations . finally , note that no energy arguments are invoked in this discussion .",
    "thermodynamic considerations are studied in detail in section  [ sec : conclusion ] where phase diagrams of these superconducting states for the no - edge and finite ladders are presented .",
    "figure  [ fig : depinning ] shows that for most values of @xmath1 , the depinning current @xmath143 ( obtained from dynamical simulations ) coincides with the critical current @xmath176 for the no - vortex state calculated from the augmented system  ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find that the bifurcating phase configuration @xmath177 matches the depinning configuration @xmath178 observed in dynamical simulations .",
    "hence , the bifurcation of the no - vortex state constitutes an exact criterion for the global depinning current , except for values of @xmath1 close to @xmath144 , where the global depinning is caused by the destruction of the fully - frustrated solution , as explained below .    to gain intuition about how to derive analytical approximations for @xmath143 , it is helpful to characterize the depinning bifurcation more precisely .",
    "our numerical computations indicate that the depinning of the no - vortex state is due to a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "as @xmath0 approaches @xmath176 from below , the stable no - vortex state approaches an unstable no - vortex state , and coalesces with it when @xmath179 , causing both states to disappear .",
    "figure  [ fig : sadnodnv](a ) shows the maximum _ dynamical _ eigenvalue for both the stable and unstable states  note that both of these eigenvalues are pure real , and they equal 0 at the critical current . as expected , this plot has the standard shape of a saddle - node bifurcation diagram  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sadnodnv](b)(c ) plots the phase configuration for both states at @xmath71 .",
    "they have similar spatial structure , except near the rightmost cell , where ( in the language of the mechanical analog ) the unstable state has an inverted pendulum .",
    "incidentally , figure  [ fig : sadnodnv ] also shows that both states satisfy the up - down symmetry @xmath180 discussed in section  [ sec : system ] .",
    "numerical simulations show that this symmetry continues to hold for all values of @xmath0 on both the stable and unstable branches .",
    "thus , the global depinning bifurcation takes place entirely within the invariant manifold of up - down symmetric states ",
    "it is _ not _ a symmetry - breaking bifurcation .",
    "the conclusion that the depinning transition for most values of @xmath1 corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation of the no - vortex superconducting state can be simplified further .",
    "we now obtain analytical approximations for @xmath181 using the approximate solutions calculated in section  [ sec : analytical ] .",
    "we recall that the bifurcation of the infinite - ladder no - vortex configuration does not explain the observed @xmath1-dependence of the finite - ladder nv depinning . as discussed in section  [ sec : analytical ] , if the edges are neglected completely , the no - vortex solution  ( [ eq : scnvedge])([eq : correctionvert ] ) is predicted to exist and be stable for all @xmath182 , independent of the frustration @xmath1 , in analogy with the single junction .",
    "thus , the depinning for the no - edge nv state occurs through a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath183 .    to capture the observed @xmath1-dependence of the critical current @xmath176",
    ", we need a more careful approximation .",
    "we now present two such approximations to @xmath176 that clarify the physical picture of the transition .",
    "the first strategy is to use the improved approximation  ( [ eq : scnvedge ] ) for the no - vortex state ( in which the edge effects are included perturbatively ) , and then write down a _ simplified augmented system _",
    "@xmath184 for this solution , similar to the expression  ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) for the full @xmath185-dimensional system .",
    "we can then calculate the critical current @xmath186 for this reduced model , defined as the value of @xmath0 where the _ perturbative _ solution undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "this renders the calculation analytically tractable since , for a given @xmath1 , only three variables @xmath187 suffice to describe the perturbative solution ( [ eq : scnvedge])instead of @xmath0 and @xmath188 phases for the full solution .",
    "the simplified augmented system is constituted by ( [ eq : scnvleft ] ) , ( [ eq : scnvright ] ) together with the condition that the determinant of the @xmath189 jacobian matrix equals zero , corresponding to the zero - eigenvalue condition at a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "furthermore , since equations ( [ eq : scnvleft ] ) and ( [ eq : scnvright ] ) are uncoupled when @xmath5 is not very small , even this three - dimensional system can be further reduced to a two - dimensional system with unknowns @xmath77 and @xmath0 : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is given by ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) .",
    "note that this is a set of _ local _ equations referred to the rightmost end of the array .",
    "we numerically solve the @xmath189 reduced system @xmath192 to obtain the approximate depinning current @xmath193 and the value of the rightmost phase @xmath194 at the bifurcation .",
    "figure  [ fig : depanalyt ] shows that @xmath193 predicts the exact @xmath195 reasonably well . as expected , the prediction gets worse as @xmath1 nears @xmath144 since the perturbative approximation of the no - vortex solution is less accurate in that limit .",
    "both the analyses of the eigenfunctions of the full @xmath196 system  ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) and of the reduced system  ( [ eq : reduced1])([eq : reduced2 ] ) indicate that the global depinning of the ladder is caused by a local instability of the rightmost junction of the array .",
    "this is consistent with physical arguments which imply that after depinning occurs , vortices propagate in the array in the @xmath197 direction under the effect of a magnetic magnus ( lorentz - like ) force .",
    "the key role played by the rightmost junction suggests a second simplification , which we call a heuristic criterion for depinning .",
    "this criterion connects the global depinning of the ladder with the much simpler depinning transition in a single junction .",
    "recall that when the phase of a single junction reaches @xmath198 , its superconducting solution is destroyed in a saddle - node bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we intuitively propose that when the phase of the rightmost junction reaches @xmath198 , the ladder depins .",
    "replacing the no - vortex solution by its perturbative approximation ( [ eq : scnvedge ] ) , we solve for the current @xmath199 by imposing @xmath200 which implies @xmath201 then , from ( [ eq : scnvright ] ) , we obtain an implicit transcendental equation for @xmath202 : @xmath203 with @xmath204 given by ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) .",
    "this simple analytical prediction is shown to be in very good agreement with the exact results in figure  [ fig : depanalyt ] .",
    "the techniques described in this section can be extended to include the effect of self - fields . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixa ] we illustrate this approach and show how self - inductance modifies the approximate no - vortex solution and the corresponding depinning current .",
    "we begin the study of the stability of the single - vortex ( sv ) configuration by considering the single - vortex far from the edges .",
    "the results obtained for the vortex in the center will be used subsequently to describe the effects of the edges on the sv state .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : depinning ] , a vortex in the center of the array moves to the left over the potential barrier when the critical current @xmath153 is reached .",
    "we show now that this depinning of the vortex corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation of the single - vortex solution . to verify this ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the single - vortex solutions that are centered in the middle of the ladder ; then we look for the current @xmath205 at which the determinant of the static jacobian matrix @xmath206 . as in ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) , we solve the augmented system @xmath207 to find where the centered single - vortex state ceases to exist .",
    "figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] shows the perfect agreement between the @xmath208 computed from the static augmented system and the @xmath209 obtained from simulations where a vortex is placed in the middle of the array and the current is increased until it moves , i.e. , @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig : sadnodsv ] confirms that this depinning transition is indeed caused by a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "an unstable single - vortex state collides with and annihilates the stable single - vortex state at the transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : sadnodsv ] shows that the two states have similar spatial structure the difference is that the stable state has its vortex in the center of a cell ( where the vortex sits in a potential well ) , while the unstable state has its vortex on a junction ( poised on a potential hill ) .",
    "although conceptually similar , our @xmath153 for the ladder is not equivalent to that calculated by lobb - abraham - tinkham  @xcite .",
    "their current is estimated by a static calculation of the energy barrier @xmath211 in an infinitely extended two - dimensional array , while ours is the dynamic current at which the centered single - vortex state undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation in the quasi - one - dimensional ladder . moreover",
    ", their static calculation does not include the effects of the field @xmath1 or the injected current @xmath0 on the solutions while , in our case , they are implicitly taken into account since the configurations  and therefore their stability  depend parametrically on @xmath212 .",
    "we noted above the numerical observation  @xcite that , when performing dynamical simulations , the static single - vortex solution is unstable below a _ critical field _",
    "we show now that this is the result of a symmetry - breaking instability which is mathematically related to another zero - eigenvalue bifurcation . therefore , once again , the dynamical @xmath4 coincides with a static @xmath214 calculated from the augmented system  ( [ eq : augmented1])([eq : augmented2 ] ) as the value of @xmath1 where the determinant of the static jacobian matrix * j * is zero and , thus , a change in the number of fixed points is likely .",
    "excellent agreement between @xmath4 and @xmath214 is shown in figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : pitchforksv ] depicts detailed information about this bifurcation .",
    "specifically , it shows three single - vortex states that co - exist for @xmath1 slightly greater than @xmath214 .",
    "these states appear very similar , but on close inspection , one notices that two of the states are asymmetric : @xmath215 ( this is especially clear for the central plaquette @xmath216 . ) . as @xmath217 from above , these asymmetric states  which are unstable  simultaneously collide with the stable symmetric state , rendering it unstable . to visualize this transition in greater detail , figure  [ fig : pitchforksv ] plots the asymmetry for the central plaquette , @xmath218 , as a function of the frustration @xmath1 .",
    "the symmetric state exists both above and below the bifurcation , and satisfies @xmath219 throughout .",
    "the two unstable branches join the symmetric branch at @xmath220 .",
    "the scenario depicted in figure  [ fig : pitchforksv ] , common in symmetric systems , is known as a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation  @xcite .    from this",
    ", we conclude that there exists a region of the @xmath221 plane ( figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] ) where the single - vortex configuration exists but is always dynamically unstable . in this region , the vortex ( magnetic flux )",
    "is expelled _ transversally _ from the array through transient modes which do _ not _ preserve the up - down symmetry of the horizontal phases .",
    "we can also derive an analytical expression @xmath222 for the critical field @xmath214 .",
    "as given in  ( [ eq : horizontalcond ] ) , all up - down symmetric fixed points become unstable when the phase of any of the horizontal junctions is larger than @xmath198 in absolute value . since this largest phase occurs at the central plaquette ( as seen in figure  [ fig : pitchforksv ] ) , the following stability criterion ensues from the condition @xmath223 : @xmath224 = \\pi,\\ ] ] where we have used  ( [ eq : onevortex ] ) and ( [ eq : baonevortex ] ) and we consider a long array such that the effect of the edges on the middle cell can be neglected . here",
    "@xmath225 have to be calculated from the boundary conditions ( current conservation ) at nodes @xmath88 and @xmath95 : @xmath226 with @xmath94 given by  ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) .",
    "numerical solution of the critical condition  ( [ eq : stabhorizontal ] ) yields the curve @xmath227 which is almost indistinguishable from the curve for @xmath214 from the full augmented system ( figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] ) .",
    "it is especially interesting to check the case @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath228 and the critical condition  ( [ eq : stabhorizontal])([eq : boundhorizontal ] ) simplifies to @xmath229 = \\cos ( \\pi f_{\\rm sv , th}^{o } ) -1,\\ ] ] which can be solved numerically to give @xmath230 , in agreement with numerical findings from previous dynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "so far we have concentrated on a particular single - vortex state , namely one where the vortex occurs in the middle cell of the array .",
    "but there are many other single - vortex states , each differing from the previous one by displacing the vortex by one cell to the right or to the left .",
    "each of those configurations becomes unstable through bifurcations similar to those discussed above for the case of the centered single - vortex state .",
    "for most values of @xmath1 , as discussed in section  [ sec : depinning ] , when the driving current @xmath0 is increased , a vortex in the ladder moves to the left ( getting pinned in cells closer to the left edge as @xmath0 grows ) until it is expelled from the array at the left boundary .",
    "thus , in explaining the effect of the edges on the sv solution we are most interested in two critical currents : the critical current @xmath162 , at which a vortex at the right edge begins to move , and the critical current @xmath155 , at which the vortex is expelled at the left edge of the ladder .",
    "to predict @xmath162 , we analyze the sv configuration with the vortex placed in the rightmost cell ( the @xmath231 configuration ) .",
    "the results of the analysis are similar to those for the vortex in the center .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : svedge](a ) , this state can cease to exist through a saddle - node bifurcation ( @xmath232 ) , or become unstable through a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the agreement with the dynamical simulations is excellent .",
    "the rigorous explanation of @xmath155 turns out to be slightly more complicated .",
    "a careful examination of the numerics reveals that , depending on the value of @xmath1 , the vortex can be expelled from the array in one of two ways : from the leftmost cell ( cell number 1 ) as expected , or directly from cell number 2 .",
    "thus , we need to examine the dynamical stability of two sv states : the one with the vortex in cell 1 ( @xmath234 ) and in cell 2 ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "the dynamic stability of the @xmath235 configuration contains no new elements .",
    "the two observed bifurcations ( a saddle - node @xmath236 and a subcritical pitchfork @xmath237 ) are similar to those explained above .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : svedge](b ) where the saddle - node bifurcation is seen to explain the dynamical @xmath155 for @xmath238 .    however , it is the stability analysis of the @xmath234 state that explains the expulsion of the vortex at the edge for @xmath239 . as shown in figure  [",
    "fig : svedge](c ) , this configuration presents the usual saddle - node ( @xmath240 ) bifurcation .",
    "the pitchfork ( @xmath241 ) bifurcation is barely visible in the figure .",
    "there is also another saddle - node bifurcation at low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 which is irrelevant for the depinning considered here .",
    "the results of this section are summarized in figure  [ fig : svedge](d ) , which indicates the region where _ at least one _ single - vortex configuration in a ladder array _ with edges _ is dynamically stable .",
    "figure  [ fig : svedge](d ) is , in essence , the union of figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] with figure  [ fig : svedge](a)(c ) and shows how the sv solutions either cease to exist through a saddle - node bifurcation when @xmath0 is increased for most values of the frustration @xmath1 , or become unstable through a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation for small values of @xmath1 .    within this picture , the dynamical behavior in figure  [ fig : depinvortex ] , where the vortex propagates along the ladder in the interval @xmath242 , is the result of a succession of saddle - node bifurcations of single - vortex states situated in contiguous cells until the vortex is expelled at the left edge .",
    "this is in contrast with the symmetry - breaking exit of the vortex for @xmath243 where the flux is expelled in the transversal direction .",
    "this description is valid for @xmath244 .",
    "however , a subtle variation is observed beyond that point for the sv solutions .",
    "the comparison of figure  [ fig : svedge](c ) and figure  [ fig : depanalyt ] shows that the depinning of the sv and nv states is similar for high @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath245 , for @xmath246 .",
    "this is due to the fact that at high @xmath1 the vortex is _ not _ expelled from the array before depinning .",
    "instead , the sv configuration with the vortex at the left edge ceases to exist through a saddle - node bifurcation which , similarly to what happens to the nv state , is localized on the _ right _ edge of the ladder . the depinning transition of the single - vortex state at high f can be described in a similar fashion as the depinning of the no - vortex configuration : by the nucleation of vortices on the right edge of the ladder .",
    "thus , the single - vortex configuration plays no role in the global depinning of the array : only the behavior of the nv and ff states has to be considered .",
    "the depinning of the ladder array as @xmath41 is determined by the stability of the fully - frustrated configuration .",
    "this can be readily seen by inspection of figure  [ fig : depinning ] which shows that at high @xmath1 the depinning of the no - vortex state occurs _ before _ the global depinning of the array .    to clarify the importance of these transitions",
    "we follow the same scheme as above .",
    "we first calculate the zero - eigenvalue bifurcations of this state and show that the depinning of the ladder at @xmath247 is indeed explained by a saddle - node bifurcation of the ff state .",
    "then we obtain analytical approximations ( `` th '' ) to the exact bifurcations , using stability criteria for the infinite - ladder ff configuration .    in principle",
    ", the characterization of the ff bifurcations is more intricate than for the nv and sv configurations above since in the _ finite _ ladder several states of the ff type could play a role in the depinning .",
    "first , there exist different states in ladders with odd and even number of cells , as seen when the @xmath248 alternating vortex pattern is fitted into a finite length .",
    "second , there are many ff - states very close energetically with different dynamic stability structure .",
    "however , we will show that the landscape of relevant solutions is indeed clear , and depinning can be assigned to instabilities of _ one _ of those configurations .",
    "consider first an _ even _ ladder with ten plaquettes as an example .",
    "of the several states of the ff type , three can be thought as relevant : ( 1a ) @xmath249 , ( 1b ) @xmath250 , and ( 1c ) @xmath251 .",
    "we have analyzed the stability of these three states and conclude that only configuration ( 1a ) is relevant for depinning of the even ladder .",
    "both ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) cease to exist or become unstable at lower critical currents .",
    "this is physically reasonable since ( 1b ) will tend to move one cell to the left under the action of a driving current to produce ( 1a ) , while ( 1c ) ceases to exist through a low current saddle - node bifurcation caused by the expulsion of the vortex at the left boundary .",
    "the case of the _ odd _ ladder with @xmath5 plaquettes has one further complication , namely that we can not have exactly @xmath252 vortices in the array .",
    "thus , the `` pure '' ff state ( as calculated for the infinite case ) is not possible under these topological constraints .",
    "however , states similar to the `` pure '' ff are those which contain @xmath253 and @xmath254 vortices .",
    "take , for instance , a ladder with eleven plaquettes .",
    "we have then two groups of states : those with @xmath255 vortices , ( 2a ) @xmath256 , ( 2b ) @xmath257 , and ( 2c ) @xmath258 ; and those with @xmath259 vortices , ( 3a ) @xmath260 , ( 3b ) @xmath261 , and ( 3c ) @xmath262 .",
    "the detailed analysis of these states shows that ( 3a ) has the highest critical transition and is thus responsible for the depinning of the odd ladder .    there is a final important observation in our argument : the stability diagrams of the configurations which cause the depinning in odd and even ladders (3a ) and ( 1a ) respectively are _",
    "indistinguishable_. ( this is also true for other odd - even related configurations like ( 2b ) and ( 1c ) . ) the conclusion is then clear : the depinning behavior of odd and even ladders at high @xmath1 is identical as it can be explained by the bifurcation of configurations ( 1a ) and ( 3a ) which are of the @xmath263 type .",
    "the zero - eigenvalue bifurcations of these configurations are presented in figure  [ fig : depff ] .",
    "the bifurcations are of two types ( similar to those obtained for the sv state ) : saddle - node ( @xmath264 ) and pitchfork ( @xmath265 ) .",
    "note also how the saddle - node bifurcation corresponds to two distinct dynamical instabilities : for @xmath266 , the instability is spatially extended , while for @xmath267 , the instability is localized at the _",
    "right _ edge . only the former ( spatially extended )",
    "saddle - node bifurcation has any relevance for the global depinning of the array  as reflected by the agreement between @xmath39 and @xmath264 for @xmath268 .",
    "( of course , for @xmath269 , the depinning current and @xmath264 no longer coincide , because the depinning is caused there by a saddle - node bifurcation of a different state , the no - vortex solution , as shown earlier . )",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation @xmath265 is also spatially extended and , as observed for the single vortex , it implies the breaking of the up - down symmetry in the ff state .",
    "thus , the flux is expelled in the transversal direction .",
    "we clarify this in the following by calculating some analytical approximations to these criteria .",
    "the rigorous analysis above indicates that two of the bifurcating mechanisms imply spatially extended perturbations which are not localized at the edges .",
    "hence , we turn to instabilities of the infinite - ladder fully - frustrated solution to obtain analytical approximations .    one of the criteria was already established in section  [ sec : analytical ] where we showed that the no - edge ff solution ceases to exist at a current @xmath270 given by  ( [ eq : currhalf ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find excellent numerical agreement between the analytical @xmath271 and the numerical @xmath264 for @xmath272 ( figure  [ fig : depff ] ) .",
    "for instance , the predicted @xmath273 is very close to the dynamically computed @xmath274 .    to explain the observed pitchfork bifurcation , recall that the up - down symmetric manifold of solutions becomes unstable to normal perturbations when the absolute value of the horizontal phases is larger than @xmath198 , as given in  ( [ eq : horizontalcond ] ) .",
    "thus , from  ( [ eq : halfsolution])([eq : lhf ] ) and the critical condition @xmath275 we obtain the following implicit equation for the instability boundary @xmath276 : @xmath277 which is shown in figure  [ fig : depff ] and compared to the exact @xmath265 with excellent agreement . as an example , it is easy to show analytically that the value of this critical field when @xmath71 is given by @xmath278 = 0.2148.\\ ] ]    in summary , we can explain in part the stability diagram of the ff state in the presence of edges with two bifurcations of the infinitely extended ( no - edge ) ff solution : the saddle - node bifurcation @xmath270 , and the subcritical pitchfork @xmath279 .",
    "however , for the finite ladder , another saddle - node bifurcation is reached before @xmath271 for @xmath280 as seen in figure  [ fig : depff ] .",
    "numerical analysis shows that this bifurcation is local and it corresponds to an instability in the _ leftmost _ cell .",
    "it can be approximated heuristically by a criterion similar to ( [ eq : heurcrit ] ) for the nv state , i.e. for this interval of the frustration the ff state depins approximately when the leftmost junction becomes unstable .",
    "the first conclusion of our analysis is that for most values of @xmath1 , the global depinning current of the array @xmath143 coincides with the current @xmath176 where the no - vortex state undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation ( figure  [ fig : depinning ] ) .",
    "this bifurcation point can be well approximated by an analytical @xmath199 , given in  ( [ eq : heuristic ] ) , derived from an instability criterion for the rightmost junction of the array . for values of @xmath1 close to @xmath144 , however , the global depinning is caused by a saddle - node bifurcation of the fully - frustrated solution at a current @xmath281 .",
    "this bifurcation itself is well approximated by the global instability of the no - edge ff state at @xmath271 , as given analytically in equation  ( [ eq : currhalf ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that the depinning of the single vortex and its subsequent motion in the @xmath157 direction ( figure  [ fig : lat ] ) is the result of a cascade of saddle - node bifurcations of the single - vortex solution such that , for most values of @xmath1 , the fluxoids are expelled from the ladder through its left edge .",
    "more surprisingly , for smaller @xmath1 the sv and ff configurations can also undergo another transition : a symmetry - breaking subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in which the up - down symmetry of the horizontal phases plays a crucial role . in this case",
    ", the fluxoids are expelled in the transversal ( @xmath282 ) direction through the horizontal junctions .    at a finer level of description , the approximations obtained in section  [ sec : analytical ] for the nv , ff and sv states all have a common feature : the corrections due to the existence of edges , or of topological vortices in the array , decay exponentially in space with a characteristic length dependent on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as seen in  ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) for instance .",
    "thus , the effect of the perturbations can usually be captured by a local analysis .",
    "this explains why , besides their independence from the purely dynamical parameter @xmath9 , the depinning observables are largely independent of @xmath5 , the length of the array .",
    "we have summarized our results in a zero - temperature stability diagram ( figure  [ fig : phasediagedge ] ) where we present the different critical currents for the nv , sv , and ff superconducting solutions for the _ finite _ ladder ( with edges ) . in short ,",
    "the array ceases to be superconducting ( depins globally ) at @xmath39 when either the no - vortex , single - vortex or fully - frustrated solutions ceases to exist through saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the presence of vortices in the array does not change the observed depinning .",
    "if @xmath283 , the single - vortex solution is always unstable . for @xmath284 , a vortex in the array will depin at @xmath285 and",
    "will be expelled at the left edge at @xmath286 . at that point",
    "the no - vortex solution is recovered .",
    "this behavior is the same for multivortex solutions with moderate @xmath1 . for @xmath246 ,",
    "the single - vortex is not expelled at the left edge before depinning but its instability is almost identical to that of the no - vortex configuration since vortices enter from the right edge .",
    "note that no energy criteria have been invoked above .",
    "the calculation of energy boundaries for the relevant states remains open for further investigation .    to highlight the effect of the edges and to include energetic considerations we explore in more detail the phase diagram for the infinite ladder ( no edges ) , which we present in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "( this should be compared to the phase diagram of the ladder with edges in figure  [ fig : phasediagedge ] . )",
    "when no edges are present , the dynamic bifurcation boundaries for the three states are given by @xmath287 , @xmath271 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 .",
    "these dynamic criteria do not contradict previous thermodynamic studies of the infinite ladder  @xcite with @xmath71 where the no - vortex solution was calculated to be energetically stable only for frustrations smaller than a thermodynamic critical field @xmath291 , above which the flux penetrates the ladder .",
    "we have extended these calculations for the _ driven _ infinite ladder and the three superconducting solutions addressed in this article . defining the energy of a given configuration as @xmath292 we have calculated the energy boundaries for the approximate no - edge no - vortex , fully - frustrated and single - vortex solutions : @xmath293 , @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "the results of these _ thermodynamic _ calculations are also presented in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "note , for instance , that our calculated @xmath296 agrees well with other estimates  @xcite @xmath297 .",
    "moreover , our approximate solutions produce some new analytical results .",
    "for example , a closed expression for the energy boundary between the no - vortex and fully - frustrated solutions @xmath298 can be obtained as : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is given by  ( [ eq : lhf ] ) with the negative sign .",
    "for the special case @xmath71 , and using the limit @xmath113 , it can be shown analytically that this boundary crosses the @xmath71 axis at @xmath301 .",
    "we emphasize also that the regions in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] present distinct dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities .",
    "for instance , in some of them , the single - vortex solution is not the ground state of the system , although it is _ dynamically _ stable ( metastable ) .",
    "when comparing our results with those found in earlier work , one should carefully note the direction of injection of the driving current @xmath0 .",
    "previous analytical studies  @xcite have focused on the @xmath71 case and considered the effect of a small _ parallel _ current in the @xmath302 direction . in contrast , here @xmath0 is injected in the _ perpendicular _ ( @xmath303 ) direction .",
    "the depinning depends on the direction of current injection , a factor to be taken into account when explaining recent numerical simulations of ladder arrays  @xcite . in those simulations , marked differences between the depinning current of a circular ladder with _",
    "perpendicular _ injection , and of an open - ended ladder with _",
    "parallel _ injection were reported .",
    "although we have not studied the ring ladder in this paper , it is closely connected to the infinite ( no - edge ) ladder .",
    "the solutions for the infinite ladder constitute a sub - manifold of the solutions for the ring ladder ( i.e. , the topological constraints are more strict on the infinite ladder than in the ring ladder ) . to understand this , note first that the governing equations  ( [ eq : eq1])([eq : eq3 ] ) are the same for both ring and infinite ladders .",
    "on the other hand , following the same reasoning given by the sequence of equations  ( [ eq : interiorequation1])([eq : returnedges ] ) , we conclude that the topological constraints in the ring ladder imply only that @xmath304 where @xmath305 is a constant .",
    "therefore , from  ( [ eq : returnedges ] ) , the infinite ladder is mathematically equivalent to the particular case of the ring with @xmath306 , in which the concentric currents through the horizontal junctions in the outer @xmath307 and inner @xmath308 circles are equal and opposite .",
    "consequently , the results for the infinite ladder summarized in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] are also valid for the ring ladder if we restrict to the submanifold with @xmath306 . in this case",
    ", the phase diagram has to be reinterpreted in terms of the new topological constraints .",
    "first , the depinning of the no - vortex solution is unchanged : @xmath287 is still constant and equal to @xmath74 .",
    "however , the two bifurcations of the single - vortex configurations have new dynamical meaning .",
    "if the sv state goes unstable through the saddle - node bifurcation @xmath309 , flux can not be expelled through the horizontal junctions and the vortex depins and moves along the ladder circularly .",
    "thus , the ring ladder depins effectively at @xmath310 .",
    "however , if @xmath311 , the flux can be expelled _ transversally _ from the ladder through the horizontal junctions and the no - vortex state is recovered .",
    "then , the depinning occurs at @xmath312 .",
    "this is exactly the behavior reported from numerical simulations by hwang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . first , their isotropic @xmath313 coincides with our calculated @xmath309 .",
    "second , they found a critical field @xmath314 below which the depinning current is @xmath315 with exclusion of field inside the array .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath214 , the frustration below which the single - vortex configuration becomes dynamically unstable through a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation , which can be approximated analytically by @xmath227 , as given in  ( [ eq : stabhorizontal ] ) .",
    "( in the absence of driving , the analytical prediction  ( [ eq : crithorizontal ] ) gives @xmath316 , in perfect agreement with their numerical simulations  @xcite . )",
    "we note in passing that the same behavior should be expected for the fully - frustrated state in the ring ladder .",
    "the checkerboard pattern would begin to slide along the ring at @xmath271 producing a finite voltage .",
    "however , if the @xmath288 is crossed , the flux can be expelled transversally and the nv state would appear .",
    "these predictions would have to be checked numerically .    as a final remark",
    ", we also note that the second device considered by hwang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite  an open - ended ladder with _ parallel _",
    "current injection  cannot be compared directly with our ladder with _",
    "perpendicular _ injection .",
    "however , the depinning current @xmath317 follows a similar trend to our @xmath143 .",
    "in fact , the dependence of their @xmath317 seems to be well explained with formulae calculated by benedict  @xcite for the same device by invoking a similar criterion : the onset of soft modes  @xcite .",
    "we thank shinya watanabe , enrique tras , and herre van der zant for consistently useful discussions , and mehran kardar for helpful guidance to the literature on ladder arrays . research supported by a spanish mec - fulbright predoctoral fellowship ( mb ) , and by nsf grants",
    "dms-9500948 ( shs ) and dmr-9402020 ( tpo ) .",
    "although analogies between the ladder and strictly one - dimensional parallel arrays can be drawn , we show now how the single - vortex solution for the quasi - one - dimensional ladder is mathematically different from the kink - like vortex in 1-d parallel arrays .",
    "recall that the equations for the one - dimensional parallel array can be reduced to a discrete driven sine - gordon equation  @xcite if only self - inductances are considered .",
    "when @xmath71 , the discrete single - vortex solution is well approximated by the kink solution of the undriven , time - independent , infinitely - extended , one - dimensional continuum sine - gordon equation  @xcite : @xmath318\\}.\\ ] ] thus , the vortex corresponds to a @xmath145-jump centered at @xmath319 with a characteristic half - width @xmath320 .",
    "( incidentally , it has also been shown  @xcite that by introducing an effective @xmath321 , this functional form is also valid when mutual inductances are included ) .    for our no - inductance ladder array , it is also possible to obtain an approximate sine - gordon equation for the system .",
    "although there is no explicit inductance in the problem , the coupling between the vertical junctions is provided by the horizontal junctions via the fluxoid quantization .",
    "the approximate sine - gordon equation has been most simply obtained  @xcite by assuming that the horizontal phases are small : @xmath322 .",
    "then , the _ zero - current _ time - independent equations for the ladder ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath323 .",
    "this gives , in the continuum limit , the time - independent sine - gordon equation with no forcing and @xmath324 , where the cell size is taken as length unit .",
    "however , a better linearization is suggested by the numerics if we take the phase change in the vertical junctions @xmath325 as the small parameter . in other words , one should linearize about @xmath326 , not @xmath327 . in that case , we obtain the following more accurate sine - gordon equation : @xmath328 , with @xmath329 .",
    "we argue now that the numerically observed single - vortex configuration is not as accurately approximated by the kink  ( [ eq : kink ] ) as it is by our expression  ( [ eq : onevortex])([eq : bonevortex ] ) . to compare them , we particularize  ( [ eq : onevortex])([eq : bonevortex ] ) for @xmath71 for a long array such that @xmath330 .",
    "then , the vertical phases near the center of the vortex become @xmath331 with @xmath94 and @xmath332 given by  ( [ eq : scnvr ] ) and @xmath77 by @xmath333 note that in  ( [ eq : vortexlad ] ) we have not reduced the phases to the interval @xmath334 , to facilitate the comparison with  ( [ eq : kink ] ) .",
    "our solution resembles the sine - gordon kink in that it describes a @xmath145-jump with odd symmetry with respect to .",
    "however , both the functional forms and the characteristic lengths are different . figure  [ fig : sinegordon ] shows that the numerics are better approximated over a wide range of @xmath1 by  ( [ eq : vortexlad ] ) than by the sine - gordon kink  ( [ eq : kink ] ) .",
    "given the relative inappropriateness of the sine - gordon kink as a model of the vortex in the no - inductance ladder array , we conclude that even for the static case it is an oversimplification to reduce the ladder to a one - dimensional parallel array where the horizontal junctions are approximated by an effective inductance . other dynamic phenomena observed in the ladder , e.g , the dynamical mechanism of retrapping from the whirling mode , reinforce this statement and will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "following on the concepts and notation in sections  [ sec : analytical ] and  [ sec : depinning ] , we briefly consider the ladder with self - inductance .",
    "this is a first approximation to explore the effect of self - fields on the no - vortex solution and , consequently , on the global depinning current of the array .",
    "when self - inductances are included , the time - independent governing equations  ( [ eq : scequation1])([eq : scequation2 ] ) become @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the mesh current in plaquette @xmath50 and @xmath337 is the two - dimensional penetration depth and a measure of the discreteness of the array . due to the geometrical constraints of the ladder",
    ", it is readily seen that @xmath338 in this case .    for the no - vortex solution",
    "we still have @xmath339 and @xmath340 far from the edges . from  ( [ eq : selfind1 ] )",
    "we then get @xmath341 as for the case with no inductance ( @xmath342 ) . however , the horizontal phase is different and has to be calculated from the following nonlinear equation : @xmath343 this is a particular case of kepler s equation , studied in celestial mechanics  @xcite , which can be solved through the method of successive approximations . in our case ,",
    "a good approximation to @xmath344 over the whole range of @xmath1 is given by the first iteration of that method as : @xmath345    the procedure to account for the open boundaries is identical to that presented in section  [ sec : analytical ] .",
    "the results are also similar : the corrections decay exponentially from the edges as in  ( [ eq : correctionhor])([eq : scnvr ] ) .",
    "however , the characteristic length @xmath346 is now given by @xmath347 where @xmath348    to assess how the inductance affects the depinning current , we use  ( [ eq : selfindalpha ] ) and the @xmath349 obtained from ( [ eq : selfindhorizontal ] ) with a heuristic criterion similar to  ( [ eq : heuristic ] ) , @xmath350 to calculate @xmath351 . the results in figure  [ fig : selfinductance ]",
    "show that , for fixed @xmath352 , @xmath202 still decreases monotonically with @xmath1 . however , for a given @xmath1 , the value of the depinning current increases as @xmath352 diminishes .",
    "this is expected on physical grounds since an increase in the inductance @xmath353 implies larger self - fields which oppose the external applied magnetic field , thus decreasing the effective magnetic flux through the array .",
