    "beta pictoris , a type a5 iv star at a distance of @xmath119 pc from the earth , is one of the youngest close stars with an approximate age of @xmath2 myr @xcite .",
    "observational evidence indicates that this star is surrounded by a planetary debris disk @xcite .",
    "the close proximity of such a young circumstellar disk has made @xmath0 pictoris an ideal candidate for the study of the evolution of protoplanetary disks and planetary system formation .    in the past several years",
    ", there have been a number of reports of the detection of symmetric warps in the @xmath0 pictoris debris disk @xcite .",
    "models have best explained these warps as gravitational perturbations caused by planetary companions @xcite . among these reports ,",
    "the disk warps discovered by @xcite were explained as the edge - on projection of debris rings orbiting the central star .",
    "models of the flux density allow some parameters of these rings to be determined via @xmath3 fitting .",
    "@xcite proposed a multiple planet system to account for ring formation , noting that all adjacent rings are in mean - motion resonances .    in consideration of these findings ,",
    "we undertake here a study of the dynamical evolution of a multibody system similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of the stability of randomly generated systems within a portion of the total available parameter - space and briefly analyze the relationship between the parameters of the system and its orbital stability .",
    "the planetary system proposed by @xcite consists of four planets with radial distances and orbital inclinations equal to those of their corresponding warps ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) . to study the dynamics of this planetary system",
    ", we explore a parameter - space which includes the mass number of the four planets , their radii , and their positions and velocities . the mass and radius of @xmath0 pictoris",
    "are taken to be @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we consider planets with masses randomly chosen between one to three jupiter - masses . for each value of the mass of a planet",
    ", we calculate its radius assuming an average density equal to that of jupiter ( 1.33 g@xmath6 ) .",
    "we also assume that all planets are initially on direct keplerian circular orbits and their orbital phases are chosen randomly from the range @xmath7 .    to explore the orbital stability of this planetary system , we integrated the system for 50 myr using mercury integrator package vi @xcite .",
    "we considered the system to be stable if no planet came closer than three hill s radii or obtained a radial distance larger than 1000 au .",
    "we ran a total of 20457 simulations using randomly generated values of planet masses and initial orbital phases .",
    "of this total , 14409 simulations used unique parameter sets .",
    "the remaining 6048 systems were exact replications of the systems in the unique set  a consequence of the random number generation routine .",
    "the duplicate systems have been kept for the sake of statistical analysis , since they are randomly distributed throughout the phase space .",
    "table 1 shows the statistical data for all simulations grouped in five 10 myr intervals .",
    "the middle two columns show the number and percentage of simulations that became unstable within their corresponding time intervals .",
    "the majority of the randomly generated systems became unstable at early stages of the integration , with their number decreasing as time increases .",
    "the rightmost column shows the percentage of the systems remaining stable beyond their respective time interval .",
    "as shown here , approximately 41% of the systems remained stable after the first 10 myrs . from these systems , 6.7% were still stable after 20 myr from the beginning of the integrations  the upper estimate of the lifetime of @xmath0 pictoris ( 20 myr ) . during the last 10 myr ,",
    "only 0.1% of all systems were still stbale .",
    ".statistical data on five - body system stability .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > \" , ]     figure [ stable_hist ] shows how stability lifetimes are distributed across a random sampling of the parameter - space .",
    "this histogram shows the number of systems that became unstable in @xmath8 year intervals .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that for a system chosen randomly within our assumed parameter - space , it is most probable that the stability lifetime of the system is approximately 7myr .",
    "it is also seen that no system became unstable at an age of less than 1.0myr .",
    "we note that 15 systems remained stable for the entire 50myr and are therefore not accounted for in the histogram .    in a preliminary attempt to determine the relationship between initial conditions and stability lifetime ,",
    "we have plotted the mass of each planet versus its initial phase - angle for those systems that remained stable for 50 myr ( fig .",
    "the initial phase of planet 1 was set to @xmath9 for all simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that none of these systems contain a planet with a mass greater than @xmath10 .",
    "we have analyzed the stability of the proposed five - body planetary system embedded in the @xmath0 pictoris debris disk @xcite for over 14000 initial conditions .",
    "our results indicate that the majority of systems became unstable between a time of 1 to 10 million years .",
    "there were only 8 unique simulations that remained stable for the entire 50myr integration time .",
    "these systems contained planets with masses less than 2.4 times the mass of jupiter .",
