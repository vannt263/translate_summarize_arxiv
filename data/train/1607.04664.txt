    "we assume a simple rigid hollow cylinder with the diameter of the hc - pbf .",
    "the equation for the displacement field , @xmath61 , given velocity , @xmath20 , is represented as @xmath62because the optical mode is radially symmetric , only the radially symmetric axial - radial acoustic modes will have nonzero coupling . assuming that the displacement field oscillates at frequency @xmath58 , the relevant equation for the displacement field is then @xmath63 where we have neglected the small contribution from @xmath64 .",
    "this is the equation for the bessel function of the first kind @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the relevant acoustic modes , @xmath65 , are given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a normalization constant .",

    "<S> is known of their acousto - optic ( or optomechanical ) interactions , and the dynamics , and noise that they can produce . </S>",
    "<S> only recently has coupling between mhz elastic waves within the silica matrix been quantified @xcite , and identified as a source of noise in quantum optics @xcite .    in this paper , we show that photon - phonon coupling mediated by air ( gasses ) within the hollow core of the fiber constitutes a much larger and perhaps more tailorable form of optomechanical coupling . through a combination of theory and experiment , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hollow core of the fiber acts as a conduit for guided acoustic waves in air . </S>",
    "<S> optical waves that are guided in this same region produce strong photo - acoustic coupling to these sound waves , yielding appreciable forward - brillouin coupling at mhz frequencies . using precision spectroscopy methods </S>",

    "<S> interfering optical waves produce time - varying optical forces that drive the excitation of acoustic waves . </S>",
    "<S> these elastic waves scatter light to new frequencies through dynamical changes in the dielectric response . depending on the type of deformation and the medium response </S>",
    "<S> , light can be scattered to optical modes with similar or dissimilar polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> these distinct scattering processes are termed intra - polarization and inter - polarization scattering respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that while elastic solids can mediate both intra- and inter - polarization scattering ( e.g. see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , inter - polarization scattering is generally forbidden in gasses . </S>",
    "<S> both scattering processes occur in solids because elastic deformation of a solid produces optical birefringence ( through the photoelastic effect ) that readily changes the polarization of light . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , pressure waves do not produce birefringence in typical gases ( e.g. nonchiral ) , meaning that inter - polarization scattering is forbidden .    </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , we consider forward stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) processes @xcite , not to be confused with more widely studied backwards stimulated brillouin scattering processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> through forward - sbs , co - propagating pump and stokes waves of frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled through parametrically generated phonons of frequency @xmath2 , as indicated by fig . </S>",

    "<S> an analogous set of conditions apply for the anti - stokes process .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to backward - sbs processes , the phase matching condition for forward - sbs is not satisfied by elastic waves in bulk media , and typically requires wave - guidance for both light and sound @xcite . due to the small wave - vector mismatch between the pump and stokes fields , only guided - acoustic phonons with nonzero frequencies for @xmath6 can mediate forward brillouin coupling . within the hc - pbf of fig . </S>",

    "<S> the brillouin coupling strength ( @xmath13 ) is determined by the overlap of the optical and acoustic fields , as well as by electrostrictive coupling parameters . by treating the inner glass boundary of the fiber as a hard reflecting boundary for sound </S>",
    "<S> , one finds a set of guided acoustic mode solutions ( for further details see supplement 1 ) . using the formalism described in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can show that the brillouin gain coefficient associated with intra- and inter- polarization scattering , denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , stems from the overlap between the dipole ( or electrostrictive ) forces that act to compress the gas , and the acoustic modes within the hollow core .    using an approximation for the acoustic profiles in terms of bessel functions and a gaussian approximation for the optical profile </S>",
    "<S> , one finds @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the refractive index , @xmath18 is the group index , @xmath19 is the mass density , @xmath20 is the sound velocity , @xmath21 is the core radius , @xmath22 is the speed of light , @xmath23 is the acoustic quality factor , @xmath24 is the @xmath25th zero of the first bessel function of the first kind ( @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 is a nondimensional coupling constant with the first five values ( for ar1-ar5 , e.g. ) given by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the bessel zeros arise from the boundary condition which constrains the radial displacement to zero at the radius of the hollow core . </S>",
    "<S> this same condition determines the acoustic resonance frequencies as @xmath29 ; further details can be found in supplement 1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that while the excited axial - radial modes ar1-arn satisfy the phase - matching conditions for forward brillouin scattering , the fundamental longitudinal mode ( @xmath30 ) can not ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ introfig ] ) .    the gain in air for the first five resonances is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4theory ] along with the optical field and electrostrictive force distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap integral of the first mode dominates over the higher order modes because this mode profile is well - matched to the optical forcing profile . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - order modes have alternating directions of displacement , which when forced optically in only one direction , results in a reduced coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the gain for the first mode ( ar1 ) is more than 200 times greater than it is for the next higher - order mode . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the simple analytical model predicts a single high - gain resonance at the same polarization as the driving beams ( intra - polarization ) at a frequency of @xmath31 mhz , with a coupling strength of @xmath32 w@xmath33m@xmath33 and a linewidth consistent with the acoustic loss of air at this frequency ( e.g. @xmath34 mhz @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> , a new frequency ( @xmath38 ) is detected at the output of the fiber . by polarization resolving the four frequencies we can separately measure @xmath14 and @xmath15 as a function of acoustic frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we can quantify inter- and intra - polarization coupling strengths and compare with theory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a frequency independent background due to kerr four - wave mixing is expected . for further details , </S>",
    "<S> see supplement 1 .        </S>",
    "<S> detection of the co - polarized scattered light field versus drive frequency reveals a single 4-mhz linewidth brillouin - active mode at 35 mhz , as seen in fig [ fig2dat](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this brillouin signature is absent from the orthogonal polarization ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2dat](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the intra - polarization scattering from this resonance is consistent with brillouin coupling to air . </S>",
    "<S> multiple narrower peaks are also observed at various frequencies in both polarizations which are consistent with brillouin scattering from the elastic modes supported by the fiber s silica micro - structure , as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these brillouin signatures sit atop a nonzero background that results from kerr nonlinearities .    from these spectra , the nonlinear brillouin gain , @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> can be determined using the known optical powers , fiber length , and coupling factor ( for further details see supplement 1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the gain after subtracting the power contribution from kerr four - wave mixing is then given by @xmath40 w@xmath33m@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the polarization , frequency , gain and linewidth are all consistent with guided brillouin scattering in air . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the forward - fbs gain given by experiment is three times larger than the prediction from the simple theoretical model presented above , which neglects the experimental complexity of the air and silica cladding .        to determine whether the discrepancies between the predicted frequencies and coupling strengths derived from our analytical formulation and experiment are due to our simplification of the fiber geometry , numerical simulations were performed . </S>",
    "<S> this full - vectorial model contains the complete ( hc-1550 - 02 ) hollow - core fiber geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the air filling all of the voids in the silica fiber matrix is taken to have a mass density of @xmath11 kg / m@xmath12 and a sound speed of 343 m / s . using the parameters of ref . @xcite and with additional discussions with these authors , we accurately specify the hollow - core fiber geometry . using comsol multiphysics solver , we solve for the fundamental optical mode ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3fullsim](a ) ) as well as for the first excited axial radial ( ar1 ) acoustic mode of the 2d hollow - core geometry ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3fullsim](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated frequency is 36 mhz and the forward - sbs gain is calculated and given by @xmath41 w@xmath33m@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this simulated gain agrees well with the measured value , which indicates that the silica / air cladding and the exact non - circular shape of the core contributes to the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the simple analytical model is useful for simple estimates of the coupling strengths and frequencies for arbitrary gases .        </S>",
    "<S> while these studies have focused on the properties of forward - sbs in air , it is also interesting to consider the prospects for enhancement of this effect by filling the fiber core with different atomic vapors . to appreciate the potential for enhancement , it is important to note that forward - sbs gain is proportional to the index of refraction of the brillouin - active gas . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the refractive index increases sharply for wavelengths near one or more absorption resonance of an atomic vapor . while high dispersion is typically accompanied by high absorption , this is not always the case . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , strong interactions with atomic resonances can be achieved with low optical absorption in the case of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since eit has been demonstrated in hollow - core fibers filled with rubidium @xcite as well as with cesium @xcite vapors , the study of gas mediated brillouin coupling could give rise to some intriguing new dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> combining these methods with the gas - mediated brillouin interactions described here , it may be possible to dramatically enhance and engineer new forms of forward - sbs in gas - filled hollow - core fibers .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed a new form of optomechanical coupling in air - filled hollow - core fibers </S>",
    "<S> . stimulated forward brillouin scattering is identified at a single 35-mhz resonance , corresponding to the first excited axial radial acoustic mode in the air - filled core . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytical model is developed , and refined by numerical simulations , which accurately predicts the coupling strength and frequency of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this new type of optomechanical interaction is highly tailorable and could allow for forward brillouin spectroscopy in any low - index gas and for sensing applications . </S>",
