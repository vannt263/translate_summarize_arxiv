    "photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) have attracted much interest due to their intriguing properties , many potential applications , as well as the recent development of successful technologies for their fabrication with engineered linear and nonlinear properties  @xcite .",
    "photonic crystal fibers are characterized by a conventional cylindric geometry with a two - dimensional lattice of air - holes running parallel the fiber optical axis .",
    "such pcf structures share the propagation properties of _ photonic crystals _ , based on the existence of the frequency gap with the transmission suppressed due to the bragg scattering , as well as the properties of conventional _ optical fibers _ , due to the presence of a defect in the structure acting as a pcf core .",
    "some of the pcf intriguing characteristics include the possibility to design single - moded pcfs independently on the light frequency even for a large core , allowing the guidance of high powers what makes pcfs very suitable for amplifiers or laser cavity applications .",
    "on the other hand , there exists an upper cutoff frequency by means of a reduction of the core index , and this also allows a very flexible control on the dispersion properties , supporting large shifts of the zero - dispersion point , and birefringence , which can be made much higher than in conventional fibers by a proper design .    in pcfs , light confinement is restricted to the core of the fiber and therefore nonlinear effects , such as light self - trapping and localization in the form of spatial optical solitons  @xcite , may become important .",
    "the stabilizing effect of periodic media for optical solitons has been observed in a number of cases .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional vector solitons that are unstable in uniform media were made stable in a medium with a periodic modulation of the refractive index  @xcite .",
    "also , discrete vector solitons where experimentally observed in two - dimensional optically - induced photonic lattices  @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of two - dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals  @xcite , it has been recently demonstrated numerically that a pcf can support and stabilize both fundamental and vortex spatial optical solitons  @xcite . in a sharp contrast with an entirely homogeneous nonlinear kerr medium where spatial solitons are unstable and",
    "may collapse , it was shown that the periodic structure of pcf can stabilize the otherwise unstable two - dimensional spatial optical solitons .    in this paper",
    ", we make a further step forward in the study of nonlinear effects in pcfs , in comparison with the recent analysis  @xcite , and analyze the existence and stability of spatial vector solitons in pcfs . in general ,",
    "vector solitons are defined as two - component mutually trapped localized beams whose properties may differ substantially from the properties of one - component scalar solitons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , two - dimensional vector solitons are known to be unstable in the nonlinear kerr medium ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in contrast , as we show in this paper , the periodic modulation of the refractive index in pcf provides an effective physical mechanism to stabilize the otherwise unstable two - dimensional spatial optical solitons .",

    "the vector solitons in both one- and two - dimensional cases have been studied earlier  @xcite",
    ". however , the lattice of air - holes and the central defect break the radial symmetry of the problem , and the corresponding vector solitons are not radially symmetric .",
    "in order to find the solutions for nonlinear localized modes , we consider a rectangular domain of the @xmath7 and apply a finite - difference scheme , taking @xmath16 and @xmath17 uniformly distributed samples of the variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , in order to cover all the domain . denoting those samples as @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , at each mapped point @xmath22 of the domain we consider the corresponding samples for all the functions defined in the equations : @xmath23 and , similarly , the second component @xmath24 , and the potential @xmath25 .",

    "the jacobian matrix presents a similar sparse structure as the matrix @xmath38 , and it can be calculated analytically . obviously , due to a huge size of the matrix @xmath49 , the system ( [ newton_step ] ) can only be solved iteratively . taking into account",

    "indeed , it is well known that in the nonlinear focusing kerr media without a nonlinearity saturation , the self - trapped optical beams are always unstable  @xcite .",
    "this instability can manifest itself as the beam spreading , when the input power is lower than that of the soliton , or the beam collapse , when the power is larger than the soliton power . as has been mentioned earlier by ferrando _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , such a soliton instability can be suppressed by the presence of the lattice of holes , because the external potential stops the beam spreading , as it happens in a conventional optical fiber , leading to the existence of a family of stable stationary beams .    in order to demonstrate this feature ,",
