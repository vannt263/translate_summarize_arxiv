    "the basic motivation for investigating the @xmath0 reaction near the kinematical threshold is comprehensively reviewed in  @xcite , as an attempt to understand the nature of the scalar resonances @xmath10(980 ) and @xmath11(980 ) , whose masses are very close to the sum of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses . besides the standard interpretation as @xmath14 mesons  @xcite , these resonances were also proposed to be @xmath15 states  @xcite , @xmath16 molecules  @xcite , hybrid @xmath14/meson - meson systems  @xcite or even quark - less gluonic hadrons  @xcite . the strength of the @xmath16 interaction is a crucial quantity regarding the formation of a @xmath16 molecule , whereas the @xmath17 interaction is of importance in view of the vigorous discussion concerning the structure of the excited hyperon @xmath18(1405 ) which is considered as a three quark system or as a @xmath17 molecular state  @xcite . additionally , these interactions appear to be very important also with respect to other phenomena , like possible kaon condensation in neutron stars  @xcite , or production of strange particles immersed in a dense nuclear medium studied by means of heavy ion collisions  @xcite",
    ".    measurements of the near threshold @xmath0 reaction have been made possible by beams of low emittance and small momentum spread available at storage ring facilities , in particular at the cooler synchrotron cosy at the research center in jlich in germany  @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the collision energy , in the order of fractions of mev , permitted to deal with the rapid growth of cross sections  @xcite and thus to take advantage of the threshold kinematics like , e.g. ,  full phase space coverage achievable with dipole magnetic spectrometers being rather limited in geometrical acceptance .",
    "early experiments on @xmath5 pair production at cosy conducted by the cosy-11 collaboration revealed , however , that the total cross section at threshold is by more than seven orders of magnitude smaller than the total proton - proton production cross section making the study difficult due to low statistics  @xcite .",
    "a possible influence from the @xmath10 or @xmath11 mesons on the @xmath5 pair production appeared to be too weak to be distinguished from the direct production of these mesons based on the cosy-11 data  @xcite .",
    "recent results obtained by the anke collaboration with much higher statistics can also be explained without the need of including the scalars @xmath10 or @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however , the combined systematic collection of data below  @xcite and above  @xcite the @xmath19 meson threshold reveal a significant signal in the shape of the excitation function which may be due to the @xmath20 and perhaps also to the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "this signal is based on the cosy-11 data which , as indicated by authors of article  @xcite , were analyzed calculating the acceptance without the inclusion of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "therefore a more detailed analysis of the cosy-11 data at excess energies of q  =  10  mev and 28  mev including now studies of both the differential cross section distributions and the strength of the final state interaction between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons was performed .",
    "the analysis is based on a generalization of the dalitz plot for four particles as proposed by goldhaber _",

    "these calculations differ from the experimental data by two orders of magnitude at q  =  10  mev and by a factor of about five at q  =  28  mev .",

    "triangle and circles represent the disto and anke measurements , respectively .",
    "the four points close to the threshold are results from the cosy-11 measurements .",

    "[ excitation - f ] ) , by folding its parameterization known from the three body final state  @xcite with the four body phase space , is closer to the experimental data , but does not fully account for the difference  @xcite",
    ". the enhancement may be due to the influence of @xmath25 and @xmath5 interaction which was neglected in the calculations .",
    "indeed , as shown by authors of reference  @xcite the inclusion of the @xmath26fsi ( solid line ) reproduces the experimental data for excess energies down to q  =  28  mev .",
    "these calculations of the cross section were accomplished under the assumption that the overall enhancement factor , originating from final state interaction in the @xmath23 system , can be factorised into enhancements in the @xmath24 and two @xmath26 subsystems  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the relative momenta of the particles in the first @xmath1 subsystem , second @xmath1 subsystem and @xmath24 subsystem , respectively .",
    "the factors describing the enhancement originating from the @xmath26fsi are parametrized using the scattering length approximation .",
    "it is important to note that the inclusion of the @xmath24 and @xmath26 final state interaction is not sufficient to describe the data very close to threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ excitation - f ] ) . this enhancement may be due to the influence of the @xmath5 interaction , which was neglected in the calculations   interaction was neglected .",

    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the observed increase of the total cross section near threshold may be due to the neglect of the @xmath26fsi in the calculations of the cosy-11 acceptance . as a consequence",
    "the extracted cross sections would decrease , if this interaction was taken into account during the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "this concern encouraged us to check quantitatively the influence of the interaction in the @xmath26 subsystem on the acceptance of the detection setup .",
    "in addition , absolute values for the differential distributions of the @xmath25 and @xmath31 invariant masses were extracted and generalized dalitz plot analysis of the data in view of the @xmath5 interaction , was performed .",

    "if a collision of protons leads to the production of a @xmath5 meson pair , then the reaction products , having smaller momenta than the circulating beam , are directed by the magnetic dipole field towards the cosy-11 detection system and leave the vacuum chamber through a thin exit foil  @xcite .",
    "tracks of positively charged particles , registered by drift chambers , are traced back through the magnetic field to the nominal interaction point leading to a momentum determination .",
    "the knowledge of the momentum combined with an independent measurement of the velocity , performed by means of the scintillation detectors s1 and s3 , permits to identify the registered particles and to determine their four momentum vectors .",
    "knowing both the four momenta of the three positively charged ejectiles and the proton beam momentum one can calculate the mass of the unobserved system @xmath34 . in the case of the @xmath22 reaction this should correspond to the mass of the @xmath13 meson , but we observe also background originating partly from the @xmath35 reaction , where the @xmath36 was misidentified as a @xmath12 meson , and in part due to the @xmath12 meson being associated with the hyperons @xmath18(1405 ) or @xmath37(1385 ) production  @xcite .",
    "this background , however , can be completely removed by demanding a signal in the silicon pad detectors ( mounted inside the dipole ) at the position where the @xmath13 meson originating from the @xmath22 reaction is expected . this clear identification allows to select the @xmath22 events and to determine the total and differential cross sections .",

    "moreover , the new more precise determination of the total cross sections from the differential @xmath44 distributions even increased the enhancement at threshold .",
    "+ in addition the analysis of the @xmath22 reaction has been extended to the determination of differential cross sections in view of the @xmath5 final state interaction . the extracted @xmath2 scattering length amounts to :      due to the low statistics the uncertainties are rather large . in this analysis",
    "we can not distinguish between the isospin i  =  0 and i  =  1 states of the @xmath2 system .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite , the production with i  =  0 is dominant in the @xmath0 reaction independent of the exact values of the scattering lengths .    regarding the comparison of the interactions in the @xmath26 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 subsystems , the absolute ratios determined from the cosy-11 data measured at q  =  10  mev and q  =  28  mev are consistent with the predictions based on the parametrization introduced in reference  @xcite and on the values of the scattering length @xmath100 extracted from the anke data at higher excess energies  @xcite .",
