    "the peierls - boltzmann equation ( pbe ) @xcite puts this on a firm footing .",
    "peierls made the important observation that wave - vector - conserving (  normal \" or  @xmath1 \" ) events ( @xmath5 ) can not by themselves cause a current - carrying state ( with non - zero total wave - vector ) to decay to a zero current state , but that umklapp (  @xmath0 \" ) events ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) , can relax the current to zero .",
    "solving the pbe is still not an easy task , but modern advances make it possible . in particular ,  _ ab initio _ \" computation of harmonic normal modes is now very successful @xcite ; similar techniques give quite reliable anharmonic forces @xcite ; thus full solutions from purely theoretical input are now being done with good success @xcite .",

    "the steady state distribution obeys @xmath35 .",
    "the distribution function relaxes toward a local equilibrium ( @xmath36 may vary spatially ) , with a small deviation @xmath37 . the aim is to find , to first order in @xmath38 , the heat current , defined as @xmath39 the spatial gradient term in the pbe eq.([eq : pbe ] ) can be linearized in the thermal gradient ; @xmath40 becomes @xmath41 .",

    "the idea is that the exact distribution function , @xmath46 , found by solving the linearized integral equation , can be written , in linear approximation , as @xmath47 .",
    "this defines a quantity @xmath48 which can be interpreted as the time for current relaxation in the channel @xmath9 .",
    "it is perhaps not very different from , but is surely not the same as , the ordinary `` quasiparticle '' relaxation time , defined using thermal green s function theory via the self - energy ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 .",
    "the question is , how to find an approximate @xmath45 that will give an accurate thermal conductivity , without the full labor of solving the pbe ?",
    "the choice @xmath51 has some advantages , since it is a well - defined object , measureable by neutron or x - ray scattering , and not overwhelming to compute by modern methods .",
    "it is also an object of interest in peierls - boltzmann theory .",
    "if all phonons @xmath52 are forced to be in equilibrium ( @xmath53 ) except when @xmath52 equals @xmath9 , then @xmath54 becomes @xmath55 .",
    "the pbe form for @xmath51 agrees with the green s function result in the usual anharmonic perturbation theory .",
    "the rta consists of using @xmath51 as the @xmath45 in eq.([eq : relaxpb ] ) .",
    "this underestimates the thermal conductivity . when @xmath56 , all collisions involving mode @xmath9 help relax the quasiparticle population of state @xmath9 ; however , there are @xmath1 processes which contribute to @xmath51 but can not be fully active in relaxing the current",
    ". they do nt fully contribute to @xmath48 .",
    "this is where the callaway model @xcite comes in .",
    "callaway s idea is to write @xmath57 in two parts , as @xmath58 .",
    "the collective relaxation rate , @xmath59 is just the total quasiparticle relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the part denoted @xmath60 , arising from anharmonic @xmath1-processes , leaves the total crystal momentum unchanged .",
    "only the `` @xmath0 '' part @xmath61 can relax to the final zero - current equilibrium .",
    "the part @xmath60 relaxes the distribution to the flowing equilibrium @xmath31 , eq.([eq : dispbe ] ) .",
    "when other mechanisms of phonon relaxation , such as disorder , are present , they also destroy crystal momentum conservation , and are grouped with the @xmath0 terms .",
    "the deviation @xmath62 ( eq . [ eq : j ] ) determines the current .",
    "deviation from the flowing equilibrium can be written by taylor expansion as @xmath63 .",
    "the callaway - modified rta therefore gives the distribution function as @xmath64 the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 is not yet determined .",
    "this is where my answer deviates a bit from callaway s",
    ".    the total crystal momentum @xmath65 ( eq . [ eq : p ] ) should be the same for both the actual distribution @xmath17 and the flowing equilibrium distribution @xmath31 that @xmath1 processes drive @xmath17 towards .",
    "this means @xmath66 taylor expanding gives @xmath67 inserting eqs.([eq : phi],[eq : nstar ] ) into eq.([eq : constraint ] ) gives an equation for the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 , @xmath68 this replaces eq.(14 ) of callaway s paper @xcite , which is equivalent except for an extra factor of @xmath60 inside the sums on both sides of the equation .",
    "why does callaway have a different formula fixing @xmath30 ?",
    "callaway uses the constraint that the time rate of change of @xmath65 from @xmath1 processes must vanish .",
    "this is surely an equally exact statement , but , in order to implement it , callaway makes an * additional * use of the relaxation time model .",
    "this gives an extra factor of @xmath60 inside both @xmath9-sums in eq.([eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "the model is inexact , and leads to a difference from eq.([eq : constr ] ) , which made no such additional approximation .",
    "insofar as callaway s eq.(14 ) differs from eq.([eq : constr ] ) , callaway s method is wrong .",
    "the argument simplifies by assuming cubic symmetry , or else a thermal gradient along a symmetry axis ( denoted @xmath69 ) of an orthorhombic crystal .",
    "then only @xmath70 is needed .",
    "its value cancels from eq.([eq : phi ] ) when the second term is multiplied by the left - hand side , and divided by the right - hand side , of eq.([eq : constr ] ) . when the resulting equation for @xmath71 is substituted into eq.([eq : j ] ) , a formula for the thermal conductivity results , @xmath72 the leading term , @xmath73 , is just the usual relaxation time formula , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the usual quasiparticle relaxation rate , @xmath76 , containing both @xmath1 and @xmath0 processes .",
    "the correction factors are @xmath77 eqs.([eq : kappaun]-[eq : lambda3 ] ) are the new result of this paper .",
    "they are an approximate procedure , based on the callaway model , which better contains the different roles of @xmath1 and @xmath0 scattering events .",
    "callaway s answer is similar , except that @xmath78 is replaced by the ratio @xmath79 in both @xmath80 ( eq.[eq : lambda1 ] ) and @xmath81 ( eq.[eq : lambda3 ] ) .    to see the consequence of this modification , the debye model is appropriate .",
    "it assumes three branches @xmath82 , with @xmath83 a constant sound velocity , the same for simplicity , for all three branches .",
    "the dispersion relations are spherically symmetric , and the brillouin zone approximated by a sphere of radius @xmath84 with maximum frequency @xmath85 .",
    "the debye density of states is @xmath86 .",
    "the specific heat is @xmath87 in the same spirit , one assumes scattering rates @xmath60 and @xmath61 to depend only on @xmath13 and @xmath36 , that is , the only @xmath9-dependence comes through @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it is common to assume that the resulting function factorizes into a power of frequency @xmath88 times a function of @xmath36 , @xmath89 if we look only at ratios , it will not be necessary to choose a @xmath36-dependence of @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath91 s , at low @xmath36 , the needed large @xmath9 thermal phonon is thermally suppressed by a factor often written as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a constant , independent of @xmath36 , and @xmath94 is the debye temperature , @xmath95 .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath96 is often set to @xmath97 .",
    "if is convenient to define a frequency average @xmath98 of a frequency - dependent function @xmath99 as @xmath100 then in the debye model , the answers eqs.([eq : kappa-1]-[eq : lambda3 ] ) become @xmath101 then my result for the callaway model in debye approximation is @xmath102 callaway s solution has an extra factor @xmath60 in both @xmath103 and @xmath104 . then eq.([eq : kappad ] ) is replaced by @xmath105 the notations @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the present ( new and corrected ) solution of callaway s model in debye approximation , and the original ( old and uncorrected ) solution .    finally , it is necessary to choose power laws , @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 scattering rates .",
    "following herring@xcite , the @xmath1-processes are assumed to have quadratic @xmath88 dependence , @xmath110 .",
    "this has been confirmed in recent numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "herring also suggested quadratic behavior @xmath111 for the @xmath88 dependence of @xmath0 processes .",
    "however , numerical calculations have been recently fit to larger powers , @xmath112 ( ref . ) and @xmath113 ( ref . ) .",

    "the dashed curves use the herring quadratic behavior also for @xmath0 , with ratio @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the solid curves have @xmath112 or @xmath117 , and the same form for @xmath118 . in both cases ,",
    "the four curves , from lowest to highest , are for values of @xmath93 set to 1 , 2 , 4 , and 10 . , width=359 ]    callaway s solution @xmath107 underestimates the suppression of @xmath1-scattering , and thus underestimates the thermal conductivity .",
    "i believe that @xmath106 , the larger solution , is the true solution of callaway s model . in the low @xmath36 limit",
    ", integrals can be done analytically . in herring s case ( @xmath119 ) , the ratio @xmath120 , and in the case @xmath110 , @xmath112 ,",
    "the ratio becomes @xmath121 . at higher @xmath36 , as @xmath0 scattering increases to the level of @xmath1 scattering , the difference between callaway s old solution and the present new one is smaller .",
    "the new solution simplifies in the case @xmath122 , as , for example , in herring s case where both are 2 .",
    "the complexities in eq.([eq : kappad ] ) cancel , leaving @xmath123 .",
    "this is true at all @xmath36 , leaving the simple answer @xmath124 ; @xmath1-scattering drops out completely .",
    "this is definitely not true of callaway s solution . for more realistic models , for example , with @xmath112 , frequency integrals are more complicated , and @xmath1 scattering does not completely disappear .",
    "in fact , since @xmath0 scattering has apparently an @xmath125 or @xmath126 limiting behavior , and impurity scattering has the rayleigh form @xmath127 , the quadratic behavior of the @xmath1 term is the only thing that prevents a low-@xmath88 divergence in the integrals .",
    "a low-@xmath88 divergence is not completely unphysical . at low enough @xmath36 ,",
    "the only vibrations thermally excited are sure to have mean free paths longer than sample size . whether or not their contribution to the integrals for @xmath128 converge , they in fact do not contribute currents governed by temperature gradients .",
    "instead , they give ballistic currents determined by the difference available heat ( _ i.e. _ @xmath129 ) in the baths at the two ends .",
    "the integrals have to be cut off at some @xmath130 whose value depends on sample size .    ) to full solution @xmath106 for the callaway model in debye approximation with quadratic @xmath88 dependence for @xmath131 and quartic @xmath88 dependence for @xmath132 .",
    "the four solid curves use the same parameters as the solid curves of fig.[fig : edelta ] .",
    "the dashed curves have @xmath133 ( as does the top solid curve ) , but also include rayleigh - type impurity scattering ( @xmath134 ) , a momentum - non - conserving event which adds to @xmath132 without the low-@xmath36 thermal suppression .",
    "the strength of the impurity term is @xmath135 ( from the lowest dashed curve to the highest.),width=359 ]    fig.[fig : ddelta ] shows some of the same results as fig.[fig : edelta ] , except in a different ratio , comparing with the relaxation - time approximation rather than the original callaway approximation .",
    "also shown is the effect of including large amounts of momentum - non - conserving impurity scattering .",
    "enhancement of thermal conductivity is still quite large , since @xmath1 scattering dominates @xmath136 at low @xmath36 .",
    "however , the enhancement is smaller because @xmath137 exceeds @xmath132 at lower @xmath36 .",
    "computation is now advanced enough to give a final answer to the question , how realistic is callaway s model ?",
    "there are good algorithms for accurate construction and solution of the pbe , at least at @xmath36 not too low ( where mesh size becomes a problem because only small @xmath2 phonons are excited . )",
    "an iterative solution of the pbe begins with a first iteration which is the rta .",
    "this requires full computation of the quasiparticle relaxation rate , @xmath138 .",
    "it is straightforward in principle to separate this into @xmath1 and @xmath0 parts .",
    "these could be used to obtain the callaway model solution from @xmath139 of eqs.([eq : lambda1]-[eq : lambda3 ] ) .",
    "if a full interative solution of the pbe is then completed , it would be interesting to compare with the callaway solution .    in the herring version of the debye approximation to the callaway model , with anharmonic phonon scattering rates going like @xmath140 for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the answer is that @xmath1 processes drop out , and the umklapp scattering determines the conductivity .",
    "this is a nice , but oversimple result .",
    "once the model gets more complex , with multiple momentum relaxing processes with differing @xmath88-dependences , @xmath1 processes no longer drop out completely , but can not alone relax the distribution @xmath17 to the zero - current distribution . for models more realistic than debye",
    ", n - processes can relax the current toward a value @xmath141 , but still can not relax the current completely .",
    "there has been a practice of computing only @xmath142 , sometimes with the claim that the boltzmann equation has thus been solved .",
    "two arguments may seem to support this .",
    "first , callaway used his solution to fit quite accurately the measured @xmath143 of ge .",
    "he did not find much enhancement beyond rta from the reduced role of n processes .",
    "this must be , at least partly , an artifact of the inaccuracy of his solution .",
    "thus callaway s work seems to approximately support the rta , but the support can not be taken seriously .",
    "the second argument is that the corrections are not often as big in complex materials as they are in the debye model shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : edelta ] and [ fig : ddelta ] ) .",
    "several converged iterative solutions of the pbe have been reported that include some discussion of the departure of the full solution from the rta .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "2 show an 80% increase in @xmath144 for diamond , by converging the pbe rather than using rta .",
    "the increase lowers to 30% at 1200k .",
    "however , in other systems , the error is often not so large .",
    "for example , fig . 3 of chernatynskiy _ et al .",
    "@xcite shows that for mgo , the effect on @xmath145 is only a 7% increase , and the effect is smaller in uo@xmath146 . in srtio@xmath147 , where the effect is tiny at 250k ,",
    "it is 7% at 50k and a 42% increase at 20k @xcite .",
    "the message is , that for materials with complex phonon spectra , u processes are only thermally suppressed at quite low @xmath36 .",
    "this is why the inability of n processes alone to degrade heat current does not show up except at low @xmath36 and with pure samples ( including isotopic purity ) .",
    "the recent prediction of large @xmath128 in bas @xcite is related to weakness of u processes ( and the resulting ineffectiveness of n processes ) caused by phonon dispersion that is quite simple and also unusual .",
    "it would be interesting to ask whether the callaway model has decent predictive power in this case .",
    "even if not predictive , the callaway model has given needed insight , and should continue to do so .",
    "therefore , the corrected ( and simpler ) solution of this model found in this paper should have some value .    * acknowledgements *   i am grateful to tao sun for discussions that motivated this work .",
