    "cosmic observations @xcite are now strongly supporting the idea of primordial inflation @xcite . according to the inflationary scenario , the primordial perturbations , which are seeds for the inhomogeneous structure of our universe , are created from the field fluctuations that are generated quantum mechanically during inflation @xcite . in the simplest inflationary scenario ,",
    "the fluctuations of the inflaton , where energy drives accelerated expansion , turn into the curvature perturbations when its wavelength becomes larger than the hubble length during inflation .",
    "once generated , the curvature perturbation remains constant and this is the primordial perturbation that can be compared with cmb observations .",
    "this simple scenario , however , may not be the one that actually happened in our universe .",
    "for example , in the curvaton scenario @xcite , a curvaton , a scalar field other than the inflaton , plays a role of creating the primordial perturbation . in this scenario ,",
    "the curvaton perturbations turn into the curvature perturbation after inflation when the curvaton decays into the radiation .",
    "there are many other models in which the primordial perturbations are created after inflation such as inhomogeneous end of inflation @xcite , modulated reheating scenario @xcite etc .. a common feature among all these models is that the curvature perturbation , once generated from zero remains constant outside the horizon .",
    "although these nonstandard scenarios are already contrived , the real universe may have evolved even more complicated manner , say , with multiple curvatons dominating at different epochs .",
    "such a scenario has been studied in @xcite and @xcite , the former focusing on the power spectrum and the latter on the bispectrum . in @xcite , although not emphasized , it was implicitly shown that if the two curvatons dominate the universe at different epochs from each other , the curvature fluctuations may evolve in a dramatically different way than the standard case .",
    "that is , they can grow to an amplitude much larger than the observed value , @xmath0 , when the first curvaton dominates and decays , and then they are moderated to the observed amplitude when the second curvaton dominates and decays .",
    "thus in this scenario the curvature perturbation can be temporarily enhanced . at first glance , this temporal enhancement seems to have little effect on observables since it must occur , if at all , much before the big - bang nucleosynthesis , not to mention the observation time .",
    "but this is not the case .",
    "we can provide at least three possible interesting consequences from this effect .",
    "the first possibility is that , as pointed out in @xcite , large possibly detectable non - gaussian perturbations can be generated . if we denote by @xmath8 the maximum amplitude of the curvature perturbation when it is enhanced , the so - called @xmath4 parameter is given by @xmath9 , under the assumption that the curvature perturbation is sourced only by the first decaying curvaton fluctuations .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 , then we get @xmath11 .",
    "the second possibility is generation of stochastic gravitational waves(gws ) whose peak frequency can fall into a range of the gw detectors .",
    "it is well known that at second order in perturbation the scalar - scalar coupling can source the gws , most efficiently when the scalar mode reenters the horizon @xcite .",
    "since the amplitude of gws is proportional to the square of the curvature perturbations , we expect that large amplitude of gws can be generated at the horizon scales when the curvature perturbation is being enhanced .",
    "the third possibility is a formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) @xcite .",
    "if @xmath8 is very large , the perturbation mode which reenters the horizon when the curvature perturbation is being enhanced may undergo a gravitational collapse to form a black hole . since the abundance of pbhs on various masses are tightly constrained from cosmic observations ( see @xcite for the latest results ) , we can limit a range of the parameters of the two curvaton model by using such constraints .",
    "the present paper aims to take up this temporal enhancement of the curvature perturbation in two curvaton model , to provide a detailed analysis of the generation and evolution of fluctuations and to discuss three observational implications mentioned above .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in a situation where both curvatons dominate the universe at different epochs . before going to the detailed analysis of the scenario ,",
    "let us first explain four non - trivial assumptions needed for the designing scenario to work , along with the basic history of the universe under consideration .",
    "the first assumption we will take in this paper is that , other than the inflaton , there are two light free scalar fields ( we call them @xmath12-field and @xmath13-field , respectively . ) having vevs smaller than the planck scale in the early universe . by light ,",
    "we mean that masses of both curvatons are much smaller than the expansion rate of the universe when it is reheated by the decay of the inflaton , @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being masses of the two curvatons and @xmath17 the hubble parameter at the time of reheating .",
    "this condition means that both curvatons are almost massless during inflation .",
    "it is well known that such a light scalar field aquires classical fluctuation of order @xmath18 on super - horizon scales .",
    "the requirement of vevs smaller than the planck scale is to avoid the second inflation caused by a curvaton .",
    "although this requirement is not essential , we take it for simplicity .    after inflation ends ,",
    "the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential and finally decays into radiation to complete reheating .",
    "then the radiation dominated universe starts . at this stage ,",
    "both curvatons are still subdominant .",
    "therefore , those fluctuations have not yet contributed to the curvature perturbation .",
    "the next assumption is that both curvatons start to ocsillate during this radiation dominated epoch .",
    "if the secondly decaying curvaton starts to oscillate after the first decaying curvaton decays , the temporal enhancement of the curvature perturbation , which is the main focus of this paper , does not occur .",
    "therefore , we do not consider such a case .",
    "since the ocsillating free scalar field can be treated as non - relativistic particles , we can assume that the universe consists of the radiation coming from inflaton , two non - relativistic particles that are not interacting . during this epoch",
    ", the fraction of energy densities of both curvatons grows in proportion to the scale factor while the ratio between energy densities of the two curvatons stays constant .",
    "we call this era epoch a.    without a loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath12-field decays first and @xmath13-field decays later , @xmath19 .",
    "then , the third assumption is that the energy density of @xmath12-field in epoch a is much larger than that of @xmath13-field and there is a period when @xmath12-field dominates the universe .",
    "we call such a period epoch b. since the @xmath12-field is dominating the universe , it is this epoch when the @xmath12-field perturbation is mostly converted to the curvature perturbation . by exactly the same reasoning as the single curvaton case , the curvature perturbation at this epoch is given by @xmath20 ( precise definition of the curvature perturbation and regorous calculations will be given later . ) .",
    "since the @xmath13-field is subdominant during this epoch , keeping its energy fraction constant , the @xmath13-field fluctuations have not been converted to the curvature perturbations yet .",
    "when the hubble parameter becomes @xmath21 , the @xmath12-field decays into the radition and the universe is again dominated by the radiation .",
    "we call a period dominated by such radiation epoch c.    our last assumption is that the @xmath13-field finally dominates the universe before it decays . in other words ,",
    "@xmath22 should be small enough to allow the @xmath13-field to dominate the universe .",
    "we call a period dominated by the @xmath13-field epoch d. during this epoch , since the universe evolves like a matter dominated universe , the radiation generated from the decay of the @xmath12-field is diluted . because of this dilution , the curvature perturbation coming from the radiation perturbation is reduced by a factor @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a fraction of the radiation energy density to the total one",
    ". meanwhile , the @xmath13-field contributes to the curvature perturbation by @xmath25 .",
    "when the hubble parameter becomes equal to @xmath22 , the @xmath13-field decays into radiation and the universe is again dominated by the radiation .",
    "since there are no isocurvature perturbations any more , the curvature perturbation remains constant and this should be regarded as the final perturbation that can be compared with the cosmological observations such as cmb .",
    "thus , the primordial perturbation at the linear order is estimated as @xmath26 where @xmath24 must be evaluated at the time when @xmath13-field decays . from observations , we know that this is about @xmath0 .    from those arguments , we find that the curvature perturbation evolves from zero to @xmath27 at epoch b and then decays to @xmath28 . just for an illustration ,",
    "let us choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in this case , curvature perturbation is temporarily amplified to @xmath31 and then decays to the observed value @xmath0 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that the existence of more than a single curvaton is essential to make the curvature perturbations decay in time .",
    "one may consider a simpler situation where the inflaton generates large amplitude of the curvature perturbations by the standard mechanism and a curvaton that acquires little quantum fluctuations during inflation dominates the universe at late time .",
    "in this case , attenuation of the curvature perturbation due to the curvaton dominance does not happen .",
    "instead , the large amplitude of the curvature perturbations of the inflaton origin is taken over by the curvaton because the epoch when the curvaton starts its oscillations is modulated .",
    "we need at least two fields other than the inflaton to have a sensible model in which the temporal enhancement happens .    in the following sections , we will give more quantitative discussions of this scenario and some interesting consequences .",
    "in this subsection , we see how the background quantities evolve in time . the periods we focus on are from epochs a to d whose definitions are given in sec.[sec.basic ] .",
    "the background spacetime is the spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe whose metric is given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the conformal time . as we mentioned in the last subsection , we can treat the dynamics of the curvatons as collections of non - relativistic particles .",
    "therefore , the energy - momentum tensor for each curvaton can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 runs @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the four - velocity of @xmath35-field with a normalization condition @xmath39 .    while the total energy - momentum tensor obeys the conservation law ,",
    "each energy - momentum tensor is no longer conserved because curvaton fields decay into radiation @xcite ; @xmath40 where @xmath41 now represents radiation , @xmath36 or @xmath37 . the r.h.s . represents the transfer of the energy and momentum of the fluid .    at the background order , @xmath42 for each fluid",
    "is given by @xmath43 because of the isotropy of the background spacetime , all the spatial components are zero .",
    "therefore , the evolution equations for the background quantities are given by @xmath44 where a prime and an overdot denote differentiation with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath45 , respectively , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "from the first two equations , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary time in the epoch a. substituting these solutions into the third equation , we get @xmath50 the designing situation in this paper is that both two curvatons dominate the universe at different epochs .",
    "we give in fig.[fig : background ] a typical evolution of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we see that their evolution can be clearly devided into four epochs explained in the last section . during epoch a , both of them grows as @xmath53 . during epoch",
    "b , @xmath54 and @xmath55 stays constant . during epoch c , @xmath52 starts to grow again like @xmath53 . during epoch d , @xmath56 and",
    "this epoch terminates by the decay of the @xmath13-field .      and",
    ". we chose @xmath57 and @xmath58.,title=\"fig : \" ]      before discussing perturbation behaviors and their consequences , we give basic evolution equations for the scalar perturbations .",
    "we write the perturbed metric of the scalar type in the conformal newtonian gauge : @xmath59 for the matter perturbations , we intoduce density contrast and the velocity perturbation by @xmath60 note that @xmath61 is completely determined by the metric perturbation by using the normalization condition .    at the linear order in the perturbation , @xmath62 for each fluid",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath63 the second terms in ( [ qa - pert ] ) and ( [ qb - pert ] ) represent an effect due to the modulation of time .",
    "@xmath64 for the radiation is obtained from the conservation law for the total energy momentum . using these equations",
    ", we find that the continuity equation and the euler equation for each fluid are given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , where @xmath67 is the comoving wavenumber . from the perturbed einstein equations , we can derive the following evolution equations : @xmath68      since understanding the evolution of the curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales is important for our purposes , let us next consider the perturbation behavior on super - horizon scales , postponing the analysis on sub - horizon scales of perturbations .",
    "the evolution equations on super - horizon scales can be obtained by setting @xmath69 in the perturbation equations we gave in the last subsection .    in fig.[fig : perturbation ] , we show a typical evolution of @xmath70 which is obtained by solving numerically the perturbation equations with @xmath69 .",
    "we started the calculation at a time when the expansion rate @xmath71 is much larger than @xmath21 , with the initial conditions in the epoch a given by the analytic approximation : @xmath72 where @xmath73 represent terms that are suppressed at early time with higher powers of @xmath51 and/or @xmath52 .",
    "since we assume that inflaton fluctuation contributes little to the curvature perturbation , we have imposed the condition that both @xmath74 and @xmath70 vanish at the outset .",
    "the parameters used in fig.[fig : perturbation ] are such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the parameters for the background are the same as the ones used in fig.[fig : background ] .     .",
    "since @xmath70 is negative , we plot @xmath77 .",
    "we chose @xmath78.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from fig.[fig : background ] , we can clearly see that @xmath70 is enhanced during epoch b. the order of @xmath70 at this time is roughly @xmath79 ( we will provide exact analytic expression later . ) .",
    "this enhancement still persists during epoch c until the @xmath13-field dominates the universe .",
    "as the @xmath13-field dominates , @xmath70 decays to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is @xmath24 evaluated at the time when the @xmath13-field decays .",
    "therefore , the enhanced value of the curvature perturbation is determined by @xmath79 and the final value is determined by either @xmath82 or @xmath83 , whichever is greater .",
    "the behavior of @xmath102 in the regime d can also be understood similarly replacing the suffix 1 by 2 .",
    "when @xmath97 dominates over @xmath107 , we find @xmath108 , so that the total curvature perturbation reads @xmath109 which clearly shows that as the fraction @xmath110 increases the large curvature perturbation due to @xmath111 is regulated to a smaller value to reach the final value @xmath112 here @xmath113 denotes the ratio of radiation energy from @xmath96 to @xmath97 upon decay of @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 hold because @xmath70 is negligible and @xmath116 at the outset .",

    "@xmath129 is another numerical value .",

    "<S> if more than one curvaton dominate the universe at different epochs from each other , curvature perturbations can be temporarily enhanced to a value much larger than the observed one @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the traces of the enhancement may be left as higher order correlation functions , that is , as non - gaussianity , the stochastic gravitational waves that are sourced by scalar - scalar mode couplings , as well as the primordial black holes that are formed by the gravitational collapse of the enhanced curvature perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we first confirm that such a temporal enhancement indeed occurs by solving the linearized perturbation equations both numerically and analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive an analytic expression of the full - order curvature perturbation which does not rely on the frequently used sudden decay approximation and is exact on super - horizon scales . by using this analytic formula , we provide expressions of the non - linearity parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . if both two curvatons contribute to the final curvature perturbations , the strong non - gaussianity appears in the trispectrum rather than in the bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a unique consistency relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 without @xmath4 . by using the second - order perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> we numerically show that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves has a plateau corresponding to duration of the enhancement and such gravitational waves can be probed by ultimate - decigo and space - based atomic interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> we finally calculate the abundance of the primordial black holes and put a constraint on the amplitude of the enhanced curvature perturbations .    </S>",
