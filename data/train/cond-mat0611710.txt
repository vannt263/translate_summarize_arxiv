    "the behaviour of many - particle classical and quantum systems in presence of a random perturbation is a long - standing problem of great scientific interest .",
    "various methods have been developed to describe the behaviour of a system subject to the random external force , such as the coherent potential and other effective medium types of approximations @xcite , the self - consistent hydrodynamic scheme for the description of the overdamped charge dynamics in presence of a quenched disorder , elaborated by w. gtze and coworkers @xcite , the replica theories of flux lattices and wigner crystals @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe , that for very different model systems in the localization regime , many quantities of physical interest , such as the dynamic conductivity , were found to manifest an intimate resemblance .",
    "e.g. , in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron system , the drude tail of the optical conductivity flattens out and gradually evolves into a finite energy peak as the system approaches the anderson transition @xcite from the metallic side of the phase diagram .",
    "similar results are obtained for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas and also for 2d and 3d bose gas at zero temperature @xcite , where the effects of the disorder lead to the decay of the coherent response of the condensate @xmath1 and the transfer of the spectral weight to a finite - energy broad feature .",
    "the same general picture holds also for pinned density waves @xcite and wigner crystals @xcite , where the conductivity displays the inhomogeneously broadened feature at the pinning energy .    however , the understanding of the disorder effects in complex quantum systems is still an issue , that have been given the new impetus since the discovery of the strongly correlated oxides .",
    "an extreme complexity of these problems usually rules out the possibility of a tractable analytic treatment . in this article",
    "we present a simple exactly solvable model of the superfluid - insulator transition in the 2d bose gas with logarithmic interaction in presence of the random short - range potential of the point defects at zero temperature .",
    "the key result of our analysis is the analytic expression for the memory function , obtained within the framework of the mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "this enables us to explore the evolution of the optical conductivity in the full range of the relevant physical parameters and to trace the superfluid - insulator transition , that takes place , when a dimensionless parameter of the disorder exceeds a critical value .",
    "despite a number of simplifying assumptions , we believe , that the theory , developed in the next section , is of a certain interest , being an elementary but instructive exactly solvable model of the disorder - induced glass transition .",
    "the central role in our analysis plays the memory function @xmath2 , that measures the relaxation rate of the current excitations and incorporates the effects of an external random perturbation due to the impurities .    within the mode coupling theory @xcite",
    "the memory function obeys the self - consistency relation :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a bare relaxation constant , corresponding to some internal current decay channels , @xmath5 is the fourier transform of the random potential , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the concentration and the mass of the particles , respectively .",
    "the angular brackets stand for the averaging over the disorder .",
    "the density response function @xmath8 is related to the generalized susceptibility @xmath9 of the system without disorder : @xmath10 thus , the free model being specified by its correlation functions , eq .",
    "( [ memory ] ) offers a direct way to explore the effects of the disorder on its electric and optical properties .",
    "we consider the 2d bose gas at zero temperature , where all particles are condensed into the superfluid phase .",
    "hence , no bare mechanisms of relaxation are presumed and @xmath11 in ( [ memory ] ) .",
    "the susceptibility of noninteracting 2d bosons is readily obtained @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dispersion of free particles .",
    "the interparticle interaction @xmath14 modifies the susceptibility .",
    "a qualitative estimate of this effect may be done within the random phase approximation : @xmath15 having in mind to work out a simple tractable model , we neglect here a certain limitation of this mean - field type of approximation in low dimensions , as well as the local - field corrections @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field concept retains its significance as a highly intuitive approach , that makes it possible to get insight even into the problems , where its formal substantiation is problematic , e.g. in the physics of the superfluid films @xcite and the plane vortices in quasi - two - dimensional magnets @xcite .    in purely two - dimensional systems , such as the planar vortices ,",
    "the axially symmetric solution of the 2d laplace equation provides the following form of the interparticle interaction : @xmath16 ( the two - dimensional analog of the coulomb potential ) , where q is the boson charge and @xmath17 is an appropriate length scale , that may be considered as a mean interparticle distance , @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is the two - dimensional concentration of particles .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath19 is repulsive for @xmath20 and attractive for @xmath21 , favouring the homogenisation of the system .",
    "the ground - state properties of the free 2d bose gas with the interaction ( [ log ] ) have been investigated in @xcite . correspondingly , the potential in momentum space is : @xmath22 that may be obtained as the 2d fourier transform of @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "hereafter it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , defining the units of momentum and energy as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . )",
    "differs from that of the conventional 3d charge by a factor @xmath30 in what follows , we shall consider the case of identical impurities , with random coordinate distribution .",

    "( [ memory ] ) then reduces to the multiplication by the impurity concentration @xmath32 . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ fi2]-[rpa ] ) with ( [ logk ] ) into ( [ memory ] ) yields the nonlinear equation on the memory function , where all quantities are reduced to the dimensionless form and tilda s are omitted : @xmath33 thus , the optical response of the model is governed by a single parameter @xmath34 where @xmath35 measures the strength of the impurity potential , @xmath36 .",
    "note , that @xmath35 has the dimension of energy , and that of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the similar non - linear equations on @xmath39 have been derived early on for the 2d and 3d bose gas with the coulomb repulsion @xcite . however , their analytic solution were never possible because of the complexity of the integrand .",
    "in what follows , we focus on the special case of the short - range impurity centers , that is usually considered in the theory of pinned density waves and wigner crystals : @xmath40 , whence @xmath41 .",
    "then , the integral in rhs . of ( [ mlog1 ] ) can be solved to yield the quadratic equation for @xmath42 , whence we obtain the explicit expression for the memory function : @xmath43 where the root with the non - negative imaginary part is to be chosen .",
    "this is the main result of the present article .",
    "note , that within the mode - coupling theory eq .",
    "( [ mlog ] ) is an _",
    "exact _ relation .",

    "the arrow indicates the edge of the incoherent wing , that falls to the same frequency for both curves 1 and 3 .",
    "for the sake of clearness , the infinitely narrow @xmath46-like peak in the superfluid phase is shown broadened.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ fig1 ]   of the incoherent wing , eq.([s2 ] ) , on the disorder parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the knee at @xmath48 indicates the superfluid - insulator transition.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the optical response of the system is most conveniently studied in terms of the optical conductivity . within the memory function approach",
    "this is expressed in the generalized drude form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the complex frequency , @xmath51 is the plasma frequency ( @xmath52 , where @xmath6 , @xmath53 and @xmath7 are the concentration , charge and mass of bosons , respectively ) .",
    "the explicit analytic expression for the memory function ( [ mlog ] ) makes it possible to explore various regimes of the conductivity of the system .",
    "first of all , it is straightforward to show , that this results preserves the sum - rule : @xmath54 that we notice as an important sign of the sound behaviour of the present model .    turning to the detailed analysis of the conductivity spectrum , let us consider first the weak disorder limit , @xmath55 . expanding the generalized drude formula ( [ drude ] )",
    "to first order in @xmath47 , we arrive at the following expression for the real part of the optical conductivity at finite frequencies : @xmath56 thus , the spectrum shows a gap , that a more accurate treatment finds to extend at @xmath57 .",
    "the free system parameters being fixed , this gap frequency is governed by the amplitude of the disorder ( pinning ) potential . above the gap , the optical conductivity @xmath58 displays a broad asymmetric feature , shown in fig .",
    "it corresponds to the localized plasma oscillations of the charge density and is hereafter called the incoherent wing .",
    "such a behaviour is typical of the charge density waves .",
    "interestingly , we recover in ( [ incoh ] ) the expression for the conductivity of pinned cdw , first derived by fukuyama and lee @xcite .",
    "we believe this result to be the consequence of a nontrivial analogy between the pinned cdw and the disordered bose condensate , albeit such a literal coincidence of the formulas is rather accidental .",
    "the point is that pinned cdw is a collective state , that can be described by a model of a particle in a potential well @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the condensate at @xmath0 is also a collective ( coherent ) state , that behaves as a single particle .",
    "however , it follows from the sum - rule ( [ sumrule ] ) , that the contribution of @xmath59 ( [ incoh ] ) to the optical conductivity spectrum can not be the only one , since it vanishes as @xmath47 tends to zero . as eq.([incoh ] ) is reasonable at @xmath60 large , the careful examination of the conductivity at low frequencies is required .",
    "the corresponding expansion of the memory function ( [ mlog ] ) is : @xmath61    the behaviour of the system depends critically on the magnitude of @xmath47 . according to eq .",
    "( [ mz0 ] ) , the memory function is linear near the zero frequency for small disorder parameter , ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the corresponding optical conductivity is : @xmath63 this expression describes the coherent response of the condensate .",
    "its spectral weight drops linearly as the disorder parameter @xmath47 increases .",
    "according to the sum - rule ( [ sumrule ] ) , this implies the emergence of the new spectral feature at higher frequencies , described by @xmath59 ( [ incoh ] ) .",
    "the full conductivity spectrum is the sum of the coherent ( [ coh ] ) and incoherent ( [ incoh ] ) contributions , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the strong disorder regime ( @xmath64 )",
    ", one obtains from ( [ mz0 ] ) in the leading order @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . within the theory of the liquid - glass transitions @xcite this pole of the memory function",
    "is known as the non - ergodicity pole and its appearance is identified with the onset of the glass phase as it calls forth the long - lived density fluctuations @xmath67 , that do not decay to zero at large times .",
    "thus , we call the insulating phase of our model the bose glass .",
    "the superfluid - glass transition may be clearly visualized by considering the partial spectral weight of the incoherent contribution , @xmath68 this quantity is shown in fig.[fig2 ] against the disorder parameter @xmath47 .",
    "it can be seen , that @xmath69 grows progressively as @xmath47 approaches unity from below , i.e. the spectral weight moves away from the condensate to the localized modes . however , it does no longer change as soon as @xmath64 , although @xmath70 continues to grow .",
    "this is because no spectral weight is now contained below @xmath70 and the superfluidity is completely suppressed by disorder .",
    "the system undergoes the superfluid - insulator transition via an intermediate state , that may be called metallic .",
    "the high - frequency asymptotics of the optical conductivity in both phases follows the drude law with the damping parameter equal to @xmath71 , as can be seen from the limiting form of ( [ mlog ] ) . at the critical transition point , @xmath72 , the spectral weight of the condensate vanishes , and so does the gap frequency @xmath70 , while the memory function is @xmath73",
    "this obviously corresponds to the conventional drude optical conductivity with the dispersionless relaxation rate in the full spectral range .",
    "in this paper we have studied analytically the superfluid - glass transition within the purely two - dimensional bose gas with logarithmic interparticle interaction at @xmath0 k with static disorder , represented by the point - like random impurities .",
    "the dielectric properties of the system are considered proceeding from the explicit expression for the memory function @xmath39 , obtained within the mode - coupling theory .",
    "the onset of the glass phase manifests itself as the appearance of the nonergodicity pole @xcite of the memory function , @xmath74 .",
    "the above analysis shows , that the phase diagram of the model is delimited by the following combination of the physical parameters : @xmath75 untill @xmath62 , the optical conductivity @xmath76 spectrum consists of the response of the condensate @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the dirac delta function , and an inhomogeneously broadened feature at @xmath79 .",
    "the latter one is typical to the pinned density waves and falls off as @xmath80 at large frequencies .    at @xmath64",
    "the dirac delta function contribution disappears and the system undergoes the transition to a localized phase .",
    "hence , large value of either the boson effective mass @xmath7 , the amplitude of the impurity potential @xmath35 or the concentration of impurities @xmath32 , other parameters being fixed , favours the localization and suppresses the superfluid phase , while strong boson interparticle repulsion @xmath53 and large boson concentration @xmath6 have an opposite effect .",
    "a natural question arises on the internal structure of the novel localized phase . within the present hydrodynamic approach this problem",
    "can not be resolved on the microscopic level .",
    "qualitatively , the phase transition may be realized as a condensate fragmentation in the rugged potential landscape , that entails the breakdown of the long range non - diagonal order .",
    "the system breaks up into the patches , trapped by the randomly distributed pinning centers . by analogy with the mode - coupling theory of simple liquids , where the similar transition is referred to as the liquid - glass transition",
    ", we call the localized phase of the present model the bose - glass phase ( see also @xcite , where this name was first introduced ) .",
    "now , let us dwell in more details on the comparison of our results with some other approaches to the localization and superfluid - insulator transition in a system of 2d bosons . in ref.@xcite",
    "the phase diagram of the disordered 2d bose liquid is discussed in terms of two dimensionless parameters , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the zero point energy of the bosons , @xmath14 measures their short - range repulsion and @xmath84 is a disorder parameter .",
    "it was found , that large value of @xmath81 favours the superfluid ( sf ) phase , while the decreas of @xmath81 or the increase of @xmath82 leads to the localization and the supression of sf phase . in our case",
    "the only parameter @xmath47 , eq.([lamda ] ) , governs the phase diagram .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 , that enters therein may be understood as the concentration of bosons per a patch around an impurity .",
    "thus , the first factor in @xmath47 is proportional to the inverse energy per boson in such a patch @xcite , @xmath86 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 may be written in terms of ref.@xcite as : @xmath87 .",
    "it can be seen , that the increase of @xmath47 , that describes the gradual supression of sf phase and the onset of the localization , qualitatively agrees with the mentioned general results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the problem of the relevance of the model to the realistic physical systems is subtle , since the real particles , either boson or fermions , are likely to interact via not logarithmic , but rather the screened coulomb potential .",
    "however , the effective model of 2d bose liquid with the logarithmic interaction at @xmath0 is related to the physics of the pinned vortices in the bulk type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "we do not scrutinize this question any further in the present article .",
    "we believe the model considered to be of importance on its own right , as it exhibits a rather non - trivial behaviour and allows a fully analytic treatment . the comparison of our results with those , obtained for the other model of the disordered bose systems numerically and semi - analytically within the same theoretical framework @xcite , leads to the conclusion , that in both cases the phase diagram and the optical spectra are essentially the same and are fairly weakly sensitive to the character of the interparticle interaction , the impurity potential and the dimensionality of the systems .",
    "thus , we hope the present study may shed light on the behaviour of more realistic models , that do not permit such an elementary analysis ."
