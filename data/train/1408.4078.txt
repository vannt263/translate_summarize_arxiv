    "in condensed matter , especially when containing heavy ions , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) leads to phenomena that are lacking without soc .",
    "examples of recent interest include the original topological insulators,@xcite behavior arising from the rashba effect , unconventional metal - insulating transitions , compensating spin and orbital moments,@xcite and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) that is so important in spintronics applications . whereas soc within a @xmath6 manifold in a @xmath11o@xmath12 octahedron ( @xmath11 = transition metal ) has a long history@xcite and has been intensively discussed recently in several specific contexts,@xcite corresponding effects in an @xmath4 manifold",
    "have rarely been considered due to the conventional wisdom that the @xmath4 subshell ensures a perfectly quenched orbital moment . from this viewpoint ,",
    "heavy transition metal oxides containing @xmath11o@xmath1 tetrahedra are of great interest , since crystal field splitting leads to partially filled orbitals in the @xmath4 manifold .    about a century ago",
    ", monoclinic crystals of two toxic , volatile materials , oso@xmath1 and ruo@xmath1 , were synthesized .",
    "these are presumably textbook band insulators , albeit with remarkably high ( 8 + ) formal charges .",
    "although existing data on these crystals are limited , the effects of soc have been investigated from a chemical viewpoint since the 1990s@xcite and have been generally found to be minor . in 1985 ,",

    "who determined they formed in the tetragonal scheelite crystal structure.@xcite koso@xmath1   has been often synthesized from a mixture of ko@xmath14 and os metal as a precursor for preparation of the superconductor kos@xmath14o@xmath12,@xcite but further investigations of its physical properties are still lacking .",
    "koso@xmath1   seems to be insulating , though detailed resistivity data are not yet available.@xcite    recently , yamaura and collaborators determined the crystal structure parameters and measured the susceptibility and specific heat.@xcite the curie - weiss moment is @xmath15 = 1.44@xmath10 , 20% reduced from the spin - only moment , and the nel temperature is @xmath16 = 37 k. these authors suggested that magnetic frustration in this distorted diamond lattice may be necessary to account for observations .",
    "however , the conventional ratio of curie - weiss to ordering temperatures @xmath17 1.8 is small ( i.e. , there is little frustration in the bipartite os sublattice ) so other factors must be considered .    in this paper",
    "we study the electronic structure of koso@xmath1 , with special attention given to the interplay between strong correlation and soc .",
    "the small ligand field splitting of the @xmath4 orbitals due to distortion of the oso@xmath1 tetrahedron plays an important role in determining the occupied orbital in the mott - insulating state , and may become active in effects arising from soc as well .",
    "a modest @xmath6-@xmath4 crystal field splitting ( @xmath5 = 1.7 ev ) and large soc strength ( @xmath180.3 ev ) bring in another effect of crystallinity that impacts the effects of soc .",
    "this splitting is especially small considering that in another os@xmath7 compound , the double perovskite ba@xmath14naoso@xmath12 , @xmath5 = 6 ev is extremely large.@xcite results are analyzed in terms of magnetization densities , wannier functions , and spin - orbital occupation numbers .",
    "symmetry reduction of the electronic state due to soc when the spin lies in the [ 100 ] direction is found to have a great consequence : a population imbalance of the @xmath19 orbitals leads to an unexpectedly large orbital moment , as discussed in sec .",

    "the os sublattice forms a substantially elongated diamond sublattice ; this @xmath24 ratio is unity for the cubic diamond lattice .",

    "a similar distortion is observed in the band insulator oso@xmath1,@xcite while both ruo@xmath1 and kruo@xmath1 have nearly ideal tetrahedra.@xcite this difference suggests that the distortion is due to a chemical difference between os and ru ions .",
    "our calculations were carried out with the local ( spin ) density approximation [ l(s)da ] and its extensions , as implemented in the accurate all - electron full - potential code wien.@xcite since we are interested in a possible competition between large soc and strong correlation effects in magnetic systems , we compare all of the lda , lsda , lsda+soc , lsda+@xmath0 , and lsda+@xmath0+soc approaches . an effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 was used for the lda+@xmath0 calculations ; since os@xmath7 is a @xmath32 ion which is not occupied by more than one electron , the hund s rule coupling @xmath33 between two electrons of the same spin was set to zero . to analyze the partially filled os complex",
