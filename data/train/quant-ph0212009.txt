    "during the last few decades a huge deal of attention has been devoted to the study of the quantum dynamics of dissipative systems .",
    "the theory of open quantum systems , indeed , is essential for the understanding of a variety of physical phenomena in different fields of physics , such as , for example , quantum optics and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , very recently , there has been an increasing interest in the effects of decoherence , due to the unavoidable coupling with external environment@xcite , on the dynamics of quasi - closed systems used for quantum computing and quantum information processing .",
    "the usual approach for studying decoherence and dissipation effects starts by prescribing a total hamiltonian for the closed total system ( system+reservoir ) .",
    "then , after tracing over the reservoir variables and performing , if necessary , appropriate approximations , one finally derives a master equation ruling the dynamics of the dissipative quantum system .",
    "one of the most commonly done assumptions for describing open quantum systems is the so - called born - markov approximation which basically consists in neglecting memory effects of the reservoir . in other words",
    "one assumes that the correlation time of the reservoir , characterizing the time scale on which the reservoir memory would feed back to the system , is much shorter than the typical system time scale .",
    "when such condition is satisfied it is possible to derive a master equation describing the time evolution of the dissipative system for times longer than the correlation time of the reservoir . under this approximation the resulting master equation is called markovian master equations and of course does not describe appropriately systems interacting with natural or engineered structured reservoirs , such as atoms decaying in photonic band gap materials or atom lasers .",
    "it has been very recently demonstrated by ahn _",
    "_ @xcite that non - markovian reservoirs may be of potential interest for quantum information processing since a quantum system is decohered slower in a non - markovian reservoir than in a markovian one .    in this paper",

    "this is usually the case for typical reservoir spectra and parameters , as we have discussed in @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that starting from a fv coupling or from a rw coupling of an harmonic oscillator with a thermal reservoir it is possible to obtain a generalized master equation local in time describing the dynamics of the oscillator .",
    "this fact is not surprising . indeed , as underlined by paz and zurek in @xcite , perturbative master equations can always be shown to be local in time .",
    "it is worth noting that , as far as the fv interaction model is concerned , an exact master equation , valid for every value of the coupling strength , has been derived @xcite .",
    "the master equations we have derived in the paper are based on the weak coupling assumption but do not rely on the born - markov approximation so we are able to examine the non - markovian short time behavior of the system under study . in addition",
    "such equations of course describe the correct markovian long time asymptotic behavior @xcite .    the different structure of the two master equations given by eq . and",
    "eq . , traceable back to the two different coupling hamiltonians , are responsible for the occurrence of some physically transparent changes in the oscillator dynamics , more marked in short time regime .    to better understand the physical origin of such differences let us have a closer look at the two interaction hamiltonians :    @xmath112    @xmath113\\ ] ]    we take advantage of a pictorial representation of the four different interaction terms appearing in hamiltonian ( see fig [ diagra ] ) .",
    "the events represented in the first two diagrams ( a , b ) are processes of absorption or emission in which energy is conserved . the last two diagrams ( c , d ) , on the contrary ,",
    "describe events not corresponding to real absorption and emission processes . for this reason",
    "such processes are called _ virtual processes_. in the second order in perturbation theory both the two real and virtual processes combine to give rise to real processes hereafter called alpha and beta processes respectively ( see fig.[2ndorder ] ) .",
    "thus when we use the feynman - vernon coupling instead of the rotating wave one , the channels through which the oscillator exchanges energy with the reservoir are doubled .",
    "the asymptotic long time behavior describes , of course , thermalization in both cases .",
    "these particular features give rise to different predictions of the short time behavior of physical quantities , such as for example the mean number of quanta @xmath114 of the system oscillator ( heating function ) , depending on which of the two system - reservoir coupling models is used .",

    "this fact can be easily traced back to the doubling of channels for energy exchange illustrated in fig .",

    "such quantity is usually estimated from the experiments @xcite .",
    "if we now assume that experiments may be performed in all the relevant time scale , that is both in the asymptotic long time regime and in the non  markovian short time regime , one can use the value of the coupling constant experimentally measured in the asymptotic long time regime ( see eq . ) to verify if the correct short time behavior is actually the one predicted by eq .",

    "very often one deals with situations in which the characteristic frequency of the system @xmath0 is smaller or much smaller than the reservoir frequency cut @xmath139 . under this circumstances ,",
    "normally , we can not rely on the short time expressions of the fv coefficients @xmath127 and @xmath128 since they are valid for times @xmath152",
    ". however , there are two cases in which one can use the master equation given by eq . to describe correctly the non - markovian short time behavior of the system :    1 .   whenever one wants to look at situations in which @xmath153 , as discussed for example in @xcite ; 2",
    "whenever we are interested in the mean value of a certain class of observables , like for instance the number operator @xmath154 ( see @xcite ) .    in this last case , indeed , it has been shown @xcite that , in the weak coupling limit , it is equivalent to use the solution of the the master equations or since they lead to the the same analytic expressions for the expectation value of the observable of the class before mentioned .",
    "we have described a procedure , based on superoperator formalism , to derive , in the weak coupling limit , non  markovian generalized master equations local in time .",
    "such a method is equivalent to the time ",
    "convolutionless projection operator technique in the sense that it leads to the same generalized master equation .",
    "we apply this procedure to derive the master equation for a specific system , namely a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal reservoir at @xmath73 temperature .",
    "we compare two different microscopic system  reservoir coupling models : the feynman  vernon and the rotating wave couplings .",
    "both couplings are bilinear , but the first one is more general and thus , in this sense , it is more fundamental . very often however , in quantum optics systems , the rotating wave coupling is used because the counter rotating terms not conserving the unperturbed energy can not contribute to the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main result of our paper is to establish under which conditions such a claim is effectively correct . by comparing the analytic solutions of the heating function relative to the two different coupling models ( fv and rw couplings ) we conclude that , even in the weak coupling limit , the counter rotating terms give indeed a significant contribution in the non  markovian short time regime .",
    "such a contribution is actually experimentally measurable , provided that one can perform experiments in all the time scale relevant for the system dynamics . to this purpose",
    "it is worth noting that in the context of trapped ions experiments have been performed in which the system ( single harmonic oscillator ) is first cooled down to its zero point energy and then coupled to a properly engineered reservoir @xcite .",
    "we note that , in such experiments , it is possible not only to choose at will the reservoir parameters , but also to engineer the coupling and control the coupling strength .",
    "therefore , the great experimental advances of the trapped ion techniques could make it possible to perform an experiment aimed at proving the relevant role , in the short time dynamics , of the usually neglected counter rotating terms .",
    "one of the reasons for which one usually prefers to work with master equations derived starting from the rw coupling model is related to the fact that the resulting master equation , in the born ",
    "markov approximation , is in the lindblad form differently from the case in which the feynman ",
    "vernon coupling is assumed ( see master equation for brownian motion ) .",
    "we have demonstrated here that also the non  markovian master equation obtained starting from the rw coupling is in the lindblad form , for some value of the relevant system and reservoir parameter .",
    "moreover , by looking at the analytic expression of the time dependent coefficients of our non ",

    "remembering that the master equations given by eqs . and are of lindblad type when their time dependent coefficients are positive , indeed , it is not difficult to convince oneself that such conditions are simply related to the change of the sign of the coefficients",
    ". therefore the form of the rw master equations derived in this paper allows to study the border separating two very different physical regimes characterized by very different system dynamics @xcite and , for this reason , makes it possible to gain more insight in the fundamental dissipative processes of one of the most extensively studied physical systems : a harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal reservoir .",
    "another new result we have obtained in this paper stems from the comparison between the master equations derived in the following two cases :    \\1 ) feynman  vernon system reservoir coupling followed by the rwa performed after tracing over the reservoir degrees of freedom ;    \\2 ) rotating wave system reservoir coupling .",
    "stated another way we look at the differences in the system dynamics arising from the two following approximations respectively :    \\1 ) average over rapidly oscillating terms after tracing over the reservoir variables ;    \\2 ) neglecting the counter rotating terms in the initial microscopic coupling model .",
    "we have shown that the master equation obtained from the feynman ",
    "vernon coupling , after performing the rwa , is of the lindblad type and it actually has the same structure of the rw master equation , with different time dependent coefficients .",
    "we have demonstrated that these two different approximations lead to different short time behaviors , while in the asymptotic long time markovian regime the two correspondent master equations do coincide .",
    "however we have proved that performing the rwa after tracing over the reservoir variables is a less restrictive approximation than starting with the rw coupling model . indeed , differently from the rw master equation , the feynman ",
    "vernon one + rwa , takes into account the virtual photon exchanges relevant in the short time dynamics and thus it predicts the correct non ",

    "in this appendix we present the superoperatorial mathematical properties allowing to derive the final form of the fv master equation , given by eq .",

    "in this appendix we underline the essential steps in the derivation of the rw master equation given by eq . .",
