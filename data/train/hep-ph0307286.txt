    "the radiative decays of vector mesons into two neutral pseudoscalar mesons are expected to be useful to resolve the puzzles of the scalar mesons such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . among the possible decays of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the snd experiments @xcite recently reported the first measurement for the @xmath12 decay and confirmed the gams experiment @xcite for the @xmath1 decay with higher accuracy .",
    "the measured branching ratios are @xmath13    theoretically , since the pioneering works of singer @xcite based on the vector meson dominance , various models have been developed so far .",
    "the decay widths were estimated in the scheme of current algebra @xcite or with su(3 ) chiral lagrangian @xcite",
    ". for @xmath14 decays at the tree level , one considers the two diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig : types ] , i.e. , either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the intermediate meson .",
    "since the lowest pseudoscalar mesons are not allowed in the intermediate state , an important contribution is expected to come from the vector meson channel , i.e. , when @xmath18 or @xmath4 .",
    "however , the estimate  @xcite based on the vector meson dominance , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , gives too small decay widths for both decays compared with the experimental data .",
    "the momentum - dependent decay width of the intermediate vector meson and the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing are found to improve the situation only slightly  @xcite . in particular , for the @xmath12 decay , these effects are almost negligible .",
    "in addition to the tree level decay process , final state interactions can contribute to the decay amplitudes .",
    "specifically the radiative decays of vector mesons into two pseudoscalar mesons offer a possibility to study the final state interactions in a given hadronic channel and they are expected to shed light on the investigation of the scalar mesons . in ref .",

    "_ applied chiral perturbation theory to estimate the contribution from pion and kaon loops in @xmath21 at the one - loop level .",
    "they found that , when the pion loop is included , @xmath22 becomes doubled , which is however still lower than the experimental value , and @xmath23 remains almost unaltered .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy with the experimental data persists and further improvements are necessary .    for @xmath24 , the intermediate @xmath6 meson contribution could be important .",
    "the first attempt in this direction was made in the framework of unitarized chiral loops @xcite , where the @xmath25 meson is dynamically generated from the unitary resummation of the pion loops .",
    "this approach , which corresponds to the process @xmath26 , could lead to a good agreement with the recent data for the @xmath27 decay width .",
    "alternatively , one may introduce the @xmath25 meson explicitly in an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the initial calculation of the @xmath25 meson contribution using direct @xmath28 coupling  @xcite however overestimates the measured @xmath29 by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this unrealistic result is later ascribed  @xcite to the large and momentum - independent @xmath28 coupling ( @xmath30 ) determined from the analyses of @xmath4 meson photoproduction near threshold @xcite or by qcd sum rules @xcite . for the magnitude of the @xmath28 coupling ,",
    "the snd experiment extracted @xmath31 in a _ model - dependent _ way @xcite , which leads to a small coupling @xmath32 @xcite . moreover",
    ", the recent study on @xmath4 photoproduction at low energies @xcite shows that the @xmath25 exchange model with large @xmath33 can be successfully replaced by the @xmath3 tensor meson and two - pion exchanges .",
    "this example also suggests that the @xmath28 coupling is not necessarily large to explain the @xmath4 photoproduction data near threshold . for the momentum - dependence of the @xmath28 coupling , bramon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the linear sigma model , where the direct @xmath28 coupling is not allowed .",
    "instead , the @xmath25 couples to @xmath34 through chiral loops , which then gives an effective ( and momentum - dependent ) @xmath28 coupling  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results show strong dependence on the mass and the decay width of the @xmath25 meson @xcite so that the @xmath12 decay process may constrain such parameters .",
    "although the @xmath25 meson contribution could give a reasonable description for the @xmath27 decay width , the @xmath35 process still waits for an improvement .",
    "this is because the chiral loop and the intermediate @xmath25 meson give only negligible corrections to @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath25 meson couples to @xmath36 through a charged - pion loop but the @xmath37 vertex violates the @xmath38 parity .",
    "the charged kaon loops can contribute but its magnitude is estimated to be three orders of magnitude smaller than that from the vector meson dominance model @xcite .",
    "another approach is therefore developed by allowing the direct @xmath39 coupling  @xcite , which however needs further theoretical justifications in the viewpoint of the linear sigma model as the coupling occurs only through the chiral loops .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to look for additional mechanisms that can mostly contribute to the @xmath35 decay .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the role driven by the other mesons with spin 1 and 2 that have not been accounted for in the processes , @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",

    "<S> when the @xmath3 contribution is combined with the processes involving the vector and scalar meson intermediate states , a good agreement with the recent measurements is achieved for both decays . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the @xmath2 is found to be sizable at the intermediate photon energies and may be verified by precise measurements of the recoil photon spectrum of the @xmath1 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the decay widths on various models for the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing in the literature is also investigated . </S>"
