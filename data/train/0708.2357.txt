    "soliton and hairy black hole solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory and its variants have been the subject of extensive research since the discovery of non - trivial , spherically symmetric solitons @xcite and ` colored ' black holes @xcite in @xmath5 eym in asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "these black holes are ` hairy ' in the sense that they have no magnetic charge , and are therefore indistinguishable at infinity from a standard schwarzschild black hole .",
    "there are discrete families of solutions , indexed by the event horizon radius @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 for solitons ) and @xmath8 , the number of zeros of the single gauge field function @xmath9 , each pair @xmath10 identifying a solution of the field equations .",
    "a key feature of the solutions is that @xmath11 , so that the gauge field function must have at least one zero ( or ` node ' ) .",
    "these solutions , while they violate the ` letter ' of the no - hair conjecture , may be thought of as not contradicting its ` spirit ' , since they are found to be unstable to classical , linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite .",
    "there is also a large literature concerning analytic studies of the asymptotically flat @xmath5 eym field equations @xcite , proving the existence of the above numerical solutions and detailed properties of the phase space of solutions . since these initial discoveries a plethora of new soliton and black hole solutions have been found ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the present work combines two natural extensions of these initial studies : the generalization to @xmath0 eym , and the inclusion of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we now briefly review each of these generalizations in turn .",
    "firstly , in asymptotically flat space , both charged and neutral numerical solutions of the @xmath0 eym field equations have been found @xcite .",
    "we consider in this paper only purely magnetic solutions , which , in the asymptotically flat case , are described by @xmath2 gauge field functions @xmath12 . as in asymptotically flat @xmath5 eym , solutions exist at discrete points in the parameter space , and can be indexed by the radius of the event horizon ( if there is one ) and the number of nodes of the @xmath12 ( all @xmath12 having at least one zero ) .",
    "once again , there is a general result @xcite that all these solutions must be unstable .",
    "the @xmath0 eym field equations are considerably more complicated than those for @xmath5 and correspondingly less analytic work has been done .",
    "local existence of solutions of the field equations near the origin ( for solitons ) , black hole event horizon ( if there is one ) and at infinity has been established @xcite .",
    "there is a heuristic proof ( following @xcite ) of the existence of black hole solutions for general @xmath13 @xcite , but more rigorous work exits only for the case of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the second generalization of asymptotically flat @xmath5 eym that we consider in this paper is the inclusion of a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath14 .",
    "when the cosmological constant is positive , soliton @xcite and black hole @xcite",
    "@xmath5 solutions have been found .",
    "these solutions possess a cosmological horizon and approach de sitter space at infinity ( for a complete classification of the possible space - time structures , see @xcite ) .",
    "the phase space of solutions is again discrete , and the single gauge field function @xmath9 must have at least one zero .",
    "unsurprisingly , these solutions again turn out to be unstable @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a negative cosmological constant ( so that the space - time is asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) ) may be motivated by recent progress in string theory , particularly the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it is found @xcite that the solutions of @xmath5 eym in ads possess quite different properties compared with their asymptotically flat or asymptotically de sitter cousins .",
    "in particular , solutions for which the gauge field function @xmath9 has no zeros exist for sufficiently large @xmath15 .",
    "solutions exist in continuous open subsets of the parameter space , rather than at discrete points .",
    "in addition , for sufficiently large @xmath15 , at least some of these solutions are stable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite ( this was subsequently extended to cover non - spherically symmetric linear perturbations in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , while black holes can not be given stable ym hair in either asymptotically flat or asymptotically de sitter space , in asymptotically anti - de sitter space , stable gauge field hair is possible .",
    "we are thus led to the following natural question : are there stable solutions of the @xmath0 eym solutions with a negative cosmological constant ? in this paper we will present the first soliton and hairy black hole solutions of @xmath0 eym in ads , for @xmath16 .",
    "we consider only purely magnetic gauge fields , so that the ym field is described by @xmath2 functions @xmath12 .",
    "we make a detailed study of the phase space of solutions and their general properties in the particular cases @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "of particular interest is the existence , for sufficiently large @xmath15 , of solutions in which all the @xmath12 have no zeros .",
    "we anticipate that at least some of these solutions will be stable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations , and will examine their stability in detail elsewhere .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : equations ] we discuss the field equations , our ansatze for the fields and the boundary conditions that must be satisfied , considering the cases of black holes and solitons separately .",
    "our new solutions are discussed in detail in section [ sec : solutions ] , focussing particularly on the phase space of solutions .",
    "finally , our conclusions can be found in section [ sec : conc ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "the metric has signature @xmath19 and we use units in which @xmath20 .",
    "we consider static , spherically symmetric , four - dimensional solitons and black holes with metric @xmath21 where the metric functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend on the radial co - ordinate @xmath24 only . in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xmath25 ,",
    "we write the metric function @xmath22 as @xmath26 the most general , spherically symmetric , ansatz for the @xmath0 gauge potential is @xcite : @xmath27 \\ , d\\phi , \\label{eq : gaugepot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are all @xmath32 matrices and @xmath33 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath30 . the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are purely imaginary , diagonal , traceless and depend only on the radial co - ordinate @xmath24 .",
    "the matrix @xmath30 is upper - triangular , with non - zero entries only immediately above the diagonal : @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 is a constant matrix : @xmath36 here we consider only purely magnetic solutions , so we set @xmath37 .",
    "we may also take @xmath38 by a choice of gauge @xcite . from now on we will assume that all the @xmath39 are non - zero ( see , for example , @xcite for the possibilities in asymptotically flat space if this assumption does not hold )",
    ". in this case one of the yang - mills equations becomes @xcite @xmath40 our ansatz for the yang - mills potential therefore reduces to @xmath41 \\ , d\\phi , \\label{eq : gaugepotsimple}\\ ] ] where the only non - zero entries of the matrix @xmath30 are @xmath42 the gauge field",
    "is therefore described by the @xmath2 functions @xmath39 .",
    "we comment that our ansatz ( [ eq : gaugepotsimple ] ) is by no means the only possible choice in @xmath0 eym .",
    "techniques for finding _ all _ spherically symmetric @xmath0 gauge potentials can be found in @xcite , where all irreducible models are explicitly listed for @xmath43 .    with the ansatz ( [ eq : gaugepotsimple ] ) , there are @xmath2 non - trivial yang - mills equations for the @xmath2 functions @xmath12 : @xmath44 for @xmath35 , where a prime @xmath45 denotes @xmath46 , @xmath47 , \\label{eq : ptheta } \\\\",
    "w_j&= & 1-\\omega^2_j+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\omega^2_{j-1}+\\omega^2_{j+1}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath48 .",
    "the einstein equations take the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 altogether , then , we have @xmath1 ordinary differential equations for the @xmath1 unknown functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath39 .",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath53 for each @xmath54 independently , and also under the substitution : @xmath55      the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) are singular at the origin @xmath56 ( for regular , soliton solutions ) , the black hole event horizon @xmath57 ( if there is one ) and at infinity @xmath58 .",
    "we therefore now discuss the boundary conditions that must be satisfied by the field variables at these singular points .",
    "local existence of solutions of the field equations in neighborhoods of these singular points will be rigorously proved elsewhere @xcite , generalizing the local existence proofs in the asymptotically flat case @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions satisfied by black hole solutions are more easily stated , so we consider those first .",
    "we assume there is a regular , non - extremal , black hole event horizon at @xmath57 , where @xmath59 has a single zero .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath60 to be : @xmath61 the field variables @xmath39 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 will have regular taylor series expansions about @xmath57 : @xmath62 setting @xmath63 in the yang - mills equations ( [ eq : yme ] ) fixes the derivatives of the gauge field functions at the horizon : @xmath64 therefore the expansions ( [ eq : horizon ] ) are determined by the @xmath1 quantities @xmath65 , @xmath6 , @xmath66 for fixed cosmological constant @xmath14 . for the event horizon to be non - extremal , it must be the case that @xmath67 which weakly constrains the possible values of the gauge field functions @xmath68 at the event horizon .",
    "since the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) are invariant under the transformation ( [ eq : omegaswap ] ) , we may consider @xmath69 without loss of generality .    at infinity ,",
    "the boundary conditions are considerably less stringent than in the asymptotically flat case . in order for the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) to be asymptotically ads",
    ", we simply require that the field variables @xmath39 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 converge to constant values as @xmath58 , and have regular taylor series expansions in @xmath70 near infinity : @xmath71 since @xmath25 , there is no cosmological horizon .",
    "soliton solutions have the same boundary conditions ( [ eq : infinity ] ) as @xmath58 as black hole solutions . the boundary conditions at a regular origin , however , are considerably more complicated than at a black hole event horizon or at infinity . for the asymptotically flat case ,",
    "they have been derived in @xcite . as may be expected , the modifications required by the presence of a non - zero cosmological constant are not great . however , given the complexity of these boundary conditions , we now describe their derivation in some detail .",
    "we begin by assuming a regular taylor series expansion for all field variables near @xmath56 : @xmath72 where the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants .",
    "the expansions ( [ eq : origin1 ] ) are substituted into the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) to determine the values of the constants .",
    "the constant @xmath76 is non - zero in order for the metric to be regular at the origin , but otherwise arbitrary since the field equations involve only derivatives of @xmath23 .",
    "regularity of the metric and curvature at the origin immediately gives : @xmath77 and @xmath78 without loss of generality ( due to ( [ eq : omegaswap ] ) ) , we take the positive square root in ( [ eq : omegaorigin ] ) .",
    "examination of the leading order terms in the yang - mills equations ( [ eq : yme ] ) gives the following constraint on @xmath79 : @xmath80    here , @xmath81 is the @xmath82 matrix @xmath83 therefore @xmath84 is an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath85 if one exists , otherwise @xmath86 .",
    "to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath81 , we first note that it can be written in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88    then the matrices @xmath81 and @xmath89 have the same eigenvalues , and the eigenvectors of @xmath81 can be deduced from those of @xmath89 .",
    "this result is useful because the matrix @xmath89 has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "there it is proved that the eigenvalues of @xmath89 ( and therefore those of @xmath81 ) are : @xmath90 the eigenvectors of @xmath89 in general involve hahn polynomials @xcite , and can be found explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath91 for @xmath92 will be presented in sections [ sec : su3solitons ] and [ sec : su4solitons ] when we discuss the soliton solutions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 eym , respectively .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a ( suitably normalized ) eigenvector of @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath85 , and @xmath95 is an arbitrary constant . from the einstein equations ( [ eq : ee ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are fixed and given in terms of the @xmath98 .",
    "expanding the gauge field functions @xmath12 to order @xmath99 has therefore only introduced one arbitrary parameter , namely @xmath95 .",
    "however , it is expected that @xmath2 independent parameters will be required to describe the @xmath2 independent functions @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we must work to higher order in @xmath24 in order to introduce more arbitrary parameters .",
    "considering the next order in the yang - mills equations ( [ eq : yme ] ) , and setting @xmath100 , we find @xmath101 so that we may set @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath104 is an eigenvector of @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath105 ( @xmath106 in ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) ) .",
    "the einstein equations ( [ eq : ee ] ) are then used to determine @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( which will also depend on the cosmological constant @xmath14 ) .",
    "since we require @xmath2 arbitrary parameters for the @xmath2 independent functions @xmath39 , the above analysis therefore suggests that we need to expand the @xmath39 up to @xmath109 in order to have @xmath2 arbitrary parameters in the expansion .",
    "this turns out to be the case , and a detailed proof will be given elsewhere @xcite . determining the @xmath110 for @xmath111 is slightly more complicated than for @xmath112 as outlined above .",
    "examining the yang - mills equation ( [ eq : yme ] ) to @xmath113th order , we find an equation for the @xmath114 of the following form @xmath115 { { \\mbox{{\\boldmath{{$\\omega $ } } } } } } _ { k+1 } = { { \\mbox{{\\boldmath{{$c$}}}}}}_{k+1 } \\label{eq : genomegak}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is a complicated vector depending on @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath119 , the form of @xmath116 is given explicitly in @xcite ; when @xmath120 there are minor modifications which we do not write here ( they will be given in @xcite ) . since , in later sections , we present solutions just for @xmath3 and @xmath4 eym , we will not need the exact form of the @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath91 is an eigenvector of @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath121 ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) , we can solve equation ( [ eq : genomegak ] ) for @xmath114 : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a particular solution of ( [ eq : genomegak ] ) chosen by requiring that @xmath123 is a linear combination of @xmath124 .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that there is a unique solution of ( [ eq : genomegak ] ) subject to this constraint , in the @xmath119 case .",
    "this can be extended to @xmath25 , but we do not present the lengthy details here @xcite .",
    "the upshot of all this analysis is that the expansion of the fields , near the origin , is written as follows ( where @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 where @xmath127 the expansions ( [ eq : origin ] ) give the field variables in terms of the @xmath2 parameters @xmath128 and are those which are used in the numerical integration of the field equations in the next section .",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) have the following trivial solutions .",
    "setting @xmath129 for all @xmath54 gives the schwarzschild - ads black hole with @xmath130 ( which can be set to zero to give pure ads space ) .",
    "setting @xmath131 for all @xmath54 gives the reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole with metric function @xmath132 and magnetic charge @xmath133 given by @xmath134 there is an additional special class of solutions , given by setting @xmath135 in this case , we follow @xcite and define @xmath136 and then rescale the field variables as follows : @xmath137 note that we rescale the cosmological constant @xmath14 ( this is not necessary in @xcite as there @xmath119 ) .",
    "the field equations satisfied by @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are then @xmath141 ; \\qquad \\frac { 1}{{\\tilde { s } } } \\frac { d{\\tilde { s}}}{dr }   = - \\frac { 2{\\tilde { g}}}{r } ; \\nonumber \\\\ 0 & = & r^{2 } \\mu \\frac { d^{2}{\\tilde { \\omega } } } { dr^{2 } } + \\left [ 2{\\tilde { m } } - 2r^{3 } { \\tilde { p}}_{\\theta } - \\frac { 2{\\tilde { \\lambda } } r^{3}}{3 } \\right ] \\frac { d{\\tilde { \\omega } } } { dr } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ 1 - { \\tilde { \\omega } } ^{2 } \\right ] { \\tilde { \\omega } } , \\label{eq : su2equations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we now have @xmath142 and @xmath143 the equations ( [ eq : su2equations ] ) are precisely the @xmath5 eym field equations .",
    "furthermore , the boundary conditions ( [ eq : horizon],[eq : infinity],[eq : origin ] ) also become those for the @xmath5 case .",
    "this is straightforward to see for the boundary conditions at the horizon ( [ eq : horizon ] ) or at infinity ( [ eq : infinity ] ) .",
    "at the origin ( [ eq : origin ] ) , the @xmath5 embedded solutions are given by @xmath144 , but @xmath145 .",
    "therefore any @xmath5 , asymptotically ads , eym soliton or black hole solution can be embedded into @xmath0 eym to give another asymptotically ads soliton or black hole .",
    "we will see later in this section how the embedded @xmath5 solutions fit in the solution spaces for larger @xmath13 .    to find genuinely @xmath0 solutions , the field equations ( [ eq : yme],[eq : ee ] ) are integrated numerically using standard ` shooting ' techniques @xcite .",
    "the equation for @xmath52 decouples from the other einstein equation and the yang - mills equations so can be integrated separately if required . for @xmath146 solutions , we therefore have @xmath13 coupled ordinary differential equations to integrate ( @xmath2 yang - mills equations and one einstein equation ) . for black holes , we start integrating just outside the event horizon , using as our shooting parameters the @xmath13 variables @xmath65 , @xmath6 , subject to the weak constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) . for solitons ,",
    "we start integrating close to the origin , using as our shooting parameters the @xmath147 variables @xmath148 ( [ eq : origin ] ) . in the soliton case , there are no _ a priori _ bounds on the parameters @xmath148 . in either case , the field equations are then integrated outwards in the radial co - ordinate @xmath24 until either the field variables start to diverge or they have converged to the asymptotic form at infinity .",
    "we now turn to a detailed discussion of the solutions we find . as well as presenting some examples of solutions , our particular focus in this section will be the structure of the space of solutions , as a subset of the phase space of parameters characterizing the solutions .",
    "we will examine the solution spaces in detail for @xmath3 and @xmath4 solitons and black holes , focusing on the numbers of zeros of the gauge field functions .",
    "the solution spaces we present may not necessarily be complete , as our approach has been to scan the parameter space using a grid .",
    "it is therefore possible that solutions in which the gauge field functions have different numbers of zeros exist between the points of our grid .",
    "however , our figures will reveal the key features of the solution spaces .",
    "of particular interest will be the existence of solutions where all the gauge field functions have no zeros .",
    "we begin by reviewing the phase space of @xmath5 solutions , in which case we have a single gauge field function @xmath149 .",
    "many of the properties we find in the phase space of solutions for @xmath0 , @xmath16 are also seen in the @xmath5 case and so it is informative to examine this simpler situation first .      near the origin , one parameter , @xmath150 , is required , and the expansion ( [ eq : origin ] ) reduces to @xmath151 for solitons , the phase space has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "we have verified their results and the phase space is shown in figure [ fig : su2solitons ] ( note that our parameter @xmath150 in ( [ eq : su2solitonorigin ] ) is equal to @xmath152 in @xcite ) .",
    "the shaded area denotes those pairs @xmath153 ( where @xmath150 is the shooting parameter giving the form of the gauge field function @xmath9 near the origin ) for which no regular solution is found .",
    "the unshaded regions correspond to regular solutions , the number of nodes @xmath8 of the gauge field function @xmath9 being indicated for each region . for values of @xmath150 just below the region",
    "in which @xmath154 we found solutions for which @xmath155 , but the latter region is too small to be seen on the graph.,width=245 ]    the phase space is parameterized by just two quantities : the cosmological constant @xmath14 and the shooting parameter @xmath150 ( [ eq : su2solitonorigin ] ) .",
    "the shaded regions in figure [ fig : su2solitons ] indicate those values of the parameters for which we were unable to find a regular solution all the way out to infinity .",
    "where we do find solutions , they occur in open subsets of the plane .",
    "we label these open sets by @xmath8 , the number of zeros of the single gauge function @xmath9 .",
    "we draw the reader s attention to the following particular features of the soliton phase space :    1 .",
    "the number of zeros of the gauge field function increases as @xmath15 decreases or @xmath150 decreases .",
    "2 .   solutions in which @xmath9 has no zeros occur for sufficiently large @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   as @xmath15 decreases ,",
    "we find fewer solutions .",
    "the phase space breaks up into smaller and smaller regions . in the limit @xmath156 , we are left with solutions just at discrete points , which are the bartnik - mckinnon solitons in asymptotically flat space @xcite .",
    "note that the solution with @xmath157 exists for all @xmath14 , and simply corresponds to pure ads , with @xmath158 .",
    "we next turn to the phase space of @xmath5 black hole solutions .",
    "there are now three parameters describing the solutions , @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath159 . in order to plot two - dimensional figures ,",
    "we fix either @xmath6 or @xmath14 and vary the other two quantities . for @xmath5",
    "black holes , the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) on the value of the gauge field function at the event horizon reads @xmath160 whether we are varying @xmath6 or @xmath14 , we perform a scan over all values of @xmath161 which satisfy ( [ eq : su2bhconstraint ] ) .",

    "the following key features are apparent from figure [ fig : su2bh1 ] :    1 .",
    "we find solutions in which the gauge field function has more zeros as we decrease @xmath6 or @xmath159 .",
    "2 .   as @xmath168 , the constraint ( [ eq : su2bhconstraint ] ) implies that @xmath169 ,",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : su2bh1 ] .",
    "this is because the black hole solutions become solitons in this limit , and , for solitons , we have @xmath170 ( [ eq : su2solitonorigin ] ) .",
