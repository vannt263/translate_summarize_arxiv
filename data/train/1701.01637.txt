    "<S> we investigate the chemical bonding characteristics of the transition - metal dichalcogenides thanks to an analysis of the static and dynamical charges within the density functional theory framework . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical charges of the trigonal transition - metal dichalcogenides are found anomalous , while in their hexagonal counterparts , the sign of the dynamic charge is counterintuitive i.e. the transition - metal takes the negative dynamic charge . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that this phenomena can not be understood by analysis of the static charges and present our theoretical understanding of this phenomena based on the perturbative response of the system to a static electric field and by investigating the hybridization of the molecular - orbitals near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we establish a link between the sign of the born effective charge and the hybridization of the molecular - orbitals near the fermi and propose an experimental procedure to verify the calculated sign of the dynamical charge in the transition - metal dichalcogenides .    </S>",
    "<S> the expanding interest in the transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) stems from their wide variety of applications , ranging from batteries to electronic devices  @xcite . indeed , by adjusting either their chemical composition or the number of layers </S>",
    "<S> , one can tune their electronic , vibrational , and magnetic properties in a manner irreproducible by other two - dimensional and layered materials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the tmds offer high carrier mobilities  @xcite and a strain - dependent indirect to direct band gap transition  @xcite , that are crucial for future electronic and electro - optic applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , while the electronic properties of these materials are now relatively well - known  @xcite , the character of their chemical bonds is , to the best of our knowledge , not yet fully - understood . </S>",
    "<S> for example , while zrs@xmath0 is reported as extremely ionic  @xcite , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 are reported to possess both ionic and covalent characteristics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , tis@xmath0 was recently reported as metallic and semiconducting , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the bonding characteristics and charge transfer in the tmds thanks to density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one common way to estimate the static charge within this theory is to arbitrarily partition the electronic density of the system into constituent atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while conceptually simple , this notion of `` static '' charge is unfortunately ambiguous  @xcite and the corresponding charges can not be measured experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the dynamical charge , arising from the change of dipole moment due to an atomic perturbation , i.e. the born effective charge ( bec )  @xcite is a physical observable as it governs , for example , the splitting between the transverse optical ( to ) and longitudinal optical ( lo ) vibrational modes  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we highlight the critical differences between the dynamical becs and static bader charges in the cases of the hexagonal tmds ( h - tmds ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> our bec calculations indicate that the transition - metal atom takes the negative charge , while the nominal and computed static charges leads to the opposite conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts strongly with the case of the trigonal tmds ( t - tmds ) for which we find that the sign of the bader charge and bec agree . in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these fundamental discrepancies , and more importantly , explain the origin of the counterintuitive sign of the becs in the h - tmds by investigating the localization of the hybridized molecular - orbitals near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> we propose finally an experimental method to verify our theoretical observations .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are performed using the _ abinit _ software package  @xcite with the gga - pbe exchange - correlation functional  @xcite , corrected by grimme s dft - d3 functional for the dispersion corrections due to long range electron - electron correlations  @xcite . with the inclusion of this functional , we are able to reproduce the in - plane and out - of - plane experimental lattice parameters within 0.7@xmath1  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . details on the norm - conserving pseudopotentials , the convergence parameters ( plane - wave expansion cutoff energy and brillouin - zone sampling ) and the structural parameters is found in the supplemental material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the bader charge , @xmath2 , and bec , @xmath3 , for the bulk mx@xmath0 h - tmds , where m= mo , w and x= s , se , te , as well as for tis@xmath0 and tise@xmath0 , two semiconducting t - tmds . </S>",
    "<S> we use density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite to calculate the becs with the charge neutrality condition imposed . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations of the static and dynamic charges use the relaxed geometries for the individual compounds .    in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] , we report our calculated becs and bader charges for the previously introduced tmds , alongside experimental data extracted from infrared spectra  @xcite which only provides a measure of the magnitude of the bec . in terms of the magnitude of the bec , </S>",
    "<S> our calculated becs agree quantitatively with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the studied t - tmds , the becs are found anomalous as they differ strongly from both their corresponding nominal and static charges . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe that the dynamical charges in h - tmds are counterintuitive , with the transition - metal and chalcogen atoms taking the negative and positive charges , respectively , in disagreement with the corresponding nominal and static charges . these counterintuitive becs for h - tmds were also observed recently  @xcite , even for monolayer tmds , although the authors did not remark upon , or provide an explanation for the calculated sign . in the following , we will first discuss the discrepancies observed between the static and dynamical charges in the h - tmds , before explaining the physical origin of the counterintuitive sign of the becs .    </S>",

    "<S> namely , the static charge being calculated from a ground - state density partition and the dynamic charge being calculated as a response function . </S>",
    "<S> still , one can construct a dynamical charge based on the static charge , by taking into account of the change of bader charge with an atomic displacement  @xcite computed by finite differences . </S>",
    "<S> this newly - constructed dynamical charge , denoted @xmath10 includes additional effects i.e. the charge localization and delocalization but fails to account for the local change in polarization around the atoms . to avoid the creation of an electron current , which can not be quantified by our approach </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider atomic displacements in the out - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding charges are reported in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> while these dynamical charges are in better agreement with our computed becs , the additional contribution is found to be to small to explain fully the sign of the becs in h - tmds . </S>",
    "<S> we understand this in term of a local change of polarization around the atoms that can not be quantified by such an approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is furthermore confirmed by the analysis of the perturbed density with an atomic displacement , presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( s2 ) of the supplemental material  @xcite , that is localized closely to the mo atoms ( a region that can not be described by bader as discussed in the supplemental material  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the analysis of the becs is crucial to understanding the discrepancies in dynamical charges between h - tmds and t - tmds . </S>",
    "<S> we focus in the following on mos@xmath0 and tis@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the band - by - band decomposition  @xcite and localization tensor  @xcite are unable to bring any simple nor conclusive explanations on the difference of becs between these two materials as shown in table  ( s3 ) in the supplemental material .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is necessary to analyze the different contributions to the becs which are given explicitly , for example , in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting the separable part , the bec can be expressed in term of two contributions ; the first one , the ionic charge of the system , is static and always positive for the transition - metal atom . </S>",
    "<S> the second contribution , the dynamic correction corresponding to the effects of electronic screening , is responsible for the sign change observed here . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed discussion of these two terms is found in the supplementary material  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic screening component , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( s3 ) of the supplemental material  @xcite , depends explicitly on , first , the change in the electronic wavefunction due to an electric field perturbation and , second , the change of electronic potential due to an atomic displacement . while the change in potential does not vary qualitatively between mos@xmath0 and tis@xmath0 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 )  @xcite , their first - order density responses differ significantly , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ change_den ] . in mos@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , this change of electronic density with an external electric field is localized around the mo atom ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is this transfer which is responsible for the sign of the bec and the @xmath24 back - bonding . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the increase in the magnitude of the bec as a function of the chalcogen ( s , se , te ) , seen in table  [ tab1 ] , can be understood in terms of the increased weight of transition - metal atomic orbitals in this mo as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we show the mo diagram of tis@xmath0 using the notation of the d@xmath25 point group . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that all the valence bands of tis@xmath0 should contain a majority of atomic like s states , and that the last occupied band is the quadruply occupied e@xmath26 band . </S>",

    "<S> the bonding between mo and s is of two types : the bonding mo transfer charge from mo to s , as expected from electronegativity and intuition . </S>",

    "<S> this is known as @xmath24 back - bonding , a process in which a @xmath28 bond is formed with the expected charge transfer , then an additional @xmath24 orbital of a ligand ( here the chalcogen atoms ) transfers charge back to a d state of a transition metal atom  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamic bec sign change is a clear indicator of the subtle difference in bonding in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> a high - throughput screening of anomalous bec in many more materials is ongoing .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it will be difficult to determine the sign of the bec as most quantities , in particular the lo - to splitting , depend on the magnitude of the bec and not its sign . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the negative bec are a fundamental material property , they should be measurable , e.g. in a system where the mirror plane symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> a small movement of the transition - metal ion would then lead to an asymmetric effect as a function of applied fields or strain . </S>",
    "<S> there exists tmd materials with similar planes to h - tmds , but lower lattice symmetry due to stacking , in particular tcs@xmath0 , res@xmath0 , and rese@xmath0 which belong to triclinic space groups . </S>",

    "<S> we believe in these materials , and the others already mentioned , that the raman susceptibility can be used to determine the sign of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> the raman susceptibility is _ linearly _ dependent on the bec  @xcite and can be used to deduce the sign a bec in an angle resolved raman measurement similar to wolverson _ </S>",

    "<S> finally , it may also be possible to measure the inverted sign of the bec using using x - ray absorption spectroscopy in a strong electric field , which is atom - specific  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that , for h - tmd in a homogeneous field of any direction , half of the bonds will be stretched and the other half compressed , making it impossible to distinguish the bec sign .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the born effective charges in the hexagonal tmds are anomalous in sign . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the change in the electronic density due to an electric field perturbation , which is localized on the transition - metal ion . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the localization of the perturbed density arises from the bonding characteristics of the molecular orbitals , in which the highest occupied orbital is anti - bonding , with strong transition - metal characteristics . upon a displacement of either atom , the highest occupied @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> orbital will transfer more charge through @xmath24 back bonding . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is identical in monolayers of tmds , and in systems with hexagonal layers but broken stacking symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these results are the first observation of an anomalous sign in the bec , and confirm their powerful role in probing bonding characteristics in complex systems . the experimental determination of the sign of the bec is an important issue , for which we make a few suggestions . </S>"
