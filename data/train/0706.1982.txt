    "understanding the nature of the cosmological density perturbation is essential for the development of inflationary cosmology .",
    "recent years have seen a surge in the development of precision cosmology , with improved measurements of the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as well as increasingly accurate large scale structure ( lss ) surveys .",
    "the task of faithfully reconstructing the physics of inflation from this data is the central goal of inflationary phenomenology .",
    "the fundamental physics responsible for inflation remains elusive , however .",
    "models of inflation abound with motivations stemming from supergravity , the string landscape , d - branes , extensions to the standard model and others @xcite . a reliable reconstruction of the inflaton potential , and therefore the physics responsible for inflation , hinges on accurate measurement and subsequent analysis of cosmological data .",
    "there has been much progress in the development of methods of primordial power spectrum reconstruction @xcite , as well as methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential @xcite . with the recent release of the wmap3 data - set @xcite and with future cmb missions eminent @xcite ,",
    "it is both important and timely to investigate how well current and future experiments will be able to constrain the form of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "recent analyses report a nearly scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic , gaussian density perturbations , consistent with the simplest models of single field slow - roll inflation @xcite",
    ". however , experimental and theoretical inaccuracy , in addition to the limited detection of the polarization signal , limit parameter estimation efforts .",
    "the dominant source of error is that due to cosmic variance , a statistical uncertainty related to the fact that there is only one universe to observe .",
    "this effect is present in both temperature and polarization spectra and is most pronounced on large scales ( at low cmb multipoles ) .",
    "cosmic variance results in a fundamental limit on the resolution of cmb spectra , which restricts the accuracy with which we can reconstruct the physics of the early universe .",
    "since the primordial perturbation spectrum provides one of the few pieces of observational evidence for inflation , these uncertainties impose a limit on how well we can reconstruct the physics of the inflationary era .",
    "while single field slow - roll inflation is well supported by current data , it is of interest to determine whether more exotic inflationary scenarios might exist within the resolution limit of observational data .    in this paper",
    ", we study our current ability to constrain the form of the power spectrum . using the latest wmap data - set @xcite",
    ", we generate a best - fit base cosmological model characterized by 7 parameters , ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we are interested in identifying alternative models with more general power spectra that yield comparable fits to current data .",
    "such statistically degenerate models can be considered effectively indistinguishable , and differences in the underlying inflation models unresolvable . in order to test a wide range of spectral shapes ,",
    "we introduce a monte carlo reconstruction program that combines the inflationary flow technique @xcite with a numerical integration of the mode equations of quantum fluctuations . aside from being a novel reconstruction technique in its own right , we find it highly suitable for the present investigation .",
    "we use this method to stochastically generate an ensemble of power spectra to 6@xmath4-order in the flow space .",
    "for each spectrum it is possible reconstruct the exact inflaton potential . because we solve for the spectrum numerically , we can successfully reconstruct spectra arising from slow - roll as well as strongly non - slow - roll inflation models .",
    "additionally , the flow approach allows us to enforce that each model yield the appropriate amount of inflation , @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "for each spectrum , we fix the non - spectral parameters at the best - fit values and calculate the new model s likelihood .",
    "we establish a resolution criterion based on the relative likelihoods of the trial models and the best - fit model . by fixing the non - spectral parameters",
    ", we are not performing a bayesian analysis of the enlarged parameter space of flow parameters . by allowing all the parameters to vary as is done in bayesian parameter estimation ,",
    "it is possible that new parameter degeneracies would allow for a wider range of possible spectral shapes to be in agreement with the data ( see , for example , ref .",
    "our method therefore only samples a subset of possible spectra and should be viewed as a more conservative approach .",
    "this study is more akin to a model selection analysis : we attempt to identify models constructed from the inflationary flow space that are equally consistent with the data as models parameterized as simple power - laws .",
    "we utilize the p - value calculated from the model s chi - squared per degrees of freedom as a measure of statistical significance .",
    "this approach is frequentist in nature , yet we find general agreement with the bayesian study of @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the inflationary flow formalism and in section iii we introduce the new method which combines the flow approach with a numerical integration of the mode equation . in section",
    "iv we investigate primordial power spectrum resolution with the wmap3 data - set .",
    "we find that with tt / te / ee data alone , our ability to reconstruct the inflaton potential is strongly affected by the limited spectral resolution .",
    "we find that strongly running spectra arising from non - slow - roll inflation models are currently indistinguishable from a best - fit power - law model typical of slow - roll inflation . however , since these non - slow - roll models are typically accompanied by large tensor components , any information regarding the b - mode polarization signal will significantly improve resolvability .",
    "furthermore , we find that the established confidence limits on the tensor - to - scalar ratio obtained from sdss and wmap3 when running is included are violated by the non - power - law spectra identified in this study .",
    "we find spectra with values for @xmath1 at @xmath6 that lie outside the 2-@xmath2 contour of the @xmath7-@xmath1 marginalized likelihood @xcite yield _",

    "the main drawback of the flow method is that while generating exact inflationary evolutions , it must rely on approximations when calculating the observable predictions of these models .",

    "the red - colored inflation models that give rise to the red - colored non - power - law spectra are characterized by an initially _ fast - rolling _ inflaton that has failed to reach the slow - roll attractor by the time observable scales exit the horizon , similar to models proposed by contaldi , _ et al .",

    "we plot one such potential .",
    "the kinetic energy is initially large and monotonically decreasing with respect to time . from the equation of motion",
    "( [ kg ] ) , it is evident that if the field velocity is initially large , the hubble drag term @xmath158 dominates the evolution , slowing the field .",
    "the field decelerates until the drag term becomes subdominant near the end of inflation .",
    "in contrast , the kinetic energy of the best - fit power - law model ( not included in the figure ) is @xmath159 and is a monotonically increasing function of time .",
    "we conclude that current cmb data does not allow for a precise reconstruction of the inflationary power spectrum and the corresponding inflaton dynamics .",
    "in particular , we find a statistical degeneracy amongst slow - roll and non - slow - roll models .",
    "the span of the degeneracy envelope in figure [ figure1 ] is largely shaped by our inability to constrain @xmath1 , with models exhibiting the strongest deviation from power - law also predicting values of @xmath1 an order of magnitude larger than the fiducial model .",
    "future cmb missions @xcite with the ability to detect the b - mode polarization signal characteristic of gravitational radiation will put tighter constraints on @xmath1 @xcite , reducing or breaking the @xmath1-@xmath7 degeneracy and significantly improving primordial power spectrum resolution .",
    "we have investigated the ability of current data to constrain the form of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the ability of the data to resolve the power spectrum can be tested by how well it singles out a best - fit model . starting with the latest wmap release",

    ", we turn to monte carlo reconstruction .",
    "we combine the flow formalism , which is a method of stochastic model generation , with a numerical integration of the mode equations of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this allows us to handle inflation models that yield spectra that are not well described by the standard spectral parameterization . for each spectrum thus generated",
    ", we fix the non - spectral parameters at their best - fit values and calculate the likelihood of the model . by fixing the non - spectral parameters",
    ", we are only sampling a subset of possible spectra that might be degenerate with the best - fit power - law model , making this approach conservative .",
    "we determine the statistical significance of each model by obtaining the p - value calculated from the @xmath160 , eq . ( [ pval ] ) .",
    "we generate an ensemble of power spectra to @xmath112-order in the flow space and select only those lying within @xmath161 of the best - fit model .",
    "a sampling of power spectra meeting this criterion are shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the current cmb data provided by wmap3 @xcite only reliably constrains the form of the power spectrum on intermediate scales , @xmath162 , with much variation on larger spatial scales where cosmic - variance is the dominant source of error . by doing away with the spectral parameterization eq ( [ spec ] )",
    ", we also free ourselves from the constraints imposed on the tensor - to - scalar ratio by sdss data , the tightest bounds affecting models with a constant running of the spectral index .",
    "the flow method allows us to generate models with varied forms , including models with non - constant running .",
    "such models can support a relatively large value of @xmath151 by having a large running on these scales that turns off on the intermediate scales probed by sdss .",
    "for example , we find spectra with @xmath163 that yield equally good fits to the wmap+sdss data as the best - fit power - law , a value which is well outside the @xmath164 @xmath147-confidence limit for spectra with running . by considering more general power spectra ,",
    "one therefore opens up regions of parameter space excluded in simpler models .",
    "the inflation models responsible for generating the strongly running spectra in this study are characterized by an initially fast - rolling inflaton .",
    "observable scales exit the horizon before the field slows to the slow - roll attractor , yielding a large amplitude of gravitational waves and significant running .",
    "we are able to conclude that while slow - roll inflation models yield perhaps the simplest explanation for the origin of large scale structure , _ fast - rolling _ inflaton fields are equally suitable candidates from a strictly data - driven standpoint .",
    "another interesting approach is to expand the inflationary model space beyond the simplest class of canonical single field models .",
    "an example is the dbi inflation scenario @xcite analyzed using flow techniques by peiris _",
    "@xcite , who find that such models are strongly constrained by the existing data .    finally , we draw attention to the work of lesgourgues and valkenburg , ref . @xcite . in that analysis ,",
    "the authors consider an enlarged inflationary parameter space consisting of the coefficients of a taylor expanded inflaton potential .",
    "they perform a bayesian parameter estimation analysis and obtain confidence intervals on an ensemble of power spectra and their associated inflaton potentials .",
    "this choice of parameterization excludes models that deviate strongly from slow - roll , in particular , models of the type found in this analysis . aside from this difference",
    ", we find good agreement between our results , which are based on inferential statistics that are frequentist in nature , and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , derived using strictly bayesian methods .",
    "the bottom line is that current cmb data does not reliably constrain the form of the power spectrum , and this conclusion can be reached from either a bayesian or a frequentist approach .",
