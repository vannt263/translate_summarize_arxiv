    "morphology - dependent resonances ( mdrs ) , which is defined as the resonances found in cylindrical , spherical and ellipsoidal shaped optical cavities , are a much studied topic in the field of optics due to their practical importance in many applications @xcite as well as their heuristic value .",
    "more than a decade ago , johnson is the first to approach mdr in a spherical cavity @xcite as an analogy of quantum mechanical resonances , which is familiar in nuclear , atomic , and molecular scattering theory . by the same approach ,",
    "nckel have studied mdr analytically in a cylindrical cavity @xcite as an unperturbed system in order to analyze a slightly deformed one .",
    "recently , study of the mdr is resurfaced as a hot issue in connection with the application of deformed microcavity lasers because of its high potentiality of application for photonics and optoelectronics .",
    "_ have reported the existence of a different set of resonances , which can be classified as shape ( _ outer _ ) resonances ( _ ors _ ) with high leakage along with feshbach ( _ inner _ ) resonances ( _ irs _ ) in a two - dimensional dielectric circular microdisk for transverse magnetic ( tm ) and transverse electric ( te ) polarizations @xcite .",
    "the similar topic was treated in a numerical method for quantum billiard @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of these two classes of resonances to the so - called _ small opening limit _ where the refractive index @xmath1 of the disk goes to infinity have been explicitly studied @xcite and the applicability of effective potential analogy for the ors has been checked @xcite .",
    "one intriguing fact of the mdr dynamics from last two studies is that , for te polarization with magnetic field @xmath2 perpendicular to the cavity plane , both irs and ors are found in the same region of complex wavenumber plane where the regime of @xmath1 is practically relevant .    in two - dimensional chaotic quantum billiards , it is well known that the level dynamics resembles dynamics of one - dimensional particles with repulsive interaction as a system parameter varies @xcite .",
    "it is called avoided level crossing . similarly , avoided resonance crossing ( arc ) phenomenon in open hamiltonian systems",
    "is generally categorized into two classes @xcite . in the case of a strong interaction , shortly _ strong arc _ , the imaginary parts of complex - valued energies are crossing and the real parts are avoided .",
    "the identities of the two modes are exchanged via the arc and their wave patterns are strongly superposed during the arc . for a weak interaction , shortly _ weak arc _ , the real parts are crossing and the imaginary parts are avoided while their identities are retained .    in two - dimensional chaotic dielectric cavities , there have been undertaken many theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite researches related with the arc .",
    "due to the open property , the resonance dynamics in a dielectric cavity is much complicated and shows diverse aspects compared to that of the closed billiard .",
    "recently , it has been represented that , when a deformation parameter is varied in the rectangular or elliptic cavity , of which the corresponding billiard is integrable , arc can occur by the effect of openness @xcite .",
    "another recent report have claimed that , even on a slight deformation from the disk shape , a symmetry breaking of escaping rays occurs , which gives rise to dramatic changes in emission patterns depending on the characteristics of deformations @xcite , and emission directions and resonance patterns are deeply influenced by the refractive index of the cavity , i.e. , openness of the system , as well as the underlying classical manifold structures @xcite .",
    "these imply that analyzing the emission directions and mode patterns of slightly deformed cavities requires understanding of the mdr dynamics for openness .    in this paper",
    ", we uncover the mechanism behind the mdr dynamics in a circular disk for te polarization as the openness parameter @xmath3 is varied and observe the impacts of pure openness on the dynamics .",
    "the perfect rotational symmetry provides the analysis possible .",
    "the generic two - dimensional dielectric cavities have mainly two types of changeable system parameters , e.g. , degree of geometrical deformation and openness . in such cavities",
    ", irs can generally interact with each other .",
    "their resonance dynamics contains a complicated mixture of the aspect by deformation and the effect of openness . on the other hand",
    ", the circular disk does not have any deformation parameter and the only relevant parameter is the openness .",
    "moreover , its rotational symmetry makes that the angular component of the wavefunction is trivial . as a result",
    ", it renders the system effectively one - dimensional and then leads more clear and basic study for the pure openness without the aspect by deformation .    , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "[ fig : arcs_disk],width=321 ]    the helmholtz equation of dielectric cavities is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the wavefunction and the wavenumber , respectively .",
    "in the disk with the radius @xmath9 , the complex - valued wavenumbers @xmath10 for resonances are obtained from the boundary matching conditions for tm and te polarizations under the purely outgoing wave condition @xcite . in the opening regime",
    "@xmath11 , the irs , @xmath12 , are labelled by angular momentum quantum number @xmath13 and modal ordering number @xmath14 which corresponds to the number of radial intensity peaks inside the cavity .",
    "similarly , the ors can be also represented by @xmath15 , where @xmath14 is assigned in accordance with the increasing order of @xmath16 $ ] . for a given @xmath13 , the maximum numbers of ors in tm and te polarizations are @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] , respectively ( the notation @xmath19 $ ] is integer value ) .",
    "notice that , in te case , some ors have relatively low leakage and we have especially called them _ low - leaky outer resonances _ ( low - leaky ors ) @xcite .",
    "since there is only one low - leaky or having the largest @xmath16 $ ] among the ors for each @xmath20 , low - leaky ors can be denoted by @xmath21)$ ] .",

    "when the openness increases , @xmath5 interacts with @xmath28 via strong arc at @xmath29 .",

    "it has been known that two - dimensional optical dielectric cavities are typically non - integrable systems due to their open property and the openness breaks the integrability of the systems .",
    "consequently , the avoided crossings between the irs occur in the optical cavities , even if their corresponding billiards are integrable .",
    "it was explicitly shown in elliptic and rectangular cavity @xcite .",
    "but , unlike the cavities which correspond to integrable billiards such as rectangular and elliptic cavity , the avoided crossings between irs intriguingly do not occur in the case of circular disk cavity even though the system is open .",
    "this fact implicitly indicates that the irs remain with the properties of the normal modes in the corresponding billiard which is integrable in this case .",
    "before we discuss the numerical results , we will consider the analytical approach through a toy model .",
    "the arcs can be displayed with effective hamiltonian composed of a non - hermitian @xmath44 matrix and a coupling term as follows:@xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the complex energy @xmath48 of ir and or , respectively .",
    "the off - diagonal element in the coupling term , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , describes the coupling effect from or ( ir ) to ir ( or ) and it is assumed that the coupling effects are proportional to @xmath33 due to the fact that the coupling must becomes zero in the small opening limit .",
    "equation leads the eigenvalues @xmath51    to simply illustrate the arcs , we substitute @xmath46 and @xmath47 with the intuitive relations of the mdr dynamics .",
    "firstly , to obtain the basic mdr dynamics for te case except for the effects of mode interaction and brewster angle by openness , we borrow the dynamics for tm polarization , in which the interactions between the two types of resonances are infinitesimal in the experimentally feasible opening regime due to the absence of low - leaky ors . from this , @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] of an ir become almost linear to @xmath33 and to @xmath53 , respectively @xcite . here",

    "secondly , we consider that the destinations of @xmath55 of irs and @xmath10 of ors in the small opening limit for te case , correspond to the zeros of bessel function @xcite , @xmath56 , and the zeros of hankel function derivatives @xcite , @xmath57 , respectively .",
