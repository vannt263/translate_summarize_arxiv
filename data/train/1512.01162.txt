    "in recent years there is increasing interest in understanding the film morphologies of anisotropic , conjugated organic molecules at inorganic surfaces . a prime example",
    "are systems of optically active molecules at inorganic surfaces ; these so - called hybrid inorganic / organic systems ( hios ) represent a very promising material class in optoelectronics.@xcite typically , the corresponding organic molecules are strongly anisotropic in shape and are characterized by complex charge distributions , often dominated by a quadrupole moment .",
    "@xcite by manipulating the orientational structure of such organic layers it is possible to tune the efficiency of the charge carrier transport  @xcite and thus to optimize the efficiency of the hybrid system . somewhat earlier ,",
    "organic molecules at interfaces have attracted attention in the context of so - called langmuir monolayers , that is , two - dimensional ( 2d ) films of typically amphiphilic molecules constrained to a liquid - gas interface .",
    "@xcite again , the orientational and translational structure in such systems can be quite complex .    from the theoretical side , a full microscopic treatment of an organic molecular layer is still challenging , and this holds particularly for hios ( where the substrate is typically patterned ) . on the level of atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    ", one has to consider a large number of interactions such as atomic bonding , van der waals ( lennard - jones ) potentials , contributions due to bending or torsion of a molecule ( see e.g. ref .  ) , and electrostatic interactions .",
    "even then , it often turns out that atomistic md calculations do not correctly predict the arrangement of several particles , one main reason being the insufficient treatment of polarizability effects .",
    "@xcite an example that demonstrates this issue is the quadrupolar molecule benzene , where a representation via atomic point charges  @xcite or multipoles  @xcite fails to reproduce the corresponding dimer configuration .",
    "this suggests to employ quantum chemical approaches to evaluate the electronic structure of the entire system , instead .",
    "however , at the moment , this level of complexity is computationally far too demanding , especially at finite temperatures .    given these difficulties , the goal of the present paper is to understand _ generic _ aspects of the structural behavior of quadrupolar , anisotropic molecules at interfaces based on a _ coarse - grained _ model .",
    "specifically , we investigate a 2d many - particle system composed of ellipse - shaped particles with an embedded , axially symmetric quadrupole tensor ( higher - order multipoles are neglected ) .",
    "the quadrupole is oriented along one of the ellipsoidal axes as it is the case , e.g. , in benzene  @xcite or naphtalene , whose quadrupole tensor nearly has axial symmetry .",
    "@xcite we further assume that the center of the particles is confined to a 2d plane , and that the molecules are allowed to rotate only within this plane .",
    "interestingly , 2d quadrupolar systems are , so far , rather unexplored .",
    "this contrasts the situation in the 3d case , where a considerable amount of pioneering work involving quadrupolar particles at finite temperatures  @xcite and in the ground state @xcite is available . on the other hand",
    ", there are a number of simulation studies dealing with non - quadrupolar , shape - anisotropic particles in 2d , examples being hard ellipsoids ,  @xcite rectangles  @xcite or hard spherocylinders.@xcite in particular , the density - driven nematic - isotropic transition of hard ellipsoids was already investigated in ref .   and turned out being continuous or of first order depending on the aspect ratio .",
    "we also mention a density functional study  @xcite of 2d systems of anisotropic particles exhibiting isotropic phases and phases with simultaneous orientational and translational order .",
    "thus , the important open question to be explored in the present article concerns the interplay of shape anisotropy and quadrupolar intermolecular interactions .    to this end",
    "we employ two types of numerical calculations , that is , optimization techniques based on ideas of evolutionary algorithms ( ea ) and constant - pressure md simulations , revealing the system s behavior in the ground state and at finite temperatures . to facilitate the calculations ,",
    "the non - electrostatic part of the interaction between two molecules is modeled via a purely repulsive , relatively stiff ( but not infinitely hard ) pair potential that foots on the ellipse - like contact distance suggested by berne and pechukas .",
    "@xcite the analytical form of this pair potential resembles an anisotropic soft - sphere potential , but has a higher exponent.@xcite this potential turned out to be suitable for both type of numerical calculations .",
    "van der waals interactions between the molecules are entirely neglected .",
    "although this may seem somewhat unrealistic for real molecules , there are several advantages of the resulting ( repulsive ) potential : it reduces the number of parameters , it allows ( as we will demonstrate ) for a transferability between results at different system parameters , and it makes it possible to establish a connection of the present study to investigations of anisotropic colloidal particles in confined geometry.@xcite    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in our investigations we consider a two - dimensional system , embedded in the @xmath3-plane , where the anisotropic particles are only allowed to rotate around the @xmath4-axis .",
    "we use reduced units throughout , introducing parameters @xmath5 for the length scale , @xmath6 for the energy scale , and @xmath7 for the unit of mass .",
    "our particles are assumed to have an elliptic shape , characterized by the lengths of the two main axes , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; the indices refer to the orientation of the corresponding axes relative to the linear quadrupolar moment to be introduced below ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) . defining a dimensionless shape anisotropy parameter , @xmath10",
    ", we impose via @xmath11 that the surface area of our particles is independent of the actual value of @xmath10 . the isometric case of a disc",
    "is recovered for @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction between two - particles ( with indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) can be split into a short - ranged , anisotropic repulsion , @xmath15 , and a long - ranged potential , @xmath16 ; the latter one stems from the interaction of the linear quadrupoles that the particles carry .",
    "we define the distance @xmath17 between the centers of the particles and further @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the normalized orientation vectors of the respective linear quadrupolar moments . within our model",
    "the shape of the particle is the same for @xmath10 and @xmath21 , while the respective orientations of the embedded quadrupole moment are perpendicular for the cases @xmath10 and @xmath21 ( see bottom panels of figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "consequently , by choosing values of @xmath10 both smaller and larger than unity we are able to consider these two orientations of the quadrupolar moment within the same model .    with the above vectors at hand we introduce @xmath22    for the short - range contribution of the inter - particle interaction ( subscript `` sr '' ) we use an anisotropic , repulsive potential",

    "in contrast to dipoles , which tend to line up head - to - tail , isolated linear quadrupoles prefer the so - called t - configuration for @xmath10 close to unity ( see figure [ fig : t_configuration ] ) . a more detailed discussion of the impact of shape anisotropy on the two - particle arrangement with a minimal electrostatic energy is given in appendix  [ sec : two - particle arrangement with minimal electrostatic energy ] .    throughout",

    "this information helps us to classify archetypical particle arrangements ( each characterized by a particular spatial and orientational order ) , which , in turn , help us to understand the strategy of the particles of how to assemble in the energetically most favorable manner . for these investigations",
    "we employ an optimization tool based on evolutionary algorithms , detailed below .    in a _",
    "second _ step we take advantage of these ground state configurations and use them as starting configurations in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , performed at small , but _ finite _ temperatures .",

    "@xcite eas are heuristic approaches designed to search for global minima in high - dimensional search spaces and for problems that are characterized by rugged energy landscapes .    in an effort to be compatible with the requirements of an @xmath39-ensemble , we introduce in our approach a unit cell of variable area and shape which creates ( together with its periodic images ) a system of infinite extent . in the desired configuration ( the so - called ground state configuration ) particles",
    "are located and oriented in this cell in such a way as to minimize the internal energy of the system , which at vanishing temperature is equivalent to the enthalpy .",
    "we initialize the algorithm by creating a set of configurations where particles are located in the cell at random positions and have random orientations .",
    "these arrangements are graded by their respective fitness value , a quantity that provides evidence on how suitable this configuration is to solve the optimization problem .",
    "since we are interested in finding ground state structures , a high fitness value of a particular configuration corresponds to a low value of the enthalpy per particle .",
    "then we iteratively use existing particle arrangements to create new ones by applying one of the two following operations : crossover and mutation . in the former one we first select two configurations where the choice is biased by high fitness values of the two configurations .",
    "characteristic features of both particle arrangements ( such as lattice vectors , particle positions , and particle orientations ) are then combined to form a new configuration .",
    "the mutation operation , on the other hand , introduces random changes to a randomly chosen configuration , such as moving or rotating an arbitrarily chosen particle or changing the lattice vectors .",
    "typically 2000 iterations are required for a particular state point until convergence towards the global minimum has been achieved .",
    "our implementation of eas is memetic , i.e. , we combine global and local search techniques : each time a new configuration has been created with one of the two above mentioned ea operations , we apply the l - bfgs - b @xcite algorithm which guides us to the nearest local minimum .",

    "the shape of @xmath113 ( see figure [ fig : ea_2_1 ] ) indicates that the transition between hb@xmath146 and hb@xmath121 ( and also the subsequent transition to the pd - structure ) is of first order , i.e. , at some point the relative orientation of neighboring particles is discontinuous .    at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath132 and the order parameters do not necessarily behave in the same manner as the system changes from one structure to the other : some order parameters or @xmath132 may change abruptly , indicating a first order phase transition , while the other parameters change continuously . as an example we refer the reader to the transition hb@xmath121 @xmath147 pd for @xmath148 .",
    "another interesting feature emerges as we compare the curves of the order parameters shown in figure  [ fig : ea_2_1 ] obtained for the parameters @xmath149 , with the corresponding data calculated for the parameter sets @xmath150 and @xmath151 , shown in figures  [ fig : ea_02_01 ] and  [ fig : ea_20_10 ] , respectively .",
    "the corresponding curves reveal striking similarities , suggesting that appropriate scaling relations of the order parameters via the values of the quadrupole moment and the pressure hold for the respective ground states .",
    "in contrast ( and interestingly ) , the enthalpy curves obtained for the different sets of data differ rather substantially in magnitude .",
    "we will discuss a possible background scenario of these observations in more detail in appendix  [ sec : reduction of parameter space for hard particles ] .",
    "there we will show that indeed a scaling relation for the enthalpy of a systems of _ hard _ , quadrupolar particles can be derived ( see appendix  [ sec : reduction of parameter space for hard particles : ground state ] ) .",
    "however , it seems that the softness of our particles  remember that we consider in this contribution particles with a _ soft _ ( albeit rather steep ) core  leads to a breakdown of this scaling law .",
    "this feature is presumably due to the fact that a simultaneous scaling of the quadrupole moment and of the pressure also induces a change of the density .",
    "to take into account this effect properly , we suggest in appendix  [ sec : phenomenological enthalpy scaling for non - hard particles at ground state ] an empirical scaling law for the ground state enthalpy of a system of soft ellipsoidal particles and provide numerical evidence for its justification .              in the current subsection , we analyze the md results that we have obtained for all considered aspect ratios @xmath10 and a set of reduced temperatures @xmath90 .",

    "we start with a detailed investigation of the structure at @xmath130 , @xmath131 and different temperatures .",
    "the md simulations reveal that the structures predicted for vanishing temperature remain stable also at low temperature ( @xmath164 , see panels in the second column of figure [ fig : systems_quadrupolar_mdsnap ] ) . as @xmath90 increases monotonously , defects start to form ( see panels in the third column of figure [ fig : systems_quadrupolar_mdsnap ] ) : the most common of these is a slight wave - like modulation of previously straight lines . finally , once the temperature has been raised above a certain threshold value ( see panels in the fourth column of figure [ fig : systems_quadrupolar_mdsnap ] ) , the crystalline order is rapidly lost .",
    "the corresponding transition temperatures depend strongly on @xmath10 : configurations with @xmath165 ( t@xmath166-configuration ) and @xmath10 far from unity ( pd - configuration ) turn out to be the most stable ones : in this situation , particles can approach very closely and exert thus a strongly attractive quadrupole - quadrupole interaction ; these ordered structures break up only at temperatures as high as @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively .",

    "we observe a rapid decay of @xmath180 towards unity for large particle distances @xmath187 : the crystalline order has completely vanished , reflected by the missing peaks for larger @xmath187-values .",
    "since at low temperatures all particles are oriented in the same direction , @xmath181 is equivalent to @xmath180 ; however , as the temperature attains @xmath168 , we observe that for large @xmath187-values the orientational order is lost and thus @xmath181 vanishes already at @xmath188 .",

    "given the large amount of numerical calculations required to construct the melting line in figure  [ fig : meltingdiagramp1qsqrt2 ] , which was calculated for one particular set of parameters , @xmath192 , it would be obviously desirable and helpful to have a scaling relation at hand which allows to easily obtain ( or to extrapolate ) corresponding melting lines for other parameter sets . in appendix",

    "in summary , we have proposed a simple model that mimics the essential features of elongated , organic molecules without a net charge or dipole moment : it consists of soft ellipsoids with an embedded linear quadrupole moment .",
    "the preferred orthogonal arrangement of linear quadrupole moments in close proximity to each other represents an interesting contrast as compared to dipolar systems , where particles prefer parallel arrangements , thus often forming chains .",

    "<S> interestingly , we find , besides the intuitively expected t - like configurations , a variety of complex structures , characterized with up to three different particle orientations . in an effort to explore the impact of thermal fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> we perform constant - pressure molecular dynamics simulations within a range of rather low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that ground state structures formed by particles with a large aspect ratio are in particular suited to withstand fluctuations up to rather high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our comprehensive investigations allow for a deeper understanding of molecular or colloidal monolayer arrangements under the influence of a typical electrostatic interaction on a coarse - grained level .    </S>",
