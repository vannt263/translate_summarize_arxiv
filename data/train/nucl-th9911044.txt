    "for the last few decades , elastic scattering of deuterons by protons at the backward angle at intermediate energies has intensively been studied as an important source of information of nuclear interactions and reaction dynamics , by including non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in the consideration @xcite . since @xmath0he has the same spin as the proton s , the spin structure of the scattering amplitude of the d+@xmath0he ( d@xmath0he ) system is similar to that of the d+p ( dp ) one when @xmath0he is considered as a single body @xcite .",
    "then the backward elastic scattering of the deuteron by @xmath0he attracts our attention , for investigations of probable differences as well as similarities of the information when compared to the dp scattering .    in the dp backward scattering , the assumption of mechanism by neutron transfer from the deuteron to the proton ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) @xcite has been fundamentally successful in explaining energy dependence of observables . for example , the neutron - transfer mechanism produces the overall agreement to the experimental cross section @xmath1 of the scattering up to gev - energy region when the empirical momentum distribution of the deuteron is employed in the relativistic framework @xcite and the simple pwia calculation by the mechanism describes qualitative features of the measured tensor analyzing power @xmath2 and polarization transfer coefficient @xmath6(d@xmath7p ) at few hundreds mev @xcite .",
    "further , the measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the scattering have broad resonance - like structures around @xmath8 = 1 gev in the plot against the incident energy @xcite , which have been interpreted as the signal of excitations of the transferred neutron to @xmath9-states ( fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) @xcite .",
    "the pwia calculation by the transfer mechanism has reproduced the observed structure of @xmath2 when effects of other reaction channels like the @xmath9 excitation have been phenomenologically included @xcite . for the transfer mechanism ,",
    "the spin observables are described by the @xmath10 to @xmath11 ratio , where @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the deuteron @xmath12- and @xmath13- wave functions in the momentum space , and thus the information of the nuclear interaction obtained by the spin observables is generally of different nature from the one by the cross section @xcite .    in the case of the @xmath0he target ,",
    "the possible reaction mechanism of the backward scattering of the deuteron will be proton transfer from @xmath0he to the deuteron ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) as follows",
    ". the backward cross section of direct scattering , for example by potentials , is small compared to the forward one by several order of magnitude at intermediate energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section of the proton transfer reaction is large for the forward emission of @xmath0he , i.e. the backward for the deuteron , as in usual pick - up reactions .",
    "when the transfer mechanism is adopted , the analogy to the dp scattering suggests that the spin observables of the d@xmath0he scattering in the pwia are described by the @xmath10 to @xmath11 ratio , where @xmath11 and @xmath10 are now the wave functions of the p - d relative motion in @xmath0he .",
    "the wave functions , which are supplied by the faddeev calculation , have ambiguities due to the choice of interactions as the input @xcite .",
    "the information of the @xmath10 to @xmath11 ratio obtained from the spin observables will be useful in solving such ambiguities .",
    "further , the spin structure of the scattering amplitude for the d@xmath0he system is similar to that for the dp one even in the nucleon transfer mechanism because in both scattering the spin of the projectile is transformed in the same way , from one to one half , and similarly that of the target from one half to one .",
    "thus , the spin observables can be described in similar forms in these scattering and therefore some of their characteristics in the dp scattering will also be observed in the d@xmath0he one .",
    "these stimulate us to investigate the spin observables of the d@xmath0he scattering at the backward angle by theories as well as by experiments , which have not been attempted so far .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 will be investigated in detail because of its sensitivity to the wave functions .",
    "the theoretical prediction is performed up to gev - energy region similarly to the dp case although the present measurements are limited to a few hundreds mev . as the first step of investigations",
    ", we will try to clarify global features of @xmath2 in the scattering theoretically and to provide experimental evidence for the reaction mechanism .",
    "the interests of the investigation will be focused on ( i ) the validity of the assumption of the proton - transfer mechanism , ( ii ) effects due to the difference between the @xmath0he wave function and the deuteron one and ( iii ) the overview of effects of coupling to other reaction channels . in the following",
    ", experimental details are described in sec .",
    "ii , the pwia analyses are given in sec .",
    "iii , where in addition to the cross section and the analyzing power the polarization transfer coefficient and the spin correlation one are briefly discussed , and in sec .",
    "iv the effects of other reaction channels are investigated .",
    "section v is devoted to a summary , discussion and perspective .",
    "the d@xmath0he experiment was carried out at riken accelerator research facility for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "polarized deuteron beam was provided by the high - intensity polarized ion source @xcite .",
    "three polarization modes ( unpolarized and two tensor - polarized modes ) were cycled every 5 seconds .",
    "the beam polarization was measured with a polarimeter based on the @xmath14 elastic scattering after acceleration to 140 , 200 and 270 mev .",
    "it was monitored continuously during a run and obtained to be typically 6080% of the ideal value . at @xmath15200 and 270  mev ,",
    "detectors were placed at the angle where @xmath2 vanishes so that the polarimeter could work as a beam intensity monitor independent of beam polarization .",
    "a cryogenic @xmath0he gas target was bombarded by the polarized deuteron beams .",
    "the size of the target was 13  mm ( 20  mm ) wide , 15  mm ( 20  mm ) high and 20  mm ( 10  mm ) thick in the case of 270  mev ( 140 , 200  mev ) measurement .",
    "entrance and exit windows were 6  @xmath16 m thick havar foils .",
    "the gas pressure ( @xmath17  atm ) was measured with a baratron gauge .",
    "temperature of the target was monitored by using a diode thermo - sensor and found to be about 11  k throughout the experiment .",
    "the density of the @xmath18 gas was @xmath19  @xmath20 .",
    "scattered @xmath0he particles were momentum - analyzed in the magnetic spectrograph smart @xcite and detected by a multi - wire drift chamber and plastic scintillators placed at the focal plane .",
    "the total beam charge was measured with a faraday cup placed in the first dipole magnet and the beam intensity was monitored by the polarimeter described above .    in the off - line analysis ,",
    "data for @xmath21 were used . the background spectrum from the @xmath22 reactions on havar foils",
    "was subtracted to obtain the net yield for the d@xmath18 events .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio at the peak region was 420% depending on the beam energy .",
    "the tensor analyzing power @xmath2 was deduced from the ratios of yields for three polarization modes .",
    "the measured cross sections and analyzing powers with statistical errors are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the systematic errors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the former is mainly due to the uncertainties of both the beam intensity and the target thickness , whereas the latter is due to the uncertainty of the beam polarization .",
    "the theoretical analyses are performed first by the pwia .",
    "the approximation is rather crude but is still useful to obtain the qualitative feature of the reaction at the intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "analyses by extended formulas which include the effect of virtual excitations of other reaction channels will be presented in the next section .",
    "the @xmath0he wave function in the pd cluster configuration is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the proton - deuteron relative momentum in @xmath0he , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the wave functions of the proton and the deuteron , and @xmath29s are the z - components of their spins . in the pwia for the d@xmath0he scattering ,",
    "the proton transfer is induced by proton - deuteron interactions as the neutron transfer by neutron - proton interactions in the dp scattering @xcite .",
    "we denote the proton - deuteron scattering amplitude at the momentum @xmath30 by @xmath31 , neglecting the spin dependence similarly to the dp case . referring to the calculation of the dp scattering ,",
    "we get non - vanishing independent t matrix elements @xmath32 for the proton transfer in the d@xmath0he backward elastic scattering as @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath30 is related to the incident deuteron momentum @xmath36 as @xmath37 @xcite . the matrix elements ( [ eq2])-([eq4 ] )",
    "are equivalent to those in the dp backward scattering except for the factor @xmath38 , when @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath40 and @xmath31 by the n - p scattering amplitude . then the cross section @xmath1 and the tensor analyzing power @xmath2 are given as @xmath41 and @xmath42 here @xmath16 is the reduced mass of the d@xmath0he system .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq2])-([eq4 ] ) , one can also calculate other polarization observables , which are equivalent to those in the dp scattering .",
    "for example , the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath43(d@xmath7@xmath0he ) and the spin correlation coefficient @xmath5 are given as @xmath44 and @xmath45 the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath46 satisfy the equation of a circle as in dp scattering , @xmath47 at the low - energy limit where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "with the increase of the incident energy , the magnitude of @xmath51 is increased and the point defined by a set of @xmath46 and @xmath2 in the @xmath52 plane moves along the above circle clockwise for @xmath53 and counterclockwise for @xmath54 . as will be seen later , the former is the case of the dp scattering and the latter that of the d@xmath0he one .",

    "@xcite .    for the faddeev calculation of @xmath0he",
    ", we will specify the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force to the av14 potential @xcite and the three - nucleon ( 3n ) force to the 2@xmath55-exchange brazil model @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction is discarded and the @xmath0he nucleus is approximated by the triton .",
    "these potentials give the binding energy of the three - nucleon system as 8.34 ( 7.68 ) mev with ( without ) the 3n force @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the calculated @xmath11 and @xmath10 are shown as the functions of @xmath30 and are compared to those for the deuteron by the same nn force .",
    "the wave functions of @xmath0he have similar @xmath30-dependence to those of the deuteron in a global view but with the opposite sign of @xmath10 for most @xmath30 .",
    "due to the different sign of @xmath10 , the calculated @xmath51 of @xmath0he has the opposite sign to that of the deuteron except at large @xmath30 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "this characteristic of @xmath51 is consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that the asymptotic d - state to s - state ratio in @xmath0he has the opposite sign to that in the deuteron .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is infinite at the zero point of @xmath11 , @xmath56 , which is located at almost the same @xmath30 for @xmath0he and the deuteron , @xmath57 gev / c .",
    "the zero point of @xmath10 for @xmath0he , @xmath58 , is located at about @xmath59=0.79 gev / c ( 0.96 gev / c ) with ( without ) the 3n force .    the analysis of the measured cross section will not fully been performed because the cross section depends on the proton - deuteron scattering amplitude @xmath31 as is seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq51 ] ) , and reliable information of @xmath31 is not available at the present . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , however , a crude estimation which assumes the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath31 to be negligible for the relevant energies is presented .",

    "the characteristics of @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are reflected to @xmath2 of the scattering as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , where comparisons will be made in two ways ; one is the comparison of @xmath2 between the d@xmath0he scattering and the dp one and the other is that of @xmath2 between the calculated and the measured for the same scattering . due to the opposite sign of @xmath51 , in a small-@xmath30 region , the calculated @xmath2 for the d@xmath0he scattering has the opposite sign to that for the dp one . in the figure",
    ", the measured @xmath2 for the d@xmath0he scattering by the present experiment is shown together with that for the dp scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite and their signs are opposite to each other . since the dp and d@xmath0he scattering in the transfer model are essentially ( d , p ) stripping and ( d,@xmath0he ) pickup reactions , although the incident energies are higher than the conventional stripping and pickup reactions , the above feature is compared to that of measured @xmath2 for ( d , p ) and ( d , t ) reactions at low energies , where @xmath2 of the former reactions has the opposite sign to that of the latters in a wide angular range @xcite .",

    "the effect of the 3n force , which arises through high - momentum components of the @xmath0he wave function , is shown for the av14 potential .",
    "in large @xmath30 region , the contribution of the 3n force to @xmath2 becomes large and the second zero point of @xmath2 is shifted from @xmath30=0.96 gev / c to @xmath30=0.79 gev / c due to the 3n force .    in figs .",
