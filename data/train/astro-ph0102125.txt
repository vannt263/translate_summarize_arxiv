    "one of the most important legacies of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) will undoubtedly be its revolutionary increase in the number of cepheid - based distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "two major projects , the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale @xcite and the hst sn ia calibration project @xcite , as well as smaller collaborations have resulted in the discovery of over 700 cepheid variables and the determination of distances to 27 galaxies .",
    "this number will continue to grow as the community continues to take advantage of hst s unparalleled ability to deliver high - resolution images of the crowded spiral arms where cepheids are located .",
    "the next generation of instruments to be installed on board hst will increase its sensitivity and resolution and will extend these observations to larger distances .",
    "most hst cepheid observations have concentrated on obtaining data in the @xmath2 band ( typically in eight to thirteen non - aliasing epochs ) with some additional @xmath1-band data , usually four to eight epochs . although sparsely sampled , the @xmath1-band light curves are important for several reasons .",
    "first , they provide confirmation of the variables as cepheids , since the @xmath2 and @xmath1 light curves should track each other , with the latter displaying an amplitude of about half of that of the former .",
    "second , the @xmath3 colors should be consistent with those of cepheids in the instability strip .",
    "third , and most important , the @xmath1-band data provide the only means of correcting the observed distance modulus @xmath4 for extinction through the relation    -6pt @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the adopted ratio of total - to - selective extinction for the @xmath2-band @xcite and @xmath7 is the mean color excess of the cepheid sample (  5 contains a calculation of the value of @xmath8 ) .",
    "this approach makes the true distance modulus quite sensitive to both @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "a better procedure @xcite involves fitting a standard extinction curve through observed distance moduli at several wavelengths ( usually @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 ) and extrapolating the fit to @xmath11 .",
    "this approach is less susceptible to uncertainties in the individual observed distance moduli , and can also be used to test the assumed reddening law .    as the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale started its final cycle of observations , a subset of the team joined forces with colleagues outside the group to extend the work further into the infrared .",
    "our aim was to perform random - phase near - ir photometry of a sample of cepheids in fourteen galaxies and to combine the new and existing observed distance moduli .",
    "such a data set would allow us to improve the derivation of true distance moduli , check the assumptions behind equation ( 1 ) , and perhaps explore the effects of metallicity on the cepheid distance scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the observations and the data reduction pipeline ;  3 delineates the steps followed to obtain accurate and precise photometry in our fields ;  4 presents the cepheid sample , period - luminosity relations , and observed distance moduli ;  5 discusses our results .",
    "the hst near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) instrument @xcite , with its high spatial resolution and low thermal background , was uniquely suited to carry out the observations required by our program .",
    "nicmos contains three cameras ( named 1 , 2 and 3 ) which illuminate rockwell @xmath12 hgcdte arrays .",
    "the cameras have different pixel scales ( 0043 , 0076 and 02 , respectively ) , resulting in fields - of - view of 11 , 19  and 51 , respectively .",
    "since cepheids are scattered throughout the spiral arms of the target galaxies , we chose camera 2 ( hereafter nic2 ) as it provided the best trade - off between resolution and coverage .",
    "the fourteen galaxies selected for this study are listed in table 1 .",
    "the selection of specific fields within each galaxy was based on known positions and periods of cepheids , in order to maximize the number of variables and our coverage of the period - luminosity plane .",
    "we observed two fields in m101 , matching those observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these will be hereafter referred to as `` m101-inner '' and `` m101-outer . ''",
    "the observations followed the standard spiral - dith pattern , with two to four pointings depending on the field and filter used .",
    "exposure times for each pointing ranged from 16s for m31 to 640s for the most distant galaxies .",
    "some of the latter fields were imaged multiple times in order to increase measurement precision .",
    "once nicmos had been installed on board hst , several instrument characteristics were discovered .",
    "one is a variable additive bias ( called `` pedestal '' ) introduced during array reset , which has a different amplitude in each of the four quadrants that make up the array . because hgcdte arrays do not have overscan regions ,",
    "it is impossible to automatically remove this effect in the stsci pipeline .",
    "therefore , the bias offset is modulated by the flat field and appears as an inverse flat - field pattern in the final image .",
    "a second characteristic of the detectors is a noiseless signal gradient ( called `` shading '' ) , which is a temperature- and pixel- dependent bias that changes in the direction of pixel clocking during read - out .",
    "this presented a problem because the original implementation of the stsci processing pipeline did not use temperature - dependent darks .",
    "the combination of `` pedestal '' and `` shading , '' resulted in images with prominent spurious features .",
    "the level of photometric precision required by our program made it necessary to remove these instrumental effects .",
    "we did so by retrieving the raw frames from the stsci archive and reprocessing them as described below .",
    "our reprocessing of the data was performed using the nicmos pipeline present in iraf / stsdas with some modifications .",
    "first , temperature - dependent dark frames were generated and used when running the first part of the pipeline ( a program called calnica ) .",
    "this removed the `` shading '' effect .",
    "the `` pedestal '' effect was corrected using a program outside of the standard pipeline , courtesy of r. van der marel ( stsci ) .",
    "the program read in an image created by calnica , removed the flat - fielding imposed by it , and executed a loop to identify the pedestal .",
    "the pedestal is in fact measured by exploiting the property that a flat - fielded bias imparts fluctuations on the background of the final image .",
    "the fluctuations reach a minimum when the pedestal is removed completely .",
    "once a robust minimum was found in each of the quadrants , the best - fit pedestals were removed .",
    "lastly , the image was flat - fielded and written to disk",
    ".    having obtained images with proper zero , dark and flat - field corrections , the second part of the pipeline ( calnicb ) was run to combine the dithered pointings of each target field and produce a final mosaic .",
    "in addition , we used the dither package to produce higher - resolution mosaics of the m101 fields in the f160w band .",
    "this was possible thanks to the existence of four pointings per field in that galaxy .",
    "the mosaics were analyzed with the daophot  ii/ allstar software package @xcite .",
    "objects were detected with the find routine set to a threshold of @xmath13 above sky , and aperture photometry was carried out with the phot routine , using different apertures and sky annuli for each filter ( see below for details ) .",
    "point - spread functions were determined by the psf routine for each field using bright , isolated stars present in the frame .",
    "after an initial allstar run , the star - subtracted frame was put through the find algorithm once more to pick up any additional @xmath13 objects .",
    "object lists were merged and allstar was run one last time on the original image .",
    "psf magnitudes were brought onto a consistent aperture magnitude system using daogrow ( see @xcite for details ; only a short summary is presented here ) .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained for psf stars in each field ( @xmath14 in total ) using a monotonically increasing set of radii .",
    "daogrow then solved for a function representing the `` growth curve '' , i.e. , the change in aperture magnitude as a function of radius .",
    "the cumulative growth curves for the f110w , f160w and f205w bands are shown in figure 1 .",
    "other programs in the daophot suite used this information to transform psf magnitudes to aperture magnitudes for objects of interest in each frame .",
    "the nicmos primary standards are g191-b2b , a white dwarf , and p330-e , a solar analog .",
    "these two stars provide absolute calibration in the white dwarf and solar analog scales , respectively . since cepheids have colors similar to those of solar analog stars , we used p330-e for the determination of magnitude zeropoints .",
    "we used nicmos observations of g191-b2b , p330-e , and p117-d ( another solar analog standard ) for the determination of color terms .",
    "ground - based @xmath15 photometry for nicmos standards comes from @xcite .",
    "our definition of @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath17 zeropoints is based on different apertures and sky annuli for each band , to match the noticeable increase in fwhm as a function of wavelength .",
    "table 2 lists our choices of aperture radius and inner and outer sky annuli for each of the three bandpasses . in the case of the drizzled m101 f160w images , which have twice the spatial resolution ,",
    "all radii were increased by a factor of two in pixel units so they would subtend the same angular size .",
    "marcia rieke kindly provided us with synthetic ( tinytim ) stellar images as well as nicmos observations of p330-e , which we used to derive the magnitude zeropoints for our choices of aperture and sky annuli .",
    "first , we computed the ratio of tinytim counts to observed nicmos count rates for p330-e as a function of aperture radius .",
    "we found this ratio to be constant , at the 0.05% , 0.03% , and 1.77% levels for f110w , f160w and f205w , respectively , over a large range in radius ( 525 pixels ) .",
    "this confirmed that the tinytim image was a good representation of the actual system psf .",
    "we then re - scaled the tinytim image ( in arbitrary units ) to match the actual mean observed count rate of p330-e ; this produced a synthetic image of p330-e that could be used to perform aperture measurements on a `` perfect '' image free of defects , cosmic rays , or any other source of scatter found in real images .",
    "next , we ran daophot s phot routine on the synthetic p330-e images using the same aperture and sky annuli as for the cepheid photometry .",
    "daophot quoted measurement errors of 0.004 mag for these magnitudes .",
    "lastly , we combined the @xcite standard magnitudes and the daophot nicmos instrumental magnitudes for p330-e to arrive at our magnitude zeropoints , listed in table 2 .      since the nicmos filters are not exact matches to the standard filters , color term corrections had to be determined .",
    "synthetic spectra of the nicmos standards were created based on kurucz latest solar - abundance models .",
    "these model spectra were convolved with two sets of transmission curves : one contained the nicmos filter responses plus the quantum efficiency of camera 2 , while the other was based on standard filter responses plus an atmospheric transmission curve .",
    "this allowed us to predict f110w , f160w , f205w , @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath17 magnitudes for the nicmos standards .",
    "we then compared our results with published values @xcite and found negligible offsets of @xmath18  mag for @xmath16 and @xmath0 and a small offset of @xmath19  mag for @xmath17 .",
    "we used the same model atmospheres and transmission curves described above to generate synthetic spectra for a variety of spectral types ( f , g and k ) and luminosity classes ( i and v ) .",
    "we compared the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 as well as the values of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "we found    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath24 are the mean instrumental colors of the star to be corrected .",
    "these formulae are suitable for correcting our data since our f110w , f160w and f205w observations were taken within minutes of each other .",
    "the mean values of the corrections were @xmath27  mag for @xmath28 , @xmath29  mag for @xmath30 and @xmath31  mag for @xmath23 .",
    "note that an exact correction for @xmath30 was only applied to the stars in the 1613 , m31 , m101-inner and m101-outer fields .",
    "the other fields were observed only in f160w and therefore only an average h - band correction of @xmath32  mag could be applied , based on a mean cepheid @xmath26 color of @xmath33  mag .",
    "the dense nature of most of our fields makes it difficult to obtain accurate values of the local sky around each object and to perform unbiased magnitude measurements .",
    "this effect is commonly referred to as `` crowding '' . in order to characterize its impact on our measurements",
    ", we injected artificial stars into each field and compared their input magnitudes with the recovered values .",
    "we used the point - spread functions derived for each field to generate the artificial stars , which were placed randomly across each field .",
    "the objects spanned a magnitude range including that encompassed by the variables . in the case of the m101 fields",
    ", we injected artificial stars into the original - resolution mosaics as well as the higher - resolution ones created by drizzling .",
    "we re - ran our photometry programs on the new images and searched the new star lists to locate the artificial stars .",
    "the results of the tests are summarized in table 3 and displayed in figures 2a - b .",
    "figure 2a contains plots of the difference between input and recovered magnitudes as a function of magnitude for each field .",
    "figure 2b shows the strong correlation that exists between the crowding bias and the stellar density of each field .",
    "the effect ranges from 0.01  mag for the least crowded fields to 0.09  mag for the denser ones .",
    "all magnitudes were corrected for this effect .",
    "in addition to these `` crowding '' tests , we also undertook simulations to estimate the contamination of cepheid magnitudes by unresolved nearby stars .",
    "these `` blending '' tests are presented in  5 .",
    "we performed several internal and external photometry checks to ensure the accuracy and precision of our magnitudes .",
    "we tested our aperture correction technique by comparing our corrected magnitudes against `` standard '' aperture magnitudes for stars in the ic 1613 fields .",
    "we found no significant difference ( @xmath34  mag ) between the two sets .",
    "we also tested the repeatability of our psf photometry by comparing magnitudes of objects that appeared twice in our data set , due to some overlap between different fields in m81 and m101 .",
    "we found that the magnitude differences were consistent with the reported uncertainties .",
    "we also performed an external photometry check by comparing hst and ground - based photometry of bright , isolated stars in our 1613 fields .",
    "the ground - based photometry was obtained at the las campanas 2.5-m du pont telescope using its infrared camera @xcite over fourteen nights between november 1993 and november 1996 .",
    "photometry was conducted using daophot  ii / allstar and daogrow ( as described in  3.1 ) on 19 stars common to our ground - based and hst images .",
    "table 4 lists their magnitudes and figure 3 shows a comparison of the two systems ; the mean offset is @xmath35  mag , in the sense that the hst magnitudes are marginally brighter . unfortunately , there was no published @xmath16- or @xmath17-band photometry available for stars in any of our fields , so we were unable to check our transformation of nicmos f110w and f205w magnitudes .",
    "as described in  2.1 , we targeted specific fields within each galaxy in order to maximize the number of variables and our coverage of the period - luminosity plane .",
    "we selected the variables in each galaxy based on published catalogs , applying the following selection criteria : i ) existence of both @xmath2 and @xmath1 photometry ; ii ) range in color of @xmath36 ; iii ) periods between 10 days and the width of the observing window ( applicable to cepheids discovered with hst ) .",
    "our fields contained 93 variables that met these criteria .",
    "cepheids in m31 and ic1613 were identified by visual inspection , using finding charts created from ground - based images .",
    "these fields are sparse enough that identifications did not present a problem , and twelve variables were located . in the case of the other galaxies ,",
    "identifications followed a more rigorous process .",
    "first , the fits header coordinates for the center of the mosaic were used to obtain a rough alignment and rotation relative to an optical image ( from wfpc2 in most cases ) .",
    "next , bright stars present in both the optical and the near - ir images were identified and used as input to the iraf task geomap to determine the geometric transformations between the images .",
    "lastly , the task geoxytran was used to predict the coordinates of 81 variables .",
    "the daophot star lists generated in  3.1 were used to locate the object nearest to the predicted position of the variables . in general , counterparts were found within one pixel of their predicted location .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of differences between the predicted and actual positions .",
    "based on this figure , we decided to reject any candidate located more than 1.5 pixels ( 011 ) away from its predicted position .",
    "this process resulted in the rejection of 11 possible counterparts .    in order to further discriminate between real counterparts and field contaminants , we plotted @xmath37 vs. @xmath38 colors for all remaining candidates ( figure 5a ) .",
    "the cepheids follow a vector that is a combination of two closely degenerate quantities : the reddening trajectory and the color - color relation for these bands .",
    "several objects deviate significantly from the rest of the sample ; we suspect these are variables which are blended with unresolved red or blue companions .",
    "we performed a least - squares fit to the sample , using a fixed slope of @xmath39 ( the average of the reddening and color - color slopes ) .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "5a as a solid line , while the dashed lines correspond to twice the _ r.m.s .",
    "_ deviation , or 0.46  mag .",
    "we rejected twelve possible counterparts that fell outside of the dashed boundaries .",
    "figure 5b shows a histogram of the deviations from the best - fit line .",
    "the asymmetric distribution of the outliers is to be expected , since we are more likely to detect a cepheid that is blended with a red ( i.e. , ir - bright ) field star than with a blue ( i.e. , ir - faint ) one .",
    "note that this color - color rejection process is insensitive to blends of cepheids with stars of similar colors , a point to which we will return later .    in conclusion ,",
    "our final sample consists of 70 variables ( 93 original candidates  11 astrometric rejections ",
    "12 color - color rejections ) . finding charts for fields containing at least one variable are shown in figures 6a - f , while figures 7a - b contain close - up views of each object .",
    "table 5 presents periods and magnitudes for the final cepheid sample .",
    "we include in this table the previously - published optical magnitudes of the variables .",
    "there are minor variations in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 zeropoints used in the different sources of optical photometry , reflecting the evolution in our knowledge of the hst calibration from 1994 to the present ( see @xcite for details ) . for our target galaxies , the mean difference between the various calibrations used in the published papers and the current calibration @xcite amounts to @xmath40  mag in v , @xmath41  mag in i and @xmath42  mag in @xmath38 .",
    "the method used to derive observed distance moduli is the same as that used by the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "it is based on the period - luminosity relations of individually de - reddened lmc cepheids from @xcite ( @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) and @xcite ( @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath17 ) , scaled to an assumed true distance modulus of @xmath43 = 18.50@xmath440.10  mag ( total uncertainty ) .",
    "the relations are :    -6pt @xmath45 -4.22(\\pm0.02 ) , \\\\",

    ".    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fitting the data from each field and filter , we fix the slope to the one given in the corresponding equation and obtain a magnitude shift by minimizing the unweighted _ rms _ dispersion .",
    "the resulting magnitude shifts are converted to observed distance moduli by subtracting the relevant magnitude zeropoint .",
    "period - luminosity relations were constructed for each field and filter using the data listed in table 5 and fitted using equations 5 - 9 .",
    "figures 8a - f show our near - ir p - l relations , while figures 9a - e present the optical ones . in each panel ,",
    "the solid line represents the results of the fitting process described in  4.2 while the dashed lines indicate the _ rms _ uncertainty of the fit .",
    "fit results are displayed in each panel and listed in tables 6 and 7 .",
    "we also tabulate in table 6 published distance moduli for these galaxies ( mostly from table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , determined from substantially larger samples of variables and using the @xcite zeropoints .",
    "the optical distance moduli determined from our smaller samples should _ not _ take precedence over the above values .",
    "the optimum combination of the optical and infrared results will appear in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the motivations of this project was to further study the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation .",
    "our data can contribute to these studies on two ways : first , a global test of the metallicity dependence can be performed by analyzing the apparent distance moduli of all galaxies ; second , a differential test of the effect can be performed by analyzing the distance moduli to two regions of the same galaxy , provided they differ significantly in abundance .",
    "the first approach was undertaken by @xcite , while the second one was followed by @xcite in m31 and by @xcite in m101 .",
    "the differential test is a challenging one , because the inner field of m101 deviates substantially from other key project fields in terms of surface brightness and stellar density .",
    "our near - infrared distance moduli to the inner and outer fields in m101 exhibit large differences : @xmath46  mag and @xmath47  mag .",
    "if taken at face value , they imply a very large metallicity dependence , of the order of 0.6  mag / dex .",
    "however , other observational effects could be contributing to the observed differences in distance moduli .",
    "one of them is `` blending '' , or the contamination of cepheid fluxes by nearby stars , not physically associated with the variables , that fall within the nicmos seeing disk and can not be resolved .",
    "this effect has been the subject of a recent investigation in the optical by @xcite .    one way to characterize the effect of blending on our distance determination to m101-inner",
    "is to move nearby , well - resolved fields to the distance of m101 , re - observe cepheids in these fields , and compare the resulting magnitudes with the ones obtained from the original images .",
    "our program contains observations of two suitable galaxies : m31 and m81 .",
    "the fields observed in these galaxies show similar stellar densities and mean nearest - neighbor distances between cepheids when compared to our m101-inner fields .",
    "we used our two m81 fields as well as fourteen of our m31 fields , which were located in fields i and iii of @xcite .",
    "we started by collecting the positions and magnitudes reported by allstar for all objects in our input fields .",
    "the separation between stars were reduced by the ratio of distances between the input galaxies and the m101-outer field ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the input magnitudes were corrected for the exposure time of the original frames and distance to the input galaxies , and then modified to reflect the distance of m101 and the exposure time of the m101 frames .",
    "the stars were added to blank frames using the addstar routine found in daophot , which takes into account the properties of the detector and the psf , as well as photon statistics .",
    "the artificial fields are shown in figure 10 and compare favorably with the actual m101-inner images shown in figures 6a - f .",
    "once the artificial fields had been generated , they were photometered in exactly the same way as our real data . to identify the variables in our artificial frames , we used the input positions as the equivalent of the astrometric information available for the real data , and searched for the objects nearest to those positions , subject to the same 1.5-pixel rejection criterion from  4.1 .",
    "all cepheids that were recovered were located at distances smaller than the rejection limit .",
    "figure 11 shows the p - l relations obtained from the simulation , compared with the original input data .",
    "seven long period cepheids ( @xmath50  d ) exhibit changes in magnitude of order 0.1 - 0.2  mag , most of them being in the expected direction ( i.e. , towards brighter magnitudes ) . in the case of the eight cepheids with short periods",
    "( @xmath51  d ) , one was not recovered , four exhibited large variations ( which would have resulted in their rejection based on color - color criteria ) , and three had very modest changes in magnitude .",
    "the resulting distance moduli are smaller than the input ones by 0 - 0.2 mag , depending on the period cutoff applied to these small samples .",
    "the _ rms _ scatter of the relations do not increase significantly , once the short - period outliers are removed from the fits .",
    "we therefore conclude that a substantial fraction of the difference in distance moduli between m101-inner and m101-outer could be due to blending .",
    "this prevents us from performing a differential determination of the metallicity effect ; however , a global test can still be performed using the other galaxies we have observed .",
    "another goal of this project is to test whether the mean @xmath38 color excess , @xmath7 , is an appropriate indicator of total extinction and whether it can be used to obtain true distance moduli .",
    "one could claim that the range in wavelength between these two bands is too small to allow a good extrapolation to @xmath52 .",
    "there is also no guarantee that a `` standard '' value of @xmath8 is applicable to other galaxies . if @xmath7 is indeed a good indicator of reddening , and if a standard reddening law @xcite applies to other galaxies , then one would expect @xmath7 and @xmath53 to be strongly correlated and to follow the slope predicted by the standard reddening law .",
    "the mean @xmath38 and @xmath37 color excesses of a cepheid sample are related by    @xmath54    furthermore , the value of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 denotes the bandpass of interest ) can be calculated using the following relation :    @xmath57    where the ratio @xmath58 is defined in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite as    @xmath59    in turn , @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be calculated using equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ; @xmath62 is the inverse of the central wavelength of the band of choice .",
    "the value of @xmath63 suitable for cepheids and stars of similar colors is 3.3 .",
    "lastly , figure 3 of @xcite can be used to estimate the size of the uncertainty in @xmath58 .    in our case , we want to calculate the values of @xmath8 and @xmath64 .",
    "the cousins @xmath1 filter has @xmath65 , so @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath0 filter has @xmath70 , so @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the predicted ratio of @xmath53 to @xmath7 is    @xmath75      mean @xmath38 and @xmath37 color excesses were calculated following the methodology of the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale @xcite .",

    "the total scatter about the average value of the color excess in each field was used to determine the quoted uncertainty on the mean .",
    "the values of @xmath7 for 4182 , m101 ( inner & outer ) , 925 , 1365 , 2090 , 3621 , 4496a and 4536 were corrected by + 0.02  mag to bring them into the @xcite photometric system ( the other galaxies have ground - based or wf / pc v and i values and need not be corrected ) .",
    "the mean values of @xmath7 and @xmath53 are listed in table 8 and plotted in figure 12 .",
    "a least - squares fit to the data yields    -6pt @xmath77    the agreement between the predicted and observed ratio of @xmath53 to @xmath7 , and the fact that the fit to the data goes through @xmath78 within the errors , supports the assumption of a standard reddening law in the fields we have studied .",
    "one data point , corresponding to 3198 and plotted with an open circle , was excluded from the fit because it lies @xmath79 away from the relation defined by all other points .",
    "this field contains only three cepheids , two of which barely passed the color - color rejection test and are probably contaminated by red companions , therefore yielding an abnormally high value of @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cepheids present in the m101-inner field exhibit the same correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath53 as the other fields .",
    "this could imply that , on average , the contamination due to `` blending '' in that field has not introduced a significant change in the color of the cepheids .",
    "@xcite have found a similar effect among cepheids in the inner regions of m33 .",
    "we have obtained near - infrared photometry for a sample of 70 extragalactic cepheid variables located in thirteen galaxies ranging in distance from the local group to the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "we have combined our magnitudes with existing optical data to derive self - consistent period - luminosity relations .",
    "cepheids in the inner field of m101 appear to be severely contaminated by unresolved blends with nearby stars , thereby affecting our ability to perform a differential test of the dependence on metallicity of the cepheid period - luminosity relation .",
    "an analysis of mean color excesses of our sample supports the assumption of a standard reddening law by the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale in their derivation of true distance moduli .",
    "we would like to thank eddie bergeron of stsci for kindly providing us with temperature - dependent dark frames .",

    "<S> we present the results of near - infrared observations of extragalactic cepheids made with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer on board the _ hubble space telescope_. the variables are located in the galaxies 1613 , 4182 , m31 , m81 , m101 , 925 , 1365 , 2090 , 3198 , 3621 , 4496a and 4536 . all fields were observed in the f160w bandpass ; additional images were obtained in the f110w and f205w filters . </S>",
    "<S> photometry was performed using the daophot  ii / allstar package .    </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent distance moduli and color excesses were obtained by fitting period - luminosity relations in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the assumption of a standard reddening law adopted by the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale . </S>",
    "<S> a companion paper will determine true distance moduli and explore the effects of metallicity on the cepheid distance scale . </S>"
