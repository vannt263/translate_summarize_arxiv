    "systems with orbital degeneracy usually exhibit quite diverse properties , often much different from those of purely spin systems .",
    "@xcite in particular , the coupling between orbital and spin degrees of freedom , besides being of practical importance for many specific materials , leads to several interesting theoretical models , such as spin  orbital model ( often called the kugel  khomskii model )  @xcite , the popular nowadays compass model  @xcite , a particular version of which is the renowned kitaev model .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the specific features of one or another system with spin and orbital degeneracy strongly depend on the local geometry .",
    "the most typical cases , widely discussed in the literature , are those with mo@xmath0 octahedra ( m is a transition metal ion ) sharing common oxygen ( or common corner ) , typical e.g. of perovskites like lamno@xmath5 or layered systems such as la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 , and the situation with two common oxygens for neighboring octahedra ( octahedra with common edge ) , met in many layered systems with triangular lattices such as nacoo@xmath6 and linio@xmath6 .",
    "the features of spin ",
    "orbital systems in both these cases were studied in detail , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "however , there exists yet the third typical geometry , which is also very often met in many real materials  the case of octahedra with common face ( three common oxygens ) .",
    "strangely enough , this case has not been actually considered in the literature . to fill this gap and to develop a theoretical description of spin",
    " orbital ( kugel  khomskii ) model for this  third case \" is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "interestingly enough , after fulfilling this program , we have found out that the resulting model has a very symmetric form  more symmetric that for the cases of common corner or common edge .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian in the main approximation turned out to have a very high symmetry : su(4 ) .",
    "actually , su(4 ) model appeared already in the very first treatment of these models  @xcite for the  artificial \" illustrative case , in which for doubly - degenerate orbitals only the diagonal inter - site hopping exists , that is , @xmath8 where 1 and 2 are the indices denoting two degenerate orbitals .",
    "the resulting exchange hamiltonian , derived from the degenerate hubbard model in the strong coupling limit @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the on - site coulomb repulsion ) , written in terms of spin @xmath11=1/2 and pseudospin @xmath12 operators describing doubly - degenerate orbitals , has a very symmetric form @xmath13 this hamiltonian not only has su(2)@xmath14su(2 ) symmetry ( it contains scalar products of @xmath15 and @xmath16 vector operators ) , but it shows even much higher su(4 ) symmetry ( interchange of 4 possible states : 1@xmath17 , 1@xmath18 , 2@xmath17 , 2@xmath18 ) .    the su(4 )",
    "spin  orbital model was extensively discussed in the literature with the main emphasis on novel quantum states ( exact solution of the 1d model  @xcite ; the presence of three goldstone modes  @xcite ; the gap formation  @xcite ; spin - orbital singlets on plaquettes in square lattice  @xcite and in two - leg ladders  @xcite ; spontaneous symmetry breaking with the formation of dimer columns  @xcite ; real spin - orbital liquid on honeycomb lattice  @xcite ) .",
    "there were also some attempts to apply this model to real materials .",
    "@xcite recently the su(4 ) model ( or more general su(n ) model with n  colors \" ) has been applied also to cold atoms on a lattice .",
    "@xcite however , especially as to real transition metal compounds , these applications were still rather questionable .",
    "@xcite in the present paper , we demonstrate that there exists situation in transition metal solids , in which the su(4 ) physics might be close to reality  this is the case of spin  orbital systems with face - sharing mo@xmath0 octahedra .",
    "if we include the terms in the effective exchange hamiltonian , which break this su(4 ) symmetry , see appendix c , such terms are usually much weaker than the dominant su(4 ) exchange , so that in any case the su(4 ) physics would dominate the properties of a system in a broad temperature interval @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scale of su(4 ) terms in the exchange , and @xmath21 - that of symmetry - breaking terms ( typically in systems with 3@xmath22 elements @xmath23 ) .",
    "even at @xmath24 strong quantum fluctuations in su(4 ) model , especially in one - dimensional systems , may overcome the effect of symmetry - breaking terms .",
    "as far as the actual materials are concerned , in most typical and best studied geometries , such as in systems like perovskites , with corner - sharing mo@xmath0 octahedra and with @xmath25 m  o  m bonds ( m is the transition metal ) , the problem is that conditions   required for su(4 ) model   are not fulfilled . in effect , whereas the spin part of the spin ",
    "orbital exchange is of the heisenberg @xmath26 type [ su(2 ) ] , the orbital part of the exchange turns out to be very anisotropic , containing terms of the type @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and also some linear terms , but not , for example @xmath30 .",
    "( the latter terms can appear for complex combinations of the basis orbitals , which usually do not lead to static lattice distortions but may be sometime important giving rise to quite exotic types of the ground state .",
    "@xcite ) also for another well - studied case , that with edge - sharing octahedra and with 90@xmath31 m  o  m bonds , the situation is more complicated : sometimes the orbital part of the exchange is anisotropic , and in some cases the leading term in the exchange , @xmath32 , drops out at all and the remaining exchange depends on the hund s rule exchange ( not included above ) .",
    "@xcite    the third , much less studied situation , that with the face - sharing mo@xmath0 octahedra ( see fig .",
    "[ face_sharing ] ) is considered below . in situation with face - sharing octahedra",
    ", one naturally obtains for the doubly - degenerate case ( @xmath1 orbitals , or @xmath4 orbitals obtained from triply - degenerate @xmath2 orbitals due to trigonal crystal field , typical for this geometry ) that the resulting spin ",
    "orbital ( kugel  khomskii ) model is of the type of eq .  , i.e. it is the su(4)-symmetric model",
    "thus , the systems with this geometry , which are in fact quite abundant among transition metal compounds , represent an actual realization of the high - symmetry su(4 ) model , and can provide a natural testing ground for it .",
    "the experimental study of the systems with face - sharing arrays may thus allow for verification of the predictions of this model , such as the strong spin ",
    "orbital entanglement , and the presence of three goldstone modes .    experimentally , there are many transition metal compounds with the face - sharing geometry .",
    "such materials include for example hexagonal crystals like bacoo@xmath5  @xcite , bavs@xmath5  @xcite or cscucl@xmath5  @xcite , containing infinite columns of face - sharing ml@xmath0 octahedra ( l stands here for ligands o , cl , s , ... ) , as shown in fig .  [ face_sharing ] .",
    "many other similar systems have finite face - sharing blocks , e.g. bairo@xmath5 ,  @xcite baruo@xmath5  @xcite , or ba@xmath7ru@xmath5o@xmath33",

    "ii , we formulate a minimal model for the face - sharing geometry , which is in fact the hubbard model taking into account the orbital degrees of freedom . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we consider the chains of face - sharing octahedra with @xmath36 and @xmath2 , respectively , and demonstrate that in both cases we arrive at a highly symmetrical spin ",
    "orbital model .",
    "the obtained results are discussed in section v. more technical issues are discussed in appendices . in appendix",
    "a , we show that trigonal distortions characteristic of the face - sharing geometry do not affect the symmetric form of the effective spin  orbital hamiltonian . in appendix b",
    ", we derive the explicit form of the electron hopping integrals via ligands as function of an angle characterizing the trigonal distortion of octahedra . in appendix c",
    ", we present the general form of the exchange hamiltonian including the terms with the hund s rule coupling , going beyond the symmetric su(4 ) form .",
    "let us suppose that we have a linear chain of 3@xmath22 magnetic ions .",
    "each of them is located at the center of an octahedron of anions with face - sharing geometry .",
    "in contrast to the case of corner - sharing octahedra , where the @xmath37 direction is usually chosen along the fourfold symmetry axis connecting the transition metal ion with one of the apexes of the ligand octahedron ( tetragonal coordinate system ) , here it is convenient to choose trigonal system with the @xmath37 axis along the chain and the @xmath38 and @xmath39 axes in the plane perpendicular to the chain ( see fig .  [ figstruct]a ) . in such geometry , two nearest - neighbor ions , m1 and m2 , are non - equivalent : a pair ligand triangles surrounding one metal ion can be considered as rotated by 180@xmath31 with respect to that surrounding another ion .    ; the value @xmath40 corresponds to undistorted octahedron .",
    "magnetic atoms form a quasi - one - dimensional chain directed along the @xmath37 axis .",
    "( b ) crystal field splitting of @xmath22 orbitals of the magnetic atom .",
    "the splitting of @xmath2 levels ( @xmath41 ) is due to both the trigonal distortions of oxygen octahedra and contribution from neighboring m atoms to the crystal field .",
    "the sign of @xmath41 can be different depending on the type of distortions . ]    to formulate a minimal model for the chain , we start from the well - known hamiltonian in the second quantization that corresponds to a general problem of interacting electrons @xmath42 here , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote lattice sites , where the magnetic ion is located , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 run over the active orbitals on each site , @xmath49 , @xmath50 denote spin up or spin down and @xmath51 , ( @xmath52 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for an electron at site @xmath43 with the quantum numbers @xmath45 and @xmath49 . the first term describes the kinetic energy and the second one corresponds to the on - site coulomb repulsion , where @xmath53 here , @xmath54 are one - particle wave functions and @xmath55 describes the interparticle interactions .",
    "the crystal field felt by the magnetic ions has an important component of cubic @xmath56 symmetry due to octahedra of anions .",
    "it splits the one - electron @xmath22 levels into a triply degenerate level ( @xmath2 ) and a doubly degenerate level ( @xmath36 ) . in the case of the face - sharing octahedra ,",
    "actual symmetry is usually lower than @xmath56 due to , e.g. , axial order of the metal ions , which in such a geometry often form chains , dimers , trimers , etc .",
    "this type of low - dimensional packing in its turn results in drastic distortions of the ligand octahedra by itself so that octahedra appear to be trigonally distorted ( elongation or compression along the vertical @xmath37 direction in fig .",
    "[ figstruct]a ) .",
    "such local distortions of @xmath57 symmetry lead to splitting of @xmath2 orbitals into an @xmath3 singlet and @xmath4 doublet ; the original @xmath36 ( @xmath1 ) doublet by that remains unsplit ( see below fig .  [ figstruct]b ) .",
    "the model treatment will be performed separately for two situations , when @xmath36 and @xmath2 orbitals are active , taking into account trigonal distortions .",
    "we first consider the case of one hole ( electron ) at the degenerate @xmath36 level , which corresponds e.g. to the orbital filling of cu@xmath58 ions in cscucl@xmath5 .",
    "it has been established ( see , e.g. ref .  ) that both the trigonal field and the spin - orbit coupling do not split the @xmath36 levels .    in the case of ideal mo@xmath0 octahedra",
    ", one may use the trigonal coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath36 doublet for two neighboring magnetic ions along the chain can be written as  @xcite @xmath59 for an ion m1 , and @xmath60 for the nearest - neighbor ion m2 ( the corresponding structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figstruct]a ) .",
    "we start from the two - band 1d hubbard hamiltonian of the form of eq .  , where orbital indices @xmath45 take the values @xmath61 , @xmath62 for the m1 sites ( sites with e.g. odd @xmath43 ) or @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the m2 sites ( sites with even @xmath43 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves by the consideration of the nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes along the chain , @xmath65 .",
    "these hopping amplitudes have two contributions , which , for this particular geometry , could be of the same order of magnitude ; direct hopping between two magnetic ions along the chain , @xmath66 , and the indirect hopping via neighboring anions , @xmath67 .",
    "we consider both these situations separately .",
    "we begin by calculating the direct hopping terms .",
    "we choose the @xmath37 direction ( trigonal axis ) parallel to the chain .",
    "in this situation , the only monzero @xmath22@xmath22 slater  koster parameters  @xcite are @xmath68 therefore , we have for the direct case @xmath69 and @xmath70    the calculation of effective hoppings via ligands @xmath67 is more complicated . the direct derivation is performed in appendix b. here , we only show that @xmath71 using simple considerations .",
    "assume that we know hopping integrals along a superexchange path between two neighboring cations involving an anion ( a1 ) located at one of the apexes of the octahedron .",
    "in general , we have three nonzero hopping integrals @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 between m1 and m2 ions .",
    "then , the hopping integrals for other two superexchange paths ( via a2 and a3 ) could be found by rotating the @xmath75 plane by @xmath76 about the trigonal axis . denoting by primes the axis in the coordinate system rotated by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79",
    ", we can write taking into account that @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 . therefore @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 in terms of those via a1 according to @xmath86 . using eq .  , we obtain @xmath87 the hopping integrals via a3 are found by substituting @xmath77 for @xmath88 : @xmath89 the total hopping integrals are @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) . performing the summation over all three paths , we obtain @xmath92 the value of @xmath93 as a function of the @xmath94@xmath22 slater  koster parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and the @xmath94@xmath22 charge transfer energy @xmath97 is calculated in appendix b. here , we see that the situation is again similar to the direct exchange , for which we have equal hopping integrals between the same orbitals , and hopping between different orbitals is absent .",
    "this is a rather general result based only on the existence of the threefold trigonal axis and it does not depend on the specific features of the superexchange paths .",
    "therefore , the results , , show that the parameters for the hopping part of the hamiltonian are @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "for the coulomb part of hamiltonian  , we can use the standard parametrization : the on - site coulomb ( hubbard ) repulsion on the same orbital @xmath101 , and that on different orbitals @xmath102 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the hund s rule coupling constant .",
    "note here that the latter relationship is valid only for the unscreened coulomb potential and can be violated in real transition metal compounds since @xmath10 is usually screened more by surrounding ligands than the purely intra - atomic parameter @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite in the general case , other slater integrals , not only @xmath10 and @xmath20 , may enter  @xcite ; we use below this , the so called kanamori parametrization , which in most cases is sufficient .    assuming that @xmath103",
    ", we can change over to an effective hamiltonian that acts on the subspace of functions with singly occupied sites .",
    "the calculation is standard ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in the first approximation @xmath104",
    ", the result is the symmetrical su(4 ) model @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the spin operator of @xmath36 electron at site @xmath43 defined as @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the pseudospin operator for the orbital degree of freedom at site @xmath43 defined as @xmath109 ( @xmath110 are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "notice that the same @xmath111 operators corresponds to different orbitals at the neighboring sites ( since the neighboring face - sharing anion octahedra are rotated with respect to each other ) .",
    "a more general form of the spin - orbital hamiltonian with the finite hund s rule coupling @xmath20 is presented in appendix c.    thus , the transition metal compounds with face - sharing octahedra could provide the closest realization of the high - symmetry spin  orbital model .",
    "the leading term of the exchange @xmath32 has the high su(4 ) symmetry , but the terms of higher order containing the hund s rule coupling constant would have a more complicated form , see appendix c. the ground state of this general hamiltonian including terms @xmath112 , in the the mean - field approximation is well known to be ferromagnetic in spin and antiferromagnetic in pseudospin .",
    "@xcite in general , however , quantum effects related to the su(4 ) symmetry may favor other types of states , and the total resulting type of the ground state requires a special analysis .    the value of the effective electron ",
    "electron hopping @xmath113 depends on the details of the crystal structure , in particular , on the m1o ",
    "m2 angle . note that at some values of this angle , the contribution of the m1o ",
    "m2 exchange via oxygens can vanish ( see appendix b ) , and such case should be treated separately .",
    "there are many materials , which have the orbital filling corresponding to the present case .",
    "these are not only well - known v@xmath6o@xmath5 and bavs@xmath5 , but also many other @xmath114 and especially @xmath115 and @xmath116 transition metal compounds , such as ba@xmath7ru@xmath5o@xmath33 and baruo@xmath5 .",
    "as was mentioned above , even in the case of ideal mo@xmath0 octahedra , there exists the trigonal symmetry , which is inherent to face - sharing geometry .",
    "the trigonal crystal field acts on the triplet @xmath2 level further splitting it into a doublet @xmath117 and a singlet @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding part of the hamiltonian due to a trigonal field can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the unit operator , @xmath121 is the angular momentum operator in the basis of trigonal axes , and parameter @xmath122 can be positive or negative .",
    "we now analyze the sign of the possible contributions to @xmath122 .",
    "the trigonal field due to a distortion of the octahedra can have both signs , positive for an elongation and negative for a compression of the octahedra along the trigonal axis .",
    "the trigonal field due to the neighboring magnetic cations forming 1d structures is always positive ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the singlet is the lowest energy state for @xmath124 and the doublet for @xmath125 .    in the trigonal coordinate system , we have the @xmath3 singlet , latexmath:[\\[|a_1\\rangle =    @xmath4 , @xmath127 for an ion m1 , and the same singlet @xmath128 and a doublet , @xmath129 for the nearest neighbor ion m2 .",
    "it has to be mentioned that these expressions for the wave functions [ and eqs .",
    " ] are given for the case of the ideal mo@xmath0 octahedra , where m  o  m angle is about 70.5@xmath31 .",
    "the trigonal distortions will mix @xmath4 and @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "more detailed calculations , which take into account such modification of the wave function due to trigonal distortions are presented in appendix  [ td ] .",
    "this mixing , however , only changes some numerical coefficients and does not change the main conclusion that there exist only equal diagonal hoppings , the hopping between different orbitals being zero  the conditions important for getting su(4 ) model  .    here , we consider the electronic configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ figstruct]b : the @xmath3 level has energy lower than that for the @xmath4 level . the conditions for the existence of such a configuration are discussed in appendix a. further on , we assume that the @xmath3 level is fully occupied , there is one electron at the doubly degenerate @xmath4 level , and the upper @xmath1 levels are empty . in this case , we can use 1d two - band hubbard hamiltonian in the form of eq .  , but now orbital indices @xmath45 take the values @xmath130 , @xmath131 for the m1 sites ( odd @xmath43 ) or @xmath132 , @xmath133 for the m2 sites ( even @xmath43 ) . the hopping amplitudes @xmath134 are the sum of the direct @xmath22@xmath22 and indirect ( via ligands ) hopping amplitudes . note that our analysis is relevant also for the case of negative but large in absolute value @xmath41 , when the empty @xmath3 level lies far above the @xmath4 level with one electron .    for the direct @xmath22@xmath22 hopping",
    ", we have now @xmath135 to find the relations for the hopping via ligands , we can use the consideration similar to that used in the previous section , but with the replacement @xmath136 repeating after this substitution all calculations as described above , we obtain that the hopping amplitudes have again the symmetric form @xmath137 where direct hopping amplitude @xmath138 is given by eq .  , while the hopping amplitude via ligands , @xmath93 , is obtained in appendix b [ eq .  ] .",
    "thus , the same arguments as those presented in the previous section show that for one electron ( or hole ) at @xmath4 levels ( neglecting the contribution of @xmath3 states ) , the effective spin ",
    "orbital hamiltonian for a chain of face - sharing octahedra would have the same form of eq .",
    "as for  real \" @xmath36 orbitals , including the su(4 ) part , eq .  , and if necessary the extra terms  @xcite @xmath112 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "this form of the effective hamiltonian is , in fact , a consequence of the lattice symmetry : @xmath4 and @xmath1 are similar representations of the same point group .",
    "moreover , taking into account trigonal distortions of the metal  ligand octahedra and the coulomb interaction between cations in the chain does not change the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( see appendix  [ td ] below ) .",
    "in the present paper , we considered the effective spin  orbital exchange for the `` third case '' ( as compared to the first two well - known cases of mo@xmath0 octahedra with common corner and common edge ) , namely , the case of local geometry with face - sharing mo@xmath0 octahedra .",
    "the trigonal distortions are inherent to such systems .",
    "they determine the symmetry of the problem , splitting the @xmath2 levels to those with @xmath3 and @xmath139 orbitals and reduce it to appropriate spin  orbital model with pseudospin-1/2 .",
    "we show that resulting effective spin ",
    "orbital hamiltonian in this situation is a well known symmetric kugel ",
    "khomskii model , eq .  , or , in a more complete form , eq .  ( c1 ) , both for the @xmath1 and @xmath139 orbitals .",
    "the leading terms of the model have the su(4 ) symmetry . in that sense , the situation with face - sharing geometry is very different from the usually considered cases of mo@xmath0 octahedra with a common corner ( m1o  m2 angle @xmath25 ) and with a common edge ( m1o  m2 angle @xmath140 ) .",
    "this result is important in several respects .",
    "first of all , it points out a class of real physical systems , for which the spin  orbital model of su(4 ) symmetry can be applied .",
    "this opens the possibility to experimentally check some nontrivial predictions of this model , such as strong spin ",
    "orbital entanglement and crucial role of quantum effects .",
    "second , it is instructive to compare the general tendencies existing for three typical geometries : those of mo@xmath0 octahedra with a common corner ( one common oxygen for two neighboring mo@xmath0 octahedra ) , common edge ( two common oxygens ) , and a common face ( three common oxygens ) .",
    "the general conclusions in the better known first and second cases are rather different . for the common - corner geometry , the typical well - known rule is that the ferro - orbital ordering gives antiferromagnetic spin alignment , and _ vice versa_.",
    "@xcite however , this is not true for the case of common edges , with @xmath140 m1o ",
    "m2 bonds : in this situation , often one has ferromagnetic spin ordering irrespective of orbital occupation .",
    "@xcite in that sense , the situation with face - sharing octahedra leading , e.g. , to hamiltonian   is more similar to that with a common corner than to the situation with a common edge : ferro - spins coexist with antiferro - orbitals and _ vice versa_. on the other hand , as stressed in appendix b , for the superexchange via ligands ( but not for direct @xmath141 hopping ! ) the leading terms in the exchange @xmath142 ^ 2/u$ ] can drop out for certain values of the m1o ",
    "m2 angle , similar to the case of common - edge geometry .",
    "thus , the systems with face - sharing geometry represent a class of their own , and they have to be considered as such .",
    "our treatment is focused on the specific features related to such geometry , and the resulting picture turns out to be quite interesting .    turning to real systems ,",
    "several factors not considered in the present paper may become important , which could decrease the symmetry of the resulting model .",
    "one is the electron - lattice ( jahn  teller ) interaction , which , in principle , could lead to orbital ordering independent of the spin one ; in systems like cscucl@xmath5 , for example , it could result in helicoidal superstructures ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the second one , considered in detail in the appendix b , is the strong trigonal distortion of mo@xmath0 octahedra , which for particular situations can strongly reduce the m  o  m contribution to the superexchange , so that for certain m  o  m angle , only the direct @xmath141 contribution remains . in this case",
    ", one may need to take into account higher - order terms @xmath112 in the superexchange hamiltonian .",
    "these terms , written down in the general expression ( c1 ) presented in appendix  c , have less symmetric form in orbital variables @xmath143 ; i.e. , they can also violate the su(4 ) symmetry . nevertheless , pronounced quantum effects typical of the su(4 ) model with its intrinsic strong spin - orbital entanglement can still can still be dominant and determine the type of the ground state of the system . however , even if the type of the ground state at @xmath24 would be determined by these symmetry - breaking terms ( with the energy scale @xmath144 , which is are typically about 10% of the main su(4 ) term of the order of @xmath145 ) , there would exist a broad temperature range @xmath146 , in which the behavior would be determined by the su(4 ) physics .",
    "however , the situation taking place in each particular real system requires a special treatment .",
    "as far as real materials are concerned , one more issue is worth discussing . whereas the situation with common corner and common edge geometry is met in all cases , 3d , 2d , and 1d , common - face geometry in this sense",
    "is more  choosy \" : it is typical for one - dimensional systems ( cscucl@xmath5 , bacoo@xmath5 ) , and often such face - sharing octahedra exist for just dimers or linear trimers ( e.g. in bairo@xmath5 ) .",
    "we are not aware of any real substances with the 2d or 3d face - sharing geometry , although we can not exclude such cases in principle . as to the exchange in such hypothetical situations",
    ", we can give some arguments that in this case for real @xmath36 systems the resulting hamiltonian would also be in a first approximation su(4)-symmetric , but for the @xmath2 levels it would not be the case , because the choice of relevant @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbital would depend on the direction and be different for different nearest neighbors .",
    "the 1d systems , however , should not necessarily involve straight chains ; there may be zigzag or even spiral chains . in all such cases , the su(4 ) physics",
