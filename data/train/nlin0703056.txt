    "understanding the behaviour of the relative separation between two fluid particles in a generic flow is a difficult task of paramount importance . the most intuitive application of this concept is represented by the passive scalar problem , where the eulerian description in terms of fields has its lagrangian counterpart just in the study of fluid trajectories @xcite .",
    "+ while in the one - dimensional situation general considerations and results can be carried out ( at least for smooth flows ) , only few cases are known to be solvable in higher dimension @xcite ; namely , a short - correlated strain ( fully solvable ) , a 2d slow strain @xcite and the large - dimensionality case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe another situation which allows exact analytical calculations : the telegraph - noise model for the velocity gradient in the batchelor regime @xcite .",
    "this means that the relative separation between two fluid particles , @xmath0 , evolves according to @xmath1 and the lagrangian strain ( scalar or matrix ) @xmath2 is assumed as properly made up of a telegraph noise @xcite .",
    "we shall study both the 1d ( compressible ) and the incompressible 2d cases .",
    "the telegraph noise is a stationary random process , @xmath3 , which satisfies the markov property and only takes two values , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "this type of noise has often been used to mimic more general colored noise in stochastic theories and has also been applied , e.g. , to optics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an interesting application of the `` telegraph concept '' to turbulence can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ 1d ] we will study the 1d case . in section [ 2d ] we will move to 2d , first describing a simple peculiar situation ( the hyperbolic flow , [ hypf ] ) and then the general incompressible isotropic case ; the latter will be analysed at first in its complete form , then ( respectively in subsections [ erd ] and [ qdcc ] ) by means of a simplified dynamics and eventually in the quasi - delta - correlated limit .",
    "conclusions follow in section [ conc ] .",
    "the appendices are devoted to the quasi - deterministic limit ( [ app1 ] ) and to some calculation details ( [ app2 ] ) .",
    "the simplest meaningful model , making use of the telegraph noise , for the 1d case , consists in assuming a strain function with the property ( i ) , i.e. @xmath20 indeed , the problem is intimately compressible locally , i.e.  within every single single realization of the noise , but we want the average ( 1d ) `` volume '' not to explode or shrink asymptotically in time . if we denote the long - time evolution of the moments of the interparticle distance with ) is such that @xmath21 always keeps the same sign .",
    "therefore , throughout this section , negative separations can also be considered , but they are to be dealt with either in absolute value or as the ratio @xmath22 . ] @xmath23 this means that we have to impose the constraint @xmath24 from ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ sas ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain the system of the two first - order ordinary differential equations which describe the time evolution of moments .",
    "it is indeed sufficient to multiply the starting equation by the noise itself ( taken at the same time ) in order to get a closed system , thanks to the simplicity of the telegraph form .",
    "namely , if we define @xmath25 and rewrite accordingly @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27r^n(t)\\ ] ] and thus @xmath28 we must then look for the evolution equation of @xmath29 , which is readily done by exploiting ( [ fod ] ) : @xmath30 taking ( [ rn0 ] ) into account , the first term on the right - hand side becomes @xmath31 ^ 2r^n(t)\\rangle+n\\alpha_0\\langle{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(t)r^n(t)\\rangle\\\\   & \\!\\!=\\!\\!&\\!\\!na^2\\langle r^n(t)\\rangle+n\\alpha_0 ^ 2\\langle r^n(t)\\rangle-2\\alpha_0\\langle[{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(t)+\\alpha_0]r^n(t)\\rangle\\\\   & & \\!\\!+n\\alpha_0\\langle{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(t)r^n(t)\\rangle\\\\   & \\!\\!=\\!\\!&\\!\\!na^2\\langle r^n(t)\\rangle - n\\alpha_0 ^ 2\\langle r^n(t)\\rangle - n\\alpha_0\\langle{\\tilde{\\alpha}}(t)r^n(t)\\rangle\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we made use of the property stated in ( i ) .",
    "consequently , ( [ arn1 ] ) rewrites as @xmath32 equations ( [ rn ] ) and ( [ arn2 ] ) constitute the system we were looking for .",
    "it is easy to recast the latter as a second - order differential equation for the quantity @xmath33 alone , which can then be solved exactly : @xmath34 constraint ( [ g10 ] ) applied to ( [ errenne ] ) implies @xmath35 the latter is a convex function with asymptotic behaviour @xmath36 and symmetric with respect to the quadratic minimum @xmath37 the mean value @xmath38 turns out to be negative but its modulus can not clearly exceed @xmath39 , which means that only situations with @xmath40 ( the analogue of the kubo number ) smaller than unity are physically relevant in this picture .",
    "another interesting consequence is the relation @xmath41 , which reduces from three to two the number of free parameters in the original definition ( [ sas ] ) of the strain .",
    "this means that the lower level of the noise persists longer : in the lagrangian frame , indeed , particles spend longer time in contracting regions than in expanding ones , thus enhancing the weight of the former in the statistics .",
    "accordingly , the lyapunov exponent , computed as the derivative of ( [ alfagamma ] ) taken in the origin , turns out to be negative @xcite : @xmath42    the joint probability density function @xmath43 can also be investigated .",
    "it satisfies the second - order partial differential equation @xcite @xmath44+a^2\\partial_r(rp)=0\\;.\\ ] ] equation ( [ prob ] ) has no stationary solutions , as both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are non - normalizable .",

    "the cramr function @xmath50 is simply the legendre transform of @xmath51 : @xmath52 it is a convex function vanishing quadratically at the minimum , represented by the lyapunov exponent , @xmath53 , and it approaches vertically the boundaries of its compact domain : @xmath54 moreover , it satisfies the evans  searles  gallavotti  cohen fluctuation relation @xmath55 @xcite despite the time irreversibility of the strain statistics @xcite . + plugging ( [ cramer ] ) into ( [ pro ] )",

    "in a 2d environment it is possible to consistently impose the incompressibility constraint locally , for every single realization of the noise . for the sake of simplicity , we shall only consider this situation , which implies the strain matrix to be traceless . + before studying the general isotropic case , we would like to show a simpler instance of flow , namely the hyperbolic one , where a simplification is possible .",
    "let us consider the incompressible irrotational flow described by the diagonal strain matrix @xmath61 the streamlines are represented by fixed equilateral hyperbolae , which are however travelled by fluid particles in randomly - reversing direction . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the velocity gradients are assumed to have equal reversal probabilities and constant absolute values , which justifies the use of the telegraph signal @xmath19 with the properties described in ( iii ) .",
    "+ from the analytical point of view , the quantities of our interest which can be investigated are of the type @xmath62 with integer @xmath63 . by means of straightforward algebra ,",
    "one gets the evolution @xmath64t/2}+\\mathcal{b}_{n , k}{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\left[\\sqrt{\\nu^2 + 4(2k - n)^2a^2}-\\nu\\right]t/2}\\;,\\ ] ] which implies @xmath65 for positive even @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , by extrapolation , @xmath67 which physically reflects the fact that the velocity changes its sign with equal probabilities in both directions , thus preventing the interparticle distance from exploding exponentially .",

    "it is evident that , at long times , such probability must factorize into a product of single - coordinate probabilities , in the sense that the problem can be reduced to a pair of independent , one - dimensional problems described in footnote [ note ] .",
    "exploiting this fact , we obtain the final result @xmath71}/a^2t^2-\\sqrt{1-\\ln^2[r_2/r_2(0)]}/a^2t^2\\right)\\nu t/2}/|r_1r_2|\\;.\\ ] ]      we now turn to analyse the general isotropic flow described by the strain matrix @xmath72 the noises @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are independent of one another but share the properties in ( iii ) with the same coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath76 , which can now range from @xmath77 to @xmath78 independently . differently from the 1d case ( see footnote [ note ] ) , we will see that this is enough to mimic a realistic situation .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 thus turns out to be singular and nilpotent : @xmath80 .",
    "+ by means of simple manipulations , analogue to those described for the 1d case , one can write down a closed system for the coordinates @xmath81 defined in ( [ rnk ] ) at every @xmath66 , in the form @xmath82 the column vector @xmath83 has dimension @xmath84 , being made up of : the @xmath85 components of @xmath86 itself , the @xmath87 components of @xmath86 times one noise , the @xmath87 components of @xmath86 times two ( distinct ) noises , and finally the @xmath85 components of @xmath86 times all the three noises .",
    "no other quantity is required to close the system , because as soon as a noise appears as square it becomes a deterministic quantity and can be taken out of the statistical average .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 is thus of order @xmath89 and turns out to be dependent only on @xmath39 and @xmath76 .",
    "+ in order to take also rotation into account properly , the presence of three noises is necessary and sufficient ; one can easily understand that such number would sharply increase in higher dimensions , thus strongly enhancing the number of components in @xmath83 : this is why we confine ourselves to the 2d case .",
    "+ to study the long - time evolution of @xmath90 , one should then look for the eigenvalues of @xmath88 and identify the one with largest positive real part .",
    "this is not an easy task from the numerical point of view for growing @xmath66 , and it does not look feasible analytically for a generic @xmath66 , even if the matrix itself can be easily written down as a function of @xmath66 ( see appendix [ app2 ] for details ) .",
    "in particular , we performed the full calculation and we found the whole spectrum for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "+ the evolution of the linear components @xmath93 and @xmath94 is very easy to describe : the largest eigenvalue is @xmath77 , which means that they do not show any exponential growth at large times ; however , as they can change sign , this does not yield any information on @xmath95 , i.e.  on @xmath96 .",
    "+ the situation is much more meaningful for quadratic components ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) , because in this case the largest eigenvalue is given by @xmath100{216a^2\\nu+3\\sqrt{5184a^4\\nu^2 - 3\\nu^6}}}+\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{216a^2\\nu+3\\sqrt{5184a^4\\nu^2 - 3\\nu^6}}}{3}\\;,\\ ] ] which is always positive and behaves asymptotically as @xmath101&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to0\\\\[0.3 cm ]    \\displaystyle2\\sqrt[3]{2a^2\\nu}-\\nu\\left[1+o\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{a}\\right)^{2/3}\\right]&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\;.   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the eigenvalue @xmath102 expresses the exponential growth rate of @xmath103 and thus coincides with the point @xmath104 on the curve @xmath51 .      as already pointed out ,",
    "this general process is computationally very demanding and therefore has not been carried out for @xmath105 .",
    "the following step thus consists in trying to find a reduced dynamics , i.e.  a subset of components of @xmath83 such that the corresponding rows in @xmath88 are nonzero only in columns whose index has been taken into account in the reduced subset .",
    "+ the first hint into this direction is provided by a more careful look at the matrices @xmath88 , or equivalently at the corresponding system of equations . for instance , taking @xmath106 into account , one can see ( from appendix [ app2 ] ) that the rows number 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 13 and 15 form a closed system , and the same is for the remaining 8 rows : we have thus reduced from a single @xmath107 problem to a couple of @xmath108 independent problems .",
    "the same half - splitting can be easily verified directly for @xmath109 and is expected to take place also for higher @xmath66 , thus contributing to a strong simplification .",
    "+ however , a much heavier simplification can be obtained , even doing without any approximation and thus considering exact relations . here",
    ", the key idea is that we are not interested in studying the time behaviour in itself of every single component of @xmath110 with @xmath111 ( i.e.  of the quantities constructed by multiplying the coordinates @xmath81 by some noises ) , but we simply need some combinations of them in order to describe correctly the dynamics of the first @xmath85 components ; moreover , not necessarily all the latter quantities are of our interest , but only a combination or a subset of them .",
    "+ to be more specific , let us consider again @xmath106 .",
    "looking at the coefficients which appear in the first row , which describes the evolution of @xmath112 , it is natural to consider the following linear combination : third row , plus sixth row , plus eighth row times @xmath113 .",
    "in other words , we are noticing that the left product of @xmath106 with the row vector @xmath114 gives the vector @xmath115 times @xmath39 .",
    "we thus have to perform @xmath116 , and it can easily be seen that the result is @xmath117 . basically , we are down to a @xmath118 matrix ( note that @xmath119 ) with zeros on one line and @xmath120 on the other : its eigenvalues are trivially 0 and @xmath121 ; 0 being the larger one , in accordance with the result from the complete form .",
    "it is clear that the same result also holds considering the evolution of @xmath122 ( second line of @xmath106 ) , i.e.  @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "+ let us turn to @xmath109 .",
    "our aim is to find the behaviour of @xmath125 , therefore let us begin with adding up the first and third lines , corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath99 respectively . in formulas , if @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 , with @xmath128 .",
    "then we compute @xmath129 , where @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we are able to close the system with @xmath131 .",
    "the resulting @xmath132 matrix ( notice that @xmath133 ) is thus @xmath134 and its eigenvalues satisfy @xmath135 which gives the value of @xmath102 reported in ( [ mu ] ) as the solution with largest positive real part .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the highest nonzero component in the vectors @xmath136 is the last but three , which means that the final 3 components of @xmath137 ( which correspond to the coordinates @xmath138 times all three noises ) are not involved at all in the dynamics of @xmath139 .",
    "+ having tested this simplification to @xmath140 on the already - solved cases @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we now turn to higher @xmath66 , but we confine ourselves to even values .",
    "indeed , @xmath141 by definition for positive even @xmath66 , thus the corresponding points @xmath51 can be extracted from the knowledge of @xmath142 of the first @xmath85 components in @xmath83 . on the contrary , this is not the case for the odd @xmath66 s , which behave similarly to non - natural @xmath66 s because they involve nonlinear operations ( in this case a square root ) that do not commute with the statistical average @xmath143 .",
    "+ in particular , we analysed the values @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 . adopting a technique similar to the one described in the previous paragraphs , one gets matrices of order 5 , 7 and 9 respectively ( i.e.  @xmath85 ) ,",
    "whose characteristic polynomials are : @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 the respective roots with largest positive real part behave asymptotically as : @xmath150   \\displaystyle2\\sqrt[5]{36a^4\\nu}&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\ ; , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath151   \\displaystyle2\\sqrt[7]{1800a^6\\nu}&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\ ; , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath152   \\displaystyle2\\sqrt[9]{181440a^8\\nu}&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\;. \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] these relations provide us with three points of the curve @xmath51 in the asymptotic conditions , to which three more can be added : besides the already - mentioned @xmath104 , one should indeed remember that both @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( in 2d ) must vanish @xcite .",
    "a simple extrapolation then suggests the following asymptotic behaviours : @xmath155    \\displaystyle g(n)a^{n/(n+1)}\\nu^{1/(n+1)}&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\;.   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath156 can be proven rigorously to be @xmath157 ( see the next subsection ) , while such a proof does not look feasible for @xmath158 .",
    "however , starting from the quadratic form of the former , one can guess a fourth - order polynomial for the latter , @xmath159 , and the correctness of this expression seems to be confirmed by the fact that it satisfies the six conditions in @xmath160 despite possessing only five degrees of freedom . as the following coefficients in the power expansion at small @xmath40 are expected to show higher powers of @xmath66 ,",
    "such an expansion is not uniform in the sense that it must fail for some ( large enough ) value of @xmath66 . on the contrary ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath161 must originate from some combinatorics , but has not been identified yet , while the presence of non - integer powers of @xmath39 and @xmath76 suggests that the large-@xmath40 development is singular .",
    "it is worth noticing the dependence of the growth rate of the @xmath66-th moment as a function of the noise correlation time ( inverse of @xmath76 ) : we have a linear growth when the latter is small and a power - law decay when it is large .",
    "+ from ( [ ggg ] ) , exploiting the knowledge of @xmath156 and the vanishing of @xmath162 , we get the asymptotic behaviours of the ( positive , as expected ) lyapunov exponent : @xmath163    \\displaystyle g'(0)\\nu&\\displaystyle\\textrm{for } \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\to\\infty\\;.   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]      the results obtained in the previous subsection are exact , but they have been obtained for specific values of @xmath66 , and the generalization of the coefficients ( [ ggg ] ) as functions of @xmath66 was empirical .",
    "there is however at least one instance in which rigorous analytical results can be obtained : it is provided by the quasi delta - correlated case , corresponding to small @xmath40 .",
    "+ it is worth reminding that in the exactly delta - correlated case @xcite the probability distribution of @xmath21 is lognormal , the cramr function is quadratic and the lyapunov exponent is given by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the multiplicative constant in the well - known expression for the spatial part of the two - point structure function of the velocity field .",
    "a comparison with ( [ lam ] ) suggests the correspondence @xmath166 , which means that the correct limit is @xmath167 such that @xmath168 but @xmath169 keeps finite .",
    "+ the key point in this limit is that the leading behaviour can be extracted rigorously , for any natural @xmath66 , from a restricted dynamics , namely keeping into account only the first @xmath170 components in @xmath83 ( corresponding to the average of the coordinates @xmath81 , and of the latter times one noise ) . to show this , for any quantity @xmath171",

    "+ let us then proceed as follows . from the inspection of the system ( [ eqdiff ] ) and of the following orders , it is apparent that the structure of the equations is such that the degree @xmath188 of the leading behaviour in time ( i.e.  the quantity reported in the table ) can grow of one unity only when a quantity of the second group , of order @xmath187 and time degree @xmath188 , acts as a source term for a quantity of the first group of order @xmath195 , which therefore gets a degree @xmath196 .",

    ", the components of the third and of the fourth group can give rise to linear terms in the first group only for @xmath186 and @xmath198 respectively , which are clearly subdominant with respect both to the quadratic and cubic behaviours of these same components ( @xmath199 and @xmath200 in the table ) and to the linear behaviour found for @xmath180 due to the forcing by the second group .",
    "back to the initial dynamics @xmath201 , this amounts to say that in the evolution equation for @xmath90 one should keep the complete form into account , while for @xmath202 one can neglect all source terms involving two different noises : the system thus closes at this stage , reducing the order of the corresponding matrix from the initial @xmath84 to @xmath170 . in other words ,",

    "in other words , we rewrite ( [ secord ] ) as @xmath209 moreover , interpreting ( [ hat ] ) as @xmath210 where @xmath211 , it is easy to show that the largest - positive - real - part eigenvalue @xmath191 ( divided by @xmath169 ) that we are looking for must belong to the spectrum of the subset matrix @xmath207 , because the remaining eigenvalues are all @xmath121 .",
    "such subset matrix is tridiagonal centrosymmetric but not symmetric , which means that left and right eigenvectors differ .",
    "it is a simple task to prove that the value @xmath157 ( guessed for @xmath212 asymptotically from the previous subsection ) is actually an eigenvalue , but it is not possible to use a variational method to show that it has the largest positive real part .",
    "however , this is not needed , because the row vector built with the @xmath142 components of the binomial coefficient @xmath213 , @xmath214 for @xmath215 , happens to be the left eigenvector of @xmath207 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath157 . therefore , using ( [ binom ] ) and ( [ hat ] ) , one has : @xmath216 this implies @xmath217\\ ] ] as expected .",
    "+ notice that the next - leading correction can not be captured at this stage , because of the approximation introduced previously . to take it into account correctly",
    ", one should reformulate the analysis performed in this section , including also quantities like @xmath218 but however excluding @xmath219 , i.e.  considering a reduced dynamics in the first @xmath181 components of @xmath83 . + it is worth mentioning that an analysis like the previous one , but applied to odd @xmath66 s , leads to @xmath220 in accordance e.g.  with the exact result @xmath221 found with the complete dynamics .",
    "however , as already pointed out , such values are not related to the curve @xmath51 .",
    "lastly , one would be interested in reformulating the previous study in the quasi - deterministic limit , @xmath222 ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible , because the limit turns out to be singular : an exponential growth is expected in general for finite @xmath40 , but a power law is found when this ratio is infinite . in other words , an expansion like ( [ series ] ) with @xmath40 inverted does not work . in ( [ ggg ] ) this reflects into the presence of non - integer powers and into the difference between the limits @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "by assuming the telegraph - noise model for the velocity gradient ( or strain matrix ) , we were able to carry out analytical computations and to obtain several results on the separation between two fluid particles .",
    "focusing on smooth flows ( batchelor regime ) , we firstly analysed the one - dimensional compressible case , finding explicit expressions for the long - time evolution of the interparticle - distance moments ( [ alfagamma ] ) , the lyapunov exponent ( [ lambda ] ) and the cramr function ( [ cramer ] )",
    ". then we concentrated on the two - dimensional incompressible situation and provided an elementary extension of the 1d case , represented by the hyperbolic flow . moving to the general isotropic case",
    ", a thorough analysis on the complete dynamics was made for the evolution of linear ( @xmath91 ) and quadratic ( @xmath92 ) components .",
    "due to high computational cost , at higher @xmath66 we focused on a restricted , though exact , dynamics : however , only specific values of @xmath66 could be studied in this way , leading to the extrapolations ( [ ggg ] ) and ( [ lam ] ) .",
    "such guess was rigorously proved in the quasi - delta - correlated limit , for which approximated equations were introduced .",
