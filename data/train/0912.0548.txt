    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a planned nasa ",
    "esa gravitational - wave ( gw ) observatory sensitive in the @xmath3@xmath4 hz range @xcite .",
    "lisa s data will contain superposed signals from millions of sources , including all the binaries in the galaxies with orbital periods below five hours and massive  black - hole ( mbh ) binary coalescences out to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thousands of sources will be resolvable individually . the potential for source confusion and the very complex dynamics and waveforms of sources such as extreme ",
    "mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) , suggested the need for a coordinated effort to develop and demonstrate lisa data - analysis capabilities .",
    "the mock lisa data challenges ( mldcs ) began in early 2006 with this very purpose .",
    "the complexity and ambition of the challenges has risen with each round : mldc 1 @xcite focused on simple sources , isolated or moderately interfering ; mldc 2 @xcite introduced a galactic _ ensemble _ of 26 million binaries ( 20,000 of which were successfully recovered ) , as well as the problem of detecting mbh binaries over the galactic cacophony ; mldc 1b @xcite reprised the first challenge for new research collaborations joining the effort , and saw the first successful detections of emri signals .",
    "mldc 3 , released in april 2008 and due in april 2009 , consisted of five subchallenges that featured more realistic models of previously examined sources ( chirping galactic binaries in mldc 3.1 , spinning mbh binary inspirals in 3.2 , superposed emris in 3.3 ) and entirely new sources ( gw bursts from cosmic - string cusps in 3.4 , an isotropic stochastic background in 3.5 ) ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the source models and gw content of each subchallenge .",
    "fifteen collaborations , comprising all the participants listed in the byline and most task - force members , submitted a total of seventeen entries ( all can be found at www.tapir.caltech.edu/~mldc/results3 together with technical notes about search implementation ) .    in this paper we briefly report on the detection and parameter - estimation performance demonstrated by each entry .",
    "altogether , mldc 3 showed substantial progress in tackling increasingly difficult data - analysis problems , and introduced new search methods such as nested sampling and sophisticated genetic optimization ",
    "markov chain hybrids .",
    "however , there is certainly room for improvement and further work : fewer galactic binaries were recovered by the searches employed here than by the multi - source mcmc demonstrated in mldc 2 ; mbh binaries and emris were detected with high confidence , but the accurate estimation of their parameters ( beyond the dominant ones ) was stymied by the complex global structure and the many local maxima of likelihood surfaces . on the bright side , searches for cosmic - string bursts and stochastic backgrounds ( admittedly simple problems in the absence of nonstationary or non - gaussian instrument noise ) met no roadblocks .",
    "section [ sec : mldc4 ] of this article introduces mldc 4 , which is being released as we write ( november 2009 ) , with entries due at the end of 2010 .",
    "challenge dataset 3.1 contained signals from over 60 million chirping galactic binaries .",
    "the vast majority of these are too weak to be isolated , and the unresolved component forms a nonstationary confusion noise that adds to the overall noise level .",
    "estimates based on self - consistent removal schemes @xcite and bayesian model selection @xcite suggest that it should be possible to recover between 20,000 and 30,000 binaries .",
    "three groups submitted source catalogs for mldc 3.1 :    * * bhamuib * ( a collaboration between the universities of birmingham and the balearic islands ) implemented a delayed - rejection mcmc algorithm @xcite to search three narrow frequency windows , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , using the mldc waveform generator @xcite . a total of 494 sources were reported . *",
    "* aeirit * ( researchers at the albert einstein institute in hannover , germany , and the rochester institute of technology ) set up a ligo - style hierarchical search based on the @xmath9-statistic and on frequency - domain rigid - adiabatic templates @xcite .",
    "triggers are generated for the individual tdi channels ; those found in coincidence are analyzed coherently using noise - orthogonal tdi observables .",
    "a total of 1940 sources were reported . * * powrwa * ( a collaboration between the albert einstein institute , the university of wrocaw , and the polish academy of sciences ) adopted an iterative matched - filtering search that used the @xmath9-statistic and rigid - adiabatic templates @xcite , and analyzed a few 0.1-mhz wide frequency bands . the brightest source in each band is identified and removed , and the process repeated until a pre - set snr threshold is reached .",
    "a total of 14,838 sources were reported .    the entries for this round fell short of the theoretical target for a variety of reasons .",
    "bhamuib analyzed only a small fraction of the data , while aeirit and powrwa used single - pass or iterative search schemes , which are limited in how deep they can dig before source confusion degrades signal recovery .",
    "previous studies  @xcite indicate that it should be possible to recover approximately 99% of the resolvable sources to an accuracy of better than 90% , as measured by the overlap between injected and recovered waveforms .",
    "we therefore adopt correlation as the metric by which the entries are measured .    for this",
    "we need to identify the injected signal that corresponds most closely to each recovered signal . to do this , we consider all injected signals with @xmath10 within six frequency bins of the recovered signal , and we select the injected signal with the minimum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the injected and recovered waveforms , and @xmath14 denotes the standard noise - weighted inner product , summed over the noise - orthogonal @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 tdi channels .",
    "the correlation is then computed as @xmath18 . using as a figure of merit the percentage of recovered sources with @xmath19",
    ", we find 30% for bhamuib , 95% for aeirit , 33% for powrwa .",
    "powrwa have reported a bug in their code that affects sources with frequencies above 3 mhz .",
    "results are better after correcting it @xcite . if we consider only the 6,955 sources they report below 3 mhz , their figure of merit improves to 58% .",
    "challenge dataset 3.2 contained five signals from mbh inspirals , embedded in instrument noise and a partially subtracted galactic background ( see @xcite for a synopsis of the waveform model and for the random selection of source parameters ) .",
    "multi - tdi snrs ranged from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , with the two weakest signals ( mbh-2 and mbh-6 ) corresponding to mergers after the end of the dataset .",
    "five groups submitted entries :    * * aei * ( researchers at the albert einstein institute ) used a genetic matched - filtering algorithm extended to a multi - modal search ; as a merit function they took the @xmath15-statistic , a geometrical mean of the log - likelihood for the signal and for a low - frequency signal subset @xcite . * * cambaei * ( a collaboration between the cambridge cavendish laboratory and institute of astronomy with the the albert einstein institute ) adopted the multinest implementation of nested - sampling integration @xcite to compute the evidence and produce posterior distributions .",
    "this method is intrinsically multimodal , and the @xmath15-statistic was used to identify modes . * * gsfc * ( researchers at goddard space flight center ) employed the tempered  metropolis - hastings mcmc algorithm found in xspec @xcite . *",
    "* jplcitnwu * ( a collaboration between jpl / caltech and northwestern university ) employed a two - stage method whereby they followed up a nonspinning mbh search @xcite with multinest . * * mtgwagapc * ( researchers at montana state university and at the astro - particle and cosmology institute , apc , in paris ) adopted a parallel - tempering mcmc algorithm , evolved from the thermostated , frequency - annealed algorithm employed in previous challenges @xcite .",
    "all five groups recovered parameters for the loud signals ; mbh-2 ( snr @xmath22 19 ) was recovered by aei , cambaei , jplcitnwu and mtgwagapc ; mbh-6 ( snr @xmath22 13 ) by aei , cambaei and mtgwagapc .",
    "participants were encouraged to submit multiple modes of comparable probability , if present . for the best ( highest - snr ) mode in each entry ,",
    "table [ tab : smbh_err ] lists the fractional parameter errors , as well as the recovered snr and individual tdi - channel fitting factors ( ffs ) .",
    "both the recovered snr and the @xmath23 of the true waveform were computed by filtering the noisy dataset ( in its lisa simulator version ) with the appropriate template , while the ffs were computed between noiseless signals .",
    "note that the reported modes had often snr differences of less than one , and the highest - snr mode did not always have the best parameters .",

    "thus , the determination of sky position is intrinsically harder for bursts , and it is further complicated by the presence of degeneracies @xcite such as the reflection of sky position across the instantaneous lisa plane . the bursts barycentric central time",
    "@xmath112 and its polarization are strongly coupled with sky position , and therefore are also determined poorly . to compensate for this fact",
    ", we calculate the error in the arrival time of the burst at the center of the detector constellation @xmath113 .",
    "this parameter has a weaker correlation with the sky position and constrained better by observations .",
    "challenge dataset 3.5 contained an isotropic stochastic background signal immersed in instrument noise , with noise levels slightly randomized as in mldc 3.4 . to facilitate the use of the gw - canceling tdi combination @xmath17 ,",
    "the lisa orbits were approximated as those traced by a rigidly rotating triangle , with equal and constant arm lengths ( except for the sagnac effect ) .",
    "the background was realized by placing @xmath114 linearly polarized , stochastic pseudosources at positions uniformly distributed across the sky .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "now , isotropic stochastic backgrounds can be characterized by a single dimensionless quantity , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the energy density in gws , and @xmath117 is the energy density required to close the universe . in this mldc round , @xmath118 was taken to be constant across frequencies , and in this dataset it was set equal to @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 ) .",
    "two groups submitted entries for this challenge , and both analyzed the same version of the dataset , generated by synthetic lisa @xcite :    * * aeibham * ( a collaboration between the albert einstein institute and the university of birmingham ) submitted multiple entries using different applications of the same mcmc algorithm @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the aeibham analysis of the tdi @xmath15 and @xmath16 observables , which was run separately over frequency bands of 0.11 mhz ( a ) and 0.15 mhz ( b ) .",
    "* * mtgwag * ( montana state university ) analyzed the tdi @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 spectra with parallel - tempering mcmc .",
    "they estimated the background level as well as the levels of select linear combinations of the individual lisa noises ( other combinations are left essentially undetermined by tdi observations ) .",
    "figure [ fig : stochastic_pdf ] shows the reported posterior pdfs and the best - fit values for @xmath118 , along with their fractional error ; both groups recovered the injected value within less than @xmath121 .",
    "figure [ fig : stochastic_pdf ] shows also the best - fit levels reported by mtgwag for the determinable proof - mass and photodetector noise combinations .",
    "the aeibham analyses used theoretical expressions for tdi @xmath15 and @xmath16 noise spectra , which left only their overall levels as unknowns .",
    "however , this treatment assumed that the secondary noises were symmetric , which was not the case in this dataset .",
    "in addition , because of limitations in the mldc stochastic - background generation code , the actual gw strain spectrum differed from the nominal @xmath122 power law at higher frequencies .",
    "this may explain why the aeibham ( b ) result was further from the injected value that either the aeibham ( a ) result ( in which band the gw spectrum was actually @xmath122 ) or the mtgwag result , which used all three tdi channel , solved for their unknown correlations , and calibrated the gw spectrum using training datasets .",
    "while the third round of the mldcs was focused on increasing the complexity and variety of gw sources , we are devoting the next iteration to the _ global - fit _ problem of detecting and analyzing sources of different types superposed in the lisa data .",
    "thus , mdlc 4 consists of a single , `` whole enchilada '' challenge that includes all the sources of mldcs 3.13.5 _ in the same dataset _ , albeit with larger source numbers ( for emris and cosmic - string bursts ) and parameter ranges ( for mbh binaries and emris ) .",
    "see table [ table : mldc4 ] for details .",
    "the duration of the dataset is again approximately two years ( @xmath123 s ) , but the data are released both as a high - cadence time series of @xmath124 samples with @xmath125 s , and as a downsampled time series of @xmath126 samples with @xmath127 s ( however , only the cosmic - string bursts and instrument noise contribute spectral content above 33 mhz ) .     reported by each analysis , their modes @xmath128 , and the corresponding fractional error w.r.t",

    "the horizontal - axis range corresponds to the `` prior '' mldc range .",
    "table on right : estimated lisa noise levels ( modes ) in the mtgwag analysis .",
    "the @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the proof mass noises introduced in the left and right optical assemblies on lisa spacecraft @xmath131 ; likewise for photodetector noises @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the combinations of noises shown in the table are the only ones that are constrained effectively by the data after laser phase noise has been removed with tdi.[fig : stochastic_pdf ] ]    l@+l|ll & mtgwag / true & frac .",

    "in contrast to mldcs 3.4 and 3.5 , all the lisa instrument noises are set to symmetric , nominal levels , and the lisa armlength are allowed to `` breathe . ''",
    "see @xcite for more details about the mldc models of lisa orbits , noises , and interferometric observables .",
    "the waveform models of mldc 3 @xcite are used unchanged in mldc 4 , except for the following : the spectra of cosmic - string bursts are truncated below @xmath3 hz ; the stochastic - background spectrum is @xmath122 between @xmath3 hz and 33 mhz , and drops lower below and above that range ; last , when mbh binaries end within the duration of the dataset , they are terminated at the time @xmath152 when the frequency derivative changes sign , indicating that the pn expansion is failing . to reduce spectral leakage , a half hann window @xmath153 $ ]",
