    "the classical theory of total positivity concerns matrices in which all minors are nonnegative . while this theory was pioneered by gantmacher , krein , and schoenberg in the 1930s ,",
    "the past decade has seen a flurry of research in this area initiated by lusztig @xcite .",
    "motivated by surprising connections he discovered between his theory of canonical bases for quantum groups and the theory of total positivity , lusztig extended this subject by introducing the totally nonnegative variety @xmath3 in an arbitrary reductive group @xmath4 and the totally nonnegative part @xmath5 of a real flag variety @xmath6 .",
    "a few years later , fomin and zelevinsky @xcite advanced the understanding of @xmath3 by studying the decomposition of @xmath4 into double bruhat cells , and rietsch @xcite proved lusztig s conjectural cell decomposition of @xmath5 .",
    "most recently , postnikov @xcite investigated the combinatorics of the totally nonnegative part of a grassmannian @xmath0 : he established a relationship between @xmath0 and planar oriented networks , producing a combinatorially explicit cell decomposition of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we continue postnikov s study of the combinatorics of @xmath0 : in particular , we enumerate the cells in the cell decomposition of @xmath0 according to their dimension .",
    "the _ totally nonnegative part _ of the grassmannian of @xmath7-dimensional subspaces in @xmath8 is defined to be the quotient @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the space of real @xmath11-matrices of rank @xmath7 with nonnegative maximal minors and @xmath12 is the group of real matrices with positive determinant . if we specify which maximal minors are strictly positive and which are equal to zero , we obtain a cellular decomposition of @xmath13 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we refer to the cells in this decomposition as _ totally positive cells_. the set of totally positive cells naturally has the structure of a graded poset : we say that one cell covers another if the closure of the first cell contains the second , and the rank function is the dimension of each cell .",
    "lusztig @xcite has proved that the totally nonnegative part of the ( full ) flag variety is contractible , which implies the same result for any partial flag variety .",
    "( we thank k. rietsch for pointing this out to us . ) the topology of the individual cells is not well understood , however .",
    "postnikov @xcite has conjectured that the closure of each cell in @xmath0 is homeomorphic to a closed ball .    in @xcite ,",
    "postnikov constructed many different combinatorial objects which are in one - to - one correspondence with the totally positive grassmann cells ( these objects thereby inherit the structure of a graded poset ) .",
    "some of these objects include decorated permutations , @xmath14-diagrams , positive oriented matroids , and move - equivalence classes of planar oriented networks .",
    "because it is simple to compute the rank of a particular @xmath14-diagram or decorated permutation , we will restrict our attention to these two classes of objects .",
    "the main result of this paper is an explicit formula for the _ rank generating function _",
    "@xmath15 of @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , @xmath15 is defined to be the polynomial in @xmath2 whose @xmath16 coefficient is the number of totally positive cells in @xmath13 which have dimension @xmath17 . as a corollary of our main result , we give a new proof that the euler characteristic of @xmath0 is @xmath1 . additionally , using our result and exploiting the connection between totally positive cells and permutations , we compute generating functions which enumerate ( regular ) permutations according to two statistics .",
    "this leads to a new @xmath2-analog of the eulerian numbers that has many interesting combinatorial properties .",
    "for example , when we evaluate this @xmath2-analog at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we obtain the eulerian numbers , the narayana numbers , and the binomial coefficients .",
    "finally , the connection with the narayana numbers suggests a way of incorporating noncrossing partitions into a larger family of  crossing \" partitions .",
    "let us fix some notation .",
    "throughout this paper we use @xmath20 $ ] to denote the @xmath2-analog of @xmath21 , that is , @xmath20 = 1+q+ \\dots + q^{i-1}$ ] .",
