    "vastly different behavior is exhibited in the case of very hydrophobic bodies where assembly is facilitated by drying as compared with more hydrophilic bodies where steric interactions engender the expulsion of water at small separations .",
    "we have computed the potential of mean force and hydrodynamic profile for the model pocket for three different strengths of solvent attraction .",

    "these properties have been found to yield trends relatable to those observed for the profile of the friction coefficient in our previous works  @xcite , and this is also observed in the present work .",
    "it is seen that relaxation times greater than @xmath36 ps are present in the cavity near the dewetting transition . as we will show later , this timescale is of the same order as the mean first passage time for the ligand to bind to the pocket starting from entry into the pocket .",
    "such slow fluctuations indicate that the simple one dimensional brownian dynamics approximation does not hold , and non - markovian effects are significant .",

    "[ fig : wetdry]d and for the wet and dry states separately in fig .",
    "[ fig : wetdry]c .",
    "one can see that the relaxation times of the correlation functions are markedly shorter when the states are considered separately .",
    "the friction coefficient in the wet and dry states may be estimated from the correlation function @xmath38 using the approach in refs . @xcite .",
    "the friction in the wet state is close to the value found at large separations , whereas in the dry state it is approximately half of this .",
    "therefore the pronounced hydrodynamic effect we observe at the drying transition in this and prior studies is shown to be due to slow transitions between the wet and dry states , and it is appealing to incorporate this as a separate slow collective variable , whereas other solvent degrees of freedom remain treatable in the markovian limit .",
    "indeed , this is the rationale behind the diffusive surface hopping model .",

    "the long tail of the total correlation function is absent in the wet and dry state results , indicating that the large friction is associated with slow solvent fluctuations due to drying and wetting events.,width=288 ]      the parameterization of our diffusive surface hopping model ( dshm ) draws from the underlying simulation results as obtained in the region of the drying transition . as evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_eq ] ) , the three main inputs necessary for dshm are the mean force and diffusion coefficient along the two surfaces and the rate constants for transitions between wet and dry states . here",
    "we will briefly outline only the salient features of how we construct the dshm using simulation as the source of parameters .",
    "a detailed discussion of the parameterization is reserved for the appendix .",
    "the dshm requires mean forces on the dry and wet surfaces .",
    "it consists of numerous wet and dry states set on a equally spaced grid along @xmath1 . for the purpose of this model ,",
    "a state is defined as dry if there are fewer than 15 water molecules in the pocket , and wet otherwise .",
    "we extract mean `` dry '' and `` wet '' forces by averaging over wet and dry configurations separately at each fixed @xmath1 in the dewetting region .",
    "the resulting potentials of mean forces , which include the direct interactions of heavy bodies , that correspond to the wet and dry surfaces are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mastereq ] .    another crucial set of input parameters for dshm are the rate constants for the transitions , @xmath40 .",
    "such transitions are only treated in the dewetting region .",
    "only wet and dry states are considered at large and small separations , respectively .",
    "the matrix elements are estimated from the average dwell times in the wet state from md simulations at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the reverse transitions are then estimated from the detailed balance condition and the equilibrium probabilities of being in a wet or dry state .",
    "the values of the inverse rate constants at the values of @xmath1 considered are given in table 1 .",
    "the transition times are shown to become shorter as the bodies approach each other and fewer water molecules are displaced by the drying event .",
    "recent work on the rate of drying  @xcite finds that the activation free energy depends on distance through linear and quadratic terms which are related through macroscopic arguments to surface and line tensions .",
    "we find our present data set too sparse to elaborate on this finding . at small separations ,",
    "we include two states on the wet surface for which the solvation state is dry for long times .",
    "the inclusion of such `` transient wet '' states , which may be visited as the ligand diffuses along @xmath1 , place the kinetics of assembly predicted by the model in quantitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulation .    the diffusion coefficient in the dewetting region is taken to be constant , albeit with different values on the wet and dry surfaces ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is taken to be the diffusion constant for the ligand at large separations . in this way ,",
    "the hydrodynamic effect in the dewetting region is subsumed into the wet - to - dry transitions which are an explicit degree of freedom of the dynamics given by eq .",

    "it can be seen that , among all dynamical schemes presently considered , the mfpt obtained from dshm comes closest to the results obtained from md .",
    "the avg - hi result significantly overestimates the mfpt . on the other hand",
    "the mfpt obtained from avg - nohi is a drastic underestimation of the result obtained from simulation , partly because it lacks a description of the drying transition .    in order to gain a more detailed understanding of the kinetics in the drying region ,",
    "we compute the mfpt to assembly from initial wet configurations at pocket - ligand separations where the average surface points downhill towards assembly .",
    "trajectories ( about @xmath44 ) that recross into the region beyond the drying transition are not counted for the purpose of this calculation .",
    "the dshm is in agreement with the results obtained from md .",
    "as expected , the avg - nohi mftp is far too low owing to its lack of a description of the drying phenomena .",
    "interestingly , the avg - hi model yields a reasonable result for one initial condition ( @xmath45 nm ) but not the other ( @xmath46 nm ) .",
    "this result is another manifestation of the spatial shift of the probability distribution discussed above , such that the large hydrodynamic slowdown does not influence the ( avg - hi ) results when the ligand is initially placed to the left of the center peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : probpos ] .",
    "a full assessment of the kinetics of molecular recognition processes calls for the inclusion of molecular - scale hydrodynamic effects .",
    "however , most typically in coarse - grained models such effects are either ignored or treated within markovian limit where the solvent time scales are assumed to be fast compared to those of the heavy bodies . in reality , however slow solvent fluctuations are present when confined water molecules are expelled from the region between the ligand and the pocket wall .",
    "the non - markovian nature of this problem begs for a more comprehensive theory which includes the solvent as an explicit part of the reaction path .",
    "we present a simple model to study the kinetics of ligand binding in a model hydrophobic enclosure in conjunction with a novel coarse - grained theory for describing the solvent behavior in which solvent is accounted for by introducing a discrete state variable specifying whether the pocket is `` dry '' or `` wet . '' in this way , diffusive motion along the ( heavy body ) assembly coordinate is coupled to transitions between the wet and dry surfaces .",
    "this model is found to yield an improved description of the assembly process when compared with models that ignore these state changes and obey standard smoluchowski ( brownian ) dynamics . in this way",
    ", the leading phenomena that give rise to non - markovian behavior may be subsumed into a markovian master equation description that lies in a larger state space .",
    "here we have explored the role of solvent in the kinetics of ligand - pocket association .",
    "although our model is rather crude , it is still able to capture the displacement of water molecules by a ligand via hydrophobic drying transitions and the free energy barrier associated with ligand desolvation .",
    "however the ligand pocket is rather smooth and interactions are only mediated through the lennard - jones potential and not specific hydrogen bonding .",
    "indeed , the presence of water may be more or less favorable near hetergeneous surfaces@xcite or in different regions of the pocket  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pocket and the ligand are both rigid structures in the simulations and the coupling of ligand and pocket internal degrees of freedom is not presently considered .",
    "such effects may be rather slow and essential in the pathway to assembly , and may be incorporated in modified diffusive surface hopping models .",
    "assembly processes that occur in a bath of lighter particles are important in a wide variety of settings .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations provide an excellent tool for the study of such systems , although a deep understanding can be gained from the relation of large scale simulations to more coarse grained models of diffusion on smaller subsets of collective variables .",
    "this understanding can further clarify the kinetics of assembly processes and be incorporated into coarse - grained models .",

    "one performs series of umbrella sampling simulations along the reaction coordinate and extracts the friction from the time correlation function of reaction coordinate position at a given separation : @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the fluctuations of the reaction coordinate .    in our current study ,",
    "the umbrella sampling technique is utilized instead of the force - force autocorrelation technique @xcite that we previously employed  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the symmetries of the two - body friction tensor that are exploited in the work of ref .",
    "are not present when the two bodies are not identical as in the pocket - ligand complex .",
    "the protocol for the friction calculation is as follows .",
    "the force constant of the umbrella potential was chosen such that it was the lowest value that engenders a gaussian distribution about the average value of the reaction coordinate .",
    "the typical values of the force constant for the umbrella potential ranged between @xmath74 kj / mol / nm@xmath75 . at the ligand - pocket separation corresponding to the friction peak",
    ", we also repeated the calculation of the friction coefficient using different force constants .",
    "the uncertainties in the friction coefficient computed using different force constants was less than 10% of the average values .",
    "the following protocol was employed in order to compute position time correlation function to good statistical accuracy : at selected ligand - pocket separations , the system is first subjected to a short umbrella - sampling equilibration in the canonical ( nvt ) ensemble .",
    "subsequently , microcanonical ( nve ) umbrella sampling production runs were initiated by varying the initial velocity seeds . in the dewetting region , where very slow solvent fluctuations are present , twenty independent runs of up to 8 ns were carried out . outside this region , it was found that ten , 4 ns long trajectories are sufficient to converge the results .",
    "the values of instantaneous reaction coordinates were collected every 0.01 ps from each run . to facilitate energy conservation , double precision routines and a smaller time step of 0.001",
    "ps was utilized . due to the expensive nature of the computation ,",
    "the friction coefficient was computed at selected values of reaction coordinate .",
    "an estimate of the error in friction coefficient was also obtained by block averaging over multiple umbrella sampled trajectories for largest ligand - pocket separations as well as the ligand - pocket separation corresponding to friction peak .",
    "the uncertainty in the friction coefficient was 1 - 3@xmath76 of the average values for the highly attractive and intermediate attractive cases and 1 - 15@xmath76 of the average values for the weakly attractive cases .    for the purpose of analysis , the variation of pocket - water and ligand - water as a function of distance",
    "are also computed .",
    "the ` ligand - water ' is defined as the water in the first solvation shell ( @xmath77 nm ) of the ligand , and the ` pocket water ' is simply the number of water molecules present in the pocket pocket ( see fig [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations and relaxation time of the pocket waters are computed at different ligand - pocket separations .",
    "the solvent fluctuations are given by the expression @xmath78 and the relaxation time by , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of water molecules in the pocket and @xmath81 . in our previous work , such properties have been found to yield trends relatable to those observed for the profile of the friction coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic profiles and the corresponding water - profile for the intermediate attractive pocket ( @xmath69=0.008 kj / mol ) have been discussed in the main text . in this appendix",
    ", we will primarily discuss the results for the two remaining cases , namely the highly and weakly attractive pocket . in figs .",
    "[ fig : layout_weakly ] and [ fig : layout_attract ] , we present pocket - water , ligand - water , the potential of mean force and variation of the frictional coefficient with separation for the ligand interacting with the weakly and highly attractive pockets , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that , even when the ligand is far away from the pocket ( for large values of @xmath1 ) , different water densities are present in all three pockets presently considered ( see the main text for the pocket of intermediate attraction ) , owing to differences in the pocket hydration affinity .",
    "naturally , as the c60 potential is not modified , the number of waters in the ligand solvation shell is the same at large @xmath1 .",
    "as the ligand approaches the pocket , water is stripped from its solvation shell , and as it is rather hydrophilic , one can expect a contribution to the barrier to assembly arising from this process .",
    "there is an observed maximum in the number of pocket water as the ligand approaches the cavity , owing to the overlap of ligand solvation shell into the pocket .    when the ligand starts to enter the pocket ( @xmath82 nm ) , the weakly attractive pocket undergoes a drying transition",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layout_weakly]b ) . as in the case of intermediate attraction discussed in the main text ,",
    "high friction coefficients and large and slow solvent fluctuations are associated with the drying transition , albeit at a larger pocket - ligand separation .",
    "the solvent - induced free energy profile includes a relatively shallow basin at @xmath83 nm and a barrier that is primarily engendered by the desolvation of the ligand .",
    "hydrophobic attractive forces dominate and drive the ligand pocket complex to assembly , but there is an unexpected turnover of the free energy profile at very small pocket - ligand separations near the binding pose .",
    "we attribute this increase in the pmf for @xmath84 to the retention of water brought in by the hydrophilic ligand , which is unfavorable in this hydrophobic pocket ( see fig [ fig : layout_weakly]d ) .",
    "we also note that even though most of these features in the solvent - induced free energy profiles are also observed in the case of the pocket with intermediate attractions , the above - mentioned increase in free energy near the binding position is absent .        in the highly attractive pocket ( fig .",
    "[ fig : layout_attract ] ) , solvation water is stabilized by the relatively strong affinity of water for the cavity , even as the model ligand penetrates deeply into the pocket .",
    "peaks in the friction correspond to features in the potential of mean force for @xmath85 nm , as well as to large solvent fluctuations and relaxation times .",
    "the molecular - scale hydrodynamic effects are a manifestation of slow , confined water molecules which are `` squeezed out '' as the ligand is brought closer to the cavity wall . the highly attractive pocket expels water layer - by - layer as indicated by the decreases in number at @xmath86 nm and @xmath87 .",
    "the difference in these separations is dictated by the diameter of the water molecule ( @xmath88 nm ) .",
    "as shown in our previous work  @xcite , the peaks in the friction can fortify the kinetic barriers to association that the ligand experiences as it traverses the free energy surface .",
    "we propose a two dimensional model where one coordinate is the diffusive coordinate @xmath1 ( the separation between receptor and ligand ) , and the other is a discrete state variable @xmath24 , indicating whether the binding pocket is wet or dry . as shown in the eq . 2 in the main text ,",
    "this model has state dependent diffusion constants @xmath25 , evolves on state dependent free energy surfaces @xmath26 , and its state can change from wet to dry and from dry to wet by first order kinetics with rate constants also depending on @xmath1 .",
    "this model is equivalent to a particle diffusing on a potential energy surface that can hop between two functional forms , one for the wet and one for dry states , with different spatially dependent diffusion constants on each surface .",
    "we call this the diffusive surface hopping model ( dshm ) .",
    "the diffusion dynamics is thus coupled to transitions between the surfaces specified with rate constants @xmath89 .    in our present model , 22",
    "( 9 dry and 13 wet ) states are employed with a grid spacing of @xmath90 nm to describe the system on the domain of @xmath91 . for the purpose of this model ,",
    "a state is defined as dry if there are fewer than 15 water molecules in the pocket , and wet otherwise .",
    "the mean force is extracted from simulations where the ligand and pocket are fixed , and averages are taken separately over wet and dry states . the potentials of mean force corresponding to the wet and dry states are plotted in fig . 3 in the main text .",
    "these surfaces include the direct interactions of the heavy bodies , which are strictly attractive on the domain of @xmath1 that is currently considered .",
    "it can be seen that there is a relatively shallow minimum at @xmath92 nm .",
    "the dry surface is strictly attractive and assembly proceeds readily after a transition to a dry state occurs .",
    "transitions between the wet and dry surfaces are allowed in the region @xmath93 .",
    "the values of the transition rate constant at allowed values of @xmath1 are given in table 2 in the main text .",
    "matrix elements for transitions , @xmath40 , are estimated from the average dwell time in the dry state from md simulations at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the transition times become shorter as the bodies approach each other and fewer water molecules are displaced by the drying event . in general , the dry state becomes more favorable at smaller separations . at @xmath94 nm and @xmath95 nm",
    ", the transition rate parameters are estimated from the relaxation time of the solvent to irreversibly go from the wet to dry state , as wet states are not observed at long times .    in the drying region",
    ", the diffusion coefficient is approximated to be constant on each surface , albeit it is taken to be twice as large on the wet surface .",
    "this ratio is estimated from the position - position autocorrelation functions depicted in fig .",
    "3c of the main text .",
    "the value of the diffusion coefficient on the wet surface was taken to be equal to the diffusion coefficient at largest separations , @xmath96 . as the dshm only explicitly describes the wet to dry transitions , other hydrodynamic effects , such as the confined nature of pocket water",
    "are not included , and therefore this value may be considered an upper bound on an appropriate estimate for @xmath42 . outside the drying region ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is parameterized from the frictional profile ( see fig .",
    "2a in the main text ) .    an absorbing boundary is set at @xmath97 nm and a reflecting boundary is present at the wet state value of @xmath98 .",
    "the former denotes a position where assembly is considered to occur and the latter choice is justified by the fact no wet states are allowed at smaller separations due to steric hinderance as observed from the highly attractive case .",
    "in order to directly compare the dynamics of the diffusive surface hopping model to those of the explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation and one dimensional smoluchowski dynamics , we study the time - dependent spatial distribution and the mean first passage times ( mfpt ) for assembly . for this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out a separate set of md simulations , where the pocket is fixed and the ligand is free to move in the direction of @xmath1 . to guarantee that the ligand can not diffuse far away from the binding site , a repulsive wall potential is added to the system .",
    "this is achieved by means of the plumed plugin for gromacs  @xcite and ensures that all configurations are bound to the domain @xmath99 nm .",
    "the functional form of the boundary potential is as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 kj / mol / nm@xmath102 and l is the lower bound on @xmath1 which is set at @xmath103 nm ( a position slightly to the right of barrier in the total pmf ) . with this boundary in place",
    ", the kinetics of assembly upon ligand entry into the pocket is described , but not the diffusion of the ligand up to the pocket entry .",
    "a total of 645 different ligand - binding trajectories were run , either by varying the velocity seeds or by changing the solvent configurations at a fixed initial condition , @xmath104 .",
    "the initial configuration for each run is always chosen such that the occupation of pocket waters corresponds to a wet state .",
    "if a dry state is chosen then assembly proceeds rapidly .",
    "the markovian master equation is given by the following expression , @xmath105 and has the following formal solution , @xmath106 where the matrix @xmath107 is the propagator @xmath108 .",
    "this exponentiated matrix may be readily evaluated in the eigenbasis of @xmath50 , which may be computed by means of standard linear algebra libraries .",
    "given an absorbing state ( at @xmath109 ) , the survival probability may be computed from the sum over the probability of residing in non - absorbing states @xmath110 .",
    "the mean passage time is then obtained by taking the time integral of @xmath111 .    the survival probability of assembly from @xmath112 is plotted in fig . [ fig : survprob ] on a log scale for the md estimate as well as for the dshm and smoluchowski dynamics with and without hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) on the average surface .",
    "it can be seen that although the dshm exhibits reasonable agreement for the mfpt ( see table 2 of the main text ) , there are discrepancies at both short and long times . at short times , this is due to the fact that a larger fraction of md trajectories initially proceed in the direction of assembly ( @xmath113 ) than predicted by the dshm ( @xmath114 ) .    at longer times , the disagreement can be alleviated by using a different choice for the diffusion coefficient on the wet surface in the drying region , @xmath42 . as discussed above",
    ", the value chosen is that of the diffusion coefficient at large separations ( denoted as @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : survprob ] ) and can be considered an upper bound for this parameter .",
    "if @xmath42 is tuned so as to yield the same mfpt as the md estimate , then @xmath42 is found to be approximately @xmath116 .",
    "this result is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : survprob ] , and this alteration is shown to improve agreement with the md estimate at long times .",
    ", are increased for their baseline value , @xmath117 ( red circles with dashed line ) .",
    "for very fast transitions , the results converge to the avg - nohi result ( dashed black line ) , when the diffusion coefficient is taken to be @xmath42 on both surfaces.,width=268 ]    in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : survprob ] , we plot the survival probably on a log scale that correspond to the passage through the dewetting region and whose integral corresponds to the mfpt values given the two right - hand columns of table 2 in the main text .",
    "one can see how the avg - hi model is far more sensitive to the change in initial position than the other schemes .",
    "the dshm results exhibit some sensitivity to the choice of @xmath42 , although overall agreement with the md estimate is not greatly altered .",
    "as the transition rate between wet and dry states increases , the resultant behavior should converge onto the result obtained from the average surface .",
    "this behavior arises from the fact that the smoluchowski dynamics is recovered in the limit where the solvent dewetting fluctuations are fast .",
    "our model is indeed able to produce this effect as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : survfast ] . for the purpose of this result",
    ", we only consider a single diffusion constant on both the wet , dry , and average surfaces , @xmath118 .",
    "the initial distribution is again taken to be a wet state at @xmath43 nm .",
    "it can be clearly seen that , given the chosen parameters , as the transition rates are increased , the avg - nohi result is recovered from the dshm model .",
