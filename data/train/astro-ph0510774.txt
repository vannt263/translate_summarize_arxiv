    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) @xcite provides deep multi - wavelength observations in the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) and chandra deep field - south ( cdfs ) .",
    "the fields have been imaged by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in four bands ( f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp ) . at infrared wavelengths , observations by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ use the irac ( 3.6 - 8@xmath1 m ) and mips ( 24@xmath1 m ) instruments .",
    "the deepest x - ray surveys currently available have been made in the goods fields , using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton_. the goods fields are also targets of many ground - based studies using 4- and 8-meter class telescopes , providing imaging and spectroscopic data in optical and near - infrared bands .",
    "the richness and depth of data implies that goods will be a foundation for the study of galaxy formation and evolution over the next few years .",
    "space and ground - based observations and data acquired up to 2004 are described by @xcite .",
    "the available spectroscopic redshifts for these fields , combined with the multi - waveband imaging dataset , have been used to calibrate and determine photometric redshifts of many sources to faint magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deep radio observations of goods represent an excellent opportunity to explore a number of unresolved questions regarding radio emission from galaxies , since goods sources have a plethora of multiwavelength data available for their characterization . additionally , radio data on goods sources can , in some situations , resolve uncertainties and/or provide unique insights about the astrophysical processes at play .",
    "it is believed that the decimetric radio emission from galaxies is dominated by the synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated either by shock waves associated with supernovae ( and hence star formation , sf ) , by processes energized by a massive nuclear object ( an active galactic nucleus , agn ) , or by a combination of the two @xcite .",
    "radio emission associated with agns is responsible for the great majority of decimetric sources brighter than about @xmath2mjy .",
    "the optical hosts of these sources include massive elliptical galaxies , qsos and seyfert galaxies .",
    "radio selection of sources brighter than a few mjy preferentially selects for `` radio - loud '' agns having relatively high radio - to - optical luminosity ratios .",
    "agns also exist in the sub - mjy population : some are distant radio - loud sources , and others are intrinsically low - luminosity radio sources hosted by objects similar to those hosting radio - loud agns",
    ". observations of the radio emission from agns provide information about the existence and properties of central black holes , especially when combined with observations of x - ray power ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as clues to some properties of the interstellar and intergalactic medium .    among samples of radio sources selected at ever - fainter sub - mjy flux densities",
    ", the proportion of agns systematically declines in favor of sources energized by star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optical hosts of these starforming radio sources include blue galaxies with optical colors revealing a young stellar population , and extremely red galaxies with evidence for a very high degree of dust extinction .",
    "high resolution optical imaging often reveals disturbed morphologies indicative of interactions and/or merging activity among the sub - mjy radio population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is a tight correlation between the decimetric radio luminosity and the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of starforming galaxies . in such sources the fir emission",
    "is believed to be thermal emission from dust heated by stellar uv and optical emission .",
    "when the extinction is so high that almost all of the stellar luminosity is absorbed by dust , the fir luminosity measures the total uv / optical power and hence ( if the initial mass function is known ) the rate of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation between fir and radio luminosity allows the use of radio power observations to determine star - formation rates for galaxies that are too faint to be detected as fir sources .",
    "importantly , decimetric radio emission is free of extinction .",
    "deep decimetric observations of goods fields thus offer astrophysically useful data on black hole properties , star - formation processes , properties of the interstellar and intergalactic medium , and the relative densities and evolution of some major galaxy populations .",
    "accordingly , this paper commences the investigation of radio sources in the goods cdfs field , in particular the hst - acs region which has homogeneous optical , radio and x - ray coverage . to assist building a resource for the entire community , optical and x - ray identifications of the sources revealed in the recent atca 1.4ghz radio observations ( koekemoer et al .",

    "the catalogs presented in @xcite were also inspected for x - ray detections not reported in @xcite : the different data reduction and source detection methods result in a few faint sources being detected in only one of these works , which is nevertheless still relevant for the current study . however",
    ", this imposes some non - uniformity for the reported x - ray characteristics .",
    "while the catalogs produced by @xcite provide counts and fluxes in various bands covering the 0.58.0kev interval , and effective photon index is calculated for a power - law model with the galactic column density , taking into account the acis quantum efficiency degradation . ]",

    "still , the different reduction techniques and assumptions ( considering or not the acis degradation , for example ) between these x - ray catalogs should be noted .",
    "optical counterparts of radio sources in the goods acs field were identified using the likelihood ratio method of @xcite . for each radio source , the optical identification with the highest reliability ( @xmath26 ) , if above 20% , was taken as the real optical counterpart - if several optical identifications have similar values for @xmath26 , the various possibilities are considered .",
    "identifications were inspected visually to check for special situations where the likelihood ratio method would not apply , as in the case of non - independent sources ( either in the radio or in the optical ) .",
    "the identification of the x - ray counterparts was performed by searching the 3@xmath7 radio position error region .",
    "visual inspection was used to associate the optical and x - ray identifications .",
    "a few sources require special mention .",
    "source # 13 ( atcdfs_j033213.28 ) coincides with two optical sources in the acs @xmath17 image , although the goods catalog shows a single identification .",

    "source # 19 ( atcdfs_j033218.62 ) and source # 21 ( atcdfs_j033219.62 ) are 12  apart and display similar radio fluxes ( 4.8mjy and 5.9mjy , respectively ) .",
    "they are regarded as being the two radio lobes of the same radio galaxy , optically identified with a cd - type galaxy located roughly halfway between the two .",
    "source # 55 ( atcdfs_j033244.16 ) is identified with an extended interacting pair of galaxies , their optical positions lying just outside and beside the radio position error ellipse .",
    "this system is considered as the optical counterpart of the radio emission .",
    "table  [ tab : ids ] presents the final source identifications .",
    "the columns display :    \\(1 ) source number ;    \\(2 ) radio source name ;    \\(3 ) 1.4ghz flux density and associated error ;    \\(4 ) acs identification ;    \\(5 ) reliability ( @xmath26 ) of the acs identification ;    \\(6 ) distance in arcsec between the radio and the acs positions ;    \\(7 ) acs @xmath17 ( ab ) magnitude ;    \\(8 ) chandra x - ray observatory identification ;    \\(9 ) distance in arcsec between the radio and the cxo positions ;    \\(10 ) x - ray flux in the 0.5 - 2kev band ;    \\(11 ) x - ray flux in the 2 - 8kev band ;    radio sources with no optical counterpart show the @xmath17 3@xmath7 upper limit , estimated from the pixel rms ( 0.0008 - 0.0015countss@xmath4pixel@xmath4 ) , integrated over a @xmath27  aperture ( @xmath28 acs pixel box ) . the reliability calculation for optical identifications assumes each optical detection individually .",
    "whenever a merger or interacting pair of galaxies is identified as the optical counterpart , and one of the sources clearly dominates @xmath26 , we present in table  [ tab : ids ] only the highest value of @xmath26 , noting that this will be a lower limit for the true reliability of the optical system .",
    "sources with an x - ray identification from @xcite are identified by their reported source number in that work .",
    "of the 64 radio sources in the goods acs cdfs region , two are considered to be radio lobes of the same radio galaxy . for most of the sample",
    ", a reliable unique optical counterpart is found , but eight of the radio sources have several possible optical counterparts : five of these ( sources # 13 , # 47 , # 48 , # 51 and # 55 ) arise from likely interacting pairs , for which we present in table  [ tab : ids ] data for both members , while the remaining three ( sources # 41 , # 52 and # 60 ) are ambiguous identifications , each with two seemingly independent likely optical counterparts .",
    "the x - ray detection for sources # 41 and # 52 suggests which optical counterpart is the real one .",
    "seven ( 11% ) radio sources have no optical counterpart .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we estimate the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio from the relation    @xmath29    where the x - ray flux is measured in erg@xmath23s@xmath4 in the 0.5 - 2kev band .",
    "this expression results from the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio definition of @xcite , that involved 0.3 - 3.5kev flux and @xmath30-band optical magnitude .",
    "these quantities were converted to 0.5 - 2kev flux and @xmath17 magnitude assuming a power - law x - ray spectral energy distribution with @xmath31 and a @xmath32 color of 1.2mag , which are the averages for galaxies in the current sample with detections in these bands . assuming this expression , agns will _ typically _ display x - ray - to - optical flux ratios above @xmath33 , while star - forming galaxies _ tend _ to display lower values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we also define a radio - to - optical flux ratio as    @xmath34    where we use the measured radio flux density at 1.4ghz in mjy . although this is not an agn / star - formation discriminator , since high radio - to - optical fluxes can be seen in both radio - powerful agn or dust - rich galaxies , it is still useful to identify extreme sources in the sample .",
    "the cdfs is being intensively studied by several groups . in particular ,",
    "spectroscopic observations of the optical counterparts of many x - ray sources have been made .",
    "the counterparts of the faint radio sources in the goods acs cdfs field presented here were thus searched for the availability of spectroscopic redshifts from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first reports spectroscopic observations of possible optical counterparts of x - ray sources in the cdfs , down to @xmath35mag , using the vlt with the fors1/fors2 spectrographs .",
    "@xcite describe the results of the vimos vlt deep survey around the cdfs , which includes 784 redshifts in the acs area , down to @xmath36mag .",
    "@xcite present the vlt - fors2 spectroscopic observations of sources in the goods - s acs region .",
    "source selection in that investigation was optimized to detect high redshift objects , in order to take advantage of the characteristics of fors2 ( high throughput and spectral resolution , and reduced fringing at red wavelengths ) , mostly down to @xmath37mag .",
    "finally , @xcite deals with the vlt - fors1/fors2 spectroscopic observations of @xmath38-selected galaxies from the k20 survey , which includes a 32.2 arcmin@xmath39 field within the cdfs .",
    "several investigations for photometric redshifts in the cdfs region have been made in the past .",
    "particularly relevant is the study by the combo-17 project , which has observed this region with the _ wide field imager _ ( wfi ) at the eso 2.2-m telescope with a 17-band filter set covering the @xmath40 nm wavelength range .",
    "as explained by @xcite , this `` very - low resolution spectra '' allows accurate photometric redshifts to be obtained down to @xmath41mag . seeing - adaptive ,",
    "weighted aperture photometry is used , to measure the same fraction of an object in every band independently of seeing effects - for most objects this is similar to a flux measurement in an aperture of 1.5  diameter in 1.5  seeing @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution templates used include star , galaxy ( with and without extinction ) and qso types .",
    "mean redshift and variance ( 1@xmath7 ) as well as the classification from the best fit procedure were extracted from the catalog @xcite and presented here .    for optically fainter sources , eventually at higher redshifts",
    ", the near - infrared bands not covered by the combo-17 dataset assume a more important role . to get a photometric redshift estimate for these objects ,",
    "we have also searched the catalog of @xcite , which uses ground - based optical ( @xmath42-bands ) and near - infrared ( @xmath43 ) data from eso facilities ( wfi at the 2.2-m telescope , fors1 and isaac at the vlt , sofi at the ntt ) as well as space observations from @xmath44/acs ( @xmath45 ) , resulting in as many as 18 independent photometric measurements for each source . while useful for fainter sources , the spectral libraries used do not include qso templates , which results in lack of accuracy for some sources , as can be seen in this paper .",
    "also , the photometry measurements in @xcite were made through matched 3  diameter apertures in all bands . in the case of some optical sources with very - close neighbors ,",
    "often only identified in the acs images , this can bias the photometric redshift estimate : we note such cases when commenting on the individual sources .",
    "luminosities were estimated whenever a redshift determination exists . in order of reliability",
    ", we have considered the spectroscopic redshift or , in its absence , the photometric redshift from the combo-17 work . for faint sources with no other redshift information ,",
    "the estimate from @xcite was used .",
    "the rest - frame x - ray luminosity was calculated as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the luminosity distance ( cm ) , @xmath48 is the x - ray flux in the 0.5 - 8kev band ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath25 is the photon index , taken from @xcite . for sources detected only in the @xcite catalogs , the 0.5 - 8kev x - ray flux is taken as the sum of the 0.5 - 2kev and the 2 - 8kev fluxes , where the latter is derived from the quoted 2 - 10kev flux assuming @xmath31 , as explained above .",

    "we adopt a classification based primarily on the observed x - ray properties @xmath54 and hardness ratio ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "@xmath54 is derived from the 0.58kev fluxes and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts , while @xmath55 is calculated as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being , respectively , the count rates in the hard ( 28kev ) and soft ( 0.52kev ) bands taken from @xcite . for sources detected in x - rays only in the @xcite catalogs , we assume the quoted hardness ratio derived from the 0.52kev and 210kev band counts , neglecting the ( small ) discrepancy arising from the different hard band used .",
    "our classification rests on the criteria adopted by @xcite , namely :    galaxy : @xmath59ergs@xmath4 and @xmath60 ;    agn-2 : @xmath61ergs@xmath4 and @xmath62 ;    agn-1 : @xmath63ergs@xmath4 and @xmath60 ;    qso-2 : @xmath64ergs@xmath4 and @xmath62 ;    qso-1 : @xmath64ergs@xmath4 and @xmath60 .    in view of the different x - ray catalog employed here , the different bands used to calculate @xmath54 ( 0.58kev instead of 0.510kev ) and the different k - corrections employed in the calculation of @xmath54 we note that there are some ( expected ) differences between the x - ray classification presented in @xcite and the one herein for some galaxies that appear in both works .    among sources with insufficient x - ray information ( or no x - ray detection ) ,",
    "an agn identification was assigned whenever @xmath65ergs@xmath4 ( source classified as agnx ) or @xmath66whz@xmath4 ( source classified as agnr ) , as derived from the spectroscopic redshift or the most likely photometric redshift estimate .",
    "the adopted radio luminosity limit is derived from the radio luminosity distribution for star - forming galaxies and agns observed in the phoenix deep survey @xcite .",
    "also the optical spectroscopic information , where available , was used . since most sources with a spectrum",
