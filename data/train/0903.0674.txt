    "in fact , there is growing evidence for _ coexistence _ of static magnetism and superconductivity extending into the superconducting region of the feas based superconductors .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath6sr ) experiments  @xcite in both electron and hole - doped pnictides have revealed substantial magnetism in the superconducting state .",
    "a recent report on neutron diffraction in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 showed that magnetism and superconductivity may coexist even up to 40% of k doping  @xcite . in order to understand the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in the feas superconductors it is of central importance to determine if it is magnetic order or magnetic disorder that competes with superconductivity ; whether the magnetism is local or exists in a separate phase , or is possibly isolated in various regions of the sample .",
    "this is the main thrust of our work where we use nmr as a microscopic probe of magnetic impurities .",
    "it is well established  @xcite that @xmath7-wave superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic disorder where quasiparticle scattering from magnetic impurities is an effective pair breaking process , often called spin - flip scattering .",
    "in contrast , both potential and magnetic scattering in non-@xmath7-wave superconductors are effective at breaking cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the study of the robustness of the superconducting state in the presence of magnetic impurities , compared to non - magnetic impurities , can be taken as one indication for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "additionally , impurities can play a key role in the pinning of flux which may be essential in achieving high critical current densities in some applications .",
    "we have investigated the effect of magnetic impurities in the normal state of crystals of the superconducting compound ba@xmath8k@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , which we will refer to henceforth simply as bak122 , using @xmath10as nmr ( gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath11 mhz / t ( used as the reference for calculating the knight shift in this work ) ; spin , @xmath12 ; and natural abundance , 100% ) .",

    "in contrast the ca122 crystals have negligible amounts of sn in the structure  @xcite .",
    "the potassium doped crystals become superconducting with a transition temperature of @xmath14 k. by comparison with the pure compound  @xcite with the same doping we can infer that the @xmath15 suppression is @xmath16 k. the principal question we address is how uniformly distributed are these impurities and are they coupled to the conduction electrons .",
    "we have found that they are strongly magnetic ; that they are locally distributed on a microscopic scale ; and that they appear to be closely coupled to the conduction electrons .",
    "it is unusual that a compound remains superconducting in the presence of such significant amounts of magnetism .",

    "chemical substitution in the 122 family has a different role as compared with the cuprates in that superconductivity only appears by inhibiting the structural transition as can be achieved by insertion of co into ba122  @xcite , sr122  @xcite , and ni into ba122  @xcite . however , the nature and effect of impurity scattering on the superconducting state in the pnictides is not yet well - established .",

    "a @xmath6sr measurement  @xcite on feas , and feas@xmath2 seems to rule out the possibility of these two impurity phases as being responsible for the observed magnetism . in this paper , we report normal - state nmr measurements on crystals containing @xmath22% sn impurity of superconducting ba@xmath8k@xmath9fe@xmath2as@xmath2 and non - superconducting bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",

    "nmr measurements give both static and dynamic information about the local magnetic field and the electric field gradient distributions associated with impurities .",
    "the nmr spectrum can be shifted by local magnetic fields from an impurity magnetic moment , either through direct interactions via dipole - dipole coupling between local moments and the nucleus , or through indirect interactions involving hyperfine coupling to conduction electrons ( indirect exchange ) or orbital electrons ( super exchange ) .",
    "the indirect interaction has an oscillatory character ( see the review by alloul  @xcite for example ) , which for dilute concentrations of impurities can be recognized from the magnitude of the effective field that they generate , defined later in this paper . since the impurity effects associated with the indirect interaction are largely spatially inhomogeneous and are averaged over an effective field that is oscillatory , one typically finds significantly reduced paramagnetic shifts in the average local field displayed in the knight shift  @xcite . on the other hand the distribution of these shifts given by the nmr linewidth can be substantial .",
    "it is also well established that paramagnetic fluctuations from impurities can `` wipe - out '' contributions to the nmr from nearby spectator nuclei owing to short spin - spin relaxation and/or short spin - lattice relaxation times .",

    "we have explored evolution of the spectra as a function of both temperature and magnetic field ( a representative plot of the temperature evolution of the spectra at 62.21 mhz is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) from which we conclude that the nmr line broadening is a result of static magnetic field distributions that become progressively more severe at lower temperatures , rendering the nmr line unobservable in the superconducting state .",
    "this is evident in fig  [ fig3 ] , which shows the variation of the linewidth ( fwhm ) , and the total nuclear magnetization ( proportional to the number of resonating nuclei , given by the area of the spectrum ) as a function of temperature at 62.21 mhz .",
    "the total nuclear magnetization deviates from the nuclear - curie law below 80 k indicating that there is additional line broadening too large for us to fully observe the resonance .",

[ fig4 ] ) , indicates that the linewidth is predominantly of magnetic origin .",
    "[ fig4 ] also shows the dependence on magnetic field of the linewidth of the broad and narrow components of the spectra for ba122 .",
    "the field dependence of the linewidth of the broad component is similar to that of bak122 , _ i.e. _ proportional to the magnetic field indicating that the origin of the line broadening is the same for both samples , and in particular for bak122 , this magnetic inhomogeneity coexists with the superconducting state since the nmr line remains too broad to observe below @xmath15 .    as linewidth for bak122 and ba122 at 100 k. for ba122",

    "[ fig4 ] passes through zero indicates that the quadrupolar contribution to the linewidth is negligible compared to the effect of magnetic impurities .",
    "in contrast , self - flux grown ba122 crystals have a narrow nmr spectrum  @xcite and an absence of paramagnetic impurities . based on the results in fig .  4 for bak122 , we expect that @xmath33 should be proportional to the bulk magnetization  @xcite , @xmath34 , @xmath35    as fig .",

    "@xmath41 is the shift due to magnetic impurities , and can be written as , @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the effective magnetic field at the as nucleus .",
    "the data from all of our measurements have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in the form @xmath48 versus @xmath40 . from the linear fit to the total knight shift at 6.4 t and 62.21 mhz we find @xmath49 to be 0.37% , somewhat larger than for the undoped compound  @xcite , 0.3% .",
    "the effective field we obtain from our fit is 5.3(1 ) koe/@xmath50 .",
    "if the magnetization from impurities were uniformly distributed then the effective field arising from direct dipole coupling of the impurity moment to the @xmath10as nuclei , based on @xmath51 , would be 0.6 koe/@xmath50 , an order of magnitude smaller than what we observe for the nmr shift shown in fig .",
    "consequently , the effective field must be enhanced by hyperfine coupling and leads us to the conclusion that the as nuclei are indirectly coupled to the magnetic impurities through the conduction electrons .",
    "we can not independently identify the magnetic contribution to depairing and determine its role in the suppression of @xmath15 .",
    "however , we note that the resistivity in the normal state just above @xmath15 for bak122 with @xmath13% sn impurity  @xcite is larger than for the pure compound  @xcite by @xmath52 m@xmath53-cm , almost a factor of three ; an impurity effect which is significantly larger than for 1% zn substituted for cu in ybco@xmath54  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the scattering mechanism for sn in bak122 might likely be identified with its comparatively larger magnetization and therefore be principally magnetic .",
    "so then it is puzzling why the transition temperature in bak122 is only suppressed by @xmath55% .",
    "one possible explanation might be that the magnetic impurity distribution , although very broad , might be strongly correlated , which is to say that there are regions with fewer impurities on the coherence length scale that dominate the overall transition temperature via the proximity effect .",
    "this phenomenon is well established  @xcite for impurities in superfluid @xmath17he where it is shown that the transition temperature is suppressed much less than the amplitude of the order parameter for a wide range in the strength of pair breaking .        also in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the linewidth from the paramagnetically broadened nmr spectra as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "the effect of impurities is to produce a strongly inhomogeneous field distribution throughout the sample .",
    "in fact , as a point of comparison , consider the extreme model of a very inhomogeneous field distribution taken to be constant , up to a cutoff . in this case",
    "the width of the distribution would be exactly half of the average .",
    "this situation is rather similar to our spectra for bak122 , as shown in fig .  5 , where the linewidth is twice the knight shift .",
    "from this perspective it is evident that the magnetic field distribution is indeed very broad .",
    "nonetheless , the absence of a narrow component in the spectrum indicates that the field distribution persists to the nanometer scale , typical of magnetic interactions with the nuclear spin .",
    "all of our nmr experiments are based on the formation of a spin echo after two pulses , mostly involving the fourier transform ( fft ) of the echo .",
    "ideally the pulses are a @xmath56 echo sequence ( hahn echo ) . during the time @xmath57 ,",
    "development of spin decoherence reduces the echo amplitude and , in principle , can alter the shape of the fft spectrum .",
    "decoherence is determined by spin - spin relaxation for which an example is shown in fig .",
    "we compare the relaxation profiles for the crystals of bak122 and ca122 , above the temperature for the structural transition for the latter .",
    "additionally we show the echo amplitude evolution in bak122 using the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) sequence @xmath58echo@xmath59 where the indices @xmath60 label rf pulses with orthogonal phases ( see for example , ref .",
    "35 ) .    for a static , homogeneous , environment of the nuclear spin",
    "its spin - spin relaxation time , @xmath61 , should be less than that determined by the nuclear dipole - dipole coupling . from the crystal structure",
    "we calculate that @xmath61 from this coupling is 0.72 ms for bak122 , and 0.59 ms for ca122 , which has negligible impurities .",
    "the calculated @xmath61 is close to what we observe in the case of the ca122 crystal .",
    "however , for bak122 the recovery profile gives a larger @xmath61 than expected by @xmath62 2.5 , for small @xmath57 values .",
    "this result indicates that there is quenching of the dipole - dipole interaction for bak122 , presumably from magnetic field gradients producing local field differences greater than the dipolar field of the near - neighbor as atoms .",
    "we were then led to explore if these field gradients were dynamic by application of a cpmg sequence that can reduce or eliminate their stochastic effect  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cpmg recovery profile develops even less rapidly than that for the hahn echo suggestive of the existence of these field fluctuations .",
    "theoretical analysis  @xcite of the hahn echo profile gives the fit shown in fig .",
    "6 for a characteristic field fluctuation frequency ( @xmath63 ) of just 2.2 khz .",
    "although the fit is excellent , we should be careful about this interpretation since there is not a well - defined @xmath64pulse .",
    "the rf - pulses are rather inhomogeneous over the sample and , secondly , the nmr line for bak122 is very broad , meaning that much of the received signal is off - resonance . in this regard",
    "we note that the cpmg experiment on ca122 , for which the crystal has a similar geometry and consequently the same inhomogeneous rf - field , has a cpmg recovery profile which is the same as for the hahn echo .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation for a pure compound in the absence of field fluctuations .",
    "a similar effect was observed in @xmath65pt nmr in nanometer size unsupported pt particles  @xcite . there",
    "the hahn - echo @xmath61 of the pt nuclei on the particle surface , is much shorter than the cpmg @xmath61 , which can be accounted for by an inhomogeneous magnetic field with field fluctuations arising from spin - diffusion .",
    "if the local fields are indeed fluctuating in bak122 , in the khz range , this is so low in frequency that it suggests that the magnetism is a collective phenomenon , possibly super - paramagnetic , rather than being associated with independent fluctuations of local moments .",
    "most importantly however , is that we have found an unusually long @xmath61 which is a an indication of large local magnetic field gradients in bak122 .",
    "we have also compared spin - lattice relaxation in bak122 and in ca122 . for the former we find",
    "@xmath26 at 100 k @xmath27 ms , in comparison with 7.6 ms at 190 k for ca122 . the @xmath26 for bak122 is comparable to the @xmath26 in ba122 reported in ref  30 at the same temperature . despite the existence of magnetic impurities in bak122 , its relatively long @xmath26 gives no indication for a contribution to spin - lattice relaxation from field fluctuations , possibly because their frequency is too low compared to the larmor frequency .",
    "lastly , it is essential in an nmr experiment , to check how much of the sample is contributing to the signal .",
    "it is meaningless to interpret nmr results if the vast majority of the sample , relevant in comparisons with other experiments , does not contribute to the nmr signal .",
    "we have made a direct estimate of the nmr active fraction of the samples comparing bak122 and ca122 and have found that the nmr signal strength is comparable , taking sample shape and size into account and using the same nmr conditions .",
    "consequently , we believe that the results we report are representative of the entire sample with the exception , as noted above , for data below 80 k in bak122 and ba122 .",
    "the magnetization from impurities in our bak122 crystals , grown from sn flux , is exceptionally large .",
    "in fact the magnetization is @xmath20 60 times larger than that of la@xmath66sr@xmath67cuo@xmath68 for which superconductivity is completely suppressed by al substitution . the large curie - weiss - like magnetization in bak122 results in a significant broadening and displacement of the @xmath10as nmr spectrum .",
    "since there is no narrow component we infer that the magnetic inhomogeneity persists to a microscopic scale .",
    "the local moments associated with these impurities appear to be coupled to the as nucleus by an indirect interaction through the conduction holes with an effective field h@xmath69 koe/@xmath50 .",
    "we suggest that the impurities are associated with sn substituted on the as site , broadly distributed .",
    "superconductivity in bak122 takes place in a backdrop of inhomogeneous magnetism associated with these impurities .",
    "the extent of pair breaking from magnetic impurity scattering can only be qualitatively linked to their paramagnetism , or possibly super - paramagnetism .",
    "nonetheless , our bak122 crystals are indeed superconducting and exhibit a relative suppression of the transition temperature of only 20% .",
    "we attribute the robustness of superconductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities to strong spatial correlations between the impurities , a non - uniformity that is also apparent in the large magnetic field distributions and field gradients which we observe directly with nmr .",

    "<S> there is a concomitant @xmath4% reduction in the transition temperature which is most likely due to magnetic electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the relative robustness of superconductivity ( @xmath5 ) in the presence of severe magnetic inhomogeneity might be accounted for by strong spatial correlations between impurities on the coherence length scale . </S>"
