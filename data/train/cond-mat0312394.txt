    "the phase diagram includes ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , paramagnetic ( pm ) , charge - ordered , metallic as well as insulating domains .",
    "the manganites crystallise in the perovskite like lattice structure , and quasi two - dimensional systems with well separated mno@xmath7-(bi)layers also exist .",
    "crystal field splitting divides the five d - orbitals of the mn ions into three energetically favoured @xmath9 and two @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "all three @xmath9 orbitals are singly occupied and rather localised .",
    "the filling of the @xmath10 orbitals is determined by doping and these electrons can hop from one mn ion to the next via the intermediate oxygen ( double exchange , de ) . due to a strong hund s rule coupling ,",
    "the spins of the three @xmath9 electrons are aligned in parallel and form a corespin with length @xmath11 .",
    "beinig localised , these electrons interact through superexchange which leads to a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the corespins .",
    "hund s rule coupling also leads to a ferromagnetic interaction between the itinerant @xmath10 electrons and the @xmath9 corespin .",
    "apart from double- and superexchange , a complete description would have to include coulomb repulsion between the @xmath10 electrons , lattice distortions and disorder .",
    "full quantum mechanical many - body calculations for a realistic model , including all degrees of freedom , are not yet possible , see however @xcite for a one - dimensional study . several approximate studies of simplified models have therefore been performed in order to unravel individual pieces of the rich phase diagram of the manganites .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are generally treated by a kondo lattice model  @xcite .    as full quantum mechanical results in more than one",
    "dimensions are difficult to obtain for the quantum mechanical kondo lattice model , it has been proposed to treat the s=3/2 corespins classically , see de gennes  @xcite , dagotto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and furukawa  @xcite unbiased monte carlo ( mc ) techniques can then be applied .",
    "coulomb repulsion  @xcite , classical phonons @xcite and disorder @xcite have also been treated within this classical approach .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been tested in  @xcite and it appears that quantum effects are important for ( s=1/2 ) corespins or at @xmath12 . for finite temperature and s=3/2 , classical spins present a reasonable approximation .",
    "further approximations can be made by taking into account , that the hund coupling @xmath13 is much stronger than the kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , configurations are very unlikely in which the electronic spin is antiparallel to the local corespin .",
    "a customary approach is to take @xmath14 .",
    "this approximation however breaks down for the almost completely filled lower kondo band . in the dilute hole regime ,",
    "the full kondo model is governed by an effective afm interaction between the corespins due to excitations into the upper kondo band .",
    "this effect is completely absent from the @xmath14 model .",
    "an effective spinless fermion ( esf ) model  @xcite has been proposed to improve upon this approximation . in this model ,",

    "many of these studies revealed features , e.  g. an infinite compressibility near the filled lower kondo band , which have been interpreted as signatures of ps .",

    "this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the model hamiltonian is presented and particularities of the mc simulation for the present model are outlined .",
    "a canonical algorithm is introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fmp ] , we introduce a simplified model of ferromagnetic polarons embedded in an afm background and present results for this model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical_results ] , these results are compared to unbiased monte carlo simulations of the 2d ferromagnetic kondo model with classical corespins at realistic parameter values .",
    "the key results of the paper are summarised in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we will concentrate solely on properties of the itinerant @xmath10 electrons interacting with the local @xmath9 corespins .",
    "we also neglect the degeneracy of the @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the @xmath10 electrons are then described by a single - orbital kondo lattice model  @xcite .",
    "as the corespins are approximated by classical spins , they are replaced by unit vectors @xmath17 , parameterised by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of both corespins and @xmath10-spins is absorbed into the exchange couplings .      by choosing the quantisation of the @xmath10 spin parallel to the local @xmath9 corespin , simplified low - energy models for fillings @xmath20",
    "( i.e. for the lower kondo band ) can be derived , namely the @xmath21 approximation and the effective spinless fermion model with finite @xmath13 ( see  @xcite ) : @xmath22 the spinless fermion operators  @xmath23 correspond to _ local _ spin - up electrons ( i.e. parallel to the corespin ) only .",
    "the spin index has therefore been omitted . with respect to a _ global _ spin - quantisation axis the esf model  ( [ eq : h ] ) still contains contributions from both spin - up and spin - down electrons .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) corresponds to the kinetic energy in tight - binding approximation .",
    "the modified hopping integrals @xmath24 depend upon the @xmath9 corespin orientation @xmath25 where the relative orientation of the @xmath9 corespins at site @xmath26 and @xmath27 , expressed by the angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 , enters via @xmath30 with the abbreviations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these factors depend on the relative angle @xmath33 of corespins @xmath17 and @xmath34 and on some complex phases @xmath35 and @xmath36 . because hopping is largest for parallel corespins , this term favours ferromagnetism . for certain spin structures ,",
    "an electron may obtain a different phase depending on the path taken from one lattice site to another .",
    "an example of such structures is the so called flux phase  @xcite .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) accounts for virtual hopping processes to antiparallel spin ",
    "corespin configurations and vanishes in the limit @xmath21 . for finite @xmath13 ,",
    "the esf model takes into account virtual hopping processes to antiparallel spin - corespin configurations much in the same way as the @xmath37-model includes virtual hopping to doubly occupied sites for the hubbard model . because this term is proportional to the density , it is most relevant near the completely filled lower kondo band , where the kinetic energy is moreover reduced .",
    "the last term is a small antiferromagnetic exchange of the corespins .",
    "the hopping strength @xmath38 will serve as our unit of energy .",
    "@xmath13 is usually taken to be of the order of magnitude of @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and @xmath41 of the order of @xmath42 .",

    "the cpu time then scales with the system size @xmath52 as @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 as for the full diagonalization and the algorithm can be easily parallelised .",
    "we found , however , that on single processors the full diagonalization can be accelerated to be faster than this approach up to system sizes of @xmath55 lattice sites , while both algorithms would be too slow for the study of larger systems on present day s processors .",
    "the key for a faster full diagonalization is to exploit the structure of the hamiltonian : the lattice sites are relabeled in order to obtain a band matrix with as few diagonals as possible .",
    "this is only an alternative assignment of the linear index to the two dimensional lattice vector and does therefore not introduce any approximation or error .",
    "fast library routines for band matrices can then be used .",
    "since the purpose of our mc code was to perform parameter studies , we did not program a parallel algorithm but instead ran the whole calculation on each cpu with a different parameter set . recently , an @xmath56 algorithm has been proposed by the same authors , which reduces the numerical effort by approximating the matrix - vector multiplication  @xcite .    in the 2d case we have employed mc updates in which single spins were rotated .",
    "the angle of rotation was optimised to keep the acceptance high enough . from time to time",
    "a complete flip @xmath57 was proposed .",
    "the skip between subsequent measurements was chosen to be 50 to a few hundreds of lattice sweeps reducing autocorrelations to a negligible level .",
    "we have performed mc runs with some hundreds to 2000 measurements on a @xmath58 lattice .",
    "this geometry was chosen to reduce finite size ( closed shell ) effects observed on a square lattice .",
    "the number of measurements was higher for calculations in the polaronic regime , where the particle number fluctuates strongly , in order to have sufficient measurements for each filling .",
    "as previously shown  @xcite , the spin - integrated one - particle green s function in global quantisation can be written as @xmath59\\;}w({{\\cal s}}|\\mu ) u_{ji}^{{\\uparrow}{\\uparrow}}({{\\cal s } } )      \\ll c{^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}_{i } ; c^\\dagger_{j } \\gg^{{\\cal s}}_\\omega\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the green s function in local spin quantisation .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the one - particle eigenvalues @xmath61 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath62 of the hamiltonian @xmath63 : @xmath64 it should be pointed out that the one - particle density of states ( dos ) is identical in global and local quantisation ; for details see  @xcite .      due to the jump in the electron density at the critical chemical potential ( shown later in fig .",
    "[ n_vs_mu_jh06j002beta50.eps ] ) , some electron fillings can not be examined with the grand canonical algorithm .",
    "we therefore developed a canonical scheme .",
    "canonical calculations were done by computing the eigenenergies for each corespin configuration and then filling the available electrons into the lowest levels  @xcite .",
    "this method does , however , not account for thermal particle - hole excitations around the fermi energy .",
    "when several one - particle states have similar energy , these may become important .",
    "it was also proposed to adjust the chemical potential by solving an implicit equation using the newton - raphson algorithm for every single spin configuration to give the wanted particle number  @xcite .",
    "while this approach includes particle hole excitations , it is still not certain , whether the calculation is correct and small differences possibly have a considerable effect when phases with and without a pseudogap compete .",
    "on the other hand , an exact approach would mean calculating the boltzmann weight for every possible distribution of @xmath65 particles on @xmath52 energy levels and summing over their contributions .",
    "even for small lattice sizes @xmath52 , this clearly becomes too demanding for more than a few electrons or holes .",
    "instead , we took into account just the lowest excitations of the fermi sea by filling @xmath66 electrons into the @xmath67 lowest states and considering only the distributions of the @xmath68 remaining electrons on the states around the fermi energy . usually , it is sufficient to take @xmath69 .",
    "the weight for the corespin configuration @xmath49 then depends on the particle number instead of the chemical potential : @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes these restricted permutations .",
    "although this is more time - consuming than the grand canonical calculation of the fermionic weight , the additional consumption of computer time is small compared to the time needed for the diagonalization of the one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "the particle - hole excitations , which are thus included , can be crucial when examining competition between phases with and without a pseudogap .    a mc update - especially a complete spin flip - may lead to a configuration which is very unlikely to occur at the given particle number , although it may be a good configuration for a different filling .",
    "a later mc move might then lead back to the original particle number , and these moves should improve autocorrelation .",
    "we therefore allow density fluctuations within a set of four to five particle numbers . in order to spend a comparable number of mc steps at each filling ,",
    "prior weight factors @xmath72 were introduced and adjusted in a prerun , giving @xmath73 the sum is taken over the set of allowed particle numbers @xmath74 and @xmath75 is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mc_weight_can ] ) .",
    "when evaluating observables for fixed electron number , one has to calculate the expectation value @xmath76 which can be rewritten as @xmath77 configurations @xmath49 occur in the markov chain with probability proportional to @xmath78 ; when the sum is taken over the configurations produced by the mc run , the expectation value therefore becomes @xmath79",
    "near half filling of a single @xmath10 band , a tendency toward phase separation has been reported in various computational studies  @xcite .    in most cases ,",
    "the existence of phase separation is inferred from a discontinuity of the electron density as a function of the chemical potential . at the critical chemical potential where this discontinuity is found ,",
    "it is claimed that the system separates into fm domains of high carrier concentration and afm domains of low carrier concentration .",
    "we have already shown that for a 1d system  @xcite this picture is in general incorrect .",
    "in fact , what happens is that each single hole is dressed by a ferromagnetic cloud in which it delocalizes .",
    "the system can be well described by free quasiparticles consisting of a single hole plus a local ( three to four - sites for 1d , 5 sites for 2d ) ferromagnetic well embedded in an af background .",
    "each of these added quasiparticles gains the same energy , which is exactly balanced by the energy to be paid for the critical chemical potential @xmath80 .",
    "hence the discontinuity of the particle number at low temperatures .",
    "+    here we show that ferromagnetic polarons , i.e.  _ single _ charge carriers surrounded by small ferromagnetic spin - clouds , are indeed formed when holes are doped into a completely filled lower kondo band in 2d . in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of idealised two dimensional model polarons , whereas in the next section we compare our polaron - model to unbiased monte carlo results .      as reference configuration",
    "we consider the completely filled lower kondo band where super exchange and the contribution from the virtual hopping process , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , give rise to an antiferromagnetic corespin pattern . the smallest defect in a completely antiferromagnetically ordered 2d",
    "lattice is the flipping of one single spin . then a five - site ferromagnetic region forms .",
    "when we introduce a hole into the system , it can delocalize in this region because of the double - exchange mechanism . as there is no double - exchange hopping between sites with perfectly antiferromagnetic spins",
    ", the hole is trapped inside the ferromagnetic region . in this simple model",
    ", the hole can hop from the central site of this region ( site 1 ) where the spin has been flipped , to all nearest neighbours ( sites 25 ) .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian describing this situation reads @xmath81 with the hopping between ferromagnetic sites @xmath82 in this model .",
    "since the hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to rotations by @xmath83 , the ground state should also show this property and can thus be found in the space spanned by @xmath84 , where the hamiltonian reads @xmath85 the delocalization energy of the hole is thus given by @xmath86 .",

    "they appear in the one - particle spectral function of the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ polaron_bands ] .    to create such a ferromagnetic domain , however , four antiferromagnetic bonds have to be broken .",
    "this costs the energy of @xmath94 .",
    "near the completely filled lower kondo band @xmath95 , the total antiferromagnetic exchange coupling is approximately given by @xmath96 , see  @xcite .",
    "the energy gained by adding one hole to the system thus reads @xmath97 when the chemical potential approaches @xmath98 from above , holes start to enter the system forming individual polarons .",
    "therefore , the critical chemical potential is given by @xmath99 .",
    "up to a certain concentration , these holes can be treated as free fermions which all have the same energy @xmath100 .",
    "the energy may , however , depend on the temperature if @xmath82 or @xmath101 do .",
    "the more obvious temperature effect is the smearing of the discontinuity in the electron filling at higher temperatures , which results from the application of the fermi - dirac statistics to these quasiparticles .",
    "+    it is interesting to compare the energy of two such independent holes to a larger fm formation containing two holes . the two possibilities with the least broken afm bonds are depicted in fig .  [ dbl_polaron ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : spec_jse0.02_beta50 ] shows the spectral density for the esf model with @xmath114 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath106 holes .",
    "in addition to the central band , the polaronic states can be seen at energies slightly below @xmath127 , in perfect agreement with the simple polaron model , see fig .",
    "[ polaron_bands ] .",
    "the states at @xmath136 are lost within the afm band .",
    "the results for @xmath106 holes ( @xmath137 , fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_jse0.02_beta50_n148 ] ) are slightly smeared compared to the results for the simple polaron model in fig .",
    "[ polaron20_bands.eps ] , but the similarities are striking .    in order to verify that the addition of holes leads primarily to more small polarons rather than to a growth of the existing ones , we use a dressed corespin correlation function @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the hole density at site @xmath140 related to the electron density via @xmath141 , the sum over @xmath142 is taken over all lattice sites .",
    "this dressed correlation measures the ferromagnetic regions around holes .",
    "figure  [ fig : hss_mcvspolmod ] shows the results for @xmath143 , @xmath135 and @xmath106 holes on @xmath144 sites , which correspond to doping levels of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "the results are almost independent of the doping level @xmath148 and , above all , the ferromagnetic region does not grow with increasing hole density .",
    "the data are compared to those obtained for the independent polaron model introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : fmp ] and show very good agreement .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hss_mcvspolmod ] shows the usual corespin correlation which reveals the afm background . the antiferromagnetism decreases with increasing hole concentration , both for the mc simulations and the idealised polaron model .",
    "however , it shrinks somewhat faster for the full esf model .",
    "the results begin to deviate from the independent polaron results only for doping levels @xmath149 , with a more homogenous phase setting in at @xmath150 . in between",
    ", the polarons attract each other with a tendency to form larger fm clusters in the antiferromagnetic background , which eventually leads to phase separation ( ps ) .",
    "the transition from polarons to ps is not well defined . on increasing hole concentration",
    "the polarons first coexist with larger hole - rich clusters which then grow and finally dominate .",
    "details on this range of doping and on the influence of the afm superexchange parameter @xmath41 are subject of a subsequent publication .",
    "in this paper , the ferromagnetic kondo ( double - exchange ) model in 2d has been analysed by unbiased finite temperature monte - carlo simulations .",
    "it has been found that upon hole doping , small ferromagnetic regions appear around each individual hole while the rest of the lattice stays antiferromagnetically ordered .",
    "each of the ferromagnetic regions contains one single hole .",
    "therefore , the physics close to half filling is not governed by phase separation into larger fm and af regions , as previously reported , but by single - hole ferromagnetic polarons moving in an antiferromagnetic background .    the critical chemical potential  @xmath80 at which holes start to enter the lower kondo band can be found from simplified energy considerations ( eq .  ( [ eq : e_pol ] ) ) . for @xmath46 significantly above @xmath80 , the band",
    "is completely filled and the corespins are antiferromagnetic .",
    "around @xmath80 , holes enter the @xmath10-band , forming isolated fm domains in the shape depicted in fig .",
    "[ polaron_conf ] , each containing one _ single _ hole .",
    "this is corroborated by mc snapshots , the functional dependence of the electron density on the chemical potential , the spectral density and the dressed corespin correlation eq .",
    "( [ eq : hss_def ] ) .",
    "the discontinuity in the electron density vs. the chemical potential ( i.  e. infinite compressibility ) is usually taken as evidence for ps . in the case of the kondo model ,",
    "this discontinuity is a consequence of a large ( macroscopic ) number of degenerate polaron states .",
    "when the chemical potential is close to the energy of these states , the number of holes ( polarons ) in the lattice strongly fluctuates . the weight of the polaron peak in the spectrum is directly linked to the number of holes ( fig .",
    "[ dos_jse0.02_beta50_nvar.eps ] ) . in order to obtain numerical results at a fixed hole number , it was necessary to develop a canonical algorithm for our monte carlo simulations .",
    "another consequence of the formation of single - hole fm polarons is the opening of a pseudogap .",
    "the small fm regions of the polarons contain only a few electronic states that are energetically well separated from each other .",
    "moreover , the width of the antiferromagnetic band is much smaller than the difference between the highest and the lowest polaron states .",
    "therefore , no states can be found for energies between the upper edge of the antiferromagnetic band and the highest state within the polaron .",
    "this gives rise to a pseudogap in the one - particle spectral function .",
    "the same arguments explain the appearance of a mirror gap well below the chemical potential .    a pseudogap is indeed observed in experiments  @xcite and in mc simulations for the kondo model  @xcite .",
    "experiments at low doped la@xmath2ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 showed evidence of small fm droplets in an afm background  @xcite .",
    "our analysis yields compelling evidence against the ps scenario and in favour of fm polarons for small doping in 2d for realistic parameter values for manganites .",
    "a similar behaviour has been previously found for 1d .",
    "furthermore , the coupling to lattice degrees of freedom will additionally localise holes and inhibit the formation of a ferromagnetic phase ( jahn - teller polarons )  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , depending on the value of the hopping parameter @xmath38 , the temperature investigated in this paper ( @xmath134 ) is in a range of @xmath119 , which is in agreement with temperatures in experiments .",
