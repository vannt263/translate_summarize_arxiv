    "for systems with an odd number of electrons per unit cell , correlation effects can lead to insulating magnetic ground states . depending on the relative strength between the interactions @xmath13 and the electron bandwidth or kinetic energy @xmath14 , there are two classes of insulators : a slater insulator@xcite in the weak coupling regime in which the normal state is a non - magnetic metal . below a critical temperature a gap in",
    "the single - particle opens up because of magnetic ordering and consequently the unit cell gets doubled and the brillouin zone folds up . in this regime ,",

    "interpolating between these two limits , the maximum @xmath16 is expected to occur in the crossover regime where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are comparable .    the behavior of @xmath16 in a series of perovskite transition - metal oxides ( tmos ) with the formal @xmath3 electron configuration , including srmno@xmath17 , srtco@xmath17 and naoso@xmath17 , lend support to the above picture .",
    "@xmath18 tmo srmno@xmath17 has a relatively low nel temperature @xmath19  k @xcite for antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering but the insulating behavior persists above @xmath20 , indicating that it is in the strong coupling limit . on the other hand , @xmath21 tmo naoso@xmath17 with an af transition @xmath22  k and a metal - insulator transition that is coincident @xcite appears to be in the weak coupling limit .",
    "finally , @xmath23 tmo srtco@xmath17 shows extremely high af @xmath24  k @xcite , which indicates it is located in the crossover regime @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to note that the crossover behavior associated with high magnetic transition temperatures is realized in double perovskite tmos @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 is an alkali or alkaline earth metal , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two transition metals with different coulomb interaction strengths .",

    "in fact , the observed all - in - all - out magnetic structure is compatible with the structural unit cell @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the metal - insulator transition in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath29 is a lifshitz transition @xcite arising from a reconstruction of the fermi surface , rather than a slater transition .    in this paper",
