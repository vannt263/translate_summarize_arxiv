    "exploring leptonic cp and t violation is one of the most challenging endeavors in particle physics . confirming ( or refuting ) unsuppressed cp violation analogous to that in the quark sector",

    "we should note , however , that it is only after the kamland experiment @xcite which confirmed the msw large mixing angle ( lma ) solution @xcite of the solar neutrino problem that we can talk about detecting cp or t violation in an experimantally realistic setting .",
    "an almost maximal mixing of @xmath5 discovered by the atmospheric neutrino observation by super - kamiokande @xcite , which broke new ground in the field of research , also greatly encourages attempts toward measuring the leptonic kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath6 .",
    "yet , we might have the last impasse to observing leptonic cp violation , a too small value of @xmath7 , which lives in the unique unexplored ( 1 - 3 ) sector of the mns matrix @xcite . currently , it is bounded from above by a modest constraint @xmath8 obtained by the chooz reactor experiment @xcite . toward removing the last impasse , two different methods for measuring @xmath7",
    "are proposed and materialized into a number of concrete experimental programs .",
    "the first is the measurement of appearance probability @xmath9 in long - baseline ( lbl ) experiments using accelerator neutrino beam , being and to be performed by the ongoing @xcite and the next generation projects @xcite .",
    "the second is the reactor measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "it is a pure measurement of @xmath7 independent of other oscillation parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and thus will play a rle complementary to the lbl experiments @xcite . this property is expected to help resolving the parameter degeneracy @xcite related to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a spur of experimental projects that occurred over the globe for the relatively new opportunity are now summarized in the white paper report @xcite .",
    "if such challenges are blessed by nature we will be able to proceed to measuring the leptonic cp or t violating phase @xmath6 .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath7 will allow us to measure it via @xmath10 and @xmath11 appearance measurement using conventional superbeam experiments , whose idea may be traced back to @xcite .",
    "feasible experimental programs for such appearance measurement with upgraded beams as well as detectors are proposed .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for the jparc - hyper - kamiokande project and @xcite for no@xmath12a .",
    "it is also proposed that a fast search for cp violation can be performed by combining neutrino mode operation of such experiments with high statistics reactor measurement of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath7 is too small to be seen in the above experiments an entirely new strategy is called for .",
    "we will probably need more aggressive approach with ambitious beam technologies , neutrino factory @xcite or beta beam @xcite or even both . here also , vigorous world - wide activities for developing beam and target technologies as well as studying physics capabilities are underway @xcite .",
    "intense neutrino beam from a muon storage ring and the clean background for wrong sign muon detection are expected to lead to an enormous sensitivity of @xmath7 up to @xmath13 1 degeree . enriched by golden ( @xmath14 ) @xcite as well as silver ( @xmath15 ) @xcite channels",

    "see @xcite for a review of old and new ideas on how to measure leptonic cp violation .",
    "how does t violation measurement fit into the scene ? to our understanding it will probably come later than cp violation measurement because the measurement is more difficult to carry out . in neutrino factory",
    "it requires electron charge identification which is highly nontrivial , if not impossible . the beta beam ,",
    "if build , would give us an ideal apparatus because it can deliver a pure @xmath16 beam which comes from decaying radioactive nuclei . by combining with superbeam ( or neutrino factory ) measurement of @xmath9",
    "it will provides us a unique opportunity for exploring leptonic t violation .    keeping in mind the scope of experimental realization of cp and t violation measurement in the future , we discuss in this article a unified view of leptonic cp and t violation , one of the most fundamental problems in particle physics .",
    "we hope that our discussion is illuminating and contributes to deeper understanding of the problem . in this paper",
    "we use , except for in appendix , the standard notation of the mns matrix @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time that cp and t conservation are intimately related to each other by the cpt theorem . for neutrino",
    "oscillation in vacuum the invariance leads to a relation between neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities @xmath17 then , the question might be `` if there exists analogous relation in neutrino oscillation in matter ? '' .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that indeed there exists such a relationship , @xmath18 which comes from the classical time reversal and the complex conjugate of the neutrino evolution equation assuming that the matter profile is symmetric about the mid - point between production and detection .",
    "let us call ( [ cpt - ids ] ) the cpt relation in matter . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the fundamental quantity which is related to neutrino s index of refraction in matter @xcite with @xmath20 being the fermi constant , @xmath21 neutrino energy , and @xmath22 an electron number density in the earth .",
    "the mass squared difference of neutrinos is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the @xmath25th eigenstate .",
    "there is an immediate consequence of the cpt relation in matter , eq .",

    "the property may be used to formulate the method for detecting extrinsic cpt violation in neutrino oscillation due to matter effect @xcite .",
    "do the cpt relation and various other relationships between oscillation probabilities give a unified picture of cp and t violation in neutrino oscillation in matter ? in this article",
    "we argue that the answer is indeed yes .",
    "although our argument in this paper is based on the line of thought in @xcite , we believe that we made a step forward from the previous work .",
    "toward the goal of this paper , let us introduce a graphical representation of the characteristic features of neutrino oscillations relevant for leptonic cp violation @xcite",
    ". for simplicity of notations let us define the symbols for cp and t conjugate probabilities , @xmath1 \\equiv p(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\alpha } \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_{\\beta})$ ] and @xmath2 \\equiv p(\\nu_{\\beta } \\rightarrow \\nu_{\\alpha})$ ] , for a given probability @xmath29 .",

    "notice the difference between movement of the direction in @xmath0- @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath0- @xmath1 $ ] plot ; they are orthogonal to each other for reasons explained in the text .",
    "the figure is the same as fig.1 of @xcite apart from that we have changed the convention of @xmath6 to the standard one used in the text of the paper .",
    "the convention is employed by almost everybody who works in the field ( see e. g. , @xcite ) including all our previous works , @xcite , but is different from that of @xcite .",
    "although the convention of the mns matrix is the same , the latter takes a convention such that @xmath30 in the neutrino evolution equation ( [ evolution1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath31 .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    given two observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 $ ] , you can draw a dot in @xmath0- @xmath1 $ ] space , and it becomes a closed ellipse when @xmath6 is varied . in fig .",
    "[ ptp ] the ellipses labeled @xmath32 are the ones for vacuum oscillation probabilities where the subscripts @xmath33 denote the sign of @xmath34 . when the matter effect is turned on they split into two ellipses labeled @xmath35 in the cp bi - probability plot and into @xmath36 in the t bi - probability plot , both of which are simultaneously depicted in fig .",
    "[ ptp ] .",
    "let us first focus on the @xmath0- @xmath1 $ ] bi - probability plot .",
    "we first note that the oscillation probability @xmath37 can be written on very general ground ( for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , or vice versa ) channel , there exist @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms in the oscillation probability and the bi - probability diagrams are no more elliptic . ] as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of @xmath34 , @xmath46 and @xmath28 .",
    "( of course , the previously obtained approximate formulas do have such form .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "it is nothing but ( [ kty ] ) that guarantees the elliptic nature of the trajectories .",
    "then , one can show that the lengths of major and minor axes ( the `` polar '' and `` radial '' thickness of the ellipses ) represent the size of the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 terms , respectively , whereas the distance between two ellipses with positive and negative @xmath34 displays the size of the matter effect @xcite .",
    "finally , the distance to the center of the ellipse from the origin is essentially given by @xmath49 .",
    "notice that all the features of the bi - probability plot except for distance between @xmath50 ellipses are essentially determined by the vacuum parameters in setting of @xmath21 and @xmath51 relevant for the superbeam experiments .",
    "therefore , one can easily guess how it looks like in the other experimental settings . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ ptp ] the cp violating and cp conserving effects of @xmath6 are comparable in size with the matter effect even at such high energy and long baseline .",
    "we notice that in the @xmath0- @xmath2 $ ] bi - probability plot the matter effect splits the vacuum ellipses @xmath32 in quite a different way from the @xmath0- @xmath1 $ ] bi - probability plot .",
    "it is because the t violating measure @xmath52 , which is given by @xmath53 for symmetric matter profiles , vanishes at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the t ( or cp ) conserving point must remain on the diagonal line in @xmath0- @xmath2 $ ] bi - probability plot .",
    "equation  ( [ deltat ] ) stems from the fact that the coefficients except for @xmath44 are symmetric under the interchange @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 even in matter . the matter effect can not create a fake t violation for symmetric matter profiles @xcite . for modifications which occur for asymmetric matter profiles ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "notice that the matter effect can not create fake t violation , it does modify the coefficient @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) , whose feature is made transparent in @xcite . among other things ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the matter effect can enhance the t asymmetry up to a factor of 1.5 .",
    "other earlier references on t violation in neutrino oscillation include @xcite .",
    "in view of fig .",
    "( [ ptp ] ) we notice a remarkable feature of the simultaneous @xmath0-@xmath1 $ ] and @xmath0-@xmath2 $ ] diagrams ; it has a square or diamond shape .",
    "the diamond shaped structure of combined @xmath0-@xmath1 $ ] and @xmath0-@xmath2 $ ] diagrams can be understood by the following two relations which are called the cp - cp and the t - cp relations in @xcite .",
    "their precise statements are :    0.2 cm    cp - cp relation : @xmath58    0.2 cm    t - cp relation : @xmath59 these relations are meant to be valid in leading order in @xmath60 , i.e. , in zeroth order in @xmath6-independent and to first order in @xmath6-dependent terms , respectively .    roughly speaking",
    ", the cp - cp relation guarantees that the locations of the first and the third bases are approximately symmetric under reflection with respect to the diagonal line in @xmath0-@xmath1 $ ] space , whereas the t - cp relation guarantees that the ordinates of the @xmath36 ellipse are approximately the same as those of @xmath61 . of course , one has to specify the values of the cp phase @xmath6 to make the relationship precise , and that is why the change in @xmath6 is involved between the rhs and the lhs of eqs.([cp - cp ] ) and ( [ t - cp ] ) .",
    "a rough sketch of the argument given in @xcite is as follows . the first equality in ( [ cp - cp ] )",
    "is obvious by noticing @xmath62 which follows from the fact that a complex conjugate of the neutrino evolution equation gives the same oscillation probability , and the simple relation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath63 then , the second approximate equality follows to leading order in @xmath3 after appropriate shift of @xmath6 which takes care of the sign change in @xmath6 dependent terms .    for the t - cp relation the first equality in ( [ t - cp ] ) can be derived by using ( [ ccid ] ) in the cpt relation in matter ( [ cpt - ids ] ) .",
    "then , the second approximate equality holds for small @xmath3 with the same adjustment of the phase @xmath6 .",
    "we now point out that the the cp - cp and the t - cp relations are equivalent to each other in their physics contents . roughly speaking , the t - cp relation is `` t conjugate '' of the cp - cp relation .",
    "it reflects the relationships among various neutrino oscillation probabilities discussed in the previous section .",
    "their equivalence again testifies for the unity of cp and t violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "we present the proof of the above statement through the computation of the corrections to the cp - cp and the t - cp relations .",
    "let us define for clarity of notations the deviation from the cp - cp and the t - cp relations as @xmath64 because of the first equality in ( [ cp - cp ] ) , @xmath65 can be written as @xmath66 on the other hand , by using the first equality in ( [ cp - cp ] ) and the relation @xmath67 which is valid for symmetric matter density profiles , @xmath68 can be cast into the form @xmath69 therefore , it holds that @xmath70 namely , the relation ( [ deltapt ] ) is the t - conjugate of ( [ deltapcp ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof that the cp - cp and the t - cp relations are identical in their content .",
    "in passing , we note the following : it was noted in @xcite that there exists an approximate symmetry in the vacuum oscillation probability under the simultaneous transformations @xmath71 and @xmath72 which explains almost overlap of @xmath73 and @xmath74 trajectories as in fig .",
    "a generalization of the approximate symmetry into the case with matter effect has been obtained @xcite , @xmath75 from which the cp - cp and the t - cp relations also follow .",
    "clearly , the correction to the approximate symmetry is also related to @xmath65 . to show this , we define the difference @xmath76 between the lhs and the rhs of ( [ flipsym2 ] ) , @xmath77 using the frequently used identity , one can show that @xmath78 thus , @xmath79 ; they are identical .",
    "we now compute the leading - order corrections to the cp - cp and the t - cp relations . during the course of the computation",
    ", we will give an explicit proof of these relations .",
    "we start from the kimura - takamura - yokomakura ( kty ) formula @xcite of the oscillation probability , eq .  ( [ kty ] ) .",
    "we note that the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of @xmath46 , @xmath34 , and the matter coefficient @xmath28 , but we here suppress dependences on the latter two quantities .",
    "we also note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 start from first order in @xmath46 , so that we can write @xmath80 and @xmath81 . using the fact that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84\\cos \\delta + [ b(\\delta m^2_{21})+b(-\\delta m^2_{21})]\\sin \\delta   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ c(\\delta m^2_{21})-c(-\\delta m^2_{21 } ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ \\alpha(\\delta m^2_{21 } ) - \\alpha(-\\delta m^2_{21 } ) ]   \\delta m^2_{21 } \\cos \\delta + [ \\beta(\\delta m^2_{21 } ) - \\beta(-\\delta m^2_{21 } ) ]   \\delta m^2_{21 } \\sin \\delta   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ c(\\delta m^2_{21 } ) - c(-\\delta m^2_{21 } ) ] .",
    "\\label{deltacp3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we have shown that the rhs of ( [ deltacp3 ] ) is of order @xmath85 ( @xmath45 term ) , or @xmath86 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 terms ) .",
    "this is an explicit proof of the cp - cp relation , and hence also the t - cp relation .",
    "we are now left with the computation of the first - order terms of @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the exact form of these coefficients are calculated in @xcite . in eq .",

    "but the contributions from terms higher order in @xmath96 cancel in ( [ deltacpfinal ] ) .",
    "the feature that the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 start with first - order terms of @xmath46 played an important rle in proving the cp - cp relation to leading order .",
    "it comes from the fact that they vanish in the two flavor limit @xmath97 and that the probabilities allow taylor expansion in terms of the variable .",
    "the former statement is proved in appendix on very general ground without assuming adiabaticity or constant matter density .",
    "in this contribution to the focus issue on neutrino physics we have presented a new unified view of the leptonic cp and t violation in neutrino oscillation . based on the cpt relation in matter and other relations obeyed by the oscillation probabilities which are derived in @xcite we were able to complete our understanding of the structure of unified description of cp and t violation in terms of bi - probability plot .",
    "namely , the diamond shaped structure of simultaneous @xmath0- @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath0- @xmath2 $ ] bi - probability plot is now understood as a consequence of a unique relation , the cp - cp ( or the equivalently , the t - cp ) relation . based on this observation and relying on the kty formula we have computed leading order corrections to the cp - cp relation .",
    "we have also briefly touched upon the basic features of the t violating measure which are in contrast with those of cp violation .",
    "they include vanishing t violating measure at vanishing cp phase @xmath6 , and the enhancement of t violating asymmetry by the matter effect up to a factor of 1.5 .",
    "though measurement of t violation should give us a cleaner way of detecting genuine cp violating effects , it is not easy to carry out experimentally .",
    "we must wait for the construction of an intense electron ( anti- ) neutrino beam either by beta beam @xcite or in neutrino factories @xcite .",

    "one can show that the same conclusion holds for different choice of the phase matrix from that in ( [ ckm ] ) .    since absence or presence of t violation should not depend on the parametrization used , this completes the proof that the @xmath6 dependence disappears from all the oscillation probabilities in the limit @xmath123 .",

    "<S> , we make a step forward toward deeper understanding of the unified graphical representation by showing that these two relations are identical in its content , suggesting a truly unifying view of cp and t violation in neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that the unity reflects the underlying cpt theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we also present calculation of corrections to the cp - cp and the t - cp relations to leading order in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    </S>",
