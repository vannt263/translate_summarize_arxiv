    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the efficiency of two stochastic propagator based alternatives to the sequential propagator method used in all of the above calculations .",
    "the calculation we focus on is the semileptonic decay of a heavy - light pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath8 ) to a light - light pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath9 ) . for processes",
    "@xmath10 the differential decay rate can be parameterized as a product of ckm matrix elements , perturbatively known quantities , and poorly known non - perturbative quantities , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the squared difference between the initial and final state four - momenta and @xmath13 .",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty in the theoretical calculation of the decay rate is due to the non - perturbative interactions parameterized by the form factor @xmath14 .",
    "these interactions appear in the hadronic matrix element @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a weak flavor - changing vector current and @xmath17 is the charm heavy - quark and @xmath18 is the @xmath19 or @xmath20 daughter - quark spinor .",
    "the matrix element can be parameterized as a linear combination of the vector , @xmath21 , and scalar , @xmath22 , form factors , @xmath23 on the lattice the matrix element is extracted from three - point functions of the following form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spectator - antiquark spinor , @xmath26 is the propagator for quark flavor @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the time - slice at which the sink is fixed .",
    "the three - point function is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : c3 ] . in the limit of large time separations eq .",
    "( [ eq : c3 ] ) has the form , @xmath29 the wave - function amplitudes , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and energies can be removed by forming ratios with or performing simultaneous fits to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 meson two - point functions , @xmath34    ) .",
    "point - to - all propagators are used for the daughter - quark and spectator - antiquark .",
    "the heavy - quark propagator is constructed either by sequential or by stochastic all - to - all propagator techniques .",
    "[ fig : c3 ] ]    currently , the approach of most lattice calculations of semileptonic decay rates of @xmath7 mesons involves constructing the three - point functions using a so - called sequential ( or extended ) propagator , the sequential propagator method @xcite . as is shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c3 ] ) , this method uses two light - quark , point - to - all propagators @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which may or may not be mass degenerate .",
    "it is routinely the case that these computationally expensive ( expensive relative to the heavy - quark propagator ) light - quark propagators have been previously generated to study other lattice quantities , and then stored .",
    "for example , the pseudoscalar pion mass is required to guide chiral extrapolations of many lattice quantities .    to construct the desired three - point functions ,",
    "the light - quark propagators are combined via the sequential propagator method with the heavy - quark propagator generated  on - the - fly \" .",
    "the point - to - all light - quark propagators connect the source , at @xmath37 , to the current at @xmath38 and sink at @xmath39 .",
    "a point source is sufficient because of translational invariance .",
    "the heavy - quark propagator , @xmath40^{\\dagger } \\gamma_5 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c3 ] ) , must then connect all lattice sites at the vector current time - slice to all lattice sites at the sink time - slice .",
    "this is achieved by solving the heavy - quark action on the spectator - antiquark propagator sink at a given time - slice @xmath28 , with a momentum and @xmath41 matrix insertion .",
    "although inverting the heavy - quark action with a @xmath42 corresponding to the charm quark mass is inexpensive , relative to the calculation of the light - quark propagators , this approach requires an additional 12 heavy - quark solves for every spectator - quark , @xmath7 meson momentum , and/or @xmath7 meson smearing .",
    "if several combinations of these parameters are wanted , the cost of calculating the heavy - quark propagators becomes significant .",
    "in particular , at small lattice spacings the momenta are more finely grained , and therefore more three - point functions will have an appreciable signal , requiring many more heavy - quark solves if all data are to be utilized .    another approach is the one - end method .",
    "this method combines sequential propagator techniques with stochastic propagators , through the so - called  one - end trick \" as described for two - point functions in refs .",
    "the method has been used successfully in form factor calculations in light - light systems @xcite .",
    "this method provides an additional volume average and momentum projection which may greatly reduce the gauge noise in the correlators .",
    "however , additional propagators are required for every source and sink momentum combination , suggesting it is computationally expensive relative to the sequential propagator method .",
    "nevertheless , there is the possibility that the three - point function noise is so greatly reduced that very few momentum points would be required in the @xmath43 extrapolation and a gain in the overall efficiency is realized .    a more flexible method than the previous two that we also investigate in this paper uses an all - to - all @xcite , stochastically generated , propagator to connect the sink to the current .",
    "we will refer to this approach as the stochastic propagator method . with this method all momenta and",
    "sink smearings are in principle available using only a single spin - color inversion .",
    "in addition , no new heavy - quark inversions would be required to calculate the three - point function using multiple ( previously generated ) spectator - quark propagators on the same configuration , as might be useful for chiral extrapolations in the valence light - quark mass .",
    "there is also the interesting possibility that correlators could be generated with multiple current and sink time slices with no additional inversions .",
    "as we will show , the stochastic noise is significant and must be reduced by averaging over multiple noise vectors and partitioning @xcite . in particular , time partitioning is required for efficient reduction of noise , even when using other variance reduction techniques such as the hopping parameter acceleration ( hpa ) @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we study and minimize the stochastic noise appearing in the methods using variance reduction techniques . comparing the errors and costs of the three methods in sec .",
    "[ comps ] , we determine the one - end method to be inefficient but the stochastic propagator method to be promising .",
    "we discuss when the stochastic propagator method is more efficient than the sequential propagator method , and finally apply the method to determine @xmath2 on a single ensemble .",
    "this study is an extension of our preliminary results presented in ref .",
    ".simulation parameters for the 2 qcdsf ensembles @xmath44 and @xmath45 used .",
    "the scale was set from @xmath46 fm , which was obtained by chirally extrapolating the nucleon mass times @xmath47 , @xmath48 , to the physical point at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "[ tab : params ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen in the calculation above we chose a very expensive one - end procedure to perform this calculation , the one - end sink method ; however , even the one - end source method would be much costlier than the sequential or stochastic propagator method .",
    "we mention again that the one - end sink method was chosen to minimize the error , and so the cheaper one - end source method would be even noisier",
    ". the one - end methods at these quark masses and volumes are evidently not close to being competitive with the other two approaches , and we drop these methods from further consideration .",
    "+      in this section we compare the two more promising methods , as suggested by the plots and rough cost calculation from the last subsection .",
    "we perform a direct comparison of the sequential and stochastic propagator methods to determine when it is advantageous to use the stochastic propagator method .",
    "+    as a first step in an effort to understand the behavior of the noise present in both methods we examine the effects of smearing . @xmath50 with two different smearings",
    "is shown in figs .",
    "[ smrcomp : a][smrcomp : b ] for the two ensembles .",
    "we remind the reader that in this setting , in the limit @xmath51 , the stochastic method will yield exactly the same result as the sequential method . the results from 100 configurations on ensemble @xmath44",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ smrcomp : a ] , and for 220 configurations on ensemble @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ smrcomp : b ] .",
    "the behavior of the gauge noise can be directly seen from the sequential propagator method correlators .",
    "it decreases slightly with distance from the @xmath7 meson sink regardless of smearing .",
    "the contribution of the stochastic error can be determined by comparing with this purely gauge error : for all smearings and both ensembles it is negligible compared to the gauge noise near the stochastic source at the @xmath7 meson sink , but grows mildly with distance from the source .",
    "the effects of smearing on the gauge and stochastic noises are both mild , and smearing clearly helps to produce cleaner plateaus .",
    "we now compare the total errors of both methods using the five statistically cleanest combinations of correlators with finite momenta on ensemble @xmath45 , where each combination of correlators corresponds to a particular @xmath53 and @xmath14 .",
    "when averaging over so many equivalent correlators it is more straightforward to extract the form factors from the appropriate combination of matrix elements and kinematic factors , and then perform the average .",
    "the energies needed for this construction are determined from bootstrap ensembles of two - point fits .",
    "these are then combined with the corresponding bootstrap ensembles of the three - point correlators .",
    "we assume only three @xmath7 meson momenta are desired ( on these lattices , @xmath7 mesons with momentum @xmath54 have significantly distorted dispersion relations ) : @xmath55 we average over all rotationally equivalent correlators to improve the statistics ; however , there are many correlators with rotationally equivalent sink momenta which are not available to the sequential propagator method but are essentially free for the stochastic propagator method .",
    "these additional momenta are utilized in the stochastic case .",
    "we also consider the same momentum range for the pion ( on these lattices and valence quark masses correlators with @xmath56 are too noisy to produce a clear signal ) .",
    "both methods have the same rotationally equivalent source momenta available . figs .",
    "[ fig : a][fig : e ] are representative of the range of behavior of the relative errors in our data set .",
    "the number of correlators averaged over is shown below each figure for both methods .",
    "the sequential propagator method uses @xmath57 heavy - quark inversions to generate the correlators .",
    "the stochastic propagator method uses @xmath58 . as suggested in figs .",
    "[ fig : err ] and [ smrcomp : a][smrcomp : b ] , less vectors could be used without a significant increase of the error . however , as seen in the cost estimation in the previous section of a realistic calculation , choosing @xmath59 is still cheaper ( although modestly ) than the sequential method . if we performed a naive fixed cost comparison with no assumptions about what constitutes a realistic data set , only 9 spin diluted vectors ( requiring 36 heavy - quark solves ) could be used , and the stochastic contribution to the total error in the stochastic propagator method would increase approximately by a factor of 1.6 . as the stochastic error is a small percentage of the total error ( the worst case appears in fig .",
    "[ smrcomp : b ] in time slices 1 - 10 , where the stochastic error accounts for @xmath60 of the total error ) the stochastic propagator method would still be competitive with the sequential propagator method for most data points .",
    "+     +   +    we have examined all correlators with an appreciable signal and draw the conclusion that with the modest number of 24 full time and spin partitioned stochastic estimates the error in the stochastic correlators is at worst comparable to the error in the sequential correlators , while at best the additional data available result in smaller total errors for the stochastic propagator method .",
    "it is also clear that the stochastic propagator method is much more flexible , because additional sink smearings , sink interpolating fields , and spectator quark masses do not add significantly to the cost of the calculation . in the next section we use",
    "the stochastic propagator method generated correlators to perform a @xmath43 extrapolation .",
    "in order to connect our results to observables of phenomenological interest we perform the matching and @xmath1 improvement of the vector current .",

    "the matching factor @xmath64 is known non - perturbatively @xcite , while the coefficient of the improvement term , @xmath65 , is known to one - loop in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we have examined the effects of @xmath1 improvement and they do not change the behavior of the noise .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar relation to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath53 can be directly related to the scalar current , holds to the order at which we are working .",
    "the observation the authors make in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the continuum ward identity , @xmath66 is valid on the lattice up to a multiplicative matching factor . for the hisq action @xcite , which they use",
    ", they obtain , @xmath67 this relation holds because the right hand side is renormalization group invariant when the same action is used for both valence quarks .    due to the anti - symmetry of the tensor operator",
    "this relationship is also valid when using wilson - type quarks , and allows us to calculate @xmath53 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "we extract @xmath70 using this approach as well as using the conventional approach with the vector current .    as in the comparisons shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] , to extract the form factors we first combine the appropriate three - point correlators , which are proportional to the vector matrix element , using the same bootstrap samples for all rotationally equivalent components , so that the resulting correlators in time are proportional to the form factors : @xmath71 we then form the ratio from the bootstrap ensembles of our two - point and three - point functions , @xmath72 and remove @xmath73 and @xmath74 using our two - point fit results . it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] that the plateaus in the first two correlators are not clear .",
    "the lack of clear plateaus requires us to include excited states in our fits . to do this we determine the energy differences between the first excited state and ground state from two - state fits to the two - point functions . using the energy differences we can perform a three parameter fit to extract the form factors , @xmath75 and",
    "obtain reasonable @xmath76 values .",

    "the form factors are plotted versus @xmath79 , where @xmath80 gev @xcite .",
    "530 configurations with 24 stochastic vectors and 4 different time sources on every lattice were used .",
    "we also present results , in fig .",
    "[ ffs24 ] , for the same calculation using the relation eq .",
    "( [ f0tos ] ) .",
    "this is advantageous because no matching coefficients are required , removing a source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the two approaches to constructing the @xmath22 correlators are in all cases comparable within statistical errors ; however , we find the statistical errors of the scalar current based data to be slightly larger . the @xmath43 extrapolation is performed using the beirevi and kaidalov parameterization @xcite , @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",

    "reasonable @xmath76 were obtained using @xmath87 or @xmath88 , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the errors are statistical only .",
    "of course to extract physical results from any of these methods we would need to perform a chiral and lattice spacing extrapolation .",
    "we note that these results are in agreement with the value @xmath91 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most recent lattice calculation where systematic errors are estimated .",
    "we have studied two stochastic based methods , the one - end method and stochastic propagator method , for calculating three - point functions in heavy - light semileptonic decays .",
    "the efficiency of these methods was optimized by minimizing the statistical noise , while taking into account the cost incurred by the different set - ups and variance reduction techniques .",
    "we found that the noise was reduced when placing the stochastic sources at the sink rather than at the current insertion of the three - point functions .",
    "this enables us to vary the position of the current but requires that the distance between source and sink is fixed , very similar to the sequential propagator method .",
    "the one - end method naively appears promising because of the additional volume average it induces , which also has the effect of projecting out the desired momentum at the source .",
    "this creates the possibility of reducing the statistical errors , but at a high computational cost . in our analysis",
    "this method clearly fails to outperform the other methods , suggesting it is a poor alternative in heavy - light three - point functions .",
    "the stochastic propagator method is competitive with the sequential propagator method , and in many cases superior , due to the additional momenta freely available .",
    "the stochastic propagator method is also more versatile , since correlators with different sink smearings , sink interpolating operators , and spectator quark masses can be computed at negligible cost .",
    "this flexibility would allow calculations with the variational method and/or partial quenching to be performed with greater efficiency .",
    "this should further improve with finer lattice spacing , where the momenta are more finely grained .",
    "we have used the stochastic propagator method to calculate the semileptonic form factors at many different values of @xmath92 s , using both the vector current and scalar current .",
    "our data are parameterized well by the beirevi and kaidalov expressions .",
    "the results for the @xmath43 extrapolation , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , calculated from the vector and scalar current respectively , are comparable to previous determinations . in the future",
    "we will extend this calculation to additional quark masses and lattice spacings , taking advantage of the method s flexibility to improve plateaus and reduce statistical errors .",
