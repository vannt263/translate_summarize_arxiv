    "one of the current theoretical challenges in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is to describe high energy interactions with hadrons in terms of fundamental field theory .",
    "it is observed that high - energy hadron - hadron scattering interactions become completely absorptive ( black ) at small impact parameters so that elastic scattering can be viewed essentially as a shadow of the inelastic cross section in the sense of babinet s principle .",
    "if this regime occurs at most of the impact parameters which contribute to the inelastic cross section , then the elastic and inelastic cross sections are equal .",
    "this limit is often referred to as the black body limit ( bbl ) in analogy with the quantum mechanical situation of scattering from an absorptive share of radius @xmath11 in which case the total cross section is equal to @xmath12 , ( see e.g. , problem 1 of section 131 in ref  .@xcite ) .",
    "this limit is also loosely referred to as the unitarity limit , although unitarity alone admits cross sections as large as @xmath13 provided there are no inelastic interactions ( see e.g. , problem 2 of section 132 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper we will assume , in line with experiment , that the amplitude is predominantly imaginary . in this case , the unitarity limit coincides with the bbl .",
    "the black body limit in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is an interesting new regime in qcd where the coupling strength is small , but where the leading twist approximation breaks down and new small coupling methods are needed . in order to understand the transition to the bbl ,",
    "it is important to construct models which accurately describe @xmath2 scattering over a wide range of kinematic variables . in particular",
    ", such a model should interpolate smoothly between the nonperturbative domain and the region where interactions are accurately described by leading twist perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . in a recent paper by munier _",
    "@xcite , an estimate of the proximity to the bbl for the interaction of a color dipole with a proton was made using data from diffractive electroproduction of @xmath7-mesons @xcite .",
    "the techniques used in @xcite are limited by the need to model the @xmath7-meson wave function , as well as by limited information on the @xmath1-dependence for @xmath7 production . within the impact parameter representation",
    ", this means that their predictions are constrained to intermediate values of impact parameter ( @xmath14 fm ) @xcite .",
    "( it will be important to keep in mind the distinction between impact parameter , @xmath15 , and dipole size , @xmath16 . )",
    "we will find that our analysis is valid down to very small values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we will make an improved estimate of the onset of the bbl by combining information from dis and @xmath0 production .",
    "a great advantage of our technique is that , unlike models which are restricted to using meson production data , our model is valid down to very small dipole sizes because we utilize leading twist pqcd for calculations involving small size @xmath17 pairs . within our model of @xmath2 interactions",
    ", we always assume that the virtual photon can be written as a linear combination of hadronic states .",
    "furthermore , we relate the hardness of the interaction to the size of the hadronic state as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we take into account the dependence of the hadronic interaction on the virtuality of the original photon .",
    "large size configurations constitute the soft component of the interaction whereas small size @xmath17 pairs constitute the hard component .    modeling the @xmath2 interaction",
    "requires making three principle observations .",
    "the first is to recall that the total cross section for small size dipole configurations ( @xmath18 fm ) is known within the framework of perturbation theory down to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we will have a complete picture of the interaction of small size configurations with nucleons if we can extract the @xmath1-dependence from experimental data . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss how the @xmath1-dependence of the small size @xmath17 pairs can be extracted from @xmath19 production data .",
    "secondly , we note that the soft scattering of large size hadronic configurations is well understood phenomenologically in terms of effective pomeron exchange .",
    "hence , our model should reproduce the pion - nucleon amplitude for hadronic configurations comparable to the size of the pion ( @xmath20 fm ) . finally , we must model the behavior of the amplitude for intermediate hadronic sizes ( @xmath21 fm @xmath22 fm ) .",
    "this is an interesting and poorly understood region of kinematics , and our model will allow for readjustments in the transition region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a system was devised for relating the transverse size of a @xmath17 dipole to the virtuality , @xmath23 .",
    "the pqcd result for the inelastic @xmath2 cross section was interpolated to large size hadronic configurations and matched to the total cross section for pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "the hadronic size , @xmath16 , is used to interpolate between the hard and soft regions in this paper as it was in ref .",
    "@xmath16 represents the transverse size of a quark - antiquark pair in the limit that @xmath16 is very small ( @xmath24 fm ) .",
    "however , as @xmath16 grows large , the dipole picture becomes inappropriate since the hadronic components that correspond to soft interactions consist of large , complex hadronic states .",
    "larger values of @xmath16 should be interpreted as transverse sizes of general hadronic components of the virtual photon wave function .",
    "the cross section takes the form familiar from perturbation theory : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is a universal scaling ansatz used to relate energy scales , @xmath4 , to transverse dipole sizes , @xmath16 ; @xmath27 is the light - cone fraction for the gluon attached to the @xmath17 loop .",
    "one manifestation of the qcd factorization theorem is that the contribution of hadronic configurations within the photon to the longitudinal cross section , @xmath28 , is peaked around a narrow range of small dipole sizes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is chosen so that , within the perturbative region , @xmath30 is approximately the average dipole size contributing to @xmath28 . for large @xmath4 , @xmath29 takes on values of the order of 10 .",
    "in fact , it is found that @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend very weakly on the value of @xmath29 within the perturbative region of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "changing the value of @xmath29 thereby provides a universal parameter for tuning the cross section within the transition region . in this paper , we use @xmath33 because it is found that @xmath33 best describes @xmath0 data over a wide range of kinematics ( both perturbative and nonperturbative ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lambda ] compares the profile function for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the function used in ref .",
    "@xcite to interpolate between the hard and soft regions matches smoothly to the pqcd result at small @xmath16 and to the pion - proton cross section at large @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , it takes into consideration the breakdown of the leading twist formula in the small @xmath3 limit .    notice that the @xmath17 pair is not a fundamental object since it is always produced off - shell by a virtual photon",
    "this is taken into account on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqcd ] ) through implicit dependence of @xmath35 , on @xmath23 and @xmath4 ( see ref .  @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ eq : xprime ] ) ) .",
    "the dependence of the dipole cross section on the external photon virtuality , @xmath4 , is a feature that is absent in other models such as the one proposed by wsthoff and golec - biernat  @xcite .",
    "this point will be important for what we discuss later because it means that we can not speak unambiguously about the dipole cross section with referring to the interaction for which it is a sub - proccess .    in this paper , we will model the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath36 elastic scattering amplitude ( which , of course , can not be observed experimentally ) using data from @xmath37 photo(electro)-production in conjunction with the pion - proton elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "as when we model the behavior of the total cross section in various kinematic regions , we model the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath38 amplitude by considering three distinct steps .",
    "first , we model the @xmath1-dependence of the small size @xmath39 configurations .",
    "because of transverse squeezing in the @xmath37 wave function , data taken from @xmath37 production is appropriate for use in modeling the @xmath1-dependence of small size , hard scale @xmath39 configurations .",
    "next , the @xmath1-dependence of soft , large size hadronic configurations is approximated by the pion structure function , the pion being a reasonable approximation to a large size hadronic component of the virtual photon wave function . for soft interactions , a factor for soft pomeron exchange",
    "is included to account for the slow rise in cross section at small @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we use the transverse size , @xmath16 , as a parameter to interpolate between hard and soft physics . in our analysis",
    ", we will transform our expression for the amplitude into the impact parameter picture to look for the regions where the impact parameter space amplitude approaches the unitarity limit , and thus to estimate the values of the impact parameter where the bbl is attained .",
    "it should be noted that our model has limitations which restrict how it can be applied .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqcd ] ) is multiplied by a color factor of 9/4 when the hadronic configuration is a color singlet composed of octet representations of su(3 ) , as in a gluon dipole .",
    "such interactions are expected to be abundant in the small @xmath3 limit , so the bbl will be reached at larger impact parameters than what is predicted by considering only the interactions of small size @xmath17 pairs . furthermore , at very small @xmath3 , effects from cross section fluctuations of the virtual photon become important , and taking into account only elastic dipole scattering becomes inappropriate .",
    "in particular , the total cross section in hadron - hadron scattering has a significant contribution from inelastic diffraction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , miettinen and pumplin write the contribution from inelastic diffraction in terms of fluctuations around hadronic eigenstates .",
    "estimates of the contribution from hadronic fluctuations to the cross section show that it is not negligible ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "in fact , with a decrease of the dipole size , the relative importance of inelastic diffraction increases .",
    "the importance of inelastic diffraction for small @xmath39 sizes is discussed , for example , in ref .",
    "the important point to note here is that inelastic diffraction will contribute to the breakdown of the leading twist approximation at low @xmath3 before the bbl for elastic scattering of the hadronic configurations in the photon wave function is reached . as such , we do not seek to place an absolute boundary on the region where corrections to the dglap evolution equation become relevant .",
    "rather , we construct a model that puts a lower limit in impact parameter space on regions approaching the bbl .",
    "furthermore , since the leading twist approximation is not accurate in the vicinity of the unitarity limit , the bbl establishes a lower limit in impact parameter space on regions where the dglap equation is applicable .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we outline our model for the @xmath1-dependence of the hadronic configuration - nucleon amplitude . in sect .",
    "[ sec : impact ] , we transform our expression for the amplitude into the impact parameter representation and study the proximity of the profile function to the unitarity limit as a function of impact parameter , @xmath15 .",
    "we write the transverse and longitudinal cross sections , @xmath40 , as convolutions of the dipole cross section with the photon wave function in sect .  [",
    "sec : gamma ] .",
    "section  [ sec : gamma ] concludes with a calculation of the fraction of the @xmath38 cross section due to large values of the hadronic profile function . in sect .",
    "[ sec : compare ] , we compare our results to an earlier study of the s - matrix @xmath1-dependence in impact parameter space . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nuclear ] we perform the same calculation for the situation where the target is a @xmath8pb nucleus .",
    "for the case of a nuclear target , we match the pqcd calculation at small @xmath16 to the glauber multiple scattering theory result at large @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we summarize our observations in the conclusion .",
    "starting with the expression for the total cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqcd ] ) , we devise a model for the scattering amplitude by writing it in the form , @xmath41 where @xmath42 accounts for the @xmath1-dependence of the interaction , and @xmath43 is determined from the qcd improved dipole picture ( eq .  ( [ eq : pqcd ] ) ) .",
    "the `` hat '' on @xmath43 is to distinguish the total cross section for the scattering of one component of the photon wave function from the total @xmath38 cross section which we consider in sect .",
    "[ sec : gamma ] . applying the optical theorem in the large @xmath44 limit reproduces @xmath45 .",
    "for now we assume that the amplitude is purely imaginary .",
    "we will return to the question of a real part of the amplitude at the end of sect .",
    "[ sec : impact ] .    in this section",
    ", we will make an estimate of the form of @xmath42 which will take into account the nonzero size of the @xmath17 dipole and which will smoothly interpolate between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes using the hadronic size , @xmath16 , as a parameter .",
    "we act in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite by modeling the @xmath1-dependence of the amplitude in the soft and hard regimes and by using @xmath16 to build a smooth interpolation .",
    "the three steps : building a model for the small dipole region , building a model for the large wave - packet region , and interpolating between the two regions are outlined in the next three paragraphs .",
    "we start by writing the general structure of the amplitude .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence , @xmath46 , is written as the product of three functions @xmath47 here and in the rest of this section , the dependence of @xmath48 upon @xmath44 is replaced by dependence upon @xmath3 and @xmath16 . @xmath49 describes the @xmath1-dependence of the nucleon target , @xmath50 describes the @xmath1-dependence of the hadronic projectile , and @xmath51 accounts for gribov diffusion .",
    "this method of separating the @xmath1-dependence into three factors corresponding to different sources of @xmath1-dependence is similar to what is used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next task is to model the small dipole size @xmath1-dependence .",
    "both the soft pomeron exchange factor and the hadronic form factor must approach unity as the size , @xmath16 , shrinks to zero .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem implies that the @xmath1-dependence of the small dipole - nucleon amplitude is universal .",
    "hence , it can be extracted directly from @xmath0 photo(electro)-production since the @xmath0 wave function is known to be a small size wave - packet  @xcite .",
    "data from @xmath0 production reveal that the two - gluon form factor is , @xmath52 the subscript , 1 , labels the two - gluon form factor and @xmath53 is a measurable parameter in the two - gluon form factor .",
    "the value , @xmath54 gev@xmath10 is extracted from data in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a detailed discussion of the two - gluon form factor in @xmath37 production , see ref .  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "it was discussed in detail how , due to the transverse squeezing of the @xmath0 wave function , the @xmath1-dependence of the amplitude comes solely from the two - gluon form factor . in particular , it was found that the dipole form factor contributes only about @xmath55 gev@xmath56 to the slope of the @xmath1-dependence .",
    "the assumption that only the gluon form factor is relevant for @xmath0 production has been successfully tested against data in refs .",
    "hence , in the limit of small dipole sizes , @xmath57    next we construct a model for the large wave packet behavior .",
    "when the hadronic state has a large size , the @xmath1-dependence receives contributions from sources other than the two - gluon form factor .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : largesize ] ) in the form , @xmath58 now , @xmath59 is the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon which is known phenomenologically to take the form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 gev@xmath10 .",
    "large size hadronic configurations can be reasonably expected to have @xmath1-dependence similar to the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "thus , for the hadronic form factor we use the well - known form of the pion form factor , @xmath62 with @xmath63 gev@xmath10 . here , @xmath64 is the characteristic size of the pion , and takes on a value of approximately @xmath65 fm .",
    "this value for the pion size is consistent with what is used in the matching ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite and agrees well with data for the @xmath66n cross section in ref .",
    "for low-@xmath3 soft scattering there is also a factor that arises from gribov diffusion effects : @xmath67 the factor , @xmath51 , describes the exchange of a soft pomeron with regge slope @xmath68 gev@xmath56 and @xmath69 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 is determined by the boundary of the region where gribov diffusion effects become significant .",
    "finally , we must find a reasonable way to interpolate between the hard and the soft regions .",
    "we use the @xmath1-dependence discussed in the previous two paragraphs to guess the following form for the hadronic configuration - nucleon amplitude :    @xmath71    in order to give the variation with @xmath16 geometric behavior , we use @xmath72 as a parameter . to interpolate between the nucleon and the two - gluon form factors , we have defined the function ,",
    "@xmath73 note that when @xmath16 equals @xmath64 , @xmath74 is the product of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nucleon ] ) , ( [ eq : pion ] ) , and ( [ eq : diff ] ) . in the small @xmath16 limit , the dipole form factor and the pomeron form factor approach unity , @xmath75 , and the limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallsize ] ) is recovered .",
    "varying @xmath72 interpolates smoothly between the hard and soft regions .",
    "note that we neglect a possible small @xmath3 dependence of @xmath49 at @xmath76 .",
    "( see the discussion in ref .",
    ") however , our model is adjusted to reproduce the observed @xmath3-dependence of the slope for photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "having obtained eq .  ( [ eq : ourmodel ] ) , the next step is to transform to the impact parameter representation where the profile function is defined by the relation , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . the subscript , @xmath79 , indicates that we are considering the profile function for the scattering of a single hadronic component of the photon wave function from the proton .",
    "we get the profile function by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) , @xmath80 for an imaginary amplitude , the bbl is reached when @xmath81 and the elastic and inelastic cross sections are equal .",
    "recall that if a singlet dipole consists of color octet representations of su(3 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqcd ] ) has an extra factor of @xmath82 , so the bbl for the interaction of a hadronic configuration with the nucleon is certainly reached for @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath84 , we conclude that the interaction takes place near the bbl . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will suppress explicit reference to the argument , @xmath44 , in the profile function .",
    "we have plotted the function @xmath85 for different values of the dipole size and @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleg ] .",
    "we have used gluon distributions from cteq5l in the perturbative calculation of @xmath43 @xcite . recall from the introduction that our model requires that we specify the external photon virtuality .",
    "since we are interested in the possibility of reaching the bbl at a few gev@xmath5 , we have set @xmath86 gev@xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleg ] .",
    "a gaussian ansatz is commonly used in experiments to extrapolate the @xmath1-dependence to large values .",
    "let us , therefore , briefly compare the behavior of our model to that of a simple gaussian .",
    "we start with the form @xmath87 which is then transformed into impact parameter space giving , @xmath88 the slope of the gaussian , @xmath89 , is chosen so that it yields the same standard deviation in @xmath85 as our model .",
    "one danger in using a gaussian model is that it neglects the importance of interactions in peripheral regions .",
    "our model attempts to fix this problem by spreading out the distribution in @xmath1 .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ fig : compgauss ] that our model fall off more slowly with @xmath15 .",
    "now let us estimate the contribution of large values of @xmath85 to the total hadronic cross section .",
    "the total cross section follows from the optical theorem , @xmath90 we have made a numerical evaluation of the fraction of the total hadronic configuration - nucleon cross section obtained by setting different upper limits on the @xmath15-integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] , one can see that no more that about thirty percent of the total hadronic cross section is due to values of @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , contributions from large values of @xmath85 occur for hadronic sizes close to the pion size , @xmath20 fm .",
    "averaging over the photon wave function will lead to a suppression of contributions from larger size hadronic configurations , so there will indeed be a small contribution to the total dis cross section due to large values of @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ) .",
    "the goal of sect .",
    "[ sec : gamma ] will be to determine whether the contribution to the @xmath38 cross section from large values of @xmath85 is significant enough that we may expect to see black body behavior within hera kinematics .    to summarize , fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleg ] demonstrates that large values of @xmath85 are approached for hadronic configuration - nucleon scattering at central impact parameters , @xmath91 fm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleg ] it is seen that this is particularly true for hadronic sizes around @xmath92 fm .",
    "figure  [ fig : fraction ] shows that for @xmath93 fm , a maximum of about 1/3 of the total hadron - nucleon cross section comes from values of @xmath85 that approach the black limit",
    ". when @xmath94 fm , a very small fraction of the total hadronic configuration - nucleon cross section comes from large values of @xmath85 .",
    "the only contribution from @xmath84 to the total cross section for @xmath95 fm occurs at very small @xmath3 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "most of the model dependence in this calculation comes from uncertainty in the large-@xmath1 behavior of the amplitude .",
    "the different curves in fig .  [ fig : testmodel ] demonstrate how our model changes if we remove contributions from large @xmath1 .",
    "notice that simply removing the contribution from @xmath97 gev@xmath5 leads to an error of less than ten percent .",
    "thus , we do not expect our uncertainty in the large @xmath1 behavior to have a drastic effect .",
    "we should also remark that we have considered only the non - spin - flip interactions .",
    "corrections which account for the spin - flip amplitude would result in a smaller non - spin - flip amplitude than what we consider here .",
    "experimental results in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the polarization , @xmath98 , is less than @xmath99 for the range of @xmath1 we are discussing . from the formula relating @xmath98 to the spin - flip amplitude , @xmath100 we find the fraction , @xmath101 . here",
    ", @xmath102 represents the amplitude with no spin - flip whereas @xmath103 represents the amplitude with spin - flip .",

    "the total cross section has the approximate s - behavior of the @xmath110 cross section as in ref .",
    "@xcite , consistent with the behavior of a donnachie - landshoff soft pomeron  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "@xmath111 , and eq .  ( [ eq : disp ] ) gives @xmath112 .",
    "the second term in eq .",

    "( [ eq : disp ] ) , @xmath114 .",
    "the correction to the squared amplitude is therefore approximately ten percent near the forward direction .",
    "away from the forward direction , one must account for the small variation of @xmath105 with @xmath1 .",
    "the effect can be estimated by considering the signature factor in the general form of the reggeon amplitude .",
    "for @xmath115 gev@xmath10 , @xmath116 continues to contribute a negligible amount to the amplitude .",
    "the elastic cross section associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : imaginamp ] ) is found by integrating the profile function over impact parameters , @xmath117 the total cross section is found using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross ] ) .",

    "we neglect both effects in our model . as a consequence , when our model predicts that the bbl has been reached below a certain impact parameter , we can be confident that the same would be true in a model that incorporates inelastic diffraction and the effects of a real component of the amplitude .",
    "on the other hand , if our model predicts that the bbl has not been reached , we must keep in mind that corrections due to inelastic diffraction and a real part of the amplitude may be important .",
    "in other words , the bbl may already be approached at larger values of @xmath15 than what our model predicts .",
    "the uncertainty in the matching region is expressed by the uncertainty in the parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "however , values of the order of 4 to 10 seem to work well and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] , there is a variation of only about fifteen percent at small impact parameters when we vary @xmath29 from 10 to 4 .",
    "note that this is done for a hadronic size of @xmath125 fm which is in the region where the dependence upon @xmath29 should be at its greatest .",
    "however , there remains another subtlety related to the matching of kinematic regions .",
    "first , recall the distinction between the energy scale , @xmath4 , denoting the virtuality of the photon in a particular scattering process , and the scale , @xmath23 , which is the energy scale related to the hadronic size , @xmath16 , through the scaling ansatz of ref .  @xcite .",
    "these two scales are nearly equal as long as we consider hadronic sizes in the vicinity of the average hadronic size for @xmath31 . in determining which value of @xmath3 ( called @xmath27 in eq .",

    "the physical meaning of this effect is that the profile function for a small size configuration approaches the bbl more slowly if it is far off shell for a given @xmath4 .",
    "note that once we begin to calculate the total cross section , an external value for @xmath4 is explicit , and we no longer have this ambiguity .",

    "the suppression of the profile function due to the pomeron form factor , @xmath134 , does not occur until one considers larger hadronic configurations .",
    "therefore , for intermediate hadronic sizes , the profile function rapidly approaches the unitarity limit as @xmath3 decreases when @xmath64 is large .",

    "( [ eq : pb2 ] ) gives @xmath168 which is valid for @xmath162 fm .",

    "( [ eq : pb3 ] ) and the profile function calculated at @xmath170  @xcite    @xmath171    the profile function @xmath172 is calculated using the glauber multiple scattering formalism  @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the energy - dependent pion - nucleon total scattering cross section , @xmath175 mb , @xmath176 gev ; @xmath177 is the nuclear optical density normalized such that @xmath178 .",
    "@xmath179 is the number of nucleons in the target .",

    "the profile function for the nuclear target shows some similarity with the profile function for the proton target .",
    "the main differences are that the bbl is approached over a larger range of impact parameters than in the case of a proton target .",
    "this is not surprising because of the larger thickness of the nuclear target .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclearcase ] show the fraction of the hadronic cross section due to large values of @xmath186 .",
    "large leading twist gluon shadowing tames the growth of the interaction of hadronic components of the photon with the nucleus so that the unitarity constraint is satisfied for @xmath187 while the bbl may be reached for a large range of impact parameters .",
    "for smaller @xmath3 , unitarity starts to break down at central impact parameters . for large @xmath16 ,",
    "unitarity is automatically satisfied since the glauber model for large total cross sections leads to a @xmath186 that approaches unity .",
    "finally , we have included plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclearcase2 ] for the nuclear target showing the fraction of @xmath188 due to large values of @xmath186 analogous to those in fig .",

    "( note the recovery of leading twist behavior for the longitudinal cross section at large @xmath3 and @xmath190 gev@xmath10 . )",
    "notice also that the fraction of @xmath191 due to large values of @xmath186 for @xmath192 is actually larger in some cases than for the case , @xmath193 .",
    "this effect can be explained qualitatively by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : pb ] . for",
    "the case of the nuclear target , the main contributions to @xmath191 come from smaller values of @xmath16 ( @xmath194 fm ) .",
    "the growth of the profile function with decreasing @xmath3 at small @xmath16 is slower for smaller values of @xmath3 ( @xmath195 ) than for larger values .",
    "thus , the tail of profile function at large impact parameter may become significant in these regions .",
    "a general , well - known feature of @xmath38 and @xmath196 scattering is that the fraction of the interactions of hadronic components in the virtual photon wavefunction with the proton which take place at or near the bbl increases as @xmath3 and @xmath4 decrease as is exhibited explicitly in this paper in figs . [",
    "fig : dipoleg ] , [ fig : fraction ] and [ fig : totalfrac ] .",
    "we hope that one day we may be able to exploit the novel properties of interactions in the bbl to study a new phase of pqcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite the signatures of the bbl for dis were discussed with the hopes that they would be seen in future experiments .",
    "it remained to be determined , however , in which kinematical regions one can expect to see black body behavior .",
    "having now constructed a model of the amplitude for the interaction of the hadronic components of the virtual photon wavefunction , we are in a position to make rough estimates of the fraction of the hadronic interactions that exhibit the characteristic behavior of black body interactions .",
    "more precisely , since we know that the effects that we have ignored so far  inelastic diffraction and the real part of @xmath74 ,  will tend to increase the proximity of the interactions to the unitarity limit , then we can place lower limits on the values of @xmath3 and @xmath15 where a significant fraction of the events will occur at or near the bbl .",
    "our results show that , within available hera kinematics , a significant fraction of the total dis cross section is due to interactions of the hadronic components with the proton that occur near the bbl . in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : totalfrac ] shows that at @xmath197 gev@xmath10 and @xmath96 , about 1/5 of the longitudinal cross section is due to values of @xmath198 .",
    "the agreement of our model with preliminary hera data and with previous models helps to strengthen this conclusion .",
    "an improved model , with corrections for inelastic diffraction , will likely predict a more rapid approach to the bbl at small @xmath3 and central impact paramters .",
    "the approach to the bbl as @xmath3 and @xmath15 decrease occurs much more rapidly for the case of a heavy nuclear target than for the case of a proton target .",
    "this can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] and [ fig : nuclearcase ] . for example , at @xmath199 fm and @xmath200 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] shows that , for the proton , less than 1/2 of the total cross section is due to contributions from @xmath201 whereas with a @xmath8pb target , fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclearcase ] shows that over seventy percent of the total cross section is due to contributions from @xmath201 .",
    "this suggests that nuclear targets are ideal for studies of the bbl as a phase of qcd as has been discussed before in ref .",
    "future work on this subject should incorporate inelastic effects .",
    "also , a greater understanding of the large @xmath1 behavior would lead to greater accuracy in the model .",
