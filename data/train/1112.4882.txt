    "since the first papers about exotic smoothness it was folklore to state an influence of exotic smoothness on the state sum ( or path integral ) for quantum gravity . in our first paper @xcite we calculated the `` exotic smoothness '' contribution to the path integral for a special class of compact 4-manifolds including the k3 surface .",
    "the exotic smoothness structure was constructed by knot surgery .",
    "similar results were obtained by duston @xcite for branched covers .",
    "the calculation of the path integral has to formally include the exotic smoothness @xcite to relate it to smooth invariants of 4-manifolds .",
    "we demonstrated it in our previous paper ( to get the chern - simons invariant ) .",
    "unfortunately the most interesting and physically important case of an exotic @xmath0 is also the most complicated one which strongly relies on infinite constructions ( casson handles etc . ) .",
    "the appearance of two classes of exotic @xmath0 , large and small , complicates the situation .",
    "these two classes have their origin in the two main failures in 4-dimensional differential topology which stays in contrast to the topological theory : the smooth h - cobordism theorem and the large class of non - smoothable , topological 4-manifolds .",
    "if there is a smooth embedding of a 3-sphere into the exotic @xmath0 then one calls it a _ small _ exotic @xmath0 and if not it is a _ large _ exotic @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we will study the effect of the exotic @xmath0 on the functional integral for the einstein - hilbert action .    in the next section we present some of the physical assumptions as well the definition of an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "then we discuss the existence of a lorentz metric for an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "formally the existence of a lorentz metric is a purely topological question which can be answered positively . on the other hand , global hyperbolicity and all its consequences depend on the standard smoothness of @xmath1 ( as smooth product ) .",
    "therefore an exotic @xmath0 must contain naked singularities .",
    "we will further analyze these singularities in section [ sec : naked - singularities ] to obtain a pairwise structure by the failure of the whitney s trick .",
    "the main part of this paper is formed by the sections [ sec : exotic - r4 ] to [ sec : the - functional - integral ] .",
    "it starts with a description of large and small exotic @xmath0 .",
    "then we discuss the splitting of the action functional ( using the diffeomorphism invariance of the einstein - hilbert action ) according to these descriptions .",
    "finally we calculate the functional integral at first for a particular exotic @xmath0 and then for the whole continuous ( radial ) family .",
    "the discussion of observables , like volume and the wilson loop , in section [ sec : observables ] completes the picture .",
    "especially we confirm the results of loop quantum gravity , i.e. the quantization of area and volume .",
    "all exotic @xmath0 have one common property : the appearance of a cosmological constant .",
    "einsteins insight that gravity is the manifestation of geometry leads to a new view on the structure of spacetime . from the mathematical point of view , spacetime is a smooth 4-manifold endowed with a ( smooth ) metric as basic variable for general relativity .",
    "later on , the existence question for lorentz structure and causality problems ( see @xcite ) gave further restrictions on the 4-manifold : causality implies non - compactness , lorentz structure needs a codimension-1 foliation .",
    "usually , one starts with a globally foliated , non - compact 4-manifold @xmath2 fulfilling all restrictions where @xmath3 is a smooth 3-manifold representing the spatial part .",
    "but other non - compact 4-manifolds are also possible , i.e. it is enough to assume a non - compact , smooth 4-manifold endowed with a codimension-1 foliation .",
    "all these restrictions on the representation of spacetime by the manifold concept are clearly motivated by physical questions . among the properties",
    "there is one distinguished element : the smoothness .",
    "usually one assumes a smooth , unique atlas of charts covering the manifold where the smoothness is induced by the unique smooth structure on @xmath4 .",
    "but as discussed in the introduction , that is not the full story . even in dimension 4 , there are an infinity of possible other smoothness structures ( i.e. a smooth atlas ) non - diffeomorphic to each other . in the following",
    "we will specialize to the @xmath0 :    the smoothness structure of @xmath0 is called an * exotic smoothness structure * or * exotic @xmath0 * if it is non - diffeomorphic to the standard smoothness structure ( induced from the smooth product @xmath5 ) .",
    "the implications for physics seem to be obvious because we rely on the smooth calculus to formulate equations of any field theory .",
    "thus different smoothness structures could represent different physical situations leading to different measurable results .",
    "but it should be stressed that _",
    "exotic smoothness is not exotic physics ! _ exotic smoothness is a mathematical possibility which should be further explored to understand its physical relevance .",
    "before we start with the construction of the various exotic @xmath0 s ( large and small ) , we will discuss some physical implications which are independent of these constructions .",
    "firstly we consider the existence of a lorentz metric , i.e. a 4-manifold @xmath6 ( the spacetime ) admits a lorentz metric if ( and only if ) there is a non - vanishing vector field . in case of a compact 4-manifold @xmath6 we can use the poincare - hopf theorem to state : a compact 4-manifold admits a lorentz metric if the euler characteristic vanishes @xmath7 .",
    "but in a compact 4-manifold there are closed time - like curves ( ctc ) contradicting the causality or more exactly : the chronology violating set of a compact 4-manifold is non - empty ( proposition 6.4.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "non - compact 4-manifold @xmath6 admits always a lorentz metric and a special class of these 4-manifolds have an empty chronology violating set .",
    "if @xmath8 is an acausal hypersurface in @xmath6 ( i.e. , a topological hypersurface of @xmath6 such that no pair of points of @xmath6 can be connected by means of a causal curve ) , then @xmath9 is the future cauchy development ( or domain of dependence ) of @xmath8 , i.e. the set of all points @xmath10 of @xmath6 such that any past - inextensible causal curve through @xmath10 intersects @xmath8 .",
    "similarly @xmath11 is the past cauchy development of @xmath8 .",
    "if there are no closed causal curves , then @xmath8 is a cauchy surface if @xmath12 .",
    "but then @xmath6 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the existence of a cauchy surface implies global hyperbolicity , i.e. a spacetime manifold @xmath6 without boundary is said to be globally hyperbolic if the following two conditions hold :    1 .   _",
    "absence of naked singularities _",
    ": for every pair of points @xmath10 and @xmath14 in @xmath6 , the space of all points that can be both reached from @xmath10 along a past - oriented causal curve and reached from @xmath14 along a future - oriented causal curve is compact .",
    "2 .   _ chronology _ : no closed causal curves exist ( or  causality  holds on @xmath6 ) .",
    "usually condition 2 above is replaced by the more technical condition ",
    "strong causality holds on @xmath6  but as shown in @xcite instead of  strong causality  , one can write simply the condition  causality  ( and strong causality will hold under causality plus condition 1 above )",
    ".    then all ( non - compact ) 4-manifolds @xmath13 are the only 4-manifolds which admit a globally hyperbolic lorentz metric , where the product @xmath15 has to be a smooth product not only by physical reasons but also because of the claimed result in @xcite .",
    "but more is true @xcite ,    [ thm : global - hyp ]    if a spacetime @xmath16 is globally hyperbolic , then it is isometric to @xmath17 with a smooth positive function @xmath18 and a smooth family of riemannian metrics @xmath19 on @xmath8 varying with @xmath20 . moreover , each @xmath21 is a cauchy slice .",
    "furthermore in @xcite it was shown :    * if a compact spacelike submanifold with boundary of a globally hyperbolic spacetime is acausal then it can be extended to a full cauchy spacelike hypersurface @xmath8 of @xmath6 , and * for any cauchy spacelike hypersurface @xmath8 there exists a function as in th .",
    "[ thm : global - hyp ] such that @xmath8 is one of the levels @xmath22 .",
    "so , what about exotic 4-manifolds ? at first the existence of the lorentz",
    "metric is a purely topological condition which will be fulfilled by all non - compact 4-manifolds independent of the smoothness structure . by considering the global hyperbolicity , the picture changes .",
    "an exotic spacetime homeomorphic to @xmath13 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "the cauchy surface @xmath8 is a 3-manifold with unique smoothness structure ( up to diffeomorphisms ) , the standard structure .",
    "so , the smooth product @xmath13 has also the standard smoothness structure .",
    "but the diffeomorphism to @xmath13 is necessary for global hyperbolicity",
    ". therefore an _",
    "exotic @xmath13 is never globally hyperbolic but admits a lorentz metric_. generally we have an exotic @xmath13 with a lorentz metric such that the projection @xmath23 is a time - function ( that is , a ontinuous function which is strictly increasing on future directed causal curves ) .",
    "but then the exotic @xmath13 has no closed causal curves and must contain naked singularities admits stably causal metrics ( that is , those with a time function ) .",
    "so , if @xmath6 is not diffeomorphic to some product@xmath13 , all these ( causally well behaved ) metrics must contain naked singularities .",
    "we thank m. snchez for the explanation of this result . ] .",
    "we will later see the source of these singularities .",
    "in this section we will give some information about the construction of exotic @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of a smooth embedding @xmath24 in the exotic @xmath0 splits all exotic @xmath0 into two classes , large ( no embedding ) or small .      at first",
    "we start with some definitions from knot theory .",
    "a ( smooth ) knot @xmath25 is a smooth embedding @xmath26 . in the following we assume every knot to be smooth .",
    "secondly we exclude wilderness of knots , i.e the knot is equivalent to a polygon in @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( tame knot ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath29-disk is denoted by @xmath30 with @xmath31 .    * smoothly slice knot * : a knot in @xmath32 is smoothly slice if there exists a two - disk @xmath33 smoothly embedded in @xmath34 such that the image of @xmath35 is @xmath25 .",
    "an example of a slice knot is the so - called stevedore s knot ( in rolfson notation @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stevedore - knot-6_1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : stevedore - knot-6_1 ] ]    * flat topological embedding * : let @xmath37 be a topological manifold of dimension @xmath29 and @xmath38 a topological manifold of dimension @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "a topological embedding @xmath41 is flat if it extends to a topological embedding @xmath42 .",
    "* topologically slice knot * : a knot @xmath25 in @xmath43 is topologically slice if there exists a two - disk @xmath33 flatly topologically embedded in @xmath34 such that the image of @xmath44 is @xmath25 .",
    "here we remark that the flatness condition is essential .",
    "any knot @xmath45 is the boundary of a disc @xmath33 embedded in @xmath34 , which can be seen by taking the cone over the knot .",
    "but the vertex of the cone is a non - flat point ( the knot is crashed to a point ) .",
    "the difference between the smooth and the flat topological embedding is the key for the following discussion .",
    "this innocent looking difference seem to imply that both definitions are equivalent .",
    "but deep results from 4-manifold topology gave a negative answer : there are topologically slice knots which are not smoothly slice .",
    "an example is the pretzel knot @xmath46 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pretzel - knot-3 - 5 - 7 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : pretzel - knot-3 - 5 - 7 ] ]    in @xcite , freedman gave a topological criteria for topological sliceness : the alexander polynomial @xmath47 ( the best known knot invariant , see @xcite ) of the knot @xmath25 has to be one , @xmath48 .",
    "an example how to measure the smooth sliceness is given by the smooth 4-genus @xmath49 of the knot @xmath25 , i.e. the minimal genus of a surface @xmath50 smoothly embedded in @xmath34 with boundary @xmath51 the knot .",
    "this surface @xmath50 is called the _",
    "seifert surface_. therefore , if the smooth 4-genus vanishes @xmath52 then the knot @xmath25 bounds a 2-disk @xmath33 ( surface of genus @xmath53 ) given by the smooth embedding @xmath54 so that the image of @xmath55 is the knot @xmath25 .",
    "large exotic @xmath0 can be constructed by using the failure to arbitrarily split of a compact , simple - connected 4-manifold . for every topological 4-manifold one",
    "knows how to split this manifold _ topologically _ into simpler pieces using the work of freedman @xcite .",
    "but as shown by donaldson @xcite , some of these 4-manifolds do not exist as smooth 4-manifolds .",
    "this contradiction between the continuous and the smooth case produces the first examples of exotic @xmath0@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the construction method is rather indirect and therefore useless for the calculation of the path integral contribution of the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "but as pointed out by gompf ( see @xcite or @xcite exercise 9.4.23 on p. 377ff and its solution on p. 522ff ) , large exotic @xmath0 can be also constructed by using smoothly non - slice but topologically slice knots . especially one obtains an explicit construction which will be used in the calculations later .",
    "let @xmath25 be a knot in @xmath43 and @xmath56 the two - handlebody obtained by attaching a two - handle to @xmath34 along @xmath25 with framing @xmath53 .",
    "that means : one has a two - handle @xmath57 which is glued to the 0-handle @xmath34 along its boundary using a map @xmath58 so that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 ( or the image @xmath61 is the solid knotted torus ) .",
    "let @xmath62 be a flat topological embedding ( @xmath25 is topologically slice ) . for @xmath25 a smoothly non - slice knot ,",
    "the open 4-manifold@xmath63 where @xmath64 is the interior of @xmath65 , is homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic to @xmath0 with the standard smoothness structure ( both pieces are glued along the common boundary @xmath66 ) .",
    "the proof of this fact ( @xmath67 is exotic ) is given by contradiction , i.e. let us assume @xmath67 is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath68 .",
    "the restriction of this diffeomorphism to @xmath56 is a smooth embedding @xmath69 .",
    "however , such a smooth embedding exists if and only if @xmath25 is smoothly slice ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but , by hypothesis , @xmath25 is not smoothly slice .",
    "thus by contradiction , there exists a no diffeomorphism @xmath68 and @xmath67 is exotic , homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we have to prove that @xmath67 is large .",
    "@xmath56 , by construction , is compact and a smooth submanifold of @xmath67 . by hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath25 is not smoothly slice and therefore @xmath56 can not smoothly embed in @xmath0 . by restriction , @xmath70 and also @xmath32 can not smoothly embed and therefore @xmath67 is a large exotic @xmath0 .",
    "small exotic @xmath0 s are again the result of anomalous smoothness in 4-dimensional topology but of a different kind than for large exotic @xmath0 s . in 4-manifold topology @xcite , a homotopy - equivalence between two compact , closed , simply - connected 4-manifolds implies a homeomorphism between them ( a so - called h cobordism ) .",
    "but donaldson @xcite provided the first smooth counterexample , i.e. both manifolds are generally not diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "the failure can be localized in some contractible submanifold ( akbulut cork ) so that an open neighborhood of this submanifold is a small exotic @xmath0 .",
    "the whole procedure implies that this exotic @xmath0 can be embedded in the 4-sphere @xmath71 .    the idea of the construction is simply given by the fact that every such smooth h - cobordism between non - diffeomorphic 4-manifolds can be written as a product cobordism except for a compact contractible sub - h - cobordism @xmath72 , the akbulut cork .",
    "an open subset @xmath73 homeomorphic to @xmath74\\times{{\\mathbb{r}}^{4}}$ ] is the corresponding sub - h - cobordism between two exotic @xmath75 s .",
    "these exotic @xmath75 s are called ribbon @xmath75 s .",
    "they have the important property of being diffeomorphic to open subsets of the standard @xmath75 . to be more precise , consider a pair @xmath76 of homeomorphic , smooth , closed , simply - connected 4-manifolds .",
    "_ _ let @xmath77 be a smooth h - cobordism between closed , simply connected 4-manifolds @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "then there is an open subset @xmath80 homeomorphic to @xmath74\\times{{\\mathbb{r}}^{4}}$ ] with a compact subset @xmath81 such that the pair @xmath82 is diffeomorphic to a product @xmath74\\times(x_{-}\\setminus c , u\\cap x_{-}\\setminus c)$ ] .",
    "the subsets @xmath83 ( homeomorphic to @xmath75 ) are diffeomorphic to open subsets of @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not diffeomorphic , then there is no smooth 4-ball in @xmath84 containing the compact set @xmath85 , so both @xmath84 are exotic @xmath75 s . _ _",
    "thus , remove a certain contractible , smooth , compact 4-manifold @xmath86 ( called an akbulut cork ) from @xmath78 , and re - glue it by an involution of @xmath87 , i.e. a diffeomorphism @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
    "this argument was modified above so that it works for a contractible _ open _ subset @xmath92 with similar properties , such that @xmath93 will be an exotic @xmath75 if @xmath79 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore @xmath93 lies in a compact set , i.e. a 4-sphere or @xmath93 is a small exotic @xmath0 . in the next subsection",
    "we will see how this results in the construction of handlebodies of exotic @xmath75 . in @xcite freedman and demichelis",
    "constructed also a continuous family of small exotic @xmath0 .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the decomposition of a small exotic @xmath0 by bizaca and gompf @xcite by using special pieces , the handles forming a handle body .",
    "every 4-manifold can be decomposed ( seen as handle body ) using standard pieces such as @xmath94 , the so - called @xmath95-handle attached along @xmath96 to the boundary @xmath97 of a @xmath98handle @xmath99 .",
    "the construction of the handle body can be divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is known as the akbulut cork , a contractable 4-manifold with boundary a homology 3-sphere ( a 3-manifold with the same homology as the 3-sphere ) .",
    "the akbulut cork @xmath100 is given by a linking between a 1-handle and a 2-handle of framing @xmath53 . the second part is the casson handle @xmath101 which will be considered now .",
    "let us start with the basic construction of the casson handle @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a smooth , compact , simple - connected 4-manifold and @xmath102 a ( codimension-2 ) mapping . by using diffeomorphisms of @xmath33 and @xmath6",
    ", one can deform the mapping @xmath103 to get an immersion ( i.e. injective differential ) generically with only double points ( i.e. @xmath104 ) as singularities @xcite .",
    "but to incorporate the generic location of the disk , one is rather interesting in the mapping of a 2-handle @xmath57 induced by @xmath105 from @xmath103 .",
    "then every double point ( or self - intersection ) of @xmath106 leads to self - plumbings of the 2-handle @xmath57 .",
    "a self - plumbing is an identification of @xmath107 with @xmath108 where @xmath109 are disjoint sub - disks of the first factor disk or @xmath110 creating either a positive or negative ( respectively ) double point on the disk @xmath111 ( the core ) . ] . consider the pair @xmath112 and produce finitely many self - plumbings away from the attaching region @xmath113 to get a kinky handle @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the attaching region of the kinky handle .",
    "a kinky handle @xmath114 is a one - stage tower @xmath116 and an @xmath117-stage tower @xmath118 is an @xmath29-stage tower union kinky handles @xmath119 where two towers are attached along @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be @xmath122 and the casson handle @xmath123 is the union of towers ( with direct limit topology induced from the inclusions @xmath124 ) .",
    "the main idea of the construction above is very simple : an immersed disk ( disk with self - intersections ) can be deformed into an embedded disk ( disk without self - intersections ) by sliding one part of the disk along another ( embedded ) disk to kill the self - intersections .",
    "unfortunately the other disk can be immersed only .",
    "but the immersion can be deformed to an embedding by a disk again etc . in the limit of this process one ",
    "shifts the self - intersections into infinity  and obtains the standard open 2-handle @xmath125 .",
    "a casson handle is specified up to ( orientation preserving ) diffeomorphism ( of pairs ) by a labeled finitely - branching tree with base - point * , having all edge paths infinitely extendable away from * .",
    "each edge should be given a label @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "here is the construction : tree @xmath128 .",
    "each vertex corresponds to a kinky handle ; the self - plumbing number of that kinky handle equals the number of branches leaving the vertex .",
    "the sign on each branch corresponds to the sign of the associated self plumbing .",
    "the whole process generates a tree with infinite many levels . in principle",
    ", every tree with a finite number of branches per level realizes a corresponding casson handle .",
    "each building block of a casson handle , the `` kinky '' handle with @xmath29 kinks , is diffeomorphic to the @xmath129times boundary - connected sum @xmath130 ( see appendix [ sec : connected - and - boundary - connected ] ) with two attaching regions . technically speaking",
    ", one region is a tubular neighborhood of band sums of whitehead links connected with the previous block .",
    "the other region is a disjoint union of the standard open subsets @xmath131 in @xmath132 ( this is connected with the next block ) .",
    "in this section we will discuss the einstein - hilbert action functional @xmath133 of the 4-manifold @xmath6 and fix the ricci - flat metric @xmath134 as solution of the vacuum field equations of the exotic 4-manifold .",
    "the main part of our argumentation is additional contribution to the action functional coming from exotic smoothness .      in case of the large exotic @xmath0",
    ", we consider the decompositions@xmath135 leading to a sum in the action @xmath136 because of diffeomorphism invariance of the einstein - hilbert action , this decomposition do not depend on the concrete realization with respect to any coordinate system .",
    "therefore we obtain the relation@xmath137 and get a similar relation using ( [ eq : relation - exotic ] ) between the action @xmath138 of the standard @xmath0 and the action @xmath139 of the large exotic @xmath0@xmath140 the knot is topologically slice ( @xmath141 is a flat topological embedding ) .",
    "therefore the restriction of @xmath141 to the 2-handle @xmath57 in @xmath56 is a topological embedding defining an embedding @xmath142 with @xmath143 . from the topological point of view",
    ", the seifert surface of @xmath25 is the disc @xmath33 with genus @xmath53 .",
    "then we obtain using @xmath144@xmath145 assuming the flatness of the @xmath98handle @xmath34 .",
    "the product metric ( block diagonal metric ) @xmath146 on the image @xmath147 of the 2-handle with @xmath148 induces@xmath149 with the curvature scalars @xmath150 .",
    "the 2-dimensional integrals@xmath151 are by definition the euler characteristics @xmath152 using the topologically sliceness of the knot @xmath153 .",
    "finally we obtain@xmath154 now we consider the other action @xmath155 where we use a non - flat embedding @xmath69 .",
    "remember the knot @xmath25 is smoothly not slice .",
    "but then we can only choose the embedding so that the minimal genus @xmath49 of the seifert surface @xmath50 is non - zero , i.e. one obtains for the euler characteristics@xmath156 this genus @xmath49 is an invariant of the knot also known as smooth 4-genus .",
    "importantly the seifert surface @xmath50 has negative curvature for @xmath157 .",
    "a similar argumentation leads to the result@xmath158 and finally we have the relation using ( [ eq : action - relation-1 ] ) and the results above@xmath159 as the correction to the action @xmath139 of the large exotic @xmath0 .",
    "the two surfaces @xmath50 and @xmath160 have the same boundary ( the knot @xmath25 ) and differ only by the embedding .",
    "so , it seems natural to assume the same volume , i.e. @xmath161 .",
    "finally we will write this relation in the usual units@xmath162 this expression looks very simple but the complication is located at the 4-genus @xmath49 .",
    "currently there is no simple expression for the calculation .",
    "all results show only the existence @xmath163 but never calculate the value .",
    "so , we are not satisfied with the expression above .",
    "we would expect that @xmath49 is related to the map @xmath141 which is certainly related to infinite constructions like the casson handle .",
    "if this speculation is correct then one can interpret the expression above as a non - perturbative calculation .",
    "as explained above , a small exotic @xmath0 can be decomposed into a compact subset @xmath100 ( akbulut cork ) and a casson handle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "especially this exotic @xmath0 depends strongly on the casson handle , i.e. non - diffeomorphic casson handles lead to non - diffeomorphic @xmath0 s .",
    "thus we have to understand the analytical properties of a casson handle . in @xcite ,",
    "the analytical properties of the casson handle were discussed .",
    "the main idea is the usage of the theory of end - periodic manifolds , i.e. an infinite periodic structure generated by @xmath77 glued along a compact set @xmath100 to get for the interior @xmath164 the end - periodic manifold .",
    "the definition of an end - periodic manifold is very formal ( see @xcite ) and we omit it here . all casson handles generated by a balanced tree have the structure of end - periodic manifolds as shown in @xcite . by using the theory of taubes @xcite",
    "one can construct a metric on @xmath165 by using the metric on @xmath77 .",
    "then a metric @xmath134 in @xmath166 transforms to a periodic function @xmath167 on the infinite periodic manifold@xmath168 where @xmath169 is the building block @xmath77 at the @xmath170th place .",
    "then the action of @xmath166 can be divided into two parts@xmath171 and we start with the discussion of the compact part @xmath100 . this part @xmath100 is formally given by a so - called plumbing of two spheres @xmath172 with trivial normal bundles having the algebraic intersection number @xmath173 but an extra pair of intersections ( with numbers @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) .",
