    "the classical linear stability theory of viscous incompressible flows is concerned with the development in space and time of infinitesimal perturbations around a given basic flow .",
    "then small disturbances are resolved into normal modes which , for a steady - state basic flow , depend on time exponentially with a complex exponent @xmath0 . for parallel shear basic flows , further separation of variables in the governing stability equations",
    "leads to a set of ordinary differential equations which , with taking recourse to squire s theorem and considering only 2-d disturbances , reduces to the orr - sommerfeld equation .",
    "when this equation is solved with proper boundary conditions , the problem of linear stability of parallel flows is reduced to a 2-point boundary ( eigen ) value problem .",
    "for nonparallel basic flows , when the equations for disturbance flow are dependent not only on the normal coordinate , the corresponding operator does not separate unless certain terms are ignored .",
    "the approximation , that neglects the nonparallel terms and relates the stability characteristics to those of the equivalent parallel flow . has been extensively used for the boundary layer type flows to retain the great advantage of reducing the disturbance equations to ordinary differential equations ( see , e.g. , reed and saric , 1996 ) .",
    "a number of weakly nonparallel theories , which seek to account for the affects of the flow divergence through equations that include higher - order terms than those in the orr - sommerfeld equation , have been developed ( see reviews in reed and saric , 1996 ; herbert 1997 ; saric et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning , in this context , the works on stability of conical flows by shtern and hussain ( 1998 ) , shtern and drazin ( 2000 ) where an exact transformation , reducing the stability problem to an ordinary differential equation despite the non - parallelism of the basic flow , is found .",
    "however , the advantage of such a transformation in the analysis is limited to the particular class of steady perturbation modes . in shtern and hussain ( 2003 )",
    ", the approach of shtern and hussain ( 1998 ) has been applied to the time - oscillatory disturbances by using a far - field approximation in the equations for the disturbances .",
    "several methods have been designed for numerical solution of the nonparallel flow stability problems . in the context of boundary - layer type flows ,",
    "the most successful effort to - date is the parabolic - stability - equation ( pse ) approach , introduced and recently reviewed by herbert ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , the pse based numerical studies are not able to accommodate the upstream propagation of disturbances . the global linear stability analysis",
    "( see review by theofilis 2003 ) was developed for analyzing stability of the two - dimensional flows .",
    "the nonparallel stability effects have been also investigated on the basis of direct numerical simulations of the linearized navier - stokes equations ( e.g. , davies and carpentier 2003 ) or the complete navier - stokes equations ( e.g. , fazel and konzelmann 1990 )",
    ". such numerical simulations are not equivalent to a stability analysis , and , in fact , have more in common with physical experiments than stability theory .",
    "the numerical methods suffer from the problem of boundary conditions on the open , inflow and outflow , boundaries which ( especially outflow boundary conditions ) can lead to spiritus effects , even when carefully implemented .",
    "if the basic flow is non - steady , this brings about great difficulties in theoretical studies of the instability since the method of normal modes in its traditional form , with the modes depending on time as @xmath1 , is not applicable at all .",
    "( some success has been achieved in studying stability of the time - periodic basic states when floquet theory can be applied - see drazin and reid 1981 . )",
    "if an unsteady flow is non - parallel , it should further complicate matters . as a matter of fact , there are no examples of the linear stability problem for viscous incompressible flows developing both in space and time which is exactly solvable via separation of variables .",
    "recently , the so - called direct approach to separation of variables in linear pdes has been developed by a proper formalizing the features of the notion of separation of variables ( see , e.g. , zhdanov and zhalij 1999a , 1999b ) . in this approach",
    ", a form of the anstz for a solution with separated variables in a new coordinate system as well as a form of reduced odes , that should be obtained as a result of the variable separation , are postulated from the beginning .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to several equations of mathematical physics ( see , e.g. , zhalij , 1999 ; zhdanov and zhalij , 1999a , 1999b ; zhalij , 2002 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply this approach to the linear stability equations which govern the disturbance behavior in viscous incompressible fluid flows .",
    "the calculations are made for the linear stability equations written in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the new coordinate systems and the forms of basic flows , which permit the postulated form of separation of variables in the equations for disturbances , are determined as the result of application of the method .",
    "then the basic flows are specified by the requirement that they exactly satisfy the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a description of the method , as applied to the problem of linear stability of a three - dimensional unsteady basic flow with respect to the three - dimensional unsteady perturbations , and present the results .",
    "an example of application of the method to the linear stability equations with a restriction to the two - dimensional perturbations is also presented . in section iii , we discuss the fluid dynamics interpretation of some basic flows , defined in section ii as the exact solutions of the navier - stokes equations possessing exactly solvable stability problems , and formulate the corresponding two - point boundary value problems of ordinary differential equations . concluding remarks on the results obtained are furnished in section iv .",
    "we formulate the linear stability problem based on the navier - stokes equations written in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath2 ) . as usual in stability analysis , we split the velocity and pressure fields @xmath3 into two problems : the basic flow problem @xmath4 and a perturbation one @xmath5 , @xmath6 introducing ( [ stab1 ] ) into the navier - stokes equation written in terms of the variables @xmath3 and neglecting all terms that involve the square of the perturbation amplitude while imposing the requirement that the basic flow variables @xmath7 themselves satisfy the navier - stokes equations , one arrives at the following set of linear stability equations in cylindrical coordinates :    @xmath8    let us introduce a new coordinate system @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we will say that the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) is _ separable in the non - stationary cylindrical coordinate system _",
    "@xmath13 if the separation anstz , @xmath14 reduces the system of pdes ( [ 1.1 ] ) to a system of three second - order and one first order ordinary differential equations for four functions @xmath15 of the following form @xmath16 here @xmath17 are second order polynomials with respect to spectral parameters @xmath18 with coefficients , which are some smooth functions on @xmath19 .",
    "note , that equations ( [ 2.1])-([2.2 ] ) form the input data of the method .",
    "we can change these conditions and thereby modify the definition of separation of variables .",
    "for instance , we can change the order of the reduced equations ( [ 2.2 ] ) or the number of essential parameters @xmath18 .",
    "so , our claim of obtaining the _ complete description _ of basic flows and non - stationary coordinate systems providing separation of variables in ( [ 1.1 ] ) makes sense only within the framework of the given definition . if one uses a more general definition , it might be possible to construct new coordinate systems and basic flows providing separability of the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the principal steps of the procedure of variable separation in the system ( [ 1.1 ] ) are as follows .    1",
    ".   we insert the anstz ( [ 2.1 ] ) into equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) and express the derivatives @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , in terms of functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 using equations ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "we regard @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 as the new independent variables . + as the functions @xmath30 , basic flows @xmath31 and coefficients of the polynomials @xmath17 ( which are some smooth functions on @xmath19 ) are independent on these variables , we can demand that the obtained equality is transformed into identity under arbitrary @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , we should split the equality with respect to these variables . after splitting we",
    "get an overdetermined system of nonlinear partial differential equations for unknown functions @xmath32 , basic flows @xmath31 and coefficients of the polynomials @xmath17 .",
    "3 .   after solving the above system we get an exhaustive description of coordinate systems providing separability of equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) according to our definition .    thus ,",
    "the problem of variable separation in equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) reduces to integrating the overdetermined system of pdes for unknown functions @xmath32 , basic flows @xmath31 and coefficients of the polynomials @xmath17 .",
    "this have been done with the aid of _ mathematica _ package .",
    "we will consider the stability problems with separated variables for the basic flows specified by the requirement that they exactly satisfy the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the forms of the perturbations @xmath33 and @xmath34 are : @xmath35 where @xmath36    two classes of basic flows satisfying the navier - stokes equations are found as the result of the analysis .",

    "the equations with separated variables can be written for both classes in the forms @xmath48      the stability properties of a given flow may be tested by considering perturbations of specific structures .",
    "for example , the problem may be restricted to the two - dimensional perturbations even though an analog of the squire theorem can not be proved ( see , e.g. , griffond and casalis 2001 , joslin 1996 ) , or the perturbation flow field may be taken to have the same general form as the basic state ( duck and dry 2001 ) .",
    "although the stability analysis restricted to perturbations of specific forms is not complete , it enables one to show that the flow is susceptible to a special kind of instability . to demonstrate that a specification of the disturbance field may lead to new possibilities we consider the results of application of the direct method to the linear stability equations with a restriction to the two - dimensional perturbations with @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 not dependent on @xmath52 .",
    "the separability analysis leads to the perturbations of the form @xmath53 which is a particular case of ( [ pertform ] ) for @xmath54 .",
