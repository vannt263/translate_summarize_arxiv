    "baados , silk and west  @xcite discovered that the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy can be arbitrarily high if two particles which begin at rest at infinity collide near the horizon of a maximally rotating kerr black hole  @xcite and if the angular momentum of either particle is fine - tuned to the critical value .",
    "they argue this scenario in the context of the collision of dark matter particles around intermediate - mass black holes .",

    "the scenario by baados , silk and west  @xcite was subsequently criticized by several authors  @xcite .",

    "the validity of the test particle approximation is now under investigation .",
    "however , as we can see for the exact analysis of the analogous system  @xcite , it is quite reasonable that the physical cm energy outside the horizon is bounded from above due to the violation of the test particle approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also reasonable that the upper limit on the cm energy is still considerably high in the situation where the test particle approximation is good .    to circumvent the fine - tuning problem of the angular momentum , harada and",
    "kimura  @xcite proposed a scenario , where the fine - tuning is naturally realized by the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around a kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "they discovered that the cm energy for the collision between an isco particle and another generic particle becomes arbitrarily high in the limit of the maximal rotation of the black hole .",
    "even for the nonmaximally rotating black holes , grib and pavlov  @xcite proposed a different scenario to obtain the arbitrarily high cm energy of two colliding particles . in this case , the particle with a near - critical angular momentum can not reach the horizon from well outside through the geodesic motion because of the potential barrier . in their scenario ,",
    "the angular momentum of the particle must be fine - tuned to the critical value through the preceding scattering near the horizon .    the geometry of a vacuum , stationary and asymptotically flat black hole is uniquely given by the kerr metric  @xcite . in the background of the kerr spacetime , the expressions for the cm energy and its near - horizon limit are given for two colliding geodesic particles of the same rest mass , different energies and angular momenta in  @xcite and of different masses , energies and angular momenta in  @xcite , although both are restricted to the motion on the equatorial plane .",
    "it is quite important to extend the analysis to general geodesic particles not only because the analysis applies to realistic collisions in astrophysics but also because we can get a deeper physical insight into the phenomenon itself .",

    ", we adopt the test particle approximation and hence neglect the effects of self - gravity and back reaction .",
    "we then obtain an explicit expression for the cm energy of two colliding general geodesic particles at any spacetime point in the kerr spacetime and derive a formula for the cm energy of two general geodesic particles colliding near the horizon of a kerr black hole in terms of the conserved quantities of each particle and the polar angle .",
    "we show that the collision with an arbitrarily high cm energy is possible only in the limit to the horizon .",
    "we present the necessary and sufficient condition to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy and find that this condition is met only through the three scenarios , the direct collision scenario proposed by baados , silk and west  @xcite , the lso ( isco ) collision scenario by harada and kimura  @xcite and the multiple scattering scenario by grib and pavlov  @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , such collisions occur on the belt colored with blue ( shaded darkly ) between latitudes @xmath217 if we only allow bound and marginally bound massive critical particles . on the uncolored ( unshaded ) region ,",
    "the collision with an arbitrarily high cm energy is prohibited.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      baados , silk and west  @xcite originally proposed a scenario where a massive particle which is at rest at infinity , i.e. @xmath218 , with a near - critical angular momentum @xmath219 falls towards an extremal kerr black hole on the equatorial plane and collides with another particle near the horizon with an arbitrarily high cm energy in the limit @xmath220 .",
    "first , we only relax the restriction of the equatorial motion in their scenario and see whether the cm energy can still be arbitrarily high . in the original scenario by baados , silk and west  @xcite , it is important that the geodesic motion from infinity to the horizon is allowed .",
    "this means that the function @xmath221 must be positive for @xmath222 , with which we have not been concerned in secs .",
    "[ subsec : classification ] and [ subsec : belt ] . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_critical_extremal ] ) with @xmath218 , this is the case if and only if @xmath223 .",
    "then , marginally bound particles with a near - critical angular momentum @xmath173 for a sufficiently small @xmath174 can approach the horizon from infinity and collide with another particle near the horizon . actually , the condition @xmath223 is identical to that for the marginally bound critical particle @xmath218 obtained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : belt ] and hence we obtain @xmath199 thus , we can extend the original scenario by baados , silk and west  @xcite from the equator up to the latitude @xmath224 .",
    "moreover , we can also extend the analysis to include both marginally bound and unbound particles .",
    "also in this case , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_critical_extremal ] ) , the geodesic motion of the critical particle from infinity to the horizon is allowed if and only if @xmath183 and @xmath225 .",
    "in other words , the condition obtained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : belt ] also applies to the direct collision from infinity for both marginally bound and unbound particles .",
    "so the upper limit on the latitude for an arbitrarily high cm energy rises up to @xmath6 as the energy of the particle is increased to infinity .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fg : high - velocity_collision_belt ] still applies if the original scenario by baados , silk and west  @xcite is generalized to nonequatorial motion .",
    "we have proven that the consideration of the global behavior does not change the condition for an arbitrarily high cm energy for the marginally bound and unbound critical particles in the kerr black hole .",
    "however , it will not necessarily be true in more general black hole spacetimes .",
    "we have presented an expression for the cm energy of two general geodesic particles around a kerr black hole .",
    "this is the generalization of the formula obtained in the previous paper  @xcite of the present authors , where the analysis was restricted to two massive geodesic particles of the same rest mass moving on the equatorial plane . applying this general expression",
    ", we have shown that an unboundedly high cm energy can be realized only in the limit to the horizon and derived a formula for the cm energy for the near - horizon collision of two general geodesic particles .",
    "then , we have written down the necessary and sufficient condition for an unboundedly high cm energy explicitly in terms of the conserved quantities of each particle and found that this reduces to that the ratio @xmath226 is infinitely large or infinitely close to zero for the energy @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 of particle @xmath4 ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "such a collision is possible at any latitude for any kerr black hole with @xmath228 if the angular momentum is fine - tuned through multiple scattering in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "however , if we concentrate on the direct collision scenario and the lso collision scenario , the black hole in the limiting case must be maximally rotating to obtain an unboundedly high cm energy .",
    "then , we find that the collision with an unboundedly high cm energy can occur only on the belt between latitudes @xmath229 if we only allow the bound and marginally bound critical massive particles and @xmath230 if we allow all the possible critical particles .",
    "this also applies to the original scenario proposed by baados , silk and west  @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the collision with a very high cm energy might have observational consequences in the contexts of the annihilation of dark matter particles  @xcite , the high - energy hadron collision at inner edge of the accretion disks and the high - velocity collision of the compact objects around supermassive black holes  @xcite .",
    "the present result strongly suggests that if signals due to high - energy collision are to be observed , such signals can be produced primarily on the high - velocity collision belt centered at the equator of a ( nearly ) maximally rotating black hole but not from the polar regions .",
    "we briefly discuss the possible limitations of our result under the test particle approximation . because of this approximation",
    ", we have neglected the self - gravity and back reaction effects .",
    "in fact , these effects on particles orbiting a kerr black hole have not been fully understood yet .",
    "these effects are negligible and the inspiral will be always adiabatic if the mass ratio @xmath231 is sufficiently small because these effects first appear at @xmath232 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath233 is small but nonzero finite , the back reaction effects due to a single high - velocity collision would considerably reduce the spin of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "it is also discussed that infinite collision energy is attained at the horizon after an infinite proper time and radiative effects can not be neglected for such near - critical particles  @xcite .",
    "the effects of radiation reaction and conservative self - gravity on the isco and lso of a kerr black hole are studied  @xcite .",
    "based on those studies , these effects are argued on the near - critical particles around a near - maximally rotating black hole in a different context  @xcite .",
    "we speculate that these effects should be responsible for bounding the cm energy of the near - horizon collision .",
    "this is supported by the fully exact analysis of a system of charged spherical shells surrounding an extremal reissner - nordstm black hole  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to evaluate the upper bound in terms of the mass ratio @xmath234 for the collision of particles on the equatorial plane",
    ". it will be the next step to study these effects on the collision of general particles in the present context .    here",
    ", we discuss the possible extension of the present analysis .",
    "since @xmath235 for the horizon - generating killing vector @xmath26 in the kerr spacetime , we might extend the present analysis for the kerr spacetime to more general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes which admit a killing vector @xmath103 and a killing horizon @xmath236 , which is defined as a null hypersurface on which the killing vector @xmath103 is also null .",
    "it is clear that the present analysis applies in a straightforward manner if the analysis is restricted on the equatorial plane ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for the general geodesic orbits ,",
    "the present analysis is still applicable only if the spacetime possesses three constants of motion and the geodesic equations can be written in the first - order form .",
    "note , however , that there is no analogue of the carter constant for more general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the present analysis will not immediately apply to general stationary and axisymmetric black holes .",
    "moreover , we may speculate that an arbitrarily high cm energy can be attained for the near - horizon collision even in the spacetime which is not stationary and axisymmetric but admits a killing horizon @xmath236 associated with a killing vector @xmath103 .",
    "for a general geodesic particle , the quantity @xmath237 is conserved .",
    "@xmath238 must be positive in the vicinity of the horizon if @xmath103 is future - pointing timelike there .",
    "this is the case for the nonmaximally rotating kerr black holes .",
    "in such a case , it is clear that the critical particle , which has @xmath239 , can not approach the horizon from outside .",
    "on the other hand , for the maximally rotating kerr black hole , this may not apply and this is exactly what baados , silk and west  @xcite exploit .",
    "now , we conjecture that if and only if particles 1 and 2 collide near the killing horizon and the ratio @xmath240 is infinitely large or infinitely close to zero , the cm energy of the two particles is unboundedly high possibly under some genericity condition .",
