    "topological and geometric effects are fundamental quantum - mechanical phenomena .",
    "they appear in various physical contexts , as the aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher effects @xcite , berry s phase @xcite and other models .",
    "such effects are manifested by accumulated topological or geometrical path - dependent phases , which are observed in interference experiments .",
    "such phases have been experimentally detected several times over the years , and are recently one of the interests of quantum simulations @xcite ; for example , several proposals and experiments probing the effects of an external vector - potential have been suggested with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in quantum field theory and particle physics ,",
    "a topological phase similar to the aharonov - bohm effect appears in the context of the wilson - loop operator @xcite , which is an order parameter manifesting the disorder in the confining phase of a gauge theory .",
    "the wilson - loop operator along a curved spacetime path @xmath0 is @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for path ordering ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "wilson - loops manifest confinement through the area dependence of their expectation value , and thus are an important test for confinement .",
    "they are extremely useful in euclidean spacetime , for numerical ( monte - carlo ) simulations . in minkowski spacetime , besides the fact they involve a product of operators along a loop and thus are non - local , they can be interpreted as transition amplitudes , and thus their phases do not contribute to the related probabilities . to gain information from these phases ,",
    "one has to use interference effects as we propose here .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method to observe the area - law manifested in confining theories using superposition and interference of mesons , which unlike in the wilson - loop approach , contains the relevant phase as a relative one .",
    "we draw the connection between our method and the well - known wilson - loop .",
    "note that previous works have already discussed the properties of the inter - quark potential using multiple wilson - loops @xcite .",
    "measurements of wilson - loop operators were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , in section ii , we consider the interference effect of two mesons , consisting of static quarks , in a superposition , and show how to gain the string tension from it .",
    "the relation to the wilson - loop operator is drawn . in section iii , we allow one of the quarks to be dynamic , modeling it as a particle in a moving harmonic potential , and show how to obtain the string tension in that case , using an exact solution of schrodinger equation .",
    "we discuss the relation of our approach to ordinary wilson - loops in section iv .",
    "finally , in section v , we discuss the possibility of realizing the proposed idea using a quantum simulator @xcite .",
    "free quarks can not be found in nature , but rather form hadrons , due to the phenomenon of quark confinement @xcite . a quark and an anti - quark , attached to each other by a confining flux - tube , form a meson , which is the simplest hadron in qcd .",
    "the static potential between the quarks , as a function of their distance @xmath3 , takes the form should also include a @xmath4 term .",
    "however , we neglect it , assuming that @xmath3 is large enough .",
    "this is sufficient for the interference experiment proposed hereby as it is only affected by an area difference . ]",
    "@xmath5 for large values of @xmath3 , where @xmath6 is called the string tension , and @xmath7 is the coupling constant @xcite .    , @xmath8 form a meson of length @xmath9 at time @xmath10 .",
    "while @xmath11 remains static , @xmath8 is externally moved ( with no dynamics of its own ) in a superposition of two possible trajectories , corresponding to its internal states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , creating a superposition of mesons . the path of the @xmath14 fermion is drawn in red , and the path of the @xmath15 one - in blue . at time @xmath16 , both the trajectories arrive again at @xmath9 , and the state is then mixed using a unitary transformation ( equation ( [ unit ] ) ) , causing an interference effect . in case of confinement , the interference phase depends on the area @xmath17 ( defined in equation ( [ adefinition ] ) ) in case of confinement - as does the wilson - loop .",
    "the phase is accessible from the probabilities to find @xmath8 in either of its internal states ( equation ( [ staticprobs ] ) ) . ]",
    "consider two _ static _ quarks , initially separated by distance @xmath9 . by static",
    "we mean that we treat them as external sources of electric field , which do not have their own dynamics , but can be externally moved .",
    "taking confinement into account , we know that the two quarks are connected by a long flux - tube , with length @xmath3 , forming a `` meson '' . if we allow one quark to move along some trajectory @xmath18 , we get the hamiltonian @xmath19 where we generally assume that @xmath20 is an unknown quantity .    next ,",
    "assume that the moving quark has some two internal energy levels @xmath21 , which we denote by @xmath22 - eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath23 .",
    "we define the projection operators to the subspaces of internal levels as @xmath24 , and introduce an internal level dependent paths @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 the energy levels are used to generate level - dependent spatial positions .",
    "the choice of these levels depends on the separation method .",
    "for example , if one considers an abelian theory , where @xmath21 corresponds to the spin ( @xmath27 ) , the separation could be achieved using an external magnetic field , @xmath28 , then @xmath29 .",
    "a concrete example of generating such a separation is found in @xcite .",
    "we wish to consider the interference effect of two mesons in superposition , varying their length .",
    "we shall consider a superposition of a meson with a @xmath14 fermion and a meson with a @xmath15 fermion , initially with the same length ( i.e. , @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) , which are stretched by moving the right fermion in two opposite directions , and then , at time @xmath32 , brought back to the same length ( i.e. , @xmath30 also for @xmath33 .",
    "the opposite directions impose more conditions on the paths : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and since the @xmath15 fermion should not `` go through '' the static fermion at @xmath36 , we also demand @xmath37 .",
    "the initial state is , of course , @xmath38    solving schrodinger equation , one gets that @xmath39 and so in order to measure @xmath20 , one has merely to cause an interference between the two states .",
    "we perform ramsey interference , by applying the rotation @xmath40 on the state at @xmath16 , and one obtains , up to a global phase , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the area enclosed between the two trajectories ( as in figure [ fig1 ] ) . thus , the probabilities to find the system on each of the internal levels are @xmath43    by performing such an interference experiment , and measuring the phase , knowing the area difference one can calculate the string tension @xmath20 . moreover , if the phase does not exhibit such an area law , it means that the system is not within a confining phase , and hence this measurement can be used for probing the confining phase as well .",
    "next we wish to introduce a simple model of dynamical charges , in order to examine the corrections to the latter static case .",
    "in particular , we wish to examine decoherence and destructive interference due to excitations of the mesons . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that one of the quarks is static ( the one placed in @xmath36 ) , and that the other one , having a mass @xmath44 , is trapped in a harmonic potential , centered around @xmath45 .",
    "this harmonic trap is merely an external trapping potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath46    assume that the dynamic quark has two internal energy levels , denoted and treated as before .",
    "we introduce an interaction between the internal and external degrees of freedom , of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 are opening functions which are zero for times @xmath49 , and are assumed to be smooth enough , i.e. at least their first and second time derivatives vanish for @xmath50 .",
    "define @xmath51 ( the same conditions on @xmath25 apply as in the static case , of course , and that poses conditions on @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 .",
    "then one gets , after completing the square , that the total hamiltonian is ( neglecting constants ) @xmath54 where the first part is just a harmonic oscillator , with the center of its potential following classically the trajectory @xmath55 : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the next step is the solution of schrodinger equation for our hamiltonian : @xmath58 noting that the internal levels are not changed by the hamiltonian , we can first solve for a given internal level @xmath21 and consider only the harmonic part .",
    "thus if we set for a given @xmath21 , @xmath59 we get that @xmath60 is the solution of a schrodinger equation for a classically moving harmonic potential : @xmath61 using the solution of this equation in @xmath62-space , we get that the solutions ( not eigenstates ) are @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the energies and eigenstates of a `` regular '' , fixed - potential harmonic oscillator , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "our initial condition is @xmath67 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the oscillator is supposed to be in its non moving ground state , and thus we expect that @xmath68 for these times .",
    "thus @xmath69 . using the continuity of the equation of motion of @xmath70",
    ", we get that @xmath71 as well . from the smoothness of the opening functions we know that @xmath72 .",
    "thus we conclude that in order to start from a local ground state , the solution must be @xmath73    next , we wish to interpret this solution in terms of local instantaneous eigenvalues .",
    "that is , the states @xmath74 , defined as eigenvalues of @xmath75 in the `` frozen '' time @xmath76 .",
    "we already know that the system starts at @xmath10 with the eigenstate @xmath77 , but what s later ? in order to do that , we define @xmath78 .",
    "writing @xmath75 in terms of @xmath79 at a fixed @xmath76 yields this diagonalization : it is merely a transformation to a frame which moves with the potential , which is its instantaneous rest frame ( irf ) .",
    "consider the position - dependent part of @xmath80 , in terms of the irf .",
    "call it @xmath81 : @xmath82 in the irf basis , this is a coherent state - poissonian distribution of @xmath74 states : @xmath83 where @xmath84      suppose we start , at @xmath10 , with an initial state @xmath85 then , defining @xmath86 and using the solutions from the previous section , we get @xmath87    let us understand the meaning of this state .",
    "we start at @xmath10 with a superposition of two states with two different values of @xmath21 .",
    "both of them are in the ground state of an oscillator , centered around the same position ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "then we `` move '' the wavefunctions together with the potential : the opening functions are translated to the trajectories @xmath89 .",
    "each element of the superposition `` goes '' through another path , since the moving of the potential depends on the internal level .",
    "a superposition of coherent states in the terms of the local irfs is created , and eventually , at @xmath16 , both the interaction functions are closed , i.e. the two potentials experienced by internal levels overlap again , and @xmath90 .    next , trace out the oscillator degrees of freedom at @xmath16 , to obtain an internal - level density matrix .",
    "the density matrix at @xmath16 is @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "one can see that the phases depend on two parts : one , @xmath95 , is totally calculable .",
    "the other is @xmath20 dependent and ca nt be calculated unless @xmath20 is known .",
    "the @xmath20 dependent phases are only global ( the probabilities - the diagonal terms in @xmath96 do not depend on them ) . in order to observe the phases , we wish to cause an interference , i.e. to rotate the state",
    ": we act on the system at @xmath16 with the rotation operator @xmath40 .",
    "one can use the diagonal terms in the new density matrix @xmath97 to determine the probabilities to measure each of the internal levels .",
    "the probabilities are @xmath98 where @xmath99 we see that now the probabilities depend on the phase difference , and that it became a relative phase indeed .",
    "however , how do we use it in order to measure the string tension ?",
    "first , one must note that @xmath100 is governs the visibility of the interference : if @xmath101 , one gets equal probabilities to both measurement outcomes , and hence no information can be gained and the interference is lost .",
    "we shall consider the effect of @xmath100 in detail .",
    "however , let us first focus on the role of the phase difference , assuming it is not screened by @xmath100 .",
    "the phase difference consists of two parts . the first one , @xmath102 , is @xmath20 independent , and once the phase is obtained from the probabilities , it can be subtracted .",
    "hence we are left with @xmath103 where @xmath17 is the area enclosed between the two paths in spacetime !",
    "exactly the area dependence which is expected in any abelian and non - abelian gauge theory within the confining phase .. thus , the interference effect measures the string tension @xmath20 in case of confinement ; otherwise , the area law will not be manifested and thus being outside the confining phase can be probed this way as well .",
    "let us discuss the effect of @xmath100 .",
    "in order to understand it , we calculate it explicitly ; using the definitions of @xmath104 , we get that @xmath105 , where @xmath106    the interference is maximal when @xmath107 ; that corresponds to @xmath108 , which means that the final state is an eigenstate rather than a poissonian superposition . in that case ,",
    ". then we get @xmath110 if we wish to consider the cases in which there is some disturbance to the interference , but it is negligible , we should consider the limit @xmath111 .",
    "this is obtained when the conditions @xmath112 are met .",
    "this can be understood in terms of uncertainty principle : the final coherent state is displaced in phase space .",
    "the displacement in @xmath62 is @xmath113 , and the first condition is met if we require it to be much smaller than the ground state s @xmath114 ; the displacement in @xmath115 is @xmath116 , and the second condition is met if we require it to be much smaller than the ground state s @xmath117 .    let us see what is the limitation on the trajectories @xmath118 , if one wishes to get a good interference according to this criterion . in order to do that ,",
    "let us write the explicit solution for @xmath119 .",
    "we wish to solve the differential equation @xmath66 .",
    "previously , we have obtained the initial conditions @xmath120 , and thus the homogenous solution is zero , and we are left only with the particular solution , which can be found using green s function : @xmath121 demanding @xmath122 , we get a condition on the maximal acceleration @xmath123 : @xmath124 and the very same condition is obtained from demanding @xmath125 .",
    "thus we conclude that the interference is not ruined if the charges accelerations are small enough all along the paths .",
    "next , let us examine the relation of the proposed method with the wilson - loop operator approach .",
    "the area @xmath17 , enclosed between the two paths of the two quarks in superposition , is the same area on which the wilson - loop of a single quark , moved in spacetime along the union of the paths , would depend , and with the same string tension .",
    "thus , the interference phase and this wilson - loop s phase are the same .",
    "we shall now describe how to derive a quantitative relation to the wilson - loop operator in the case of static quarks and strong coupling limit .",
    "denote the state of heavy ( _ static _ ) @xmath126 , separated by distance @xmath3 by @xmath127 , and write it in terms of the gauge field degrees of freedom .",
    "assuming confinement , this corresponds to a meson state , where the two quarks are connected by a flux tube , and thus @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the hamiltonian of the gauge field ; in particular , in the strong coupling limit one gets @xmath130 where @xmath2 stands for path ordering .",
    "we wish to calculate , within the strong coupling limit , the expectation value ( in minkowski space ) of the wilson - loop operator , corresponding to the loop depicted in figure ( [ fig2]a ) .",
    "this can be decomposed to four different parts : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath134 part contribution is zero if we work in the temporal gauge .",
    "let us now see the contribution of the other three parts of the loop . in order to do that ,",
    "let us discretize the function @xmath135 as in figure ( [ fig2]b ) .",
    "define @xmath136 acting on the vacuum , this operator creates ( in the strong limit ) a flux tube from @xmath137 to @xmath138 ; i.e. , the static charge in @xmath137 is raised and the static charge in @xmath138 is lowered . using these terms ,",
    "the wilson - loop operator we wish to calculate becomes @xmath139 since @xmath140 , this expression simplifies to @xmath141    finally , let us calculate the expectation of the wilson - loop in the vacuum state .",
    "taking the vacuum energy as zero , the left @xmath142 contributes 1 .",
    "the right @xmath143 , acting on the vacuum , creates a flux tube between @xmath36 and @xmath144 , and the @xmath145 on the left of it contributes a phase of @xmath146 since it is an eigenstate .",
    "then , each of the @xmath147 s in the product shortens or stretches the flux tube , and the @xmath145 to the left of it adds up a phase of @xmath148 .",
    "this is a process of creating a flux tube with length @xmath9 at @xmath10 , changing its length according to @xmath135 , until @xmath16 where its original length is regained and it is destroyed .",
    "the amplitude for this process is thus , according to the given explanation , the expectation value of the wilson - loop , and it is @xmath149    taking back the continuum limit , we take @xmath150 , or @xmath151 . this transforms the sum to an integral , and this integral is equal to @xmath17 , the area enclosed by the curve - the area law of confinement : @xmath152        thus we can conclude , that in the strong coupling limit , taking the solution from equation ( [ statschro ] ) , @xmath153 ( where @xmath154 denotes the curve enclosed by the motion of the @xmath21th element of the superposition ) - so we see that indeed , in this limit , the transition amplitude is the corresponding wilson - loop , and it is a global phase , so in order to obtain knowledge about it one has to transform it to a relative one , using the above interference prescription .",
    "quantum simulations @xcite are a rapidly growing field , based on the idea that quantum systems can simulate each other . thus , quantum systems which are inaccessible for measurement , can be simulated using other quantum systems , which are controllable , accessible and measurable in the laboratory , such as cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite and other systems .",
    "these systems serve as an `` analog quantum simulators '' .",
    "recently , several methods have been proposed for quantum simulation of high energy physics , for example , simulations of dynamic scalar @xcite ( vaccum entanglement ) and fermionic fields @xcite ( thirring and gross - neveu models ) , and fermions in lattice qft @xcite . simulations for dynamic gauge fields have been proposed as well .",
    "simulations of pure - gauge @xmath155 theories ( simulating the abelian kogut - susskind @xcite hamiltonian or a truncated version of it ) , using becs @xcite or single atoms @xcite in optical lattices have been proposed , as well as simulations of other pure - gauge @xmath155 theories with ultracold atoms @xcite . simulations of @xmath155 theories with dynamic matter have been proposed as well @xcite . recently , several proposals for quantum simulations of non - abelian theories have been suggested as well @xcite . besides these lattice works , a proposal for continuous qed simulation @xcite has been suggested as well .",
    "a recent detailed description of a simplified simulation approach is found in @xcite .    in quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using cold atoms in optical lattices , such as @xcite",
    ", one could realize the experiment proposed in this paper .",
    "a first proposal for area law probing in the suggested method has been proposed for an abelian @xmath156 gauge theory , in which lasers are used to create a superposition of fermions , which results in a superposition of mesons , and to perform the ramsey interference required for the measurement .",
    "a detailed discussion of the proposal can be found in @xcite .    as the above proposal is general ,",
    "we believe it may be useful in future simulations of gauge theories for probing confinement and its area law .",
    "we have presented a method to measure the string tension of a confining flux - tube using superposition and interference of mesons .",
    "interestingly , the two states in superposition experience _ different _ electric fields .",
    "this is a reminiscent of the concept of `` private potential '' @xcite . by exploiting an area - dependent phase due to the linearity of the static quark potential in the confining phase of gauge theories , we have observed confinement using an interference of the mesons",
    "this allows to convert the global phase ( which appears , for example , in wilson - loops which are related to transition amplitudes ) , to a relative phase , observable in probabilities .    in the coulomb phase ( as in 3 + 1 qed ) or in any other @xmath157 phase , with @xmath158 ,",
    "the appropriate gauge field state does not include a flux tube as in the confining phase .",
    "hence , the final probabilities will not manifest a simple area dependence .",
    "this can be used to probe a transition between confining and non - confining phases .",
    "although it is only a gedanken experiment in the context of particle physics , such an experiment , in its lattice version , may be realized and used to observe confinement effects and phase transitions within a quantum simulation of confining gauge theories @xcite .",
