    "consequently , the interferences between the pomeron and @xmath1 exchanges can be studied with respect to the intermediate - high - energy measurement at small @xmath143  @xcite , through which the @xmath1 exchange can be determined .",

    "this resonance becomes interesting due to its mass position near threshold and relatively larger phase space in the nrcqm .",
