    "0.1 cm the recent work of d. boyd and f. rodriguez - villegas , @xcite , has shown a relationship between the hyperbolic volume of 3-manifolds and the logarithmic mahler measure of @xmath1-variable polynomials .",
    "the _ logarithmic mahler measure _ of a non - zero polynomial @xmath2 $ ] is defined as : @xmath3 in particular , boyd and rodriguez - villegas show that if @xmath4 is the a - polynomial associated to a knot then , in certain cases , @xmath5 equals the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement .",
    "consequently , by using a classical formula of humbert , they show that for arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds , up to multiplication by a known constant , @xmath6 equals the value of the dedekind zeta function of a certain imaginary quadratic extension .",
    "the above results show the rich arithmetic nature of the hyperbolic volume .",
    "it is a well - known philosophy due to w. thurston that the volume and chern - simons invariant of a hyperbolic 3-manifold correspond to the real and imagine parts of a holomorphic function .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that the chern - simons invariant should give interesting arithmetic consequences .    in this short note",
    ", we show that a chern - simons type invariant gives us the exact value of the integral of @xmath7 over a certain path in the a - polynomial curve . in the light of thurston s philosophy , this integral should be related to a certain unknown imaginary counterpart of the mahler measure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in the next section we will briefly review about the a - polynomials and then give an exposition on the godbillon - vey invariant , a kind of chern - simons invariant , and a schlfli - type formula for the godbillon - vey invariant .",
    "the last section contains our main result , where we get the exact values of the integral of the 1-form @xmath7 over the real part of the a - polynomials curve of certain hyperbolic knots .",
    "the author would like to thank the referee for pointing out several inaccuracies in the previous version of this paper .",

    "a classical way to study groups is to look at their representations into a linear space .    for a 3-manifold group ,",
    "the space of representations into @xmath24 was first systematically studied by culler and shalen @xcite and has found spectacular applications in geometry and topology of 3-manifolds .    the @xmath24 character variety of a knot complement @xmath8 is defined by : @xmath25 here , we use the algebro - geometric quotient in which @xmath26 and @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 for all @xmath29    in general , the character variety is a affine algebraic set of high dimension and therefore it is hard to work with directly . in @xcite ,",
    "a more manageable algebraic set is introduced by projecting @xmath30 into @xmath31 using the eigenvalues of the meridian and longitude .",
    "this algebraic set is defined by a integral polynomial in two variables .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath32 be the restriction map induced by the inclusion @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined by associating to a pair @xmath35 a character @xmath36 such that @xmath37 let @xmath38 be the union of all the connected component @xmath39 of @xmath30 such that @xmath40 is @xmath41-dimensional then the closure of @xmath42 is a plane curve .",
    "the defining equation of this affine curve , up to multiplication by a non - zero constant , is an integral polynomial @xmath43 called the _ a - polynomial _ of @xmath16 thus the a - polynomial parameterizes the restriction of the character variety to the peripheral subgroup .",
    "in general , the a - polynomial has a factor of @xmath44 which corresponds to the abelian representations . without ambiguity ,",

    "the cut - and - paste method is originated from gauge theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "its main steps consist of the followings :    - interpret the godbillon - vey invariant of a representation as a kind of chern - simons invariant associated to the universal covering group @xmath87    - define the godbillon - vey invariant on a manifold with boundary @xmath8 by gauge - fixing a normal form of the flat connection near @xmath88    - on @xmath23 we prove a formula which expresses the difference between the godbillon - vey invariants of two representations in a family in terms of the boundary holonomies .    - to apply the formula in the previous step to compute the godbillon - vey invariant of surgery manifolds , for each representation @xmath36 we have to find a path which connects @xmath89 to a a representation whose godbillon - vey invariant is already known .    in this paper , we will need the following result .",

    "the normal form of a flat connection is a nice form of the connection near the torus boundary obtained by using gauge transformation .",
    "a path of flat connections is called _ purely hyperbolic _ if its boundary holonomies @xmath98 and @xmath99 are hyperbolic elements of @xmath82 for all @xmath100    here we work with the group @xmath82 instead of @xmath58 since @xmath82 is simply connected and therefore we can trivialize all the principal bundle . the group @xmath82 can be described as @xmath101 with the group operation defined by :    @xmath102 where @xmath103 here @xmath104 is defined by its principal value .",
    "we then call an element of @xmath82 _ elliptic , parabolic _ or _",
    "hyperbolic _ if it covers an element of the corresponding type in @xmath105    the @xmath82 character variety of a knot complement @xmath8 is defined by @xmath106 as the knot complement @xmath8 satisfies @xmath107 any @xmath58 representation of @xmath15 can be lifted to an @xmath82 representation .",

    "it is well - known that @xmath135-surgery on the figure eight knot gives a torus bundle .",
    "as the torus bundle admits a self map of degree bigger than 1 , it follows from @xcite that @xmath136 to find the points on the a - polynomial curve corresponding to characters in @xmath137 we solve the equations @xmath138",
