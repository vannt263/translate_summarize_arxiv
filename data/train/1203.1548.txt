    "sparse recovery is one of the essential issues in many fields of signal processing , including compressed sampling ( cs ) @xcite , which is a novel sampling theory . in some applications such as magnetoencephalography ( meg ) @xcite , source localization @xcite and analog - to - digital conversion @xcite",
    ", the sparse unknowns can be recovered jointly , which results in the problem of multiple - measurement vectors ( mmv ) . in the modulated wideband converter ( mwc )",
    "@xcite , the locations of narrow - band signals in a wide spectrum range are detected by solving the mmv problem , which is of great significance to the performance of the conversion system .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed to derive the sparse solution to the mmv problem .",
    "the omp algorithm for mmv @xcite finds a sparse solution by sequentially building up a small subset of column vectors selected from @xmath1 to represent @xmath2 .",
    "focal underdetermined system solver ( focuss ) methods @xcite compute the constraint solution in an iterative procedure using the standard method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "rembo @xcite reduces mmv to smv by multiplying a random column vector drawn from an absolutely continuous distribution .",
    "recently , a robust algorithm for joint - sparse recovery named joint @xmath0 approximation algorithm ( jlza ) @xcite has been proposed to calculate the solution in a fixed point iteration with an approximation of @xmath0 norm .",
    "different algorithms which aim at solving the problem of mmv are surveyed and compared in @xcite .",
    "this work extends a recently proposed zero - point attracting projection ( zap ) algorithm @xcite to the mmv scenario .",
    "derived from the adaptive filtering framework , zap defines the cost function as the sparsity and updates the sparse representation in the solution space .",
    "specifically , starting from the least squares solution , it is modified in a fixed step - size along the negative gradient direction of an approximate @xmath3 norm towards the zero point , and then projected back to the solution space again .",
    "this operation is executed iteratively until the stopping condition is satisfied . in this paper , an approximate @xmath0 norm is adopted in zap and the recursive solution to mmv",
    "is derived .",
    "in addition , the step - size of zero - point attraction is varied dynamically to accelerate the convergence .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prob ] formulates the mmv problem and the approximate @xmath0 norm .",
    "section  [ sec : zapmmv ] introduces the zap algorithm for mmv , and further discussions and improvements are given in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : simu ] shows the simulation results and this paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the problem of mmv is formulated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the matrix of measurements , @xmath6 is the sensing matrix , and @xmath7 is the unknown signal assumed jointly @xmath8-sparse , i.e. it has @xmath8 nonzero rows at most .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the following problem @xmath9 finds the unique @xmath8-sparse solution provided that @xmath10 where @xmath11 returns a column vector whose @xmath12th item is any vector norm of the @xmath12th row of @xmath13 , @xmath14 counts nonzero elements of the vector , @xmath15 is the smallest possible integer such that there exist @xmath15 columns of matrix @xmath16 that are linearly dependent , and @xmath17 is the rank of matrix @xmath18 .    according to the references @xcite , we choose @xmath0 norm @xmath19 to describe the joint sparsity of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes a column vector with @xmath22 norm of the @xmath12th row of @xmath13 as its @xmath12th item . following @xcite ,",
    "the sparsifying penalty can be further approximated by a continuous function @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath12th row of @xmath13 , and the function @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 it is readily recognized that @xmath27 converges to the @xmath3 quasi - norm as @xmath28 approaches infinity .",
    "since it is non - differentiable at the origin , the derivative of @xmath25 can be replaced by one of its sub - derivatives @xmath29 where sgn(@xmath30 ) denotes the sign function with sgn@xmath31 .",
    "in this section we extend zap to the mmv scenario .",
    "further discussions and improvements of this algorithm will be shown in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "zap for mmv derives the sparse solution in an iterative procedure . in the @xmath32th iteration ,",
    "the solution is first updated along the negative gradient direction of the sparsifying penalty ( [ appl20norm ] ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the temporary solution , @xmath35 denotes the step size , and @xmath36 is a gradient matrix with partial derivative @xmath37 as its @xmath38th element , where @xmath39 stands for the @xmath38th entry of @xmath13 . substituting ( [ falpha ] ) into ( [ appl20norm ] ) , and together with ( [ falpha ] ) , the @xmath38th element of the gradient matrix can be calculated @xmath40 then the solution is projected to the solution space to satisfy @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the pseudo - inverse matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "now we have introduced the basic procedure of zap for mmv .",
    "compared with solving the mmv problem column by column independently , zap for mmv utilizes the information of joint sparsity by means of ( [ partial1 ] ) .",
    "the updating step size of each element is renormalized according to the norm of the corresponding row , which greatly improves the recovery performance .",
    "detailed discussions about the effect of the parameters and a fast convergence version of the proposed algorithm are given in the following section .",
    "so far , the parameters involved in the zap for mmv are the @xmath3 norm approximation factor @xmath44 and the step size @xmath45 .",
    "these parameters should be selected carefully .    * _ the choice of @xmath44 _ * : the value of @xmath44 has a great impact on the performance of the proposed algorithm . by ( [ falpha ] )",
    "we know that large @xmath44 pulls small values to zero quickly but the range of its influence is small , while a small one has the opposite effect .",
    "furthermore , according to ( [ falpha ] ) , larger @xmath44 leads to a better approximation of the @xmath3 norm , but simultaneously produces more local minima in the cost function @xcite . in practice , we suggest @xmath46 to be a quarter to a half of the smallest nonzero item of @xmath47 .    * _ the choice of @xmath45 _ * : as the step size in the gradient descent iterations , the parameter @xmath45 suggests a tradeoff between the speed of convergence and the accuracy of the solution .",
    "big @xmath45 indicates faster convergence but less accuracy , while small @xmath45 yields more accurate solution but costs more iterations . in order to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm ,",
    "the idea of variable step size is taken into consideration .",
    "the control scheme is rather direct : @xmath45 is initialized to be a large value , and reduced by a factor @xmath48 when the algorithm is convergent .",
    "this reduction is conducted until @xmath45 is sufficiently small , i.e. @xmath49 , which means that the recovery error reaches a low level .    * _ the criterion of convergence _ * : it is significantly important to select an appropriate criterion of convergence to make full use of variable step size . considering the iteration",
    "is performed along the negative gradient direction of the sparsifying penalty ( [ appl20norm ] ) , it is obvious that the algorithm reaches steady - state when the penalty starts increasing . to reduce the complexity of evaluation and improve the stability , the criterion is checked every @xmath50 iterations .    *",
    "_ the initial value _ * : following the zap algorithm for smv , the least squares solution is selected as the initial value , i.e. @xmath51 .    * _ the stopping condition _ * : the proposed algorithm stops ( a ) when @xmath45 gets below @xmath52 or ( b ) when the number of iterations reaches the bound @xmath53 .    finally , the proposed algorithm denoted by zapmmv is described in table  [ codeofalgorithm ] .    [ codeofalgorithm ]    .the zapmmv algorithm [ cols= \" < \" , ]     in the final experiment , ompmmv and zapmmv are applied to solve the mmv problem in the mwc to compare their recovery performance .",
    "jlza is not included since its performance is not so fine in this experiment . in our simulation , @xmath54 channels with @xmath55mhz adcs",
    "are utilized to sample a sparse signal at nyquist rate @xmath55ghz , and each sampling sequence contains @xmath56 pulses in one period .",
    "the original sparse signal contaminated by gaussian white noise contains @xmath57 narrow - band components ( each of @xmath58mhz , and unknown location ) .",
    "the waveform and the power spectrum density ( psd ) of the input signals with in - band snr @xmath59db , @xmath60db , and @xmath61db are depicted in figure  [ signalspectrum ] .",
    "figure  [ mwc ] demonstrates the probability of successfully detecting the locations of all narrow - band components , two narrow - band components , and only one component , where the average in - band snr of the original signal varies from @xmath62db to @xmath63db .",
