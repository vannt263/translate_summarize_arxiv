    "the analysis is simplest for the entangled state @xmath11 the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer , respectively , to electron and hole at two distant locations .",
    "the particle to be teleported is another electron , in the state @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the second electron @xmath16 may tunnel into the empty state representing the hole @xmath13 , but only if the spins match .",
    "if @xmath17 denotes the tunneling amplitude , then this happens with probability @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting annihilation of the two quasiparticle excitations collapses the combined state @xmath19 to the state @xmath20 , so the state of the second electron @xmath16 is teleported to the first electron @xmath12 at a distant location .",
    "the usual limitations @xcite of teleportation apply .",
    "since tunneling is an unpredictable stochastic event , it has to be detected and communicated ( by classical means ) to the distant location .",
    "there is therefore no instantaneous transfer of information . and",
    "since the electron has to be annihilated in order to be teleported , its ( unknown ) state can not be copied .",
    "teleportation by particle - hole annihilation thus presents a rather dramatic demonstration of the no - cloning theorem of quantum mechanics @xcite in action .",
    "a major obstacle to teleportation in the solid state is the requirement of fast time - resolved detection . to circumvent this difficulty we identify a low - frequency noise correlator that demonstrates the entanglement swapping resulting from two - way teleportation .",
    "two - way teleportation means that upon annihilation the electron and hole are teleported to opposite ends of the system .",
    "the noise correlator measures the degree of entanglement at the two ends .",
    "this demonstrates teleportation if the two ends are not connected by any phase - coherent path .",
    "an additional benefit from this detection scheme is that the degree of entanglement is invariant under local unitary transformations , so no precise knowledge and control of the phase relation of the entangled electrons and holes is required .",
    "we now proceed to the general formulation of teleportation by particle - hole annihilation .",
    "we follow ref .   by focusing on a particular implementation using edge channels in the quantum hall effect regime (",
    "see fig .",
    "[ teleport_qhe ] ) . the entangled degree of freedom is the landau level index @xmath21 , which labels the two occupied edge channels near the fermi energy @xmath22 .",
    "electrons are incident in a narrow range @xmath23 above @xmath22 from two voltage sources .",
    "we write the incoming state @xmath24 in second quantized form , in terms of operators @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) that excite the @xmath27-th edge channel at the left ( right ) voltage source .",
    "( the excitation energy @xmath28 is omitted for simplicity . )",
    "the vacuum state @xmath29 represents the fermi sea at zero temperature ( all states below @xmath22 occupied , all states above @xmath22 empty ) .",
    "scattering matrices @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( for the left and right barriers acting as entanglers ) and @xmath32 ( for the central barrier acting as annihilator ) transform the incoming state @xmath33 to the outgoing state @xmath34 . the full expression for @xmath34 is lengthy , but we only need the terms that correspond to the annihilation of electron and hole at the central barrier .",
    "if electron and hole have annihilated , this implies that there are two filled edge channels in contact @xmath35 and two empty edge channels in contact @xmath36 .",
    "so these terms can be extracted by the projection operator @xmath37 we have introduced the number operator @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the creation operator for the @xmath27-th edge channel approaching contact @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ teleport_qhe ] .",
    "the projected outgoing state , @xmath41 contains three types of contributions : 1 . a term @xmath42 describing two filled edge channels to the right of the right barrier ( creation operator @xmath43 ) ; 2 . a term @xmath44 describing two filled edge channels to the left of the left barrier ( creation operator @xmath45 ) ; 3 .",
    "a sum of four terms @xmath46 describing one filled edge channel at the left and one at the right .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 are given in terms of the reflection and transmission matrices of the three barriers : @xmath48 the superscript @xmath49 indicates the transpose of a matrix and @xmath50 is a pauli matrix . if we denote by @xmath51 the order of magnitude of the tunneling amplitudes , then @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , so it is justified to neglect @xmath9 relative to @xmath55 .",
    "to identify the entangled electron - hole excitations we transform from particle to hole operators at contact @xmath35 and to the right of the right barrier : @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the new vacuum state is @xmath58 .",
    "the projected outgoing state becomes , upon normalization , @xmath59 it represents a superposition of the vacuum state and a particle - hole state @xmath60 with weight @xmath61 .",
    "the degree of entanglement of @xmath60 is quantified by the concurrence @xcite , which ranges from @xmath62 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath63 ( maximal entanglement ) . the concurrence @xmath64 is determined by the eigenvalues @xmath65 of the matrix product @xmath66 .",
    "a simple expression for these two eigenvalues exists if the left and right barrier each have the same tunnel probability for the two edge channels : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 an eigenvalue of @xmath70 . in this symmetric case",
    "the left and right barrier each produce maximally entangled electron - hole pairs @xcite .",
    "the concurrence ( [ cdef ] ) then depends only on the tunnel probabilities @xmath71 of the central barrier , @xmath72 .",
    "if the central tunnel barrier is also symmetric ( @xmath73 ) , then @xmath74 , so the electron at the far left and the hole at the far right are maximally entangled .",
    "the two - way teleportation following particle - hole annihilation has therefore led to full entanglement swapping .",
    "the entanglement swapping can be detected by correlating the current fluctuations @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the @xmath27-th edge channel at the left and right end of the system .",
    "the correlator @xmath77 is zero , because there is no direct path between the two ends .",
    "a nonzero value is obtained by correlating with the current fluctuations @xmath78 at the central contacts @xmath40 .",
    "the third order correlator @xmath79 is still zero .",
    "the first nonvanishing correlator is of fourth order , for example @xmath80 .",
    "we subtract the products of second order correlators to obtain the irreducible ( cumulant ) correlator at low frequencies , @xmath81 it does nt matter if @xmath82 is replaced by @xmath83 or @xmath84 , that only changes the correlator by a minus sign . following ref .",
    ", we have calculated @xmath85 in terms of the transmission and reflection matrices , with the result @xmath86    as in earlier work @xcite , we use low - frequency current correlators in the tunneling regime to detect entanglement through the violation of a bell inequality @xcite .",
    "we need the following rational function of correlators : @xmath87 by mixing the channels locally at the left and right end of the system , the transmission and reflection matrices are transformed as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , with unitary @xmath90 matrices @xmath91 .",
    "the bell parameter @xcite @xmath92 is maximized by a certain choice of @xmath93 at the value @xcite @xmath94^{1/2 } , \\label{emaxresult}\\ ] ] determined by the two eigenvalues @xmath95 of the matrix product @xmath96 .    to close the circle we need to show that @xmath96 and @xmath66 have the same eigenvalues , so that eqs .",
    "( [ cdef ] ) and ( [ emaxresult ] ) imply the one - to - one relation @xmath97 between the concurrence and the maximal value of the bell parameter @xcite . in general the two sets of eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath65 are different , but they become the same in the tunneling regime . here is the proof .    in the tunneling regime",
    "the reflection matrices @xmath98 are close to being unitary . for any @xmath90 unitary matrix @xmath99 it holds that @xmath100 with @xmath101 the determinant of @xmath99 . with the help of this identity",
    "we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gammadef ] ) as @xmath102 hence @xmath103 , as we set out to prove .    a final remark : the bell inequality states that @xmath104 for a local hidden - variable theory @xcite .",
    "we have not proven this statement for our fourth order correlator ( although we do not doubt that it holds ) .",
    "what we have proven is that a measurement of the fourth order correlator can be used to determine the degree of entanglement , which is all we need for our purpose .",
    "the invention of bennett , brassard , crpeau , jozsa , peres , and wootters @xcite teleports isolated and hence distinguishable particles , so it applies equally well to bosons ( such as photons ) as it does to fermions ( such as electrons ) .",
    "however , the difficulty of isolating electrons in the solid state has so far prevented the realization of their ingenious idea .",
    "what we have shown here is that the existence of the fermi sea makes it possible to implement teleportation of non - interacting fermions using sources in local thermal equilibrium  something which is fundamentally forbidden for non - interacting bosons @xcite .",
    "our fermions are not isolated electrons but particle - hole excitations created by tunneling events .",
    "the act of teleportation is the inverse process , the annihilation of the particle when it tunnels into the hole .",
    "an advantage of working with particle - hole excitations in the fermi sea is that no local control of single electrons is required .",
    "indeed , the experiment proposed in fig .  [ teleport_qhe ] does not need nanofabrication to isolate and manipulate electrons .",
    "a disadvantage is that the success rate of teleportation is small , because tunneling is a rare event .",
    "since the particle - hole excitation survives if the tunneling attempt has failed , it should be possible to increase the teleportation rate by introducing more tunnel barriers in series .",
    "such a more elaborate teleportation scheme might also be used to perform logical operations , along the lines of ref .  .",
