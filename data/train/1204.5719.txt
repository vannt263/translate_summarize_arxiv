    "globular cluster systems rank among the oldest objects known in our galaxy .",
    "their ages set a lower limit for the age of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , a precise measurement of the absolute age of a globular cluster ( gc ) is strongly dependent on the knowledge of its precise distance and reddening ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "m4 is a peculiar cluster in terms of interstellar reddening .",
    "it has a surprisingly large total amount of reddening ( @xmath13 , @xcite ) for its small distance ( @xmath14 ) , which is due to its location in the galactic plane , behind the sco - oph cloud complex .",
    "moreover , the cluster suffers from a significant amount of spatially differential reddening ( @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) which has been taken into account in some recent studies of m4 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in the literature ,",
    "approximations for peak - to - peak differences within a distance to the cluster centre of at least @xmath15 range from @xmath16 in @xcite to @xmath17 in @xcite .",
    "the extinction law that is used to correct for interstellar reddening can be different for each line of sight , depending on the type of dust located between the observer and the object , where the total to selective extinction @xmath18 is known to be a good index of the extinction properties of a particular dust type ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in many studies of star clusters a standard reddening law is applied , assuming dust characteristics typical of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) as the main origin of interstellar extinction : a reddening law with a value of @xmath0 close to 3.1 is typically adopted ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . however , since @xmath0 defines both the shape of the reddening law and the ratio between extinction and reddening , a reconsideration of this standard assumption is appropriate when determining the absolute distance of a reddened stellar system .    for m4",
    ", there are several hints in former studies where the authors suggest an abnormal dust type , or at least remark on certain discrepancies that arise when using a standard assumption of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , @xcite compare their spectroscopically derived temperatures of bright red giant branch ( rgb ) stars to the temperatures derived from photometric indices and found @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite propose an @xmath0  closer to 4 then to 3 \" by evaluating the relative location of rgb sequences from m4 compared to m3 , m13 and m92 using data from @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the only study that does not rely on the calibration of photometric magnitudes reaches a similar result : @xcite derived a geometric distance for m4 from proper motion and radial velocity measurements and find a value significantly smaller than the accepted photometric distance , a result which is only in agreement with canonical horizontal branch ( hb ) magnitude measurements if a reddening law with @xmath21 is assumed .",
    "in addition to direct measurements of @xmath0 using cluster members , there are several indirect measurements using individual stars in the sco - oph dust cloud complex with a line of sight close to m4 , which yield values of @xmath0 around 4 ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , some studies of m4 s colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) already use a non - standard , higher value of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite ( and later @xcite ) were among the first to use a value of @xmath22 for their distance estimate when determining the age of m4 from the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "however , this choice is solely based on the vague statements of @xcite , and @xcite who only estimate the value to be  around 4 . \" later , @xcite and @xcite follow the argumentation of richer and additionally use the results from @xcite , who found a value of @xmath22 for a star only one degree away from the line of sight of m4 to justify their choice",
    ". however , @xcite warns in his review about the properties of interstellar dust that  it is not possible to estimate @xmath0 quantitatively from the environment of a line of sight , \" since significant variations in the properties of dust can occur even on these small angular scales ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this value for @xmath0 is based on the measurement of only one star , using obsolete stellar models to estimate its atmospheric parameters .",
    "m4 is the closest gc to the sun .",
    "its closeness and low degree of crowding make the stellar population accessible to especially deep photometric and spectroscopic analyses .",
    "for example , m4 hosts one of the largest populations of identified white dwarfs ( wds ) , making it attractive for absolute age determinations and an excellent laboratory for testing stellar evolutionary theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has a significant population of rr  lyrae stars and it shows a bimodal hb , with well populated blue and red parts , making it an interesting object to study the so called  second parameter problem \" ( see e.g. the review by @xcite or some recent work by @xcite ) .",
    "there is clearly a need for a detailed investigation of the absolute reddening and the specific reddening law for m4 , providing more precise information about its dust type and the effects of spatial differential reddening across the cluster face . a better determination of the absolute photometric properties of m4 s stars  and consequently its distance  will increase the cluster s status as a most attractive target for astrophysical investigations .",
    "in this study we investigate the type of dust in the line of sight to m4 , as characterized by the appropriate value of @xmath0 assuming the validity of the general reddening law given in @xcite .",
    "we achieve high quantitative precision by using a combination of near infrared ( nir ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 and optical johnson - cousins @xmath25 photometry for the cluster m4 , supplemented with equivalent photometry for the cluster ngc 6723 with which we verify our models in unreddened conditions .",
    "we use the newest set of victoria - regina isochrones ( @xcite ) to determine colour excesses in filter combinations that are sensitive to the type of dust and consequently to the shape of the reddening law . to increase the precision of parameters such as distance , age and the absolute locus of the observed fiducial sequence , we map the variations in the reddening across the field of m4 that has been surveyed and then correct for those differential effects .    since extinction is a function of wavelength , the accurate extinction properties of our broadband filters depend upon the distribution of observed stellar flux within the passband . to minimize systematic errors in our extinction corrections and to the determined value of @xmath0",
    ", we investigate differential changes in the extinction properties of optical and nir filters and filter combinations appropriate for stars with different intrinsic spectral - energy distributions as determined by their temperature , surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "specifically , we consider whether a single reddening law is sufficient to determine cluster parameters from photometry , or whether a star - by - star correction is required to avoid significant systematic errors .",
    "these results are then used to define an object - specific reddening law for m4 where the correction zero points are tailored for the atmospheric and chemical parameters of this cluster instead of assuming a vega - like star , as is the case for most literature values . to test the consistency of the results obtained with synthetic and observed stellar fluxes we compare synthetic spectra from the atlas9 library ( @xcite ) to observational databases from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outcome of such a comparison not only constrains the validity of our results , but also reveals possible weak spots in the atmospheric models .    in  [ chapter_datareduction ] ,",
    "we summarize the data and the reduction process together with the criteria for choosing our high - quality photometric sample . our procedure for generating a reddening map for m4 and the spatial differential reddening corrections is explained in  [ chapter_diffred ] , while in  [ chapter_reddeninglaw ] , we investigate the effects of stellar temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and extinction on the shape of the reddening law and calculate an object - specific law tailored for m4 . finally , in  [ chapter_dusttype ] we characterize the dust type toward m4 , derive the cluster s absolute distance , and discuss random and systematic errors in detail .",
    "a summary is given in ",
    "[ chapter_summary ] .",
    "appendices provide fiducial sequences for m4 and ngc 6723 , and explicit extinction tables for a wide range of @xmath26 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath0 .",
    "for this work , we use near infrared @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath24 are used interchangeably where both refer to the 2mass bandpass . ] ground - based photometry for the globular clusters m4 ( ngc 6121 ) and ngc 6723 .",
    "the images for m4 were taken in 2002 with the large and small field of sofi , the infrared imaging camera on the new technology telescope of eso on cerro la silla in chile as part of the program 69.d-0604(a ) ( pi : zoccali ) and cover a field of @xmath27 . for ngc 6723",
    "the same telescope and instrumentation were used in 2005 as part of the program 075.d-0372 ( pi : ferraro ) .",
    "the pre - processing of the ccd images for both clusters included bad pixel masking , bias and dark frame subtraction , and flat - field corrections , as well as sky subtraction .",
    "we use the data reduction packages daophot ii ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and allframe ( @xcite ) and related routines to obtain the instrumental photometry for each cluster and transform it to the 2mass photometric system ( @xcite ) . since the data reduction process for our two clusters is very similar , we will describe this work in detail only for m4 as an example .    in total , 50 frames in each filter",
    "were taken with a main concentration on the central region of the cluster , which was observed 10 times , and one region outside the core , which was observed 20 times .",
    "the rest of the cluster is covered by only one exposure in each filter with slight overlap .    for the profile - fitting photometry",
    "we use a point spread function ( psf ) which varies quadratically with the position in the frame because the sofi large - field camera was not properly aligned , so that the images are radially elongated in the left part of each frame .",
    "this distortion affects a vertical strip of about 150 pixels and smoothly disappears toward the centre of the frame .",
    "later , we correct the residual spatial inhomogeneities to first order by applying a differential reddening correction ( see section [ chapter_diffred ] ) . the psf is calculated using a sample of bright , isolated program stars , uniformly distributed over the individual frames . although we have written a pipeline to process all frames through daophot and allframe automatically , we pick out the psf stars for each frame by eye to assure their quality and rule out blending .",
    "the same stars later serve as local standards to calibrate our instrumental photometry to the 2mass standard system .",
    "we use daomatch and daomaster to find positional transformation equations between the frames , accounting for differences in scale and rotation as well as transverse offsets .",
    "those equations are then used to match up stars between different frames in order to get a complete star list for our catalog .    to calibrate the frames among themselves , daogrow ( @xcite )",
    "is used to obtain the total integrated instrumental magnitudes ( i.e. , the total photon count ) for our standard stars by multiple aperture photometry .",
    "these total magnitudes are then calibrated by direct comparison to the published 2mass magnitudes for the same stars , as described in the next section .",
    "our instrumental photometry for m4 must be calibrated to the 2mass standard system : for accurate comparisons of our observed data to stellar evolutionary models , it is especially important that systematic deviations between instrumental and standard magnitudes are small .",
    "the same hand - selected , bright and isolated program stars used to determine the psf above now serve as local standards for our photometry . as an additional criterion , we only use stars below the 1% linearity limit of the detector ( @xmath28 ) , and only those that could be cross - identified with a 2mass standard star with a coordinate deviation less than @xmath29 . for m4 ,",
    "these comprise about 360 stars covering the whole observation field . since they are distributed homogeneously over the different frames , we are able to detect and compensate for photometric differences between different exposures as well as spatial inhomogeneities within individual fields .     and @xmath30 .",
    "only stars are shown that could be cross - identified with a 2mass star to within @xmath29 .",
    "the solid black line indicates a theoretical zero offset .",
    "stars used as local standards are viewed in black , grey dots indicate all other identified 2mass stars from our final high - quality sample ( see following paragraphs).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     to examine whether there are any trends with temperature.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    daomaster is then used to match up 2mass stars with corresponding local standards in our photometry .",
    "the equation that we use to transform the instrumental magnitudes ( @xmath31 ) to the standard system ( @xmath32 ) is of the general form @xmath33 and includes a zero - point correction ( @xmath34 ) , a term for atmospheric extinction ( @xmath35 ; with airmass @xmath36 ) , and a colour - sensitive term ( @xmath37 ) to account for differences in filter characteristics between the two systems . for our @xmath23 photometry",
    "we find @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . for the @xmath41 filter , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the correction coefficients for atmospheric extinction ( @xmath35 ) are a little low for @xmath23 and quiet high for @xmath41 , but since the variation in airmass within our individual frames is only 0.028 for both nir bandpasses , the impact on our photometry compared to `` standard '' assumptions of @xmath45 for each filter would only be in the order of @xmath46  mag and therefore negligible for our results .",
    "once the transformation equations to the standard system are defined for each filter with the standard star sample , they are applied to all of the stars in the cluster .    a comparison between our photometry and the 2mass standard system is shown in figures  [ n6121_consistency1 ] and [ n6121_consistency2 ] where the deviation between the two systems is plotted as a function of magnitude and colour .",
    "we find neither a significant zero - point offset between the two systems nor a clear trend with colour or magnitude , which would arise from insufficient correction of the different filter characteristics .",
    "the optical johnson - cousins photometry for m4 is a compilation of 4794 , primarily archival , images from 48 independent nights distributed among 11 different observing runs .",
    "the images were obtained between 1994 and 2007 with several different ground - based telescopes ranging from 0.9 m to 3.6 m , and were analyzed and calibrated as described in @xcite and @xcite . in total , the optical database covers a field of @xmath47 around the cluster centre , which is about four times the area that we cover with our nir photometry .",
    "the database consists of @xmath48 stars and the photometry reaches down to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we use daomaster to match up stars between the two photometric sets , where only stars are considered for which the coordinate deviation between the optical and the nir database is smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "the initial output of the photometry packages daophot and allframe yields a total of @xmath52 stars with photometric information in both @xmath23 and @xmath24 and in at least two of the optical bands .",
    "this sample still includes stars with high photometric errors , field stars in the line of sight to the actual gc system , and variable stars .",
    "since we are more interested in photometric precision than in completeness , a high - quality subsample ( hereafter : hq - sample ) was selected taking into consideration the aspects mentioned above .",
    "to select only stars with the best photometric standard errors , we have determined the 20-th percentile of standard errors in magnitude bins of @xmath53  mag straight line segments were then interpolated between these points to define a rejection criterion as a function of magnitude .",
    "this has been done for each filter individually to account for the different characteristics of each bandpass and the different observing conditions for each dataset .",
    "it is important to note that we do not automatically choose a lower boundary for brighter stars .",
    "a less strict boundary for hb stars has been applied so as to obtain a larger , more complete sample in this evolutionary stage and thereby to better to define the observed zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) luminosity , which is an important distance and age indicator for the cluster .",
    "furthermore , some pixels in the brightest stars occasionally exceed the saturation limit of the detector , which increases their observed photometric standard error . to produce a clear rgb sequence extending as far as possible towards brighter magnitudes",
    ", we applied a less strict photometric rejection limit for these stars , as well .    since the distribution of frames over the cluster field has an important impact on the final photometric standard error of a star ",
    "a large number of frames per observing field decreases the photometric error of stars therein  the final hq - sample is not distributed homogeneously over the field , but favours areas that have been observed most frequently ( see figure  [ hq_sample ] ) .",
    "a significant fraction of field stars can be a problem in the analysis of gc cmds , since they are not located on the evolutionary sequence of the population .",
    "therefore , they can smear the actual sequence and , in the worst case , lead to misinterpretations of observed features . by investigating our cmds of the whole cluster sample and comparing the total number of stars to those which",
    "clearly do not follow the common cluster sequence , it is clear that the fraction of field stars lying in the line of sight to the object is very small for the field of view of our observations . from this ratio",
    ", we infer the fraction of field stars to be @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we assume that field stars do not affect our photometric analysis .",
    "rr  lyrae stars have been identified by their coordinates from the most recently updated database of c. clement ( @xcite ; 2011 edition ) . only cross - identifications with a coordinate deviation of",
    "less than @xmath55 and only detections lying @xmath56 around the zahb @xmath57-band magnitude have been considered to be true rr  lyrae identifications . by these criteria ,",
    "35 rr  lyrae stars were identified in our sample , which are plotted in figure  [ hq cmds ] as black circles . except for a few outliers ,",
    "these stars fall very well in the predicted instability strip . for all rr  lyrae stars ,",
    "we adopt the allframe magnitudes from our photometry and not the mean magnitudes .        in our final hq - sample",
    ", the photometry reaches to well below the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) to a magnitude of @xmath58 in @xmath57 and @xmath59 in j. notably , it reaches below the ms knee visible only in nir photometry which is an interesting feature for the determination of the distances , and hence ages , of globular clusters ( see @xcite ) . at the luminous end ,",
    "the photometry is limited by the linearity limit of the nir data which lies at @xmath60 in @xmath57 and @xmath61 for the @xmath23 filter .",
    "@xmath62 . the apparent larger spread in colour showed by the nir filter combination",
    "is only caused by the smaller colour range covered by this cmd .",
    "the black bars indicate the length and direction of the reddening vector for each filter combination assuming @xmath63 and a standard reddening law with @xmath64.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in our photometry of m4 , both the hb and the rgb sequences are poorly defined ( seen as a large scatter in magnitude on the hb and a large scatter in colour along the rgb ) compared to the well defined subgiant branch ( sgb ) and ms . additionally , in cmds with a combination of optical and nir filters , the colour scatter of the ms increases with luminosity towards the to . considering only the photometric uncertainty , one would expect the result to be the opposite .",
    "furthermore , the scatter on the hb is much stronger in @xmath57 than it is in the @xmath23-band , suggesting that those effects are mainly caused by differential reddening instead of photometric errors .",
    "generally , differential reddening induces the stars to scatter much more around the actual sequence than would be expected from their photometric uncertainty .",
    "this additional scatter , however , is not uniformly evident throughout the gc fiducial sequence . in fact , it depends on the angle between the sequence and the reddening vector .",
    "regions of the cmd where this angle is large show a larger scatter than regions where the sequence and the reddening vector are almost parallel .",
    "the direction of the reddening vector depends upon the actual filters that are used and the extinction relation between these filters , defined by the reddening law . in figure  [ hq cmds ]",
    "we show the reddening vector for each individual filter combination using a standard reddening law with @xmath64 for purpose of illustration .",
    "note , that for m4 we expect a slightly different orientation of the reddening vector .",
    "the general idea for determining and correcting spatially differential reddening across the face of the cluster is to calculate for a sample of reference stars the distance from a fiducial sequence in a cmd as measured along the reddening vector . in theory",
    ", this displacement depends only upon the individual reddening of the star and is therefore directly correlated with its spatial location in the cluster field .",
    "now , the local reddening value defined by these reference stars can be provisionally applied to all program stars in their immediate neighbourhood ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such a correction for spatially differential effects in the photometry potentially includes a first - order correction for poor flat - fielding or spatially varying psfs within different frames as well , in case they were not modelled perfectly during the data reduction process ( as is likely the case for our photometry ) .",
    "our strategy for correcting differential reddening effects in m4 is a  method of closest neighbours , \" where the reddening displacement for each program star is determined as the median value among the closest 10 to 30 neighbours for which the residuals have been determined . with this approach ,",
    "we are able to assign a reddening value on a star - by - star basis , allowing for any arbitrary dust geometry .",
    "the resolution is automatically adjusted to the number density in a given area , determined by the neighbour with the largest distance which is used . obviously , this method smooths over , and is therefore insensitive to , reddening variations on any angular scale smaller than 36 times the typical angular separation between stars . in general , we adopt the method described by @xcite and implement only a few small changes .    in order to obtain the maximal discrimination between the effects of differential reddening and those due to photometric error , we use a @xmath57  vs.  @xmath65 cmd , which  besides the large dynamic range of this colour compared to its uncertainty  also provides another important advantage over other filter combinations . in general",
    ", the direction of the reddening vector in the cmd depends upon the value of @xmath0 that describes the reddening law .",
    "this filter combination , however , is highly insensitive to the reddening law due to the fact that the extinction in @xmath24 barely changes with the dust type .",
    "therefore the effect on both axes is dominated by the change in @xmath57 and almost cancels out , with the result that we are able to perform the reddening correction without knowing @xmath0 precisely at this point . to define the angle of the reddening vector",
    ", we use @xmath66 , assuming @xmath67 , but a standard assumption of 3.1 would only change the angle of the vector by less then 0.5 degree .    in addition to a reference star sample on the main sequence , we select a second sample along the rgb which is smaller in number but shows stronger sensitivity to spatial differential reddening because it is more nearly orthogonal to the reddening vector .",
    "since our data have low photometric uncertainty only for specific regions in the field of m4 , we exclude only stars with especially large uncertainties to be able to cover the majority of the surface area ( see table  [ reference criteria ] ) ."
