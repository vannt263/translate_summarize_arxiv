    "angular momentum loss accompanies mass loss due to the nova outbursts .      to take account of the angular momentum loss accompanying mass loss in nova outbursts ,",

    "we employ the code developed by marks & sarna ( 1998 ) ( hereafter ms98 ) , which utilizes the results of the theoretical novae calculations of prialnik & kovetz ( 1995 ) and kovetz & prialnik ( 1997 ) ( hereafter pk95 and kp97 ) . using this data",
    ", we are able to compute the value of @xmath33 , which we have previously had to assume as free parameter ( sarna , marks & smith 1996 ) . by interpolation from the data of pk95 and kp97 , at each time step , we use the white dwarf mass and the mass transfer rate to determine the nova characteristics : @xmath33 , amplitude of the outburst ( a ) , recurrence period ( @xmath34 ) , and chemical composition of the ejected material ( for more details see ms98 ) .",

    "livio & pringle ( 1998 ) proposed a model in which the accreted angular momentum is removed from the system during nova outbursts , as previously suggested by marks , sarna & prialnik ( 1997 ) .",

    "we assume a binary system in the same evolutionary stage as u sco , with components of 0.94 and 1.3@xmath37 and orbital period 1.23 d. the secondary has a radius 2.22  @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and the mass transfer rate from the secondary to white dwarf is @xmath40 .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s , i.e. , angular momentum losses associated with nova outbursts is about an order of magnitude greater than those from the magnetic stellar wind .      to calculate the re - accretion by the secondary of material ejected during nova outbursts , we assume that the mass of the material re - accreted ( @xmath43 ) is proportional to the mass of the material ejected by the white dwarf , such that    @xmath44    the constant of proportionality is the ratio of the cross - section area of the secondary star to the area of a sphere at radius @xmath45 from the white dwarf .",
    "we base this formula on the assumption that nova ejections are spherically symmetric , with ejection velocities large compared with the orbital velocity of the companion .    during nova outbursts ,",
    "matter which is re - accreted by the secondary changes significantly its chemical composition .",
    "we assume that during stable hydrogen shell burning , only angular momentum losses due to the magnetic stellar wind will be important .      in this phase ,",
    "two more processes change the total angular momentum and mass of the system : a strong optically thick wind , and frictional deposition of orbital energy into that wind .",
    "if we consider a carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarf accreting matter from a companion with solar composition , there exists a critical accretion rate above which the excess material is blown off in a strong wind .",
    "hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that because wind velocity is about 10 times higher than orbital velocity , the wind has the same specific angular momentum as the white dwarf .",
    "the corresponding loss rate is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the mass ratio and @xmath48 is the mass loss rate from the system .",
    "this mechanism will be very effective during strong optically thick wind .",
    "note also that during the wind phase , the relatively small specific angular momentum content of the wind tends to stabilize mass transfer ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ; li & van den heuvel 1997 ) .      during an optically thick wind phase ,",
    "the secondary star effectively orbits within the dense wind . due to the frictional deposition of orbital energy into the wind",
    ", the separation of the components will be decreased .",
    "livio , govarie & ritter ( 1991 ) estimated the change in the orbital angular momentum brought about by frictional angular momentum loss ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the ratio of the expansion velocity of the envelope at the position of the secondary to the orbital velocity of the secondary in the primary s frame of reference , @xmath45 is the separation of the system , and @xmath51 is the rate of mass flow past the secondary ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "hachisu , kato & nomoto ( 1996 ) estimated that @xmath52 .",
    "we define two critical mass accretion rates onto white dwarf . first ( warner 1995 ) :    @xmath53 ~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the critical accretion rate above which hydrogen shell burning is stable .",

    "( 5 ) , the mass of re - accreted material is proportional to the mass loss rate from the white dwarf ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we may estimate the characteristic time scales for each of angular momentum loss mechanisms during a strong wind phase .",
    "we find , for example , that such a wind occurs for a binary system with component masses 1.57 and 0.95 m@xmath60 , and an orbital period of 1.1  d. in such a system , the secondary has a radius of @xmath42.6 @xmath38 , @xmath33=0.4 , the mass transfer rate from the secondary to white dwarf is 1.05@xmath61 , @xmath62 , and u=10 .",

    "they showed that for @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 optically bright outbursts are obtained only for matter with he / h@xmath1211 by mass .",
    "their results are consistent with our sequences b and c where he / h are equal 0.47 and 0.98 , respectively . the large helium content observed in u sco",
    "must then be attributed to helium enrichment from the underlying white dwarf ( prialnik & livio 1995 ) .    according to kato ( 1996 ) , a supersoft component in uv spectrum",
    "is predicted to be observable about 10 days after the outburst . for the hydrogen - rich model ( he / h=0.1 ) the supersoft x - ray component",
    "is expected to rise until @xmath131 days after the outburst to a maximum luminosity of @xmath132 erg s@xmath79 @xmath133 . for the helium - rich model ( he / h = 2 )",
    ", the maximum luminosity is reached about 20 days after the optical outburst .",
    "the evolution of the x - ray luminosity could therefore give important evidence about the chemical composition of the accreted matter .",

    "1999 ) .      in ms98 , a grid of evolutionary sequences for @xmath134 and white dwarf initial masses from 0.8 to 1.2 m@xmath60 has been calculated . according to those calculations it is possible to produce a system like u sco ( for population i chemical composition ) , but only if the initial white dwarf mass is already very high ( @xmath135 ) . for the model with @xmath136 ,",
    "the system spends less than 1% of its semidetached evolution ( @xmath137 yr ) in the recurrent novae phase . for the rest of the time",
    ", the system evolves through fast novae and moderately fast novae phases .",
    "our recent calculations for @xmath138 show that systems with @xmath139 evolve towards the chandrasekhar limit ( supernovae ia ) .",
    "the system spends about 30% of its semidetached evolution ( @xmath140 yr ) in the recurrent nova phase . in the calculations described here , which begin with higher initial mass ratios and lower - mass white dwarfs , sequences b ( hydrogen - rich ) and c ( helium - rich ) both evolve through the recurrent novae phase , and spend in this phase 75% and 65%of their semidetached evolution , respectively ( see table 3 ) . in their final phases of semidetached evolution ,",
    "massive white dwarfs near the chandrasekhar limit are formed , but they never exceed this limit .",
    "we calculated several evolutionary sequences to reproduce the orbital and physical parameters of the recurrent novae of u sco - type .",
    "the results of these calculations can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) we find a new evolutionary channel for the formation of the u sco - type systems .",
    "we show that they may form from binaries with a low - mass c - o white dwarf as accretor if @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
