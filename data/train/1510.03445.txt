    "this new theorem extends the original theorem in that it considers @xmath4-iterates of @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath4 , however , it only pertains to _ simple _ closed curves . given a contraction of @xmath3 , we give an explicit algorithm for constructing a homotopy of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the contraction that we obtain is in fact an isotopy ( except for the final constant curve ) .",
    "the general structure of proof builds on the ideas in @xcite . as in that article",
    ", we prove the theorem by constructing a graph , and then examining the degree of that graph .",
    "in particular , we look at various ways of cutting each curve in our homotopy at self - intersection points and rejoining them to form collections of simple closed curves .",
    "these form the vertices of our graph .",
    "we join a pair of vertices by an edge if there are isotopies between the collections of simple closed curves represented by the vertices .",
    "we then argue that we can start at a vertex which corresponds to @xmath4 copies of @xmath2 and find a path in this graph to a point where the number of simple closed curves decreases .",
    "this implies that we have a contraction of one of the original curves which is isotopic to @xmath2 .",
    "this portion of the argument , as in @xcite , relies on euler s handshaking lemma from his famous solution of the knigsberg s bridges problem .",
    "this result can be viewed as an effective version of the fact that closed orientable @xmath1-dimensional manifolds have no torsion ; we can not find a simple closed curve which is more difficult to contract than the curve formed by traversing it @xmath4 times .    in the last section we present some related open problems .",
