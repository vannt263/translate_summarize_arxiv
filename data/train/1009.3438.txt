    "anderson localization@xcite as well as strong correlation effects due to interactions@xcite have been studied intensely for decades in solid state physics .",

    "recently , experiments with ultracold atoms in disordered lattices have opened an alternative route of investigation to gain a better understanding of this fundamental interplay.@xcite a high degree of tunability of the disorder and interaction strength is inherent to these experiments .",
    "three different ways of realizing disordered optical lattices have been proposed : i ) by loading an additional atomic species into the lattice and suppressing its mobility.@xcite thereby a binary disorder potential is realized due to the interatomic interaction ; ii ) by superimposing two laser beams with incommensurate frequencies,@xcite thereby generating a stationary quasi - periodic lattice ; iii ) by using an optical speckle field@xcite superimposed onto an optical lattice.@xcite    in general , particles in a disordered lattice are exposed to an on - site potential varying from site to site , which already gives rise to localization due to coherent backscattering.@xcite in tight - binding lattice models this randomness is termed diagonal disorder .",
    "additionally in a tight - binding description , the hopping amplitude between two lattice sites depends on the specific disorder potential as well , giving rise to off - diagonal disorder.@xcite a complete description of particles in a disordered lattice should incorporate both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder , i.e. random on - site energies and hopping disorder already in a single particle picture",

    "furthermore , it should incorporate diagonal and off - diagonal disorder and , last but not least , should be able to treat other experimental features , such as finite temperature and the presence of the harmonic trap . in the case of bosons ,",
    "there have been several theoretical works@xcite combining some of these requirements .",

    "realistic distributions for the hubbard parameters , calculated by s.  q.  zhou and d.  m.  ceperley,@xcite are used to describe the speckle disorder potential .    as our main result",
    "we find that the paramagnetic ground state phase diagram differs strongly from the phase diagram for pure diagonal box ( homogeneous ) disorder , as obtained within typical medium theory.@xcite in particular , the mott insulator and the anderson - mott insulator are not continuously connected in case of speckle disorder .",

    "<S> strongly correlated fermions in three- and two - dimensional optical lattices with experimentally realistic speckle disorder are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we extend and apply the statistical dynamical mean - field theory , which treats local correlations non - perturbatively , to incorporate on - site and hopping - type randomness on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> localization due to disorder is detected via the probability distribution function of the local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a complete paramagnetic ground state phase diagram for experimentally realistic parameters and find a strong suppression of the correlation - induced metal insulator transition due to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the anderson - mott and the mott insulator are not continuously connected due to the specific character of speckle disorder . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the effect of finite temperature on the single - particle spectral function . </S>"
