    "however , downstream particles that do manage to cross the shock into the upstream region do so with much flatter trajectories , as discussed above , and can receive large momentum boosts in a single shock crossing due to the shock s lorentz factor ( note the logarithmic scale in the top panel of fig .",

    "the shock structure must be smoothed and the overall compression ratio increased above the test - particle value . our computational scheme calculates this compression ratio and flux conserving profile and the result is the dashed curve in the top panel with the corresponding momentum and energy fluxes in the middle and bottom panels .",
    "the source of the non - conservation of momentum and energy is the efficient acceleration of particles by the sharp flow speed discontinuity .",
    "while the actual injection and acceleration efficiency depends on our particular pitch angle diffusion model , once our scattering assumptions are made , the kinematics determine the injection and acceleration of the particles without additional parameters . or the position of the feb , influence the acceleration efficiency , but these are `` environmental '' parameters rather than parameters needed to describe the plasma interactions .",
    "] of course it would have been possible to make assumptions which resulted in an acceleration efficiency low enough that momentum and energy are approximately conserved without significantly smoothing the shock structure or changing the compression ratio from the test - particle value .",
    "for example , we could have only allowed shocked particles above some lorentz factor @xmath146 to recross into the upstream region or arbitrarily restricted the number of particles that recrossed into the upstream to a small fraction , @xmath147 , of all downstream particles . by making @xmath147 low enough or @xmath146 high enough we could make the efficiency as low as we wanted . however , there are at least three reasons for not making such an assumption .",
    "the first is that restricting the acceleration efficiency requires additional parameters ( i.e. , @xmath146 and/or @xmath147 ) to those needed to describe pitch angle diffusion .",
    "the second is that models with _ inefficient _ acceleration will not help explain grbs ( or other objects ) that require high efficiencies . if relativistic  shocks are inefficient accelerators they are not very interesting .",
    "if they are efficient , they will have a qualitative resemblance to the results we show even if , as is likely , the actual plasma processes are far more complex than the simple model we use .",
    "a third , perhaps less compelling , reason is that identical scattering assumptions as used here have been used for some time in nonrelativistic  shocks and shown to match both spacecraft observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and hybrid plasma simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of collisionless shocks .",
    "the increase in compression ratio from @xmath148 to @xmath149 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profg2 ] comes about , in part , because the particles escaping at @xmath93 carry away momentum and energy fluxes which make the shocked plasma more compressible .",
    "this effect is countered to some degree by the fact that the self - consistent shock produces a downstream distribution with a smaller fraction of relativistic  particles than the unmodified shock so that the downstream adiabatic index @xmath150 .",
    "this tends to produce a smaller compression ratio .",
    "the escaping fluxes show up as a lowering of the dashed curves below the far upstream values , as shown in the bottom two panels of fig .",

    "the monte carlo techniques discussed here , which do not require @xmath211 , are well suited for the study of relativistic  shocks , and for any shock where nonlinear effects are important and the energetic particles originate as thermal particles in the unshocked plasma . except for computational limits , these techniques allow calculations of efficient particle acceleration in shocks of any lorentz factor .    as a check of our code",
    ", we have demonstrated that we obtain the well known , test - particle  power laws in fully nonrelativistic  and ultrarelativistic  parallel shocks ( figs .  [",
    "fig : gyro ] and [ fig : spectp ] ) . in trans - relativisticshocks , however , no such canonical results exist because the shock compression ratio , @xmath0 , depends on the upstream conditions in a nonlinear fashion , even for test - particle  shocks where all effects of accelerated particles are ignored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we show how @xmath0 , and the resulting power law spectral index , @xmath17 , vary through the trans - relativistic  regime in fig .",

    "it is likely that relativisticshocks are not test - particle  but inject and accelerate particles efficiently .",
    "the reason is that regardless of the ambient far upstream conditions , all particles that are over taken by an ultrarelativistic  shock will receive a large boosts in energy @xmath212 in their first shock crossing . thus , virtually all of the particles in the downstream region of an unmodified shock are strongly relativistic  with @xmath213 .",
    "the ability to overtake the shock from downstream and be further accelerated depends only on the particle speed ( eq .  [ eq : probret ] ) and the presence of magnetic waves or turbulence with sufficient power in wavelengths on the order of the particle gyroradii to isotropize the downstream distributions .",
    "it is generally assumed that the necessary magnetic turbulence is self - generated and if enough turbulence is generated to scatter high momentum particles ( with very low densities ) that constitute a test - particlepower law , there should be enough generated to isotropize lower momentum particles ( which carry the bulk of the density ) .",
    "if acceleration can occur at all , we believe it is likely to occur efficiently making it necessary to calculate the shock structure and particle acceleration self - consistently . furthermore ,",
    "if relativistic  shock theory is to be applied to gamma - ray bursts , where high conversion efficiencies are generally assumed , nonlinear effects must be calculated .",
    "when energetic particles are generated in sufficient numbers , the conservation of momentum and energy requires that their backpressure modify the shock structure .",
    "two basic effects occur : a precursor is formed when the upstream plasma is slowed by the backpressure of the accelerated particles and the overall compression ratio changes from the test - particle  value as a result of high energy particles escaping and/or a change in the shocked plasma s adiabatic index @xmath151 . as indicated by our @xmath167 example ( section 4.1 ) , mildly relativisticshocks act as nonrelativistic  ones showing a dramatic weakening of the subshock combined with a large increase in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profg2 ] ) .",
    "these changes result in a particle distribution which is both steeper than the test - particle  power law at low momenta and flatter at high momenta ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specg2 ] ) .    in faster shocks ( i.e. , @xmath188 ) , the initial test - particle  spectrum is steep enough that particle escape is unimportant so only changes in @xmath151 determine @xmath0 ( eq .  [ betasol ] ) .",
    "in contrast to nonrelativistic  shocks where the production of relativistic  particles causes the compression ratio to increase , we show that @xmath0 decreases smoothly to @xmath2 as @xmath31 increases and the fraction of fully relativistic  shocked particles approaches one ( fig .",

    "our most important result is that efficient , mildly relativistic  shocks do not produce particle spectra close to the so - called ` universal ' power law having @xmath214 .",
    "this may be important for the interpretation of gamma - ray bursts since the internal shocks assumed responsible for converting the bulk kinetic energy of the fireball into internal particle energy may be mildly relativistic  and the external shocks , believed responsible for producing gamma - ray burst afterglows , will always go through a mildly relativistic  phase ( see * ? ? ?",
