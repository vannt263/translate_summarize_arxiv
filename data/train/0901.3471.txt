    "the motivation for doing spectral analysis of stationary time series comes from the need to analyze the frequency content in the signal .",
    "the frequency content can for instance be described by the spectral density , defined below , for the process .",
    "one could be interested in looking for a few dominant frequencies or frequency regions , which correspond to multimodality in the spectral density .",
    "inference methods for multimodal spectral densities have been treated in @xcite , using the taut string method .",
    "a simpler problem is that of fitting a unimodal spectral density , i.e. the situation when there is only one dominant frequency , which can be known or unknown , corresponding to known or unknown mode , respectively , and leading to the problem of fitting a unimodal spectral density to the data . in this paper",
    "we treat unimodal spectral density estimation for known mode .",
    "a spectral density that is decreasing on @xmath0 $ ] is a model for the frequency content in the signal being ordered .",
    "a unimodal spectral density is a model for there being one major frequency component , with a decreasing amount of other frequency components seen as a function of the distance to the major frequency .    imposing monotonicity ( or unimodality )",
    "means that one imposes a nonparametric approach , since the set of monotone ( or unimodal ) spectral densities is infinite - dimensional .",
    "a parametric problem that is contained in our estimation problem is that of a power law spectrum , i.e. when one assumes that the spectral density decreases as a power function @xmath1 for @xmath2 , with unknown exponent @xmath3 .",
    "power law spectra seem to have important applications to physics , astronomy and medicine : four different application mentioned in @xcite are a ) fluctuations in the earth s rate of rotation cf .",
    "@xcite , b ) voltage fluctuations across cell membrane cf .",
    "@xcite , c ) time series of impedances of rock layers in boreholes cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and d ) x - ray time variability of galaxies cf .",
    "we propose to use a nonparametric approach as an alternative to the power law spectrum methods used in these applications .",
    "there are ( at least ) two reasons why this could make sense : firstly , the reason for using a power function e.g. to model the spectrum in the background radiation is ( at best ) a theoretical consideration exploiting physical theory and leading to the power function as a good approximation .",
    "however , this is a stronger model assumption to impose on the data than merely imposing monotonicity and thus one could imagine a wider range of situations that should be possible to analyze using our methods .",
    "secondly , fitting a power law spectral model to data consists of doing linear regression of the log periodogram ; if the data are not very well aligned along a straight line ( after a log - transformation ) this could influence the overall fit . a nonparametric approach , in which one assumes only monotonicity , is more robust against possible misfit .",
    "sometimes one assumes a piecewise power law spectrum , cf .",
    "@xcite , as a model .",
    "our methods are well adapted to these situations when the overall function behaviour is that of a decreasing function",
    ".    furthermore there seem to be instances in the litterature when a monotonically decreasing ( or monotonically increasing ) spectral density is both implicitly assumed as a model , and furthermore seems feasible : two examples in @xcite ( cf .",
    "e.g. figures 20 and 21 in @xcite ) are e ) the wind speed in a certain direction at a certain location measured every 0.025 second ( for which a decreasing spectral density seems to be feasible ) and f ) the daily record of how well an atomic clock keeps time on a day to day basis ( which seems to exhibit an increasing spectral density ) .",
    "the methods utilized in @xcite are smoothing of the periodogram .",
    "we propose to use an order - restricted estimator of the spectral density , and would like to claim that this is better adapted to the situations at hand .",
    "decreasing spectral densities can arise when one observes a sum of several parametric time series , for instance ar(1 ) processes with coefficient @xmath4 ; the interest of the non parametric method in that case is that one does not have to know how many ar(1 ) are summed up .",
    "another parametric example is an arfima(0,d,0 ) with @xmath5 , which has a decreasing spectral density , which is observed with added white noise , or even with added one ( or several ) ar(1 ) processes ; the resulting time series will have a decreasing spectral density .",
    "our methods are well adapted to this situation , and we will illustrate the nonparametric methods on simulated data from such parametric models .    the spectral measure of a weakly stationary process is the positive measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 $ ] characterized by the relation @xmath8 the spectral density , when it exists , is the density of @xmath6 with respect to lebesgue s measure .",
    "it is an even nonnegative integrable function on @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "define the spectral distribution function on @xmath7 $ ] by @xmath9 an estimate of the spectral density is given by the periodogram @xmath10 the spectral distribution function is estimated by the empirical spectral distribution function @xmath11 functional central limit theorems for @xmath12 have been established in @xcite and @xcite . however , since the derivative is not a smooth map , the properties of @xmath12 do not transfer to @xmath13 , and furthermore it is well known that the periodogram is not even a consistent estimate of the spectral density .",
    "the standard remedy for obtaining consistency is to use kernel smoothers .",
    "this however entails a bandwidth choice , which is somewhat ad hoc .",
    "the assumption of monotonicity allows for the construction of adaptive estimators that do not need a pre - specified bandwidth .    we will restrict our attention to the class of non increasing functions .",
    "let @xmath14 be the convex cone of integrable , monotone non increasing functions on @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "given a stationary sequence @xmath16 with spectral density @xmath17 , the goal is to estimate @xmath17 under the assumption that it lies in @xmath18 .",
    "we suggest two estimators , which are the @xmath19 orthogonal projections on the convex cone @xmath14 of the periodogram and of the log - periodogram , respectively .",
    "a.   the @xmath20 minimum distance estimate between the periodogram and @xmath14 is defined as @xmath21 with @xmath22 this estimator of the spectral density naturally yields a corresponding estimator @xmath23 of the spectral distribution function @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 b.   the @xmath20 minimum distance estimate between the log - periodogram ( often called the cepstrum ) and the `` logarithm of @xmath14 '' , is defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is euler s constant .",
    "to understand the occurence of the centering @xmath29 , recall that if @xmath30 is a gaussian white noise sequence with variance @xmath31 , then its spectral density is @xmath32 and the distribution of @xmath33 is a standard exponential ( i.e. one half of a chi - square with two degrees of freedom ) , and it is well known that if @xmath34 is a standard exponential , then @xmath35=-\\gamma$ ] and @xmath36 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the log - spectral density is of particular interest in the context of long range dependent time series , i.e. when the spectral density has a singularity at some frequency and might not be square integrable , though it is always integrable by definition .",
    "for instance , the spectral density of an arfima(0,@xmath37,0 ) process is @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "it is decreasing on @xmath15 $ ] for @xmath40 and not square integrable for @xmath41 . in this context , for technical reasons , we will take @xmath13 to be a step function changing value at the so - called fourier frequencies @xmath42 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : derivation ] we derive the algorithms for the estimators @xmath43 , @xmath23 and @xmath44 . in section  [ sec : lowerbound ] we derive a lower bound for the asymptotic local minimax risk in monotone spectral density estimation , and show that the rate is not faster than @xmath45 . in section  [ sec : limit - distr ]",
    "we derive the pointwise limit distributions for the proposed estimators . the limit distribution of @xmath43 ( suitably centered and normalized )",
    "is derived for a linear process .",
    "the asymptotic distribution is that of the slope of the least concave majorant at 0 of a quadratic function plus a two - sided brownian motion .",
    "up to constants , this distribution is the so - called chernoff s distribution , see @xcite , which turns up in many situations in monotone function estimation , see e.g. @xcite for monotone density estimation and @xcite for monotone regression function estimation .",
    "the limit distribution for @xmath44 is derived for a gaussian process , and is similar to the result for @xmath43 .",

    "the least concave majorant @xmath48 of @xmath46 and its derivative @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 by definition , @xmath51 for all @xmath52 $ ] and it is also clear that @xmath53 , @xmath54 . since @xmath48 is concave , it is everywhere left and right differentiable , @xmath49 as defined above coincides with the left derivative of @xmath48 and @xmath55 ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
