    "semiconductor surfaces are of huge importance especially in the modern era of nanoscience and nanotechnology . usually , a bulk terminated surface ( @xmath4 ) is unstable , will undergo a surface reconstruction and become a stable reconstructed surface phase ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "most of reconstructed surfaces transit to some @xmath4 structures at elevated temperatures .",
    "the si(001 ) and ge(001 ) reconstructed surfaces have been extensively studied because they are closely relevant to the modern computer technology @xcite . for both of them ,",
    "the reconstruction is realized through the forming of regular arrays of dimers in the top layer ( @xmath6 or dimerized phase ) , which has been confirmed by scanning - tunnelling - microscopy ( stm ) experiment @xcite .",
    "it was shown experimentally @xcite that when heated to certain temperatures , the @xmath6 reconstructed surfaces will transit to @xmath4 structures .",
    "there were some first - principles calculations for the local atomic configurations of the @xmath6 surfaces @xcite , but it is controversial even for the essence of the phase transitions @xcite .",
    "considering that a structural phase means an averaging of local atomic structures over large enough scales , the reconstructed surface phases need further clarification and the essential physics of the phase transitions are still unknown . a theory that can elucidate the issues is highly desirable .",
    "phase - field method is a reliable approach to modeling and simulating structural phases and dynamical phase transitions@xcite .",
    "it has been applied to various fields such as spiral surface growth @xcite , dendritic growth @xcite , alloy solidification @xcite , crystal nucleation @xcite , step - flow growth @xcite , epitaxial island growth @xcite , and surface phase transition dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , a phase - field - crystal approach was proposed to model the internal spatial structures of a given phase @xcite , and periodic lattices was obtained by solving evolution equations derived from the free energies .",
    "this powerful approach has been successfully used for natural modeling of elastic interactions @xcite and binary alloy solidification @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a phase - field - crystal model for the si(001 ) and ge(001 ) dimerized surface phases and their phase transitions .",
    "we use a two - dimensional ( 2d ) phase - field - crystal variable to describe the dimerization of atoms in the top layer , and determine the variable by solving an evolution equation derived from the free energy .",
    "our simulated morphology of periodic arrays of the dimerizarion variable is in good agreement with large - scale stm images of the si(001 ) and ge(001 ) surfaces in high - quality samples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we derive the temperature dependence of the dimerization parameter , and show that normal dimers and broken ones coexist between two characteristic temperatures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and a first - order phase transition takes place at a phase - transition temperature @xmath7 in between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these are in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "this phase - field - crystal approach can be applied to other reconstructed surface phases and their phase - transition dynamics .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we shall present our phase - field - crystal modeling for the 2@xmath01 phase and its phase transition dynamics during transiting to the 1@xmath01 phase . in section iii",
    "we shall present our main simulated results .",
    "in section iv we shall apply the model and the simulated results to the ( 2@xmath01)-(1@xmath01 ) phase transitions of si(001 ) and ge(001 ) dimerized surfaces . finally , we shall give our conclusion in section v.",
    "there are two kinds of the ( 001 ) surfaces , type-@xmath8 and type-@xmath9 , for both si and ge . they appear alternately in the vertical direction , but do not exist in the same layer in high - quality samples , although they can be changed into each other by a 90@xmath10 rotation @xcite . because the dimerization takes place only in the top layer , it is reasonable to describe both of the si(001 ) and ge(001 ) dimerized surface phases by a 2d model .",
    "we neglect the buckling of dimers without losing main physics because we are mainly interested in their high - temperature phase transitions to corresponding 1@xmath01 phases .",
    "we show the atomic configurations and corresponding phase - field - crystal modeling in fig .",
    "1 . we use @xmath11 for a 2d point , where @xmath12 describes the coordinate in the dimerization direction or the horizontal direction and @xmath13 in the other direction .",
    "the key order parameter is the dimerization - induced change of the bond length , @xmath14 , in the horizontal or @xmath12 direction because there is no dimerization in the other direction @xcite .",

    "the average value of @xmath15 over @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is set to zero for the dimerized surfaces .",
    "the variable @xmath15 for the dimerized surfaces is normalized so as to make the integration of @xmath20 over the 2d unit cell equal @xmath21 because there are two top - layer atoms in the 2d unit cell .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is identical to zero for the undimerized surfaces .",
    "these are enough for the following phase - field simulation , but , with all these in our mind , we can imagine that the morphology of the phase - field variable @xmath15 can be described approximately by a simple function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the lattice constant of the undimerized 2d unit cell and the center of the dimer is taken as the zero point of @xmath12 .    ) direction .",
