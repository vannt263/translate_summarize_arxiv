    "there are relatively few examples where the cutoff phenomenon has been rigorously confirmed .",

    "formally , the cheeger constant of a @xmath25-regular graph @xmath26 on @xmath27 vertices ( also referred to as the edge isoperimetric constant ) is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in @xmath30 .",

    ", peres@xcite observed that for any family of reversible markov chains , total - variation cutoff can only occur if the inverse spectral - gap has smaller order than the mixing time .",

    "it was shown by chen and saloff - coste @xcite that when measuring convergence in @xmath37-distance for @xmath38 this criterion does ensure cutoff , however the case @xmath39 ( cutoff in total - variation ) has proved to be significantly more complicated .",
    "there are known examples where the above condition does not imply cutoff ( see @xcite*section 6 ) , yet it was conjectured by peres to be sufficient in many natural families of chains ( e.g.  @xcite confirming this for birth - and - death chains ) .",
    "in particular , this was conjectured for the lazy random walk on bounded - degree transitive graphs .",

    "we now claim that the worst - case mixing time within any @xmath13 is attained by an initial vertex at distance @xmath289 from the root .",
    "fix @xmath290 , let @xmath241 be the initial vertex maximizing @xmath291 and recall that @xmath292 denotes its level in the graph .",
    "the combination of claim  [ clm - tau - ell ] and corollary  [ cor - mixing - top ] ensures that if @xmath293 then necessarily @xmath294 , in which case @xmath295 an immediate consequence of the requirement  [ eq - l - cond2 ] on @xmath61 is that @xmath296 , hence @xmath297 for any sufficiently large @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we can not have @xmath298 since by claim  [ clm - mix - bottom ] that would imply that @xmath299 contradicting the fact that @xmath241 achieves the worst - case mixing time .",
    "overall we deduce that for any @xmath13 we have @xmath300 thus confirming that the  on the above constructed family of @xmath62-regular expanders exhibits total - variation cutoff from a worst starting location .",
    "it remains to describe how our construction can be ( relatively easily ) modified to be @xmath41-regular rather than @xmath62-regular .",
    "the immediate step is to use binary trees instead of @xmath56-ary trees , after which we are left with the problem of embedding the explicit expanders @xmath53 and @xmath55 without increasing the degree .",
    "this will be achieved via the line - graphs of these expanders , hence our explicit expanders will now have slightly different parameters :    * @xmath53 : an explicit @xmath41-regular expander on @xmath301 vertices . *",
    "@xmath55 : an explicit @xmath41-regular expander on @xmath302 vertices .    recall that given a tree rooted at some vertex @xmath303 , denoted by @xmath304 , its edge - stretched version is obtained by replacing each edge by a @xmath66-path of length @xmath61 , and the collection of all new interior vertices ( due to subdivision of edges ) is denoted by @xmath305 .",
    "the modified construction is as follows :    1 .",
    "levels 0,1,2 : first levels of a binary tree .",
    "* denote by @xmath306 the vertices in level @xmath66 .",
    "levels @xmath67 : stretched binary trees rooted at @xmath68 : * connect vertices from @xmath307 ( interior vertices along @xmath66-paths ) to the corresponding ( isomorphic ) vertices in @xmath308 , i.e.  inter - connect the interior vertices via perfect matchings .",
    "* denote by @xmath78 the @xmath309 vertices in level @xmath80 .",
    "levels @xmath81 : edge - stretched binary trees rooted at @xmath78 and inter - connected via the line - graph of @xmath53 using auxiliary vertices : * associate each binary tree @xmath310 rooted at @xmath78 to an _ edge _ of @xmath53 .",
    "* for each @xmath311 ( interior vertex on a @xmath66-path ) we connect it to a new auxiliary vertex @xmath312 and associate @xmath312 with a unique edge of @xmath53 .",
    "* we say that @xmath313 and @xmath314 are isomorphic if the isomorphism from @xmath310 to @xmath315 maps @xmath241 to @xmath316 .",
    "add @xmath317 new auxiliary vertices per equivalence class of @xmath318 such isomorphic vertices , identify them with the vertices of @xmath53 and connect every new vertex @xmath319 to the auxiliary vertices @xmath320 representing the edges incident to it .",
    "levels @xmath90 : a forest of binary trees .",
    "last level : leaves are inter - connected via the line - graph of @xmath55 : * associate the @xmath321 vertices with the edges of @xmath55 . *",
    "add @xmath322 new auxiliary vertices , each connected to the leaves corresponding to edges that are incident to it in @xmath55 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the walk along the cross - edges of the @xmath323 s now corresponds to a lazy ( unbiased ) random walk on the edges of @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , the walk along the cross - edges connecting the leaves corresponds to the  on the edges of @xmath55 .",
    "hence , all of the original arguments remain valid in this modified setting for an appropriately chosen fixed @xmath61 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm-1 ] .",
    "the explicit cubic expanders with cutoff constructed in the previous section ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - expcons ] ) can be easily modified so that the  on them from a worst starting position would _ not _ exhibit total - variation cutoff .",
    "to do so , recall that in the above - described family of graphs , each vertex of the subset @xmath68 was the root of a regular tree of height @xmath70 whose edges were stretched into @xmath61-long @xmath66-paths ( see item  [ cons - part-1 ] of the construction ) .",
    "we now tweak this construction by stretching some of the edges into @xmath66-paths of length @xmath324 .",
    "namely , for subtrees rooted at the _ odd _ vertices in level @xmath325 of these trees we stretch the edges into paths of length @xmath326 . under this modified stretching the trees @xmath71",
    "are clearly still isomorphic , hence the cross edges are inter - connecting @xmath66-paths of the same lengths .    by the arguments above , starting from any level @xmath327 the mixing is faster compared to the root , and if @xmath328 is sufficiently small then the root remains the asymptotically worst starting position .",
    "however , starting from the root ( and in fact , starting from any level @xmath329 ) the hitting time to the set @xmath78 is no longer concentrated due to the odd / even choice of subtree at level @xmath325 .",
    "therefore , from the worst starting position we have that the hitting time to the leaves is concentrated on two distinct values ( differing by a fixed multiplicative constant ) , each with probability @xmath330 .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath331 is bounded away from @xmath121 and in particular this explicit family of expanders does not have total - variation cutoff .",
    "suppose @xmath269 is an explicit @xmath41-regular expander on @xmath332 vertices provided by theorem  [ thm-1 ] , and recall that the  on this graph exhibits cutoff at @xmath333 where @xmath334 is some absolute constant .",
    "our graph @xmath26 will be the result of replacing every edge of @xmath269 by the @xmath41-regular analogue of a @xmath66-path , which we refer to as a `` cylinder '' , illustrated in fig .  [ fig - expconsgen ] .",
    "the length of each cylinder is set to be @xmath335 satisfying @xmath336 . notice that the total number of vertices in @xmath26 is @xmath337 since @xmath338 and the  on @xmath269 , started at a worst - case starting position , traverses @xmath339 edges until mixing , we infer from clt , as well as the fact that the expected passage - time through an @xmath61-long cylinder is @xmath174 , that the analogous random walk on @xmath26 has cutoff at @xmath340 when @xmath341 we have @xmath36 . on the other extreme end , when @xmath61 grows arbitrarily fast as a function of @xmath332 we obtain that it approaches @xmath27 arbitrarily closely but we must still having @xmath342 since @xmath343 . in that case @xmath344",
    "approaches @xmath345 arbitrarily closely while having a strictly smaller order .    to complete the construction it remains to observe that we may choose @xmath61 and @xmath332 so that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this can be achieved by first selecting @xmath61 so that @xmath346 and then selecting a graph constructed through theorem  [ thm-1 ] on @xmath332 vertices for some @xmath347 ( note that in the theorem we construct graphs of size essentially @xmath348 so this is always possible ) .        to show that there is no cutoff whenever @xmath43 we will argue that in that case we have @xmath349 , in contrast to the necessary condition for cutoff @xmath350 due to peres ( cf .",
