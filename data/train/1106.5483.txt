    "since the discovery of the top quark at the tevatron@xcite , the top quark has played a special role in searching for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this can be attributed to the large mass of the top quark ( about @xmath4 ) , which is almost 40 times larger than the next heaviest quark .",
    "as the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath5 approaches to 1 , the top quark decays almost to a bottom quark and a w boson .",
    "its decay width @xcite is @xmath6 , much larger than the typical qcd scale @xmath7 , indicating that the top quark decay takes place before hadronization .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative effects are not important in the properties of the top quark , and one can perturbatively calculate its physical quantities precisely , such as top quark s spin correlation . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern",
    ", thousands of top quarks are expected to be produced per year at 14 tev .",
    "hence a new era in top quark research has arrived .    on the other hand ,",
    "very recently a dijet bump around 150 gev in the @xmath3 channel has been observed by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) at the tevatron@xcite , and it has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "there are some explanations within the standard model for this anomaly@xcite .",
    "some studies may indicate that single top production may play an important role in the cdf dijet excess .",
    "moreover , the d0 collaboration reported that their results were consistent with the standard model s prediction in the same channel@xcite .",
    "hence a careful investigation regarding the dijet in the single top production and decay is helpful . even without this cdf anomaly",
    ", it is still useful to study the dijet distribution in the top quark decay , as a part of investigations for the top quark properties .",
    "inspired by this , in the present study we will investigate the dijet mass distribution in the top quark decay .",
    "this work also aims at understanding the properties of top quarks .",
    "there are a lot of works already about top quark decays@xcite . generally , the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) radiative corrections to the top quark s width amount to about @xmath8@xcite , while the corrections of qcd two loops @xcite and electroweak one loop@xcite are about @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the nonvanishing @xmath11 effects @xcite and finite width corrections@xcite reduce the born level width by about @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "all these show that the qcd nlo corrections , among others , are important for top quarks .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we also put stress on the effects of qcd nlo corrections to the dijet distributions in the top quark decay .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section demonstrates the dimensional regularization schemes and @xmath2 schemes .",
    "section tackles our scheme - independent analytical expressions .",
    "jet algorithms are recalled in sec . and sec .",
    "discusses the results .",
    "the final section contains the conclusion .",
    "dimensional regularization has many advantages in dealing with ultraviolet , infrared and mass divergences encountered in high - order calculations in a unified manner . however , there are still some freedoms to handle these divergences in dimensional regularization . in this section",
    "we recall four modern versions of frequently used schemes and adopt the first three in the rest of this paper .",
    "the four schemes include the conventional dimensional regularization ( cdr ) , the t - hooft - veltman scheme ( hv)@xcite , the four dimensional helicity scheme ( fdh)@xcite , and the dimensional reduction scheme ( dr)@xcite .    in cdr ,",
    "only the @xmath14 dimensional metric tensor is introduced , i.e. @xmath15 . the loop momentum and the spins of vectors , regardless of whether they are `` observed '' or `` unobserved '' are in @xmath16 dimensions , whereas the spins of the spinor are in @xmath17 dimensions with @xmath18 . in this section ,",
    "the observed states refer to the external states appearing in the hard part of the process without any subsequent hadronization .",
    "we treat @xmath17 of fermions as four because it is distinct from @xmath16 and always appears as a global factor in computations .",
    "hv and fdh have many advantages in helicity amplitude calculations , while fdh and dr are two supersymmmetric preserving schemes@xcite .",
    "we describe the schemes in a unified way as explained below :    * to maintain the gauge invariance , all momentum integrals are integrated in @xmath16 dimensions . * the dimensions of all observed particles ( hard and noncollinear external particles ) are left in four dimensions . * the dimensions of all unobserved particles ( internal states and soft or collinear external states ) are treated in @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "any explicit factors of dimension arising from these state should be labeled as @xmath17 temporary ; these must be kept distinct from @xmath16 at the beginning .",
    "we treat internal states with @xmath19 in hv and fdh , whereas @xmath20 in dr , i.e. , all variables in @xmath16 dimensions can be divided into a four - dimensional part and @xmath21-dimensional part in cdr , hv and fdh , while a four - dimensional quantity can be split into @xmath16 and @xmath22-dimensional quantities in dr .",
    "the expressions are analytic functions of @xmath16 and they are continued to any desired regions . setting @xmath23 denoted in the above items ,",
    "we obtain the hv scheme , while setting @xmath24 results in the fdh and dr schemes . as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath17 arising from dimensions of spinor space is just a global factor .",
    "therefore , we can set this part of @xmath17 to be equal to 4 .",
    "all of the above is summarized in table [ tab : dim ] .",

    "is violated , i.e. @xmath33 .",

    "this will be used in the next section .",

    "this compromise recovers a correct anomaly as well .",
    "finally , we also introduce the renormalization constants and the splitting functions in the cdr , hv , and fdh dimensional regularization schemes used in this paper . in order to avoid calculating external self energy diagrams ,",
    "we choose the on - shell scheme for external legs .",
    "these constants are @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are on - shell(os ) wave function renormalization constants for top quark and light quarks , respectively , @xmath41 is the euler constant , and @xmath42 is only nonvanishing in fdh scheme . the unpolarized altarelli - parisi splitting functions @xcite parts and refs.@xcite were carefully discussed in ref.@xcite . ] to @xmath43 in hv and cdr schemes are all listed in the following : @xmath44 while in fdh and dr these terms should be @xmath45",
    "as emphasized in sec . , there are some degrees of freedom to regularize possible divergences .",
    "because of unitarity in qcd cross sections@xcite , we should expect the scheme independence of the well - defined physical results . in this section ,",
    "analytical results are provided for top quark decay and subsequent hadronic decay , thus affirming the simplicity of these processes .",
    "moreover , we also demonstrate that the off - shell effect in the top quark hadronic decay is small , and narrow - width - approximation is good enough at the decay width level .",
    "we first reproduce the well - known qcd corrections to the top quark decay@xcite(feynman diagrams generated by feynarts @xcite are shown in fig.[fig : graph1 ] ) . because of the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath47 , the branching ratio of @xmath46 is almost @xmath48 . for simplification",
