    "the two bright spiral galaxies ngc  55 and ngc  300 are both at the near side of the sculptor group and it has been suggested that ngc  55 and ngc  300 form a bound pair ( graham @xcite ; pritchet et al .",

    "the distance to ngc  300 is well determined via cepheids ( freedman et al .",

    "ngc  55 has remained without a reliable distance estimate .",
    "the observations were done with the wide field imager ( wfi ) on the 2.2-m telescope at the la silla observatory of the european southern observatory on the 4 and 5 july 1999 .",

    "ngc  55 was observed through the [ o  iii]/8 ( fwhm 80.34  ) and the off - band filter 518/16 , and the h@xmath4/7 filter for a total of 3120  sec , 1620  sec , and 3600  sec respectively . on the first day",
    "the galaxy was offset to the east and south by 3  to fill in the ccd gaps .",
    "the seeing was 14 .",
    "the esowfi external package in iraf was used to convert the eso headers to suit the mscred package and to set the instrument files and astrometry solution . next the reductions",
    "were done using the mscred mosaic reduction package in iraf according to the guide by valdes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we followed the survey technique as described in e.g. jacoby et al.@xcite and ciardullo et al . @xcite .",
    "the on- and off - band images were aligned .",
    "the off - band images were then scaled to the level of the on - band images and subtracted from them to produce the difference image .",
    "we identified the pne by blinking this difference image with the off - band image , and the h@xmath4+[n ii ] images . in order to discriminate pne from other emission - line sources",
    ", we used the following critieria ( feldmeier et al .",
    "@xcite ) : ( 1 ) pn candidates had to have a point - spread function ( psf ) consistent with that of a point source as all pne are expected to be unresolved at the distance of ngc  55 ; ( 2 ) pn candidates had to be invisible on the off - band image to exclude bright ob stars exciting h  ii regions ; and ( 3 ) pn candidates had to be significantly fainter in h@xmath4+[n ii ] image than [ o iii ] , in order to reduce further the possibility of contamination from h  ii regions .",
    "with all these constraints , only compact , h  ii regions that have high nebula excitation and faint central ob associations will have been mistaken for pne",
    ". however , even these will be faint and hence can not significantly affect the pnlf .",
    "in total we identified 21 candidate planetaries in ngc  55 .",
    "the pn candidates were measured photometrically in the off - band image using phot in iraf and flux calibrated using standard stars and the procedures outlined in jacoby et al .",
    "@xcite . in order to determine the filter transmission for the pne we need to take the redshift into account and the bandpass shift of the interference filter to the blue .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc  55 was taken to be 116  km / s ( puche & carignan @xcite ) . the percentage of transmission is about 88% across the filter for the [ o  iii ] line and about 87% for the h@xmath4 filter at the location of our objects .",
    "the difference in transmission across the field has negligible effect on the derived flux values and magnitudes .",
    "the resulting monochromatic [ o  iii ] flux values f@xmath5 were converted to [ o  iii]@xmath65007 magnitudes using ( jacoby @xcite ) :    @xmath7",
    "[ o  iii ] magnitudes were corrected for the interstellar extinction .",
    "we consider only the foreground galactic extinction towards ngc  55 and adopt e(b - v)@xmath10.013 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "identifications become incomplete beyond m@xmath5  @xmath1  23.5  mag . besides missing faint pne , the probability of overlap with a star or with an h  ii region increases towards the centre , particularly in the h@xmath4+[n  ii ] image .",
    "hence brighter pne than the ones recovered in the outskirts may have been missed towards the center .    from these data",
    "the pnlf distance to the galaxy can normally be derived by convolving the empirical model for the pnlf given by ciardullo et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath8\\ ] ] with the photometric error function and fitting the data to the resultant curve via the method of maximum likelihood .",
