    "they also offer the crucial advantages of studying binary systems at the same , well - determined distance , age , metallicity and reddening .",
    "accurate distances are particularly important for reducing uncertainties in luminosities , and making reliable cluster - to - cluster comparisons and cluster - to - field comparisons .    despite these promising goals ,",
    "observational progress in detecting globular cluster binaries was initially slow , mainly because of spatial resolution and sensitivity limitations .",
    "however , the superb imaging capabilities of _ chandra _  and _ hst _  has now resulted in the detection of large numbers of compact binaries in several globular clusters ( see grindlay et al .",

    "the cv periods and the absolute magnitudes determined in paper  i are compared with predictions for roche - lobe filling secondaries and are compared with cvs found in the field .",
    "time series for the active binaries are also presented here , with an emphasis on the variables not discussed by albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter agb01 ) .    the radial distribution ( radial offsets from cluster center ) of the cvs and active binaries discovered in paper  i are compared with the radial distribution of msps from freire et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and with the total stellar population , to test whether these distributions are consistent with the expectations of mass segregation .",
    "comparisons between the radial distributions of the x - ray detected active binaries and the larger sample of binaries discovered by agb01 are also made .",
    "other important diagnostics examined here are the x - ray luminosities and optical magnitudes .",
    "the flux ratio between the two was shown by richman ( 1996 ) and verbunt et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter vbr97 ) to be inversely proportional to the cv accretion rate ( for non - magnetic systems ) , and here we make detailed comparisons between the 47  tuc cvs and field cvs to help constrain the cv accretion rates in 47  tuc .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio is also useful in searching for additional quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) besides x5 and x7 ( ghe01a and heinke et al .",
    "we also discuss the x - ray luminosity and absolute magnitude distributions of the 47  tuc cvs and compare to field systems .",
    "the time series will be described in   [ sect.tseries ] , followed by an analysis section (   [ sect.anal ] ) , including a study of the radial distribution of the sources and their x - ray to optical flux ratios .",
    "this will be followed by the discussion in   [ sect.disc ] , and an interpretation of the results given in both papers  i and ii .",
    "paper  i discusses the photometric results for the optical ids ( including the cmds ) in detail .",
    "exquisite time series were produced in the @xmath0 and @xmath7 bands for the go-8267 dataset , and are analyzed in this paper .",
    "detailed simulations were carried out by agb01 , giving the recovery rate of simulated variables as a function of period , @xmath0-magnitude and signal amplitude for the pc1 and wf2 chips . for amplitudes of @xmath8(intensity)/intensity",
    "= 0.1 , the recovery rate for pc1 was @xmath6100% from the msto to @xmath0=23.5 for all input periods below 3.2 days , and for amplitudes of 0.01 the recovery rate fell from @xmath670% at @xmath0=20 to @xmath910% at @xmath0=21.5 ( agb01 ) .",
    "the wf2 recovery rates extend to slightly fainter magnitudes ( agb01 ) , but the generally higher crowding and saturation levels in the wf2 images counteract this gain , for variable searches .        for the cv candidates found in the go-8267 fov ( paper  i )",
    "we have analyzed the high quality time series produced by the planet and binary searches of gilliland et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and agb01 .",
    "time series were produced using difference image analysis combined with aperture and psf fitting photometry ( see gilliland et al . 2000 and agb01 for more details ) .",
    "the size of the region used in the photometry extractions was decreased to as small as one pixel in the cases where plausible x - ray ids were located near bright stars .",
    "least - squares fits to sinusoids and the lomb - scargle periodogram were then applied to search for periodic variations in the time series of the cv candidates .",

    "[ fig.w1 ] ) , although the @xmath0-band phase plot does show some evidence for asymmetry at a little less than the 3-@xmath11 level , arguing for the longer period .",
    "we can use equation ( 2.102 ) from warner ( 1995 ) to place limits on the absolute magnitude of the secondary :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the absolute magnitude of the secondary and @xmath14 is the orbital period measured in hours ( where 2 hr@xmath15 10 hr ) .",
    "this relationship is appropriate for field cvs of roughly solar metallicity . at fixed mass , stars with lower metallicity",
    "will have brighter secondaries ( stehle , kolb & ritter 1997 ) , and so equation  1 gives a lower limit to the luminosity of secondary stars in 47  tuc ( an upper limit to @xmath1 ) .",
    "for w1@xmath10  ( @xmath16 ) using a 5.78 hr period gives a limit of @xmath17 from equation  1 , while using a 2.89 hr period gives @xmath18 .",
    "the longer period is therefore favored unless the accretion disk completely dominates in the @xmath0-band .",
    "this may be possible if w1 is a non - magnetic nova - like cv , explaining the relatively blue @xmath19 color of w1@xmath10 . however , the @xmath2  value for this system is much more consistent with a magnetic cv or a dn system ( see fig .  [ fig.fxfopt ] ) , and a period of 2.89 hrs would be shorter than any of the ux uma systems given in fig .",
    "[ fig.permv]a , and all but one of the dq her systems .",
    "modeling of the accretion disk and secondary in this system may help determine which period is correct .",
    "note that both w8@xmath10  and w15@xmath10  are optically crowded and the absolute photometry in @xmath0 and @xmath7 is relatively poor ( an @xmath7 magnitude could not be self - consistently derived for w15@xmath10 ) .",
    "however , since this project was optimised for time series accuracy , the quality of the time series is much higher than that of the absolute photometry . both w8@xmath10  and",
    "w15@xmath10  are clearly eclipsing systems ( see fig .  [ fig.w8w15 ] ) , with unambiguous period determinations of 2.86 hr ( at the upper edge of the period gap for field cvs ) and 4.23 hr respectively .",
    "both of the associated x - ray sources for these cvs are very hard ( ghe01a ) .",
    "detection of these objects as eclipsing strongly supports the argument of ghe01a that self - absorption by the accretion disks are responsible for the hard spectra .",

    "the lack of strong signal at 104 minutes in the power spectrum and the large amplitude of the time series ( 0.28@xmath200.14 ) tentatively favor 52 minutes being the orbital period .",
    "poor phase coverage at phases 0.40.75 makes it difficult to distinguish between these two periods , although the phase plot does show suggestive evidence of asymmetry . in the 52 minute period case",
    "the secondary is possibly a degenerate star since 52 minutes is well below the canonical period minimum for field cvs of @xmath21 min , for non - degenerate secondaries .",
    "however , some field cvs with non - degenerate secondaries do have periods about this small ( e.g. a 59 minute orbital period for v485  cen ; augusteijn et al .",

    "( 2002b ) argue that this is not the result of an artifact showing up as a false signal at the _ hst_orbit .",

    "firstly , a uv - bright , relatively luminous component is probably required to cause measurable heating effects , but only 2v08 and 2v30 have @xmath27 colors that are comparable to those of the bluest cvs . secondly , because sinusoidal signals with low amplitudes ( either from heating or ellipsoidal variations ) are generally not detectable even in the brightest cvs because of noise from flickering .",

    "clearly , the 47  tuc cvs are significantly fainter in the optical than the nova - like cvs detected in the field , including the dq  her systems .",
    "since metal - poor secondaries are expected to be brighter than solar metallicity secondaries , at fixed mass , the difference in accretion luminosity between the 47  tuc cvs and field dq  hers will be even more dramatic than suggested by fig .",

    "2003 ) and @xmath2964 respectively .",
    "however , we caution that the _ chandra _  and go-8267 data were not obtained simultaneously , and since v3 is highly variable both optically ( see paper  i ) and in x - rays ( verbunt & hasinger 1998 ; ghe01a ) the high @xmath2  value derived here could be explained by a low optical state during the go-8267 observations , or a high state during the _ chandra _  observations .",

    "the only other reasonable candidate is w17 , a 103 ct source that is a factor of 3 fainter than the qlmxb in ngc  6397 .",
    "this source is outside the go-7503 fov and unfortunately lies in the middle of a large saturation trail in the go-8267 @xmath0 and @xmath7 images .",

    "the fainter two of these are comparable to the cvs w44@xmath10  and w45@xmath10  and the brighter one to a system intermediate between ako  9 and v1 .",
    "we set an upper limit to the detection of a star at the nominal w17 x - ray position ( ie assuming zero error in transforming to _ hst_coordinates ) of @xmath51 .",
    "this is suggestive of a faint optical counterpart like x5 ( edmonds et al .",
    "2002a ) or a faint upper limit as with the qlmxb in ngc  6397 ( ghe01b ) .",
    "other possibilities , besides a qlmxb , are that the source is a soft cv ( e.g. an am  her system ) or an active binary .",
    "however , for the latter possibility this source would be a factor of @xmath63 brighter than any of the soft ( and non - flaring ) active binaries .",
    "followup observations with acs should be useful in searching for optical counterparts and determining the nature of this source .",
    "as noted in paper  i , 1v36 may be a faint x - ray source ( @xmath3  @xmath52erg  s@xmath5 ) , arguing in favor of this object being a cv ( although edmonds et al .",
    "2001 and edmonds et al 2002b both give examples of faint x - ray sources with blue , variable optical counterparts that are msps , not cvs ) .",
    "much deeper _ chandra _  observations are required ( and have been taken ) to confirm this marginal detection of an x - ray source , but there are a number of arguments against the cv identification : ( 1 ) the period of 19.1 hr ( assuming the observed variations are ellipsoidal ) is too long ( see fig .  [ fig.permv ] ) .",
    "ellipsoidal variations should be seen in this low noise time series if the system is a cv and therefore roche - lobe filling ( unless the inclination is very low ) ; ( 2 ) the position of this star in the color - color plot is different from most known field and cluster cvs ; ( 3 ) the upper limit on @xmath2  for 1v36 is lower than that of all 47  tuc cvs ( see fig .  [ fig.fxfopt ] ) ; ( 4 ) there is no suggestion of the large flickering present in other optically bright cvs such as v1 , v2 and w25@xmath10 .",
    "note that ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) likely rule out the possibility that several ux  uma systems with very small @xmath2  values might have slipped beneath our x - ray detection limit .",
    "we therefore believe that the comprehensive data available for 1v36 does not support the claim by knigge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that 1v36 is a strong cv candidate and look forward to seeing what stis / fuv spectroscopy and variability says about this system .",
    "other explanations for 1v36 fare little better .",
    "the variable appears to be too faint and blue in @xmath19 to be a cluster blue straggler , and the star is much too bright to be a horizontal branch or blue straggler star in the smc .",

    "all of the other blue variables are uncrowded in the _ chandra _  image and consistent with non - detection , and their _ hst _",
    "time series show no evidence for flickering . as with 1v36",
    "this argues against them being cvs .",
    "here , we examine possible alternative explanations for these blue variables : ( a ) background variable stars from the smc ( e.g. rr lyraes ) , ( b ) detached wd binaries , ( c ) very low accretion rate cvs , like those discussed in townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) , and ( d ) exotic collision products",
    ". a combination of these may also apply .    considering possibility ( a )",
    ", we plot two smc rr lyraes ( labeled as r1 and r2 ) in the wf3 cmds of paper  i. these have periods of 15.2 hr and 8.7 hr and were independently discovered by two of the authors ( edmonds and gilliland ) using a ground - based variability study of a 47  tuc field off the core ( 14.5@xmath53 ; for background see sills et al .",
    "the rr lyrae light curves have a distinctive asymmetrical appearance that is clearly different from that of the blue variables .",
    "also , only 3v07 lies reasonably close to the expected position of the horizontal branch instability strip .",
    "a second possibility is that the variables are pulsating blue stragglers in the smc .",
    "these generally have shorter periods and smaller amplitudes than rr lyraes , for example the range of periods for the main pulsation modes of the 6 known sx phe stars in 47  tuc are 0.72.4 hr and the range of amplitudes is 0.006 - 0.085 mags ( gilliland et al .",
    "so , while the amplitudes overlap , most of the blue variables have periods that are too long . also , only 3v07 appears to lie reasonably close to the expected blue straggler sequence .",
    "consistent with these negative conclusions , we note that the number of blue smc stars above the msto in our field is likely to be very small judging by the detection of only 4 such stars in the study of a wfpc2 47  tuc field by zoccali et al .",
    "proper motion studies with separate f300w epochs may help confirm the blue variables as 47  tuc members .",
    "possibility ( b ) is attractive because fig .",
    "[ fig.permv]b shows that several of the blue variables have periods that are reasonably close to , but longer than , the values given by equation  [ eqt.warner ] for roche lobe filling . however , only 2v30 has colors that are obviously consistent with those of a ms star / carbon - oxygen ( co ) wd binary , and the long period for this system of 1.18 or 2.36 days is difficult to understand as either ellipsoidal variations or heating effects .",
    "the colors of 2v08 are very similar to those of a bright wd , so any ms companion is likely to be extremely faint .",
    "the other objects with all three colors available ( 1v36 , 3v07 , 4v05 and the possible i d for w71 ) , have colors , compared to the ms , that are bluer in @xmath19 than in @xmath27 , behavior that is difficult to reconcile with co wd - ms star binaries . however ,",
    "note from the color - color cmd given in paper  i that 3v07 lies very close to the he  wd companion to the msp 47  tuc  u , suggesting that 3v07 may also be a he  wd .",
    "this does not obviously have an msp companion , because of the lack of detected x - ray emission , but it could have a wd companion .",
    "case ( c ) appears to be an unlikely explanation because the stars are too bright to be consistent with the townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) models , and their colors are not obviously consistent with co wds . without having a satisfactory explanation for most of these stars , we turn to possibility ( d ) that at least some of them represent an exotic collision product formed near the center of 47  tuc .",
    "mathieu et al . (",
    "2002 ) point out , in their discussion of red stragglers in m67 , that stellar encounters are common in star clusters and that it would not be surprising to discover products of such encounters ( especially binaries ) that run counter to standard evolutionary theory of single stars .",
    "such expectations apply even more so to 47  tuc .",
    "we have discovered ( or confirmed ) optical counterparts for 22 _ chandra _  sources that are cv candidates as summarized in tables  3 and 4 of paper  i. we have included v3 in this list , but , as noted above , it may be a qlmxb . of these 22 cv candidates , definite variability of some type has been seen for all of them except w33@xmath10 , w45@xmath10 , w49@xmath10 , w70@xmath10 , w82@xmath10  and w85@xmath10 . the excellent astrometric match between w45 and w45@xmath10 , the tiny chance of this being a chance coincidence ( 0.012% ) and the relatively bright , hard nature of the x - ray source makes this i d secure .",
    "the other candidates have larger possibilities of being chance coincidences ( 0.8% , 1.0% , 1.4% , 2.3% and 0.2% ) and so without having independent information such as variability or an h@xmath54  excess there remains the possibility that one or even more of these 5 ids is not real . also , w70 , w82 and w85 are relatively soft soures ( fig .  [ fig.xcol ] ) and therefore one or two of them may be msps ( see   [ sect.alter ] ) . among the marginal candidates we believe that w140@xmath10  and w55@xmath10  have the greatest chances of being cvs , as explained in paper  i.    the photometric properties of these stars were summarized in paper  i. the other properties of these systems",
    "are summarized as : ( 1 ) the @xmath2values are higher , on average , than those of all classes of cv in the field sample of vbr97 , partly because of higher than average x - ray luminosities and partly because of faint optical magnitudes ; ( 2 ) the periods , where available , are generally consistent with expectations for roche lobe filling objects ; ( 3 ) the radial distributions are consistent with those of the cluster msps and the brightest ms - ms binaries , and therefore with wd - ms star binaries ; ( 4 ) three of the cvs are eclipsing ( w8 , w15 and ako  9 ) , several show significant flickering ( v1 , v2 , v3 , & w25@xmath10 ) , two of them have previously been seen in outburst ( v2 and ako  9 ) and several others show large amplitude variations ( e.g. w51@xmath10 , v3 , w56@xmath10 ) that may also be signs of outbursts .    the period/@xmath1  data presented in   [ sect.permv ] and",
    "the faint optical magnitudes presented in   [ sect.fxfopt ] , plus the apparent lack of non - magnetic novalike systems suggest that the 47  tuc cvs are dominated by low accretion rate cvs , i.e. dne , it is unlikely that qlmxbs , with their large @xmath2values , are significantly biasing our results , since based on x - ray spectral information and @xmath2  data , only v3 is a reasonable qlmxb candidate ] .",

    "( 1996 ) mention this possibility for 47  tuc . however , the outbursts seen for v2 and ako  9 , and the possible outbursts shown in paper  i ( the go-7503 variability ) do not appear to be as dramatic as those seen in su  uma systems , and the @xmath3  distributions of the 47  tuc cvs and field su  umas appear to be incompatible . also , all of the 47  tuc cvs except for w21@xmath10are found above the period gap , while nearly all known su  uma systems are found below the period gap .",
    "therefore , we believe it is unlikely that a significant fraction of the 47  tuc cvs are su  uma systems .",
    "selection effects in the field will almost certainly conspire against the detection of low accretion rate cvs ( warner 1995 ) . for example , nova - like systems are relaitvely bright and blue in the optical .",
    "conversely , su  uma systems like wz  sge are extremely faint at optical and x - ray wavelengths , and have very long recurrence times for outbursts . also , cvs found in the field have a range of non - uniform selection criteria .",
    "although cvs with very low accretion rates ( like those modeled in townsley & bildsten 2002 ) will be difficult to detect in 47  tuc , the sample of cluster cvs is likely to be relatively complete down to x - ray luminosities of 35@xmath55erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , given ( 1 ) the depth of our observations , ( 2 ) the uniform search methods used , and ( 3 ) that the 47  tuc cvs are effectively all at the same distance , it may be possible that our 47  tuc cvs are a more representative sample of cvs than the field objects of vbr97 , and that they therefore show an expected bias towards lower accretion rate systems .",
    "is the lower metallicity of 47  tuc compared to those found in field ( population  i ) cvs likely to result in lower accretion rates ?",
    "stehle , kolb , & ritter ( 1997 ) have studied the long - term evolution of cvs with low metallicity secondaries ( z=@xmath56 ) and have shown that such systems have a smaller period gap and a slightly higher mass transfer rate than cvs where the secondary has a solar composition .",
    "this trend therefore does not explain the low apparent accretion rates for the 47  tuc cvs .",
    "population synthesis modeling by stehle , kolb , & ritter ( 1997 ) shows that most population  ii cvs should be old enough to have already evolved beyond the period minimum , and will be extremely faint .",
    "however , this age effect does not explain the low accretion rates for the 47  tuc cvs , since the periods for the cluster cvs , where known , are nearly all above the period gap ( and most of the cvs with unknown periods should also be found above the period gap ) .",
    "a potential problem with the low accretion rate interpretation is that no known class of field cv has both @xmath3  and @xmath1  distributions that are similar to those of the 47  tuc cvs . as noted above",
    ", the x - ray luminosities of the 47  tuc cvs are much higher than those of the u  gem systems , and are consistent with those of dq  her systems .",
    "so , while the faint optical magnitudes imply that they have relatively low accretion rates , the high x - ray luminosities might imply that they have relatively high accretion rates .",
    "only one of these possibilities , at most , can be correct .",
    "since @xmath1  is clearly a better indicator of accretion rate than @xmath3  for non - magnetic cvs ( vbr97 ) , and @xmath1  is also known to strongly depend on accretion rate for magnetic systems ( e.g. hessman , g \" ansicke , & mattei 2000 and yi 1994 ) , we speculate that @xmath3  for the 47  tuc cvs is a poor guide to their accretion rates whether they are magnetic or non - magnetic systems .",
    "we note that two systems with presumably relatively low accretion rates are v2 ( a dn ) and w56@xmath10 , a possible dn .",
    "these are two of the brightest cvs in x - rays , with @xmath3@xmath57erg  s@xmath5  and @xmath58erg  s@xmath5  respectively , hinting that high x - ray luminosities are compatible with low accretion rates .",
    "we encourage theoretical work on globular cluster cvs to try to explain these results , and caution that the low accretion rate interpretation given here is not secure until the combined x - ray and optical luminosities are understood .    given the relatively high x - ray luminosities of the brightest cvs in 47  tuc and the observation that about 25% of field cvs are magnetic ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) , is it possible that most of the brighter cvs are dq  her systems ?",

    "the source w47 is probably returning from a flare , and x - ray variability in other sources such as w18 , w41 and w94 may also be signs of flares , explaining the relatively high luminosities even though these systems are likely by  dras .",

    "some of them could have x - ray variability that is intrinsically quite large , but is not detected because of the faintness of the sources .",
    "another possibility is that they are simply outliers in a large population of objects having a distribution that is similar to those found in the field .",
    "agb01 point out that large numbers of by  dras may have been missed in their study due to incompleteness , since the binary frequency determined from the by  dra sample ( with periods that are mostly a few days long ) is a factor of 17 smaller than that calculated from the shorter period eclipsing and contact binaries .",

    "there is a chance that some of the bright active binaries could be msps with low mass ( @xmath74m@xmath31 ) ms star companions that have been heated by x - rays so that they appear optically like msto stars or red stragglers , as may be occurring for 6397-a ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) . in principle the radial distribution of these objects",
    "could then mimic those of msto binaries , however , this would require a coincidence and would not explain an apparent absence of msp binaries with ms star companions having masses close to the turn - off value of @xmath60.85m@xmath31 .",
    "a second possibility is that binary - binary and binary - single star interactions resulting in dynamical kicks may cause the average msp - ms star binary to be further away from the center of the cluster than expected for mass segregation of such objects .",

    "the i d for w70 shows no evidence for periodic variation in our time series and only marginal evidence for non - periodic variations , but we do not yet have long - term variability information for this object . these sources could be cvs , since am  her systems for example are known to be soft x - ray sources ( vbr97 ) .",

    ". 1995 & cool et al .",
    "1998 ) and ngc  6752 ( bailyn et al .",

    "finally , we examine the soft , faint , apparently non - variable x - ray sources that have no plausible ( optically variable or photometrically unusual ) counterparts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig.xcmd]b ) .",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) listed the sources in this category , noting in particular the subset of these sources that fall in the go-8267 fov : w4 , w5 , w6 , w24 , w28 , & w98 ( we now add the source w71 to this list ) . as noted by grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) these sources include the leading candidates to be msps . by correcting for the incomplete spatial coverage of the wfpc2 go-8267 fov , and for incompleteness in the detection of radio - detected msps as soft x - ray sources , grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated the presence of at least 19 msps with @xmath3  @xmath77erg  s@xmath5  that do not have radio counterparts with timing positions , in addition to the 16 msps with such positions .",
    "this estimate obviously increases if some of the active binaries identified with soft sources are instead msps , but as argued above , few are expected . also , the estimate by grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) implicitly assumes that 2/9 of the msps have x - ray colors @xmath78 , so a small fraction of misidentified ` active binaries ' with harder x - ray colors ( like w9 or w59 ) that are really msps , do not change these statistics .",
    "based on a study of the optical data , is it reasonable that the 7 soft sources just discussed are all msps , rather than cvs or active binaries in some cases ?",
    "first , as already noted , w4 is a candidate red straggler and w24 may be an rs  cvn , and both of them have higher x - ray count levels than the brightest detected msp ( except for the hard x - ray source 47  tuc  w ) .",
    "also , w98 is located close to several giant stars so it may also be an rs  cvn . to estimate how many active binaries , or perhaps cvs , may have missed detection because of crowding , we have examined the stellar count levels present in the go-8267 data around the positions of the 7 soft sources .",
    "figure [ fig.testsky ] shows the mean stellar counts in an annulus ( between 09 and 135 ) around each : ( 1 ) cv , ( 2 ) bright active binary , ( 3 ) faint active binary ( 4 ) msp , ( 5 ) unidentified x - ray source , and ( 6 ) candidate msp ( the 7 sources discussed above ) .",
    "optical positions are used for ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) , radio positions for ( 4 ) and x - ray positions for ( 5 ) . the median count level for the candidate msps is higher than any of these other groups , and is 2.0 times larger than the median count level for the msps ( the two distributions differ at the 98.8% level using the ks - test ) .",
    "this suggests that some of the 7 soft sources are active binaries ( or cvs ) that have been missed because of crowding .",
    "we tentatively classify w4 , w24 and w98 as active binaries , based on their promixity to bright stars , and classify the 4 remaining sources as msps .",
    "this implies a population of 13 extra msps for a total of 29 msps with @xmath3  @xmath79 erg  s@xmath5 .      incorporating the optical identifications reported here and in paper  i ( plus radio / msp identifications from ghe01a and grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) and just considering the go-8267 fov alone ( where our high quality time series coverage is spatially complete ) a significant fraction of the 78 sources are active binaries ( 34.6% ) compared to 19.2% for cvs and 9.0% for msps , with the source w46/x7 being a qlmxb ( 1.3% ) .",
    "these sources , where x - ray colors are available , are labeled in the x - ray cmd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.xcmd ] . the remaining 27 ( 34.6% )",
    "sources in the go-8267 fov have uncertain identifications , or have no plausible i d . of these sources",
    ", we use the x - ray luminosity and color , or the plausible match - up with bright , blue or marginally variable stars to tentatively identify w10 , w16 , w17 , w20 , w32 , w35 , w37 and w140 as cvs , and w4 , w24 , w37 , w71 , w93 , w141 and w168 as active binaries leaving 13 faint sources that we identify as possible msps ( see table  [ tab.undet8267 ] ) .",
    "this leaves us with final fractions of 42.3% active binaries , 29.5% cvs and 26.9% msps ( plus the single qlmxb ) , although some of the 13 weak x - ray sources could be cvs or active binaries , lowering the msp number .",
    "the cv fraction is very similar to that calculated by ghe01a , but the active binary fraction is significantly higher than the 15% estimated by ghe01a .",
    "correspondingly , the msp estimate , and the one given in   [ sect.revised ] , are smaller than the value of @xmath650 msps originally presented for the 108 sources in ghe01a ( that estimate was based on incomplete analysis of the optical data ) .      based on the period/@xmath1  analysis and the @xmath1  distribution presented here ,",
    "the 47  tuc cvs appear to have lower accretion rates than field cvs systems found above the period gap",
    ". theoretical work on cv evolution predicts that the fainter , shorter period cvs expected to exist in 47  tuc ( but not observed because of crowding ) should have even lower accretion rates than the bright ones that we do observe ( see di stefano & rappaport 1994 and townsley & bildsten 2002 ) . the suggestive evidence for low accretion rates and dq  her type behavior in cvs in ngc  6397 , combined with : ( 1 ) the evidence for magnetic behavior in a couple of the 47  tuc cvs ( v1 and ako  9 ) and ( 2 ) the high ( dq  her - like ) x - ray luminosities of the 47  tuc cvs implies that magnetic activity may play an important role in globular cluster cvs .",
    "however , more work is needed to understand the unusual @xmath1  and @xmath3distributions for the cvs in both 47  tuc and ngc  6397 .",
    "perhaps the most unexpected result , when compared with other clusters , is that the active binaries outnumber the cvs . in ngc  6397 ,",
    "the detected cvs outnumber the active binaries by a factor of @xmath623 ( based on deeper _ chandra _  data than obtained for 47  tuc ) , but significant depletion of the ms binary population in ngc  6397 is likely to have occurred during and after core collapse . in ngc  6752 ,",
    "the detected cvs outnumber the active binaries by a factor of @xmath6410 , but the ngc  6752 _ chandra _  data is not as deep as the 47  tuc data , and several unidentified soft sources may still be identified with active binaries , given optical data of higher quality .    with this large population of detected active binaries in 47  tuc , many of them soft sources , we find support for the lower range given by grindlay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the number of msps in 47  tuc with @xmath3  @xmath80erg  s@xmath5(@xmath63040 ) .",
    "it is possible that a few of the active binaries may really be msps , and we continue to search for new objects that are similar to 47  tuc  u or 47  tuc  w , but , given the spatial , photometric , x - ray spectral and timing information available for the observed active binaries , a large population of msps masquerading as active binaries is unlikely .",
    "the lower estimated number of msps in 47  tuc means that the ratio between the number of msps and the number of cvs is smaller , and closer to the corresponding value found in ngc  6397 by ghe01b .",
    "a comparison of figures [ fig.fxfopt-ver ] and [ fig.fxfopt]a shows that we are sensitive to detection of most classes of cv except for the faintest dne ( su  umas ) , and possibly also double degenerate systems ( where the statistics are poor ) .",
    "there are good prospects for finding at least some of the fainter cv population not yet detected here by using the much deeper x - ray limits set by the 300  ks acis - s observation .",
    "although the gains will be limited near cluster center because of x - ray crowding , the faintest cvs should have low - mass companions of @xmath81m@xmath31 , and with wd masses of @xmath60.55m@xmath31  the total system masses should be less than or equal to the msto mass . therefore , many of these objects should be found in relatively uncrowded regions more than 20 - 30@xmath82 away from the cluster center .",
    "unfortunately , optical identifications will be difficult or impossible for many of these objects because of crowding and the high background levels present in the _ hst _",
    "images , a penalty for studying objects in this massive , concentrated globular cluster .",
    "the 300  ks followup _ chandra _  observations will provide much better quality spectral , timing and positional information , especially for the faintest sources discussed here , and these data should be very useful for distinguishing between msps and active binaries .",
    "many new , faint sources will also likely be discovered , dominated by msps and active binaries .",
    "new radio observations are obviously needed to search for the @xmath6200 undetected msps believed to exist in 47  tuc ( camilo et al . 2000 ) .",
