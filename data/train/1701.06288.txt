    "an anniversary is usually an opportunity to look back at the achievements of the jubilee . in helge",
    "s case the picture is impressive as he contributed significantly to several different areas of mathematical physics .",
    "nevertheless , one of his works made a much larger impact than any other , namely the monograph @xcite first published in 1988 .",
    "it is a collective work but helge s hand is unmistakably present in the exposition , and i add that it makes me proud to be a part of the second edition of this book .",
    "this also motivates me to choose a problem from this area as a topic of this paper .",
    "i am going to discuss operators of the type @xmath9 in @xmath2 , where the @xmath8-potential is supported by an infinite surface @xmath3 dividing the space into two regions , of which one is supposed to be convex , and @xmath4 is a potential bias being a positive constant in one of the regions and zero in the other . the question to be addressed concerns spectral properties of such operators , in particular , how they depend on the geometry of @xmath3 .",
    "we will observe similarities with recent results obtained in the two - dimensional analogue of the present problem @xcite , especially a peculiar asymmetry . on the other hand",
    ", however , it is not likely to have these results extended to higher dimensions , cf . a remark at the end of section  [ s : cone ] .",
    "let us begin with formulating the problem described above in proper terms .",
    "as we shall see , the geometry of @xmath3 will be decisive for spectral properties of the operator .",
    "we focus our attention on the following class of surfaces :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is topologically equivalent to a plane dividing @xmath10 into two regions such that one of them is convex .",
    "the trivial case of two halfspaces is excluded .",
    "2 .   @xmath3 may contain at most finite families @xmath11 of finite @xmath12 curves , which are either closed or have regular ends , and @xmath13 of points such that outside the set @xmath14 the surface is @xmath15 smooth admitting a parametrization with a uniformly elliptic metric tensor .    to distinguish the two regions we shall refer to the convex one as ` interior ' and",
    "denote it @xmath16 , the other will be ` exterior ' , denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "the curve finiteness in assumption ( b ) refers to the hausdorff distance , i.e. to the metric inherited from the ambient three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the assumption implies , in particular , that @xmath3 is @xmath15 smooth outside a compact .",
    "note also that the curves indicating the non - smooth parts of @xmath3 may in general touch or cross ; the regular ends mean that they can be prolonged locally without losing the @xmath12 property .",
    "since @xmath3 is by assumption topologically equivalent to a plane , we can use an atlas consisting of a single chart , in other words , a map @xmath18 provided we accept the licence that the fundamental forms and quantities derived from them may not exist at the points of @xmath14 , nevertheless , geodesic distances remain well defined across these singularities . furthermore , by assumption ( b ) the principal curvatures @xmath19 of @xmath3 are well defined outside a compact .",
    "we will suppose that    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is _ asymptotically planar _ , that is , the principal curvature vanish as the geodesic distance from a fixed point tends to infinity .",
    "equivalently one can require that both the gauss and mean curvatures given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , vanish asymptotically .",
    "we also assume that    1 .   there is a @xmath22 such that @xmath23 holds for any @xmath24 .",
    "this ensures , in particular , that there are no cusps at the points of @xmath14 where @xmath3 is not smooth ; in view of assumption ( a ) such a constant must satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "given a bounded potential @xmath4 , one can demonstrate in the same way as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) that under the stated assumptions the quadratic form @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 : = \\|\\nabla\\psi\\|^2 + ( \\psi , v\\psi ) -\\alpha \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^2 } |\\psi(\\sigma(s))|^2\\,g^{1/2}(s)\\ , \\mathrm{d}s_1\\ , \\mathrm{d}s_2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 are the coordinates used to parametrize @xmath3 and @xmath29 is the appropriate squared jacobian defined by means of the metric tensor @xmath30 , with the domain @xmath31 , is closed and below bounded .",
    "thus it is associated with a unique self - adjoint operator which we identify with @xmath32 of above .",
    "in fact such a claim is valid for a much wider class of potentials , however , we focus here our attention on a particular case . by hypothesis ( a ) above the surface",
    "@xmath3 splits @xmath10 into two regions , and we assume that    1 .",
    "@xmath33 in one of these regions and @xmath34 in the other .",
    "in the trivial case we have excluded the problem is solved easily by separation of variables .",
    "it is useful to look at the transverse part which we will need in the following .",
    "it is given by the operator @xmath35 where @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 otherwise , associated with the quadratic form @xmath39 defined on @xmath40 .",
    "properties of this operator are easily found ; we adopt without proof from @xcite the following simple results .",
    "[ prop - h ]    a.   @xmath41 .",
    "b.   the operator @xmath42 has no eigenvalues for @xmath43 . c.   the operator @xmath42 has a unique eigenvalue @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "d.   if @xmath46 the equation @xmath47 has a bounded weak solution @xmath48 .",
    "e.   for @xmath49 and any @xmath50 we have @xmath51    relations between the coupling constant and the potential bias will play an important role in the following . for the sake of brevity , we shall call the case ( iv ) of the lemma _",
    "critical _ , and similarly we shall use the terms _ subcritical _ for case ( iii ) and _ supercritical _ for the situation where @xmath52 .",
    "let us look first at the essential spectrum . as usual in the schrdinger operator theory it is determined by the behavior of the interaction at large distances .",
    "in view of assumption ( c ) we expect that asymptotically the situation approaches the trivial case with separated variables mentioned above , and indeed , we have the following result .",
    "[ spess ] @xmath53 holds under the assumptions ( a)(e ) , where @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 otherwise .",
    "the question about the existence of the discrete spectrum is more involved and the potential bias makes the answer distinctively asymmetric . in particular , a critical or supercritical potential supported in the _ exterior _ region prevents negative eigenvalues from existence .    [ ext - abs ] under the stated assumptions , suppose that @xmath57 holds in @xmath16 and @xmath58 in @xmath17 , then @xmath59 .    on the other hand , the operator may have isolated eigenvalues in the ( sub)critical regime as we are going to illustrate on examples . in section  [ s : cone ]",
    "we discuss the case of a conical surface and show that the discrete spectrum of @xmath60 is nonempty provided @xmath5 is small enough .",
    "the most interesting , though , is the _",
    "critical _ case , @xmath6 with the bias in the _ interior _ region . in section  [",
    "s : rooftop ] we discuss another example , this time with @xmath3 being a ` rooftop ' surface , and show that for suitable values of parameters we have here @xmath61 .",
    "the argument splits into two parts .",
    "first we shall demonstrate the implication @xmath62 to this goal , one has to find for any fixed @xmath63 and any @xmath64 an infinite - dimensional subspace @xmath65 such that @xmath66 holds for any @xmath67 .",
    "we denote @xmath68 and choose a pair of functions of unit @xmath69 norm , @xmath70 with the property that @xmath71 , and @xmath72 such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "such functions can always be found in view of the fact that the essential spectrum of the two - dimensional laplacian is @xmath75 and of the properties of the operator @xmath42 stated in lemma  [ prop - h ] .    in the next step",
    "we choose a sequence of surface points @xmath76 such that @xmath77 as @xmath78 . with each of them",
    "we associate the cartesian system of coordinates @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the cartesian coordinates in the tangential plane to @xmath3 at the point @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the distance from this tangential plane . by assumption ( b ) , the points @xmath81 can be always chosen in such a way that this coordinate choice makes sense .",
    "this allows us to define the functions @xmath83 . by construction ,",
    "each of them has a compact support of the diameter independent of @xmath84 , hence in view of assumption ( d ) one can pick them so that @xmath85 is simply connected . using then a straightforward telescopic estimate in combination with the requirement",
    "@xmath86 we get the inequality @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the tangential plane at @xmath81 and @xmath89 is the part of the function support squeezed between @xmath3 and @xmath88 ; the last term is understood as the @xmath69-norm over the two surface segments contained in the border of @xmath89 .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of are by construction bound by @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , in view of the assumptions ( a)(c ) in combination with the smoothness of the functions @xmath91 , which are the same for all the @xmath92 , the other two terms tend to zero as @xmath93 , hence @xmath94 holds for all @xmath84 large enough .",
    "in addition , one can always choose the points @xmath81 in such a way that @xmath95 holds for @xmath96 , which means that weyl s criterion hypothesis is satisfied .    to complete the proof of the theorem",
    ", we have to demonstrate the opposite implication , in other words , to check the validity of the relation @xmath97 which is equivalent to @xmath98 .",
    "while in the first part of the proof we have extended to the present case the argument used in the two - dimensional situation , now we choose a different approach because the localization estimates employed in @xcite become more involved here .",
    "we will need an auxiliary result which is a sort of modification of proposition  2.5 in @xcite .",
    "[ trans - est ] let @xmath99 denote the operator acting on the interval @xmath100 with neumann boundary conditions at the endpoints , associated with the form @xmath101 defined on @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 , there are positive @xmath104 such that for all @xmath105 we have @xmath106 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath52 holds , then @xmath107 for all @xmath108 large enough .",
    "we observe that the ground - state eigenfunction of @xmath99 corresponding the eigenvalue @xmath109 is of the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "since the function has to be continuous at @xmath113 and satisfy @xmath114 , we get the spectral condition @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 , the left - hand side is increasing from @xmath117 , behaving asymptotically as @xmath118 , the equation has a unique solution for any fixed @xmath119 provided @xmath103 . since the left - hand side is monotonous also with respect to @xmath108 we have @xmath120 where @xmath121 of lemma  [ prop - h](iii ) .    to get a lower bound we have to estimate the left - hand side of from below .",
    "we will do that using the rough bound @xmath122 .",
    "writing the solution of the appropriate estimating condition in the form @xmath123 we find after a short computation that @xmath124 holds as @xmath125 which together with the inequality @xmath126 yields the result .",
    "if @xmath52 no solution exists for a sufficiently small @xmath108 .",
    "the condition can be then modified replacing one or both hyperbolic tangents by the trigonometric one , however , we will not need it ; it is enough to note that the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath99  which certainly exists as @xmath99 as a sturm - liouville operator on a finite interval has a purely discrete spectrum  is positive for @xmath108 large enough .",
    "consider now the neighborhood @xmath127 of the surface .",
    "furthermore , fix a point @xmath128 and divide @xmath3 into two parts , @xmath129 consisting of the points the geodesic distance from @xmath130 is larger than @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "note that by assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) outside a compact @xmath3 has a well defined normal and the points of @xmath133 can be written as @xmath134 with @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the point satisfying @xmath137 ; for @xmath108 small enough this part of @xmath133 does not intersect itself , i.e. the point @xmath136 is unique .",

    "we also introduce the @xmath140 consisting of two connected components , so together we have @xmath141 .    using these notions",
    "we employ a bracketing argument .",
