    "as it was mentioned before , the maximum photon detection corresponds to nmr phonon minimum around @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , the quantum cooling is still efficient while increasing the temperature , i.e. @xmath16 . these behaviors can be understood also by taking into account that for certain positive laser - qubit frequency detunings the qubit population is mostly in the lower dressed - state @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the phonon generation processes are minimized while phonon absorption followed simultaneously by photon laser absorption processes are accompanied by photon emission in the cavity mode .",
    "therefore , the cavity maximum photon detection signifies also minimum of the vibrational quanta , that is , the cooling detection of the nmr vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "notice a small shift between photon maximum and phonon minimum detections for arbitrary larger qubit - cavity and qubit - nmr coupling strengths ( see , also , eq .",

    "the idea is based on correlating the vibrational degrees of freedom with those of a laser - pumped quantum dot when fixed on a nanomechanical beam while interacting with an optical resonator . more concretely , when the quantum dot dynamics is faster than the corresponding ones of other involved subsystems , one needs to adjust the laser frequency such that both photon laser and nmr phonon absorption processes are accompanied by photon emission in the resonator mode .",
