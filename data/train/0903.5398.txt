    "@xcite , there have recently appeared various lattice formulations of extended supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these lattice formulations is that at least one fermionic symmetry  @xmath3 , that is a linear combination of supersymmetry charges , is manifestly preserved even with finite lattice spacings .",
    "this could be possible , if @xmath3 is nilpotent and the continuum action @xmath4 is @xmath3-exact , @xmath5 .",
    "such @xmath3 is thus naturally identified with the brst supercharge in topological field theory  @xcite .",
    "in fact , formulations in  refs .",
    "@xcite start with a topological field theoretical representation of a target continuum theory . in lower - dimensional systems in particular , because of this exact fermionic symmetry  @xmath3 , one expects that the full supersymmetry is restored in the continuum limit without ( or with a little ) fine tuning .",
    "quite recently , this expectation on supersymmetry restoration was clearly confirmed  @xcite ( by means of a monte carlo simulation ) in a lattice formulation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) of  ref .",
    "@xcite .    from an extended supersymmetric theory",
    ", one can construct a topological field theory by a procedure called _ topological twist _ , that is to define a new rotational group ( the twisted rotation ) by a particular combination of the original spacetime rotation and an internal @xmath6-symmetry .",
    "the above brst charge  @xmath3 transforms as a scalar under the twisted rotation .",
    "however , if one does not regard the twisted rotation as a real spacetime rotation , as the standpoint we take here , the topological twist is nothing but simple relabeling of dynamical variables in the original supersymmetric action on a flat spacetime ; it thus does not change the physical content of the theory .",
    "this procedure is nevertheless useful to find the above @xmath3 transformation and a @xmath3-exact form of the action in the continuum theory .    in this paper",
    ", we present a lattice formulation of 2d @xmath0 @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd",
    "( sqcd ) with @xmath2 matter multiplets in the fundamental representation . for 2d @xmath0 theories ,",
    "there are two possible ways of topological twist .",
    "one is the so - called a  model twist , with which the twisted rotation is defined as a diagonal @xmath7 subgroup of the product of the original 2d rotation , @xmath8 , and the internal @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "another is the b  model twist , with which one takes the diagonal @xmath7 part of the product of the 2d rotation @xmath7 and the internal @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . for a different twist",
    ", a different combination of supercharges is regarded as the brst charge  @xmath3 . with our present standpoint , as noted above , these two twists are just different relabeling of dynamical variables and thus they are completely equivalent in continuum theory . @xmath1",
    "sqcd with @xmath2 fundamental matter multiplets , because the @xmath10 symmetry is anomalous in this system and consequently the twisted rotation becomes anomalous .",
    "the b  model twist of this system is completely legitimate in our present context because we do not regard the twisted rotation as a real spacetime rotation .",
    "] however , resulting lattice theories can differ and they have their own drawback and advantage . in this classification , lattice formulations of  refs .",
    "@xcite can be regarded as those based on the b  model twist ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while formulations of  refs .",
    "@xcite are regarded as those from the a  model twist .",
    "this classification in terms of the topological twist is sometimes very useful .",
    "for example , this explains why it was rather nontrivial to incorporate the superpotential in lattice formulations of  refs .",
    "@xcite ; they correspond to the b  model twist and , with the b  model twist , the holomorphic part of the superpotential can not be written as a @xmath3-exact form , although it is @xmath3-closed .    here",
    ", our intention is to provide a _",
    "simple _ lattice formulation of 2d @xmath0 @xmath1 sqcd with @xmath2 fundamental matter multiplets ( and no anti - fundamental multiplet ) by using compact gauge link variables on the 2d regular lattice . for this",
    ", we adopt the _",
    "b  model twist _ picture ; the point is the @xmath3-transformation law in the matter sector .    lattice formulations of 2d @xmath0 @xmath1 sqcd in  refs .  @xcite ( those also use compact gauge link variables ) are based on the a  model twist .",
    "with the a  model twist , the superpotential is @xmath3-exact and it is almost straightforward to incorporate the superpotential in the formulation ; this is an advantage of the a  model twist picture . however , as encountered in these references , it is rather tricky to avoid the species doubling in the matter sector with the a model twist . with the a model twist ,",
    "the @xmath3 transformation of chiral fields in the fundamental representation , for example , has a rather symmetrical structure as the @xmath3 transformation of anti - chiral fields in the _ anti - fundamental _ representation .",
    "see  eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) of  ref .",
    "@xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the wilson term introduced to lift the species doublers inevitably mixes the fundamental fermions ( their number is  @xmath11 ) and the anti - fundamental fermions ( their number is  @xmath12 ) as long as the wilson term is compatible with the @xmath3-symmetry .",
    "this forced one to take @xmath13 in  ref .",
    "@xcite in which the conventional wilson dirac operator was used . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , to remove the restriction  @xmath13 , the overlap dirac operator  @xcite was utilized on the analogy of a complete chirality separation  @xcite based on the ginsparg - wilson relation  @xcite .",
    "the construction in ref .",
    "@xcite is so far a unique lattice formulation of 2d @xmath0 sqcd with @xmath14 that can incorporate the superpotential .",
    "the use of the overlap dirac operator , however , requires the admissibility condition  @xcite on gauge link variables and imposition of the admissibility complicates the lattice action .",
    "of course , the implementation of the overlap dirac operator itself ( especially for odd @xmath11 or  @xmath12 ) is practically cumbersome .",
    "on the other hand , with the b  model twist , left- and right - handed components of the fundamental fermions are transformed in a symmetrical way under  @xmath3 ; see  eq .",
    "( [ twoxseven ] ) below .",
    "it is thus expected that we can separately treat the fundamental fermions from the anti - fundamental fermions while keeping @xmath3-invariance .",
    "this is the basic idea of this paper which allows a simple lattice action .",
    "however , with the b  model twist , the superpotential can not be expressed as a @xmath3-exact form and , quite unfortunately , we could not find a lattice discretization of the superpotential term that is invariant under our lattice @xmath3  transformation .",
    "this restricts the applicability of our lattice formulation .",
    "nevertheless , even without the superpotential , it is discussed that 2d @xmath0 @xmath1 sqcd with @xmath2 fundamental matter multiplets possesses rich physical contents .",
    "the low energy effective theory would be given by the grassmannian @xmath15 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model  @xcite , in which one expects the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xmath16 ( the @xmath10 symmetry is anomalous to be broken to @xmath17 ) and a dynamical generation of a mass gap  @xcite .",
    "it would be quite interesting to investigate these quantum phenomena by using monte carlo simulations on the basis of the present lattice formulation .",
