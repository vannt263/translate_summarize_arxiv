    "casimir interactions are the macroscopic response of the physical vacuum to the introduction of boundaries .",
    "they were first derived as an attractive force between perfectly conductive parallel plates induced by the zero - point motion of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "there is convincing experimental evidence for the reality of these forces @xcite and a vast body of literature dedicated to various aspects of the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the casimir interaction @xmath0 is the difference between the vacuum energy of the system constrained by the boundaries and that of free space .",
    "since boundaries made of real materials are transparent to sufficiently high - energy modes , the high - energy spectrum is unaffected by the geometry of the system , and only a finite range of the spectrum needs be considered @xcite .",
    "however , in the theoretical treatments of this effect the vacuum energies are usually calculated from an effective low - energy harmonic field theory ( such as quantum electrodynamics in the case of the electromagnetic casimir effect ) , so that they are approximated by the sum of zero - point energies of a collection of simple harmonic oscillators with a spectrum @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the speed of light ) . in this model ,",
    "the dispersion relation holds for arbitrarily large wave vectors @xmath3 ; both the `` constrained '' and `` free '' vacuum energy densities are ultraviolet divergent , and the casimir interaction is the difference between two infinite quantities .",
    "this problem can be resolved by a soft - cutoff modification of the large-*k * part of the spectrum that leads to a finite vacuum energy .",
    "when the result is not sensitive to the form of the cutoff , the casimir interaction can be extracted by taking the cutoff to infinity at the end of calculation .",
    "however , it is more common that there are contributions that diverge in the absence of a cutoff ; we will refer to these as `` formally divergent terms , '' since on physical grounds the casimir energy must be finite . some approaches to the calculation make use of analytic continuation @xcite or dimensional regularization @xcite to eliminate the formally divergent terms and extract the `` intrinsic '' part that is independent of the cutoff .",
    "the important virtue of the model is that for many geometries the various approaches give the same result for the intrinsic part of the casimir energy , that is independent of the cutoff and depends only on planck s constant @xmath4 , the speed of light @xmath2 , and macroscopic length scales .",
    "however , this is not always the case : in particular the divergences occurring for spherical geometry in even space dimensions are not removed by any regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "what this means physically represents an open problem ; it seems to imply that in two dimensions a conducting ring placed in vacuum is subject to an infinite stress . the two - dimensional version of this problem ( a circle ) was first studied by sen @xcite , who concluded that in addition to the expected cutoff - independent terms , the casimir energy contains contributions that depend on the cutoff .",
    "he further found that the formally divergent contributions can be interpreted geometrically .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze the formal divergences encountered in the casimir self - energy of an object with curved boundary .",
    "this is done by looking at the case of a massless scalar field theory with a dirichlet boundary and explicitly taking into consideration the invisibility of the boundary to sufficiently high - energy field modes .",
    "specifically we are guided by observation due to dowker and kennedy @xcite and deutsch and candelas @xcite that the formally divergent terms correspond to measurable effects , and that they can be understood and interpreted geometrically through the connection of the casimir problem to the weyl problem of the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the laplacian @xcite .",
    "this connection will be illustrated for several geometries by simultaneous solution of the casimir and weyl problems and showing that the weyl piece of the casimir effect corresponds to the formally divergent contributions .",
    "the cases for which it has not been possible to regularize the divergence are shown to belong to a separate class where the weyl piece of the casimir energy contains a contribution that is logarithmically dependent on the cutoff .",
    "we argue that this is what happens in even space dimensions and demonstrate our contention by detailed analysis of the casimir effect due to a smooth dirichlet boundary in two spatial dimensions . as by - products",
    "we resolve the problem of the divergent casimir force exerted on the ring in two dimensions @xcite and correct the sign of the coefficient of linear tension given previously @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce a new computational method in which the casimir effect is viewed as due to the vacuum fluctuations _ eliminated _ by introduction of the dirichlet boundaries .",
    "in section iii we review the relationship between the weyl problem of asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the laplacian and the casimir problem . as a motivation we calculate the formally divergent casimir energy of a single dirichlet plane ( section iiia ) and",
    "show how the latter can be understood geometrically in terms of the areal density of states ( dos ) of the weyl problem ( section iiib ) .",
    "for a field confined to a region the weyl dos is defined as a smooth part of the exact dos .",
    "since the weyl dos contains ultraviolet spectral information , it is natural to conjecture that the weyl dos is entirely responsible for the formally divergent parts of the casimir effect .",
    "this leads to a large wave vector expansion of the weyl dos .",
    "the weyl - casimir correspondence allows us to deduce the two leading terms of this expansion known as _ weyl s conjecture_. these ideas are illustrated in section iiic where we compute the casimir energies of a field confined to a one - dimensional interval with dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "additionally we demonstrate that the weyl piece of the casimir effect is insensitive to the topology of the problem ( whereas the intrinsic part is sensitive to this ) .",
    "the analysis of the same problem via the zeta - function regularization technique carried out in section iiid reveals that the weyl piece of the effect is usually discarded ( but possibly can be retrieved ) .",
    "one of the consequences of the separability of the weyl and intrinsic parts of the casimir effect discussed in section iiie is an expression for the weyl energy of the boundary as a surface integral of an even function of curvature invariants .",
    "for the special case of a spherical shell in general space dimension , this expression becomes a finite series in powers of the sphere radius .",
    "dimensional analysis of this series reveals the special role of even space dimensions as being cases where there is not a clear separation between the weyl and cutoff - independent pieces of the casimir energy .    in section",
    "iv we compute the casimir energy in two spatial dimensions due to an arbitrary smooth dirichlet boundary ; this contains the main results of our work .",
    "this is the case where regularization techniques fail to give a finite value for the casimir energy . as an illustration of this statement",
    "we show why the zeta - function regularization approach can not be successfully employed here .",
    "consistent with the observations made in section iiie , we demonstrate that even though the weyl - casimir correspondence continues to play a prominent role , we no longer have a clear cut separation of the cutoff - dependent and intrinsic parts of the casimir effect . our result is an expression for the casimir energy due to a smooth boundary , in the form of a sum of formally divergent terms coming from the weyl expansion , a geometrical term that is cutoff independent , and a non - geometrical intrinsic contribution .",
    "apart from the last term that can not be given in general form , the bulk of the effect has the form of a purely geometrical expression .",
    "the latter is deduced from analysis of a particular case ( a wedge bounded by an arc ) for the dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions ( sections iva and ivb , respectively ) that can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary curve . in section ivc",
    "these results are applied to compute the cutoff - independent difference in the casimir energies between the dirichlet and periodic geometries .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v. for all the cases considered in this work we correctly predict the sign of the effect , which is possible because we calculate the casimir energy in terms of the field modes eliminated by the dirichlet boundary .",
    "prediction of the sign of the casimir effect is an important fundamental problem whose general solution is yet to be found .",
    "the only rigorous result in this area is a proof @xcite that the casimir force between two arbitrarily shaped bodies related by reflection is always attractive .",
    "additionally , in the scalar case the sign of the effect can be estimated from the sign of the contribution due to shortest periodic rays @xcite .",
    "here we will explain how to calculate the change in energy resulting from the introduction of a dirichlet boundary into a quantum system at zero temperature . for technical reasons ,",
    "it is useful to first formulate the problem at finite temperature @xmath5 , and subsequently take the limit @xmath6 .",
    "the starting place is a gaussian field theory having the euclidean action @xmath7 = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\hbar / t } d\\tau d^{d}x \\left ( c^{-2}({\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\tau}})^{2 } + ( \\nabla w)^{2}\\right ) .\\ ] ] the real scalar @xmath8 is a function of the @xmath9-dimensional position vector @xmath10 and is periodic in imaginary time @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the scalar field theory ( [ action ] ) can be viewed as a toy version of electricity and magnetism .",
    "the divergences encountered for curved geometries exist in both theories , so they are not due to specifics of electricity and magnetism .",
    "therefore we study the problem in the simpler setting of the scalar theory .",
    "the zero - point energy can be calculated by means of a functional integral that makes use of the correspondence between the feynman path integral for the @xmath9-dimensional field theory and the partition function for a @xmath13-dimensional classical statistical mechanics problem .",
    "the path integral is @xmath14/\\hbar).\\ ] ] this resembles the partition function for a classical statistical mechanics problem , with the hamiltonian replaced by the action @xmath15 and the temperature replaced by planck s constant @xmath4 ( please note that this is distinct from the real temperature @xmath5 ) @xcite . in this analogy",
    "the energy for the quantum system corresponds to the `` free energy '' per unit `` length '' in the imaginary time direction , so that @xmath16 , and the zero - point energy is the @xmath6 limit of this .",
    "now assume that the vacuum is disturbed by the addition of sharp boundaries which constrain the field in some way and thus eliminate some degrees of freedom of the vacuum fluctuations . the constrained field ( which we will refer to as @xmath17 )",
    "inherits any boundary conditions imposed on @xmath8 as well as new conditions on surfaces @xmath18 of dirichlet ( @xmath19 ) type where the subscript @xmath20 labels the boundaries .",
    "we will write the difference between the original and constrained fields in the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 can be chosen to satisfy the @xmath23-dimensional equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 are functions defined on the boundaries and determined by the boundary values of @xmath8 ; they play the role of dynamical variables of our approach .",
    "the reason for defining @xmath26 this way is that it eliminates the cross term in the action , so that @xmath27 = s_{e}[v ] + s_{e}[u]$ ] .",
    "then the functional integral factors into integrations over @xmath17 and @xmath26 , so that @xmath28 . since the zero - point energy for the unconstrained system is determined by @xmath29 and the zero - point energy for the constrained system",
    "is determined by @xmath30 , the casimir energy is given by @xmath31 limit of @xmath32 .",
    "this result allows us to calculate directly the change in energy due to the fluctuation modes that have been eliminated .",
    "a simplification is achieved by expanding all the dynamical variables of the problem into a fourier series in the imaginary time domain ; for example @xmath33 where the fourier coefficients @xmath34 are solutions to the boundary - value problem for the helmholtz equation @xmath35    the calculation of the action @xmath36 $ ] is further simplified when the identity @xmath37 is substituted into eq.([action ] ) .",
    "then the integral of @xmath38 over @xmath39 transforms into a sum of surface integrals .",
    "the remaining integral over @xmath40 vanishes due to the relation @xmath41 and the condition of periodicity , @xmath42 . as a result",
    "we find @xmath43 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{\\hbar / t } d \\tau \\sum_{i}\\int[u\\nabla u]_{i}d\\textbf{s}_{i } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar}{2t}\\sum_{\\omega , i}\\int f_{\\omega , i}[\\nabla u_{-\\omega}]_{i } d\\textbf{s}_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath44_{i}$ ] stands for the discontinuity of @xmath45 across the @xmath20-th boundary , the summation is performed over all the boundaries and we employed continuity of the field @xmath46 at the dirichlet boundary .    although our approach is applicable to an arbitrary number of the dirichlet boundaries , in all the cases considered in this paper only one boundary contributes into the integral ( [ actionsurfaceintegral ] ) .",
    "since we are dealing with a harmonic field theory , the solution to the boundary - value problem ( [ helmholtz ] ) is linear in the surface field @xmath47 and thus the action @xmath15 is a quadratic diagonal form of @xmath47 : @xmath48 where the subscript @xmath49 ( representing one or more indices ) labels the normal modes of the field @xmath26 that have been eliminated by the boundary in question , and @xmath50 is a set of geometry - dependent coefficients . then according to the prescription outlined above ,",
    "the casimir energy is given by @xmath51 where in the second step we took the zero - temperature limit according to the rule @xmath52 . as was already mentioned , any physical boundary is invisible to high - energy modes and from now on this fact is made implicit by adding a prime to all pertinent sums and integrals over normal modes .",
    "this means that large energy contributions into the sum in ( [ casenergygeneral ] ) are suppressed by a smooth cutoff function that represents transmission properties of the boundary .",
    "we will not need an explicit form of the cutoff function .",
    "the constant in ( [ casenergygeneral ] ) is such as it cancels the temperature dependence and makes the argument of the logarithm dimensionless .",
    "rigorous determination of this constant requires an analysis of the functional integration measure in ( [ zdef ] ) that led to ( [ casenergygeneral ] ) .",
    "instead we provide a heuristic argument that gives the same answer .",
    "since in our approach the casimir effect arises due to harmonic field oscillators eliminated by the dirichlet boundary it would suffice to understand the case of one degree of freedom ( the harmonic oscillator ) and then the result can be generalized to that of the harmonic field theory ( [ action ] ) .",
    "let us consider a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath53 and natural frequency @xmath54 whose position is given by the displacement function @xmath55 .",

    "its high - frequency limit we obtain @xmath59 as it should be .",
    "a rigorous argument based on careful analysis of the functional integration measure leading from ( [ zpenergy ] ) to ( [ absolutezpenergy ] ) has been given by kleinert @xcite .",
    "in the casimir problem the confined field is represented by a collection of harmonic oscillators , and the same rule applied to eq.([casenergygeneral ] ) gives our final general expression for the casimir energy : @xmath60 the infinity in the argument of @xmath61 is not to be taken literally : in any problem the variable @xmath62 would enter via the dimensionless combination @xmath63 times a macroscopic length scale .",
    "the infinity means that the limit of this length scale going to infinity is to be taken so that the zero - point energy is the confinement energy relative to a reference free field geometry .",
    "our prescription ( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) agrees with that of brevik and elizalde @xcite employed in their calculation of the casimir energy of a piecewise uniform string .",
    "the rule ( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) guarantees that the integral over @xmath62 is ultraviolet convergent and that every field oscillator of frequency @xmath64 eliminated by the boundary contributes @xmath65 into the casimir energy . the second representation of ( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) ( where we integrated by parts ) hints at a relationship between our approach and the calculation of the casimir energy by means of a contour integral @xcite .",
    "we note that the integration variable @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) has its origin in the fourier transform in the imaginary time domain that led from eq.([gbvproblem ] ) to eq.([helmholtz ] ) .",
    "this auxiliary variable is not related to the physical frequency of a field oscillator and therefore it should not be subject to any large-@xmath62 cutoff . on the other hand , the mode index @xmath49 is a physical variable akin to a wave vector and thus it should be subject to a cutoff as a consequence of the penetrability of the boundary to high - energy modes .",
    "our cutoff rule is different from that employed by sen @xcite in his analysis of the circle geometry .",
    "expressed in our language , he imposes an exponential cutoff on the variable @xmath62 but leaves the mode variable @xmath49 unaffected .",
    "although his procedure gives a finite answer for the circular geometry , this would not be the case for the cylinder and many other geometries .",
    "on the other hand , our rule ( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) is universally applicable .",
    "let us assume that the physical boundary is characterized by a frequency cutoff at scale @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary is impenetrable to low - energy field modes but invisible to the modes of energy significantly greater than @xmath67 .",
    "such a boundary can be modeled by a dirichlet surface .",
    "we will determine the coefficient @xmath68 of the fluctuation - induced surface tension of a single dirichlet plane immersed in a @xmath9-dimensional vacuum .",
    "since this problem is only characterized by microscopic energy and length scales , @xmath67 and @xmath69 , respectively , the outcome can be estimated via dimensional analysis .",
    "indeed the only quantity having dimension of energy divided by length to the power @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",
    "we observe that the surface tension diverges as the cutoff frequency @xmath66 approaches infinity .",
    "this divergence has no effect on the casimir stress on parallel planes because the overall area of the boundaries remains fixed as the distance between the planes is varied .",
    "however this is not the case for curved boundaries .",
    "for example , a change of the radius of a circle implies a change of the perimeter and as a result the formally divergent self - energy will contribute to the casimir force per length .",
    "this idea , originally due to deutsch and candelas @xcite , was recently re - expressed by graham , jaffe and co - workers @xcite and by barton @xcite .",
    "the implication is that in an experimental situation , a curved boundary might give rise to a large cutoff - dependent contribution to the physically measurable casimir force @xcite ( if the boundary is not strictly rigid ) .",
    "this is consistent with sen s observation @xcite that the coefficients of the cutoff - dependent terms contributing to the casimir energy are geometrical objects such as the length of the circular boundary .",
    "we also note that in the high - temperature limit the casimir free energy is expressed in terms of a surface integral of a quadratic function of local curvature @xcite which can be shown to have entirely geometrical nature .    in order to better understand the geometrical meaning of the surface divergence we need to explicitly compute the casimir energy due to a dirichlet plane .",
    "this can be done by the method outlined in the previous section .",
    "let us consider single dirichlet plane perpendicular to the @xmath72-axis of the @xmath9-dimensional rectangular coordinate system . since the space is uniform relative to translations parallel to the boundary , both the fields @xmath34 and @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the position vector perpendicular to the @xmath72 axis ) can be expanded into a fourier series ; for example @xmath75 .",
    "the boundary - value problem ( [ helmholtz ] ) for the fourier coefficients @xmath76 becomes @xmath77 where we assumed that the plane is located at @xmath78 .",
    "the particular solution ( i.e. vanishing for @xmath79 ) to ( [ bvplane ] ) that decays as @xmath80 is @xmath81 substituting the fourier representations for @xmath34 and @xmath73 along with the solution ( [ planesolution ] ) in eq.([actionsurfaceintegral ] ) we find @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the macroscopic @xmath84-dimensional area of the boundary .",
    "the action ( [ actionplanar ] ) has the required form eq.([form ] ) , with the geometrical coefficient @xmath85 that becomes small for large @xmath86 . according to eq.([planesolution ] )",
    "the disturbance introduced by the fluctuating boundary condition is localized at the boundary , to within a length that is proportional to @xmath87 itself .",
    "this is the source of the divergent coefficient of the surface tension . substituting this @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ abscasimirenergy ] ) and integrating over @xmath62 we find @xmath88 the sum in ( [ surfaceenergysum ] ) can be recognized as the zero - point energy of a harmonic field confined to a @xmath70-dimensional space . by eliminating a range of the field modes ,",
    "the dirichlet boundary suppresses vacuum fluctuations in a region near it .",
    "this lowers the energy relative to the freely fluctuating vacuum , with the result that the casimir energy due to the dirichlet boundary ( [ surfaceenergysum ] ) is negative .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is a fraction of the @xmath70-dimensional zero - point energy because the surface energy is dominated by the field modes highly localized at the boundary ( without the cutoff this surface energy would be ultraviolet divergent ) .    for macroscopic area @xmath83 of the boundary the sum in ( [ surfaceenergysum ] )",
    "can be transformed into an integral with the result @xmath89 where in taking the macroscopic limit we used the rule @xmath90 .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is the surface area of a @xmath9-dimensional unit sphere , @xmath92 , divided by @xmath93 : @xmath94 we note that for @xmath95 the coefficient of surface tension is negative and given by @xmath96 which is in accordance with the dimensional argument given earlier . for a smooth curved dirichlet boundary , eq.([surfaceenergyintegral ] ) represents the leading term of a geometric expansion to be discussed in more detail below . for @xmath97",
    "the surface energy ( [ surfaceenergyintegral ] ) vanishes .",
    "this circumstance does not contradict our argument that introduction of the dirichlet surface lowers the vacuum energy .",
    "it just means that in one dimension the leading finite - size correction to the bulk vacuum energy is negative , cutoff - independent , and of the order @xmath98 divided by the system size .",
    "this correction term is the difference between the sum ( [ surfaceenergysum ] ) and the integral ( [ surfaceenergyintegral ] ) ; an explicit demonstration of this fact will be given below .",
    "although the surface energy is cutoff - dependent and determined by the transmission properties of the boundary , there is an intrinsic feature built into ( [ surfaceenergyintegral ] ) that can be revealed by rewriting the expression for the surface energy in a form that makes connection to its origin as a zero - point effect : @xmath99 where @xmath100 can be called the areal density of states ; it is a geometrical ( and therefore generally relevant ) quantity .",
    "this is an instance of a common feature , apparently first recognized by dowker and kennedy @xcite and by deutsch and candelas @xcite , and recently emphasized by schaden @xcite that _ all _ cutoff - dependent contributions into the casimir effect have a geometrical nature interpretable in terms of the dos .",
    "specifically , in the case of the scalar casimir effect considered in this paper , they all can be understood as having their origin in the asymptotic limit of the density of eigenvalues of the laplacian .",
    "the relationship to this classic problem of mathematical physics posed by lorentz , tackled by weyl and other researchers @xcite and made popular by kac @xcite can be summarized as follows :    the zero - point energy of the field confined to a region is the sum of zero - point energies of the field oscillators @xmath101 where @xmath102 are eigenvalues of the laplacian : @xmath103 the discrete eigenvalue spectrum is determined by imposing the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath104 at the boundary of the region .",
    "the function @xmath105 is the exact dos .",
    "it can be represented as a histogram with the distance between neighboring peaks of the order of the inverse of the system size .",
    "quite generally @xcite the exact density of eigenvalues can be presented as a sum of the smooth ( semi - classical ) part @xmath106 , commonly referred to as the weyl dos , and an oscillatory remainder @xmath107 .",
    "the weyl dos @xmath106 can be understood as the result of averaging of the exact dos ( [ exactdos ] ) over scales in @xmath108-space that exceed the distance between the neighboring peaks of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath106 contains information about the large-@xmath108 behavior of the exact dos , and the cutoff - dependent part of the casimir energy can be explained as having its origin in the weyl dos . likewise , the remainder @xmath107 is responsible for the intrinsic part of the zero - point energy .",
    "it is then expected that in the macroscopic limit the zero - point energy ( [ zpstandard ] ) naturally splits into cutoff - dependent and intrinsic pieces : @xmath110dq\\ ] ] in view of its ultraviolet ( local ) origin , the first cutoff - dependent term in ( [ splitzpenergy ] ) is _ additive _ , i.e. it can be presented as a sum of volume , surface , line etc .",
    "boundary integrals .",
    "this is however not the case for the second ( cutoff - independent ) term where we have taken the limit of infinite cutoff frequency ; requiring that the integral converges is a part of the definition of the weyl dos @xmath106 .",
    "the smooth part of the exact dos , @xmath106 , can be represented as a large-@xmath108 expansion and each term of this weyl expansion , similar to eq.([arealdos ] ) , can be interpreted geometrically .",
    "indeed , for a @xmath9-dimensional volume @xmath111 enclosed by a @xmath112-dimensional dirichlet boundary of area @xmath83 the weyl expansion starts out as @xmath113 where the first term is the well - known consequence of the transformation rule @xmath114 . for an infinite vacuum only the first term is present ; when this is the reference state the casimir energy can be calculated from eq.([splitzpenergy ] ) by removing the leading term from eq .",
    "( [ weyldos2terms ] ) .",
    "the second term , proportional to the area @xmath83 of the boundary , only includes the effects of modes inside the region and thus is half as large as ( [ arealdos ] ) where the boundary has two sides . for @xmath115",

    "the _ number _ of states @xmath116 has been given by brownell @xcite .    even though the weyl dos is a purely geometrical concept having little to do with physics , its relationship to the casimir problem explains the sign of the surface term in eq.([weyldos2terms ] ) .    a series of examples illustrating the general principles just outlined has been given by schaden @xcite .",
    "below we consider two one - dimensional geometries that illustrate the expectation ( [ splitzpenergy ] ) .",

    "this implies that @xmath109 averaged over the interval of length @xmath123 gives the weyl dos , @xmath124 .",

    "then the ultraviolet divergence present in the cutoff - free energy sum ( [ 1dzpenergy ] ) can be interpreted in terms of the riemann @xmath137-function @xcite @xmath138 which is convergent for @xmath139 and can be analytically continued to all complex @xmath140",

    "the cutoff - dependent term of eq.([1dzpenergysplit ] ) that is linear in @xmath117 seems to have been discarded .",
    "however , we observe that it is possible to retrieve the cutoff - dependent term from the zeta - regularized result as follows : the expression ( [ 1d_zeta ] ) has a pole at @xmath146 , which is between the range @xmath139 where the sum ( [ 1d_zeta ] ) is convergent and the value @xmath141 where we wish to evaluate ( [ 1d_zeta ] ) .",
    "we believe that in general there is a cutoff - dependent term associated with every such `` bypassed pole '' ; when the zeta - regularized expression is to be evaluated at @xmath141 and has a pole at @xmath147 with residue @xmath148 , the corresponding cutoff - dependent term has form @xmath149 with a coefficient that is proportional to @xmath148 . then the zeta - function regularization method would give an elegant route to the determination of all of the terms in the casimir energy .",

    "a natural consequence of the separability of the weyl and intrinsic pieces of the casimir energy is the conclusion that the weyl energy @xmath150 given by the first term of ( [ splitzpenergy ] ) can be expressed in the form of a purely geometrical expression . when the media on both sides of the boundary have the same speed of light ( so that locally the boundary can not distinguish the inside from the outside )",
    ", the weyl energy is given by a surface integral of an `` even '' combination of curvature invariants that does not depend on the sense of the local normal ( the contributions from the `` odd '' terms cancel ) .",
    "for example , for a smooth boundary in three dimensions @xmath150 has the form @xcite @xmath151 where @xmath68 is the coefficient of surface tension mentioned earlier while @xmath152 are the curvature stiffness constants and @xmath153 are the principal curvatures .",
    "since the boundary is made of real material , the shape coefficients @xmath154 have to be interpreted as contributions to the elastic constants of the boundary viewed as a flexible membrane . assuming locality , the energy expression ( [ membrane ] ) can be written down phenomenologically without referring to the weyl problem .",
    "the latter however puts ( [ membrane ] ) on a solid footing . like the coefficient of surface tension @xmath155 , the curvature stiffness constants @xmath152",

    "we also note that the geometrical expression ( [ membrane ] ) is applicable to an arbitrary harmonic theory and arbitrary boundary conditions ; however , the precise values of the stiffness constants @xmath160 s do depend on the nature of the field and type of boundary conditions .    for simple geometries",
    "the expression for the weyl energy ( [ membrane ] ) allows us to draw conclusions regarding whether the casimir self - stress experienced by the boundary is independent of the cutoff .",
    "indeed , the casimir energy for a spherical shell of radius @xmath161 is expected to have the form @xcite @xmath162 where the first two terms follow from ( [ membrane ] ) while the functional form of the last term is dictated by dimensional analysis ; the numerical prefactor @xmath163 is determined by the nature of the field involved and by the boundary conditions the shell imposes on the field . for the case of the electromagnetic field the coefficient of surface tension is known to be zero , @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "this means that the pressure on the boundary is independent of the cutoff and is correctly determined by regularization methods . at the same time it is clear that such a behavior is an exception rather the rule .",
    "indeed for the scalar casimir effect with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions the coefficient of surface tension is non - zero , and the casimir pressure is dominated by the first term of ( [ sphere ] ) .",

    "<S> the casimir self - energy of a boundary is ultraviolet - divergent . in many cases </S>",
    "<S> the divergences can be eliminated by methods such as zeta - function regularization or through physical arguments ( ultraviolet transparency of the boundary would provide a cutoff ) . using the example of a massless scalar field theory with a single dirichlet boundary we explore the relationship between such approaches , with the goal of better understanding the origin of the divergences . </S>",
    "<S> we are guided by the insight due to dowker and kennedy ( 1978 ) and deutsch and candelas ( 1979 ) , that the divergences represent measurable effects that can be interpreted with the aid of the theory of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the laplacian discussed by weyl . in many cases </S>",
    "<S> the casimir self - energy is the sum of cutoff - dependent ( weyl ) terms having geometrical origin , and an `` intrinsic '' term that is independent of the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the weyl terms make a measurable contribution to the physical situation even when regularization methods succeed in isolating the intrinsic part . </S>",
    "<S> regularization methods fail when the weyl terms and intrinsic parts of the casimir effect can not be clearly separated . specifically , we demonstrate that the casimir self - energy of a smooth boundary in two dimensions is a sum of two weyl terms ( exhibiting quadratic and logarithmic cutoff dependence ) , a geometrical term that is independent of cutoff , and a non - geometrical intrinsic term . as by - products </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the puzzle of the divergent casimir force on a ring and correct the sign of the coefficient of linear tension of the dirichlet line predicted in earlier treatments . </S>"
