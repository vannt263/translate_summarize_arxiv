    "forty years after first being discovered ( muller , oort , & raimond 1963 ) , the `` high - velocity clouds '' ( hvcs ) remain a mystery .",
    "hvcs are clouds of neutral hydrogen ( ) covering a large fraction of the entire sky with velocities inconsistent with simple galactic rotation and in excess of @xmath590  kms@xmath6  of the local standard of rest ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 for a review ) .",
    "in addition , they lack stellar emission ( e.g. simon & blitz 2002 ) .",
    "these facts make the determination of distances an intractable problem ; without distances we are unable to determine their masses and discriminate between mechanisms responsible for their origins .",
    "hvcs most likely represent a variety of phenomena .",
    "some hvcs are probably related to a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) and are located in the lower galactic halo .",
    "other hvcs are certainly tidal in origin : the magellanic stream is the most obvious of these features , formed via the tidal interactions between the milky way , large magellanic cloud , and small magellanic cloud ( e.g. putman et  al .",
    "1998 ) , with other hvcs potentially related to the sagittarius dwarf ( putman et  al .  2004 ) .",
    "some hvcs may even be satellites unto themselves ( e.g. lockman 2003 ) .",
    "oort ( 1966 , 1970 ) originally proposed that hvcs may be infalling primordial gas ; complex c may be such an example ( wakker et  al .",
    "1999 ; tripp et  al .  2003",
    "gibson et al .",
    "verschuur ( 1969 ) was the first to associate hvcs with the local group , with the idea resurrected by blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) for all hvcs and by braun & burton ( 1999 ) for the subset of compact hvcs ( chvcs ) .",
    "these authors suggested that hvcs contained dark matter and could be related to the small dark matter halos predicted to exist in large numbers by cold dark matter models of galaxy formation ( e.g. klypin et  al .  1999 ,",
    "moore et  al .",
    "1999 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "blitz et  al .",
    "and braun & burton hypothesize that hvcs have d@xmath71 mpc , and @xmath8@xmath710@xmath9@xmath3 .",
    "since these papers , much of the observational effort has focused on testing the association of chvcs with dark matter halos and the formation of the local group .",
    "in addition , distance and mass estimates have decreased ; de heij et  al .  ( 2002b ) suggested the chvc distribution has a gaussian distribution about the milky way and m31 with d@xmath7150 - 200 kpc and @xmath8@xmath710@xmath10@xmath3 , but are still associated with dark matter halos .    if the blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , braun & burton ( 1999 ) , and de heij et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) hypothesis is correct , then analogs to hvcs should be ubiquitous in other galaxy groups .",
    "numerous attempts to find extragalactic analogs to hvcs have been initiated , but , to date , there have been no discoveries .",
    "a few authors have reported high velocity gas around individual galaxies , but these hvcs are probably associated either with vigorous star formation ( e.g. schulman et  al .",
    "1994 , kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) or with tidal interactions ( e.g. kamphuis & briggs 1992 ) .",
    "pisano , wilcots , & liu ( 2002 ) searched for  clouds around 41 isolated , quiescent galaxies . while discovering 13 companions , all were dwarf galaxies .",
    "these studies all assumed that hvcs were associated with individual galaxies , while they may instead be unique to the group environment .",
    "lo & sargent ( 1979 ) conducted one of the earliest searches for intergalactic hi in three loose groups .",
    "they detected four dwarf galaxies , but lacked the sensitivity to detect hvc analogs . over the typical fwhm of a chvc ( @xmath730  kms@xmath6 ) their 5@xmath11 sensitivity was 4@xmath110@xmath9 - 5@xmath110@xmath4@xmath3 .",
    "a more recent survey of one of the same groups , canes venatici i , by kraan - korteweg et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) had a detection limit of @xmath710@xmath4@xmath3and also failed to find anything more than typical dwarf galaxies .",
    "other studies of groups , such as those by zwaan & briggs ( 2000 ) , zwaan ( 2001 ) , and de blok et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , only probed a small fraction of their total area reducing the probability of detecting analogs .",
    "in addition , these surveys did not explore spiral - rich groups akin to the local group .",
    "the most sensitive group survey to date is the parkes hideep survey ( minchin et  al .",
    "2003 ) which covered part of the cen a group . despite their 5@xmath11 @xmath8  detection limit of 2@xmath110@xmath12@xmath3  over 30",
    "kms@xmath6  at the distance of cen a (= 3.5 mpc ; cot et  al .",
    "1997 ) , minchin et  al .  found no sources without optical counterparts ; i.e. no hvc analogs .    despite the large number of searches for hvcs",
    ", all these studies have crucial limitations .",
    "some lack the sensitivity to detect hvc analogs and others only surveyed a small region of the group reducing the number of expected detections .",
    "perhaps most critically , however , is the lack of observations of groups like the local group .",
    "the cen a group , for example , is a fairly dense group centered around a large elliptical galaxy , quite unlike the local group .",
    "if hvcs are unique to the relatively tame environment of the local group , then we may not expect to see them in the cen a group or groups like it .    in this letter ,",
    "we present our observations of three loose groups of galaxies analogous to the local group with the parkes multibeam and australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and discuss the implications for the location of hvcs around the milky way . in section  [ obs ] we discuss the group properties and our observations . in section  [ model ] , we describe a model for the distribution of hvcs in the local group and its predictions for what we should see in our sample of groups .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ disc ] by comparing our observations with the model prediction and what this implies for hvcs in the local group .",
    "we chose to observe three loose groups of galaxies which were qualitatively similar to the local group : lgg 93 , lgg 180 , and lgg 478 ( garcia 1993 ) .",
    "these groups were selected to contain only large spiral galaxies which were typically separated by @xmath13100 kpc and spread over a diameter of @xmath71 mpc .",
    "all of the groups are nearby , between 10.6 and 13.4 mpc . at this distance",
    ", the parkes beam of 14.4@xmath14 corresponds to a linear size of @xmath745 kpc . between october 2001 and august 2002",
    ", we observed an area of @xmath71 mpc@xmath1525 square degrees over a velocity range of @xmath16 1500  kms@xmath6  centered on each group by scanning the multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope down to an rms sensitivity of 6 - 9 mjy beam@xmath6 per channel .",
    "this translates to an rms mass sensitivity of @xmath010@xmath12@xmath3  per 3.3  kms@xmath6 .",
    "fake sources were inserted into the cubes , and multiple double - blind searches for all real and fake sources were conducted .",
    "all sources , not just new ones , identified by more than one search were confirmed with follow - up observations using the atca . based on our identification of the fake sources",
    ", we determined that we detected all sources which had an integrated flux greater than 10 times the rms noise times the square root of the number of channels .",
    "this means that over a velocity width of @xmath735  kms@xmath6   ( the average fwhm velocity width of chvcs ) , we can only detect sources in our parkes and atca data with @xmath8  @xmath1310@xmath9@xmath3 .",
    "more detail on the groups , observations , reductions , and analysis will be presented in pisano et  al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the properties of the groups and the observations are listed in table  [ groups ] .    in the three groups , all the known members",
    "were detected and eight new -rich dwarf galaxies were found with optical counterparts visible on the digital sky survey or cataloged in ned ; no  clouds without stars were discovered . in other words ,",
    "no hvc analogs were found with @xmath8   @xmath1310@xmath9@xmath3 . at the distance of these groups ,",
    "the parkes beam is 45 - 55 kpc , but since our higher spatial resolution atca observations have the same sensitivity as the parkes data we should detect any massive hvc analog that is more than @xmath7 5 kpc from a galaxy .",
    "because we did not detect any hvc analogs in the three groups surveyed , we are unable to directly measure the masses and spatial distributions of such clouds . since these three groups are similar to the local group in terms of their morphology and the  and halo mass functions ( pisano et  al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) , we can use our non - detections to infer the distribution of hvcs within the local group . to this end , we have constructed a simple model for the distribution of chvcs around the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "because chvcs are the most likely class of hvcs to be dark matter dominated and reside at larger distances from the milky way , we only consider this class of objects ( braun & burton 2001 ) .    for our model , we start with the cataloged chvcs from putman et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and de heij et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) from the southern hipass and northern leiden - dwingeloo surveys .",
    "this yields 270 chvcs with measured fluxes and velocity widths .",
    "we assume these clouds are distributed with a three - dimensional gaussian distance distribution around the milky way characterized by a given d@xmath17 . after assigning a distance to a cloud ,",
    "we get an  mass which we compare to our 10@xmath11 detection limit for the cloud s velocity width to determine if we could detect this cloud in one of our groups . we carry out a monte carlo simulation with 10,000 trials noting the number of times we have zero detections .",
    "we do this for a variety of d@xmath17 values , ranging from 50 kpc to 500 kpc , and for differing parent numbers of chvcs , ranging from 27 to 1728 clouds ( 0.1 - 6.4 times the number of galactic chvcs ) .",
    "two examples of this model are presented in figure  [ fig : model ] for a total number of 270 chvcs with d@xmath17 = 500 kpc ( left ) and 250 kpc ( right ) .",
    "note that for the latter model , distinctly fewer chvcs would have been detected in our survey . while our model is distinctly less complex than those of previous authors ( e.g. blitz et  al .",
    "1999 , braun & burton 1999 , de heij et  al .",
    "2002b ) that include assumptions as to the physical properties of hvcs , it can be seen as a generalization of these models . for reference ,",
    "the blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) models have d@xmath18 500 kpc while the de heij et  al .  ( 2002b ) model has d@xmath19 150 kpc .",
    "there are a few important aspects of this model which may limit its potential utility .",
    "first of all , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : model ] , we do not expect to detect the vast majority of chvcs at the distance of our groups , but only the most massive .",
    "as d@xmath17 decreases , this becomes more of an issue .",
    "for example , at d@xmath17 = 500 kpc , the average chvc  mass is @xmath710@xmath9@xmath3 , while our detection limit is over 10@xmath9@xmath3 , but at d@xmath17 = 250 kpc , the average  mass is only @xmath710@xmath12@xmath3 . as such , the detailed nature of the flux and linewidth distributions of chvcs around the milky way is of critical importance .",
    "if this is different around other galaxies in other groups , in particular if the highest flux chvcs are absent in such groups , then this model may not yield accurate limits .",
    "it is also important to note that the number of chvcs observed around the milky way may not be equal to the total number present , neither of which need be equal to the number around galaxies in other groups .",
    "this is why we vary the total number of chvcs in our model .",
    "if the number is higher , then the constraints will be stronger .",
    "if other types of hvcs are considered or the existing catalogs of chvcs are incomplete , then , again , we would expect to detect more analogs so our distance constraints would be more stringent .",
    "we can , however , make a rough estimate of how many clouds we expect in each group .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations of the formation of the local group ( klypin et  al .",
    "1999 ) , show that the number of satellites per galaxy is proportional to the mass of that galaxy , which is proportional to the cube of that galaxy s circular velocity , @xmath20 .",
    "this can also be argued via the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) . using published inclinations , and measured velocity width for each group galaxy ,",
    "the number of expected chvcs in each group is within a factor of two of the number seen around the milky way .",
    "this is accounted for in our model comparisons , but will not have a major effect on our distance limits .",
    "finally , it is possible that hvcs are present in all of the groups we observed , but that they effectively cover the entire area of the group . in this case , in our reductions , we would have subtracted out the real signal as sky .",
    "this is unlikely as milky way hvcs only cover 37% of the sky down to a column density of 7@xmath110@xmath21@xmath22 ( murphy , lockman , & savage 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , such a distribution would be inconsistent with the statistics of mgii and lyman limit absorption line systems seen towards quasars ( charlton , churchill , & rigby 2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : results ] shows the probability of zero detections as a function of the parent number of chvcs , d@xmath17 , and the average @xmath8  of chvcs for each group and the combined probability for the three groups .",
    "we can combine the individual group probabilities since they are independent experiments .",
    "the figure shows that our non - detection of hvc analogs means that the average  mass of chvcs must be less than 10@xmath12@xmath3at the 95.45% confidence level .",
    "this assumes that the properties of chvcs in these groups are the same as those in cataloged in the local group .",
    "if this is the case , then we can infer that for this mass , chvcs in the local group must be clustered within d@xmath23 160 kpc of the milky way .",
    "if we were to consider all hvcs in our model , then these limits would be even stronger .",
    "this conclusion is robust even when considering different models for the chvc distribution .",
    "the average  mass of chvcs is the same if they are distributed in a filamentary manner or if we adopt the de heij et  al.(2002b ) model .",
    "these limits are inconsistent with original models of blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) which would have median distances of @xmath71 mpc with an @xmath8  of @xmath710@xmath9@xmath3 .",
    "our sensitivity is not sufficient to constrain the best fit de heij et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) model .",
    "our results , when compared with those of other authors , reveal a remarkably consistent picture for the distribution of hvcs in close proximity to individual galaxies",
    ". zwaan s ( 2001 ) study of parts of five groups with arecibo constrained hvcs to be within 200 kpc of group barycenters .",
    "braun & thilker ( 2004 ) and thilker et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) report on a possible population of hvcs around m31 with @xmath8  ranging from 10@xmath24@xmath3  and a gaussian distance dispersion of 55 kpc .",
    "attempts to measure or model the distances to hvcs observed around the milky way also point to this same picture .",
    "the few direct stellar absorption line distances available for hvc complexes place these clouds within @xmath710 kpc of the milky way ( wakker et  al .",
    "putman et  al.s ( 2003 ) h@xmath25 observations of hvcs and chvcs around the milky way constrain those clouds to be within @xmath740 kpc of the galaxy assuming a model for the escaping ionizing radiation .",
    "maloney & putman ( 2002 ) and sternberg , mckee , & wolfire ( 2002 ) modeled chvcs as gaseous objects within dark matter halos while accounting for the effects of ionization , thermal balance and confinement by an external medium and determined that chvcs must lie within 150 kpc of the milky way . finally , de heij et  al.s ( 2002b ) model of the local group distribution of chvcs using their assumed physical properties predicts a distribution with d@xmath26150 - 200 kpc .    at these distances chvcs",
    "are more closely associated with the milky way than the local group , which suggests that these clouds are associated more with individual galaxy formation instead of group formation as originally suggested by blitz et  al .",
    "also at these distances , the total  mass in chvcs is @xmath010@xmath4@xmath3 , and even with substantial dark matter would only contribute a small fraction of the total mass of the local group .",
    "they would still contribute fuel for star formation in the milky way , but only as much  as a single dwarf galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , chvcs may still be the repository for large amounts of ionized gas ( maloney & putman 2002 , sternberg et al .",
    "2002 ) which could condense onto the milky way .",
    "interestingly , the similarity of the inferred radial distribution of chvcs with milky way satellites and models of galaxy formation ( kravstov et  al .  2004 ) may actually strengthen the argument that chvcs are associated with low mass dark matter halos .",
    "future searches for chvc analogs associated with galaxy formation with properties like those inferred by de heij et  al .   ( 2002b ) will be difficult due to their low masses .",
    "it will also be difficulty to infer the origin of any such analogs . within 160 kpc of a galaxy ,  associated with galactic fountains and tidal interactions",
    "will be prevalent making the identification of chvcs associated with galaxy formation difficult . nevertheless , if we can find gas clouds associated with galaxy formation it will not only shed light on the nature of high velocity clouds , but serve as a valuable check on models of galaxy formation .",
    "the authors wish to thank the staff at parkes and the atca for their assistance with observing .",
    "we thank warwick wilson and the atnf engineering group for their excellent work in making the 16 mhz filters for these observations .",
    "we thank chris brook for help with additional observing and tim connors for help during the cube searching process .",
