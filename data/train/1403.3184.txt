    "in crystal - field theory , anisotropic coulomb potential causes deviation of wavefunctions from spherical symmetry around a site of an ionic crystal.@xcite it is well known that @xmath1 electrons in the octahedral field produced by six surrounding anions split into @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals with different energies .",
    "the anisotropic potential is described as a multipole expansion , a scalar function of the position .",
    "the potential is originally composed of contributions from the nearest neighboring ions with high symmetry , or cubic groups .",
    "more general consideration of the anisotropic potential , which includes contributions beyond the neighboring ions with lower symmetry , is discussed using the ewald method.@xcite however , ref .",

    "this interaction is controlled by spin orientations at the nearest neighboring sites , similar to the crystal field theory , but describes local rotational symmetry exactly at the site , in contrast to the anisotropy above .",

    ", coulomb interaction in crystals with infinite periodicity were reinvestigated in the point - charge model , based on the ewald method .",
    "it turns out that , in the presence of the long - range interaction , the coulomb potential has another , non - scalar , contribution , which breaks the spherical symmetry at the site , in addition to the scalar contribution .",
    "this dual aspects of the potential may cause the conditional convergence of the ewald method .",
    "the non - scalar contribution , which has the same deviation of the spherical symmetry as the heisenberg interaction , is caused by the ion configuration of the infinite lattice , and coexists with distortion of the charge from the original spherical symmetry .",
    "this non - scalar contributions neither violate poisson s equation nor affect scalar potential and charge .",
    "furthermore , it can be defined both at magnetic and non - magnetic ions , in contrast to the heisenberg interaction , and be considered as anisotropy of local relative permittivity in the framework of the scalar - potential field .    as specific examples , anisotropic potentials and charges of a @xmath1-ion in a nacl - type structure and ions in zno , zns ( zinc blende ) , caf@xmath4 , tio@xmath4 ( rutile ) , srtio@xmath5 , la@xmath4cuo@xmath6 , nd@xmath4cuo@xmath6 , and",

    "though these two ( scalar and non - scalar ) potentials are defined differently , they have the same symmetries and similar magnitudes at the ion sites in srtio@xmath5 and the @xmath1-ion site in the nacl - type structure .",
    "the similar features are also observed in more complicated materials , such as zno , zns , caf@xmath4 , tio@xmath4 , and nd@xmath4cuo@xmath6 .",
    "however , these potentials have completely different symmetries at the o sites in the cuo@xmath4 planes of la@xmath4cuo@xmath6 and hgba@xmath4cuo@xmath6 , parent materials of hole - doping high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "this difference may have some connection with the hole - doped superconductivity .",
    "in the ewald method , the coulomb potential induced by the surrounding point charges at an @xmath7-th ion site ( @xmath8 ) is expressed as follows , using a parameter @xmath9 ; @xmath10 when the crystal has charge neutrality . here , @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath12 is the contribution from real space : @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the contribution from reciprocal space : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume of the unit cell .    when @xmath9 is small enough ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath14 approaches zero , and eq .",

    "it should be noted that the charges in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ( @xmath37 ) should also deviate from scalars , because eq .  ( 5 ) indicates deviation from the spherical ( isotropic ) charge at @xmath8 .",
    "however , this further deviation is not considered here for simplicity .",
    "for instance , the legendre expansions at ti and o sites in a cubic perovskite , srtio@xmath5 ( @xmath38=3.905  ) , are considered ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the crystal , scalar point charges ( sr@xmath39 , ti@xmath40 , and o@xmath41 ) are assumed , which behave as ions .",
    "1(a ) and ( c ) show @xmath42 and @xmath43 , or @xmath9 dependence of the scalar ( isotropic ) terms ( @xmath44 ) at the ti and o sites .",
    "( 5 ) indicates that the isotropic potentials are given by the @xmath45-intercepts ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , and that the isotropic charges are given by the slopes ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the former exactly corresponds to the conventional scalar potentials ( @xmath46=23.8 ev and @xmath47=@xmath5045.6 ev ) and the latter gives the self charges at @xmath8 ( @xmath48=@xmath502 and @xmath49=+4 ) .",
    "these values are unchanged in an arbitrary region of @xmath9 .    at the ti site , though the anisotropic contributions of @xmath51=1 , 2 , and 3 are zero , non - zero contribution appears at the 4th order ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "when the ti - o bonds are directed to the cartesian coordinates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 become non - zero , as seen in fig .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic contribution ( @xmath44 , fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , these coefficients have @xmath9 dependence . for small @xmath9",
    ", we can estimate the non - scalar potential and charge using the intercepts and slopes of the dotted lines in fig .",
    "one of the inset figures ( blue ) in fig .",
    "1(b ) suggests positive charge anisotropy determined by the slopes of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the other ( red ) suggests negative potential anisotropy obtained by the intercepts .",
    "both the anisotropic potential and charge have @xmath55 symmetry , but the signs are opposite .",
    "these features are similar to the isotropic contributions , where the isotropic ( scalar ) charge and potential ( @xmath49 and @xmath47 ) have the same ( spherical ) symmetry with the opposite signs , as seen in fig .",
    "this similarity validates the existence of the non - scalar ( anisotropic ) charge and potential at small @xmath9 .    at the o site",
    ", non - zero contribution appears at the 2nd order ( @xmath56 ) ; when the @xmath57-axis is taken along the ti - o bond direction , @xmath58 becomes non - zero as shown in fig .",
    "similar to the ti site , the anisotropic potential and charge at o can be defined ( only ) for small @xmath9 ; the slope and intercept of @xmath58 give negative charge anisotropy ( red ) and positive potential anisotropy ( blue ) , as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "again , the potential and charge have the same symmetry with the opposite signs .",
    "these non - scalar contributions of the potential and charge have several features .",
    "first , these do not violate the poisson s equation around the @xmath7-th ion ; only the scalar term of the charge ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath8 contributes to the equation , because eq .  ( 5 ) satisfies the following equation , @xmath60 for even @xmath23 .",
    "secondly , the non - scalar potential and charge reflect rotational symmetry at the @xmath7-th site , because the legendre expansion in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is chiefly affected by the surrounding ions ( @xmath12 ) for small @xmath9 .",
    "finally , the non - scalar potential and charge for small @xmath9 suggest some relation to the long - range coulomb interaction , because @xmath9 has the dimension of @xmath61 .",
    "these features suggest spherical symmetry breaking of the potential and charge at @xmath8 , owing to the long - range coulomb interaction .    in the conventional crystal - field theory , on the other hand",
    ", anisotropic coulomb potential caused by the neighboring ions around @xmath8 is expressed as a scalar function of the position . when contribution of the infinite periodicity ( beyond the neighboring ions ) is included in the theory ,",

    "this @xmath73 is essentially distinct from the non - scalar contribution @xmath74 ; @xmath73 specifies the potential only , while @xmath74 determines both the potential and charge .    in short",
    ", the anisotropic coulomb potential can be defined in two ways in the framework of the point - charge ( ionic ) model .",
    "one is the multipole expansion of the scalar potential around @xmath8 , which is given by eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 12 ) ( hereafter it is called @xmath75 for classification ) .",
    "this scalar potential is conventional and corresponds to the crystal - field theory for the infinite lattice .",
    "the other is obtained from the non - scalar contribution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) at the @xmath7-th site ( in the limit of @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) .",
    "the potential is accompanied by the non - scalar charge ( @xmath78 ) . both scalar and",
    "non - scalar potentials have absolute convergence in the ewald method .",
    "the latter non - scalar potential corresponds to the rotational symmetry at the site .",
    "given the fact that the non - scalar contribution ( @xmath74 , @xmath79 ) does not affect the scalar potential and charge , the scalar and non - scalar potential should work independently .",
    "furthermore , this has similar contribution to the heisenberg interaction ( note , the non - scalar potential works even at the non - magnetic ions ) , because both of them define anisotropy at the site .",
    "the non - scalar potential has orientation dependence at the site , which is understood as a anisotropic relative permittivity in the framework of the conventional scalar potential , while it is different from the dipole interaction caused by the scalar potential .",
    "in order to discuss the anisotropy , anisotropic potential at the @xmath7-th site , @xmath80 , for @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is the maximum ( minimum ) value of @xmath85 . in the same way , @xmath86 and",

    "the intrinsic difference between the scalar and non - scalar potentials may be correlated to difference between the magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom . at the same time , due to the simple picture , further contributions beyond the point - charge model for example , charge density , charge transfer , quantum spin , and so on are ignored in this manuscript .",
    "for example , the charge density obtained by the scalar potential will affect the non - scalar potential , as well as the rotational symmetry at the site . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the non - scalar potential is supposed to modify the original wavefunctions .",
    "further investigation is required to estimate detailed correlation between these contributions .",
    "to summarize , in the presence of the long - range coulomb interaction , the potential has two different contributions , which are given by legendre expansions .",
    "one is the conventional scalar contribution , which is expressed as a multipole expansion .",
    "the other is the non - scalar contribution , which is accompanied by the non - scalar charge .",
    "the non - scalar potential does not affect the scalar contribution , but is correlated to the classical heisenberg interaction .",
    "the scalar and non - scalar potentials have absolute convergence in the ewald method , and have similar shapes and sizes for most of the ions despite the different definitions .",
    "consequently , in these materials , the non - scalar potentials are expected to give additional effects to the anisotropic states caused by the scalar potentials . on the other hand ,",
    "the potentials have different symmetries in the parent materials of hole - doping high-@xmath0 cuprates , la@xmath4cuo@xmath6 and hgba@xmath4cuo@xmath6 .",
    "this difference may cause the superconductivity .",
    "estimation of the non - scalar potential is expected to be important to understand physical properties of ionic and slightly - doped materials .",
