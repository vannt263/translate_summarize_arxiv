    "the mimetic gravity idea was introduced some time ago by mukhanov and chamseddine @xcite , and ever since it has been thoroughly studied in the literature @xcite . in the context of mimetic gravity ,",
    "the conformal degree of freedom of the background metric becomes a matter component of the full theory , so this could play the role of cold dark matter . later on in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mimetic gravity theory was studied in the context of @xmath0 gravity , and the formalism of lagrange multipliers @xcite was used .",
    "the presence of the lagrange multiplier and of the potential offered the possibility for realizing various cosmologies , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , for some recent studies .    in this paper we shall use the mimetic @xmath0 gravity framework in order to investigate the behavior of dark energy oscillations in the presence of the potential and lagrange multiplier . in the standard @xmath0 gravity approach , there is a big issue coming from dark energy oscillations @xcite near the end of the matter domination era and during the late - time acceleration era @xcite .",
    "this oscillations issue persists in some models even at present time , so this is a rather disturbing issue . in the standard approach , in order to make the dark energy oscillations milder , it was compelling to modify the @xmath0 gravity by adding by hand certain power - law modifications .",
    "as we will show , in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity , it is not necessary to add any power - law modifications and also by appropriately choosing the mimetic potential and lagrange multiplier , this can almost make the oscillations to disappear or to have very small amplitude near and during the late - time era .    in this paper we shall be interested in mimetic @xmath0 gravity models ,",
    "in which we will specify the mimetic potential , the lagrange multiplier and the @xmath0 gravity . with regards to the @xmath0 gravity , we shall choose an exponential model which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this exponential model passes all the local tests @xcite and some of its variants unify early and late - time acceleration .",
    "also it mimics the @xmath1cdm model , so it has appealing properties .",
    "in addition , the motivation for using exponential @xmath0 gravity models comes from the fact that recent studies indicate that exponential models resemble to a great extent the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "particularly the data coming from baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies and also studies of the shift parameters corresponding to the cosmic microwave background radiation indicate that there is no possible way to distinguish the resulting cosmological evolutions caused by exponential @xmath0 models and the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "this justifies to a great extent why we decided to use an exponential @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "our aim is to use special variables which measure the deviation of the mimetic @xmath0 gravity model from the @xmath1cdm model , and we shall study the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath2 and of the total equation of state parameter @xmath3 as functions of the redshift @xmath4 . for this calculation we shall use specific forms of the mimetic potential and lagrange multiplier and also we shall use the exponential @xmath0 gravity without the power - law modifications . the result is compared to the exponential with power - law term ordinary @xmath0 gravity case , and as we demonstrate the oscillations in the mimetic case are damped and these have smaller amplitude in comparison to the ordinary @xmath0 gravity case .",
    "finally , we compute the growth factor of matter perturbations for both the mimetic and non - mimetic @xmath0 gravity .",
    "for the calculation we shall assume that the universe is filled with radiation only in the mimetic case and with non - relativistic matter and radiation in the ordinary @xmath0 case .",
    "the resulting picture shows that the evolution of the growth factor as a function of the redshift is different for the various mimetic models when compared to the ordinary @xmath0 model and also the mimetic models have differences between them .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss various alternative cosmological scenarios with one of these being related to the cosmographic approach .",
    "we need to note that the results of our analysis strongly indicate that the phantom line is crossed even in the context of mimetic @xmath0 theory . in the literature",
    ", a lot of effort has been made towards the complete understanding of the @xmath5 line crossing , in the context of dark energy physics , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review on this issue .",
    "this issue captivates the interest of cosmologists , due to an existing proof of the no - go theorem on this issue , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , which states that in the standard einstein - hilbert gravity , the cosmological perturbations may become ill behaved if the dark energy crosses the phantom line @xmath5 . now",
    "this issue may be overcome in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity , and in principle a suitable choice of the potential may indeed succeed that , however in this paper we will not address this physically `` deep '' issue , since a concise treatment of the cosmological perturbations in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity is needed , which could be treated as a special form of an @xmath6 gravity .",
    "however this issue is significantly interesting and we will address it in a future work , especially the impact of the phantom divide crossing on the cosmological perturbations of mimetic @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in addition to the perturbations issue , in principle , quantum field theory becomes inconsistent with phantom cosmology due to a catastrophic instability that occurs in the theory .",
    "also phantom cosmology maybe expected to occur in the future , but it is hard to believe it happened in the past ( nevertheless , there are proposals on phantom inflation ) .",
    "in addition , oscillatory behavior in the total effective equation of state may also quickly bring instabilities , so this is something that needs to be avoided .",
    "as we shall demonstrate mimetic gravity succeeds in making the oscillations almost to vanish , but the phantom divide crossing occurs , so a deeper analysis is needed to a fundamental level to see if mimetic gravity makes the phantom dived crossing to disappear from the theory .",
    "this would be interesting , since only a complete theory of quantum gravity makes this possible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present in brief the mimetic @xmath0 gravity formalism and also the essentials of the exponential @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "then we present the general formalism for studying the dark energy oscillations and we perform a numerical analysis for various mimetic @xmath0 models .",
    "also we study in brief the evolution of the growth factor as a function of the redshift and we discuss some alternative scenarios related to the cosmographic principle . finally , the conclusions follow in the end of the paper .",
    "here we shall present the mimetic @xmath0 gravity framework with lagrange multiplier and potential . for more details on these issues",
    "see @xcite . in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the hidden internal conformal degrees of freedom of the metric are being used @xcite , and therefore the physical metric @xmath7 can be written in terms of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath8 and in terms of an auxiliary metric @xmath9 , in the following way @xmath10 the most important assumption in the context of mimetic theories is that the gravitational action should be varied with respect to the auxiliary metric . from eq .",
    "( [ metrpar ] ) it easily follows that , @xmath11 also as it can easily be checked , the parametrization ( [ metrpar ] ) is invariant under the weyl transformation @xmath12 , and effectively the auxiliary metric @xmath13 does not appear in the final action .",
    "we assume that the physical metric is a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric with line element , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being as usual the scale factor .",
    "the gravitational action of the mimetic @xmath0 gravity with mimetic potential @xmath16 and lagrange multiplier @xmath17 is @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lagrangian of the matter fields present , which we shall assume that are perfect fluids .",
    "also we assume that the auxiliary scalar field depends only on the cosmic time . by varying the action ( [ actionmimeticfraction ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath7",
    ", we obtain the following equations , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy momentum tensor corresponding to the matter fluids present . moreover , by varying the action with respect to the auxiliary scalar field @xmath8 , we obtain , @xmath22 where the `` prime '' denotes differentiation with respect to the auxiliary scalar @xmath8 . upon variation of the action ( [ actionmimeticfraction ] ) with respect to the lagrange multiplier @xmath23 , we obtain , @xmath24 and as it can be seen , the above equation is identical to eq .",
    "( [ impl1 ] ) .",
    "hence the mimetic constraint ( [ impl1 ] ) is satisfied also for the mimetic theory with lagrange multiplier and mimetic potential .",
    "note that the lagrange multiplier actually introduces the mimetic constraint , so this is why in the present case we varied the action ( [ actionmimeticfraction ] ) with respect to the physical metric and not with respect to the auxiliary metric .",
    "for the metric ( [ frw ] ) , and under the assumption that the scalar field depends on the cosmic time , the equations of motion ( [ aeden ] ) , ( [ scalvar ] ) and ( [ lambdavar ] ) , can be written in the following way , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where the `` dot '' denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath29 , and the prime in eqs .",
    "( [ enm1 ] ) and ( [ enm2 ] ) denotes differentiation with respect to the ricci scalar @xmath30 , while in eq .",
    "( [ enm3 ] ) it denotes differentiation with respect to the auxiliary scalar gravity plus the mimetic term @xmath31 , as it can be seen in ref .",
    "also @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the energy density and the effective pressure of the matter fluids present . from eq .",
    "( [ enm3 ] ) it follows that the auxiliary scalar is identified with the cosmic time @xmath29 , a feature also present in the einstein - hilbert mimetic gravity , as it can easily be seen by the mimetic constraint ( [ impl1 ] ) .",
    "hence , by using this identification , eq .",
    "( [ enm2 ] ) can be written in the following way , @xmath34 effectively , the mimetic potential @xmath35 is expressed in terms of the @xmath0 gravity , the hubble rate and the effective pressure as follows , @xmath36 correspondingly , the lagrange multiplier @xmath37 is equal to , @xmath38 given the hubble rate @xmath39 , it is possible to realize any arbitrary cosmic evolution .",
    "in addition , given the @xmath0 gravity and the hubble rate , by appropriately choosing the lagrange multiplier and the mimetic potential , it is possible to realize a viable cosmological evolution .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate how the dark energy oscillations behave in the presence of the mimetic potential and the lagrange multiplier .",
    "as we shall see , the mimetic potential and lagrange multiplier introduce many new appealing features in the theory under study .",
    "before we proceed to this , in the next section we shall briefly present the essential features of the @xmath0 we shall use .      in the literature there exist various viable @xmath0 gravity models , which have to satisfy a number of constraints in order these can be considered viable @xcite . for the purposes of this paper we shall use an exponential @xmath0 gravity model which has very appealing features , and it was introduced in ref .",
    "particularly , it successfully passes all the local astrophysical constraints , it provides a theoretical framework for the unified description of the late and early - time acceleration , and it mimics the @xmath1cdm model at large curvature values . for detailed studies of exponential models of @xmath0 gravity see @xcite .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite which we will study in this paper , has the following functional form , @xmath40 where @xmath1 is the present time cosmological constant and @xmath41 is a positive free parameter which is assumed to be @xmath42 .",
    "an issue that occurs in @xmath0 gravity theories is the existence of large dark energy oscillations during the matter domination era and later on .",
    "the higher derivatives of the hubble rate strongly diverge as a consequence of the dark energy oscillations during the matter domination era , as was discussed in detail in refs .",
    "particularly , the high frequency dark energy oscillations occur for large @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the cosmological redshift which is related to the scale factor as @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , the derivatives of the dark energy effective energy density , which we denote as @xmath44 , also take large values , and in effect this procedure affects the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the dark energy oscillations have higher frequency in the cases that the @xmath0 gravity mimics the @xmath1cdm model , which occurs when @xmath46 .",
    "this issue also occurs for the model ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) , so a consistent way to remedy the high curvature regime of the model ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , were power - law modifications were included in the @xmath0 gravity ( [ expmodnocurv ] ) .",
    "particularly , the exponential with power - law term @xmath0 gravity has the following form , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . in effect",
    "the dark energy oscillations are stabilized and the frequency of the oscillations becomes nearly constant @xcite . notice that with the addition of the power - law modifications , the viability of the model is retained , while the dark energy oscillations problem is amended too .",
    "for example the flat space solution is still the minkowski spacetime , and the power - law modifications vanish in the de - sitter epoch , when @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 , which is satisfied by the choice of @xmath50 we made earlier .    as we already mentioned in the introduction , in order to stabilize the dark energy oscillations in the non - mimetic @xmath0 gravity case , the power - law modifications are necessary , at least for the class of models under study .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in the next sections , the power - law modifications are not needed in the case of the mimetic @xmath0 gravity since by appropriately choosing the mimetic potential and the lagrange multiplier , the high frequency oscillations of the dark energy disappear or become damped , at least for the specific class of @xmath0 models under study .",
    "thus , the mimetic potential and the lagrange multiplier play the role of the power - law modifications and more importantly , these appear from the beginning in the theory without the need to introduce them by hand . in the next section we demonstrate in detail how this can be done in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity .      in this section",
    "we shall study the dark energy oscillations of a universe filled with radiation in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity , and we compare these oscillations to the exponential with power - law term @xmath0 gravity case oscillations .",
    "as we already mentioned , in the standard @xmath0 gravity approach , the dark energy oscillations have extremely large frequencies near the end of the matter domination era .",
    "this is not an appealing feature since these oscillations would affect even the present time era , so in order to amend this issue , in the standard @xmath0 gravity approach , power - law modifications are needed and in effect the oscillations are damped at the late stages of our universe evolution . as we demonstrate in this section , there is no need for power - law modifications in the mimetic @xmath0 case , since the mimetic potential and the lagrange multiplier actually amend the dark energy oscillations .",
    "as we will show , the choice of the potential and lagrange multiplier plays an important role .",
    "also in some cases the oscillations have almost zero amplitude and the values of the dark energy density and of the effective equation of state parameter at present time are very close to observational values .    for the purposes of our study",
    ", we shall express all the physical quantities as functions of the redshift @xmath52 and also we shall introduce new variables which are more appropriate for the study of the dark energy oscillations .",
    "the resulting differential equations will determine the behavior and evolution of the dark energy oscillations , and by numerically solving these we will study the evolution of the dark energy density @xmath2 and of the effective equation of state parameter @xmath3 , as functions of the redshift @xmath4 . for the numerical analysis the focus will be for redshifts @xmath53 , since we are interested for the last stage of the matter domination era , which started at @xmath54 and finished around @xmath55 . after this era ,",
    "the late - time acceleration era started which continues until today at @xmath56 .",
    "there is a specific motivation for us to express all the physical quantities as functions of the redshift , and we specify for values @xmath57 , since the near future observational data will come from gamma ray bursts or type ia supernovae or other standard candles , corresponding to redshifts with @xmath58 .",
    "let us proceed to construct the master equation which governs the dark energy oscillations evolution .",
    "we rewrite the frw equation ( [ enm1 ] ) as follows , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total mass energy density of the perfect fluids present . for the mimetic @xmath0 gravity case",
    ", we shall assume that only radiation is present , although even for the vacuum case , the resulting picture is qualitatively the same .",
    "so for the mimetic case , the total energy density is , @xmath61 while for the non - mimetic standard @xmath0 gravity case , the energy density will be assumed to be as follows , @xmath62    rewriting the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flrw ] ) we obtain , @xmath63 with @xmath30 being the ricci scalar which can be written as follows , @xmath64 for notational simplicity we introduce the following function , @xmath65 so if this is specified , this will determine how the oscillations will evolve , as we now demonstrate .",
    "notice that if the function @xmath66 is specified , then by using eq .",
    "( [ enm3 ] ) , one easily finds the lagrange multiplier , given the hubble rate and via @xmath66 , the potential can be determined .",
    "the dark energy oscillations can be consistently described by using the following variables ,    @xmath67    with @xmath44 being the total energy density of dark energy , and also @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the present values of the mass - energy densities corresponding to non interacting matter and radiation respectively .",
    "in addition , the variable @xmath70 is the ratio @xmath71 . the new variable that can describe the dark energy oscillations",

    "we study one such physical observable related to the matter density perturbations , namely the growth factor .    before proceeding to the growth factor issue",
    ", it is worth discussing whether the phantom divide is crossed in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity . for a detailed study on the phantom divide issue see @xcite .",

    "so it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the mimetic potential on this type of singular evolutions , or even to add some extra imperfect fluid in the theory in order to avoid the future singularity .",
    "these tasks however exceed the purpose of this paper so we will address these in detail in a future work .",
    "the cosmological perturbations are always a strong criterion that can help drastically to distinguish the various theoretical proposals for the universe evolution .",
    "this is owing to the fact that the cosmological perturbations differentiate the predicted evolutions of each model from the background evolution , and this provides information on how this differentiation is achieved @xcite .",
    "the focus in this paper is on matter density perturbations , and we shall use the sub - horizon approximation .",
    "practically , in the context of the sub - horizon approximation , the comoving wavelength @xmath151 along with the spacelike hypersurface that describes the evolution , are much shorter than the corresponding hubble horizon @xmath152 , or in a quantitative way this implies that @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 being the comoving wavenumber an the scale factor respectively . for the mimetic @xmath0 gravity case , the perfect fluid matter content is that of eq .",

    "notice that in the mimetic @xmath0 case with potential , the effective gravitational constant is also given by eq .",

    "all the mimetic models produce a growth factor which is quite well below the ordinary @xmath0 gravity case ( black thick curve ) .",
    "also the three different models generate a different evolution of the growth factor , as it can be seen in the left plot .",
    "hence , the growth factor can be a consistent criterion which differentiates the various models we studied in this paper .",
    "one case that we did not address in the previous sections is the case of mimetic @xmath0 gravity without potential and lagrange multiplier .",
    "this was studied in @xcite , and the resulting equations of motion for the frw metric ( [ frw ] ) are similar to eqs .",
    "( [ enm1 ] ) , and ( [ enm2 ] ) , with the difference that the potential and the lagrange multiplier are replaced by a term @xmath31 .",
    "it is exactly this term that mimics the dark matter , since it originates from the hidden conformal degree of freedom of the metric tensor .",
    "we performed an analysis for the cosmological evolution of the dark energy oscillations for this case , and the resulting picture is very similar to the ordinary @xmath0 case , since the difference is just the presence of the free parameter @xmath183 .",
    "so practically the only difference is that all the quantities are rescaled , for example the behavior of the dark energy parameter is presented in fig .",
    "[ thorn ] .",
    ", for the simple mimetic case @xmath31 ( blue curve ) .",
    "the resulting dark energy oscillations are rescaled , depending on the choice of the parameter @xmath183 . in this case",
    "we chose @xmath184 . ]    finally , let us note that the presence of the mimetic potential and the lagrange multiplier in the lagrangian offers many possibilities for realization of various cosmologies .",
    "it is known that cosmographic studies indicate that the cosmological standard model behaves as follows , @xcite , @xmath185 in the mimetic model at hand , the hubble rate in terms of the function @xmath66 is given in eq .",
    "( [ hubblepar ] ) , so by choosing the function @xmath66 as follows , @xmath186 then , the corresponding evolution is identical to ( [ capowner ] ) . therefore , the mimetic case offers much freedom for model building .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated that in the context of mimetic @xmath0 gravity with lagrange multiplier and mimetic potential , it is possible to solve in a kind of elegant way the problem of dark energy oscillations at late times .",
    "particularly , in the standard @xmath0 gravity approach , the dark energy equation of state oscillates strongly after @xmath55 , which is near the end of the matter domination era , and until @xmath56 , which is the present time . in the standard approach , the @xmath0 gravity has to be modified by adding power - law modifications , however the problem is not completely solved . in the mimetic case ,",
    "no power - law modifications are needed , and moreover by appropriately choosing the potential and the lagrange multiplier , it is possible to minimize the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "we performed a numerical analysis which showed in a clear way that the oscillations are strongly damped , so the mimetic potential and lagrange multiplier solve this serious issue .",
    "in addition , by calculating the present day values of the mimetic dark energy density parameter @xmath187 , and the total effective equation of state parameter @xmath98 , we demonstrated that the values are very close to the observational data and in some cases , full concordance with observations is achieved .",
    "finally , we calculated the growth factor for all the mimetic models and we compared its behavior as a function of the redshift @xmath4 with the ordinary @xmath0 gravity case .",
    "as we showed , the various mimetic models have strong differences with the ordinary @xmath0 and also there are differences between the growth factor of each model .",
    "the mimetic @xmath0 gravity framework proves to be very useful , since many cosmological evolutions can be realized in the context of this theory .",
    "the question is , can this theory be considered as a viable modified gravity candidate ?",
    "indeed it seems that with this theory , everything can be realized and someone could say that it lacks of predictability . from our point of view , mimetic gravity is more than a simple mathematical construction .",
    "it is appealing and in some sense `` economical '' since nothing new is added to the theory and the considerations involve the internal conformal degree of freedom of the metric .",
    "moreover , compatibility with the observational data can be achieved and in addition , with the present work we showed that the theoretical problem of dark energy oscillations is solved without adding by hand curvature correction terms .",
    "more importantly , the observational values of the dark energy density parameter and of the total effective equation of state parameter are in agreement or very close to the observational values of these parameters .",
    "but in all cases we have better agreement in comparison to the values corresponding to the ordinary @xmath0 case , so the mimetic theory is subtly more appealing .",
    "also the predicted growth factor of the mimetic models is quite lower in magnitude in comparison to the ordinary @xmath0 case .",
    "hence , by taking into account all the aforementioned features and also the ones appearing in the literature , one may find it difficult to claim that this theory is rather a mathematical construction , and the theory deserves more work in order to reveal all its fundamental features .",
    "an interesting quite novel research stream could start by considering mimetic modifications of torsion - based theories of gravity , such as teleparallel theories of the form @xmath188 , with @xmath189 being the torsion scalar , see for example the recent work @xcite .",
    "this study would be strongly motivated by the fact that in the particular case @xmath190 , one gets the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity , in which case the equations of motion of the torsion and of the einstein - hilbert gravity coincide . however , in mimetic modifications of torsion theories , one should carefully reveal the conformal degree of freedom of the metric , by using the vierbeins appropriately .",
    "if this is true , a new theory with geometric originating dark matter would be obtained , so we defer this issue to a future work .",
