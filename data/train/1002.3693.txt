    "how the electronic structure and thermodynamic properties evolve through the mott transition has been a central issue in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "recently , insulating states close to the mott transition have attracted considerable attention due to their exotic properties .",
    "typical examples are found in a 2d organic conductor @xcite and @xmath13he adsorbed on graphite @xcite : both are considered to be in the vicinity of the mott transition having a tiny charge gap , and exhibit gapless spin - liquid behavior at low temperatures . if electron interaction is sufficiently strong and there is a large charge gap , a localized spin model gives a good description of the systems .",
    "whereas , in the vicinity of the mott transition , the expansion from the strong coupling limit suffers from slow convergence due to the small charge gap . in order to describe such systems , it is crucial to take account of charge fluctuations as well as spin ones .    among such insulators near the mott transition showing exotic behaviors , we focus on na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 in this paper .",
    "the lattice structure of na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 is similar to that of spinel oxides , while @xmath14 of ir@xmath15 pyrochlore sites are regularly replaced by non - magnetic na@xmath16 cations @xcite .",
    "the ir@xmath15 sublattice consists of a highly - frustrated three - dimensional ( 3d ) network of corner - sharing triangles , which is called the ` hyperkagome ' lattice [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u0](a ) ] .",
    "while the hyperkagome lattice shares a common local connectivity to the 2d kagome lattice , it has several distinct features such as the three dimensionality and structural chirality .",
    "it was reported that the charge gap of na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 is fairly small , suggesting that the compound is near the mott transition : the magnitude of the gap is estimated at @xmath17 k @xcite .",
    "puzzling behaviors have been reported for the thermodynamic properties of na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature is large @xmath18 k , which is comparable to the magnitude of the charge gap . in spite of the large curie - weiss temperature",
    ", there is no clear sign of phase transition down to @xmath19 k. @xmath3 shows a peak at @xmath20 k , and rapidly decreases as @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic susceptibility takes a finite value as @xmath5 , implying a macroscopic number of gapless magnetic excitations . as to the spin dynamics ,",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath2 , shows anomalous temperature dependence : @xmath6 shows a small peak at @xmath21 k , and decreases down to @xmath22 k. below @xmath22 k , @xmath6 shows a moderate temperature dependence , seemingly obeying the korringa law @xcite .    in spite of several theoretical efforts to make sense of the wide breadth of experimental results ,",
    "comprehensive understanding has not been reached yet .",
    "instabilities toward spin nematic phase and @xmath23 spin liquid were discussed for the classical and quantum heisenberg model on the hyperkagome lattice @xcite .",
    "effects of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and anisotropic exchange interaction have also been studied @xcite .",
    "a part of the difficulties faced by the theoretical studies stems from the fact that this compound locates in the vicinity of the mott transition .",
    "the exchange interaction estimated from the curie - weiss temperature is comparable to the magnitude of the charge gap , which suggests an importance of including charge fluctuations in addition to spin ones .",
    "so far , however , all the theoretical analyses have been done for localized spin models . in this paper , in order to gain a new insight into this puzzling situation , we consider the problem from the opposite side , i.e. , from the metallic region .",
    "we will explore how the electronic structure evolves as the electron correlation increases in the 3d frustrated hyperkagome systems .",
    "we study the hubbard model on the 3d frustrated hyperkagome lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u0](a ) , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 in the standard notations .",
    "we consider only the nearest - neighbor hopping and set @xmath25 as an energy unit hereafter .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath26 is controlled so that the system is at the half filling ( one electron per site on average ) . in na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 , each ir@xmath15 cation has one electron in three - fold @xmath27 orbitals on average .",
    "our model may describe the case that the trigonal distortion splits the @xmath27 levels and the lower nondegenerate @xmath28 level plays a major role .    to investigate the thermodynamics of this model",
    ", we adopt a cluster extension of the dynamical mean field theory @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the original lattice problem is mapped to a cluster impurity problem . in the present case , in order to take account of the unique spatial geometry of the hyperkagome structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u0](a ) , we consider a 12-sites cluster ( the unit cell of the hyperkagome lattice ) , and apply the iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) as an impurity solver .",
    "ipt is known to give a reliable description including the mott transition for a single - impurity problem @xcite , while it becomes poor for large @xmath29 in the case of clusters . in the present study ,",
    "we limit our investigations in the small to intermediate @xmath29 regime where the method is more reliable .",
    "first let us consider the basic electronic structure of the hyperkagome model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u0](b ) , we show the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath30 in comparison with that of the 2d kagome case .",
    "the diverging peak at the upper band edge ( @xmath31 ) comes from four - fold  degenerate flat bands .",
    "in addition , two sharp peaks exist in the middle of the band , which are the van - hove singularities at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "these features are similar to the 2d kagome case , however , there is an important difference : dos of the hyperkagome model has a large dip near the fermi energy ( @xmath34 ) , showing a pseudo - gap like feature . as a consequence , dos at the fermi energy",
    "is largely suppressed down to @xmath35% of that in the 2d kagome case .",
    "this small dos might be relevant to consider the fact that na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 is an insulator even though the electron correlation is expected to be weak for @xmath36 electrons of ir@xmath15 cations .",
    "when we switch on the electron correlation @xmath29 , these features of dos near the fermi energy undergo a strong renormalization by @xmath29 .",
    "we show the results at low @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_t0.1 ] .",
    "energies of the flat band and the van - hove singularity , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are renormalized and approach the fermi energy .",
    "these energy scales and their renormalization give rise to peculiar temperature dependences as we will see below .",
    "@xmath29 dependence of the density of states near the fermi energy at @xmath39 . ]",
    "@xmath29 dependence of the density of states near the fermi energy at @xmath39 . ]",
    "next , we show the results for the specific heat ( @xmath1 ) in fig .",
    "[ covert ] . at @xmath30",
    ", @xmath3 has a peak at @xmath40 , and rapidly decreases for @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 correlates with the energy scale of the van - hove singularity closer to the fermi level , @xmath43 : when @xmath0 crosses @xmath44 , @xmath1 shows a peak .",
    "the rapid decrease at lower @xmath0 is ascribed to the small dos at the fermi level . for comparison",
    ", we show @xmath3 for the 2d kagome model at @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ covert ] , which does not show such rapid decrease . as @xmath29 increases ,",
    "@xmath8 shifts to lower @xmath0 and the peak becomes sharper . as a result",
    ", the entropy is released more rapidly at low @xmath0 for larger @xmath29 .",
    "these interesting behaviors are closely related to the renormalization of dos by @xmath29 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_t0.1 ] .",
    "we note that the behaviors of @xmath3 are similar to those observed in the experiment in na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath6 . ]    temperature dependence of @xmath6 . ]",
    "finally , we discuss the spin relaxation time @xmath2 .",
    "we calculate @xmath6 from the standard formula , @xmath45 . in order to obtain the transverse spin susceptibility , @xmath46",
    ", we approximate the irreducible vertex function in the bethe - salpeter equation by the rpa contribution . figure  [ t1 t ] shows the results .",
    "@xmath6 shows a broad peak and decreases as @xmath0 is lowered . at low @xmath0 below @xmath47",
    ", it approaches a constant value , obeying the korringa law . although the peak shifts to lower @xmath0 and the peak becomes sharper for larger @xmath29 as seen in @xmath3 , the peak temperature , @xmath7 , is different from @xmath8 and higher than @xmath8 .",
    "this might be attributed to the fact that @xmath6 is more sensitive to the flat band at a higher energy whose singularity is much stronger than the van - hove singularity .",
    "note that @xmath6 is proportional to the square of dos at @xmath30 , in contrast to @xmath3 which is proportional to dos itself .",
    "our results show similar features to @xmath6 of na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 such as a peak at high @xmath0 followed by a large drop and a korringa - like behavior at the lowest @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained characteristic temperature dependences of @xmath3 and @xmath6 : both show a peak followed by a rapid decrease at low @xmath0 , and the peaks shift to lower @xmath0 as increasing @xmath29 .",
    "these behaviors are explained by the strong renormalization effect by @xmath29 on the peculiar structure of dos in the hyperkagome model .",
    "particularly important factors are the pseudo - gap like feature and two singularities , the van - hove singularity and the flat band .",
    "it is rather surprising that these results in the metallic regime are qualitatively similar to those observed in the hyperkagome material , na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 , which is an insulator with a small charge gap .",
    "the agreement implies a possibility that the renormalized singularities of dos survive and affect the thermodynamic properties even in the insulating regime when the system is in the vicinity of the mott transition . note that although the mott transition itself is known to be of first order , it is like a liquid - gas transition where the finite - temperature properties can be smoothly connected by bypassing the critical endpoint @xcite .    to explore this fascinating scenario ,",
    "it is necessary to extend our analysis to the insulating region beyond the mott transition .",
    "such study by employing an improved impurity solver is in progress .",
    "there , it is interesting to examine whether the vanishing or very tiny @xmath3 , the korringa - like behavior of @xmath6 , and a finite value of the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath48 are comprehensively explained . considering the real compound ,",
    "it is also interesting to consider effects of orbital degrees of freedom , spin - orbit interaction , and disorder due to na deficiency .",
