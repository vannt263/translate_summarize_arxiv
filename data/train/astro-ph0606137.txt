    "the two degree field facility ( 2df@xmath0}}$ ] ) of the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , had its original spectrographs mounted on the telescope top end ring .",
    "this was mandated by the capabilities of fibres at that time , and the spectrographs were designed for the primary science goal - a large redshift survey of moderate brightness galaxies .",
    "however , they were of limited utility in obtaining spectra of fainter objects , or at higher signal - to - noise or resolution .",
    "the reasons for this were :    * restricted size and weight , with implications for instrument stability and format * flexure and temperature variations , compromising both spectral and spatial stability of the system * imperfect optics giving variable point spread function ( psf ) , leading to systematic error in skyline subtraction that could not be reduced by increased integration . * significant scattered light and halation problems , limiting the dynamic range within and between spectra .    despite these limitations ,",
    "both spectrographs performed admirably resulting in a multitude of high quality scientific results over their 10 year careers . in august 2005 spectrographs 1 and 2 were retired from service to make way for installation of the next generation aat multi - purpose optical spectrograph , .",
    "the mechanical@xmath1}}$ ] and optical@xmath2}}$ ] design of  has been presented previously elsewhere . in what follows",
    "we briefly describe the _ as commissioned _ capabilities of .",
    "the commissioning program is outlined in table [ tab : time line ] .    .",
    "was commissioned november 2005 - january 2006 following the project time line outlined below . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "@xmath3the useful wavelength range for the gratings , in particular for the high - res gratings , is larger than the detector width ( 2k in the dispersion axis ) .",
    "hence the spectrograph set - up must be tuned to the required wavelength and blaze .",
    "@xmath4ifu resolution is somewhat higher , due to the smaller projected fibre diameter @xmath5 the 1700d caiii grating is a tuned to give maximum performance at 860 nm but is unsuitable for observations at other angles .",
    "on integration of the spectrograph and the 2df positioner , hartmann shutter focus tests readily demonstrated a minor spectrograph pupil misalignment .",
    "investigations have traced the problem to an unforeseen foible of the manufacturing process for the sub slits that comprise the individual elements of the full  slit .",
    "the support mechanism used to hold the fibres in place within each slit - let , as they are glued into place , has resulted in a depression of the fibres at the end of each slit - let and hence has introduced an error in the launch angle of light from the polished fibres ends .    the medium term solution is a re - shimming of each slit - let installed in the slit to correct the launch angle .",
    "longer term solutions include adjusting the slit unit field lens to steer the beam , or _",
    "simply _ re - terminating the 90 slit - lets that comprise the full  system . slanting the slit vain is undesirable due to the increased vignetting",
    "this would introduce .",
    "an unfortunate side effect of the polishing process required to prepare the slit units is that each slit - let is left with a highly reflective polished metal surface in the beam and only @xmath610s of microns below the science fibre exit faces .",
    "these surfaces can give rise to back reflections and scattered light .",
    "the effect is most noticeable in arc frames , due to their high contrast data , and is a low level effect .",
    "however , to retain the high fidelity of data the front of each slit unit will be blackened to suppress reflections .",
    "an unfortunate side effect of the ready availability of small , cheap , low power light sources , in a bewildering array of colours , means it now proves virtually impossible to source electronic equipment without status indicator lights . ensuring that such illumination is bypassed , deactivated or otherwise extinguished",
    "has required considerable effort .",
    "limit and proximity switches are noted as the worst offenders .",
    "we also require that all optical encoders are deactivated , all encoded motorised actuators de - energised and all pneumatic valve state indicators are suitably light sealed during observations .    that this is essential becomes obvious when one realises that these systems are no longer just inside the dome but actually inside one s spectrograph !  has been designed from the start with this in mind , but a consequence of the excellent scattered light suppression , and high sensitivity , is that every last light leak must ultimately be tracked down and eliminated .      at intervals during its working life a varying level of _ fringing fibres _",
    "was seen in 2df observations .",
    "these interference fringes were attributed to fractures within fibres , which resulted in air - gaps akin to micro etalons .",
    "fringing occurred in two flavours , a stable mode which could be removed via a flat field , and an unstable mode which could not .",
    "typically unstable fringing indicated a fibre which would soon break or a fibre button which was about to shed its prism . despite efforts to avoid the recurrence of fringing in fibres , a substantial number of  fibres currently exhibit unstable fringing .",
    "detailed analysis shows that the fringing stabilises with time but instability is provoked by positioning the damaged fibres .",
    "a detailed investigation of the characteristics of the fringing suggests that the fracture resides between the front face of the prism at prime focus and the anchor point for the fibre at the bottom of its 2df retractor and not within the body of the 38 m fibre cable , or within .    at this time",
    "it is believed that the root cause of the fibre fracturing , which appeared mostly between december 2005 and january 2006 during an extreme heat wave , and which has been observed to be stable since mid january 2006 , is differential expansion of the steel ferrule and the fibre at the fibre button , which has introduced an air gap between prism and fibre while still leaving the prism securely attached to its ferrule .",
    "further investigation is under way but if confirmed , the correct solution is the relatively simple task of re - terminating the affected fibres , an operation which would be performed as a matter of course during the life of  to repair the occasional damaged fibre .",
    "the reason for the reduced sensitivity of the blue arm ( currently running at @xmath650% ) is unclear .",
    "correction of the minor problems listed in this section will account for a 10 - 20% gain .",
    "further investigations are under way at this time to determine the source of the efficiency loss .",
    "likely culprits are an incorrect coating on an optical surface , poor ccd sensitivity or poor dichroic performance on reflection .      the current calibration system is based on the original 2df system , whereby the observing field plate is illuminated by arc and flat lamps mounted in the top end chimney via two deployable flaps which are placed into the top end beam . this system allows wavelength calibration from a combination of fear , cuar , thar and cune hollow cathode lamps .",
    "results are currently measured to better than a tenth of a pixel .",
    "detailed investigations show that this limit to the calibration accuracy , which impacts strongly on the accuracy of sky subtraction when using dedicated sky fibres ( see section [ sec : sky ] ) , is governed primarily by the difference in @xmath7-ratio between the arc lamp illumination and science observations .",
    "this issue was suspected with the 2df system but was not a measurable defect until the advent of .",
    "a program to implement an upgraded calibration system , whereby the telescope pupil is point sampled with arc light , probably by a fibre fed system , is under way . observations at redder wavelengths , where sufficient night sky oh air - glow lines are found ( such as the calcium triplet region typically used to study stellar radial velocities ) are not degraded by the use of the current system since the oh lines are used as a secondary calibrator during data reduction .",
    "variations in the full field point spread function ( psf ) contribute enormously to poor sky subtraction and were a significant defect in the 2df spectrograph system . from the start",
    "has been designed around achieving a stable psf as a function of wavelength .",
    "the observed instrument psf is found to be surprisingly gaussian in character .",
    "full width half maximum ( fwhm ) varies slightly with wavelength , as expected , and from grating to grating ( due to variations in grating character ) but is satisfactory and stable at @xmath63.4 pixels .",
    "this quality psf is a key factor in achieving the 1% sky subtraction often seen in  data to date .",
    "instabilities occasionally seen in the quality of sky subtraction may be due to subtle departures from a uniform psf across the entire ccd field , and may require a psf matching routine to achieve aaomega s ultimate sky subtraction performance , a task that is made significantly easier from a high quality starting point .",
    "frosting has been observed on the coldest surfaces ( including the field flatteners ) .",
    "this is due to `` moisture '' adsorbed on the large surface area of internal surfaces during camera fabrication .",
    "when the cameras are evacuated and cooled this slowly migrates to the coldest surfaces and forms the observed frost .",
    "this frosting has been dropping with time , with the aid of a regime of dry nitrogen purging and thermally cycling , and is now minimal .",
    "the level will be monitored over the coming months to assess the ultimate level that will be achievable .",
    "an essential part of the instrument is comprehensive software for preparing fields and reducing data .",
    "the 2df field configuration software package has been updated to cater for aaomega , and a new version is being tested which uses simulated annealing@xmath8}}$ ] to find the most efficient allocation of fibres to targets .",
    "the 2dfdr data reduction package has been comprehensively overhauled , with many improvements and new features added :    * a secondary wavelength calibration off sky lines in the extracted spectra is now implemented ; this greatly improves both sky subtraction and radial velocity precision * tramline fitting and spectrum identification is now fully automated using pattern matching based on the eight missing spectra where the guide fibres would be * splicing of low dispersion red and blue spectra is now incorporated * the software now works on ` fits ` files without conversion to ` ndf ` format * data for partially overlapping fields can now be seamlessly combined on an object - by - object basis    further improvements are scheduled , including crude spectrophotometric calibration from flux standards and improved self - consistent scattered light subtraction .",
    "began routine operations in february 2006 .",
    "a small number of outstanding sub - systems still require integration and a short program of simple upgrades , suggested during commissioning , will be undertaken over the next six months with the goal of recovering the full  design specification . in the longer term",
    "the aao is currently considering the upgrade path for .",
    "the success of the 2df system and the broad utility of the  design suggests the possibility of an infrared upgrade to .",
    "the proposed project , aaomicron , is currently in the early stages of specification , with the intention to move to a full feasibility study in the later half of 2006 .",
    "aaomicron would reuse the 2df wide field corrector and adc ( providing close to the full 2degree field of view ) and  fibre runs , all of which have been fortuitously constructed from materials which allow operation in the _ zj _ and _ h _ ir bands .",
    "aaomicron would operate at wavelengths short of 1.8@xmath9 m due to the emissivity of the  fibres at longer wavelengths .",
    "a simplified , unarticulated copy of the  collimator and camera system would be placed inside a -50@xmath10 cold room to suppress thermal background .",
    "the use of a rockwell hawaii2 ir array , preferably using the new _ k _ blind technology making the chip insensitive to thermal emission long ward of 1.7 - 1.8@xmath9 m would allow the camera to operate at higher temperature than typical for a _ k _ band system , and allow between 100 - 200  fibres to be projected onto the detector at one time using an only slightly modifed aaomega camera design . with a field of view @xmath1116 that of the subaru - fmos system , and a fibre aperture",
    "more closely matched to the typical scale length of redshift z@xmath121.0 galaxies , the aaomicron system would represent an interesting complement to currently available ir spectroscopy facilities , and would be the survey instrument of choice in a number of fields .",
    "the aaomicron will be presented to the australian community for consideration in may 2006 and , if supported , will proceed to the design study phase in the second half of 2006 .",
    "it is envisaged that aaomicron could be in operation by late 2010 .",
