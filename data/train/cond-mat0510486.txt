    "basic research in the physical sciences , especially in condensed matter physics , can result in important developments in applied physics and engineering .",
    "recently scientists draw theirs attention to the physics of hybrid structures .",
    "both ( ferromagnet)/(magnetic semiconductor)@xcite and ( superconductor)/(magnetic semiconductor),@xcite are promising hybrids that join magnetic and electronic properties in one unit . using magnetic semiconductor or more precisely diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) , e.g. , , instead of a conventional alloy ( cdte , gaas ) amplifies some physical properties which are extremely small in a ( ferromagnet or superconductor)/(conventional semiconductor ) hybrid@xcite .",
    "the effect that lies the foundation of such amplification is called giant zeeman effect@xcite and is due to the sp - d exchange interaction between delocalized ( s , p ) and localized ( d ) carries .",
    "let us concentrate on the ( ferromagnet)/(dms ) hybrid .",
    "when dms is buried below array of magnetic islands , local field produced by each island is penetrating dms structure .",
    "dms acts itself as an amplifier and multiplies this field by huge factor ( typically by hundred times but in sub - kelvin temperatures even by thousand times ) . in this way",
    "quasi - particles fill large , effective `` potential '' proportional to this local field and which acts as a trap for them . depending on the local distribution of the magnetic field",
    "the effective potential can reveal one - dimensional@xcite or zero - dimensional@xcite character . in this report",
    "i analyze the role of shape of the islands@xcite on the distribution of induced field so on possibility of localization of quasi - particles .",
    "micro- and nano - magnets of different kind of shapes have already been investigated experimentally : diamond - like magnets@xcite , cylinder - like magnets@xcite as well as rectangle - like magnets@xcite are examples of them .",
    "typically , the structures of arrays of magnets is characterized by atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) , the magnetic properties are studied by superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetization measurements and in order to obtain local microscopic information on the domain structure of the individual islands , magnetic - force microscopy ( mfm ) measurements is performed .",
    "recently we have presented@xcite theoretical analysis of the absorption spectrum as well as distribution of the local magnetic field induced in ( ferromagnet)/(dms ) hybrid composed of rectangular and/or cylindrical island and dms quantum well structure .",
    "we have shown that depending on the distribution of the magnetic field it is possible to localize quasi - particle in this type of system .     and",
    "the width @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is the same for all three shapes . ]    in the next section i present theoretical assumptions concerning the system as well as describe procedure of calculation of magnetic field induced by a magnets .",
    "then i analyze results in more details and draw conclusions .",
    "i considered three types of flat islands which volumes @xmath2 .",
    "shape @xmath3 is one of ellipse- , diamond- or rectangle shapes as shown on fig .",
    "[ figshapes ] and @xmath4 is height of the magnet . in my coordinate system , magnet is lying on the xy plane and i assumed that the aspect ratio between its length @xmath5 and its width @xmath0 equals to three , @xmath1 , and the aspect ratio between its width @xmath0 and its height @xmath6 is assumed to be 10 , @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the following numbers fulfil the assumptions : length @xmath5=6  @xmath8 m , width @xmath0=2  @xmath8 m and height @xmath6=0.2  @xmath8 m - so magnet is called a micro - magnet .",
    "islands are magnetized uniformly in the x - direction as indicated on fig .",
    "[ figshapes ] .",
    "z - component of induced magnetic field was calculated at points @xmath9 on the xy plane at the distance @xmath10 below islands .",
    "magnetic field @xmath11 is a function of all four lengths : @xmath5 , @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath12 and is proportional to the saturation magnetization @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "as can be checked by solving magneto - static maxwell s equations@xcite the following scaling is fulfilled : @xmath15 which allows us to work with dimensionless lengths indicated on fig .",
    "[ figshapes ] and in the following presentation .",
    "magnetic field coming from uniformly magnetized cuboid can be calculated analytically as shown for example in ref .  .",
    "i use this fact and approximate volume of the whole magnet @xmath16 by a sum of volumes of small cuboids @xmath17 , , which are totally included in the volume of island , @xmath18 .",
    "then , using the fact that maxwell equations are linear , i can approximate total magnetic field @xmath11 at point @xmath19 by a sum of partial fields @xmath20 produced by each cuboid @xmath17 : @xmath21 @xmath22 that approximate real field @xmath23 ( for the rectangular shaped magnet @xmath24 ) depends on the division of the volume @xmath16 .",
    "i used small volumes @xmath25 to represent each cuboid and assured that @xmath26 .",
    "typically @xmath27 which have given us smooth magnetic field @xmath22 after performing summation as required in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) . in the further discussion symbol @xmath23 will be used instead of @xmath22 to simplify notation .",
    "in order to compare results obtained for all three shapes i set @xmath5=6  @xmath8 m , @xmath0=2  @xmath8 m and @xmath6=0.2  @xmath8 m in the case of all types of islands .",
    "magnetic field @xmath23 was calculated at the same distance @xmath12=10  nm=0.01  @xmath28 below each micro - magnet .",
    "each micro - magnet was magnetized uniformly to the value of the saturation magnetization of iron @xmath13=1740  @xmath29 . in tab .",
    "[ ms ] i collected saturation magnetization of few other substances .",
    ".saturation magnetization at t=0  k of different substances in cgs units and si units taken from ref .  .",
    "room temperature values are shown in brackets .",
    "results presented in the report scale easly with @xmath13 , e.g , when we use @xmath13 of nickel instead of @xmath13 of fe then induced field is almost four times smaller . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     results scales simply with @xmath13 and it is straightforward to obtain distribution of the magnetic field of other substances by multiplying results by the factor @xmath13(substance)/@xmath13(fe ) which i show in the last column of tab .  [ ms ] .",
    "for example , when considering mnas island instead of fe island , the results have to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath30 .    fig .  [ fig2d ]",
    "shows contour plot of the z - component of the magnetic field , @xmath31 , of ellipse shape micro - magnet ( panel a ) , of diamond shape micro - magnet ( panel b ) and of rectangle shape magnet ( panel c ) .",

    "ellipse , diamond and rectangular in the xy plane at distance @xmath12=10  nm below iron islands .",
    "i used gray scale : black ( white ) region denotes negative ( positive ) values of @xmath31 .",
    "figure reflects the distribution of the magnetic charge on the surface of islands . ]    as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] distribution of magnetic field on the xy plane is highly position - dependant and shape - dependant .",
    "large fields are induced in proximity of magnetic poles below and above them . in the further discussion",
    "i will use magneto - static language and use notion of the density of magnetic charge @xmath33 .",
    "total magnetic charge is the same for all shapes of islands because i have chosen identical @xmath13 for all types micro - magnets .",
    "magnetization @xmath34 , and density of magnetic charge @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a unit vector normal to the surface at point @xmath19 .",
    "it means that in the case of diamond and rectangle shapes @xmath37 is a constant on the surface of micro - magnets because normal to its surface does not depend on the position . in the case of diamond - shape magnet @xmath37",
    "is @xmath38 times smaller than @xmath37 of rectangle - shape magnet because surface area is @xmath38 time larger in the case of diamond - shape magnet .",
    "from this fact we expect that magnitude of @xmath31 is about @xmath39 smaller in the case of diamond shape then of rectangle shape .",
    "as we shall see later three dimensional plots confirm this fact . in the case of ellipse - shape magnet normal to the surface changes with position on the surface",
    "so does @xmath33 .",
    "[ fig2d ] reflects the distribution of magnetic charge .    to gain more knowladge about distribution of the field now i present three dimensional plots of @xmath31 in the region of its large value .     around magnetic pole of ellipse - like micromagnet ( @xmath5=6  @xmath8 m , @xmath0=2  @xmath8 m , @xmath6=0.2  @xmath8 m ) in the xy plane at distance @xmath12=10  nm below the magnet .",
    "induced field is localize at point ( 0 , -3 ) on xy plane . ]",
    "figures  [ figoval ] , [ figdiam ] and [ figrect ] show z - component of the magnetic field , @xmath31 , that is produced by the micro - magnets of ellipse , diamond and rectangle shape , respectively .",

    "we see again that in the case of ellipse magnet , fig .",

    "the largest value of @xmath31 is found at point ( 0 , -3 ) . ]    in the case of diamond - like magnet , fig .",
    "[ figdiam ] , magnetic field is localized around point ( 0 , -3 ) , too , but the amplitude is much lower then in the case of ellipse magnet .",
