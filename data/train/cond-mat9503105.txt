    "the heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath0 has attracted a great deal of attention because of its remarkable low temperature phase diagram .",
    "the key features are : ( i ) the existence of two superconducting phases in zero field with a small separation of the transition temperatures , @xmath9 , compared to @xmath10 , ( ii ) the existence of three superconducting phases in a magnetic field ( iii ) with phase boundaries that meet at a tetracritical point @xmath11 on the upper critical field line.@xcite interpretations of this phase diagram fall into two main categories of theoretical models : ( i ) theories based on two symmetry un - related order parameters which are accidentally nearly degenerate,@xcite and ( ii ) models based on a single multi - component order parameter belonging to a higher dimensional representation in which the degeneracy is lifted by a weak symmetry breaking field ( sbf).@xcite upt@xmath0 is a close - packed hexagonal crystal with two formula units per unit cell ; the point group is @xmath12 .",
    "two candidates for an intrinsic sbf have been identified experimentally .",
    "neutron scattering experiments show that upt@xmath0 develops an anti - ferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath13 , below a nel temperature of @xmath14 k.@xcite the magnitude of the ordered moment is small , @xmath15 per u atom , and is directed in the basal plane thus breaking the in - plane hexagonal symmetry .",
    "evidence in support of an afm symmetry breaking field was found from pressure studies of the superconductivity and afm order .",
    "heat capacity measurements show that the splitting of the superconducting transitions is suppressed under a hydrostatic pressure of @xmath16 kbar,@xcite while neutron scattering measurements show the supression of afm order at roughly the same pressure , @xmath17 kbar.@xcite however , the observed magnetic bragg peaks indicate finite - range afm order with a correlation length @xmath18 depending on the crystal , which has led to discussion of whether or not the afm order is intrinsic property of upt@xmath0.@xcite alternatively , a macroscopic strain field was proposed@xcite as a possible sbf based on the experimental observation of a complex incommensurate structural modulation in upt@xmath0 with characteristic wavelengths of order 10 - 50 lattice spacings and typical domain sizes of order @xmath19 . however , these structural modulations seem unlikely to be the principal sbf responsible for the double transition since the high formation temperature suggests that they persist to pressures well above that required to destroy the double transition and the afm order.@xcite    in a recent article , keller , _",
    "et al._@xcite reported the observation of a weak hexagonal modulation of the upper critical field of upt@xmath0 as a function of the orientation of the field in the basal plane .",
    "the key features of these measurements are : ( i ) the small magnitude of the oscillations , @xmath20 , ( ii ) persistence of the oscillations for @xmath6 , and ( iii ) the change in sign of the oscillations for @xmath7 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the temperature at the tetracritical point . in this paper",
    "i show that hexagonal oscillations such as these are a consequence of the in - plane afm symmetry breaking field above @xmath1 that is responsible for the double transition in upt@xmath0 .",
    "in order to sharpen the argument i briefly review the important theoretical results on the anisotropy of the in - plane upper critical field in _ any _ perfectly hexagonal superconductor .",
    "first consider a hexagonal superconductor described by a one - component order parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "this case includes conventional superconductors for which @xmath23 is invariant under @xmath12 , as well as unconventional cases where @xmath23 changes sign under one or more symmetry operations . in the ginzburg - landau ( gl )",
    "limit the free energy functional for any superconducting order parameter belonging to a one - dimensional representation is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and repeated indices are summed over @xmath26 .",
    "an important point here is that the gl functional has an accidental symmetry ; to second order in the gradients there are no terms in the functional that differentiate hexagonal symmetry ( @xmath12 ) from cylindrical symmetry ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "consequently , the upper critical field is independent of the orientation of @xmath28 in the basal plane ; @xmath29 .",
    "hexagonal anisotropy of @xmath30 shows up only at lower temperature when higher - order gradients become significant .",
    "the lowest - order contribution to the free energy functional that is invariant under @xmath12 , but not @xmath27 , is @xmath31 it is straight - forward to show that this term leads to hexagonal oscillations of @xmath32 of the form , @xmath33 to leading order in @xmath34 .",
    "the key point is that the hexagonal anisotropy vanishes as @xmath35 as @xmath6 .",
    "this result is not limited to superconductors with a one - dimensional order parameter .",
    "burlachkov@xcite showed that @xmath30 is isotropic for fields in the basal plane , in the gl limit , for _ any _ of the two - dimensional representations of @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the gl functional can be written as @xmath36 where the order parameter @xmath37 transforms according to one of the 2d irreducible representations ( e@xmath38 or e@xmath39 ) of @xmath12 .",
    "the isotropy of @xmath30 in the gl limit again follows because to second - order in the gradients and in @xmath37 the gl functional is invariant under the larger group , @xmath27 .",
    "again , one has to examine sixth - order terms ( therefore , of order @xmath35 ) in order to develop hexagonal anisotropy in @xmath30.@xcite    recently , mineev examined gl models based on two accidentally nearly degenerate 1d representations.@xcite such a models have been investigated by several authors@xcite as candidate theories of the h - t phase diagram of upt@xmath0 . an important feature of these models is that they do not rely on the coupling of the order parameter to a sbf that reflects a weak breaking of hexagonal symmetry above @xmath1 .",
    "the basic result for the anisotropy of @xmath30 is the same ; hexagonal oscillations vanish as @xmath35 near @xmath1.@xcite thus , the experimental observation of hexagonal oscillations of @xmath30 in upt@xmath0 for @xmath6 is in conflict with any gl model of the superconducting phases that is based on perfect hexagonal symmetry above @xmath1 .    below i",
    "show that hexagonal oscillations of @xmath32 do appear in the gl limit ( @xmath40 ) for the class of models based on a 2d superconducting order parameter coupled to an afm symmetry breaking field present above @xmath1 .",
    "it may initially seem odd that one obtains six - fold oscillations from an afm order parameter that _ reduces _ the symmetry from hexagonal to orthorhombic .",
    "six - fold oscillations of @xmath30 are shown to be a natural consequence of a small in - plane anisotropy energy of the afm order parameter , while orthorhombic anisotropy of @xmath5 appears in the limit of large in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the free energy functional for a 2d superconducting order parameter , @xmath41 , coupled to an afm order parameter , @xmath4 , is the sum of ( i ) @xmath42 , which represents the gl functional for the superconducting order parameter , ( ii ) @xmath43 , which is the free energy for the afm phase above @xmath1 , and ( iii ) @xmath44 , which represents the coupling between superconductivity and anti - ferromagnetism .",
    "the general form for the superconducting gl functional in the absence of a sbf has been discussed by many authors@xcite , and is given in eq .",
    "first , consider the magnetic free energy above @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath45 the mean - field approximation for the magnetic free energy functional should be reliable provided the correct magnetic ordering has been identified .",
    "i assume an order parameter , @xmath46 , describing afm correlations between neighboring u atoms in a double unit cell , and start from a landau functional for the magnetic free energy density , @xmath47 the first line of terms is invariant under the full spin - rotation group .",
    "they are primarily due to exchange interactions in typical magnetic materials .",
    "thus , neglecting the anisotropy terms , one has @xmath48 for the magnitude of the afm order parameter in the exchange approximation .",
    "the third term represents the leading order uniaxial anisotropy energy .",
    "anisotropy energies arise from spin - orbit interactions and are typically small compared to the exchange terms .",
    "i assume @xmath49 which favors in - plane afm order .",
    "the sixth - order term in @xmath4 is the leading term in a gl expansion for the in - plane anistropy energy .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy energy is assumed to be a small perturbation to the afm exchange energy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath50 in the absence of an external field the in - plane anistropy energy leads to six degenerate minimum energy orientations for @xmath4 , which are equivalent to three commensurate wavevectors in a spin - density wave description .",
    "there are two sets of preferred orientations depending on the sign of the coefficient @xmath51 . if @xmath52 the moments prefer the set of alignments , @xmath53 that includes the @xmath54 axis , while for @xmath55 the set of minimum energy orientations are shifted by @xmath56 , and includes the @xmath57 axis [ i use the notation in ref . ] .",
    "the zeeman energy is quadratic in @xmath28 for an antiferromagnet and prefers the afm order parameter to be aligned perpendicular to the field ( @xmath58).@xcite thus , for a general orientation of the field in the basal plane there is competition between the anisotropy energy and the zeeman energy .",
    "the field at which the anisotropy energy is comparable to the zeeman energy defines a cross - over field scale , @xmath59 at low fields , @xmath60 , the afm order parameter is essentially locked by the in - plane anisotropy energy to an equilibrium orientation , @xmath61 .",
    "however , for @xmath62 the zeeman energy dominates the anisotropy energy and the orientation of the magnetization will adjust to remain approximately perpendicular to @xmath28 .",
    "this case is particularly relevant to the discussion of the hexagonal oscillations of @xmath5 . in the limit",
    "@xmath63 the orientation of @xmath4 is fixed by the field , @xmath64 , or @xmath65 .",
    "the magnitude of the staggered moment is then to a very good approximation determined by minimizing the afm free energy @xmath66 at _ fixed _",
    "orientation @xmath67 . treating the anisotropy energy as a perturbation leads to a small correction to the exchange approximation for the afm order parameter ; @xmath68 . retaining the leading order corrections to the stationarity condition",
    "gives a hexagonal modulation of the afm order parameter , @xmath69 this modulation of the afm order parameter by the anisotropy potential leads to a hexagonal modulation of the upper critical field in the sbf model for the double superconducting transition .",
    "i assume a specific 2d model , based on an e@xmath70 order parameter , which i discussed recently in the context of the h - t phase diagram.@xcite in this model the gradient coefficients @xmath71 for weak hexagonal anisotropy ; in perfect hexagonal systems , which vanishes for @xmath6 as @xmath35 .",
    "this same fermi surface anisotropy is responsible for the deviation of @xmath72 from zero in the @xmath73 representations.@xcite ] however , for in - plane magnetic fields the principal arguments that follow apply to any of the 2d models .",
    "the parameters of the gl functional in eq .",
    "[ f_sc ] are calculated from fermi - liquid theory.@xcite the gradient coefficients , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are determined by the density of states , @xmath76 , and the anisotropic components of the fermi velocity , @xmath77 .",
    "these coefficients determine the uniaxial anisotropy of @xmath78 and @xmath5 .",
    "the other coefficients , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , determine the condensation energy ; @xmath1 is the transition temperature in absence of coupling to the afm order parameter .    to calculate the hexagonal anisotropy of @xmath5 near @xmath1",
    "i need the the terms in the free energy that describe the coupling of the superconductivity to the afm order parameter .",
    "the leading order symmetry breaking terms are@xcite @xmath81 the first term is responsible for the double transition in zero field , while the gradient terms generate an asymmetry in the slopes of the two branches of @xmath5 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "combining the coupling terms with the superconducting free energy ( eq . [ f_sc ] ) gives , @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "the fourth - order terms are omitted since they are not relevant to the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "the sbf field generates a splitting of @xmath1 and the gradient coefficients , @xmath86 the upper critical field is obtained from solutions of the linearized gl equations , @xmath87 the resulting value of @xmath32 is then the larger value of the solutions for the two branches , @xmath88 for @xmath89 the upper critical field has a kink at the temperature @xmath22 ( tetracritical point ) .",
    "the solution @xmath90 denotes the branch with @xmath82 and @xmath91 denotes the branch with @xmath83 .",
    "the two branches correspond to transitions from the normal state to a superconducting state with order parameters , @xmath92 for @xmath82 and @xmath93 for @xmath83 .",
    "note that @xmath94 depends implicitly on the orientation of the field , @xmath95 , through the afm order parameter @xmath96 .",
    "hexagonal oscillations of @xmath32 result from the modulation of the afm order parameter by the sixth - order anisotropy energy . in the limit @xmath97 ,",
    "the extrapolation points , @xmath98 , show a hexagonal modulation .",

    "note that the modulation of the two extrapolation points , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , is out of phase by @xmath104 .",
    "this explains the change in phase of the oscillations of @xmath32 for temperatures above and below the tetracritical point .",
    "figure 1 shows the upper critical field for two orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "note the change in @xmath32 upon rotating the field from @xmath105 ( minimum of the anisotropy energy ) to @xmath106 ( maximum of the anisotropy energy ) .",
    "this change in phase of the oscillations for @xmath107 and @xmath108 has the same origin as the splitting of @xmath1 in zero field by the afm symmetry breaking field .",
    "the oscillations are small in magnitude , @xmath109 and weakly dependent on temperature , except for @xmath110 , where the oscillations change sign ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and for temperatures _ very _ close to @xmath1 where @xmath111 drops below the anisotropy field , @xmath112 . from the magnitude of the hexagonal anisotropy measured by keller , _",

    ", @xmath116,@xcite gives @xmath117 .",

    "these terms generate temperature dependent amplitudes for the oscillations of the two branches of @xmath32 as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath32 obtained above are for fields large compared to the anisotropy field , @xmath112 .",
    "while it is reasonable to assume that @xmath112 is very low , it is non - zero and so provides a cross - over field below which the hexagonal oscillations of @xmath30 should vanish . for @xmath62",
    "there are also corrections to the ` high - field ' limit discussed above .",
    "these corrections , as well as the low - field cross - over behavior , are obtained from the minimization of the afm free energy functional with respect to both @xmath96 and @xmath120 for fixed @xmath95 .",
    "the stationarity condition @xmath121 generates , @xmath122 to leading order in @xmath123 .",
    "the second term in eq . [ euler_ms ] originates from the zeeman energy .",
    "the relation between the orientation of the applied field ( @xmath95 ) and that of the afm order parameter ( @xmath120 ) is determined by the stationarity condition @xmath124 , @xmath125 in the zero - field limit one obtains the expected result that the afm order parameter is locked to the lattice at the minima of the anisotropy energy given by @xmath126 for @xmath52 ; the solutions @xmath127 correspond to maxima of the anisotropy energy . in the opposite limit , @xmath128 , the afm order parameter is oriented at @xmath129 relative to the field ; the other solutions at @xmath130 corrrespond to maxima of the zeeman energy .",
    "for @xmath131 the orientation of @xmath4 is no longer strictly orthogonal to @xmath28 .",
    "the deviation , @xmath132 , oscillates with an amplitude proportional to @xmath133 , @xmath134 this phase shift vanishes near a minimum of the anisotropy energy and is maximum at orientations of @xmath28 corresponding to a maximum in the slope of the anisotropy energy ( _ i.e. _ maximum anisotropy torque on @xmath4 ) .",
    "this correction , combined with the correction from the zeeman energy , gives @xmath135    @xmath136    for the modulation of the afm order parameter parameter .",
