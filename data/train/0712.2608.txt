    "[ fig : coeff]a shows that the spin - bath dissipation rate @xmath64 , eq .  , decreases with temperature . this initially surprising result",
    "is easily explained . while a harmonic oscillator can absorb an infinite amount of energy , there are only two energy levels for a spin-@xmath0 particle .",
    "it follows that , as the bath temperature is raised , the spin bath saturates quickly and the dissipative influence on the central system must decrease when compared with that of the oscillator bath , whose dissipation rate is temperature - independent ( for linear quantum brownian motion ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath82 temperature dependence of the spin - bath dissipation rate has been explicitly observed in systems such as glasses @xcite where dissipation is mainly caused by interactions between phonon modes and tls @xcite .",
    "a similar argument also allows us to understand the absence of any temperature dependence of the normal - diffusion coefficient @xmath65 [ see eq .  ] for the spin bath and thus of the rate of spatial decoherence ( fig .  [",

    "shows that for quantum brownian motion this rate increases with temperature as @xmath83 ( and linearly with @xmath16 in the high - temperature limit of the caldeira ",
    "leggett model @xcite ) .",
    "this increase is due to the fact that , as the temperature is raised , increasingly excited energy levels will be occupied in each harmonic oscillator , and thus the characteristic wavelengths present in the bath will decrease .",
    "shorter environmental wavelengths mean that the bath will be able to better resolve the position of the central system , leading to stronger decoherence ( localization ) of superpositions of well - separated positions .",
    "the quick saturation of the spin bath with increasing temperature implies that the characteristic wavelengths can not become significantly shorter , resulting for our model in a temperature - independent expression for @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that the spin - bath decoherence rate @xmath65 has a constant component implies that there is a heating source in the oscillator ",
    "spin model .",
    "this term in the master equation drives a diffusion process in the momentum and thus causes the average kinetic energy of the oscillator to increase linearly in time at a rate of at least @xmath76 .",
    "this is likely to be a problematic source of heating in micron - scale ion traps .",
    "as this is independent of temperature , it will be apparent even if no systematic dissipation is observable ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the discussion in the previous section indicates that the temperature dependence of the damping and dissipation rates arise from the fact that the bath seen by the central oscillator can not absorb an arbitrarily large amount of energy .",
    "we are thus led to consider an extreme case in which the oscillator is coupled to only a single tls which is itself weakly coupled to a bosonic bath . as mentioned in the introduction , both in micron - scale , cryogenic ion traps and in ghz qems ( the frequency regime relevant to the observation of quantum effects ) it is likely that only a few tls take part in the dynamics , rather than a tls environment with continuous spectrum as used in @xcite .",
    "this lends particular experimental relevance to the single - tls model considered here .",
    "for example , our model could represent a single charge trap electrostatically coupled to a nanomechanical resonator , with the charge trap itself coupled to johnson ",
    "nyquist electrical noise in the surrounding circuit .",
    "we begin with a single vibrational degree of freedom ( the central harmonic oscillator @xmath4 ) coupled to a single spin-@xmath0-particle ( tls ) , @xmath85 where @xmath86 are dimensionless position and momentum operators . in the case of a realization of the model as a charge trap",
    ", @xmath87 refers to two distinct charge configurations of a single microscopic trap in one of the electrodes near a nanomechanical resonator or trapped ion .",
    "we could think of this as some kind of double well , in which case the eigenstates of @xmath87 refer to states localized on one side of the barrier or the other .",
    "the tunnel - split ground states under the barrier are eigenstates of @xmath88 and the tunnel splitting is @xmath89 . if we define the eigenstates of @xmath88 by @xmath90 , then we can define the `` bit - flip '' operator as @xmath91 .",
    "we expect that the tls remains close to thermodynamic equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature @xmath16 even in the presence of the coupling to the central oscillator .",
    "thus we assume that its state at all times can be approximated by the thermal state @xmath92 where @xmath93 the dynamical process that maintains the tls in thermodynamic equilibrium could be quite obscure .",
    "however , a simple model can be given by weakly coupling the single tls to a bosonic bath at temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the coupling is capacitive , @xmath94 while the free hamiltonian for the bath is a sum over harmonic oscillators , each with canonical coordinates @xmath95 and frequency @xmath96 .",

    "finally , the parameter @xmath103 is defined by @xmath104 it is easy to see that in the absence of the coupling to the oscillator , the steady state for the tls implied by eq .   is simply given by eq .  .",
    "we can now calculate a heating rate for the oscillator .",
    "we do this by adiabatic elimination @xcite of the tls , i.e. , we assume that @xmath105 so that the tls remains in steady state slaved to the motion of the oscillator .",
