    "the gravitational interaction of any planets with the debris dust produces gaps and peaks in the dust spatial distribution that provides clues to the underlying planetary system @xcite .",
    "however , the dust emission in most debris systems remains unresolved , and the dust spatial distribution is often inferred by modeling the composite spectral energy distribution . in practice",

    "we adopted equatorial coordinates of ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) = ( 12:19:06.50,+16:32:53.87 ) for equinox and epoch j2000 , with a proper motion of ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) = ( @xmath7175.65,@xmath7148.28)mas  yr@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the emission within a @xmath18 box centered on the stellar position is @xmath19mjy , with an additional 15% calibration uncertainty (  [ obs ] ) .",
    "the 1.3 mm emission is resolved into a partial ring that encircles the stellar position .",
    "the locations of the emission peaks are robust to various calibration schemes and data reduction approaches , but the magnitude of the peaks and the gap in the northwestern part of the ring are somewhat variable with such changes .",
    "the two brightest positions in the ring are located nearly equidistant from the stellar position on opposite sides of the star .",
    "the northeast peak is located 3.3  from the star at a position angle ( east of north ) of pa=48 , and the southwest peak is offset by 3.5  from the stellar position at pa=190 .",
    "the projected distance of the dust peaks from the star is @xmath197au .",
    "the clumpy structure observed in the carma 1.3 mm continuum image is in contrast to the smooth , continuous ring observed in scattered light at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "further , the scattered - light image peaks at a larger orbital radius ( 130au ) than the dust continuum image .",
    "the differences in the radial distribution is qualitatively consistent with the notion that small grains , which are efficient at scattering , are ejected by radiation pressure from the system , while the larger grains are found at smaller radii @xcite .",
    "the morphological differences of the 350  and 1.3 mm images can be attributed to resolution in that if we produce the 1.3 mm carma image with a 8  fwhm taper to yield a 9  synthesized beam , the resulting image is centrally peaked on the stellar position and is similar in size to the 350  image . in detail , other published , resolved , ( sub-)millimeter images are inconsistent with the cso and carma images .",
    "@xcite report that the 450  emission at 8  resolution is offset from the stellar position by 4.4 . since the 350  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cso ] ) and the 850  image @xcite are centered on the stellar position to within 2 , we assume the offset in the 450  image is a pointing error . a more significant discrepancy is seen between the carma 1.3 mm image and the ovro 3 mm image @xcite . the 3 mm emission was resolved at @xmath20 resolution with a fwhm size of @xmath21 .",
    "we have smoothed the 1.3 mm image to the resolution of the 3 mm image , and the ring structure is not apparent at the coarser resolution . however , the apparent ellipticity in the 3 mm image is nearly orthogonal to the clumps in the 1.3 mm image .",
    "since the 1.3 mm image has higher signal to noise , finer resolution , and more baselines for better imaging , we view that image as a more reliable tracer of the debris structure .",
    "assuming gas drag is negligible , the orbital lifetime of dust grains in an optically thin disk is limited by poynting - robertson drag , collision grinding of particles combined with radiation blowout of small grains , and stellar - wind drag .",
    "@xcite have shown that for debris disks detectable with current instrumentation , collisional grinding of particles to the radiation blowout size dominates over poynting - robertson drag in removing mass from the debris system .",
    "stellar - wind drag may also be important @xcite , but the magnitude of this effect is poorly constrained at young ages @xcite .",
    "if a collisional cascade has produced the dust particles in the hd107146 debris disk , the expected particle size distribution is @xmath22 @xcite for grain sizes larger than the radiation blowout size ( radius @xmath10.5  for a solar - type star ) . in practice",
    ", the truncated distribution will produce a `` wavy '' pattern of particle sizes superimposed on the power - law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we neglect that complication . for silicate grains @xcite larger than the blowout size , half of the flux density at a wavelength of 1.3 mm will be emitted by grains larger than @xmath10.5 mm in radius for a @xmath23 size distribution .",
    "the ratio of radiation to gravitational forces ( @xmath24 ) for these particles is @xmath24@xmath10.001 , indicating radiation pressure has negligible effect on their dynamics .    by the above arguments , the millimeter - wave emission traces predominantly millimeter - sized particles where the dynamics are controlled by particle collisions and gravity",
    "this is consistent with clumpy structure observed in the debris disk , as radiation forces will tend to produce a smooth spatial distribution of particles .",
    "the millimeter - wave emission should then trace the location of the planetesimals in the hd107146 disk @xcite .",
    "the radius of the observed debris emission implies the presence of planetesimals at an orbital radius of @xmath197au .",
    "moreover , the dual emission peaks in the carma image presents intriguing possibilities for the presumed planetary system around hd107146 .",
    "the dust emission peaks are distributed nearly ( but not precisely ) symmetrically around the star , and may be caused by dust trapped in mean - motion resonance with an orbiting star or planet .",
    "in fact , the image of hd107146 looks quite similar to the @xmath24@xmath10.002 , 3:2 resonance image of @xcite . in detail , the two main dust peaks and the star are not co - linear , which may imply a planet of moderate eccentricity ( @xmath250.5 ) has trapped the dust in a 3:1 resonance @xcite . given that the clumps are located at 97au , such resonances would imply a planet between @xmath145 and 75  au .",
    "@xcite obtained adaptive optics images at @xmath02.2to search for companions to hd107146 .",
    "they place an upper mass limit of 10m@xmath26 to any companions at 74au .",
    "@xcite report that a similar limit of 10m@xmath26 persists inward to @xmath125au .",
    "thus these observations rule out the presence of a stellar companion at such a large radius , and suggest the structure in the debris disk is produced from the gravitational affects of a planetary system .",
    "could a planet have formed at @xmath145 - 75au that produced resonant structure in the debris disk ?",
    "@xcite have simulated the collision growth of planets and subsequent production of debris and find that planets on the size of @xmath12000 km ( @xmath10.01m@xmath27 ) are needed to excite the collisional cascade .",
    "the timescale to produce bodies of this size at 45 - 75au from collisional growth of planetesimals is @xmath150 - 225myr @xcite for planetesimal with low eccentricity ( @xmath28 ) and a surface density profile appropriate for the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite .",
    "for moderate eccentricities ( @xmath250.02 - 0.04 ) , the timescales are 2 to 4 times longer .",
    "similarly , @xcite simulated the collisional growth of objects at 40 - 47au and found that 1000 km sized objects can form in 10 - 50myr , and double in mass every 100myr to 1gyr .",
    "thus the timescale to form @xmath12000 km sized bodies , which are needed to initiate the collisional cascade , is roughly consistent with the age estimates of hd107146 .",
    "however , the planet is likely much larger than 2000 km in radius if the dust is trapped in a resonance . @xcite conducted numerical simulations to show that planets more massive than @xmath15m@xmath27 ( @xmath111,000 km in radius assuming a volume density comparable to the earth ) are needed to trap particles in outer mean motion resonances .",
    "the timescale to grow such objects by collisional growth is more than 1gyr at radii @xmath2945au @xcite , which is substantially older than hd107146 .",
    "the presence of a massive planet at large radii then requires formation mechanisms beyond collisional aggregation of planetesimals . for disk - to - star mass ratios of @xmath300.1 in the t  tauri phase ,",
    "marginally consistent with observations @xcite , planets may form by gravitational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "planets formed by this mechanism tend to be quite massive ( 1m@xmath31 or larger ) .",
    "@xcite argues that the cooling timescales are inconsistent with formation via this method unless the planet is both massive , @xmath15 - 10m@xmath26 , and distant , @xmath1100au , which is consistent with the distance and upper mass limit described above .",
    "another possibility is that the planet formed in the inner regions and migrated outwards , which may trap planetesimals and dust in resonant orbits @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism has been used to explain the structure and dynamics of the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling is needed to gain more insights on the planetary system around hd107146 and if migration can explain the clumpy structure observed in the surrounding debris disk .    in summary ,",
    "the young solar analog hd107146 is surrounded by a clumpy debris disk similar to those seen around vega and @xmath32eridani .",
    "the structure is suggestive of dynamical influence from a planet .",
    "the likely size and location of the presumed planet are inconsistent with formation by purely collisional aggregation of planetesimals and appeals to migration or formation via gravitational instability must be made .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for comments which improved this work .",
    "support for carma construction was derived from the gordon and betty moore foundation , the kenneth t. and eileen l. norris foundation , the associates of the california institute of technology , the states of california , illinois , and maryland , and the national science foundation .",
