    "three - electron quantum dots are expected to attract a lot of attention in the near future due to several developments , both experimental and theoretical .",

    "second , three - qubit electron spin devices are expected to exhibit enhanced efficiency@xcite for quantum - computing and quantum - information purposes compared to single - qubit and two - qubit ones .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out exact diagonalization ( exd ) studies for a three - electron single quantum dot under low and moderate magnetic fields . unlike previous exd studies@xcite that focused mainly on the ground states ( gss ) of circular quantum dots,@xcite we investigate , in addition , the excitation spectra for three electrons in quantum dots with a wide range of anisotropies .",
    "moreover , consideration of anisotropic quantum dots allows us to investigate the structure of the many - body wave functions with respect to strong - correlations effects , such as electron localization and formation of wigner molecules with a linear or zig - zag geometry .",
    "most importantly , we investigate here the feasibility of producing model quantum entangled states ( i.e. , the socalled @xmath2 states@xcite ) , which are often employed in the mathematical treatment of quantum information and which have been experimentally realized with ultracold atoms in linear ion traps.@xcite we note that a main factor motivating our investigations is the different nature of the entangling agent , namely , the electromagnetic field in the case of heavy ions versus the two - body coulomb interaction in the case of electrons .",
    "we further mention other recent proposals in the context of solid state electronic devices for producing three - qubit entanglement . in particular , a scheme based on non - interacting electron - hole excitations in the fermi sea",

    "[ enspcir ] the spectra are distorted , but they maintain the overall topology of the circular dot . as a result , we have been able to use the same pairs of labels in naming the different curves , even though the second label does not have the meaning of an angular momentum ( the total angular momentum is not conserved for @xmath113 ) .",
    "there are two main differences from the circular case : i ) the degeneracies at @xmath89 between the @xmath90 states are lifted , and ii ) there is a marked rounding of all the @xmath90 curves in the beginning , so that they do not intersect the vertical energy axis at sharp angles as is the case with fig .",
    "[ enspcir ] .",
    "this initial rounding and bending of the energy curves due to the anisotropy has been experimentally observed@xcite in two - electron quantum dots .    in the case of strong anisotropy ( fig .",
    "[ ensp0.5 ] ) , the spectra have evolved to such an extent that only little relation to the circular case can be traced , and as a result we use a single label signifying the total spin to distinguish them .",
    "an important feature that emerges is that the three curves with lowest energies ( two @xmath90 and one @xmath97 curve ) form a band that is well separated from the other excited states .",
    "the existence of such an isolated lowest - energy band is important for validating simple two - qubit and three - qubit models introduced in quantum computation and quantum information theory.@xcite    another remarkable feature of the strong - anisotropy case is the appearance of a non - trivial triple - point crossing lying on the ground - state curve ( see arrow in fig .  [ ensp0.5 ] ) , which is created from the collapse of the abc triangle between the two @xmath90 and the one @xmath97 lowest - in - energy curves ( compare figs .  [ enspcir ] and [ ensp0.7 ] ) .",
    "this low - energy non - trivial triple point [ forming within the lowest landau band ( @xmath114 ) ] is due to the effect of the coulomb interaction , and it is to be contrasted to other trivial triple - point crossings at much higher energies arising from the intersection of the lowest landau band with the @xmath115 and @xmath116 higher landau bands , and which are present even in the non - interacting limit [ see , e.g. , the triple crossing at ( 2.0 t ; 14.2 mev ) in fig .  [ enspnint ] ] .",
    "it would be of interest to analyze whether the recently observed@xcite triple - point crossings in deformed quantum dots are non - trivial or trivial in the sense described above .    before leaving this section",
    ", we note that the spin multiplets @xmath60 and @xmath61 are degenerate in energy when @xmath56 , which was the case for the energy spectra presented in figs . 1 - 5 .",
    "at a given magnetic field , this degeneracy is naturally lifted when @xmath117 ; however , the final total energies can be easily calculated by adding the zeeman term @xmath118 to the spectral curves displayed in these figures .",
    "furthermore , for a given pair @xmath119 , the zeeman term does not influence the intrinsic structure of the many - body exd wave function [ i.e. , the expansion over constituent slater determinants , see eq .",
