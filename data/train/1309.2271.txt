    "mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) are a key concept in quantum science since they are intimately related to the nature of quantum information .",

    "the amount of information that can be extracted from a physical system is fundamentally limited . in this context",
    ", mubs acquire a fundamental relevance since they serve as a powerful toolbox to explore generally bohr s complementarity .",
    "also in mathematical science mubs are investigated since the problem of finding a complete set of mubs for a given dimension is only solved for prime and power prime dimensions : the so called maximal set problem .",
    "key evidence of entanglement are correlations that are stronger than those possible in classical systems . in 1998",
    "the horodecki family predicted a new type of entanglement : bound entanglement  @xcite .",
    "these heavily mixed entangled states , from which no pure entanglement can be distilled applying local operations and allowing for classical communication , are puzzling since its role in nature is not understood .",
    "moreover , it is computationally hard to detect bound entanglement .    in this contribution",
    "we show a relation between these two basic concepts of quantum theory , in particular we show that bound entanglement can be detected in an experimentally feasible way via correlations obtained from a complete set of mubs in prime and prime power dimensions .",

    "we immediately obtain that if a state is @xmath9-separable , it is automatically also @xmath14-separable for all @xmath15 . in particular , an @xmath1-partite state is called fully separable , if it is @xmath1-separable , whereas it is called genuinely @xmath1-partite entangled , if and only if it is not biseparable ( @xmath16-separable ) . if neither of these is the case , the state is called partially entangled or partially separable .    while the above intuitive definition has been shown to provide a proper characterization of multipartite systems ,",
    "it is far from straightforward to find out for a given state whether it is @xmath9-separable or not .",
    "one immediately recognizes this since a @xmath9-separable mixed state may be @xmath9-separable under different partitions . from a physical point of view",
    "the generation of fully separable or biseparable states does not require interaction of all parties .",
    "moreover , from the quantum information theoretic and operational perspective genuine multipartite entangled states allow for new applications such as quantum secret sharing ( i.e. by distributing a secret over many different parties the genuine multipartite entanglement assures security against eavesdropping  @xcite ) .    *",

    "@xcite ) @xmath23 one main property of this class of states is that tracing out one particle results in a maximally mixed state , i.e. all states are locally maximally mixed .    for @xmath1 pairs of qudit states we can define a similar simplex by @xmath24 also in this case , the @xmath25 bell - type vertex states @xmath26",

    "the vertex states are the famous smolin states  @xcite ( certain mixtures of ghz states ) which are shown to be multipartite bound entangled .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proven that for any @xmath1 the geometrical properties concerning separability and mixedness are the same .",
    "in particular the authors showed that any entanglement witness for @xmath29 can be reduced to the one obtained for a single pair ( i.e. in @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , all geometrical properties concerning full separability or positivity under partial transposition ( ppt ) can be derived considering the much easier case of a single pair ( bipartite qudits ) . the geometry of entanglement visualized in fig .",

    "the first thing to note is that we found that ppt - bound entangled states of the above defined class could only be detected by @xmath45 if one considers a complete set of mubs , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "we proved this for all prime and prime power dimensions up to @xmath47 . in dimension @xmath48",
    "only three mubs are known , using them we do not detect any bound entanglement .",

    "the positivity condition leads to a ( green ) triangle while the horodecki - peres criterion ( ppt ) leads to a curved ( blue ) region .",
    "hence , where both regions overlap each point corresponds to a state which is positive under partial transposition .",
    "all points at the right hand side of the red line are detected by the mub criterion @xmath41 to be entangled , i.e. are greater than @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , where all three regions overlap the states are bound entangled .",
    "note that the graphics could be also interpreted differently : starting from states that are defined by the curved ( blue ) area the positivity criterion under partial transposition corresponds to states represented by the ( green ) triangle .",
    "for @xmath28 no bound entanglement is detected in agreement with the fact that for bipartite systems bound entanglement only exists for @xmath57 .",
    "for the other dimensions we observe that the geometry of the class of states that we consider is similar , and that a large region of states are detected to be bound entangled by the mub criterion .",
    "let us now discuss the multipartite case for @xmath28 .",
    "this simplex was first considered in ref .",
    "it was found that all states are @xmath58-partite entangled , in particular they are not bipartite entangled .",
    "moreover , the vertex states , the smolin states ( certain mixtures of ghz - states ) , can not be distilled by local parties ; they are bound entangled .",
    "note that this multipartite bound entanglement is considerably different from bipartite bound entanglement , since  if two local parties join  pure maximal entanglement can be distilled by local operations and classical communications , i.e. the multipartite entanglement is unlockable .",
    "interestingly , the entangled states inside the simplex can be distilled to the vertex states . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath58-partite states with @xmath59 degrees of freedom were considered and for a subset of states inside the simplex , a distillation protocol was found that transforms these states to the vertex states , which are unlockable bound entangled .    in summary",
    ", this means that while the basic geometric structure of separable and ( ppt  bound ) entangled states in the simplex remains unchanged with @xmath1 ( the pictures depict in fig .",
    "[ figbound ] correspond to @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] , respectively ) , the properties of the states change drastically . for @xmath29 the states of the simplex",
    "are unlockable bound entangled since the ( mixed ) vertex states can not be distilled , but if at least two local parties join the entanglement can be unlocked .",
    "in addition entangled states that are not @xmath60 inside the simplex may be distillable to any vertex state , whereas ppt  bound entangled states can not be distilled at all .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have reported on an experiment with two photons , each one entangled in three different orbital angular momentum states .",
    "the correlations required for the mub criterion @xmath41 were measured for @xmath61 $ ] choosing proper parameters ( fig.[figbound](b ) ) . a result above @xmath16 was recorded and thus proving the generation of entanglement .",
    "the positivity under partial transposition was proven via state tomography .",
    "thus bipartite bound entanglement for qutrits was witnessed for the first time .",
    "recent experiments in photonic multipartite systems  @xcite report the detection of a unlockable bound vertex states of four photons with @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was reported that the jaynes - cummings model also exhibits bound entangled states .",
    "last but not least let us mention that not all bound entangled states in the magic simplex are detected by mub criterion , e.g. those considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "this is also obvious since @xmath40 is a linear entanglement witness .",
    "we showed that the criterion based on mutually unbiased bases  exploring bohr s complementarity  is a simple and experimentally feasible tool to detect ppt - bound entanglement in bipartite and multipartite states .",
    "in particular , the real dimensional `` magic '' simplex , a certain class of states , turned out to be helpful in comparing distinct dimensions and number of particles via the geometry . we find similar geometrical structures concerning the properties entanglement .",
    "since experimenters control more and more degrees of freedoms and number of particles our mub criterion serves as a toolbox to reveal different entanglement features and may also contribute in solving the problem of the number of a complete set of mubs .",
