    "the differential - phase - shift quantum key distribution ( dpsqkd ) protocol@xcite is a promising protocol for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) featuring the tolerance against photon number splitting attacks .",
    "however , its security has only been investigated so far against limited types of attacks ; the most effective attack up to present had been a particular type of individual attacks investigated by waks et al .",
    "@xcite , in which eve acts on _ photons _ individually rather than on _ signals_. several long - distance experiments claiming security along its line have been reported ( see , e.g.,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another important class of attacks is a variant of intercept - resend attacks called _ sequential attacks _ which was also discussed originally by waks et al.@xcite and later improved by curty et al.@xcite .",
    "however , they still remain less effective than the individual type for most probable applications",
    ".    we will here present a further improvement on the sequential attack in which the attacker eve modulates not only the phases but also the amplitude in the superposition of the single - photon states which she sends to the receiver . in this paper , with a slight abuse of terminology , we call such differentiations in the amplitude an _ intensity modulation _ and investigate its consequence . concentrating especially on the  discretized gaussian \" intensity modulation , we show that our attack is more effective than the individual attack , which had been the best attack . as a result of this ,",
    "the recent experiment with communication distance of 100 km reported by diamanti et al.@xcite turns out to be insecure .",
    "moreover it can be shown that in a practical experimental setup which is commonly used today , the communication distance achievable by the dpsqkd protocol is less than 95 km .    in what follows",
    ", we shall consider a conservative definition of security , i.e. , we assume that eve can control some flaws in alice s and bob s devices ( e.g. , the detection efficiency and the dark count probability of the detectors ) , together with the losses in the channel , and she exploits them to obtain maximal information about the shared key .",
    "the dpsqkd protocol proceeds as follows@xcite .    1 .   alice generates a random bit string @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 and sends to bob the coherent light pulses with phase @xmath3 and intensity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "that is , alice generates the following @xmath7 and sends to bob : @xmath8 intensity @xmath4 is related to the average photon number @xmath9 per pulse as @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   using a mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig.[fig : dpsqkd_scheme ] ) , bob measures the phase difference @xmath11 of each adjacent pair of pulses , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are always in modulo 2 . ] .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is recorded as the sifted key @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18 are the times when photons are detected .",
    "3 .   communicating on an authenticated classical channel , alice and bob perform key reconciliation and the generalized privacy amplification@xcite to calculate the secret key .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the transmission of the communication channel including the loss in fiber and bob s interferometer , and the quantum efficiency of bob s detector .",
    "we also denote by @xmath20 the dark count of bob s detector .",
    "then the signal and detection rate @xmath21 at bob s side is given by @xmath22 thus in the second step above , the average length @xmath23 of the sifted key is @xmath24 .",
    "in this section , we first define our attack and then calculate several probabilities that are necessary for later analyses , i.e. , the error rate which bob detects as a result of the attack and the success probability of eve s attack .",
    "the necessary conditions for eve to carry out the attack are also derived in terms of experimental parameters , such as the average photon number @xmath9 and the transmission @xmath19 .",
    "the basic scheme of our sequential attack is the same as the previous versions given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the state @xmath25 which eve sends is a superposition of single - photon states with different amplitudes ( see fig.[fig : attack ] ) .",
    "the precise definition of our attack is as follows :    1 .",
    "using unambiguous state discrimination ( usd , see ref.@xcite ) measurement , eve measures the phase @xmath26 of all but small portion of the pulses that alice sent and records the outcome .",
    "+ here the small portion means a pulse sequence of length @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a parameter to be specified later .",
    "2 .   for @xmath31 sequential detection events of length @xmath32 or larger , eve does as follows : + if the detected phases were , say , @xmath33 , she generates state @xmath34 defined as @xmath35 and sends it to bob . here",
    "parameter @xmath36 is a sufficiently larege number , and @xmath37 are set as @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and other @xmath40 s are randomly chosen values .",
    "the creation operator @xmath41 denotes a single photon pulse incident to bob for time interval @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   eve sends @xmath27 pulses which she kept intact in the first step , and sends them to alice .    in what follows",
    ", we assume that transmission @xmath19 and @xmath43 are small enough ( e.g. , with the communication distance being sufficiently large ) so that @xmath44 can be neglected .",
    "the usd measurement performed in the first step succeeds for each pulse with probability @xmath45 where @xmath10 is the average number of photon per pulse@xcite .",
    "it can easily be shown that when eve repeats it for a sufficiently long sequence of pulses , a sequential detection with length @xmath32 or larger occurs with probability @xmath46 in other words , as a result of usd measurements on @xmath47 pulses , eve finds on average @xmath48 events of sequential detections of at least length @xmath32 .",
    "hence @xmath49 is necessary in order for eve to carry out her attack .",
    "every state @xmath34 sent by eve in the second step will always yield one detection event in bob s detector in either of time @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , bob s overall detection probability of @xmath34 is strictly one .",
    "however , the detection can generally occur in a wrong detector causing the bit flip in the sifted key , or it may click in time @xmath42 where eve does not know the corresponding phase shift , in which case she fails to steal the sifted key bit .    to evaluate these effects",
    "we will below obtain , in terms of the amplitude @xmath51 , the formulae for the error rate @xmath52 caused by each @xmath34 , and the probaility @xmath53 that eve ends up reading the sifted key bit using @xmath34 . in what follows",
    ", we suppose that @xmath47 is sufficiently large and @xmath51 converges to zero fast enough for @xmath54 , so that parameter @xmath55 introduced in the second step of our attack can be regarded as infinite .",
    "suppose that eve has succeeded in determining @xmath32 subsequent phases @xmath33 in the first step and knows the corresponding phase differences @xmath56 , @xmath17 , @xmath57 .",
    "then in the second step , state @xmath34 of eqn.([eq : defphi ] ) sent to bob evolves inside his interferometer as @xmath58d_{1i}^\\dagger|0\\rangle,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where creation operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the single photons incident to the detectors outputting @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "an error in @xmath12 occurs when the spectrum @xmath63 contained in eqn.([eq : interferometer ] ) is measured by bob .",
    "hence bob detects error with probability @xmath64 by summing this over for eve s random choices of @xmath37 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we have @xmath67.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , eve ends up knowing alice and bob s raw key bit when bob detects either one of phase differences @xmath56 , @xmath17,@xmath57 , which occurs with probability @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{eq : detection_rate}\\ ] ] note here that we are justified in including error events in @xmath53 because the corresponding sifted key bit will always match between eve and bob due to key reconciliations to be performed later , as long as the detected error rate is smaller than the threshold qber .",
    "hence in order for eve to carry out the attack it is sufficient that there exist parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the qber in the absence of bob .",
    "inequality ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) means that eve has an enough number of sequential events , and inequality ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) is to guarantee that the error rate is small enough so that the presence of eve will not be noticed by bob . and",
    "as a result of the attack , eve steals @xmath73 bits out of an sifted key of length @xmath74 bits on average while the error rate measured by bob is @xmath75 .    since key reconciliation and the generalized privacy amplification",
    "are used in the secret key generation of the dpsqkd @xcite , the key generation rate @xmath76 is bounded from above as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the mutual informations between alice and bob , and between alice and eve , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath78 equals @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the binary entropy function @xmath82 , and @xmath79 is given by @xmath83 in our sequential attack .",
    "thus if eve is not interested in obtaining as many sifted key bits as possible , but rather she is only willing to invalidate the key distribution between alice and bob , the best strategy for her is to minimize the error rate @xmath75 by suppressing the ratio @xmath84 .",
    "that is , when inequalities ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) and ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) are satisfied for @xmath85 and a certain value of @xmath32 , the error rate @xmath75 measured by bob can be further reduced by taking @xmath84 such that @xmath86 in what follows , we will call such minimum value of @xmath75 the effective error rate and denote it by @xmath87 .",
    "in the original form of sequential attacks as introduced by waks et al.@xcite , the amplitude @xmath51s were @xmath88 for which the error and detection rates were @xmath89 in this section we demonstrate how these can be improved by selecting an appropriate wave form for @xmath51 .",
    "one can generally seek for the best attack strategy , i.e. , the best pattern of @xmath51 with the smallest @xmath52 possible for each value of @xmath32 while maintaining the enough ratio @xmath53 of bits accessible to eve , as long as @xmath32s are sufficiently small .",
    "indeed it is not difficult at all to find out the best @xmath51 , e.g. , by doing numerical simulations , but in this paper , as the first trial , we will concentrate on the following ( discretized ) gaussian pattern : @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{eq : def_gaussian}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath91 appearing on the right hand side normalizes @xmath34 as @xmath92 , @xmath93 denotes the time offset , and @xmath94 is the standard deviation to be adjusted later . for the present we will set @xmath93 at the center of eve s detected signals , i.e. ,",
    "when eve has detected phases @xmath95 , we set @xmath96 .      in order to have a rough idea as to how effective the gaussian intensity modulation in eqn.([eq : def_gaussian ] ) is , we first investigate it in the continuous limit of @xmath97 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 given in eqn.([eq : error_rate ] ) and ( [ eq : detection_rate ] ) can be explicitly calculated . in this limit @xmath98 and we have @xmath99 with @xmath100 being the error function @xmath101 thus by choosing @xmath102 for example , we have @xmath103 , which is far smaller than eqn.([eq : prob_conventional ] ) .",
    "similarly , the detection rate can be calculated as @xmath104      in reality , we must take into account the corrections due to dicretization .",
    "adjusting values of @xmath94 , we numerically calculated for each value of @xmath32 the smallest of error rate @xmath52 as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "these values agree with the above first - order approximation within 10% for @xmath105 .",
    ".the smallest error rate @xmath52 caused by @xmath34 with the gaussian intensity modulation given in eqn.([eq : def_gaussian ] ) .",
    "these minimums are obtained by adjusting the standard deviation @xmath94 for each value of @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath32 denotes the length of eve s sequential detection , @xmath53 the corresponding detection rate , and @xmath87 the effective error rate measured by bob . [",

    "in this paper , we presented an improved version of sequential attacks with intensity modulation , which works more effectively than the individual attack . using this attack ,",
    "we have shown that the recent experiment with communication distance of 100 km reported by diamanti et al.@xcite is in fact insecure .",
    "we also showed that in a practical experimental setup which is commonly used today , the communication distance achievable by the dpsqkd protocol is less than 95 km .",
    "there are several straightforward ways to improve our result .",
    "first , although we restricted ourselves in this paper to the discretized gaussian distribution of eqn.([eq : def_gaussian ] ) , numerically optimizing @xmath51 can yield a better form of state @xmath34 with smaller error rate @xmath52 while maintaining detection rate @xmath53 , as mentioned at the beginning of sec.[sec : gaussian ] .",
    "moreover , by letting @xmath34 be a superposition of states with different photon numbers , we can increase the detection counts caused by each @xmath34 to more than one .",
