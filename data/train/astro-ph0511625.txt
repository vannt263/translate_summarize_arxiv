    "in 1998 the analysis of the redshift - distance relation of type ia supernova ( snia ) has established that our universe is currently accelerating  @xcite .",
    "recent observations of snia have confirmed the accelerated expansion at high confidence level@xcite .",
    "the nature of dark energy(de ) , the mysterious power to drive the expansion , is among the biggest problems in modern physics and has been studied widely .",
    "a cosmological constant , the simplest candidate of de where the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath2 remains -1 , suffers from the well - known fine - tuning and coincidence problems@xcite . alternatively , dynamical dark energy models with the rolling scalar fields have been proposed , such as quintessence@xcite , the ghost field of phantom@xcite and the model of k - essence which has non - canonical kinetic term@xcite .    given that currently we know very little on the theoretical aspects of dark energy , the cosmological observations play a crucial role in our understanding of dark energy .",
    "the model of phantom has been proposed in history due to the mild preference for a constant eos smaller than @xmath3 by the observations@xcite .",
    "although in this scenario dark energy violates the weak energy condition(wec ) and leads to the problem of quantum instabilities@xcite , it remains possible in the description of the nature of dark energy@xcite .",
    "an intriguing aspect in the study of dark energy is that the recent snia observations from the hst / goods program@xcite , combined together with the previous supernova data , somewhat favor the dynamical dark energy model with an equation of state getting across -1 during the evolution of the universe@xcite .",
    "although the conventional scalar dark energy models also show dynamical behaviors with redshift , due to the instabilities of perturbations they can not preserve the required behavior of crossing the cosmological constant boundary@xcite .",
    "the required model of dark energy has been called as quintom@xcite in the sense that its behavior resemble the combined behavior of quintessence and phantom",
    ". however , the quintom models can be very different from the quintessence or phantom in the determination of the evolution and fate of the universe@xcite .",
    "there are a lot of interests in the literature recently in the building of quintom - like models . with minimally coupled to gravity",
    "a simple realization of quintom scenario is a model with the double fields of quintessence and phantom@xcite . in such cases quintom",
    "would typically encounter the problem of quantum instability inherited in the phantom component .",
    "however in the case of the single field scalar model of quintom , ref.@xcite added a high derivative term to the kinetic energy and its energy - momentum tensor is equivalent to the two - field quintom model .",
    "such a model with a high derivative term is possibly without quantum instabilities and as indicated by the snia observations , we are living with the ghosts @xcite .",
    "perturbations of the quintom - like models have been studied extensively in ref.@xcite .",
    "observing the dark energy dynamics is currently the most important aspect of the dark energy study . besides the snia data , a thorough investigation demands a fully consistent analysis of cosmic microwave background(cmb ) , large scale structure(lss ) and with multi - parameter freedoms .",
    "the aim of current paper is to study the observational implications on dark energy in the consistent way .",
    "we extend our previous work of ref.@xcite and study the full observational constraints on dynamical dark energy .",
    "in particular we pay great attention to the effects of dark energy perturbations when the equation of state gets across -1 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section ii we describe the method and the data ; in section iii we present our results on the determination of cosmological parameters with the first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , snia @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data by global fittings using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques   @xcite ; finally we present our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in this section we firstly present the general formula of the dark energy perturbations in the full parameter space of @xmath2 especially when it crosses over the cosmological constant boundary . in our mcmc fittings",
    "to wmap , snia and sdss , we adopt a specific parametrization of the equation of state .    despite our ignorance of the nature of dark energy ,",
    "it is natural to consider the de fluctuation whether de is regarded as scalar field or fluid . in the extant cases like the two - field - quintom model as well as the single field case with a high derivative term  @xcite",
    ", the perturbation of de is shown to be continuous when the eos gets across -1 .",
    "for the conventional parameterized equation of state one can easily reconstruct the potential of the scalar dark energy if the eos does not get across -1 . resembling the multi - field model of quintom or quintom with high derivative terms , the potential of the quintom dark energy can be directly reconstructed from the parameterized eos on either side of the cosmological constant boundary . in this paper",
    "we give a self - consistent method to handle the perturbation in all the allowed range of eos especially for the region where eos evolves close to and crosses -1 .",
    "for the parametrization of the eos which gets across -1 , firstly we introduce a small positive constant @xmath4 to divide the full range of the allowed value of the eos @xmath2 into three parts : 1 ) @xmath5 ; 2 ) @xmath6 ; and 3 ) @xmath7 . working in the conformal newtonian gauge , one can describe the perturbations of dark energy as follows @xcite : & = & -(1+w)(-3 ) -3(c_s^2-w )  , [ dotdelta ] + & = & -(1 - 3w)- + k^2(+ )   .",
    "[ dottheta ]    neglecting the entropy perturbation contributions , for the regions 1 ) and 3 ) the eos is always greater than @xmath3 and less than @xmath3 respectively and perturbation is well defined by solving eqs.([dotdelta],[dottheta ] ) . for the case 2 ) , the perturbation of energy density @xmath8 and divergence of velocity , @xmath9 , and the derivatives of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are finite and continuous for the realistic quintom dark energy models .",
    "however for the perturbations of the parametrizations there is clearly a divergence . in our study for such a regime",
    ", we match the perturbation in region 2 ) to the regions 1 ) and 3 ) at the boundary and set@xcite @xmath10 in our numerical calculations we ve limited the range to be @xmath11 and we find our method is a very good approximation to the multi - field quintom , with the accuracy being greater than @xmath12 .    in the study of this paper the parameterized eos of dark energy is taken by@xcite @xmath13 the method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc`@xcite , which has been modified to allow for the inclusion of dark energy perturbations with eos getting across -1@xcite .",
    "we sample the following 8 dimensional set of cosmological parameters : @xmath14)\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to critical density , @xmath17 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon and angular diameter distance , @xmath18 is the optical depth , @xmath19 is defined as the amplitude of initial power spectrum and @xmath20 measures the spectral index . basing on the bayesian analysis ,",
    "we vary the above 8 parameters fitting to the observational data with the mcmc method . throughout",
    ", we assume a flat universe and take the weak priors as : @xmath21 , a cosmic age tophat prior as 10 gyr@xmath2220 gyr . furthermore",
    ", we make use of the hst measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath23 @xcite by multiplying the likelihood by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath24 and with a standard deviation @xmath25 . we impose a weak gaussian prior on the baryon and density @xmath26 ( 1 @xmath27 ) from big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite .    in our calculations we have taken the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods of cmb , snia and lss . alternatively defining @xmath28",
    ", we get ^2_total = ^2_cmb+ ^2_snia+^2_lss   .in the computation of cmb we have included the first - year temperature and polarization data @xcite with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team @xcite . in the computation of nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectra we have used the code of halofit @xcite and fitted to the 3d power spectrum of galaxies from the sdss@xcite using the code developed in ref . @xcite . in the calculation of the likelihood from snia we have marginalized over the nuisance parameter . for the main results of the current paper the supernova data we use are the `` gold '' set of 157 snia published by riess @xmath29 @xmath30 in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also consider the constraints from the distance measurements of the 71 high redshift type ia supernova discovered during the first year of the 5-year supernova legacy survey ( snls)@xcite .",
    "in this section we present our results , particularly focusing on the effects of the dark energy perturbation .",
    "we start with the descriptions on the background parameters , then present the constraints on dark energy parameters . at last",
    "we give our constraints on dark energy from the recent observational data of snls .",
    "mean @xmath31 constrains on cosmological parameters using different combination of wmap , snia and sdss information with / without de perturbation .",
    "for the weakly constrained parameters we quote the @xmath32 upper limit instead .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table 1",
    "we list the mean 1@xmath27 constraints on the parameters with and without de perturbations .",
    "we find that almost all the cosmological parameters are well determined in our both cases .",
    "however the reionization depth seems to be an exception where a vanishing @xmath18 can not be ruled out .",
    "we notice the determination on @xmath18 is prior dependent .",
    "for example the wmap collaboration have taken a prior like @xmath33@xcite , which leads to a relatively stringent constraint on @xmath18 by the observations and a nonzero @xmath18 is particularly favored by the high power of temperature - polarization cross correlation on the largest scales@xcite .",
    "however when the strong prior on @xmath18 is dropped one will in general get a less stringent bound from the full observational constraints , as also shown in ref .",
    "the prior on @xmath18 is somewhat crucial for our parameter estimation since its effects on cmb can be compensated with the tilt of the primordial scalar as well as the tensor spectrum . as we will show below it will also be correlated with the dark energy parameters due to the integrated sachs - wolfe(isw ) effects .    in fig.[1d ]",
    "also we delineate the corresponding posterior one dimensional marginalized distributions of the cosmological parameters from the combined observations of wmap , sdss and snia .",
    "the dotted vertical lines shows the quantity of every parameter with ( red ) and without ( blue ) de perturbation giving the maximum likelihood . due to the fact that the peaks in the likelihood are different from the corresponding expectation values ,",
    "the dashed lines in fig.[1d ] do not lie at the center of the projected likelihoods .",
    "a vanishing @xmath18 can not be excluded by the full combined observations at high confidence level . for the order of parameters listed in ( 5 ) the best fit values constrained by the full dataset ( wmap + snia + sdss ) is * * p**=(0.023,0.12,1.04,0.16,-1.30,1.25,0.995,3.23 ) . and",
    "for comparison the resulting parameters when switching off dark energy perturbations are given by * * p**=(0.023,0.12,1.05,0.14,-1.15,0.63,0.962,3.14 ) .",
    "comparing with the bottom of table 1 , although the minimum @xmath34 values have not been affected significantly ( up to 1 ) by dark energy perturbations , all the best fit parameters have been changed . moreover",
    ", the allowed parameter space has been changed a lot and the constraints on the background parameters have been less stringent when including the dark energy perturbations .",
    "this can also be clearly seen from the two dimensional contour plots on the background parameters in fig.[2d ] .",
    "the reason is not difficult to explain .",
    "the isw effects of the dynamical dark energy boosts the large scale power spectrum of cmb@xcite . for a constant equation of state ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that when the perturbations of dark energy have been neglected incorrectly , a suppressed isw will be resulted for quintessence - like dark energy and on the contrary , an enhanced isw is led to by phantom - like dark energy . in this sense if we neglect dark energy contributions , there will be less degeneracy in the determination of dark energy as well as the relative cosmological parameters . however",
    ", dark energy perturbations are anti - correlated with the source of matter perturbations and this will lead to a compensation on the isw effects , which result in a large parameter degeneracy@xcite .",
    "in fact as we have shown that crossing over the cosmological constant boundary would not lead to distinctive effects@xcite , hence the effects of our smooth parametrization of eos on cmb can also be somewhat identified with a constant effective equation of state@xcite @xmath35 however the snia and lss observations will break such a degeneracy .",
    "thus for the realistic cases of including dark energy perturbations , the correlations between the dark energy and the background parameters as well as the auto correlations of the background cosmological parameters have been enlarged , as can be seen from fig.[2d ] .    the contribution of dark energy perturbation affect significantly the distribution of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which can also be seen from fig.[compare ] on the constrains in the @xmath38 plane .",
    "for the parameters @xmath39 the inclusion of the dark energy perturbation change its best fit values from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . in fig.[compare ] , from outside in , the contours shrink with adding 157 snia data provided by riess @xmath29 @xmath30 and sdss information .",
    "dark energy perturbation introduces more degeneracy between @xmath42 and @xmath43 thus enlarges the contours significantly . for the discussion on dynamical dark energy",
    "we have separated the space of @xmath44 into four areas by the lines of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the areas will then represent the quintessence where the eos is always no less than -1 ( the area with @xmath47 can be reached by quintessence with a negative potential@xcite ) , quintom a where @xmath2 is phantom - like today but quintessence - like in the past , phantom where the eos is always no larger than -1 and quintom b where dark energy has @xmath48 today but @xmath49 at higher redshifts . from the figure we can see that dynamical dark energy with the four types",
    "are all allowed by the current observations and quintom a seems to cover the largest area in the 2-dimensional contours with all the data we used .    as shown in fig.[compare ] that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are in strong correlations .",
    "the constraints on @xmath50 are perhaps relatively model independent , as suggested by ref.@xcite .",
    "following@xcite we obtain the constraints on @xmath50 by computing the median and 1 , 2@xmath27 intervals at any redshift . in fig.[w ] we plot the behavior of the dark energy eos as a function of redshift @xmath51 , we find that at redshift @xmath52 the constraint on the eos is relatively the most stringent .",
    "one can see that the perturbation reinforces the trend of de to cross -1 at @xmath53 .",
    "however due to the limitation of the observational data , the quintom scenario is only favored at @xmath54 by the full dataset of wmap , sdss and snia .",
    "we find the value at @xmath52 is restricted at w(z=0.3)=-1.002^+0.044 + 0.180_-0.079 - 0.159 for the case without dark energy perturbations and w(z=0.3)=-1.029 ^+0.108 + 0.230_-0.098 - 0.288 when including dark energy perturbations . correspondingly at redshift",
    "@xmath55 the constraints turn out to be w(z=1)=-0.890^+0.180 + 0.193_-0.159 - 0.301 without perturbations and w(z=1)=-0.868^+0.215 + 0.520_-0.204 - 0.815 when including dark energy perturbations .",
    "one should bear in mind that such a constraint is not really model independent , as shown in refs .",
