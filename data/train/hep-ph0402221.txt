    "single - spin triple product asymmetries , or asymmetries arising from transverse polarization , play a special role in scattering theory because they are directly sensitive to rescattering phases .",
    "an operator of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a spin and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two different particle momenta , is odd under a `` naive '' time - reversal operation which reverses all spins and momenta , but does not exchange initial and final states .",
    "a nonzero value for @xmath5 stems from terms in the covariant scattering amplitude that are proportional to the levi - civita tensor @xmath6 , which always appears accompanied by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , in the absence of cp violation , a nonzero expectation value @xmath8 requires an absorptive ( imaginary ) part for the amplitude , @xmath9 , which can be generated by rescattering , for example by one - loop diagrams containing intermediate two - particle cuts .",
    "there have been many theoretical and experimental studies of single - spin transversely - polarized asymmetries in a variety of contexts .",
    "for instance , in the decay of a polarized neutron , @xmath10 , an expectation value for @xmath11 is produced by qed final - state interactions , which can therefore mask truly @xmath12-odd effects  @xcite .",
    "analogous single - spin observables in the decay of a polarized @xmath13 boson to three hadronic jets , stemming from qcd and electroweak final - state interactions , have been studied theoretically  @xcite and bounded experimentally  @xcite .",
    "qcd final - state interactions can also play a role in generating azimuthal single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive pion leptoproduction off polarized protons at leading twist  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a phase in the time - like electromagnetic proton form - factor from qcd final - state interactions can be detected by measuring transverse proton polarization in the reaction @xmath14",
    "@xcite .    as a final example",
    ", qed rescattering phases produce an azimuthal asymmetry in the elastic scattering of electrons off transversely polarized protons , @xmath15 , or transverse final - state polarization in the time - reversed reaction @xmath16 .",
    "the qed asymmetry receives contributions not only from two - photon exchange with a single proton in the intermediate state , but also from inelastic hadronic intermediate states ; the latter terms are difficult to compute directly , although they can be bounded experimentally  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the cleanest setting for studying such asymmetries is in a process dominated by qed , such as transversely polarized mller scattering , @xmath0 .",
    "experiment e158 at slac performs mller scattering of @xmath17 gev polarized electrons off unpolarized target electrons at rest .",
    "the prime goal of e158 is to measure the parity - violating right - left asymmetry in the cross section for longitudinal beam polarization , @xmath18 .",
    "the right - left asymmetry is sensitive to @xmath13 boson exchange , and potentially to new physics , such as a new @xmath13 boson or contact interactions .",
    "the first measurement has yielded @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "while most of the e158 data were taken with the electron beam polarized longitudinally in order to accomplish this measurement , a fraction of the running was carried out with transverse electron polarization , enabling the measurement of an azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin of the incoming electron , with momentum @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the azimuthal angle of the scattered electron ( with momentum @xmath24 ) around the beam direction , measured from the direction of the transverse polarization .",
    "in contrast to @xmath25 , a nonzero azimuthal asymmetry @xmath26 can be generated by qed interactions alone .",
    "the calculation of @xmath26 for transversely polarized mller scattering at the leading one - loop order was performed by barut and fronsdal in 1960  @xcite , and by deraad and ng in 1974  @xcite . because only the absorptive part of the scattering amplitude contributes to this observable , an @xmath27-channel cut is required .",
    "hence only the box feynman diagram enters , plus the version obtained by exchanging the two identical outgoing electron legs , as depicted in  . besides the rescattering phase , the effect requires an electron helicity flip . for center - of - mass ( cm ) energies much larger than the electron mass , @xmath28 , therefore , it takes the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fine structure constant , @xmath23 and @xmath31 are respectively the azimuthal and ( cm frame ) polar scattering angles , and @xmath32 is a function of @xmath31 .",
    "since there are two identical electrons in the final state , @xmath33 must be odd under @xmath34 ; that is , a symmetric acceptance in @xmath31 ( in an unsegmented detector ) will wash out the asymmetry in @xmath23 .",
    "the e158 detector is well segmented in @xmath23 ( twelve - fold ) , but coarsely segmented in @xmath31 ( only two - fold ) .",
    "fortuitously , the @xmath31 acceptance is almost entirely in the backward hemisphere in the cm frame , leaving the sensitivity of e158 to @xmath26 quite high .",
    "the e158 cm energy is roughly 200  mev , so the asymmetry is of order @xmath35 .",
    "this may seem small , but it is two orders of magnitude larger than the electroweak asymmetry @xmath25 . even though only a relatively small fraction of the data was taken with transversely polarized electrons , a precision of the order of a few percent can be achieved for @xmath26 .",
    "one can either test qed at this level , or reverse the logic and use the qed prediction as a detector calibration or polarimeter  @xcite .    at the percent level of precision",
    ", it becomes important to investigate the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , or @xmath36 , qed radiative corrections to @xmath26 .",
    "the full @xmath36 calculation of the asymmetry requires two - loop scattering amplitudes for @xmath37 and one - loop scattering amplitudes for @xmath38 . for @xmath28 , as in e158 kinematics , it would suffice to compute these amplitudes in the limit where one takes @xmath39 after extracting the leading @xmath40 behavior from the diagrams .",
    "this computation should be feasible , because it is known how to perform all the relevant two - loop four - point integrals  @xcite and one - loop five - point integrals  @xcite in this limit in dimensional regularization .",
    "( similar amplitudes without transverse polarization have already been computed  @xcite . )    in the present paper , we calculate the largest of the @xmath36 corrections , those that are enhanced by the large logarithm @xmath41 due to collinear singularities in initial state radiation from both the incoming beam electron and the target electron , as well as final - state radiation . the amplitude for @xmath38 factorizes in these collinear limits , so that its full kinematic dependence is not required . in an electron structure function approach  @xcite , analogues of the dglap splitting kernels",
    "@xcite enter our computation . in the case of target radiation and final - state radiation ,",
    "only the unpolarized kernels are required .",
    "however , the radiation from the transversely polarized beam electron also involves the analogues of kernels for the evolution of transversely polarized quark distributions  @xcite .",
    "these kernels can be obtained from the standard longitudinally polarized splitting amplitudes by a change of basis .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the leading - log nlo corrections is quite sensitive to the experimental cuts .",
    "initial state radiation ( isr ) , for example , lowers the effective value of @xmath27 , which could enhance the asymmetry , since the leading - order asymmetry is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "more importantly , isr also skews the relation between polar angles in the post - radiation @xmath42 cm frame and the lab frame , changing the effective cm polar angle acceptance of the experiment .",
    "final state radiation ( fsr ) does not have either of these properties , and typically produces smaller corrections to the asymmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "establish our notation and review the leading - order azimuthal asymmetry prediction  @xcite . in we describe the leading - log nlo corrections and present numerical results for an experimental arrangement similar to e158 . in",
    "we present our conclusions . in appendix  [ appendixa ]",
    "we give a derivation of the kernel needed for evolution of the transversely polarized electron distribution .",
    "we consider the process @xmath43,\\ ] ] where the photon is only present at next - to - leading order .",
    "we use a right - handed @xmath44 coordinate system , writing momenta @xmath45 .",
    "we take the energy of the beam electron in the lab frame to be @xmath46 , and its momentum to be in the @xmath47 direction : @xmath48 .",
    "we let its polarization be in the negative @xmath49 direction   direction .",
    "our results now agree with those of refs .",
    "we thank yury kolomensky for pointing out this problem . ] . in the lab frame , the unpolarized target electron is at rest , @xmath50 .",
    "the momentum of the detected scattered electron is @xmath51 ; its azimuthal angle @xmath23 increases from @xmath52 in the positive @xmath49 direction , through @xmath53 in the positive @xmath54 direction .",
    "the born - level differential cross section for mller scattering , from the tree diagrams in a , is @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "( we include the statistical factor of 1/2 for identical electrons in @xmath59 , so such expressions should be integrated over two - body phase - space for non - identical particles . )",
    "the leading term in the cross section containing azimuthal dependence arises at order @xmath60 , from the interference between the tree diagrams in a and the box diagrams in b. the @xmath23-dependence at this order is given by  @xcite @xmath61 \\ , .",
    "\\label{sigphiexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have reproduced this result independently .    include the exact dependence on the electron mass .",
    "however , in computing the nlo leading logarithms in @xmath62 , we shall drop the terms suppressed by powers of @xmath63 in the leading - order asymmetry .",
    "the error induced by omitting these terms , for e158 kinematics , is much smaller than the size of the @xmath64 corrections .",
    "the born - level and leading @xmath23-dependent cross sections then become , @xmath65 @xmath66 \\ , , \\label{sigphi}\\ ] ] and the kinematics can be simplified to @xmath67 with @xmath31 the cm frame polar scattering angle .",

    "we set @xmath74 here .",
    "( e158 probes central scattering in the cm frame , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ranging between @xmath77 and @xmath27 , so the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath79 or @xmath80 is negligible , less than 0.1% . ) the asymmetry is of order parts per million at this energy .        note that @xmath70 is odd under @xmath81 , or equivalently , that is odd under @xmath82 .",
    "this asymmetry is a consequence of having two identical electrons in the final state . in the cm frame , if one electron is at an angle @xmath83 , the other ( at leading order ) is at @xmath84 . because @xmath85 is odd under @xmath86 , the coefficient @xmath70 must be odd under @xmath81 .",
    "the odd behavior means that the integrated asymmetry seen by an experiment integrating over a range in @xmath71 is quite sensitive to the precise acceptance .",
    "for example , a symmetric forward - backward acceptance in the cm frame leads to zero asymmetry at leading order .",
    "the e158 polar - angle acceptance  @xcite , @xmath87 , corresponds mainly to the backward cm hemisphere for leading - order kinematics , @xmath88 , as indicated by the dotted lines in .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the sensitivity to the acceptance could lead to relatively large qed corrections from hard photon radiation , which skews the kinematics of the @xmath89 subprocess . in the next section we investigate these corrections in more detail .",
    "the leading - logarithmic qed corrections to the azimuthal asymmetry arise from collinearly enhanced hard photon radiation .",
    "these contributions can be divided into beam ( @xmath90 ) , target ( @xmath91 ) , and final - state ( @xmath32 ) radiation , according to the electron line with which the photon is collinear , as shown in  . in each of these limits ,",
    "the @xmath92 cross section factorizes into a collinear splitting probability  @xcite , multiplied by the lower - order @xmath89 cross section evaluated for boosted kinematics . in the construction of the asymmetry , for the @xmath23-dependent numerator",
    "the boosted cross section is provided by @xmath93 in  ; for the denominator of the asymmetry it is @xmath94 in  .",
    "we still have to pay a factor of @xmath40 in @xmath93 ; hence we can neglect powers of @xmath40 in the splitting probabilities .",
    "although from the perspective of the lab frame one might not expect radiation off of the target to be important , in the center of mass frame such radiation is on an almost equal footing with radiation from the beam .",
    "one difference , though , is that we have to track the transverse polarization of the quasi - on - shell electron in the case of beam radiation , as indicated by the opposing transverse arrows in  .",
    "a dilution of the transverse polarization will accompany the photon radiation in this case .",
    "we let @xmath49 denote the longitudinal momentum fraction retained by an incoming or outgoing electron , after it has radiated a collinear photon .",
    "the @xmath95 limit represents emission of a soft photon . in the leading - log approximation",
    ", we neglect the transverse momentum of the photon in computing the boosted kinematics of the @xmath89 subprocess .",
    "the integral over this small transverse momentum produces an overall factor of @xmath41 .",
    "the unpolarized splitting probability for massless electrons is well known  @xcite @xmath96 with the standard `` plus '' prescription definition , @xmath97 for the case of radiation from the transversely polarized beam , we need to know the probability of a transverse spin flip .",
    "this probability is unsuppressed in the massless electron limit , because a transverse polarization state is a coherent superposition of two different longitudinal ( helicity ) states .",
    "thus a helicity flip is not required , only a different amplitude for the two different electron helicity configurations , for a given photon helicity . in appendix  [ appendixa ]",
    "we perform this computation .",
    "the result can also be extracted from the qcd evolution equations for transversely polarized quarks  @xcite , by converting color factors and coupling constants to the qed case : @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) is the splitting probability without ( with ) a transverse spin flip .",
    "these probabilities satisfy @xmath101 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath102 terms make a vanishing contribution to the azimuthal asymmetry , since they do not disrupt the leading - order kinematics , and the spin - flip probability vanishes in the soft limit @xmath103 .    in the case of isr , because the radiated photon carries momentum , the effective cm energy - squared for the mller scattering decreases from @xmath104 to @xmath105 . in the case of fsr , the radiation happens after the scattering , so @xmath106 . in radiative events",
    ", we use @xmath31 to denote the polar angle in the cm frame of the @xmath89 subprocess . to take into account experimental cuts ,",

    "the corrections from beam and target radiation have opposite sign , because such radiated photons skew in opposite directions the relation between the subprocess cm frame and the lab frame , as indicated by  . for beam radiation ,",
    "as @xmath49 decreases from 1 , a given angle in the subprocess cm frame boosts to a larger angle in the laboratory frame .",

    "<S> experiment e158 at slac can measure an azimuthal asymmetry in single - spin , transversely polarized mller scattering , @xmath0 , which arises from a qed rescattering phase . </S>",
    "<S> we recompute the leading - order ( one - loop ) asymmetry , confirming previous results , and calculate the leading logarithmic qed corrections due to initial - state radiation from the beam and target electrons , and due to final - state radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the size of these radiative corrections is quite sensitive to experimental details , such as the acceptance in energy and in polar angle of the scattered electron . for e158 , </S>",
    "<S> the corrections are modest , increasing the parts - per - million asymmetry by roughly 1% . </S>"
