    "since its detection in the ism by e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the ground - state rotational transition ( @xmath16=1 - 0 ) of the co molecule ( second most abundant in the ism ) has become the most widely used tracer of h@xmath2 , with an excitation temperature of @xmath17  k and a wavelength of @xmath18  mm readily observable from the ground .",
