    "quantum graphs , which model the systems of interest in quantum chemistry , solid state physics and transmission of waves , have also been studied under the rmt framework @xcite .",
    "recently , rmt has been shown to be useful also in understanding the statistical properties of empirical cross - correlation matrices appearing in the study of multivariate time series of followings : price fluctuations in stock market @xcite , eeg data of brain @xcite , variation of different atmospheric parameters @xcite , etc .    in our previous studies @xcite complex networks",
    "have been analyzed under rmt framework .",
    "these works consider nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) of eigenvalues spectra of adjacency and laplacian matrices of various extensively studied networks .",
    "the nnsd gives probability for finding neighboring eigenvalues with a given spacing , and it follows two universal properties depending upon underlying correlations among the eigenvalues . for the correlated eigenvalues , nnsd follows gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) statistics of rmt , whereas it follows poissonian statistics for the uncorrelated eigenvalues .",
    "one of the main advantages of rmt approach is that depending on the nature of eigenvalues correlations one can separate system dependent part from random universal part , which are intermingled due to the complexity of the system @xcite .",
    "rmt analysis for the various networks shows that the nnsd of complex networks also follow universal goe statistics of rmt @xcite .",
    "this finding suggests that different results of goe statistics , which have successfully been applied to understand the systems coming from various fields starting from nuclei to the stock - market , can be applied to study networks as well .",
    "our earlier works concentrate on the nnsd studies of networks .",
    "nnsd carries information for the correlation between two adjacent eigenvalues , but do not tell about the correlation between two far - off eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , even though nnsd follows goe statistics of rmt , other properties may show deviations , which suggests that one can not rely on nnsd results exclusively . to probe for long - range correlations as well",

    "it is found that the spectral rigidity of the complex networks follows rmt prediction , with scale depending upon the properties of the networks .",
    "present work also analyzes the _ next_-nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnnsd ) of the adjacency matrix of the networks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : following the above introduction , sec .",
    "[ network ] explains various aspects of complex networks studies .",
    "[ rmt ] describes some basics of rmt relevant to our studies .",
    "[ results ] illustrates the rmt analysis for various model networks , namely ; random , scale - free and small world .",
    "the nnsd is the most widely studied property in random matrix literature , therefore , this section includes nnsd results for the above mentioned model networks @xcite , and presents results for nnnsd and the @xmath0-statistic of these networks .",

    "[ summary ] discusses and summarizes results with some possible future directions .",
    "last 10 years have witnessed a rapid advancement in the studies of complex networks .",
    "the main concept of the network theory is to define complex systems in terms of networks of many interacting units .",
    "few examples of such systems are interacting molecules in living cell , nerve cells in brain , computers in internet communication , social networks of interacting people , airport networks with flight connections , etc @xcite . in the graph",
    "theoretical terminology , units are called nodes and interactions are called edges @xcite .",
    "various model networks have been introduced to study the behavior of complex systems having underlying network structures .",
    "these model networks are based on simple principles , still they capture essential features of the underlying systems .      in random graph model of erds and",
    "rnyi any two nodes are randomly connected with probability @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that interactions between nodes are random .",
    "recently , with the availability of large maps of real world networks , it has been observed that the random graph model is not appropriate for studying the behavior of real world networks .",
    "hence many new models have been introduced .",
    "watts and strogatz proposed a model , popularly known as ` small - world network ' , which has properties of small diameter and high clustering @xcite . moreover",
    ", this model network is very sparse : network with a very few number of edges , another property shown by many real - world networks .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned properties , barabsi and albert show that degree distributions of many real - world networks have power - law .",
    "this implies that some nodes are much more connected than the others @xcite .",
    "barabsi - albert s scale - free model and watts - strogatz s small - world model have contributed immensely in understanding evolution and behavior of the real systems having network structures .",
    "following these two new models came an outbreak in the field of networks .",
    "these studies show that real world networks have coexistence of _ randomness _ and _ regularity _ @xcite .",
    "apart from the above mentioned investigations which focus on direct measurements of the structural properties of networks , there have been lot of studies demonstrating that properties of networks or graphs could be well characterized by the spectrum of associated adjacency matrix @xmath3 @xcite . for an unweighted graph",
    ", it is defined in the following way : @xmath4 , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 nodes are connected and @xmath7 otherwise . for an undirected network ,",
    "this matrix is symmetric and consequently has real eigenvalues .",
    "eigenvalues give information about some basic topological properties of the underlying network @xcite .",
    "spectral properties of networks have also been used to understand some of the dynamical properties of interacting chaotic units on networks , for example largest eigenvalue of adjacency matrix determines transition to the synchronized state @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of a matrix having finite probability @xmath2 of nonzero gaussian distributed random elements per row , follows wigner semicircular law in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "for very small @xmath2 also , which corresponds to the sparse random matrix , one gets semicircular law with several peaks at different eigenvalues @xcite .    with the increasing availability of large maps of real - world networks , analyses of spectral densities of adjacency matrix of real - world networks and model networks having real - world properties",
    "have also begun @xcite .",
    "these analyses show that the matrix constructed by @xmath7 and @xmath9 elements corresponding to a unweighted random network , also follows wigner semicircular law @xcite with degeneracy at @xmath10 .",
    "small - world model networks show very complex spectral density with many sharp peaks @xcite , while the spectral density of scale - free model networks exhibits so called triangular distribution @xcite .",
    "spectral density and nnsd of the random matrices constructed by @xmath7 and @xmath9 elements have been studied extensively in the ref .",
    "these studies show that nnsd of the random matrices follow goe distribution of rmt .",
    "in the random matrix studies of eigenvalues spectra , one has to consider two kinds of properties : ( 1 ) global properties , like spectral density or distribution of eigenvalues @xmath11 , and ( 2 ) local properties , like eigenvalue fluctuations around @xmath11 . among these ,",
    "the eigenvalue fluctuations is the most popular one .",
    "this is generally obtained from the nnsd of the eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues of network are denoted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the size of the network and @xmath14 . in order to get universal properties of the eigenvalue fluctuations",
    ", one has to remove the spurious effects due to the variations of spectral density and to work at constant spectral density on the average .",
    "thereby , it is customary in rmt to unfold the eigenvalues by a transformation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the averaged integrated eigenvalue density @xcite . since analytical form for @xmath17",
    "is not known , we numerically unfold the spectrum by polynomial curve fitting . using the unfolded spectrum , we calculate the nearest - neighbor spacings as @xmath18 and due to the above unfolding , the average nearest - neighbor spacings @xmath19 becomes _ unity _ , being independent of the system .",
    "the nnsd @xmath20 is defined as the probability distribution of these @xmath21 s . in case of poisson statistics , @xmath22 whereas for goe @xmath23 for the intermediate cases , nnsd is described by brody formula @xcite :    [ eq - brody ] @xmath24 where @xmath3 and @xmath25 are determined by the parameter @xmath26 as follow : @xmath27^{\\beta+1}.\\ ] ]    this is a semiempirical formula characterized by the single parameter @xmath26 , popularly known as brody parameter .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the goe statistics and @xmath29 corresponds to the poisson statistics .",
    "apart from nnsd , the _ next_-nearest - neighbor spacings distribution ( nnnsd ) is also used to characterize the statistics of eigenvalues fluctuations .",
    "we calculate this distribution @xmath30 of next - nearest - neighbor spacings @xmath31 between the unfolded eigenvalues .",
    "factor of _ two _ at the denominator is inserted to make the average of next - nearest - neighbor spacings @xmath32 _ unity_. according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the nnnsd of goe matrices is identical to the nnsd of gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) matrices , i.e. , @xmath33 the nnsd and nnnsd reflect only local correlations among the eigenvalues .",
    "the spectral rigidity , measured by the @xmath0-statistic of rmt , gives information about the long - range correlations among eigenvalues and is more sensitive test for rmt properties of the matrix under investigation @xcite . in the following",
    "we describe the procedure to calculate this quantity .",

    "analysis of the random network follows rmt prediction for very long range of @xmath35 , which is not very surprising as random network follows rmt at each level starting from semi - circular density distributions .",
    "however interestingly scale - free and small - world networks also follow rmt for sufficiently large value of @xmath35 . beyond this value of @xmath35 ,",
    "deviation in the spectral rigidity is seen , indicating a possible breakdown of the universality .",
    "this is quite understandable as small - world network is highly clustered and scale - free network also has specific features like hubs , so it is natural that they are not as random as the random network .",

    "moreover , small - world network is generated exactly at small - world transition by using watts and strogatz algorithm which yields network with very high clustering coefficient and very less number of random connections .",
    "results presented in this paper show that these very small number of random connections make network _ sufficiently _ random to introduce the correlations among the eigenvalues for the sufficiently long range .    according to the many recent studies ,",
    "randomness in connections is one of the most important and desirable ingredients for the proper functionality or the efficient performance of systems having underlying network structures .",
    "for instance , information processing in brain is considered to be because of random connections among different modular structures @xcite .",
    "we feel that the role of random connections , and behavior and evolution of such systems can be studied better under the rmt framework . also this rmt approach may be used to detect the connections most responsible to increase the _ complexity _ of networks .",
    "for example effect of oxygen molecule on biochemical network of a metabolic system is recently studied and is shown to increase the complexity of the system leading to a major transition in the history of life @xcite .    in summary",

    "these results tell that random matrix theory , a very well developed branch of physics , can be applied to the complex networks studies .",
