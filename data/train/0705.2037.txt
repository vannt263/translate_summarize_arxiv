    ", we are now for the first time able to extend this shape analysis to a well resolved subhalo population .",
    "this is interesting from a theoretical point of view , because of the important role that tidal interactions play in shaping the properties of the subhalo population .",
    "the shapes of subhalos are likely to be affected by tidal deformations , and a careful analysis of the subhalo shapes might allow us to better understand the tidal interactions .",
    "knowledge of subhalo shapes is important for several types of observational studies as well .",
    "weak lensing is becoming a very valuable tool for probing cosmological parameters @xcite and constraining density profiles of galaxy groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "any alignment between intrinsic galaxy ellipticity and with other galaxies or the local mass density will introduce a bias into the lensing signal @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite found evidence for an intrinsic alignment , with subhalo minor axes preferentially perpendicular to the host halo s major axis , in a numerical simulation of four cluster scale halos , resolved with @xmath7 particles each .",
    "they also developed an analytical model under the assumption that this alignment was caused by the host halo s tidal field , and showed that it reproduces the numerical findings well .",
    "observational evidence for subhalo alignment has be found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , for galaxies in clusters @xcite as well as in groups @xcite . based on n - body numerical experiments @xcite concluded that the tidal field of a spherical cluster could be responsible for the observed radial alignment of cluster galaxy isophotes .",
    "a better understanding of typical subhalo shapes and their alignment within the host halo might allow a statistical correction of the resulting bias .",
    "another observational arena dependent on subhalo shapes are stellar kinematical studies of local group dwarf galaxies , which are being used to constrain the masses of their dm host halos @xcite . in almost all cases",
    "the analysis is performed assuming spherical symmetry and often also a constant velocity anisotropy .",
    "more sophisticated analyses of the dwarf galaxy stellar motions will benefit from firm theoretical expectations of the intrinsic dm subhalo shapes and should result in more realistic models of the underlying dm mass distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we briefly outline the technique we employed to determine the shape of subhalos .",
    "we present the shape parameters of the via lactea host halo in section  [ sec : hosthalo_shape ] , and move on in section  [ sec : subhalo_shape ] to discuss the dependence of the subhalo s shape parameters on the radius at which they are measured , on their distance from the center of the host , and on the subhalo s mass . in section  [ sec : subhalo_alignment ] we present results concerning the spatial distribution of the subhalos within the host halo and the alignment of their ellipsoids towards the host halo center . in section  [ sec : evolution ]",
    "we consider the redshift evolution of the shapes of a sample of strongly tidally affected subhalos .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains a discussion and summary of our results .",
    "the main sample of subhalos analyzed in this work stems from the @xmath8 output of the `` via lactea '' simulation ( paper i ) .",
    "this simulation follows the dark matter substructure of a milky - way - scale halo ( @xmath9 ) with 234 million particles . with a particle mass of @xmath10 ,",
    "the simulation resolves around 10,000 subhalos within @xmath11 kpc .",
    "the global @xmath8 properties of the host halo and the substructure population was presented in paper i and the joint temporal evolution of host halo and substructure properties , with an emphasis on tidal interactions , was discussed in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) . here",
    "we focus on the shapes of the matter distribution in via lactea s host halo and subhalo population .    for the determination of ( sub)halo shapes we follow the iterative technique outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method is based on diagonalizing the weighted moment of inertia tensor @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ellipsoidal distance in the eigenvector coordinate system between the ( sub)halo s center and the n@xmath14 particle , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the intermediate - to - major and minor - to - major axis ratios , respectively ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "initially @xmath18 is calculated for all particles within a spherical window of radius @xmath19 . in subsequent iterations",
    "we fix @xmath20 and include only particles with @xmath21 .",
    "iteration continues until @xmath22 and @xmath23 change by less than @xmath24 .",
    "the degree of triaxiality of a halo is quantified by the triaxiality parameter introduced by @xcite @xmath25 a halo is said to be oblate for @xmath26 , triaxial for @xmath27 , and prolate for @xmath28 .    for comparison with observational data",
    "it is often more desirable to constrain the shape of the potential than the shape of the density distribution .",
    "the potential shape has the additional advantage that it is less sensitive to local density variations ( from substructure for example ) and is typically smooth and well approximated by concentric ellipsoids @xcite . instead of measuring the potential shape directly , or by fitting ellipses to the intersections of isopotential surfaces with three orthogonal planes ( as advocated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we diagonalize the unweighted kinetic energy tensor @xmath29 where the @xmath30 are measured in the restframe of the subhalo under consideration .",
    "@xmath31 is related to the potential energy tensor @xmath32 through the tensor virial theorem @xmath33 the internal structure of the via lactea host halo remains practically unchanged after @xmath34 ( paper ii ) and we expect @xmath35 at @xmath8 . in that case the eigenvectors of @xmath31 should reflect the principal axes of the potential ellipsoid . note that the assumption of a constant @xmath36 is likely to fail for subhalos that are being tidally stripped , and in this case the principal axes of @xmath31 will not necessarily reflect the shape of the potential . instead of the iterative procedure applied for @xmath36 , we simply diagonalize @xmath31 for all particles within the moment of inertia ellipsoid at a given radius . in the following",
    "we will refer to shapes determined by diagonalization of @xmath36 and @xmath31 as the _ mass _ and _ potential _ shapes , respectively .",
    "at the present epoch the via lactea host halo is prolate .",
    "we have determined the principal components of @xmath36 and @xmath31 as a function of major axis radius .",
    "the resulting shape ellipsoids are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipsoids ] . neither the shape nor the orientation of the ellipsoids vary much out to @xmath37 . as a function of radius",

    "recall ( from paper ii , figs .  3 and 4 ) that the spherically averaged mass distribution of the via lactea host halo remains remarkably constant _ in proper coordinates _",
    "after the last major merger at @xmath34 until today .",
    "we now see , however , that the host halo does undergo some adjustments in its shape .    at @xmath8",
    "the mass distribution becomes slightly less spherical towards the center with axis ratios dropping from @xmath42 at 200 kpc @xmath43 to @xmath44 at 20 kpc , whereas the potential shape axis ratios remains constant at around 0.8 .",
    "the triaxiality parameter remains firmly in the prolate regime ( @xmath45 ) for both mass and potential throughout the entire halo .",
    "the potential shape becomes slightly more prolate in the inner regions . at earlier times , however , we detect some significant changes in the axis ratios , especially in the outer regions . at",
    "@xmath46 both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are larger by about 0.1 - 0.15 beyond 100 kpc , and at @xmath47 @xmath22 is significantly larger than @xmath23 , resulting in a triaxial , as opposed to prolate , outer region beyond @xmath48 kpc .",
    "the potential shape exhibits variations of comparable magnitude .",
    "note that the host halo accretes some fairly massive subhalos ( @xmath49 ) between @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "dynamical friction causes these subhalos to spiral in to the center over a few orbits , and they lose most of their mass ( @xmath50 ) in this process .",
    "the associated redistribution of material probably contributes to the observed shape adjustments .",
    "the shape of the via lactea host halo is consistent with previous studies of the shapes of dark matter halos , which have generally found them to be mostly prolate ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "observational studies of the shape of the milky way galaxy , however , have been much less conclusive .",
    "disk warping @xcite and some models of the sagittarius tidal stream @xcite suggest that the milky way halo is close to spherical ( @xmath51 ) and oblate , whereas some studies of the leading arm of the sagittarius stream favor a prolate shape with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the collisionless nature of our via lactea simulation prohibits a direct comparison between our findings and the observational constraints on the shape of the milky way host halo .",
    "previous hydrodynamical numerical studies of galaxy formation have found that the cooling of baryons leads to significantly rounder halos @xcite , especially in the central regions where s can increase by as much as 0.2 to 0.3 . at the moment",
    "it is unclear how much of this effect is due to a potential overcooling problem in these simulations .",

    "we now turn to the analysis of the shapes of via lactea s subhalos . unlike the host halo , which is resolved by over ten million particles even within @xmath53 ,",
    "the subhalo shape determination is limited by numerical resolution .",
    "we restrict our analysis to halos containing at least 5,000 particles within their tidal radius , @xmath54 . as in paper",
    "i , we define @xmath54 as the point where the subhalo s spherically averaged density profile drops to twice the local underlying matter density . via",
    "lactea contains 97 such halos within @xmath37 , 309 within @xmath3 , and 829 in total .",
    "one complication arises from the difficulty in distinguishing between actual subhalo particles and those belonging to the underlying host halo .",
    "our subhalo finder ( 6dfof , cf .",
    "paper i ) assigns all particles within the tidal radius to the subhalo , without removing unbound particles .",
    "some contribution to @xmath36 and @xmath31 would thus come from background particles .",
    "this contribution is generally negligible for @xmath36 , since the background particles are more or less uniformly distributed throughout the subhalo .",
    "the host halo particles , however , significantly distort @xmath31 , because their velocities are typically much larger and more anisotropic than the subhalo particle velocities , especially for subhalos close to the host halo center .",
    "for this reason we have cleaned the subhalos from background host halo particles by comparing the members of each subhalo to those of its progenitor in the penultimate simulation output at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 myr before @xmath8 ) , and retained only those particles that also appear within @xmath54 at the earlier time .",
    "this effectively removes all host halo particles from the subhalo and allows an accurate determination of @xmath31 .",
    "we have confirmed that the shape of @xmath36 is not affected by this cleaning procedure .    the subhalo tidal radius shrinks as subhalos pass through the inner regions of the host halo due to the increasing background density .",
    "however , as we showed in paper ii , not all particles beyond this reduced @xmath54 are actually stripped from the subhalo , and @xmath54 re - expands as the subhalo begins its climb out of the host halo potential .",
    "measuring the shape for all particles within the tidal radius thus probes more central regions for subhalos closer to the halo center than for subhalos in the outer regions . to avoid this bias we focus on the subhalo shapes for all particles within the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve , @xmath1 .",
    "this choice comes at the cost of a reduced number of particles , but @xmath1 does not temporarily decrease at pericenter passage .",

    "we first discuss the dependence of subhalo shape on the radius at which they are measured , see fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_vs_radius ] . for this analysis we included the complete sample of 829 halos with more than 5000 particles within their tidal radius .",
    "most of these halos currently lie outside of @xmath37 , but a significant fraction ( 78% within @xmath58 ) have passed through the host halo at some earlier time ( paper ii ) and have experienced tidal interactions . similarly to the via lactea host halo , we find that the subhalos mass distributions become slightly less spherical in the inner regions ; @xmath59 decreases from about 0.87 at @xmath60 to 0.68 at @xmath61 , the innermost point at which we determine subhalo shapes .",
    "similarly , @xmath62 decreases from 0.72 to about 0.45 .",
    "the 68% scatter is about 0.2 for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as expected the potential shape shows even less dependence on radius and is almost spherical , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the potential axis parameters also have a smaller 68% scatter of about @xmath65 .    unlike isolated dark matter halos , which tend to be prolate",
    ", we find that subhalos are generally triaxial .",
    "@xmath66 shows a slight decreasing trend with radius , but remains in the triaxial regime for both mass and potential shape throughout the range of radii that we probed .",

    "in addition to the mass shape ( _ solid lines , filled circles _ ) and the potential shape ( _ dashed lines , open circles _ ) , in the top two panels we also plot the shape parameters measured within @xmath54 ( _ dash - dotted lines , open triangles _ ) .",
    "the thin solid line indicates @xmath11 kpc . ]",
    "next we take a look at the dependence of subhalo shapes on the distance from the halo center . for this purpose",
    "we use the shapes determined from all particles within @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : shape_vs_distance ] shows that the shape of the mass distribution is close to independent of distance , with a weak but significant trend towards slightly larger axis ratios closer to the host halo center . within @xmath37",
    "the mean axis ratios are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and outside of @xmath37 they are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the potential shape is independent of distance , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the ellipsoids remains predominantly triaxial over the whole range of distance , for both mass and potential .",
    "one might have expected a stronger distance dependence , since the subhalo shapes are affected by tidal interactions , which are stronger at the center .",
    "this is likely a consequence of measuring the shapes within @xmath1 , which is deep inside the halo mass distribution , and not as strongly affected by tides .",
    "measuring the shapes within the tidal radius should give a more pronounced effect , and indeed , when we look at the trend vs. distance for shapes measured within @xmath54 ( dashed lines and open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_vs_distance ] ) we find that for the innermost bin the mean axis ratios decrease .",
    "at least part of this trend , however , may also be explained by the temporary decrease of @xmath54 as the subhalo passes through pericenter and the shape - radius dependence discussed in section  [ sec : shape_vs_radius ] .      .",
    "]    lastly , we consider the shape parameters as a function of the subhalo s @xmath2 , a proxy for mass , fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_vs_vcmax ] .",
    "again we use all 829 ( sub)halos in the simulation .",
    "@xcite found that the axis ratios of isolated field halos measured at @xmath74 decreased with increasing halo mass , i.e. less massive halos are more spherical .",
    "in contrast , we find no such trend for subhalos . with the exception of the highest mass bin ,",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 appear to be independent of @xmath2 .    the highest @xmath2 bin ( centered on @xmath75 , corresponding to a tidal mass of @xmath76 ) has @xmath77 , a bit less than would be expected from an extrapolation of the @xcite @xmath78 relation which gives @xmath79 at @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "all but one of the six halos in this bin lie within @xmath58 and can thus be considered subhalos . in @xcite shapes",
    "were measured at @xmath74 , whereas our subhalo shapes are measured at @xmath1 .",
    "we find it difficult to assign a `` virial '' radius to subhalos ( paper ii ) , and instead use the tidal radius @xmath54 as the outer `` edge '' of the subhalo",
    ". the median ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath54 in this bin is 0.16 , and for a @xmath80 field halo with a concentration of 15 @xmath82 , so it is likely that we are simply measuring the shapes farther in , where axis ratios tend to be smaller ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shape_vs_radius ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath83 when measured at @xmath54 .    at any rate ,",
    "our mean subhalo axis ratios become independent of mass at lower @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that tidal interactions cause this flattening of the subhalo shape - mass relationship .",
    "another possibility is that halo shapes ( for both subhalos and field halos ) are in fact intrinsically independent of mass when measured at a fixed physical scale , such as @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the mass dependence found at @xmath74 would in effect just be combination of radius dependence and the halo mass  concentration relation : @xmath74 is smaller than @xmath1 in massive , low concentration halos .",
    "this means that relative to @xmath1 , the shapes of more massive halos are probed at smaller radii , where axis ratios tend to be smaller .",
    "note that in this picture also the redshift dependence observed by @xcite might in part be a consequence of a window ( @xmath74 ) which becomes larger with time due to its co - moving definition .",
    "further investigations will be necessary to fully address this issue .",
    "having discussed the dependence of subhalo shapes on their properties , we now consider the spatial distribution and alignment within the host halo .",
    "the spatial distribution of subhalos depends sensitively on the sample selection criterion . in paper ii",
    "we showed that the @xmath8 distribution of via lactea subhalos is anti - biased compared to the mass distribution of the host halo . for subhalos selected to have a @xmath8 mass greater than @xmath84 ,",
    "the ratio of subhalo number density to host halo mass density is simply proportional to radius , whereas for subhalos selected to have a @xmath8 @xmath2 greater than @xmath85 , this ratio scales as the enclosed mass .",
    "previous studies have found that when subhalos are selected by their mass or @xmath2 at the time of accretion , this bias is substantially reduced , and the resulting subhalo number density profile more closely traces the underlying mass distribution @xcite .",
    "here we extend this analysis to a full 3d spatial distribution of the subhalos .",
    "in addition to the two samples considered in paper ii , we include a range of samples selected by the highest @xmath2 a subhalo reaches throughout its lifetime , a quantity we refer to as @xmath86. three of these samples are defined by lower limits , @xmath87 5 , 10 , and 15 @xmath88 , and three more by including the 100 , 500 , 1000 subhalos with the largest @xmath86 . this type of selection is designed to remove the bias introduced by tidal interactions , since the selection is performed on subhalo properties prior to their interaction with the host . for each sample of subhalos",
    "we diagonalize a weighted `` moment of inertia '' tensor ( eq.[eq : moi ] ) constructed from the @xmath8 positions of the subhalos , without regard for their masses .",
    "we then calculate the axis ratios of the resulting ellipsoids and the angles between their principal axes and the principal axes of the host halo s mass distribution measured at @xmath37 .",
    ".the 3d spatial distribution of subhalos [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have quantified these trends in fig .  [ fig : shape_evolution ] , where we plot each subhalo s radius , its axis ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and its @xmath89 as a function of time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 very closely tracks the orbit of the subhalo . every time a subhalo passes through pericenter its axis ratios decrease .",
    "note that part of this decrease can be attributed to the fact that the tidal radii shrink during pericenter passage , and so we are effectively measuring the subhalo shapes further in , where they are intrinsically less spherical ( see section  [ sec : shape_vs_radius ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath54 drops below @xmath1 only for one or two outputs close to pericenter , and for most of the orbit remains in the regime where the axis ratios are almost independent of radius .",
    "thus we conclude that the temporary decrease in @xmath54 at pericenter is not sufficient to explain the full extent of the correlation between axis ratios and orbital position .",
    "furthermore we see from the plot of @xmath89 that the subhalos are indeed pointing close to the host halo center for the majority of their orbits . during the fast pericenter passages @xmath89 drops significantly , but remains close to unity almost everywhere else .",
    "there are a few exceptions , where @xmath89 drops below unity even away from pericenter , for example at @xmath90 for # 04242 and at @xmath91 for # 10876 and # 13467 , and these are most likely caused by close passages to other massive subhalos .",
    "together these trends provide strong evidence for a tidal origin of the radial alignment of subhalos . as they orbit the host halo s center of mass",
    ", tidal forces continually distort the subhalos mass distribution , stretching them along the radial direction and compressing them in the perpendicular directions .",
    "this tidal distortion is stronger the closer the subhalo gets to the host halo center , but the pericenter passage occurs so quickly that the subhalo does not have enough time to adjust its orientation to point towards the center .",
    "our subsample , of course , was chosen to have experienced strong tidal interactions by requiring @xmath92 and at least 3 pericenter passages .",
    "however , as we showed in paper ii , more than half of all subhalos lose more than 50% of their mass from @xmath47 to @xmath8 , and so tidally caused radial alignment is expected for most subhalos . as mentioned above , subhalo # 21500 is one example of a subhalo that does not appear to experience much radial alignment .",
    "we found that of the 19 subhalos for which we performed a time dependent analysis , only three subhalos exhibit a similar lack of alignment - orbit correlation .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized in the following points .    *",
    "the shape of the via lactea host halo is prolate , and slightly less spherical ( lower axis ratios ) in the central regions .",
    "the shape of the potential ( @xmath93 ) is significantly rounder than the mass distribution ( @xmath94 ) . *",
    "whereas isolated halos tend to be prolate , we find that subhalos are predominantly triaxial .",
    "overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo .",
    "the mass shape has @xmath95 and @xmath96 , averaged over all subhalos within @xmath97 .",
    "the potential shape for these subhalos is very close to spherical , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . like isolated halos ,",
    "subhalos tend to be slightly less spherical in the central regions .",
    "* we find a weak trend towards larger axis ratios for subhalos closer to the host halo center . within @xmath37 @xmath67 and @xmath68 , compared with @xmath98 and @xmath99 for all subhalos outside of @xmath37 . * for subhalos with @xmath100",
    "the axis ratios are independent of @xmath2 . at higher",
    "@xmath2 they are slightly lower .",
    "* the spatial distribution of subhalos matches the prolate shape of the host halo when subhalos are selected by @xmath86 , the largest @xmath2 they ever had during their lifetime .",
    "this type of selection also results in an ellipsoidal radius dependence of the subhalo abundance that more closely follows the mass distribution of the host halo than the anti - biased distributions from selections based on @xmath8 subhalo properties like @xmath101 and @xmath2 . *",
    "the orientation of subhalo shape ellipsoids is not random .",
    "the major principal axis of the subhalo mass distribution tends to align with the direction towards the halo center .",
    "this alignment disappears for subhalos beyond @xmath102 and is more pronounced when the shape is measured in the outer regions of the subhalo . *",
    "tidal interactions with the host halo tend to make the subhalos rounder over time .",
    "* for the majority of subhalos whose temporal evolution we studied here in detail , the radial alignment is preserved during the subhalo s orbit , and the axis ratios decrease during pericenter passage .",
    "we conclude that the radial subhalo alignment is likely caused by tidal interactions with the host halo .",

    "<S> the principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass , when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like @xmath1 , the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve . </S>",
    "<S> subhalos tend to be slightly more spherical closer to the host halo center . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by the largest @xmath2 they ever had , i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> the subhalos orientation is not random : the major axis tends to align with the direction towards the host halo center . </S>",
    "<S> this alignment disappears for halos beyond @xmath3 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> the radial alignment is preserved during a subhalo s orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage , indicating that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo s tidal forces . these tidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time . </S>"
