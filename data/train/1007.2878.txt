    "since the first report from hosono s group@xcite of superconductivity at @xmath7=26 k in f - doped lafeaso , hundreds of experimental and theoretical papers on these iron - pnictide compounds have appeared , aimed at elucidating various properties , including synthesizing new compounds to achieve higher t@xmath8 , measuring basic quantities ( e.g. magnetic susceptibility , nmr , arpes ) , and modeling and simulating to obtain explanations and predictions .",
    "thanks to these efforts , there are now several families of these iron pnictide superconductors , including the 1111-family ( e.g. lafeaso , cafeasf ) , 122 family ( e.g. bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 ) , 111-family ( e.g. lifeas ) and a more complicated 22426-family ( e.g. fe@xmath9as@xmath9sr@xmath10sc@xmath9o@xmath11 ) , with t@xmath8 up to 56 k. [ ] several aspects have been clarified : the superconductivity lies in primarily iron @xmath0 bands@xcite and is not phonon - mediated;@xcite the ground state in most classes is a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with a significantly reduced fe magnetic moment compared to theoretically calculated value;@xcite it is a moderately correlated system where a coulomb interaction u@xmath123 ev might be appropriate .",
    "[ ] there is discussion that the superconducting order parameter may have a new @xmath13 character.@xcite    despite a great deal of progress in understanding the electronic structure@xcite and magnetic interactions,@xcite some basic questions remain unresolved .",
    "one of them is : what is the underlying mechanism of the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic in the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors ?",
    "this question is especially challenging in the 1111-compounds ( e.g. lafeaso ) , where the structural transition is observed ( as the temperature is lowered ) to occur before@xcite the magnetic transition ( from nonmagnetic to stripe antiferromagnetic order which we denote as q@xmath14 afm ) .",
    "it would have been natural to think that the stripe antiferromagnetic ordering of fe provides the driving force for the structural transition because it introduces electronic anisotropy .",
    "( table iii in reference [ ] provides a summary of the structural transition temperature t@xmath15 and stripe antiferromagnetic transition temperature t@xmath16 of several iron pnictide compounds . )    noting that the structural transition and magnetic transition occurs simultaneously in the 122 compounds ( e.g. bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 ) , a possible argument is that the magnetism is in fact present , in the form of medium - range order , antiphase boundaries , etc .",
    ", near the structural transition but its detection is greatly suppressed by strong spatial or temporal fluctuation . the suggestion by mazin and johannes that magnetic antiphase boundaries may be the dominant excitation@xcite has already stimulated numerical estimations by the present authors.@xcite with a time resolution of @xmath17 s , photoemission experiments by bondino _",
    "et al._@xcite implied a dynamic magnetic moment of fe with magnitude of 1 @xmath18 in the nonmagnetic phase of cefeaso@xmath19f@xmath20 , which is comparable to the ordered magnetic moment of fe in the undoped antiferromagnetic cefeaso compound",
    ". the fluctuation strength should be much stronger in 1111-compounds than 122 compounds based on the fact that the measured fe ordered magnetic moment in 1111-compounds ( @xmath21 0.4 @xmath18 ) is much less than in 122 compounds ( @xmath21 0.9 @xmath18 ) and they are much smaller than dft predicted value ( @xmath21 2 @xmath18).@xcite one factor is that interlayer coupling of feas layers is stronger in 122 compounds than 1111-compounds because the interlayer distance in 122 compounds ( @xmath216 @xmath22 ) is significantly smaller than 1111-compounds ( @xmath218 - 9 @xmath22).@xcite interlayer interaction should help to stabilize the ordered fe magnetic moment by reducing fluctuations ( reducing two dimensionality ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the effect of magnetic order , and of the pnictide atom , on the strength , character , and spin - dependence of fe - fe hopping processes by using a wannier function representation based on all five fe @xmath0 orbitals , and only these orbitals .",
    "several previous studies of the electronic structure have pointed out some aspects of the influence of the pnictide , or chalcogenide , atoms ( due to size or chemical identities ) and also of their positions.@xcite we provide one example of the effect of the pnictogen atom ( comparing lafaaso with lafepo ) in this paper , where the effect of the pnictogen is included precisely but indirectly through the wannierization process .",
    "this allows us to present results in an fe - centric picture .",
    "this local orbital representation provides insight into both electronic and magnetic behavior even when the fundamental behavior is primarily itinerant .",
    "we begin with first principle calculations using the full - potential local - orbital code@xcite ( fplo8 ) with local density approximation ( lda ) exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional@xcite ( pw92 ) and the experimental lattice constants and internal atomic coordinates for the compounds lafeaso and lafepo , as given in our previous work@xcite . to obtain a consistent local orbital representation and the resulting hopping amplitudes",
    ", we then construct real - space wannier functions ( wfs ) derived from fe @xmath0 orbitals in both nm and q@xmath14 afm phases .",
    "the wfs used in this paper , as implemented in the fplo8 code , are constructed by projecting the bloch functions from a specified energy range onto chosen atomic orbitals , roughly following the method of ku _",
    "et al._@xcite the resulting wannier orbitals retain a symmetry that is common to both the atomic orbital and the point group symmetry of the site .",
    "these wfs provide an explicit basis set of local orbitals that give a tight binding representation , complete with on - site energies and hopping amplitudes to neighbors as distant as necessary to represent the chosen bands .",
    "in this paper we project onto the conventional real fe @xmath0 orbitals , with the energy range corresponding to the region with strong fe @xmath0 character in the bands .",
    "the differences in electronic structure that we will emphasize result from the changes due to stripe magnetic order , and the differences between lafeaso with larger ordered moment , and lafepo , with smaller calculated moment ( experimentally nonmagnetic ) .",
    "the necessary band structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ as - fatband ] for lafeaso and [ p - fatband ] for lafepo , where in each case the fe @xmath6 and @xmath5 characters are highlighted .",
    "the total energy of lafepo , which is experimentally found to be nonmagnetic , is only slightly lower ( 2 mev / fe ) in the q@xmath14 afm phase than the nonmagnetic phase,@xcite so the incorrect prediction for lafepo is actually a fine detail , and suggests it is nearly antiferromagnetic .",
    "the calculated fe magnetic moment of lafepo in the q@xmath14 afm phase is 0.52 @xmath18 . in lafeaso ,",
    "the calculated moment is near 1.9@xmath18 , substantially larger than the measured value of 0.36 @xmath18 as has been widely discussed ( see , for example , refs . [ ] ) .    for our calculations and discussion",
    "we have chosen the @xmath4-axis along the direction of aligned fe spins , as shown in fig . [ hopping ] ; the corresponding zone boundaries are denoted x and y in the band plots .",
    "the nonmagnetic band structures of the two compounds are very similar , differing only in some fine details that do not arise in our analysis . however , the band structures in the q@xmath14 afm phase of the two compounds differ substantially , which is due to the difference in the fe magnetic moment ( 1.9 vs. 0.5 @xmath18).@xcite the similarities and differences provide a way to study the effect of magnetic order in these compounds , and specifically to show that even small magnetic order has substantial consequences .",
    "since the afm and nm phases in lafepo are nearly degenerate , our results have relevance to the effect of ( longitudinal ) magnetic fluctuations of the fe atom .",
    "the panels in fig .",
    "[ as - fatband ] illustrate that the magnetic order substantially simplifies the band structure very near the fermi level , which is all near @xmath23 in this doubled ( magnetic ) cell .",
    "the other difference to notice is the great difference in band structure along @xmath23-x and @xmath23-y directions .",
    "figure [ p - fatband ] shows the influence of a weak stripe antiferromagnetism ( 0.5 @xmath18 ) on the nonmagnetic band structure .",
    "the overall band structure remains the same except for some bands near the fermi energy , where the main change is the separating of the fe @xmath5 bands away from the fermi level , which causes disappearance and change of topology of certain pieces of the fermi surface of the fe @xmath5 bands .",
    "note that the fe @xmath6 bands change insignificantly , leaving the bands near the fermi level dominated by fe @xmath6 character .",
    "this difference indicates that even a weak stripe antiferromagnetism has a very strong symmetry breaking effect on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , which are equivalent in the nonmagnetic state . as a result",
    ", even a weak stripe antiferromagnetism induces a large anisotropy , let alone the much stronger ( calculated ) antiferromagnetism in feas - based compounds .",
    "( the much bigger anisotropy in the stripe afm phase in lafeaso is evident by comparing fig .",
    "[ as - fatband ] and [ p - fatband ] . )",
    "due to the strong influence of stripe antiferromagnetism on the band structure ( even when weak as in lafepo ) , the orbital distinction and repopulation of the fe @xmath5 and @xmath6 electrons suggests various means of analysis .",
    "the strong intra - atomic anisotropy discussed above is sometimes referred to as orbital ordering , but with the orbital occupations far from integers , the anisotropy also has a substantial itinerant ( collective ) component .",
    "here we consider briefly the alternative , local viewpoint .",
    "figure [ hopping ] shows two underlying ( idealized ) orbital populations , both of which are consistent with the q@xmath14 afm symmetry .",
    "( this orbital differentiation is often called `` orbital ordering , '' but based on the calculated populations , discussed below , this is more properly thought of as an itinerant cousin of orbital ordering . )",
    "@xmath24 denotes the hopping parameter of the @xmath25 hopping in the @xmath26 direction , and @xmath27 the @xmath28 hopping in the @xmath4 direction . in the nonmagnetic case , by symmetry @xmath29 whereas they differ in the q@xmath14 afm state .",

    "similar hopping parameters compared to lafeaso have been obtained for the cafeasf , srfeasf , and @xmath40fe@xmath9as@xmath9 ( @xmath40=ba , sr , ca ) compounds , ( which have similar feas layers ) , as shown in table [ iron - hopping ] . however , replacing as in lafeaso with other pnictides ( n , p and sb ) results in similar @xmath24 , @xmath27 and @xmath31 but different @xmath30 .",
    "compared to lafeaso , the @xmath30 for the majority spin electron in the q@xmath14 afm phase is reduced for lafeno and lafepo , but enhanced in lafesbo .",
    "the importance of the pnictide for the formation of the q@xmath14 afm phase is evident .    another important factor is the interlayer hoppings .",
    "the interlayer distance of feas layers in 1111-compounds is in the range of 8.2 -9.0 @xmath22 and it is much smaller in 122-compounds , ranging from 5.9 @xmath22 to 6.5 @xmath22 .",
    "the interlayer hopping parameters of fe @xmath0 electrons in the @xmath41 direction are negligible in 1111-compounds but become substantial for certain hoppings in 122-compounds , especially in cafe@xmath9as@xmath9 , whose interlayer distance of feas layers is only 5.9 @xmath22 .",
    "certain interlayer hopping parameters are as large as 0.15 ev for @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals , and 0.07 ev for @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath44 orbitals , calculated in the q@xmath14 afm phase for cafe@xmath9as@xmath9 , which has the smallest interlayer distance .",
    "the large interlayer hopping parameters for the fe @xmath42 orbital , which at first sight seems very surprising , becomes clear by noting that the @xmath42 wannier orbital is strongly distorted from its symmetric atomic shape to its nearest neighbor as atoms above and below the fe plane , as shown in fig.4 in the original paper .",
    "this extension in the @xmath41 direction will favor interlayer hoppings , especially when the interlayer distance is small , as in the case of cafe@xmath9as@xmath9 .",
    "for comparison , the interlayer hopping parameters ( if not zero ) are less than 0.01 ev in lafeaso .",
    "the increasing hopping of fe @xmath0 electrons in the @xmath41 direction increases the interlayer coupling , and may inhibit fluctuations and thereby help to stabilize the ordered fe magnetic moment in the q@xmath14 afm phase .",
    "the @xmath45 dispersion correlates with the experimental observations that the measured fe magnetic moments in the q@xmath14 afm phase are significantly larger in 122-compounds ( @xmath21 0.9 @xmath18 ) than 1111-compounds ( @xmath21 0.4 @xmath18 ) ."
