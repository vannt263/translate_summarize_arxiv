    "the interest in inclusive decays of heavy mesons is two - fold : experimental study of such decays can provide important information on the weak mixing angles of heavy mesons , and a theoretical treatment of such processes which includes also nonperturbative effects is possible . the theoretical framework based on combining the operator product expansion ( ope ) and heavy quark ( hq ) expansion provides decay rates and differential distributions as series in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass with the coefficients proportional to the matrix elements of the operators of a proper dimension @xcite .",
    "a remarkable property of this expansion is that in the leading - order this is just the free - quark decay , and the first correction appears only at order @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand it is understood that the quark - hadron duality technically implemented through the ope is an approximate framework @xcite .",
    "for example , the calculation based on ope does not take into account all details of the hadron spectrum which lead to the dependence of the set of open decay channels on the momentum transfer .",
    "the ope ignores this fact and this inevitably yields some errors in the ope results @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description based on the ope represents the decay rate as a contour integral in the complex @xmath9-plane ( for details see the next section ) . the ope can be justified only in regions of the complex @xmath9-plane away from the physical region , whereas in the case of the calculation of the decay rate ( both differential and integrated ) the contour always involves a segment which is close to the physical region @xcite .",
    "this can lead to duality - violating effects , i.e. the difference between the exact and the ope based results .    however , it is not easy to estimate the errors arising in the ope , since the exact hadron spectrum in qcd is complicated and not exactly known .",
    "so , testing directly the accuracy of the quark - hadron duality is only possible in few exceptional cases .",
    "examples discussed in the literature are qcd in the shifman - voloshin ( sv ) limit @xcite , and the t hooft model @xcite .    in the t hooft model ( 2-dimensional qcd with @xmath10 )",
    "the spectrum is reduced to an infinite number of single bound states and known precisely so that the direct summation of exclusive channels is possible .",
    "first numerical analysis of the sum over exclusive channels reported the presence of the duality - violating @xmath11 correction for the total width @xcite . later",
    "the summation was performed analytically for the case of a massless light quark @xcite .",
    "the result of the ope calculation agreed with the exact result in this case through @xmath12 order .",
    "duality in qcd in the sv limit @xcite has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this limit requires @xmath13 .",
    "a peculiar feature of the sv limit is that a summation over exclusive channels becomes possible due to kinematical reasons : the process occurs near the zero recoil and thus only few decay channels contribute in the leading @xmath11 order .",
    "the expansion of the relevant transition form factors in this kinematical region is known and the sum over exclusive channels can be evaluated .",
    "the absence of @xmath14 corrections to the free - quark result in the semileptonic ( sl ) decay rate has been demonstrated in @xcite . however , to check the absence of @xmath14 and @xmath15 corrections within the sv kinematics is not enough to ensure duality in the @xmath11 order in the general case , beyond the sv limit .",
    "namely , one should also check that potentially large terms of order @xmath16 which are present in individual decay rates cancel in the sum over exclusive channels .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath17 terms in the exclusive sum was performed in @xcite for qcd in the @xmath18 case .",
    "it was found that the duality within this accuracy requires a new sum rule .",
    "the full comparison to higher orders has not yet been performed .",
    "we study the quark - hadron duality in the sv limit within a nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "the model has several features which make it especially suitable for this purpose : the model is self - consistent in the sv limit ; the spectrum of bound states is relatively simple and can be calculated ; the exact representations of the transition form factors in terms of the hadron wave functions are known .",
    "these features provide a possibility to calculate the exclusive sum .",
    "we adopt a technical simplification of a lorentz scalar current instead of the @xmath18 current , like it is done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of our analysis is to check whether or not the ope result calculated to some order is equal to the sum over exclusive channels expanded to the same order .",
    "both series are double expansions in powers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "they are asymptotic series @xcite , and the question of their convergence is left for a later publication @xcite .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * we construct the expansion of the @xmath21-product of the two currents in a series of local operators ( the ope ) in the potential model for a general form of the quark potential . technically this is done by the expansion of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "we consider the expansion to all orders in @xmath20 but neglect terms @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this ope series provides the expansion of the differential and integrated semileptonic decay rates in powers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "+ let us point out that the ope series in the potential model has an important distinction from the wilsonian scheme in the field theory : namely , in qcd ( perturbative ) contributions of small distances below the scale @xmath24 is referred to the wilson coefficients while contributions of large distances above this scale is referred to the matrix elements of the local operators . as a result",
    "both the @xmath25-number wilson coefficients and the matrix elements of the local operators acquire the @xmath26-dependence . in the potential model",
    "we also expand the average of the @xmath21-product of the two current operators over the @xmath27 meson in a series of local operators , but the resulting @xmath25-number coefficents as well as the average values of the local operators ( see eq.([ope ] ) ) do not have a scale dependence . *",
    "the ope and the sum over exclusive channels are related to each other by sum rules , similar to the bjorken @xcite , the voloshin @xcite , and the whole tower of higher moments @xcite .",
    "we derive these sum rules .",
    "they involve an infinite sum of terms corresponding to all hadronic excitations , with each term having a well - defined heavy mass expansion .",
    "the question of the heavy mass expansion of the sum ( in other words , of the uniform convergence of the series ) has not been tackled in this paper .",
    "if the contribution of higher excitations vanishes rapidly enough the uniform convergence is expected . *",
    "the ope provides a heavy mass expansion for the inclusive semileptonic decay rate . to compare it with the result of summation over exclusive semileptonic decay channels we make use of the sum rules . an explicit difference between the two expressions",
    "is found , both for the integrated and the differential rates .",
    "this difference corresponds to the contribution of the resonances kinematically forbidden in the decay process which are picked up by the ope .",
    "this unphysical contribution is related to the poles in the complex @xmath9-plane outside the physical region which however contribute to the ope result .",
    "the size of this duality - violation can not be estimated in all generality since it depends on the potential and on the convergence properties of the sums over resonances .",
    "* for the integrated decay rate the ope prediction and the sum over exclusive channels match , _ up to the duality - violating contributions of higher resonances _ , within the @xmath3 order : terms of order @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which are present in any individual decay rate cancel in the sum over all channels thanks to the bjorken @xcite and voloshin @xcite sum rules , respectively . for terms of order @xmath30 , @xmath31 , etc the agreement ( _ again up to contributions of higher resonances _ )",
    "is provided by the higher moment sum rules .",
    "the duality - violation induced by the kinematical truncation of these higher resonances in general has the order @xmath6 where @xmath32 depends on the details of the potential @xmath33 both at large and small @xmath34 .",
    "+ for the smeared differential distributions near maximal @xmath35 the violation of the _ local duality _ is found at the order @xmath5 .",
    "we make an explicit proof of the present results for the special case of the harmonic oscillator potential in ref .",
    "this is important since some demonstrations given below are rather formal .    in the next section we present some details of the kinematics and discuss the analytical properties of the decay amplitude . in section 3",
    "the @xmath11 expansion of the quark propagator is performed and the ope series for the sl decay rate in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is constructed . in section 4",
    "we consider the hq expansion of the exclusive form factors in the potential model , and derive the inclusive sum rules ( bjorken , voloshin , etc . ) which are crucial for comparing the exclusive sum and the ope result . in section 5",
    "we provide an analytic expression for the duality - violation contribution and identify its origin .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of the ope both for the integrated rate and the smeared distribution near zero recoil .",
    "a special emphasis is laid on discussing the role of different inclusive sum rules in establishing the relationship between the ope and the sum over the exclusive channels .",
    "conclusion summarizes our results .",
    "we consider the inclusive sl decay @xmath36 .",
    "the rate of this process reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the leptonic tensor , and the hadronic tensor @xmath39 is defined as follows @xmath40 here the relativistic normalization of states is implied @xmath41    for the sake of clarity we assume the technical simplification that the leptons are coupled to hadrons through the _ scalar current _ current and massless leptons , the leptonic tensor has the form @xmath42 , and for the scalar current @xmath43 .",
    "we consider throughout the paper the leptonic tensor of the generalized form @xmath44 . ] . in this case",
    "the leptonic tensor is a scalar function of only one variable , @xmath35 , and the hadronic tensor @xmath39 depends on the two invariant variables @xmath45 and @xmath35 . in the rest frame of the @xmath27-meson",
    "these are @xmath9 and @xmath35 . at @xmath46 and fixed @xmath35 the sum in ( [ w ] ) runs over the hadronic states with masses @xmath47 .",
    "the decay rate can be written as follows @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently , we can use @xmath9 and @xmath50 .",
    "let us consider the @xmath51 as an analytical function of @xmath9 at fixed @xmath50 .",
    "one can write the following relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 is the energy of the state with the mass @xmath55 and the total 3-momentum @xmath56 .",
    "the sum over @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) for @xmath21 runs over _ all _ hadron states with the appropriate quantum numbers . the selection of the states kinematically allowed in the decay process is made by the proper choice of the integration contour in the complex @xmath9 plane .",
    "namely , the decay rate @xmath2 can be represented as the contour integral in the complex @xmath9 plane over the contour @xmath58 which depends on the value of @xmath50 ( fig 1 ) as follows @xmath59    it is important that the left crossing of the contour @xmath60 with the real axis in the complex @xmath9 plane occurs at the point @xmath61 , otherwise the contour can be freely deformed in the region where the function @xmath62 is analytic .",
    "we symbolically mark this constraint with a @xmath63-function in the integrand .",
    "the integration over such contour selects at any given @xmath50 only physical states which can be produced in the decay @xmath0 , i.e. states with the invariant masses such that @xmath64 .",
    "notice that whereas the left crossing of the contour with the real axis is tightly fixed at the point @xmath65 , @xmath66 , the right crossing of the contour with the real axis can be safely moved to the right . in the general relativistic case",
    "there are cuts which correspond to other physical processes . in the sv limit",
    "these cuts are separated from the physical decay cut by windows of the width @xmath67 . in the potential quark model",
    "such cuts are absent .    the amplitude @xmath68 is given by the @xmath21-product of the two local current operators , which is the classical case for performing the ope .",
    "namely , one has @xmath69 where @xmath70 are local operators and @xmath71 are the @xmath25-number coefficients . introducing the expansion ( [ ope ] ) into ( [ ratecontour ] ) gives the integrated rate as a sum over various local operators .",
    "we shall obtain the integrated sl decay rate within our model by the two means : first , we construct the ope series for @xmath72 , and second , we calculate directly the sum over exclusive channels .",
    "we consider this decay in the sv limit , @xmath73 notice that in a non - relativistic model , @xmath74 refers to a fixed energy scale proportional to the light quark mass @xmath75 , to the average quark momentum in the hadron rest frame @xmath76 , to the parameter @xmath77 defined in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) and @xmath78 or @xmath79 to be defined in eq .",
    "( [ epsb ] ) .",
    "these parameters may be strongly hierarchized , for example a genuine non - relativistic situation implies @xmath80 , but all these quantities remain constant as @xmath81 , they remain proportional to some fixed hadronic scale which we call @xmath74 by analogy with qcd .",
    "this is to be distinguished from @xmath82 which is taken as an independent parameter .",
    "thus we consider the double limit @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "notice finally that @xmath85 is of order @xmath82 .    to avoid confusion , it is important to stress that the standard ope expansion assumes @xmath15 constant , even if small .",
    "so the order of a term @xmath86 in this paper corresponds to the order @xmath87 of the standard ope expansion .",
    "we treat the leptonic part relativistically , but for the calculation of the hadronic tensor we use the nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "the nonrelativistic treatment of the hadronic tensor is consistent within the sv kinematics and can be used as a tool for studying some of the aspects of quark - hadron duality .",
    "we shall make use the fact that in the nonrelativistic potential model we know the structure of the hadron spectrum and have an exact representation for the hadronic matrix elements of the quark currents .",
    "it is convenient to use the nonrelativistic normalization of states ( which is used hereafter ) @xmath88 and consider the process in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath27-meson .",

    "let us specify the transition current operator @xmath108 .",
    "for the sake of argument we neglect the quark spin effect and consider spinless nonrelativistic quarks and choose the quark current in the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath111 quark.=@xmath112 and in the nonrelativistic limit takes the form @xmath113 . neglecting the factor @xmath114 as done in eq .",
    "( [ qcurrent ] ) leads to technical simplifications both in the ope and in the exclusive sum .",

    "( [ local ] ) means that local duality near maximal @xmath35 is violated at order @xmath339 . as we have seen , the dangerous terms of this order are cancelled in the integrated rate against similar contributions of other channels due to the voloshin sum rule",
    ". however , the @xmath340 violation of the local duality might have negative consequences for the application of the method to the analysis of the experimental results .",
    "for example this happens if one observes only a small part of the phase space near maximal @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we have studied quark - hadron duality in decays of heavy mesons in the sv limit using the nonrelativistic potential model for the description of mesons as @xmath341 bound states .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * the ope is constructed and the following @xmath19 and @xmath20 double series is found for the integrated decay rate : @xmath342 where @xmath343 are calculable constants and @xmath344 depends on the leptonic tensor . *",
    "the hq expansion of the transition form factors in the nonrelativistic potential model is performed .",
    "a nonrelativistic analog of the luke theorem for the exclusive transition form factor between the ground states is obtained .",
    "+ it is shown that the sum of the squares of the @xmath345 transition form factors are expressed through the expectation values of the operators emerging in the ope series .",
    "these nonrelativistic analogs of the bjorken , voloshin , and higher order sum rules provide a bridge between the sum over exclusive channels and the ope series . *",
    "the integrated decay rate is calculated by direct summation of exclusive channels . for the comparison of this directly calculated @xmath346 and the corresponding @xmath347 the sum rules are necessary . a difference ( duality - violation ) between the two expressions is observed . as shown explicitly by the use of the sum rules ,",
    "this difference is connected with the higher @xmath348 resonances which are forbidden kinematically in the decay process but are implicitly taken into account in the ope approach . therefore the accuracy of the ope is directly related to the error induced by the kinematical truncation in the sum rules ( bjorken , voloshin , etc ) .",
    "the actual error depends on the convergence of the series , i.e. on the nature of the potential .",
    "we have discussed the constraints on the latter convergence which lead to the duality violation of order @xmath6 with @xmath32 depending on the behavior of the potential both at the short and long distances . _ up to the mentioned duality - violation _ , the agreement between the ope and the exclusive sum is achieved within different @xmath166 orders due to different reasons : + the leading order and the subleading @xmath328 and @xmath19 orders the free quark integrated decay rate @xmath349 is equal to the rate of the transition into the ground state @xmath334 .",
    "this is due to the specific behavior of the transition form factor between the ground states near the zero recoil ( luke theorem ) .",
    "also part of the @xmath30 correction in the ope result proportional to the @xmath350 matches to the contribution of the ground state @xmath334 in the exclusive sum .",
    "+ for higher order terms the agreement between the ope and the exclusive sum is a collective effect due to subtle cancellations in the sum over exclusive channels : + namely , each of the individual decay rates @xmath351 contain potentially large terms of the order @xmath4 and @xmath294 .",
    "these terms cancel in the exclusive sum due to the bjorken and voloshin sum rules , respectively .",
    "the higher order sum rules allow us to represent the contribution of exclusive channels in terms of the average values of the operators @xmath352 over the @xmath27-meson state . *",
    "if the differential semileptonic decay widths are considered near maximum @xmath35 , the violation of the local duality occurs at order @xmath340 .",
    "clearly , in qcd the situation is more complicated because of the multiparticle @xmath353 states , pion emission , hybrid and multiquark exotic @xmath354 mesons , radiative corrections .",
    "nevertheless the duality violation due to the kinematical truncation of the series should be quite similar to the case of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . also similar",
    "is the role of the inclusive sum rules in obtaining the duality relations .",
