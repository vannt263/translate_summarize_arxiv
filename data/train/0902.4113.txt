    "the dynamics of rods and semiflexible fibers are strongly influenced by their mutual uncrossability .",
    "examples include carbon nanotubes @xcite , fd - virus @xcite , and biologically relevant polymers such as actin @xcite and tubulin @xcite .",
    "already at surprisingly low concentrations , uncrossability in such systems leads to a temporary and anisotropic `` cage '' or tube from which the rod or fiber can only escape through anisotropic motion ( reptation ) @xcite or through collective motion , as exemplified by the collective reorientation observed in sheared concentrated rod suspensions @xcite .    besides the mutual uncrossability constraint ,",
    "the dynamics of rods and fibers are also influenced by brownian forces ( due to random collisions with solvent molecules ) and hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) mediated by the solvent .",
    "the role of his in entangled suspensions of brownian rigid rods and semiflexible fibers has remained , with a few exceptions , largely unexplored .",
    "this is caused by the difficulty of treating brownian dynamics , hydrodynamics , and entanglements within one theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "his are dominant in the dilute and onset of the semidilute regime .",
    "for example , the scaling of the relaxation times of the normal modes ( rouse modes ) in an unentangled bead - spring chain changes from @xmath0 for a chain without his to @xmath1 for a chain with his ( zimm scaling ) @xcite .",
    "here @xmath2 is the number of beads and mode @xmath3 measures correlated motion on a length scale of @xmath4 beads .",
    "also the diffusion and segmental dynamics of dilute dna molecules are controlled by hydrodynamic interactions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is believed that his are effectively screened in very concentrated suspensions and to a certain extent also in semidilute suspensions in equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "the onset of the semidilute regime already occurs at lower concentrations for rigid rods than for flexible chains of equal contour length @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a smaller dynamic correlation length in a semidilute suspension of rigid rods than in an equally concentrated suspension of flexible chains .",
    "indeed , pryamitsyn and ganesan have shown that the effects of his in semidilute and concentrated suspensions of completely rigid brownian rods ( with aspect ratio up to 20 ) are secondary relative to the steric interactions @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that his modify the diffusion parallel to the rod , in agreement with theories of hydrodynamic screening @xcite . in all probability , the importance of his is decreasing with increasing chain stiffness and/or increasing concentration , but it is difficult to predict in general under which conditions his can be neglected .",
    "the need to consider his becomes particularly important when considering non - equilibrium situations .",
    "there are various applications where fibers are dragged along by flow or where the fibers generate flow because they are dragged by an external field .",
    "examples include flow through microchannels @xcite , sedimentation or electrophoresis of fibers @xcite , and active microrheology @xcite . in active microrheology",
    "a colloidal bead is embedded in a medium and driven by magnetic or optical forces .",
    "the force - displacement response is measured with the goal to locally measure the rheology of the medium . in case of a medium consisting of a fiber network ,",
    "it is important for the interpretation of these experiments to understand the hydrodynamic coupling between fluid flow generated by the probe bead on the one hand , and the fiber network on the other hand .",
    "the work presented here is part of a long - term effort to generate this understanding .",
    "coupling between fluid flow and fiber dynamics may be especially important when the probe bead is smaller than the mesh size of the network @xcite . even for probe sizes in between the mesh size and the fiber contour length interesting new mechanisms",
    "may be observed @xcite .",
    "computer simulations in which his , entanglements , and brownian motion are treated on an equal footing may help in gaining insight in the dynamics of brownian fiber suspensions .",
    "first , let us focus on hydrodynamics . to rigorously include his in a simulation requires a decomposition of the mobility tensor , which is typically an @xmath5 operation @xcite , although with certain approximations ( expanding force distributions along rods in legendre polynomials and retaining only lower order terms ) this can be made more efficient @xcite .",
    "another approach is to explicitly include the solvent .",
    "the large gap in time- and lengthscales between the solvent molecules and colloidal sized particles has led to the development of mesoscopic simulation techniques which avoid the computationally costly explicit treatment of every solvent molecule .",
    "important developments in this area are lattice boltzmann ( when extensions to allow for thermal fluctuations are included ) @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite , and multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite .",
    "the latter , in its original implementation @xcite , is also known as stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) .",
    "all these mesoscopic simulation techniques account for correlated motion of the solvent which leads to long - range hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "second , let us focus on the entanglements .",
    "most existing methods implement non - crossing by resorting to explicit repulsive interactions .",
    "the dynamics of relatively short non - crossing rods may be modeled by means of forcefields with ellipsoidal or spherocylindrical geometry @xcite , whereas non - crossing rods or chains are often modeled by representing them as a string of relatively hard beads with bonds that are sufficiently strong to make the crossing of two such chains energetically unfavourable @xcite .",
    "although popular for its simple implementation , the latter approach has two disadvantages .",
    "firstly , a large amount of beads is needed to represent very long or very thin fibers or chains .",
    "secondly , the use of hard excluded volume interaction potentials necessitates small time steps to accurately integrate the equations of motion .",
    "this makes the calculation of the dynamics of long thin rods and fibers computationally very costly .",
    "a few off - lattice methods exist that implement non - crossing chains without resorting to explicit repulsive interactions .",
    "examples include a brownian dynamics acception / rejection scheme by ramanathan and morse @xcite and the twentanglement method of padding and briels @xcite .",
    "both methods , however , are based on brownian dynamics without his .",
    "this means that solvent - mediated interactions between the embedded chain segments are ignored .",
    "rather , the segments feel a certain friction with a fictitious static background fluid , as well as random forces .",
    "i will describe an efficient simulation algorithm for non - crossing fibers that includes hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the method presented here relies on the srd method to establish his between fiber or chain segments . in srd",
    "a solvent is represented by @xmath6 ideal particles of mass @xmath7 . after propagating the particles for a time @xmath8 , the system is partitioned into cubic cells of volume @xmath9 ( with a random grid shift to conserve galilean invariance @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities relative to the center of mass velocity of each separate cell are rotated over a fixed angle around a random axis . this procedure conserves mass , momentum , and energy and yields the correct hydrodynamic ( navier - stokes ) equations , including the effect of thermal noise @xcite . the solvent particles only interact with each other through the rotation procedure , which can be viewed as a coarse graining of particle collisions over time and space . for this reason , the particles",
    "should not be interpreted as individual molecules but rather as a navier - stokes solver that naturally includes brownian noise .",
    "the fiber or chain segments will be coupled to this hydrodynamic solvent by also taking part in the rotation procedure . with appropriately chosen simulation parameters",
    "@xcite , such an approach leads to correct hydrodynamic behaviour of polymeric chains , as shown recently by winkler et al .",
    "@xcite . from the point of view of the latter work ,",
    "this paper is an extension of the hydrodynamic method to also include uncrossability of the chains .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "a simple chain model is introduced in section [ model ] .",
    "the non - crossing algorithm is described in detail in section [ alg ] .",
    "the choice of simulation parameters is rationalised in section [ parameters ] and a validation and some results of the method are given in section [ test ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "in this work a fiber or chain is represented by a string of vertices located at positions @xmath10 @xmath11 , with each vertex carrying a mass @xmath12 .",
    "the non - crossing algorithm described in the next section is generally applicable to any model in which the interactions between connected vertices are described by potential energy terms .",
    "the model fiber or chain can achieve the right compressibility and bending stiffness by associating a bonding potential energy with each bond and an angular potential energy with each bend between two successive bonds .",
    "specifically , the potential energy of a bond @xmath13 with length @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the elastic modulus of the fiber or chain and @xmath17 is the equilibrium distance between each successive vertex .",
    "two successive bonds @xmath18 and @xmath13 with unit bondvectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 make an angle @xmath21 at vertex @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the potential energy associated with this angle is given by @xmath24 this particular form is chosen for the relative computational ease of calculating @xmath25 ( rather than @xmath21 ) . if @xmath26 the angles will typically be small and the angular potential reduces to @xmath27 .",
    "such a potential ensures that the persistence length of the fiber or chain is equal to @xmath28 , as desired .",
    "note that more realistic ( non - linear ) bond and angle potentials , as well as torsional stiffness effects , may be included but are ignored for simplicity .",
    "in order to prevent chain crossing , a rule for the detection and treatment of bond - bond collisions needs to be devised .",
    "if hydrodynamic behaviour is to be retained , this collision rule must be compatible with the laws of conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "the most detailed approach would be to construct an event - driven algorithm in which a list of possible future collisions is generated and time progresses discretely from one collision instant to the next .",
    "it is possible , but rather cumbersome , to combine such a variable timestep algorithm with the fixed timestep srd algorithm .",
    "however , resolving the collisions to such detail is not in the same _ spirit _ as the srd algorithm . in srd",
    "one does not specify the exact locations of the collisions between the solvent particles , but attains a rather more coarse grained view : collisions take place anywhere within the volume of a collision cell , anytime during the collision time interval . technically , during the collision step the solvent particles are not actually displaced , they only exchange momentum and energy .",
    "this has proven to be sufficient for hydrodynamic behaviour of the solvent .    in this work a similar fixed timestep idea",
    "is used for the collisions between chain bonds .",
    "it is unnecessary to specify the exact locations of the collisions .",
    "rather , chain vertices are picked in random order and moved according to their velocities , except if this motion results in a collision with another chain @xcite . in the latter case momentum and energy",
    "are exchanged between the vertices surrounding the colliding bonds . by moving the chain",
    "vertices one - by - one instead of all at once , the detection and treatment of the collisions are greatly simplified at the cost of accuracy in the collision location .",
    "it is necessary to use a random permutation for the order in which the vertices are picked , because otherwise bias may be introduced in successive collisions between the same pair of bonds .",
    "the solvent particles of mass @xmath7 located at positions @xmath29 @xmath30 are treated as usual in srd . both solvent particles and chain vertices take part in the grid cell based collision step ; this ensures that the chains are hydrodynamically coupled to the solvent .",
    "the algorithm may be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "read in coordinates @xmath31 and velocities @xmath32 of the solvent particles and chain vertices .",
    "advance solvent positions over a timestep @xmath33 @xmath34 apply periodic boundary or wall conditions to solvent coordinates .",
    "3 .   create a randomly permuted list of all vertices .",
    "try moving chain vertex @xmath10 from this list according to @xmath35 check for crossing of the bond @xmath18 with another bond .",
    "do the same for the bond @xmath13 .",
    "if a chain crossing occurs then reject this move , but exchange momentum and energy with the first collision partner .",
    "if no chain crossing occurs then accept this move .",
    "apply periodic boundary or wall conditions to chain vertex coordinates .",
    "details of crossing detection and momentum and energy exchange are given below .",
    "( may be performed less frequent : ) the srd collision step .",
    "create a random - shifted grid and perform random collisions of solvent and chain vertices within each grid cell according to @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the centre - of - mass velocity of all solvent and vertex particles in that particular cell and @xmath38 is a rotation matrix which rotates velocities by a fixed angle @xmath39 around a randomly oriented axis .",
    "rescale velocities relative to centre - of - mass velocity if thermostatting is required . 5 .",
    "calculate vertex - vertex potential forces and possibly body forces for all particles : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "advance velocities of solvent and vertices based on forces @xmath42 7 .",
    "if the number of required time steps has not yet been reached , go to step 2 .",
    "save coordinates and velocities of the solvent particles and chain vertices .",
    "most of the above algorithm is standard for srd ( note that in this version a leap - frog verlet algorithm is used @xcite ) , except for step 3 .",
    "if the update of the positions of the chain vertices would be treated similarly to step 2 , then chains would be able to cross .",
    "more details on step 3 are given in the next subsections .",

    "i will focus on the semidilute , low - volume fraction case where excluded volume is relatively unimportant ( for example , the volume fraction will be such that no spontaneous nematic ordering will occur in the equivalent experimental system ) .",
    "however , for completeness , here follows an outline of the changes that need to be made to the algorithm ; a detailed account will be given in a separate paper .",

    "the tube stretches from @xmath22 to @xmath75 .",

    "for a fiber suspension this could be the persistence length , i.e. @xmath145 . for micrometer sized objects , the re is usually very small ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "the reynolds number can be kept small by ensuring that the flow velocities do not exceed some maximum ( this should be monitored during the simulation ) and by choosing a relatively high kinematic viscosity .",
    "again , the latter may be done by choosing a small collision interval @xmath8 .",
    "the definitions of the mach and reynolds numbers above depend on the chosen relevant length scale as well as the characteristic flow velocity . in table",
    "[ table_parameters ] we report ma and re for shear flow with shear rate @xmath121 , where the relevant length scale of a semiflexible fiber is the persistence length , and the characteristic flow velocity is the maximal velocity difference over this length scale .",
    "lastly , it is important that the relative importance of convective transport to diffusive transport is comparable between experiment and simulation .",
    "this is expressed by the peclet number @xmath147 where @xmath74 is the self - diffusion coefficient of the fiber . alternatively , under shear",
    "flow the peclet number can be defined as the product of applied shear rate and the ( brownian ) rotational relaxation time @xmath148 of the fiber or chain . in this respect",
    "it should be noted that the absence of excluded volume interactions facilitates the simulation of very long and thin fibers , with very large characteristic times .",
    "for example , the characteristic times associated with rotational , perpendicular and parallel motion of a stiff rod scale like @xmath149 $ ] , with @xmath150 weak functions of the aspect ratio @xmath3 @xcite . in the large @xmath3 limit",
    ", the friction perpendicular to the rod is twice that in the parallel direction .",
    "this large @xmath3 limit is reached ( within a few percent accuracy ) for @xmath3 in the order of 30 @xcite .",
    "therefore , a connection between time in a simulation of rods with @xmath151 and time in an experiment with much longer rods can be made by identifying the rotational relaxation time of the simulated rods with the rotational relaxation time in the experiment .",
    "although momentum is conserved locally in all solvent and bond collisions , the method presented here is not strictly galilean invariant .",
    "remember that a bond which exchanges momentum with its collision partner is not actually displaced . in this step reference",
    "is made to an absolute reference frame : the centre - of - mass of the collision partners should have been displaced over a distance @xmath152 , where @xmath37 is the centre - of - mass velocity of the collision partners .",
    "the influence of neglecting this centre - of - mass motion in one time step can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently small molecular dynamics step @xmath33 .",
    "when the _ number _ of time steps in which a particular bond collides is much smaller than the number of time steps in which the bond is moving according to its given velocity , correct dynamics is recovered .",
    "as it turns out , the above condition is not limiting the efficiency of the method , for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the ratio of bond length @xmath17 to mesh size @xmath153 is usually small , making collisions relatively rare for each particular bond .",
    "secondly , the molecular dynamics time step @xmath33 already needs to be chosen relatively small to resolve the dynamics of the relative stiff springs needed to represent real fibrillar materials , such as actin .",
    "thirdly , the mach number limit introduced above already limits the allowed flow velocities , and hence the magnitude of @xmath37 .",
    "typically these limits imply @xmath154 and @xmath155 , i.e. the error in the update of the centre - of - mass position of two colliding bonds is less than @xmath156 .",
    "this is much smaller than any of the other typical length scales ( @xmath157 ) of the problem . in the next section",
    "a test will show that the method is indeed effectively galilean invariant for all tested flow velocities in the range @xmath158 .",
    "the ability to update the positions and check for collisions one vertex at a time makes the method efficient . also , the use of mpcd to model the solvent makes the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions relatively cheap .",
    "the precise speed of the simulation depends on the system size and chain density , where the computation rate scales approximately inversely linear with system volume and @xmath159 . in its current implementation",
    "a system containing about @xmath160 solvent particles and 100 semiflexible fibers with an aspect ratio of @xmath161 ( i.e. represented by 64 vertices each ) at a density of @xmath162 is integrated at a rate of 30 time steps ( @xmath33 ) per second on a modern single core processor . for this system one ( dilute limit )",
    "rotational relaxation time @xmath163 is reached in 75 hours . of course @xmath148 itself",
    "depends strongly on the length of the fiber . in the above example , when each 64 vertex fiber is cut into two shorter fibers of 32 vertices , using the same mesh size , the time to reach @xmath148 decreases to 11 hours of computation .",
    "the dynamics of a flexible chain or semiflexible fiber in dilute solution is strongly affected by his . to test whether the srd method indeed captures hydrodynamic interactions correctly ,",
    "i will first focus on the qualitative and quantitative behaviour of the self - diffusion coefficients of single chains or fibers @xcite . in all cases",
    "the solvent is represented by an average of @xmath109 particles per cell .",
    "the collision interval is set to @xmath108 and the collision angle to @xmath118 .",

    "the persistence length is chosen equal to twice the contour length , @xmath178 .",

    "the diameter is in good agreement with the effective hydrodynamic radius estimated for our vertices .",
    "the prefactor is slightly smaller than the theoretical prediction @xmath183 , which can again be attributed to the slowing effect of periodic images .",
    "note that in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions each vertex would act as an independent source of friction , leading to a centre - of - mass diffusion coefficient which scales like @xmath184 ( dot - dashed line ) for both flexible chains and rigid rods . from these tests",
