    "several statistical analyses , however , have questioned whether the known lmxb populations could produce the observed msps ( grindlay & bailyn 1988 , kulkarni & narayan 1988 , bailyn & grindlay 1990 , kulkarni 1995 ) .",
    "the problem of msp birth rate is briefly summarized as follows ( e.g. grindlay 1995 ) .",
    "the msp lifetime due to the electromagnetic dipole emission ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pulsar magnetic field strength and @xmath10 is the spin period . for the estimated total number of msps ( bailes & lorimer 1995 ) , @xmath11 ,",
    "the observed msps require a birth rate of @xmath12 on the msp birth rate , @xmath13 above the luminosity limit of 1 mjy kpc@xmath14",
    ". the uncertainty in this estimate could be large due to uncertainties in beaming of pulsar emission and the galactic scale height of the pulsar distribution .",
    "for a high accretion rate @xmath1 and a relatively low @xmath9 , the accretion flow extends close to the neutron star surface .",
    "then , the spin - up of a slowly rotating neutron star to the spin period of @xmath15 , would require mass accretion of at least @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the moment of inertia , @xmath18 is the mass , @xmath19 is the radius of the neutron star , and @xmath20 , respectively ( cf . bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "luminous z sources have luminosities @xmath21 close to the eddington luminosity @xmath22 and their magnetic fields are estimated to be in the range @xmath23 . the typical spin - up time scale for z sources @xmath24 . for the observed number of z sources @xmath25 , the msp birth rate from z sources",
    "is expected to be @xmath26 . for less luminous , bursting atoll sources with luminosities @xmath27 , the typical spin - up time scale @xmath28 .",
    "for the total number of atoll sources @xmath29 , the estimated birth rate is @xmath30 , which is within a factor @xmath31 of the z source rate .",
    "these rates fall short of the msp formation rate roughly by at least an order of magnitude ( cf .",

    "recent observations with rxte ( cf . summary in white and zhang 1997 ) have yielded the long - sought evidence that lmxbs ( including both z sources and burst sources ) are spun - up to @xmath32few ms spin periods as indicated by their khz qpos and the direct detection ( in a few sources ) of what appear to be underlying spin periods .",
    "some 10 sources now appear to have @xmath33 pulsation frequencies which certainly suggests that these sources have indeed spun - up and could thus evolve to msps .",
    "recently , the first direct detection of a true lmxb - msp ( saxj1808.4 - 3658 ) with a spin - period of 2.49ms has been reported ( wijnands and van der klis 1998 ) along with the value for its binary period ( @xmath322h ) , probable companion mass ( @xmath34 ) and thus likely evolution ( chakrabarty and morgan 1998 ) .",
    "however , even if all the known lmxbs are found to have similar pulsation periods , the birth rate problem summarized above still remains to be resolved .",
    "the msp formation problem could be solved if a generally unseen population of lmxbs with low luminosities spin - up to msps .",

    "this plot shows that msps form only from lmxbs with weak magnetic fields @xmath73 if @xmath74 or lmxbs with @xmath75 if @xmath76 .",
    "a system with a lower @xmath1 needs proportionally more time to spin - up to a msp than does a high @xmath1 system .",
    "the final spin period becomes the equilibrium period , which is fixed by both @xmath1 and @xmath9 , only if the system arrives at the equilibrium period on timescales for the binary not to have evolved significantly .",
    "otherwise , @xmath1 would have changed significantly , in which case a new equilibrium spin period would be sought . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the spin - up time scale is prohibitively long @xmath78 and spin - up to a msp in a time - scale less than the age of the galaxy is impossible .",
    "therefore , in the standard model , the msp formation rate problem could be solved only if there are @xmath79 persistent , low luminosity lmxbs with @xmath80 ( i.e. luminosity @xmath81 ) and magnetic fields @xmath82 ( see below for recurrent sources ) .",
    "the conclusion we have derived above may get dramatically worse due to the possible transition in accretion flows ( grindlay 1995 ) . this is because at low @xmath1 , the accretion flow is likely to take the form of a quasi - spherical , sub - keplerian rotation ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath1 falls below a critical accretion rate @xmath83 , the viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow is not efficiently radiated but kept as internal heat energy of the accreted gas . as a result , the accretion flow is heated essentially to the virial temperature and the accretion flow thickens due to the internal pressure support .",
    "the internal pressure support also causes the rotation of the quasi - spherical flow to deviate from keplerian to sub - keplerian .",
    "the sub - keplerian rotation of the accretion flow can be conveniently modeled as @xmath84 where @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the keplerian rotation ( narayan & yi 1995 , yi et al .",
    "the sub - keplerian rotation parameter @xmath87 is determined essentially by the ratio of the internal pressures @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the gas pressure and @xmath90 is the magnetic pressure from the tangled , isotropic magnetic field in equipartition with the thermal energy of the accreted plasma ; i.e. @xmath91^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath92 is the ratio of specific heats in the assumed equipartition plasma ( esin 1997 , cf .",
    "narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "a large @xmath93 ( i.e. small magnetic pressure ) would give @xmath94 whereas @xmath95 for equipartition @xmath96 .",
    "the sub - keplerian rotation parameter @xmath87 weakly depends on @xmath47 as long as @xmath97 .",
    "recently , yi et al . (",
    "1997 ) have suggested that the torque reversals seen in some x - ray pulsars could be precisely due to this accretion flow transition , which would also confirm that indeed sub - keplerian flows form probably for @xmath1 below a critical rate @xmath83 for accretion onto nss since otherwise these advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) have been derived originally ( narayan and yi 1995 ) only for accretion onto bhs . it has been demonstrated that observed reversal events are reproduced by @xmath98 when the transition occurs at @xmath99 .",
    "this supports the existence of the plasma roughly with equipartition in accretion flows around lmxbs when @xmath6 .",
    "the critical accretion rate @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the eddington accretion rate with 10% efficiency ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . for @xmath49",
    ", @xmath102 is expected .",
    "this rate could be somewhat lower than the critical rate for the adaf black hole systems , since cooling of the accretion flow is more efficient in neutron star systems due to the soft photons from the neutron star surface ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the appearance of the quasi - spherical flow is accompanied by slight luminosity changes ( yi et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) but the x - ray spectral changes appear to be significant ( vaughan & kitamoto 1997 ) .    when the accretion flow rotation becomes sub - keplerian , the corotation radius is shifted to a new location , @xmath103 ( yi et al .",

    "@xmath60 would be reached for b_*_a^7/6(/)^1/2m_16 . for @xmath108 and @xmath65 , @xmath109b_{*,8}^{6/7}$ ] , which suggests that a typical msp with @xmath110 would require @xmath111 .",
    "any lmxbs with @xmath112 can not produce the observed msps with @xmath113 .",
    "it is usually thought that neutron stars are born with larger magnetic fields and that such low magnetic fields as required ( @xmath111 ) for spinup of low luminosity lmxbs to msps must therefore result from field decay . although the exact mechanism for the field decay still remains uncertain , in a simple heuristic model , the field decays as a result of mass accretion and the strength of the magnetic field is determined by the amount of mass accreted ( e.g. taam & van den heuvel 1986 , romani 1990 ) . in this model , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is duration of accretion and @xmath116 is the characteristic mass scale for field decay .",
    "assuming that neutron stars are typically produced with field strengths @xmath117 , the spin - up of atoll sources with @xmath118 to msps requires @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( and @xmath121 yr for the sub - critical accretion case with @xmath122  g / s and @xmath111 ) .",
    "thus for the atoll source case ( with @xmath118 ) , the field decay model requires that the characteristic mass @xmath123 for @xmath124 .    however , there is now evidence against field decay ( in lmxbs ) to values below @xmath3210@xmath125 g : the newly discovered lmxb - msp saxj1808.4 - 3658 ( wijnands and van der klis 1998 ) directly shows this lmxb contains a ns with a likely magnetic field",
    "b @xmath126 g ( although these same authors speculate that perhaps the lack of detection of pulsations in other lmxbs suggests they may indeed have lower b fields ) .",
    "additional evidence against field decay ( to below 10@xmath125 g ) in even very old lmxb systems comes from the detection of khz qpos and possible pulsations ( at the qpo difference frequency of 275@xmath1278 hz ) in the relatively luminous atoll source 4u1820 - 30 in the globular cluster ngc 6624 ( smale et al .",
    "1997 , zhang et al 1998 ) . since the ns in this system is a pop ii ns , and therefore likely to have an age @xmath3210@xmath128 , and yet the khz qpos ( and possible pulsations ) in this object with @xmath129 suggest a magnetic field @xmath130 g , it appears that even continued accretion has not reduced the b field below this value .",
    "thus the required b field values of msps actually observed , the required spin - up timescales , and the lack of evidence that field decay continues below @xmath3210@xmath125 g combine to effectively rule out any persistent low luminosity sources as a possible source of msps .",
    "in fact , spin - up of atoll sources to msps also becomes questionable .",
    "this rather radical conclusion could be avoided only when @xmath131 or when @xmath132 .",
    "the former possibility is not likely ( wang 1995 , aly & kuijpers 1990 ) and the latter is not supported by the recent work ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 , yi et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .    in figure 1b",
    ", we show the spin - up lines assuming that the accretion flow becomes sub - keplerian below the assumed critical accretion rate @xmath133 with @xmath108 ( yi et al .",
    "this figure confirms our conclusion that even at a relatively high accretion rate @xmath134 , msps would be produced only when @xmath135 .",
    "for such low @xmath9 s , most of lmxbs with @xmath74 would not emerge out of the so - called pulsar graveyard below the death line ( e.g. ritchings 1976 ) during spin - up .",
    "they would be detected as msps only after arriving at periods @xmath136 ( i.e. solid lines above the the death line ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in the @xmath137 vs. @xmath9 plot , there could be a gap due to the accretion flow transition as implied by the spin - up line for the assumed @xmath138 . for @xmath139",
    "the keplerian spin - up line in figure 1a applies whereas for @xmath6 ( figure 1b ) the sub - keplerian spin - up line would be shifted discontinuously downward , leaving a region between the two lines as a gap .",
    "if there is a significant population of low luminosity lmxbs spun - up with the sub - keplerian rotation , they could produce msps above the death line typically with @xmath15 and @xmath140 .",
    "these msps would populate the region marked by the solid box in the bottom left corner in figure 1b .",
    "their intrinsic electromagnetic power is expected to be only @xmath141 , which is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than that of the typical msps and is therefore likely well below the @xmath321mjy - kpc@xmath14 radio luminosity limit of msps detected by lyne et al ( 1997 ) . it is not clear whether a significant number of such msps could be found in reality given the longer spin - up time scales ( @xmath142 ) for lower @xmath1 s .",
    "some lmxbs show low luminosities ( i.e. @xmath6 ) between recurrent outbursts ( verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) or during some periods as persistent sources ( e.g. tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) . during high @xmath1 ,",
    "the spin - up time scale and the equilibrium spin period could become considerably shorter than those of the low @xmath1 period .",
    "if the high @xmath1 and low @xmath1 periods alternate , the lmxb systems would be constantly away from their equilibrium spin periods . the typical spin - up time scale @xmath143",
    "depends on @xmath1 as @xmath144 ( //10)^1/7 m_16 ^ -6/7b_*,8 ^ -2/7p_*,1 ^ -1 where @xmath145 .",
    "this time scale applies to both the keplerian accretion disk and the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "if recurrent outbursts have @xmath1 as high as @xmath146 , the short equilibrium spin period corresponding to this high @xmath1 would be reached if the outburst phase cumulatively lasts for @xmath147 while accreting a mass of @xmath148 . since the low @xmath112 phase would have a long spin - up time scale @xmath149",
    ", the recurrent outbursts would determine the eventual spin period if the duration of the outburst is @xmath150 of the quiescent duration .",
    "for instance , for an outburst recurrence time scale @xmath151 , the required duration of outbursts is @xmath152 , which is typical of the  soft x - ray transients \" ( sxts ) containing black hole primaries ( e.g. tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "sxt systems containing neutron star primaries ( ns - sxts ) could thus in principle solve the msp formation problem .",
    "the plausibility of this channel of msp formation critically depends on actual detections of ns - sxts in sufficient numbers .",
    "presently , there is little evidence which indicates the existence of a large population of such transient sources , and in fact van paradijs ( 1996 ) has shown that among the transients bh - sxts are likely to be favored over ns - sxts . of the known ns - sxts",
    ", aql x-1 has been found in recent rxte observations ( e.g. white & zhang 1997 ) to have a @xmath153 pulsation , which could put aql x-1 as a promising msp progenitor .",
    "however , since it has a @xmath154 recurrence time scale and @xmath321 month outburst duration and so is more similar to the quasi - persistent source 4u1608 - 52 and the atoll sources , for which the birthrate problem exists , it may not represent the required class of ns - sxt progenitor .",
    "in fact only one bona - fide ns - sxt system is known : cen x-4 , which shows deep quiescence between strong outbursts every @xmath32 10 - 20 years .",
    "more detections of ns - sxts ( as discussed below ) are definitely required for them to be regarded as likely msp progenitors .",
    "recently , gotthelf and kulkarni ( 1997 ) have reported the detection of an unusual burst source in the globular cluster m28 .",
    "they attributed the unusually low burst luminosity to the low mass accretion rate onto a magnetized neutron star .",
    "the possible type i burst could occur in the magnetized accretion column which naturally increases the effective mass accretion rate and density on the stellar surface .",
    "even if such sources eventually show up in great numbers as a potentially important new class of ns - sxts , the deduced magnetic field strength ( based on the non - detection of pulsations and hence extremely slow spin ) is much too large to be compatible with the typical field strength needed for msp progenitors .",
    "we have found that low luminosity lmxbs are hard to spin - up to msps unless they have magnetic fields substantially lower ( @xmath155 g ) than those of the observed msps with b @xmath156 g. thus the lmxb phase would have to be followed by a phase of field amplification to produce the currently observed msps .",
    "even when the magnetic fields are sufficiently weak , the long spin - up time scale @xmath157 for low mass accretion rates @xmath158 poses another problem . if , as is likely for adaf models ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , the accretion flow becomes quasi - spherical and sub - keplerian for @xmath159 , it could rule out _ any _ low luminosity population and potentially a significant fraction of atoll sources as a possible source of the msps .",
    "thus we conclude that the  standard model \" for the formation of msps from lmxbs requires that they form from a larger population of normally quiescent sxt systems containing nss with b @xmath156 g. if these sources have fractional duty cycle f = 0.01 ( i.e. accrete at @xmath160 g / s for @xmath321 month every @xmath3210 yr ) , they could provide the observed msp population if their parent population is @xmath161 the observed persistent atoll source population ( since , although only @xmath162 yr is needed for spin - up , the @xmath163% duty cycle means that an effective lifetime needed is 10@xmath164 years , or the same as that for the persistent sources ) .",
    "more generally , a population of quiescent ns - sxts with peak accretion rates @xmath165 ( in units of @xmath166 g / s ) and on - time duty cycle f@xmath167 ( in units of 0.01 ) could only solve the msp birthrate problem if at any given time there are n@xmath168 10/(@xmath165f@xmath167 ) yr@xmath169 in outburst .",
    "thus there would need be @xmath3210 ns - sxts like cen x-4 ( with @xmath165 @xmath32 1 and f@xmath167 @xmath32 1 ) or @xmath32100 like aql x-1 ( with @xmath170 @xmath32 1 and f@xmath167 @xmath32 10 ) in their `` on '' state at any given time , which is clearly not consistent with observations .",
    "although the discovery of saxj1808.4 - 3658 may point to a larger population of aql x-1 type ns - sxts , the apparent rate of these new bursters discovered by rxte or bepposax thus far appears much too low : perhaps at most @xmath323 `` new '' ( recurrent ) bursters that are `` on '' at any given time .",
    "a recent example is the rxte re - discovery of the burster xtej1806 - 246 ( marshall and strohmayer 1998 ) , which is very likely the burster 2s1803 - 245 originally detected with sas-3 .",
    "thus the required large population of ns - sxts are simply not seen ( it would be comparable in number to the known number of persistent atoll sources ) , and so we conclude there is as yet no compelling evidence for msp formation from ns - sxts .",
    "a new class of msps could possibly form from an as yet undetected population of persistent , low luminosity lmxbs .",
    "these would produce a low magnetic field ( @xmath171 ) , radio weak msps with typical radio luminosities @xmath172 if the radio efficiency is @xmath173 .",
    "if the magnetic field is much weaker than @xmath174 , the msps would reside in the region below the pulsar death line , which makes the detection of these pulsars virtually impossible . if a significant number of low luminosity lmxbs spin - up to msps , they could appear as a group of radio - weak msps distinct from the known msps .",
    "given the difficulties of the `` standard model '' , even for ns - sxts , we consider finally the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) model for `` direct '' production of msps without the lmxb progenitor phase ( michel 1987 , grindlay & bailyn 1988 , bailyn & grindlay 1990 ) . in the aic scenario , white dwarfs collapse to neutron stars",
    "after reaching the critical chandrasekhar limit @xmath175 through accretion .",
    "it is believed that aic occurs for high mass accretion rates @xmath176 ( e.g. nomoto & kondo 1991 , livio & truran 1992 ) . the pre - aic magnetic field on the wd will play an important ( and poorly determined ) role in the formation of msps . for magnetic wds ( @xmath177 gauss ) and",
    "initially slowly rotating white dwarfs accreting at a rate in the range @xmath178 and assuming that the magnetic fields are flux - frozen and amplified by compression during collapse , yi & blackman ( 1997 ) have found that the magnetic field of aic - produced pulsars would be correlated with the pulsar spin as @xmath179 ( cf . narayan & popham 1989 ) where @xmath180 , @xmath181 g , and @xmath182 is a constant of order unity . in figure 1b ,",
    "the dotted line is the hypothetical birth line of strongly magnetized pulsars from aic .",
    "this correlation indicates that the field strength of pulsars with @xmath183 would be typically close to @xmath184 g , which are many orders of magnitude larger than the observed msps .",
    "unless these fields decay rapidly , or if magnetic flux is not conserved during collapse in aic ( e.g. if instead field is annihilated ) , the aic - produced msps would be very bright and lose their rotational kinetic energy at a rate @xmath185 with the characteristic emission time scale @xmath186 .",
    "such a short time scale indicates that the pulsars could evolve almost instantaneously to long @xmath10 s .",
    "they could be an abundant source of lmxbs if accretion resumes after @xmath151 of intense electromagnetic activity .",
    "these aic - produced lmxb s would produce msps similar to the observed ones only when the magnetic field somehow decays by several orders of magnitude during the lmxb phase .",
    "however , by requiring a subsequent lmxb phase , they obviously do not solve the observed lmxb vs. msp birthrate problem and so we do not consider this further ( for msp production ) .    for the case of weakly magnetized ( @xmath187 ) white dwarfs , aic could directly produce low - field msps but only if the collapse itself is not halted by rotation . to produce the observed @xmath322 ms spin periods ,",
    "the pre - aic wd must have spin period @xmath3220 s ( assuming conservation of angular momentum in the collapse from a 1.4m@xmath188 wd of radius @xmath189 km to a 10 km radius ns ) . however , for low magnetic field , these stars are not braked by the magnetic fields and so the spin period of the pre - collapse wd could instead be spun up to the minimum ( @xmath1901s ) period where collapse would be halted unless the excess angular momentum is first removed .",
    "thus for aic to be completed without producing the so - called rotationally supported  fizzlers \" , angular momentum must be efficiently removed during or before collapse ( e.g. tohlin 1984 ) .",
    "this implies that aic would produce the msps only if white dwarfs stop spinning - up despite continued accretion .",
    "thus the possibility of spin - down near the break - up period , despite continuous accretion ( popham & narayan 1991 , paczynski 1991 , bisnovatyi - kogan 1993 ) , is an intriguing possible solution to the msp birthrate problem .",
    "we conclude that if an aic process produces the bulk of the observed msps , it is necessary to shed angular momentum ( low b field wd case ) or magnetic field ( high b field wd case ) either prior to or during the collapse . since only the former process directly produces a msp without an lmxb ,",
    "it is preferred .",
    "however both processes may occur and in fact may relate the problems of msp formation with that of the origin of gamma - ray bursts , as we discuss in a forthcoming paper ( work in preparation ) .",
