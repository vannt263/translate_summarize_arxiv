    "the processes of the lepton flavor violation in the charged lepton sector ( clfv ) are the clear signature beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and they are searched for by many experiments . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with right - handed neutrinos ( mssmrn ) ,",
    "the effective clfv interactions are originated from the off - diagonal elements of the left - handed slepton mass matrix , @xmath2 @xmath3 , which are induced by the radiative corrections with neutrino yukawa interaction @xcite .",
    "the size of the clfv processes in many classes of such a model can reach the sensitivity of the forthcoming experiments .",
    "therefore , the clfv search is one of the promising experiments to find the new physics evidence .",
    "however , we here propose an alternative method to do it , the search for the processes of the lepton flavor violation with neutrinos ( nlfv ) in a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "the feasibility study on the nlfv interaction search without the specific models is made by refs.@xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that the nlfv signal is enhanced by the interference between the amplitude with the nlfv interactions and that of the standard oscillation @xcite .",
    "we here investigate the nlfv interaction in the mssmrn .",
    "since the origin of the nlfv processes is the same as that of the clfv processes and , in addition , there is an enhancement mechanism due to the interference , the detectable nlfv coupling can be expected .",
    "we show the numerical result on the size of the nlfv coupling and the correlation with the clfv process .    in the next section ,",
    "the enhancement mechanism is explained and the way to parameterize the nlfv effect in an oscillation experiment is shown .",
    "we here deal with the nlfv process , @xmath4 in @xmath1 channel at a neutrino factory . in sec.3",
    ", we evaluate numerically the size of the effective coupling for the nlfv interaction in the mssmrn .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in sec.4 .",
    "in the neutrino oscillation experiments , we only observe the charged particles which interact with the neutrino , namely , the neutrino appears only in the intermediate state . therefore",
    ", the existence of the nlfv interactions suggests that there are some amplitudes whose initial and final states are the same as the standard oscillation amplitude .",
    "let us show one example . in @xmath1 oscillation measurement at a neutrino factory , we can only know the decay of the muon at the muon storage ring and the appearance of the tau lepton at the detector .",
    "these observations are interpreted by the standard oscillation scenario as the muon decays into a muon neutrino and it oscillates to the tau neutrino and it produces a tau lepton through the charged current interaction : @xmath5 however , the same result can be reproduced by the other process which includes the nlfv interaction , the muon decays into a tau neutrino : @xmath6 the oscillation probability for @xmath1 is modified to @xmath7 + \\cdots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term comes from the interference effect , which is proportional to the nlfv coupling itself not its square .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the ratio between the coupling of the standard interaction and the nlfv interaction type nlfv interaction . ] : @xmath9 we can deal with this effect by treating the initial neutrino state ( the source state ) as the flavor mixture state @xcite : @xmath10 the other types of nlfv interaction can enter the neutrino propagation process as the exotic matter effect potential @xcite and also the neutrino detection process @xcite .",
    "they are investigated in our future work , we here concentrate our attention on the nlfv interaction at the source state .",
