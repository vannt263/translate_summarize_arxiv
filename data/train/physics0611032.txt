    "plasma is a typical complex medium exhibiting a wide variety of nonlinear phenomena such as self oscillations , chaos , intermittency etc  @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit chaotic or regular behavior depending on the controlling parameters like discharge current , voltage , pressure etc , and the transition from one state to another takes place for a change in any one of the parameters  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the observations of the chaotic and the regular behaviors in the floating potential fluctuations at different discharge voltages in a concentric cylindrical electrode system with a hollow cathode . in almost all the earlier experiments ,",
    "the system goes from order state to chaotic state , whereas in ours the reverse is seen , thus indicating signature of inverse bifurcation for the first time in a glow discharge plasma .",
    "the fluctuations are observed when a bright glow is formed around the anode .",
    "nonlinear fluctuation analysis has been carried by estimating the correlation dimension and lyapunov exponent in addition to power spectral analysis .",
    "the correlation dimension and lyapunov exponents were estimated using the grassberger - procaccia algorithm  @xcite , the rosenstein s technique algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the latter was chosen for the lyapunov exponent since it is efficient for small data lengths  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed in a hollow cathode dc glow discharge plasma . the schematic diagram is shown in fig  [ fig1:setup ] . a hollow s.s .",
    "tube of diameter ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 45 mm was the cathode and a central rod of @xmath2 1.6 mm was the anode .",
    "the whole assembly was mounted inside a vacuum chamber and was pumped down to about 0.001 mbar using a rotary pump .",
    "the chamber was filled with argon gas up to a desired value of neutral pressure , by a needle valve , and then a discharge was struck by a dc voltage ( which we called as discharge voltage or dv ) , which could be varied in the range of 0@xmath31000 v. the electrostatic floating potential fluctuations were measured using a langmuir probe of @xmath0 = 0.5 mm and 2 mm long , approximately at the mid position of the anode and the cathode . a black and white ccd camera has been used to measure the size of the anode glow . the measured plasma density and the electron temperature were about @xmath4 and 3@xmath34 ev respectively . the corresponding electron plasma frequency ( @xmath5 ) , and the ion plasma frequency ( @xmath6 ) were about 28 mhz , and 105 khz respectively .",

    ", width=8 ]",
    "by varying the neutral pressure , we observed the breakdown of the gas at different voltages as shown in fig  [ fig : paschen ] .",
    "the breakdown voltage ( @xmath7 ) initially decreases with increase in @xmath8 , ( where p and d are the filling pressure and radius of the cathode respectively ) and then begins to increase with @xmath8 after going through a minimum value resembling a typical paschen curve  @xcite .",
    "but the characteristics of the discharges are very different at low and high pressures . at higher pressures especially for @xmath9 mbar - mm an anode glow",
    "was observed as shown in fig 3 .",
    "vs @xmath8 ( paschen curve ) for our experimental system .",
    "the minimum occurs at ( 1.69 mbar - mm , 251 v).,width=8 ]        figs  [ fig : glow](a ) shows that the glow with largest size , appears when the discharge is struck at a typical pressure of 0.95 mbar and its size decreases with increase in the dv until it finally disappears [ figs  [ fig : glow](a)@xmath3[fig : glow](h ) ] . from the ccd image analysis the annular radius of the glow around the anode , was estimated to be @xmath10 mm at the beginning of the discharge [ fig  [ fig : glow](a ) ] and reduced to @xmath11 mm [ fig  [ fig : glow](f ) ] .",
    "we estimated the thickness ( @xmath12 ) using the relation  @xcite @xmath13 where k , t , @xmath14 , and p are boltzmann constant , room temperature in kelvin scale , ionization cross section and presure in mbar respectively .",
    "@xmath14 depends upon the energy of the electron and at 15.76 ev , @xmath14 is @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the estimated thickness of the anode glow for @xmath16 mbar ; @xmath17 k , is @xmath18 mm which is within the range of the thickness estimated from the image shown in fig  [ fig : glow ] .",
    "the anode glow appears when the discharge current is too low to sustain the discharge  @xcite .",
    "this glow supplies energy , in the form of positive potential gradient , to the electrons so that additional ionization takes place and hence discharge current increases  @xcite .",
    "in the present experiment , at the initial stages of discharges the electrons do not have sufficient energy near the anode to reach it , and hence the anode glow occurs .",
    "but , when the electrons have sufficient energy to reach the anode the glow disappears .     in the curve near the anode and the cathode are the extrapolation of the potential.,width=8 ]    fig  [ fig : pot](a ) and  [ fig : pot](b ) show the tentative model of floating potential profile for the present experimental arrangement .",
    "it shows that the floating potential increases sharply in the sheath region near the cathode and then decreases slowly up to the anode .",
    "as the measurement near the anode and the cathode was not possible , the extrapolated potential profile is shown by dash lines . in the the presence of the anode glow ,",
    "the potential near the anode get modified .",
    "experimentally it is observed that the anode glow is separated from rest of the plasma by a double layer  @xcite and the height of the potential of the core of this glow is of the order of the ionization potential  @xcite , which for argon is about 15.76 ev .",
    "as the anode is grounded , the modified potential profile in this case , over the profile shown in fig  [ fig : pot](a ) , will be as shown in fig  [ fig : pot](b ) . as the width of the anode glow decreases with increase in the dvs [ fig  [ fig : glow ] ] the hump shown in fig  [ fig : pot](b ) will also shrink accordingly .",
    "this shrinkage happens because as the electron energy increases with the dvs , the necessity of the additional ionization to maintain the discharge decreases .",
    "an interesting feature associated with the anode glow was the different types of oscillations in the floating potential at different pressures .",
    "the behavior of the floating potential fluctuations for pressures less than the paschen minimum , was different from that at higher pressures . at low pressures ( lhs of paschen minimum ) the fluctuations exhibited",
    "self organized criticality ( soc ) like behavior  @xcite , but at higher pressures ( rhs of the paschen minimum ) , we observed fluctuations in the floating potential with the formation of the anode glow ( fire ball , similar to ref  @xcite ) which also disappears with the disappearance of the glow [ fig  [ fig : glow ] ] .",
    "we carried out a detailed analysis of the fluctuations for three typical pressures which are presented here . at about 0.89 mbar ( @xmath19 mbar - mm ) , the discharge was initiated at @xmath20 v and an anode glow was observed similar to fig  [ fig : glow](a ) . simultaneously irregular relaxation type of oscillations in the floating potential were observed [ fig  [ fig : raw0.89mb](a ) ] .",
    "increasing the dvs , led to an increase both in the amplitude and the time period of the oscillations [ figs  [ fig : raw0.89 mb ] ( b)@xmath3[fig : raw0.89mb](i ) ] .",
    "the regularity of the oscillation also increases with the dvs .",
    "around 509 v both the anode glow and the fluctuations disappeared simultaneously . at 0.95 mbar ( @xmath21 mbar - mm ) the fluctuations",
    "are observed to be more random [ fig  [ fig : raw0.95mb](a)@xmath3(i ) ] than at 0.89 mbar . with increasing dv , the final form of the fluctuations before their disappearance was the relaxation type of oscillation as shown in figs  [ fig : raw0.95mb](h)@xmath3[fig : raw0.95mb](i ) .",
    "increasing the pressure causes more randomness in the signals as seen in fig  [ fig : raw1mb](a)@xmath3(i ) at 1.0 mbar ( @xmath22 mbar - mm ) .",
    "we observed the relaxation type of oscillations at dv @xmath23 v just before the glow an the fluctuation disappear .",
    "figs  [ fig : powspecs]\\{i } , \\{ii } and \\{iii } show the power spectrum calculated for the signals at three different experimental pressures shown in figs  [ fig : raw0.89 mb ] ,  [ fig : raw0.95 mb ] and  [ fig : raw1 mb ] respectively .",
    "a broad range of frequencies ( @xmath24 ion plasma frequency ) is observed at the initial stage of the discharge , at pressures 0.89 mbar [ fig  [ fig : powspecs]\\{i } ( a ) ] , 0.95 mbar [ fig  [ fig : powspecs]\\{ii } ( a ) ] and 1.0 mbar [ fig  [ fig : powspecs]\\{iii } ( a)@xmath3(b ) ] .",
    "the figures also show that with increasing dv , number of peaks present in the power spectrum , decreases . at higher dv i.e. at the end of the sequence of the power spectra we observed one major peak with its harmonic [ figs  [ fig : powspecs]\\{i}(f)@xmath3(i ) and",
    "iii(i ) ] or two peaks [ figs  [ fig : powspecs]\\{ii}(i ) ] just before the fluctuations cease .",
    "the power spectra clearly show that the system goes from an irregular to a more or less regular state with increasing dv .",
    "another interesting feature that has been observed for all the three pressures is that the dominant frequency i.e. the frequency which has maximum power decreases with increase in the dvs [ figs  [ fig : domifreq](a)@xmath3(c ) ] . on the contrary , in many experiments  @xcite , the dominant frequency",
    "is observed to increase with the dv .",
    "the basic difference between the present experiment and the experiments performed in ref  @xcite was in the electrode configuration and biasing arrangement . in those experiments",
    "@xcite the system was planar type is which the anode voltage was increased keeping the cathode at ground whereas ours is a cylindrical system in which we increased the negative voltage on the cathode keeping anode at ground . in those systems electrons originating at cathode get lost at the anode . in our case the electrons can undergo multiple reflections and hence increases the ionization length .",
    "the fluctuations are probably due to ion acoustic instability driven by electron beam plasma interaction and also from electron and ion trapping in the potential wells . associated with the anode glow [ fig  [ fig : pot ] ] .",
    "ions produced inside the anode glow due to collisions of the accelerated electrons across the hump with the neutrals , makes the glow unstable  @xcite , which is probably responsible for the relaxation or the random oscillations  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the frequency of these instabilities can be obtained from the ion transit time in the plasma  @xcite @xmath25 , where d is the electrode distance .",
    "the estimated ion transit frequency ( @xmath26 ) for our experimental system is @xmath27 khz which agrees well with the frequency of the relaxation oscillations of the floating potential shown in figs  [ fig : powspecs]\\{i}(f)@xmath3(i),\\{ii}(i ) and \\{iii}(i ) .",
    "the higher frequency oscillations could be due to ion acoustic instabilities since the conditions are quite conducive to excite these low frequency instabilities . in the next section we have presented nonlinear analysis of the fluctuations .",
    "the presence of relaxation oscillations have been attributed to the formation of highly nonlinear structures like double layers  @xcite .",
    "we therefore estimated the correlation dimension ( @xmath28 ) and the + ve lyapunov exponent ( @xmath29 ) of all the signals .",
    "in this experiment , it is observed that the nature of the fluctuations of the potential did not vary for almost the whole day as long as the controlling parameters are kept constant , so the analyzed signals can conveniently be taken to be stationary .",
    "the correlation dimension ( @xmath28 ) has been calculated using well - known grassberger - procaccia techniques  @xcite , where correlation sum ( c(r , m ) ) scales with scale length ( r ) as @xmath30 .",
    "a typical plot of @xmath31 vs @xmath32 has been shown in fig  [ fig : corr ] for the embedding dimension ( m ) , in the range of 2 to 10 , from which we have estimated the correlation dimension ( @xmath28 ) for a typical signal ( fig  [ fig : raw0.95mb](a ) ) at dv @xmath33 v , at 0.95 mbar .",
    "the scaling region had to be chosen carefully , since for too small scale lengths the correlation sum is heavily distorted by noise and the higher scale lengths are limited by attractor dimensions . from the above plot",
    "the correlation sum exhibits a power law behavior within a certain range of @xmath34 as shown by the vertical dotted line . @xmath31 vs @xmath32 plots are almost parallel for higher m ( i.e. @xmath35 ) and the corresponding best fit has been shown by @xmath36 line .",
    "@xmath28 vs m is also shown in the inset of fig  [ fig : corr ] .",
    "it shows that @xmath28 becomes constant at higher m and this constant value of @xmath28 is the correlation dimension of that particular signal and for all of our data @xmath37 to begin with .",
    "the @xmath28 at 0.89 , 0.95 and 1 mbar for different dvs have been shown by open circle(@xmath38 ) in figs  [ fig : cordisch](a)@xmath3[fig : cordisch](c ) respectively .",
    "it is observed that there is a decreasing tendency of @xmath28 except for some intermediate values of dv at higher pressures , where it is seen to increase and then decrease again . since @xmath28 is a measure of the complexity of the system it is likely that the system complexity increases at those intermediate dvs . in our experiment",
    "initially the system is in a complex state as @xmath28 for all the three pressures is high and decreases with increase in dvs [ fig  [ fig : cordisch](a)@xmath3(c ) ] .",
    "@xmath39 just before the system reaches stable state finally , is the indicator of the periodic state and these periodic nature are also prominent from the raw data and the power spectrum [ figs  [ fig : raw0.89 mb ] ,  [ fig : raw0.95 mb ] ,  [ fig : raw1 mb ] and fig  [ fig : powspecs]\\{i}@xmath3\\{iii } ] .",

    "though @xmath28 quantifies the complexity present in the system , it does not guarantee the presence of chaos , which is determined by @xmath29 . at 0.89 mbar",
    "initially we have a high @xmath28 [ fig  [ fig : cordisch](a ) ] , but the @xmath29 is not positive in this case , implying that the system is not in chaotic state . at higher pressures we find that in general @xmath29 is + ve @xmath42 , suggesting a low dimensional chaos .",

    "the system reaches a stable state through period subtraction [ fig  [ fig : bifur](a ) ] with increasing dv .",

    "we have employed the correlation dimension as the test statistics for this method .",
    "the surrogate data has been generated by phase shuffled method , in which the phases of the signals are randomized by shuffling the fourier phases  @xcite , and hence the power spectrum ( linear structure ) is preserved , but the nonlinear structures are destroyed  @xcite . as seen in fig  [",
    "fig : surgt](c ) the @xmath28 for the original data saturates at higher m , whereas for the surrogate data it increases with m as expected , since the surrogate data is supposed to be random in nature , and its @xmath28 should be infinite  @xcite .",
    "the saturation of @xmath28 in our case indicates that the system dynamics is deterministic in nature .",
    "glow discharges are simple systems but exhibit exotic features depending on the configuration , initial parameters etc . since various configurations are used in different applications like dusty plasma , plasma processing etc .",
    "it is necessary to understand the plasma dynamics of the these systems as much as possible .",
    "however the understanding of the complexities in the plasma dynamics is quite a challenging job as they arise from many degrees of freedom like different sources of free energy , different types of wave particle interaction and many other instabilities . in our present work",
    "nonlinear time series analysis has been used to quantify and differentiate complex and coherent processes at different parametric conditions .",
    "we also observed that the chaotic state driven by a driving force ( dv ) tends to be stabilized by some type of inverse bifurcation .",
    "this is also evident from the estimated @xmath28 and @xmath29 at different dvs .",
    "it is not fully understood as to why relaxation oscillations are being observed only at 0.89 mbar and not at 0.95 and 1.0 mar though there is not much difference in the three pressures .",
    "one probably has to carry out a detailed simulation to investigate the evolution of the fluctuations at different discharge voltages .",
