    "* driver ( 2012b ) ) and provides some indication of gamas emerging status amongst established leading surveys from the past three decades .",
    "modern surveys like gama , boss and vipers are all expected to rise rapidly up this league table over the coming years and updates will be reported annually .",
    ".major extragalactic optical / near - ir surveys and their impact in terms of refereed papers and citations [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note these numbers were determined on @xmath10 dec 2012 using the soa / nasa ads astronomy query form by searching for refereed papers which contained abstract keywords based on the following boolean logic : ( galaxy or galaxies ) and ( `` @xmath11long survey name@xmath12 '' or @xmath11short survey name@xmath12 ) .",
    "the table is purely indicative and not weighted by survey age or effective cost and is updated on an annual basis .",
    "my apologies in advance for the many surveys not included .",
    ", width=384,height=528 ]",
    "as stated earlier a number of major imaging surveys are underway on a variety of internationally leading facilities which include within their survey footprints the gama sky regions .",
    "these complimentary imaging surveys are a mixture of gama motivated / led programs ( e.g. , galex , gmrt ) , those in which gama team members are playing a leading role ( e.g. , vista viking , askap dingo ) , to those in which gama is peripheral or playing a supporting role ( e.g. , vst kids , wise , herschel - atlas ) .",
    "regardless of the motivation these data collectively form the gama panchromatic campaign and need to be assembled , astrometrically matched , and for photometric measurements to be conducted which manages highly variable flux limits and spatial resolutions .",
    "typically only 10 - 20% of the gama galaxies have clear unambiguous counterparts in all bands and spatial resolutions which vary with wavelength from 0.5@xmath13 to 30@xmath13 .",
    "the significance of managing these two issues ( flux limits and spatial resolutions ) , can not be overstated . the correct strategy to manage this process",
    "is not yet entirely clear , the wrong strategy however is . to simply conduct independent source finding in each band and then attempt to table match the resulting catalogues leads to a highly biased ( ill defined ) sample with high levels of blended contamination in the poorer resolution bands .",
    "the problem is particularly acute when matching data from the optical to the far - ir where the incidence of high - z interlopers and lensed sources becomes a significant problem .",
    "[ fig1 ] highlights some of these issues by showing the assembled data for a single object which is clearly detected and unambiguous but also highlights the varying spatial resolution across the wavebands sampled .",
    "the red curve on fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the simple best - sed fit to these data from the magphys energy balance software of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* da cunha , charlot & elbaz ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the blue curve shows the actual energy production within this galaxy .",
    "in particular it is worth noting the significant change in the slope of the sed in the blue optical region where the observed colour is often erroneously used to divide the galaxy population into _ intrinsically _ red and blue populations . indeed",
    "this object is observationally red with a high - srsic index yet also dusty and star - forming ( i.e. , _ intrinsically _ blue ) .",
    "this system alone highlights that galaxies do not simply come in two flavours but are a medley of intermingled parameters with all possibilities existing in colour / star - formation / profile - shape / opacity / halo / stellar mass parameter space . in order to complete this analysis not only are broad spectrum measurements vital but in the case of non - detections robust upper limits with meaningful errors .",
    "this demands the definition of the sample in a single band from which measurements / upper - limits are garnered across the full electro - magnetic range .",
    "a key question is which band to start from , possibly the most logical is that most closely aligned to stellar mass , i.e. , @xmath14 or @xmath15 band .",
    "unlocking the interdependency of galaxy properties as a function of environment and redshift requires a comprehensive panchromatic survey such as gama .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the type of data we are now assembling for 380,000 galaxies which will enable us to move beyond simple two - dimensional descriptions of the galaxy population and allow us to explore the rich interdependencies of the many properties which we will measure .",
    "extensions to fainter flux - limits , higher spatial resolutions , and higher redshifts are underway .",

    "<S> the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ) has now been operating for almost 5 years gathering spectroscopic redshifts for five regions of sky spanning 300 sq degrees in total to a depth of @xmath0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the survey has amassed over 225,000 redshifts making it the third largest redshift campaign after the sdss and boss surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the survey has two novel features that set it apart : ( 1 ) complete and uniform sampling to a fixed flux limit ( @xmath0 mag ) regardless of galaxy clustering due to multiple - visits to each sky region , enabling the construction of high - fidelity catalogues of groups and pairs , ( 2 ) co - ordination with diverse imaging campaigns which together sample an extremely broad range along the electro - magnetic spectrum from the uv ( galex ) through optical ( vst kids ) , near - ir ( vista viking ) , mid - ir ( wise ) , far - ir ( herschel - atlas ) , 1 m ( gmrt ) , and eventually 20 cm continuum and rest - frame 21 cm line measurements ( askap dingo ) . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the askap campaign all multi - wavelength programmes are either complete or in the final stages of observations and the uv - far - ir data are expected to be fully merged by the end of 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> this article provides a brief flavour of the coming panchromatic database which will eventually include measurements or upper - limits across 27 wavebands for 380,000 galaxies . </S>",
