    "<S> the principle of energy conservation leads to a generalized choice of transition probability in a piecewise adiabatic representation of quantum(-classical ) dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> significant improvement ( almost an order of magnitude , depending on the parameters of the calculation ) over previous schemes is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> novel perspectives for theoretical calculations in coherent many - body systems are opened .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of theoretical methods for the calculation of time - dependent quantum properties can not be emphasized enough . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of general algorithms , so reliable as classical molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite , is to be contrasted with the manifold of open problems that scientists face both in condensed matter  @xcite and quantum information technology  @xcite . lately </S>",
    "<S> , we are also witnessing a renaissance of quantum approaches to biological phenomena  @xcite : a revival of interest generated by the combination of methodologies from open quantum systems  @xcite and quantum information theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> undoubtedly , the possibility of performing long - time quantum dynamical simulations would be an asset for all the above fields .    </S>",
    "<S> when considering the calculation of time - dependent quantum properties , two main methods are available : time - dependent density functional theory  @xcite and quantum - classical formalisms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent density functional methods are usually limited to linear response while quantum - classical methods are restricted to perturbations around the adiabatic evolution , i.e. , nonadiabatic corrections , of few relevant quantum degrees of freedom interacting with a classical bath . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , quantum - classical methods promise to access the investigation of properties relevant to biological systems@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we are considering the formulation of quantum - classical theory by means of algebraic brackets which was proposed originally in  @xcite and shown to arise from a linear approximation of the partially wigner transformed quantum commutator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that , when the environmental degrees of freedom are harmonic and the coupling to the quantum subsystem is linear in the bath degrees of freedom , as in gauge theory  @xcite , such theory becomes fully quantum . </S>",
    "<S> what is interesting from a computational point of view is that , within such a theory , a particular approximation ( called _ momentum - jump _ in the adiabatic basis of the total system ) leads to represent nonadiabatic dynamics in terms of piecewise ( adiabatic ) deterministic trajectories interspersed by stochastic quantum transitions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a long history of development and methods for treating non - adiabatic transitions with so called surface - hopping schemes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such schemes were originated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more recent approach can be found in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are successful for the description of the dynamics but do not easily lead to an accurate formulation of the statistical mechanics of quantum - classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the theory stemming from  @xcite allows one to address the consistent formulation of the quantum - classical statistical mechanics  @xcite of general hybrid systems , i.e. , the theory can describe , in the non relativistic limit , _ any _ quantum subsystem coupled to a classical bath . </S>",
    "<S> it exactly conserves the energy of the total system and consistently describes the coupling between the quantum subsystem and the classical bath ( or the quantum harmonic bath represented in wigner phase space ) . </S>",
    "<S> the forms of the equations in the momentum - jump approximation also naturally provide a sampling transition probability for nonadiabatic change of state . </S>",
    "<S> however , when nonadiabatic effects are included , the phase space trajectories representing the quantum(-classical ) dynamics do no longer conserve the energy . despite this , in its original formulation , called sequential time - step propagation  @xcite , the algorithm is successful , although limited to somewhat short - times because of numerical instabilities arising from the sampling of the nonadiabatic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the instability , in practice , restricts the range of applications of the method to charge transfers and rate processes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more general quantum processes require the ability of sampling at longer time . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show how to achieve this by means of a suitable generalization ( implementing the principle of energy conservation ) of the transition probability in the sequential time - step propagation : this is the main theoretical idea we propose and it is introduced by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump ] ) in the following . before providing our solution </S>",
    "<S> , we sketch the theory and the original version of the sequential time - step propagation , which will be referred to in the following as _ primitive _ algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the interested reader will find more details in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of quantum - classical dynamics is defined by the equation  @xcite @xmath0 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1+\\frac{i\\hbar}{2}\\overleftarrow{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\partial$}}\\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\cal b$}^c\\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\partial$ } } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> -1-\\frac{i\\hbar}{2}\\overleftarrow{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\partial$}}\\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\cal b$}^c\\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\partial$ } } & 0 \\end{array}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot & \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{h}_w \\\\ \\hat{\\chi}_w\\end{array}\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : whqc - bracket}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a quantum operator in a partial wigner representation depending on the phase space point @xmath2 , comprised by coordinated and momenta respectively ; @xmath3 is the partially wigner - transformed hamiltonian operator of the total system , @xmath4 is the symplectic matrix , and @xmath5 stands for the phase space gradient @xmath6 , with the arrow giving the direction of action of the operators . without loss of generality , one can assume the form of the hamiltonian to be @xmath7 in the adiabatic basis , defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath8 the quantum - classical evolution reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal operator @xmath11 is defined in terms of the quantum adiabatic frequency @xmath12 and of the classical - like liouville operator @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the hellmann - feynman forces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath15 is purely off - diagonal and its action realizes the quantum nonadiabatic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth remarking that eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : whqc - bracket ] ) and  ( [ eq : qc - evol ] ) exactly conserve the total hamiltonian of the system @xmath16 .    in the momentum - jump approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the form of the off - diagonal operator @xmath15 is simplified  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we denote such an approximation by @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath17 changes the quantum state and rescales the bath momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the technical details can be found , among many other possible references , in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the momentum - jump operator , one can also define a momentum - jump liouville operator , @xmath18 , approximating the exact operator @xmath19 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qc - evol ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> deterministic dynamics is too - complicated to be solved , so one has to resort to stochastic schemes . </S>",
    "<S> a very elegant approach is provided by the sequential short time propagation  @xcite ( the primitive algorithm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is summarized as follows . for a small time step @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> the quantum - classical propagator is approximated as @xmath21 one can prove that the concatenation of short time steps , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sstp ] ) , reproduces exactly the dyson integral expansion of the operator @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm unfolds by considering the action of @xmath23 dictated by a stochastic process with a certain transition probability . </S>",
    "<S> the form of @xmath23 naturally suggests the following _ primitive _ choice of the transition probability ( for example considering the @xmath24 quantum transition ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the coupling vector . </S>",
    "<S> normalization fixes the probability of not making any transition in the time interval @xmath20 as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic propagation amounts to deterministic trajectory segments , propagating on single or mean energy surfaces , interspersed by transitions between energy surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions break the conservation of energy along the single trajectory : the conservation is only satisfied in an averaged sense in the ensemble . as one can see from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump0 ] ) , arbitrary shifted momenta @xmath28 can arise from a sampled transition . </S>",
    "<S> as experience has shown , this leads in general to very big denominators in the left hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this denominators get multiplied with each other along the trajectory to give its overall weight in the stochastic ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the concatenation of big weights arising from nonadiabatic transitions produces a numerical instability which has so far limited the application of the primitive algorithm to somewhat short times .    </S>",
    "<S> the principle of energy conservation , which is exactly satisfied by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : whqc - bracket ] ) , guides us in defining a generalized transition probability as @xmath29 where we have defined @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> again , normalization provides @xmath31 . upon introducing the variation of energy in any quantum transition @xmath32 , the generalized weight introduced in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump ] ) is defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 tunable constants controlling the numerical error on the energy conservation .    the generalized transition probability in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump ] ) and the energy - conserving weight in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eweight ] ) are our fundamental findings , improving the primitive algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> because of our choice of @xmath35 , the sampled transitions can only allow shifted momenta @xmath28 which conserve ( within the required numerical error specified by @xmath34 ) the energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn avoids arbitrarily big denominators in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump ] ) and dramatically improves the stability of the algorithm .        </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the primitive ( @xmath36 ) and energy - conserving ( @xmath37 ) sampling for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation with the primitive algorithm are propagated until @xmath41 and then stopped since already around @xmath42 the statistical error becomes very big , as the error bars show . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation with the energy - conserving sampling ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath43 , can be extended further than @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ]    in order to illustrate the efficiency of the energy - conserving sampling , we performed a series of calculation on the dynamics of the spin - boson model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the partially wigner transformed hamiltonian of this model ( in scaled coordinates ) is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the pauli matrices , @xmath48 are coordinates and momenta of @xmath49 harmonic degrees of freedom ( in the following we have used @xmath50 , @xmath51 are coupling constants defined in term of the kondo parameter @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> details of the model and definition of coordinates and parameters can be found in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] illustrate the numerical comparison between the primitive and our energy - conserving sampling for the relaxation dynamics of @xmath53 for various couplings , temperatures , and tunnel splitting @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained with the primitive algorithm are displayed by white triangles while those obtained with our energy - conserving sampling by black filled circles . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig1 ] displays the results of the numerical calculation for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> basically , after @xmath42 ( in dimensionless units ) the error bars on the primitive algorithm results grow exponentially fast and the calculation is stopped at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the calculation with our generalized sampling scheme can be extended further than @xmath44 : for this set of parameters we obtain an improvement over the time interval we can sample of at least two . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig2 ] displays the results of the numerical calculation for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . this time , the statistical errors of the primitive algorithm start growing fast around @xmath58 , while our scheme can reach further than @xmath59 , providing an improvement of an order of magnitude . summarizing , the simulation shows that the use of our energy - conserving sampling dramatically improves the stability of the elegant sequential time step algorithm at long time .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth mentioning that the approach , embodied by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : prob - jump ] ) , to modify the transition probability in order to respect a conservation law and improving the stability is very general : it is by no means restricted to quantum(-classical ) dynamics in the partial wigner representation . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> there are reasonable expectations that the generalized scheme that we have presented here can be applied , after suitable changes , to other stochastic approaches for calculating time - dependent properties , both in the classical and quantum cases . </S>"
