    "2001 ) compared to the value , log  n@xmath66 , determined from ly@xmath1 profile fitting ( weymann et al .",
    "this large change in n@xmath29 arose because the curve of growth gave a doppler parameter @xmath67 km  s@xmath7 , while ly@xmath1 profile fitting gave @xmath68 km  s@xmath7 .      determining the intergalactic heavy - element abundance ( metallicity ) of ionization state ( @xmath69 ) of element ( @xmath70 ) depends in the first instance on measuring accurate column densities , n@xmath29 and n@xmath71 .",
