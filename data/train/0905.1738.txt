    "we consider a problem of ranking large interconnected information ( data ) sets , e.g. , ranking pages on the world wide web ( web ) . a solution to the preceding problem",
    "is given by google s pagerank algorithm , the details of which are presented in section  [ ss : pr ] . given the large scale of these information sets , we adopt a stochastic approach to the page ranking problem , e.g. google s pagerank algorithm .",
    "the stochastic formulation naturally results in an equation of the form @xmath13 where @xmath1 are independent non - negative random variables , @xmath14 , @xmath2 are identically distributed , and @xmath3 are independent copies of @xmath4 ; @xmath5 stands for equality in distribution .",
    "we study the asymptotic properties of the distribution of @xmath4 that , in the context of pagerank , represents the frequencies of highly ranked pages . in somewhat smaller generality ,",
    "the preceding stochastic setup was first introduced and analyzed in @xcite for the pagerank algorithm ; the formulation given in was later studied in @xcite .",
    "the canonical representation given by recursion is also of independent interest since it belongs to a more general class of weighted branching processes ( wbps ) @xcite ; the connection to wbps is discussed in more detail in section  [ ss.relatedprocesses ] . with a small abuse of notation , we also refer to our more restrictive processes as wbps .",
    "these processes have been found useful in the average - case analysis of many algorithms @xcite , e.g. quicksort algorithm @xcite , and thus , our study of recursion ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) may be useful in these types of applications .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath15 , the steady state solution to ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) represents the total number of individuals born in an ordinary branching process . also , by letting @xmath9 be a poisson random variable and fixing @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) reduces to the recursion that is satisfied by the busy period of an m / g/1 queue .",
    "similarly , selecting @xmath17 yields the fixed point equation satisfied by the first order autoregressive process ; see section  [ ss.relatedprocesses ] for a more thorough discussion on related processes .    in section  [ s.modeldescription ]",
    "we connect the iterations of recursion to an explicit construction of a wbp on a tree , such that the sum of all the weights of the first @xmath18 generations of the tree are directly related to the @xmath18th iteration of the recursion .",
    "then , in section [ s.moments ] we present explicit estimates for the moments of the total weight , @xmath19 , of the @xmath18th generation in the corresponding wbp . using these moment estimates and the wbp representation ,",
    "we show in section  [ ss.convergence ] that under mild conditions the iterations of converge in distribution to a unique and finite steady state random variable @xmath4 .",
    "hence , under the stated assumptions , this limiting distribution @xmath20 is the unique solution to ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) .",
    "the steady state variable @xmath4 represents the sum of all the weights in the corresponding branching tree .",
    "studying the asymptotic tail properties of the constructed steady state solution @xmath4 to ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) represents the main focus of this paper .",
    "in particular , we study the possible causes that can result in power tail asymptotics for @xmath21 .",
    "we discover that the tail behavior of @xmath4 can be determined / dominated by the statistical properties of any of the three variables @xmath22 and @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in sections   [ s.c_dominates ] , [ s.ndominates ] and [ s.qdominates ] , respectively .",
    "our emphasis on power law asymptotics is motivated by the well established empirical fact that the number of pages that point to a specific page ( in - degree ) on the web , represented by @xmath9 in recursion ( [ eq : generalpr ] ) , follows a power law distribution ; other complex data sets , e.g. citations , are found to posses similar power law properties as well .",
    "our first main result on the tail behavior of @xmath23 is presented in theorem  [ t.goldieapplication ] , showing that if @xmath6=1 , \\alpha > 0 $ ] and @xmath7 satisfy additional moment conditions , then @xmath4 has a power law distribution of index @xmath8 , with an explicitly characterized constant of proportionality . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath8 is an integer , the constant of proportionality of the power law distribution is explicitly computable , see corollary  [ c.explicit ] .",
    "this result is obtained by an extension of goldie s ( 1991 ) implicit renewal theorem that we present in theorem  [ t.goldie ] .",
    "this extension may be of independent interest since @xmath4 and @xmath24 in the statement of theorem  [ t.goldie ] can be any two independent random variables that may satisfy a different recursion . in the context of the broader literature on wbps ,",
    "our results are related to the studies in @xcite ( see theorem 6 ) , and more recently in @xcite , both of which study recursion using stable law methods when @xmath12 , @xmath25 are deterministic constants .",
    "however , these deterministic assumptions fall outside of the scope of this paper ; for more details see the discussion in section [ ss.relatedprocesses ] and the remarks after theorem [ t.goldieapplication ] . outside of these results",
    ", the majority of the work on wbps considers the homogeneous equation ( @xmath26 ) , e.g. in @xcite the behavior of the distribution of @xmath4 was characterized using stable - law distributions for @xmath27 .",
    "also , related results for the homogeneous case ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath28 can be found in theorem 2.2 of @xcite and proposition 7 of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our approach for the nonhomogeneous case ( @xmath29 ) shows that the distribution of @xmath4 can have a uniform treatment for any @xmath30 . for additional comments on results related to our theorem  [ t.goldieapplication ]",
    "see the remarks following its statement .",
    "furthermore , this result may provide a new explanation of why power laws are so commonly found in the distribution of wealth since weighted branching processes appear to be reasonable models for the total wealth of a family tree .",
    "section [ s.ndominates ] studies the case when @xmath9 is power law and dominates the tail behavior of @xmath4 .",
    "this is the case that more closely relates to the original formulation of pagerank and the structure of the web graph since the in - degree @xmath9 is well accepted to be a power law . our main result in this case , stated in theorem  [ t.main_n ] , shows that , when @xmath9 is regularly varying of index @xmath10 , @xmath6<1 $ ] and @xmath11 have higher moments than @xmath8 , then the distribution of @xmath4 is tail equivalent to that of @xmath9 .",
    "our approach in deriving this result is based on a new sample path heavy - tailed large deviation method for weighted recursions on trees .",
    "the key technical result is given by proposition  [ p.uniformbound ] that provides a uniform bound ( in @xmath18 and @xmath31 ) on the distribution of the total weight of the @xmath18th generation @xmath32 .",
    "we would also like to point out that proposition  [ p.uniformbound ] resembles to some extent a classical result by kesten ( see lemma  7 on p.  149 of @xcite ) , which provides a uniform bound for the sum of heavy - tailed ( subexponential ) random variables .",
    "the main difference between the latter result and our uniform bound is that @xmath18 refers to the depth of the recursion in our case , while in lemma  7 of @xcite , @xmath18 is the number of terms in the sum .",
    "this makes the derivation of proposition  [ p.uniformbound ] considerably more complicated , and perhaps implausible , if it were not for the fact that we restrict our attention to regularly varying distributions , as opposed to the general subexponential class .",
    "section [ s.qdominates ] investigates a third possible source of heavy tails for @xmath4 , the one that arises from the innovation , @xmath12 , being power law ; see theorem  [ t.mainq ] . for @xmath17 ,",
    "this result is consistent with a corresponding result for the first order autoregressive process in lemma a.3 of @xcite .",
    "the proofs of more technical results are postponed to section  [ s.proofs ] .    finally , from a mathematical perspective",
    ", we would like to emphasize that our sample path large deviation approach as well as the extension of the implicit renewal theory , provide a new set of tools that can be of potential use in other applications , as well as in studying the broader class of recursions on trees , e.g. , one can readily characterize the asymptotic behavior of the distribution that solves @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , from an engineering perspective , our theorem  [ t.main_n ] shows that for highly ranked pages , the pagerank algorithm basically reflects the popularity vote given by the number of references @xmath9 , implying that overly inflated referencing may be advantageous",
    ". a more detailed discussion on the engineering implications of the performance and design of ranking algorithms , e.g. pagerank , can be found at the end of section  [ s.ndominates ] .",
    "pagerank is an algorithm trademarked by google , the web search engine , to assign to each page a numerical weight that measures its relative importance with respect to other pages .",
    "we think of the web as a very large interconnected graph where nodes correspond to pages .",
    "the google trademarked algorithm pagerank defines the page rank as : @xmath34 where , using google s notation , @xmath35 are the pages under consideration , @xmath36 is the set of pages that link to @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the number of outbound links on page @xmath39 , @xmath18 is the total number of pages on the web , and @xmath40 is a damping factor , usually @xmath41 . as noted in the original paper by brin and page ( 1998 ) @xcite pagerank",
    " can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm , and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web .",
    "also , a pagerank for 26 million web pages can be computed in a few hours on a medium size workstation . \"",
    "other link - based ranking algorithms for web pages include the hits algorithm , developed by kleinberg @xcite , and the trustrank algorithm @xcite .",
    "while in principle the solution to reduces to the solution of a large system ( possibly billions ) of linear equations , we believe that finding page ranks in such a way is unlikely to be insightful . specifically , if one obtains the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix , it is hard to obtain from the solution qualitative insights about the relationship between highly ranked pages and the in - degree / out - degree statistical properties of the graph .    in particular , the division by the out - degree , @xmath38 in equation , was meant to decrease the contribution of pages with highly inflated referencing , i.e. , those pages that basically point / reference possibly indiscriminately to other documents .",
    "however , the stochastic approach ( to be described in the following sections ) reveals that highly ranked pages are essentially insensitive to the parameters of the out - degree distribution , implying that the pagerank algorithm may not reduce the effects of overly inflated referencing ( citations , voting ) as originally intended , i.e. , it may lead to possibly unjustifiable highly ranked pages .",
    "an analytical explanation as to why the tail of the rank distribution is dominated by @xmath9 was first given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more discussions on this topic are provided at the end of section  [ s.ndominates ] .",
    "a stochastic approach to analyze is to consider the recursion @xmath42 where @xmath43 are constants , @xmath44 < 1 $ ] , @xmath9 is a random variable independent of the @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s , the @xmath46 s are iid random variables satisfying @xmath47 , and the @xmath45 s are iid random variables having the same distribution as @xmath4 . in terms of recursion",
    ", @xmath4 is the rank of a random page , @xmath9 corresponds to the in - degree of that node , the @xmath45 s are the ranks of the pages pointing to it , and the @xmath46 s correspond to the out - degrees of each of these pages .",
    "the experimental justification of these independence assumptions can be found in @xcite .",
    "this stochastic setup was first introduced in @xcite , where the process resulting after a finite number of iterations of was analyzed .",
    "more recently , in a follow up paper @xcite , the more general recursion @xmath48 was analyzed via tauberian theorems for the cases when @xmath9 or @xmath12 dominate . in @xcite ,",
    "dependancy between @xmath9 and @xmath12 is allowed , but additional moment conditions are imposed .",
    "recall that in the setup considered here @xmath1 are independent non - negative random variables , @xmath14 , @xmath2 are identically distributed , and @xmath3 are independent copies of @xmath4 .",
    "as outlined above , we study the sequence of random variables that are obtained by iterating .",
    "specifically , we consider for @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 are iid copies of @xmath52 from the previous iteration , and @xmath53 are mutually independent iid sequences of random variables ; for @xmath54 , @xmath55 are iid copies of the initial value @xmath56 .    in this section",
    "we will discuss the weak convergence of @xmath52 to a finite random variable @xmath4 , independently of the initial condition @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , @xmath4 is the unique solution to under the assumptions of lemma  [ l.convergence ] . in particular",
    ", we will construct a process @xmath57 on a tree that converges a.s . to @xmath4 .",
    "these convergence results may be of practical interest as well since ranking algorithms are implemented recursively .",
    "the actual proofs are postponed until section  [ ss.convergence ] .      to better understand the dynamics of our recursion , we give below a sample path construction of the random variable @xmath4 on a tree .",
    "first we construct a random tree @xmath58 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath59 to denote the root node of @xmath58 , and @xmath60 , @xmath49 , to denote the set of all individuals in the @xmath18th generation of @xmath58 , @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the number of individuals in the @xmath18th generation , that is , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the cardinality of a set ; in particular , @xmath65 .",
    "we iteratively construct the tree as follows .",

    "understanding the asymptotic properties of the distribution of @xmath4 , as defined by , is the main objective of this paper .      as we mentioned earlier , the stochastic equation defined in leads to the analysis of a process known in the literature as a weighted branching process ( wbp ) .",
    "wbps were introduced by rsler @xcite in a construction that is more general than ours .",
    "more precisely , each individual in the tree has potentially an infinite number of offsprings , and each offspring inherits a certain ( nonnegative ) weight from its parent and multiplies it by a factor @xmath136 , where the index @xmath129 refers to his birth order ( i.e. , a first born multiplies his inheritance by @xmath137 , a second born by @xmath138 , etc . ) . each individual branches independently , using an independent copy of the sequence @xmath139 .",
    "however , within the sequence , @xmath139 can be dependent .",
    "only individuals whose weights are different than zero are considered to be alive .",
    "the construction we give in this paper would correspond to having @xmath140 the definition of a wbp described above leads to the following stochastic recursion for the total weight of the @xmath18th generation , @xmath141 and a corresponding nonhomogeneous fixed point equation of the form @xmath142 in the construction given in @xcite , the @xmath143 and @xmath12 are allowed to be dependent as well .",
