    "we distinguish in the following the so called _ inclusive _ and _ exclusive _ models for diffraction .",
    "we call exclusive models the models where almost the full energy available in the center of mass is used to produce the heavy object ( dijets , higgs , diphoton , @xmath0 ... ) . in other words , we get in the final state the diffractive protons ( which can be detected in roman pot detectors ) and the heavy state which decays in the main detector .",
    "the inclusive diffraction corresponds to events where only part of the available energy is used to produce the heavy object diffractively . for this model",
    ", we assume the pomeron is made of quarks and gluons ( we take the gluon and quark densities from the hera measurements in shape and the normalisation from tevatron data ) , and a quark or a gluon from the pomeron is used to produce the heavy state .",
    "thus the exclusive model appears to be the limit where the gluon in the pomeron is a @xmath1 distribution in this framework or in other words , there is no pomeron remnants in exclusive events .",
    "we will see in the following that this distinction is quite relevant for experimental applications .",
    "let us first introduce the model @xcite we shall use for describing exclusive production . in @xcite ,",
    "the diffractive mechanism is based on two - gluon exchange between the two incoming protons .",
    "the soft pomeron is seen as a pair of gluons non - perturbatively coupled to the proton .",
    "one of the gluons is then coupled perturbatively to the hard process while the other one plays the rle of a soft screening of colour , allowing for diffraction to occur .",
    "we will give here the formulae for either the susy higgs boson , or the @xmath2 pairs production and other formulae for standard model higgs bosons , @xmath3 , diphoton or dijet production can be found in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross - sections for higgs bosons and @xmath2 production read :    @xmath4    where , in both equations , the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote respectively the transverse momenta and fractional momentum losses of the outgoing protons . in the second equation , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the squark transverse momenta and rapidities .",
    "@xmath9 are the hard production cross - sections which are given later on .",
    "the model normalisation constants @xmath10 are fixed from the fit to dijet diffractive production @xcite , while the ratio is fixed theoretically @xcite .    in the model",
    ", the soft pomeron trajectory is taken from the standard donnachie - landshoff parametrisation @xcite , namely @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 are kept as in the original paper @xcite for the sm higgs and @xmath15 pairs .",
    "note that , in this model , the strong ( non perturbative ) coupling constant is fixed to a reference value @xmath16 which will be taken from the fit to the observed centrally produced diffractive dijets .    in order to select exclusive diffractive states ,",
    "it is required to take into account the corrections from soft hadronic scattering .",
    "indeed , the soft scattering between incident particles tends to mask the genuine hard diffractive interactions at hadronic colliders .",
    "the formulation of this correction @xcite to the scattering amplitudes consists in considering a gap survival probability .",
    "the correction factor is commonly evaluated to be of order @xmath17 for the qcd exclusive diffractive processes at the lhc .",
    "more details about the theoretical model and its phenomenological applications can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the bialas landshoff model for exclusive higgs production recently implemented in a monte - carlo generator @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the inclusive models .",
    "we first notice that both models are related , since they are both based on the bialas landshoff formalism . the main difference , as we already mentionned , is that the exclusive model is a limit of the inclusive model where the full energy available is used in the interaction .",
    "the inclusive models implies the knowledge of the gluon and quark densities in the pomeron . whereas exclusive events are still to be observed , inclusive diffraction has been studied already in detail at ua8 and then at hera and tevatron .",
    "the inclusive mechanism is based on the idea that a pomeron is a composite system , made itself from quarks and gluons . in our model , we thus apply the concept of pomeron structure functions to compute the inclusive diffractive higgs boson cross - section .",
    "the h1 measurement of the diffractive structure function @xcite and the corresponding quark and gluon densities are used for this purpose .",
    "this implies the existence of pomeron remnants and qcd radiation , as is the case for the proton .",
    "this assumption comes from _ qcd factorisation _ of hard processes .",
    "however , and this is also an important issue , we do not assume _ regge factorisation _ at the proton vertices , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not use the h1 pomeron flux factors in the proton or antiproton .",
    "regge factorisation is known to be violated between hera and the tevatron .",
    "moreover , we want to use the same physical idea as in the exclusive model @xcite , namely that a non perturbative gluon exchange describes the soft interaction between the incident particles . in practice",
    ", the regge factorisation breaking appears in three ways in our model :    * i ) * we keep as in the original model of ref @xcite the soft pomeron trajectory with an intercept value of 1.08 .",
    "* ii ) * we normalize our predictions to the cdf run i measurements , allowing for factorisation breaking of the pomeron flux factors in the normalisation between the hera and hadron colliders .    *",
    "iii ) * the color factor derives from the non - factorizable character of the model , since it stems from the gluon exchange between the incident hadrons .",
    "we will see later the difference between this and the factorizable case .",
    "the formulae for the inclusive production processes considered here follow .",
    "we have , for dijet production , considering only the dominant gluon - initiated hard processes :    @xmath18    and for higgs boson production :    @xmath19    in the above , the @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) are the pomeron gluon ( resp .",
    "quark ) densities , and @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) are the pomeron s momentum fractions carried by the gluons ( resp .",
    "quarks ) involved in the hard process .",
    "we use as parametrizations of the pomeron structure functions the fits to the diffractive hera data performed in @xcite .",
    "additional formulae concerning for instance inclusive diffractive production of dileptons or diphotons are given in @xcite .",
    "both the inclusive and exclusive productions have been implemented in a generator called dpemc , which has been interfaced with a fast simulation of the d  , cdf , atlas and cms detectors .",
    "in this section , we discuss mainly the parameters which we use to simulate the detectors at the lhc",
    ". the simulation will be valid for both cms and atlas detectors .",
    "the analysis is based on a fast simulation of the cms detector at the lhc .",
    "the calorimetric coverage of the cms experiment ranges up to a pseudorapidity of @xmath24 .",
    "the region devoted to precision measurements lies within @xmath25 , with a typical resolution on jet energy measurement of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is in gev , and a granularity in pseudorapidity and azimuth of @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to the central cms detector , the existence of roman pot detectors allowing to tag diffractively produced protons , located on both @xmath29 sides , is assumed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 acceptance and resolution have been derived for each device using a complete simulation of the lhc beam parameters .",
    "the combined @xmath30 acceptance is @xmath31 for @xmath30 ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , where @xmath30 is the proton fractional momentum loss .",
    "the acceptance limit of the device closest to the interaction point is @xmath340.02 .    in exclusive double pomeron exchange ,",
    "the mass of the central heavy object is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the proton fractional momentum losses measured in the roman pot detectors .",
    "at this level , we already see the advantages of the exclusive events .",
    "since , there is no energy loss due to additional radiation or pomeron remnants , we can reconstruct the total diffractive mass , which means the mass of the diffractively produced object ( the higgs , dijets , @xmath3 , @xmath38 , events , @xmath0 pairs ... ) , very precisely using the kinematical measurements from the roman pot detectors .",
    "the mass resolution is thus coming directly from the @xmath30 resolution which is expected to be of the order of 1% .",
    "for inclusive events , the mass resolution will not be so good since part of the energy is lost in radiation , which means that we measure the mass of the heavy object produced diffractively and the pomeron remnants together very precisely . to get a good mass resolution using inclusive events requires a good measurement of the pomeron remnants and soft radiation and being able to veto on it .",
    "while inclusive diffraction has already been observed at many colliders , the question arises whether exclusive events exist or not since they have never been observed so far .",
    "this is definitely an area where the tevatron experiments can help to test the models and show evidence for the existence of exclusive events if any .",
    "it is crucial to be able to test the different models before the start of the lhc .",
    "the d  and cdf experiments at the tevatron ( and the lhc experiments ) are ideal places to look for exclusive events in dijet or @xmath39 channels for instance where exclusive events are expected to occur at high dijet mass fraction .",
    "so far , no evidence of the existence of exclusive events has been found .",
    "the best way to show evidence of the existence of exclusive events would be the measurement of the ratio of the diphoton to the dilepton cross sections as a function of the diphoton / dilepton mass ratio ( the diphoton - dilepton mass ratio being defined as the diphoton - dilepton mass divided by the total diffractive mass ) .",
    "the reason is quite simple : it is possible to produce exclusively diphoton but not dilepton directly since ( @xmath40 ) is possible but not ( @xmath41 ) directly at leading order .",
    "the ratio of the diphoton to the dilepton cross section should show a bump or a change of slope towards high diphoton - dilepton masses if exclusive events exist .",
    "unfortunately , the production cross section of such events is small and it will probably not be possible to perform this study before the start of the lhc .",
    "another easier way to show the existence of such events would be to study the correlation between the gap size measured in both @xmath29 and @xmath42 directions and the value of @xmath43 measured using roman pot detectors , which can be performed in the d  experiment .",
    "the gap size between the pomeron remnant and the protons detected in roman pot detector is of the order of @xmath44 for usual diffractive events ( the measurement giving a slightly smaller value to be in the acceptance of the forward detectors ) while exclusive events show a much higher value for the rapidity gap since the gap occurs between the jets ( or the @xmath39 ) and the proton detected in roman pot detectors ( in other words , there is no pomeron remnant).-jets to all jets are needed @xcite . ]",
    "another observable leading to the same conclusion would be the correlation between @xmath30 computed using roman pot detectors and using only the central detector .",
    "another way to access the existence of exclusive events would be via qcd evolution . if one assumes that the dglap evolution equations work for parton densities in the pomeron , it is natural to compare the predictions of perturbative qcd with for instance dijet production in double pomeron exchange as a function of the dijet mass fraction ( defined as the ratio of the dijet mass divided by the total diffractive mass ) for different domains in diffractive mass .",
    "it has been shown that the dependence of the exclusive production cross section as a function of the dijet mass is much larger than the one of the inclusive processes . in other words ,",
    "if exclusive events exist , it is expected that the evolution of the dijet cross section in double pomeron exchanges as a function of dijet mass fraction in bins of dijet masses will be incompatible with standard qcd dglap evolution , and will require an additional contribution , namely the exclusive ones .",
    "it will be quite interesting to perform such an analysis at the tevatron if statistics allows .",
    "results are given in fig . 1 for a higgs mass of 120 gev , in terms of the signal to background ratio s / b , as a function of the higgs boson mass resolution .",
    "let us notice that the background is mainly due the exclusive @xmath45 production .",
    "however the tail of the inclusive @xmath45 production can also be a relevant contribution and this is related to the high @xmath46 gluon density which is badly known as present .",
    "it is thus quite important to constrain these distributions using tevatron data as suggested in a next section .    in order to obtain an s / b of 3 ( resp . 1 , 0.5 ) , a mass resolution of about 0.3 gev ( resp .",
    "1.2 , 2.3 gev ) is needed . the forward detector design of @xcite claims a resolution of about 2.-2.5 gev , which leads to a s / b of about 0.4 - 0.6 .",
    "improvements in this design would increase the s / b ratio as indicated on the figure . as usual , this number is enhanced by a large factor if one considers supersymmetric higgs boson production with favorable higgs or squark field mixing parameters .",
    "the cross sections obtained after applying the survival probability of 3% at the lhc as well as the s / b ratios are given in table [ sb ] if one assumes a resolution on the missing mass of about 1 gev ( which is the most optimistic scenario ) .",
    "the acceptances of the roman pot detectors as well as the simulation of the cms detectors have been taken into account in these results .",
    "let us also notice that the missing mass method will allow to perform a @xmath0 mass measurement using exclusive ( or quasi - exclusive ) @xmath47 events in double pomeron exchanges , and qed processes @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the qed processes is that their cross section is perfectly known and that this measurement only depends on the mass resolution and the roman pot acceptance . in the same way , it is possible to measure the mass of the top quark in @xmath3 events in double pomeron exchanges @xcite as we will see in the following .",
    ".exclusive higgs production cross section for different higgs masses , number of signal and background events for 100 fb@xmath48 , ratio , and number of standard deviations ( @xmath49 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
