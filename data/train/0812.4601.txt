    "spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains provide an excellent ground for studying various properties of quantum many - particle systems since after performing the jordan - wigner transformation these spin models can be reduced to systems of noninteracting spinless fermions @xcite .",
    "one interesting issue which has emerged recently in the theory of quantum spin systems is the study of effects of multi - site interspin interactions .",
    "such interactions may arise , e.g. , in an effective spin model for the standard hubbard model at half filling in higher orders ( beyond @xmath4 ) of the strong - coupling @xmath5 expansion @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by quantum spin systems with energy currents @xcite . as early as 1971 @xcite m.  suzuki proposed generalized one - dimensional @xmath0 models with multi - site interactions , allowing for rigorous analysis by the jordan - wigner fermionization approach .",
    "an exactly integrable spin-1/2 @xmath6 quantum spin chain with three - site interactions was suggested in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) .",
    "an @xmath0 version of this model was considered independently in ref . .",
    "another version of the spin-1/2 @xmath0 chain with three - site interactions was suggested in refs . .",
    "later on spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains with three - site interactions were considered in a number of papers concerning quantum phase transitions , transport properties and entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , in ref . the spin-1/2 @xmath0 chain with alternating three - site interaction has been introduced , whereas in ref .",
    "dynamic characteristics of a few quantum spin chains with multi - site interactions have been discussed .",
    "however , an exhaustive study of the dynamic properties of spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains with multi - site interactions , similar to that for conventional @xmath0 chains @xcite , has not been performed yet . with our paper",
    "we attempt to fill this gap .    in what follows we consider the hamiltonian @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the isotropic @xmath0 ( or @xmath10 ) exchange interaction and the @xmath1-component of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction between the neighboring sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two types of three - site exchange interactions introduced in refs . and in ref .",

    "( [ 1.01 ] ) runs over all @xmath16 lattice sites ; boundary conditions ( open or periodic ) are not important for the quantities to be calculated in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 . in this study in most cases we restrict ourselves to homogeneous chains with site - independent values of the interspin interaction constants and field , i.e. @xmath18 etc .",
    "we start by discussing the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.01 ] ) in order to show the close relations between the models of ref .",
    "( i.e. with the @xmath19 type of three - site interactions ) and of refs .",
    "( i.e. with the @xmath20 type of three - site interactions ) which were not discussed before . consider a local spin rotation around the @xmath1 axis @xmath21 under that transformation , the parameters for the interspin interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ 1.01 ] ) are mapped as follows : @xmath22 this shows clearly that the rotations ( [ 1.02 ] ) may be employed to simplify the hamiltonian ( [ 1.01 ] ) by eliminating some of the interactions .",
    "for example , in a homogeneous chain we may achieve @xmath23 by setting @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the remaining coupling constants then are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .    more interestingly , using eqs . ( [ 1.02 ] ) , ( [ 1.03 ] )",
    "we can eliminate from the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 1.01 ] ) either of the three - site interactions , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "introducing @xmath29 we note that @xmath30 if @xmath31 .",
    "these @xmath32 values can be used for calculating the @xmath33 and @xmath34 by using @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; the surviving three - site coupling is @xmath37 . if , on the other hand , we put @xmath38 we get @xmath39 whereas @xmath40 . for the uniform chain , on which we mainly focus in what follows , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and assuming @xmath44 we get @xmath45 , @xmath46 and either @xmath47 , @xmath48 if @xmath49 or @xmath50 , @xmath51 if @xmath52 .    to summarize this part",
    ", we have shown that while studying effects of three - site interactions on the basis of the model ( [ 1.01 ] ) it would be sufficient to consider the model ( [ 1.01 ] ) with either nonzero parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 or @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 since the most general case when all four types of interactions have nonzero values can be reduced either to the former case or to the latter case .",
    "one consequence of this is that the model considered in ref . can be reduced to the model considered in ref . .",
    "namely , starting from the model with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and choosing @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 we arrive at the model with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath47 .",
    "vice versa , starting from the model with @xmath53 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and performing the same transformation we arrive at the model with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath50 . in our study of the dynamic properties of quantum spin chains with three - site interactions we focus on the case @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 leaving a detailed study of other cases for the future .",
    "the peculiar nature of the three - site interactions studied here becomes clear after performing the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath68 plugging ( [ 1.04 ] ) into ( [ 1.01 ] ) we find @xmath69 i.e. the hamiltonian of the spin model is a simple bilinear form in terms of spinless fermions .",
    "for the uniform case it is convenient to employ periodic boundary conditions in the spin hamiltonian ( [ 1.01 ] ) . that leads either to periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions in the fermion hamiltonian ( [ 1.05 ] ) , depending on whether the number of spinless fermions is even or odd .",
    "either the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals or the next - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals can be made real ( or purely imaginary ) by applying a gauge transformation , which is the analog of eqs .",
    "( [ 1.02 ] ) , ( [ 1.03 ] ) in the spinless - fermion picture .    in the uniform case we can diagonalize ( [ 1.05 ] ) by performing the fourier transformation @xmath70 with @xmath71 [ @xmath72 in the subspaces with odd [ even ] numbers of spinless fermions and @xmath73 ( if @xmath16 is even ) or @xmath74 ( if @xmath16 is odd ) arriving at @xmath75    from eq . ( [ 1.07 ] ) we immediately conclude that the external magnetic field @xmath76 plays the role of a chemical potential for spinless fermions .",
    "more interestingly , the two terms proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the elementary excitation spectrum @xmath79 ( [ 1.07 ] ) which arise from the three - site spin interactions , may modify @xmath79 drastically , leading to new ground - state phases .",
    "we consider the case @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; for this case @xmath80 . as long as @xmath81 the spinless fermion system may possess only two fermi points , whereas for sufficiently strong three - site interaction , @xmath82 , the spinless fermion system may also possess four fermi points . the ground - state phase diagram obtained in ref .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "+    two different spin liquid phases reflect the importance of the existence of two versus four fermi points , as discussed already earlier @xcite . as a result , in addition to the conventional quantum phase transition between the spin liquid i phase and the ferromagnetic phase , the spin model may exhibit also quantum phase transitions 1 ) between the spin liquid i phase and the spin liquid ii phase and 2 ) between the spin liquid ii phase and the ferromagnetic phase , as well as a point where three phases meet ( see fig .  [ fig01 ] ) . the spin liquid i phase and the spin liquid ii phase",
    "are characterized by a change in the power - law decay and oscillating factor of spin - spin correlations ( see eqs .",

    "( 10 ) , ( 11 ) in ref . )",
    ". a nonzero value of @xmath89 signalizes the appearance of a new ( chiral ) spin liquid phase which emerges when three - site interactions exceed a critical value .",
    "eliminating @xmath90 terms from the hamiltonian by the unitary transformation discussed above one arrives at the spin model with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath67 , @xmath50 ( i.e. the model similar to the one considered in ref . ) and @xmath93 .",
    "the latter quantity @xmath94 apparently has no relation to the order parameter @xmath84 used in ref .  .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that the spin model ( [ 1.01 ] ) can be written as a one - dimensional model of hard - core bosons after introducing the on - site creation and annihilation operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the hard - core boson model is obtained by taking the @xmath98 limit of the boson hubbard model . with this mapping in the case of a conventional transverse @xmath10 chain",
    "the ferromagnetic phase corresponds to the mott insulator with @xmath99 or @xmath100 ( the thermodynamic average taken at zero temperature , @xmath101 ) , whereas the spin liquid ( spin liquid i ) phase is the superfluid with @xmath102 .",
    "as a function of the field / chemical potential @xmath76 the model displays two superfluid to mott insulator transitions at @xmath103 @xcite . after switching on the three - site interaction @xmath104 ,",
    "the picture remains qualitatively the same as long as @xmath105 . if @xmath106 exceeds 1/2 we face an additional transition which manifests itself as an extra cusp in the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath76 .",
    "thus , following the ground - state average boson number per site ( or @xmath108 ) as a function of @xmath76 one may reproduce the various phases and the phase transitions between them shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "an alternative way to follow the changes in the ground - state dependence of @xmath109 on @xmath76 is to examine the ground - state susceptibility @xmath110 as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "we notice that the ground - state dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath76 is the same as that of @xmath112 on @xmath76 , where @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the one - particle density of states . as a result ,",
    "the ground - state dependence @xmath115 vs @xmath76 exhibits a square - root van hove singularity along the lines separating different phases in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "( the only exception are the two points @xmath116 , @xmath117 at which @xmath118 and therefore @xmath115 displays a van hove singularity with the exponent 3/4 . ) the divergence of the uniform static @xmath2 susceptibility implies a `` ferromagnetic '' character of the associated phase transitions .    to summarize , there is no doubt that while `` the two fermi points spinless fermions '' transform into `` the four fermi points spinless fermions '' some noticeable changes in the properties of the spin model should take place , however , a transparent quantity associated with this modification of the fermi surface topology which may play the role of the order parameter is still lacking .",
    "finally , it is worth noting the studies on the one - dimensional hubbard model with next - nearest - neighbor hopping because the noninteracting limit of that model resembles eq .",
    "( [ 1.07 ] ) ( see , e.g. , ref . and",
