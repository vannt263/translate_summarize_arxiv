    "the periodic xxz chain is a quantum system with hamiltonian h_xxz=-_j=1^n ( _ j+1^x _ j^x + _",
    "j+1^y _ j^y+_j+1^z _",
    "j^z),where @xmath8 denotes the pauli matrix @xmath9 acting at the @xmath10th site of the chain .",
    "we label our sites from right to left and identify the @xmath11th site with the 1st site of the chain .",
    "this simple model has been the subject of a huge amount of attention from the time of bethe @xcite until the present day @xcite .",
    "there are two main reasons for this interest .",
    "firstly , the model is quantum integrable and has proved to be both a source and test - bed for a set of theoretical techniques applicable to such systems .",
    "these approaches include the bethe ansatz , quantum inverse scattering @xcite , the corner transfer matrix and q operator @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , quantum groups @xcite and the vertex operator approach @xcite .",
    "secondly , the xxz model is of physical interest ; it was developed as an idealised model of ferromagnetic systems and has recently found direct experimental realisation in a range of quasi - one - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian has also made a guest appearance in @xmath12 super yang mills theory in the last decade @xcite .",
    "one of the key goals of all the theoretical work on the xxz chain has been to exploit its quantum integrability in order to compute exact expressions for correlation functions .",
    "this goal was finally achieved for the infinite lattice in the 1990s .",
    "two independent approaches were developed .",
    "the first was invented by the kyoto group and deals with the infinite system with antiferromagnetic boundary conditions @xcite . in this case , the hamiltonian commutes with the action of the quantum affine algebra @xmath13 .",
    "this observation ultimately allowed the kyoto group to produce an entirely representation theoretic expression for arbitrary correlation functions .",
    "we will refer to the techniques of the kyoto group as the ` vertex operator approach ' .",
    "the second approach , developed by the lyon group , involved a direct bethe - ansatz computation of correlation functions for the finite - size system and a careful thermodynamic limit @xcite .    in this paper , we study the xxz model in a setting that we refer to as a _ fractured _ xxz chain .",
    "we consider the eigenstates of two separate hamiltonia .",
    "the first hamiltonian is simply the infinite - size antiferromagnetic hamiltonian h=-_j ( _ j+1^x _ j^x + _ j+1^y _ j^y+ _ j+1^z",
    "_ j^z),= , -1<q<0,that acts on the space with antiferromagnetic boundary conditions @xmath14 or @xmath15 at plus and minus infinity ( we use @xmath16 and @xmath17 to refer to two eigenstates of @xmath18 - see section 2 for a more precise definition of this space ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is the one already dealt with by the kyoto group and we simply recall the results that we need . in particular , labelling the two antiferromagnetic boundary conditions by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we make use of the two corresponding lowest energy eigenstates @xmath21 constructed in @xcite .",
    "the second hamiltonian we consider , which acts on the same space as above , is a split hamiltonian h=h_l+h_r , where the left and right hamiltonia are h_l&= & -_j1 ( _ j+1^x _ j^x + _ j+1^y _",
    "j^y+_j+1^z _ j^z)+h _ 1^z , + h_r&= & -_j0 ( _ j^x _ j-1^x + _ j^y _",
    "j-1^y+_j^z _ j-1^z)-h _",
    "0^z.with this hamiltonian , there is split or fracture between the sites at position 1 and 0 , with no nearest - neighbour interaction between them .",
    "there is also a staggered magnetic field @xmath22 that acts at the boundaries of the fracture .",
    "let us label the vacuum of @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "this state will of course be simply a tensor product of the respective lowest eigenstates of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the key results of this paper are exact expressions for _(i),and for all correlation functions of the form |",
    "o_(i),where @xmath3 is any local operator .",
    "we obtain these expression by developing the vertex operator approach .",
    "there are several reasons why we look at the matrix elements and for this system .",
    "firstly , they are ` natural ' objects to consider in the language of the related 6-vertex model",
    ". we shall develop this point of view throughout the paper , but in brief , the matrix element @xmath27 is related to the partition function of the infinite lattice shown in figure [ fracpfn ] . as such , it can be expressed as a matrix element of two boundary , and two bulk corner transfer matrices representing the four quadrants of the lattice .",
    "corner transfer matrices of both boundary and bulk types have been considered previously in the vertex operator approach @xcite , and it is very natural to put the two types together to form the fractured partition function of figure [ fracpfn ] .",
    "the second motivation for our interest in these fractured systems is their potential physical significance .",
    "one application is in the description of a _ local quantum quench _ in which a spin chain that consists of two separated domains for time @xmath28 is joined at time @xmath29 .",
    "such local quenches have been investigated using conformal field theory techniques in @xcite .",
    "in such a context , the squared modulus of the overlap @xmath6 , which we compute exactly , is referred to as the _ fidelity _ and plays a role in understanding the dynamical behaviour of quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "a final reason for our interest in this fractured geometry is the potential connection with existing work on two - dimensional models on a wedge of angle @xmath30 .",
    "both massless and massive systems have been considered in such wedge geometries in @xcite and @xcite , and there exists the possibility of establishing a relation with our work when @xmath31 .    in this paper we construct the matrix element @xmath32 as a specialisation of a function @xmath33 defined as a matrix element of a product of vertex operators . we find that @xmath33 satisfies a boundary qkz equation similar to the form found in @xcite , but at a different level .",
    "we use a free - field realisation to derive a general multiple - integral expression for @xmath33 .",
    "specialising to the case of the magnetisation , corresponding to the choice @xmath34 , we integrate the resulting expression to produce a q - expansion to order @xmath35 .",
    "based on this expansion we make the following conjecture for the exact expression -_(0)| _ 1^z_(0)= 1 + 2(1-r ) _",
    "n=1^ , [ mag]where @xmath36 is related to the magnetic field @xmath37 by h= .note that @xmath38 corresponds to the magnetic field @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "thus we have the special cases - _ ( 0)| _ 1^z_(0)=    1 + 4 _",
    "n=1^ = , & h=0 , + 1,&h=    .the first expression coincides with the known bulk spontaneous magnetisation @xcite .",
    "we argue that this result and the @xmath41 limit are as physically expected .",
    "we also make some observations about the special nature of the point @xmath42 .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows : in section 2 , we provide the definition of the model . in section 3",
    ", we describe the realisation of the model within the vertex operator approach .",
    "we construct the vacuum and excited eigenstates for the two hamiltonia @xmath43 and @xmath23 and give a vertex operator expression for correlation functions .",
    "we then demonstrate how these same correlation function expressions arise from a corner transfer matrix approach .",
    "we go on to show that the correlation functions obey a version of the boundary qkz equation . in section 4",
    ", we make use of the free - field realisation to produce a general integral formula for correlation functions and show how its specialisation leads to the result .",
    "finally , we summarise and make some concluding comments in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we define our fractured xxz/6-vertex model . all conventions closely follow those of the previous work on the vertex operator approach to the bulk @xcite and boundary @xcite xxz models .",
    "our starting point is to consider a vertex model defined in terms of the bulk and boundary boltzmann weights @xmath44 and @xmath45 defined in @xcite and reproduced in appendix a. for convenience , we also define @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "the sum can be represented as a basic hypergeometric function ( see , for example , chapter 17 of @xcite ) in the following way : g",
    "p^(0)(-q^-1,1;r)_+- = .hence we obtain the magnetisation -m^(0)(r)&= & g ( -p^(i)(-q^-1,;r)_-++p^(i)(-q^-1,;r)_+-)=-1 + 2 g p^(0)(-q^-1,1;r)_+- + & = & 1 + 2(1-r ) _ n=1^ which can also be re - expressed at -m^(0)(r)&=&2 -1 .it also follows from the symmetry that we have -m^(0)(r)=m^(1)(r^-1 ) .    the form is similar , but different , to the magnetisation at site 1 of the pure boundary model of figure [ boundpfn ] considered in @xcite : -m^(0)_bound(r)&=&1 + 2(1-r)^2 _ n=1^ .",
    "the three special cases @xmath233 corresponding to @xmath234 are of separate interest :    @xmath235 when @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , we can sum the expression to obtain -m^(0)(r=-1)&= & .this coincides with the expression for the spontaneous magnetisation of the bulk model @xcite ( the minus sign is just due to the choice of convention for the @xmath19 ground state of figure [ fracgs ] ) .",
    "it seems physically reasonable that the magnetisation at position 1 in figure [ fracorr1 ] is simply the same as that of the zero - field bulk model when the fracture magnetic field is zero .",
    "@xmath235 when @xmath42 ( @xmath236 ) , we have -m^(0)(r=0)= which coincides with the magnetisation of the boundary model at this value of the magnetic field . at this point",
    "the overlap @xmath237 is a maximum and thus the bulk system is closest to the tensor product of right and left boundary systems .",

    "@xmath235 when @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , we have @xmath238 .",
    "again , this is as expected , since the presence of the term @xmath239 in @xmath23 will force the magnetisation at site 1 to @xmath240 as @xmath241 .",

    "the coincidence of @xmath244 with the spontaneous magnetisation at @xmath39 , and with @xmath242 at @xmath206 and @xmath241 is evident .     and boundary magnetisation @xmath242 at site 1 as a function of magnetic field @xmath22 ( at @xmath243),width=340 ]",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the novel problem of computing xxz correlation functions in the fractured geometry of figure [ fracorr1 ] .",
    "we have expressed these correlation functions in terms of matrix elements @xmath33 defined by that obey a level 2 boundary qkz equation . making use of the free - field realisation",

    "we have specialised this formula to the case relevant to the magnetisation at site 1 , and by carrying out a high - order q expansion of the integral have arrived at the conjectural form given by equation .",
    "this form is similar , but different , to the magnetisation at the corresponding position in the boundary geometry of figure [ boundpfn ] .",
    "the latter magnetisation was computed in @xcite , in which case the corresponding integral was carried out exactly by summing residues . however , while the final magnetisation expressions are similar , the integrand in our fractured case is considerably more complicated that in the pure boundary case of @xcite .",
    "ultimately , this fact is linked to the additional @xmath106 factor that distinguishes the boundary and fracture correlation functions given by and .",
    "the origin of this extra factor lies in the presence of two extra two corner transfer matrices @xmath246 in the fractured partition function of figure [ fracpfn ] when compared to the boundary partition function of figure [ boundpfn ] .",
    "this additional factor @xmath106 factor is also responsible for the different level of the boundary qkz equations in the two cases .",
    "the corner magnetisation in a wedge geometry has been considered before .",
    "conformal field theories in such a geometry were analysed by a conformal mapping from the upper - half plane @xcite . for the ising model on a triangular lattice , a finite - size scaling approach was taken in @xcite , while the ising model on a cone was considered in the same paper by taking a trace over a variable number of corner transfer matrices",

    "we have calculated the overlap @xmath188 . as we have mentioned in the introduction , our fractured geometry , and in particular this overlap ,",
    "have recently become objects of interest in the literature on local quantum quenches and their use as a probe of the dynamics of quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "so far , most results in this field have been obtained using conformal field theory techniques , and we hope and anticipate that our exact massive lattice model results will be valuable in this arena .    finally , the vertex operator approach to boundary problems has been generalised in a number of directions @xcite , and there will be corresponding generalisations of the analysis of fractured models that we have developed here .",
    "in particular , the analysis should be generalisable to abf models @xcite and higher spin models .",
