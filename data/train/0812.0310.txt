    "spectropolarimetry is a valuable tool for studying a number of important properties of stars .",
    "circular polarization is one of the few direct means of measuring stellar magnetic fields ( e.g. , babcock 1958 ) .",
    "linear polarization , such as from thomson scattering in circumstellar envelopes of hot stars , has been important for ascertaining deviations from sphericity in circumstellar media ( e.g. , the be stars [ poeckert & marlborough 1976 ; mclean & brown 1978 ; wood , bjorkman , & bjorkman 1997 ] and supernovae [ wang  1996 ; leonard  2005 ] ) . a challenge for this area",
    "is that net polarizations tend to be small so that large telescopes are required to obtain sufficiently high quality data for sources that are only moderately faint .",
    "fortunately , astronomers now have access to several 810  m class or larger telescopes that are outfitted with polarimeters",
    ". with such instrumentation , studies of polarizations across spectral lines  combining good spectral resolution with large telescope collecting areas  have become increasingly popular and important for understanding structure in circumstellar media .",
    "here we present an analysis of variable linear polarization across the h@xmath1 line and in the adjacent continuum for the a0 supergiant star hd  92207 at seven epochs over a period of three months .",
    "this particular star was chosen for several different reasons .",
    "it has been studied spectroscopically by kaufer  ( 1996 ) who found substantial line profile and line equivalent width changes at h@xmath1 .",
    "these variations appear to be related to the well - known discrete absorption components ( or `` dacs '' ) that are commonly seen in uv lines of early - type stars ( e.g. , massa  1995 ; kaper  1996 ) .",
    "hd  92207 is not far removed from the luminous blue variable stars and o supergiants that show variable continuum polarizations ( lupie & nordsieck 1987 ; taylor  1991 ; harries , howarth , & evans 2002 ; davies , vink , & oudmaijer 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , the relatively late spectral type of hd  92207 within the early - type class indicates that h@xmath1 acts more nearly as a scattering line than a recombination line ( puls  1998 ) , thus making the star a prime candidate for exploring variable polarization across a line dominated by wind emission .",
    "a description of the observations is presented in the following section .",
    "an analysis of the data is provided in section  3 .",
    "a discussion of the implications of the results is given in section  4 .",
    "the observations of the supergiant hd92207 were obtained in service mode from 2007 january to 2007 march at the european southern observatory with fors1 ( focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph ) , mounted on the 8-m kueyen telescope of the vlt .",
    "this multi - mode instrument is equipped with polarization analyzing optics comprising super - achromatic half - wave and quarter - wave phase retarder plates , and a wollaston prism with a beam divergence of 22 in standard resolution mode . to perform linear polarization measurements , a wollaston prism and a half - wave retarder waveplate",
    "were used .",
    "the waveplate was rotated in 22.5@xmath3 steps between 0@xmath3 and 157.5@xmath3 , taking two 20s sub - exposures at each of the eight positions .",
    "the grism600r was used in the fims ( fors instrumental mask simulator ) observing mode in the wavelength range 46726795 to cover the hydrogen balmer lines h@xmath1 and h@xmath4 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the fors1 spectra taken with this setting and a 0.4 slit was r@xmath53000 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of about 100 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the readout time was reduced to about 40s by windowing the ccd , and the use of a non - standard readout mode ( a,1@xmath71,low ) provided a broader dynamic range , allowing us to increase the s / n of the individual spectra . due to the brightness of the target ( m@xmath8 ) and",
    "excellent seeing conditions , a few exposures obtained during the second and the last observing night were saturated . for these phases ,",
    "only measurements at the retarder waveplate positions between 0@xmath3 and 67.5@xmath3 are available .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath9 przybilla  ( 2006 ) ; @xmath10 kudritzki  ( 1996 ) ; @xmath11 best fit model parameters ( see text ) .",
    "velocity laws with @xmath12 and @xmath13 were considered , and the case of @xmath12 produced a better match to the data . in this case",
    "the location of the guiding center is given analytically with azimuth @xmath14 by    @xmath15\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\left . -\\frac{1}{b}\\,\\ln\\left[\\frac{w(u)}{w_0}\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the density for the spiral - shaped perturbed region is treated as an _ excess _ of density above the otherwise spherically symmetric wind .",
    "this density excess in the spiral pattern is taken to scale with the spherical wind density in our `` toy '' model , thus we conveniently parametrize the excess by a constant factor @xmath18 , for @xmath19 the spherical wind density .",
    "in addition to the solution for the guiding center , we also need the cross - section of the spiral .",
    "the cross - section ( i.e. , the intersection of the spiral pattern with a spherical shell ) is treated as circular .",
    "this spherical `` cap '' is axisymmetric , and so assuming the electron scattering is optically thin , the polarization from any given slice of the spiral is given by brown & mclean ( 1978 ) , along with the finite star depolarization correction factor of cassinelli , nordsieck , & murison ( 1987 ) .",
    "summing up contributions from all the caps yields the polarization from the structure as a function of rotational phase and viewing inclination for the rotation axis of the star .",
    "note that our model accounts for occultation of scattered light by the intervening star , but only in an approximate way .",
    "we consider a slice as entirely occulted if its guiding center lies behind the star , and unocculted otherwise .",
    "the principal model parameters are the density excess @xmath20 , the half - opening angle of the spiral @xmath21 , an orientation angle between the observer @xmath22 axes and those of the star system @xmath23 , and finally the inclination of the rotation axis of the star @xmath24 .",
    "using a reduced chi - square evaluation for a grid of model polarization light curves , table  [ tab2 ] lists the model parameters that provide the best fit to the observed _ continuum _ data .",
    "the star and wind properties of hd  92207 are taken from przybilla  ( 2006 ) , except that the mass - loss rate is taken from kudritzki  ( 1999 ) and does not account for clumping .",
    "the most reasonable match to the observed continuum polarizations in the neighborhood of h@xmath1 is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the upper panel is for @xmath25 and the lower one for @xmath26 , displayed as percentage polarizations .",
    "the rotational phases depend on the star s rotation period . given the radius and minimum rotation speed from table  [ tab2 ] , the maximum period is @xmath27d .",
    "the true period is @xmath28 , where @xmath24 is constrained from our model fitting . as the ephemeris is not known , we assigned the rotational phase `` 0 '' to the date of our first observation , and the phases appearing in figure  [ fig3 ] represent values for our best fit model at @xmath29 .    for the model",
    "fitting , there are seven free parameters : the four listed above plus three offsets ",
    "one for rotational phase , a vertical offset in @xmath30 , and an independent one in @xmath31 . with fourteen data points in total ,",
    "the reduced chi - square for our best simultaneous fit to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 lightcurves is 1.6 .",
    "that value is primarily a reflection of one discrepant data point , the first one in the observed @xmath26 ligthcurve .",
    "our model is inherently smooth , whereas the line variability indicates the presence of variable wind structure . for the continuum polarization , this wind structure can act as a source of `` noise '' .",
    "better temporal and phase coverage is needed to interpret the polarimetric lightcurve more fully .",
    "the non - zero variation of @xmath26 indicates that @xmath24 is not edge - on to the system , since no @xmath32 could result for such a perspective when the circumstellar scattering environment is top - bottom symmetric .",
    "however , @xmath32 is much less than @xmath33 , suggestive that @xmath24 is not close to pole - on .",
    "since the interstellar polarization is not known , there is freedom to shift the observed points with respect to the model in both phase ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) and vertical offset to best match a model curve .",
    "the vertical offsets for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are independent , but the phase shift must be the same for both .",
    "there is also freedom to rotate the model system relative to the observer @xmath30-@xmath31 system , but we found the angle to be small , with @xmath35 .",
    "the match between the model and the continuum data appears to be best around an inclination of @xmath36 with a half - opening angle of @xmath37 .",
    "a @xmath38 opening angle corresponds to the van vleck angle and yields the maximum polarization when other parameters are held fixed , thus allowing us to minimize the value of the excess density .",
    "because the spherical wind is relatively thin in electron scattering ( @xmath39 for solar abundances with ionized h and he neutral ) , a fairly large value of @xmath40 is needed to match the observed @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "such a large excess would need to be justified through physical modeling of the stellar wind and atmosphere .",
    "overall , the match is reasonably good except for the first data point in the lower panel for @xmath26 which we can not reconcile to the model after exploring a range of opening angles , viewing inclinations , and @xmath20 values .",
    "based on the work of davies  ( 2005 ) for luminous blue variables , wind inhomogeneities are likely contributing a random contribution of unknown amplitude to the observed polarizations from hd  92207 , which makes the interpretation of any globally coherent variation with phase challenging for such sparse sampling . even though our spiral model is simplistic",
    ", it does capture the essential points inherent to any corotating structure in terms of the generic trends of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with phase , viewing inclination , and density .",
    "it is certainly clear that much better sampling of the polarimetric light curve in the continuum is needed to critically assess the existence of a corotating region in the wind .    turning to the h@xmath1 line",
    ", the p cygni morphology indicates that the line is dominated by the stellar wind . in contrast",
    ", the h@xmath4 line is in absorption and shows no variable polarization . at the spectral type of hd  97702 , the @xmath41 level of hydrogen can act as the effective ground state ( puls  1998 ) explaining why it shows such a strong p  cygni shape .",
    "it also means that line scattering polarization ( e.g. , hamilton 1947 ) may influence the observed variable polarization in h@xmath1 .",
    "for example , such effects were explored by jeffery ( 1987 , 1989 ) in the case of sn1987a .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] displays the polarized @xmath25 and @xmath26 spectra in velocity along with the p cygni profiles to emphasize where polarization changes occur within the line in relation to the absorption trough and emission peak .",
    "the vertical scale for the measured percent polarizations are shown on the right axes , whereas the scale for the continuum normalized p cygni lines is displayed on the left axes .",
    "for the first 5 panels , it is typically the case that either @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or both vary most around the line core over an interval that is about a third of the wind terminal speed .",
    "one clear exception is for march 26 that shows the strongest change in polarization across the line in @xmath30 and aligns quite well with the redshifted emission peak , although it appears that @xmath26 actually increases in absolute value .",
    "the observed polarizations are negative , so zero polarization is toward the top of each panel .",
    "curiously , there is a depolarization at the same location the night prior , except in @xmath31 instead of @xmath30 .",
    "the overall depolarizations across the emission peak in the line relative to the continuum would seem to be a classic `` line effect '' .",
    "polarization is normalized at each wavelength to the total emission .",
    "if the line formation leads to unpolarized radiation that is largely unscattered by free electrons before emerging from the wind , then the additional line emission tends to reduce the polarization at those wavelengths relative to values outside the line .",
    "in fact , this can be an excellent way of placing an upper limit to the interstellar polarization to the star .",
    "however , the h@xmath1 line of hd  92207 is perplexing because its behavior is not consistent .",
    "moreover , night - to - night variations in the h@xmath1 polarization are hard to understand in terms of the spiral structure that we have considered for the continuum polarization given that the star s rotation period is of order a year .",
    "it is worth pointing out that harries ( 2000 ) modeled wavelength - dependent polarization across h@xmath1 for the o supergiant @xmath42  pup .",
    "his models did not include contributions to the polarization from line scattering ; rather , he obtained changes of polarization across the line owing to the influence of line opacity for the polarization produced by thomson scattering .",
    "the application of harries models to hd  92207 is unclear .",
    "there is the likelihood of a significant line scattering contribution to h@xmath1 because of hd  92207 s much later spectral type as compared to @xmath42  pup .",
    "other effects such as dynamic changes in the wind or variable stellar illumination ( c.f .",
    ", al - malki  1999 ) will be needed to interpret the polarization across h@xmath1 .",
    "for example , it would be useful to combine the methods of li  2000 and davies  2007 for polarimetric variability from wind clumping and electron scattering with the resonance scattering polarization effects explored by ignace , nordsieck , & cassinelli ( 2004 ) for stationary winds . with limited coverage of the rotational phase and only modest spectral resolution ,",
    "the existing dataset is too poor to undertake a detailed calculation of the h@xmath1 line to interpret the observed polarizations . with future data ,",
    "such an effort would be worthwhile because the continuum polarization constrains the global wind morphology whereas the h@xmath1 line is sensitive to vector velocity flow .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for a number of helpful suggestions .",
    "ri thanks gary henson for numerous discussions about the polarization changes across lines .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant from the national science foundation ( ast-0807664 ) .",
