    "in many stock markets , price limit rules are set expecting to reduce remarked swings by cooling off traders irrational mania .",
    "a stable stock market has lower risks and thus attracts more people to participate .",
    "this is certainly increase the resource reallocation function of stock markets and benefits the economies .",
    "price limit rules constrain intraday prices to move within a preset price interval embraced by a price up limit and a price down limit .",
    "usually , the limit prices are determined by fixed fluctuation percentages in reference to the closing price of the previous day . in most stock markets , the fluctuation percentages for up - limit and down - limit are symmetric . however , there are also examples for asymmetric price limits especially in certain market states . after the price reaches its limit ,",
    "a circuit breaker may be triggered causing trading halt in some markets , while in other markets the traders can continue to trade shares @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the price limit rules is controversial .",
    "it is expected to have a cooling - off effect to reduce the volatility of stocks @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", it may also cause a magnet effect , which refers to the phenomenon that the price limit acts as a magnet to attract more trades leading to higher trading intensity and price volatility and increases the probability of price rise or fall when the price is closer to the limit price @xcite .",
    "the magnet effect occurs when the traders fear of the lack of liquidity and possible position lock caused by imminent price limit hits , and the traders are thus eager to protect themselves through submitting aggressive sub - optimal orders , which usually induces large price variations and heavy trading volumes .",
    "since the cooling effect or the magnet effect takes place at the intraday level , studies of the presence of either effect , the evolution of pre - hit dynamics and the performance of price limit rules are of great interest to academics , investors and regulators to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of how the market structure and the investors trading behavior affects price discovery .",
    "the study of price limits started on futures markets @xcite .",
    "empirical analysis has been carried out for different markets at different time periods .",
    "there is no consensus on the presence of a magnet effect or a cooling - off effect .",
    "arak and cook investigated if price behavior is infected by price limits on the treasury bond futures market and found no evidence of a magnet effect but rather a reversal effect @xcite .",
    "berkman and steenbeek compared the price formation processes under different price limits between osaka securities exchange and nikkei 225 index on the singapore international monetary exchange and found no significant arbitrage opportunities between the two markets @xcite . in recent years , empirical studies about the magnet effect concentrated on stock markets .",
    "cho et al . studied the 5-min return time series of 345 stocks traded on the taiwan stock exchange from 1998/01/03 to 1999/03/20 and reported a statistically and economically significant magnet effect for stock prices to accelerate towards the up - limit and weak evidence of acceleration towards the down - limit @xcite .",
    "hsieh et al . analyzed the transaction data of 439 stocks traded on the taiwan stock exchange in 2000 using logit models and found evidence of the magnet effect on both up - limt and down - limit @xcite .",
    "du et al . also observed the magnet effect when the stock prices are approaching the price limits in the korean market @xcite .",
    "the chinese stock markets also set price limits , which varied over time .",
    "the current @xmath0 price limits were fixed since 1996/12/16 for a - share common stocks .",
    "there are several studies conducted on the presence of the magnet or cooling - off effect . however , empirical results lead to controversial conclusions @xcite . according to the data released by the china securities regulatory commission , by june 2014 , there are 2540 listed companies and the total market capitalization is about 24.412 trillion chinese yuan . due to its huge capitalization and representativeness as an emerging market ,",
    "research on chinese stocks is of great importance and remarkable interest . in this work",
    ", we will perform detailed analyses on the statistical properties of variables associated with price limit hits and the pre - hit dynamics of important financial variables before limit hits in the chinese stock markets .",
    "these issues are less studied in previous works . to obtain conclusive results about the presence of a magnet or cooling - off effect in the chinese stock markets",
    ", one needs to adopt different methods proposed in the literature and consider possible evolution of the effect ( if present ) per se .",
    "we leave this topic in a future work .",
    "there are two stock exchanges in mainland china .",
    "the first market for government approved securities was founded in shanghai on 1990/11/26 and started operation on 1990/12/19 under the name of the shanghai stock exchange ( shse ) .",
    "shortly after , the shenzhen stock exchange ( szse ) was established on 1990/12/01 , and started its operations on 1991/07/03 .",
    "there are two separate markets for a - shares and b - shares on both exchanges .",
    "a - shares are common stocks issued by mainland chinese companies , subscribed and traded in chinese currency renminbi ( rmb ) , listed on mainland chinese stock exchanges , bought and sold by chinese nationals and approved foreign investors .",
    "b - shares are issued by mainland chinese companies , traded in foreign currencies and listed on mainland chinese stock exchanges .",
    "b - shares carry a face value denominated in rmb . the b - share market was launched in 1992 and was restricted to foreign investors before 2001/02/19 .",
    "it has been open to chinese investors since .",
    "the microstructure of the two markets has been changed on several aspects , such as the daily price up / down limit rules imposed since 1996/12/16 .",
    "the price limits are @xmath0 for common stocks and @xmath1 for specially treated ( st and st * ) stocks .",
    "we note that , before 1996/12/16 , there were also periods with different intervals of price limits or without price limits .    on each trading day , the trading time period is divided into three parts : opening call auction , cooling periods , and continuous double auction .",
    "the market opens at 9:15 a.m. and enters the opening call auction until 9:25 a.m , during which the trading system accepts order submissions and cancelations , and all matched transactions are executed at 9:25 a.m. this is followed by a cooling period from 9:25 to 9:30 a.m. during the cooling period , the exchanges are open to order routing from members , but does not accept the cancelation of orders .",
    "all matched orders are executed in real time .",
    "however , the information is not released to trading terminals during the cooling period and is publicly available at the end of the cooling period .",
    "the continuous double auction operates from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 13:00 to 15:00 ( for szse , 14:57 - 15:00 is a closing call auction period to form the close price ) and transaction occurs automatically by matching due to price and time priority .",
    "the time interval between 11:30 a.m. and 13:00 p.m. is a trade halt period . outside these opening hours",
    ", unexecuted orders will be removed by the system .",
    "our data sets were provided by resset ( http://resset.cn/ ) , which is a leading financial data provider supporting academic research .",
    "the data sets contain all common a - share stocks traded on the shanghai stock exchange and shenzhen stock exchange .",
    "the price limits for these stocks are @xmath0 . specially treated stocks with price limits of @xmath1 are not included in our analysis .",
    "the sample covers the period from 2000/01/04 to 2011/12/30 , totally 12 years . because the stocks have different initial public offering dates , the lengthes of stocks are not fixed .",
    "the quote frequency is about 5 seconds before 27 june 2011 and 3 seconds afterwards .",
    "due to different liquidities of the stocks , the quote frequencies of different stocks can be lower . for each stock",
    ", we have a unique stock code that is a sequence of six digital numbers , the trading time , the trading price , the trading volume , and the prices and standing volumes at the three best levels before 5 december 2003 or 5 levels afterwards on both the buy and sell sides of the limit order book .",
    "the records of stocks do not contain any indicator of price hits .",
    "hence , we need to identify when the price of a stock hits the up - limit or the low limit . because the tick size of all stocks is one cent ( 0.01 chinese yuan ) , no matter they have high prices or low prices",
    ", we are able to identify price limit hits . indeed , for each stock , we can determine the price up limit and price down limit for each trading day .",

    "the ssec index rose from 1406 on 2000/01/04 to its historical intraday high of 2242.4 on 2001/06/13 and since plummeted 32.2% to 1520.7 on 2001/10/22 .",

    "antibubble after the burst of the so - called new economy bubble in 2000 @xcite .",
    "the ssec index hit its all - time intraday low at 998.23 on 2005/06/04 during the time period investigated in this work .",
    "after that , a huge bubble formed and the index reached its historical intraday high at 6124.04 on 2007/10/16 , which was followed by a severe crash @xcite and the index plummeted to 1666.93 on 2008/10/28 as a all - time low since the crash .",
    "although the whole individual sentiment was bearish in the last six years , there was a mediate - size bubble started after 2008/10/28 and the index reached 3478.01 on 2009/08/04 . in summary ,",
    "the time period under investigation in this work can be divided into alternating periods of bullish and bearish states .",
    "the stock market was bullish during the three time periods : 2000/1/4 - 2001/6/13 , 2005/06/04 - 2007/10/16 , and 2008/10/28 - 2009/08/04 .",

    "however , it is hard to recognize bullish and bearish states for individual stocks and it is not irrational to make such a comparison based on the ssec index . we leave this more complicated stock - by - stock classification of bulls and bears in future research .      the empirical distribution of the number of limit hits for individuals is truncated on the left .",

    "the same - direction trade sizes @xmath184 have similar evolutionary trajectories in all the four cases , so do the opposite - direction trade sizes @xmath185 .",
    "we find that @xmath184 increases from @xmath186 to reach the local maximum at @xmath187 and then decreases till @xmath188 followed by a very large @xmath189 pushing the price to the limit , while @xmath185 decreases from @xmath186 to reach the local minimum at @xmath187 and then increases till @xmath188 , ended with @xmath182 . for all @xmath175 , we have @xmath190 , indicating that the pushing force of the same - direction traders is stronger than that of the opposite - direction traders .",
    "the trade size difference @xmath191 continuously increases and reaches its local maxima at @xmath187 and then decreases till @xmath188 .",
    "these findings also provide clues about the cooling down of the last three trades right before limit hits .",
    "the trade sizes @xmath184 are larger when the price is close to the up - limit than to the down - limit , which is true for both bullish and bearish periods .",
    "the trade sizes @xmath184 for the case of down - limit hits in bearish periods are relatively the lowest .",
    "the relative position of the four @xmath184 curves provides evidence of a well - known trait of chinese traders that they tend to buy rising stocks and hate to sell holding shares when the stock price drops .",

    "( a ) evolution of the logarithmic same - direction trade sizes @xmath184 ( the upper bundle ) and the logarithmic opposite - direction trade sizes @xmath185 ( the lower bundle ) for up - limit hits and down - limit hits in the bullish periods and bearish periods .",
    "( b ) evolution of the average trade - by - trade return @xmath192 .",
    "( c ) evolution of the average trade - by - trade volatility @xmath193 .",
    "( d ) evolution of the average bid - ask spread right before individual trades . for each financial quantity , we consider four cases , that is , up - limit hits in bullish periods , down - limit hits in bullish periods , up - limit hits in bearish periods , and down - limit hits in bearish periods.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as shown in fig .  [ fig : prehit:100trades:4quantities](a ) , the average size @xmath189 of the last trade that pushed the price to hit the limit is extraordinary larger than the size of any preceding trades .",
    "we show the empirical distributions of @xmath189 for the four cases .",
    "all the distributions are unimodal and have similar shapes .",
    "however , they have different peak heights .",
    "the peak is the highest for the case of up - limit hits in the bullish periods , the second largest for the case of up - limit hits in the bearish periods .",
    "we denote @xmath194 the transaction price of the @xmath175-th trade before the @xmath3-th limit hit , @xmath195 and @xmath196 the prices and standing volumes at the first @xmath197 price levels of the sell - side limit order book right before the @xmath175-th trade , and @xmath198 and @xmath199 the prices and standing volumes on the first @xmath197 price levels of the buy - side limit order book right before the @xmath175-th trade .",
    "the second financial variable investigated is the average trade - by - trade return which is defined as follows , @xmath200 figure [ fig : prehit:100trades:4quantities](b ) shows the evolution of average trade - by - trade return @xmath192 before price limit hits .",
    "it is found that @xmath192 increases superlinearly before @xmath175 close to 100 and then decreases sharply before up - limit hits in both bullish and bearish periods .",
    "almost symmetrically , @xmath192 decreases superlinearly before @xmath175 close to 100 and then increases sharply before down - limit hits in both bullish and bearish periods .",
    "these patterns are consistent with the behaviors of the average trade sizes , because large trade sizes usually cause large price movements @xcite .",
    "the third variable is the average trade - by - trade volatility which is defined as follows , @xmath201 figure [ fig : prehit:100trades:4quantities](c ) presents the evolution of average trade - by - trade volatility @xmath202 before price limit hits .",
    "the volatility @xmath202 before up - limit hits for both bullish and bearish periods is relatively stable when @xmath175 is less than about 50 , then increases rapidly to reach a maximum one or two trades before limit hits , and finally drops to some extent .",
    "about five trades before up - limit hits , the volatility is higher during bullish periods than in bearish periods .",
    "the volatility about 70 trades before down - limit hits is higher than that before up - limit hits and exhibits a mild decreasing trend .",
    "the volatility increases afterwards and decreases again around @xmath203 .",
    "the fourth variable investigated is the average bid - ask spread right before the @xmath175-th trade which is defined as follows , @xmath204 } , ~~ k= 1,2,3,\\cdots,100 .",

    "[ fig : prehit:100trades:4quantities](d ) , the four curves of the average bid - ask spread @xmath205 decrease before @xmath206 .",
    "the two spread curves for the bullish periods have very similar shapes .",
    "after the initial decrease , they increase during the next twenty trades or so and decrease again before the limit hits . for the curve associated with up - limit hits in bearish periods ,",
    "the spread increases continuously after @xmath207 .",
    "the comparison of the four curves is also quite intriguing .",
    "the spread before up - limit hits is narrower than that before down - limit hits , indicating higher liquidity before up - limit hits . on average ,",
    "the spread is the narrowest before up - limit hits in bearish periods and the widest before down - limit hits in bearish periods .",
    "stock markets are complex systems in which humans interact by buying and selling shares .",
    "the evolutionary trajectories of stock markets are fully determined by the behaviors of human being .",
    "it is widely accepted that people in emerging markets are less skilled and more irrational and thus these markets are much riskier . due to different factors such as imitation , global news , as well as collusive manipulation , traders may herd to push the price rise up or drop down rapidly in very short time intervals through positive feedback loops .",
    "such kind of collective behaviors might be caused partially by the somewhat reciprocity among a small amount of traders through price manipulation , which is reminiscent of the cooperation phenomena among human beings @xcite .    to cool off traders intraday mania to avoid the price deviating much from its fundamental value ,",
    "a number of stock exchanges pose price limit rules .",
    "empirical evidence is controversial about the presence of a magnet effect or a cooling off effect even for the chinese stock markets @xcite .",
    "our preliminary result on the price movement velocity favors the presence of an intraday cooling - off effect for both up - limits and down - limits in both bullish and bearish periods .",
    "the evolution of other financial variables such as trade size , trade - by - trade return , trade - by - trade volatility and bid - ask spread seems to support the conclusion that the traders are cooled off right before stock prices hit the price limits , as shown by the anti - trend behavior just before hitting the price limits .",
    "it is well documented that the limit order books are thin near price limits @xcite and thus the liquidity is worse . when the price is pushed towards its limit ,",
    "traders submit larger and larger orders and the price changes enlarge .",
    "however , the population of traders who place opposite orders to realize their gains or act as bottom fishers also increases . when the price is close to its limit , the force of opposite traders reverses the trends . in this sense ,",
    "the price limit rule works in the chinese stock markets .",
    "we have investigated the statistical properties of characteristic variables of up - limit and down - limit hits in bullish and bearish periods .",
    "we also uncovered nonlinear impacts of stock capitalization on price limit hits by comparing six portfolios sorted due to stocks capitalization on the daily level .",
    "it is intriguing to find that price continuation occurs more frequently than price reversal on the next trading day after a limit - hitting day .",
    "this effect is more significant for down - limit hits .",
    "the empirical probability of next - day price continuation is thus far greater than 50% .",
    "our empirical findings have potential practical values for market practitioners .",
    "for instance , it will be probably profitable to buy shares at the close price in a up - limit hitting day and sell the share at the opening of the next trading day , or to sell the shares one holds in a down - limit hitting day ."
