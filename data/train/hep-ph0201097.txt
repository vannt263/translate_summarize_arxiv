    "superconducting cosmic strings are topological defects  @xcite that may be formed at a phase transition in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "contrary to their usual counterpart known as goto - nambu strings  @xcite , these possess a nontrivial internal structure because of conserved currents that can flow along them  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of superconducting cosmic strings is , because of the current structure that has to be taken into account , much more complicated . in order to describe their evolution , the so - called elastic string formalism ,",
    "thanks to which the micro - structure can be integrated over to yield the macroscopic behavior , was set up by carter  @xcite .",
    "the only requirement is the knowledge of the equation of state relating the energy per unit length to the string tension .",
    "this is equivalent to giving a single lagrangian function @xmath0 , depending on a so - called state parameter @xmath1 , out of which the dynamical equations can be derived .",
    "various macroscopic lagrangians for describing superconducting cosmic strings have been proposed  @xcite , that correspond to different assumptions about the internal structure . in principle , the current along a cosmic string exists because some extra degrees of freedoms ( e.g. particles  @xcite ) are trapped in the defect core . up to now",
    ", there are essentially three models that have been developed to yield analytic equations of state .",
    "those can be called respectively transonic , bosonic and zero mode fermionic carrier models .",
    "the transonic model describes for instance wiggly goto - nambu strings  @xcite .",
    "the trapped degrees of freedom in this case are not particles , but rather transverse string excitations that play the same role .",
    "it is self - dual , meaning that the equation of state algebraic form does not depend on whether the current is timelike or spacelike , and it is transonic because the velocities of transverse and longitudinal perturbations happen to be equal . among its numerous advantages",
    ", one finds that the transonic model can be exactly solved in the case of flat space , and the string loop motion in this model is always stable .",
    "it also describes the motion of an ordinary string in a five - dimensional space - time , _  la _ kaluza - klein  @xcite . in this last case",
    ", the state parameter represents the fifth coordinate of the string location , seen by projection in the four dimensional space - time .",
    "superconducting cosmic string may also involve actual particles , the simplest case being that of fermions trapped in the defect core in the form of zero modes , as originally proposed in 1985 by witten  @xcite to introduce superconductivity .",
    "under very general circumstances , the fermion condensate can be shown  @xcite to rapidly reach a zero temperature distribution , so that the integrated model does not depend on anything else but the string characteristic mass scale , @xmath2 say .",
    "the relevant equation of state in this case is then again self - dual , with the energy per unit length and tension adding up to a constant at all times .",
    "bosonic current - carrying cosmic strings are described by an equation of state which is not self - dual .",
    "such models require two different masses  @xcite : the string scale @xmath2 and a mass characterizing the current , @xmath3 say , usually taken to be that of the carrier itself .",
    "such models have been examined with full details  @xcite . even though a bosonic condensate can be treated as a single classical field , contrary to it fermionic counterpart ,",
    "the corresponding strings look rather more involved than the fermionic current - carrying ones .",
    "indeed , it turned out that two equations of state are required to describe bosonic current - carrying cosmic strings , one for each of the available regime , namely spacelike or timelike .",
    "what previous analysis revealed is that even in this case , quantum effects should be taken into account , due to various possible instabilities that could be triggered by the loops evolution  @xcite .",
    "there are results on the evolution of superconducting string loops in one and two dimensions  @xcite for those equations of state corresponding to strings with bosonic currents .",
    "these works have shown the appearance of various singular behaviors as the dynamical evolution can drive parts of a given loop outside of the domain of validity of the elastic string description . for instance , the loop can develop shocks  @xcite or fold on itself in complicated shapes .",
    "the first question that could then be asked regarding these effects is how much of these is due to the restriction to one or two dimensions  ?",
    "in other words , are these results real or do they merely arise because of some projection effect . in the present paper , we have accordingly extended previous studies to the simulation of a superconducting cosmic string loop with bosonic currents in three dimensions .",
    "we find that all the singular behaviors observed in two dimensions generalize to three and can not therefore be assigned to some projection artifact .",
    "furthermore , we also investigated the behavior of a loop with fermionic currents , using what was recently shown to be the relevant equation of state for such strings  @xcite , i.e. the fixed trace model .",
    "in this case , although dynamical evolution can also drive the loop outside of the domain of validity of the elastic string description and fold it in complicated shapes , shocks never develop .",
    "all these singular behaviors , both for fermionic and bosonic carriers , are interesting because , they are expected to lead to charge carrier emission , a mechanism that has many cosmological consequences .    the dynamics of the string loops under consideration in this paper demands to be applied to a network  @xcite of such strings in order to decide on important issues such as vorton formation  @xcite and evolution  @xcite",
    ". another related possibility concerns the up - to - now mysterious highest energy cosmic ray events  @xcite .",
    "these could be explained in terms of topological defects such as superconducting cosmic strings , and indeed there have been many such proposals  @xcite .",
    "in the case at hand , our conclusions seem to imply that much more particles are released during the normal evolution of a current - carrying cosmic string loop than during that of an ordinary loop . assuming these particles to have enough energy to contribute to the highest energy cosmic ray",
    ", this paves the way to a new class of models that may not suffer from the normalization constraint  @xcite .",
    "the article is articulated as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive the equations of motion in three dimensions , and express them in an appropriate way for efficient numerical resolution . in section  iii , we present the equations of state for superconducting cosmic strings with bosonic and fermionic currents , while the results of the simulation are exhibited in section  iv . for a loop with a bosonic current ,",
    "we exemplify cases where the loop develops shocks , kinks or folds on itself in much the same way as in the two dimensional case .",
    "the analysis is then extended to superconducting loops with fermionic zero - mode current - carriers . in this case , we find that in some instances , the loop shows regions of discontinuous curvature ( kinks ) but we do not find shock waves as in the bosonic situation .",
    "we also observe that in most of the cases we have investigated , the dynamical evolution of a loop , whether with bosonic or fermionic current , will drive it out of the elastic regime .",
    "this is yet another confirmation that the quantum ( microscopic ) effects that are taking place in a cosmic string loop are almost always not negligible , and even more so in the cosmological setting for which those effects might modify drastically the model predictions  @xcite .",
    "we discuss this particular point in the concluding section .",
    "for a current  carrying cosmic string , the equations of motion can be expressed as the conservation of the stress energy tensor and the equation of state .",
    "the stress energy tensor of a cosmic string can be expressed in diagonal form as  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two orthogonal , respectively timelike and spacelike unit eigenvectors , @xmath7 , which describe the string worldsheet , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the two corresponding eigenvalues identified respectively with the energy per unit length and tension of the string .",
    "the equations of motion stem from the conservation of the stress energy tensor , and they can be split into two pairs of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamical equations .",
    "the intrinsic dynamical equations are obtained by projection along the string worldsheet while the extrinsic dynamical equations are obtained by projection perpendicular to the string worldsheet .",
    "the intrinsic equations reduce to two current conservation laws , one timelike @xmath10 and the other spacelike @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative on the string worldsheet , obtained by projecting the usual covariant derivative on the worldsheet with the projection operator @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined through the relations @xmath16 and can be understood , respectively , as a number density variable and its associated effective mass variable or chemical potential .",
    "the intrinsic equations can be equivalently re - expressed as irrotationality equations , respectively as @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the antisymmetric tangent element tensor of the string worldsheet , given by @xmath20 in terms of the tangent vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    for a superconducting cosmic string",
    ", the conserved numbers associated with the two conserved currents correspond to the charged current trapped in the string and the winding number of the string .",
    "when a loop is considered , these translate into two integer - valued charges , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , say , once integration around the loop is performed .",
    "the extrinsic equations of motion can be written as@xmath25 where @xmath26 , defined by @xmath27 is the orthogonal projection operator .",
    "the necessary quantities for describing a cosmic string loop are completed by the knowledge of two other important parameters , namely the speeds of transverse and longitudinal perturbations along the string , written respectively as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and given by @xmath30 these velocities are useful to explore the stability of a loop at equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they are helpful since they allow us to define what we call elastic regime : the string dynamics is in the elastic regime if transverse and longitudinal perturbations are stable .",
    "this indeed ensures that the dynamical model does not break down .",
    "the velocities  ( [ cs ] ) should also be asked to both be less than unity in order to avoid superluminal propagation , but this , in practice , never actually happens so that it is not really a constraint . to summarize , we require that , along the loop trajectories , we have @xmath31 constraints that are not always trivially satisfied .",
    "we now have to fix the gauge to determine unambiguously the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamical equations are solved numerically choosing as unknowns the string worldsheet coordinates @xmath32 as in  @xcite , and as parameters @xmath33 , the time coordinate , and @xmath34 , a spacelike curvilinear coordinate chosen as the potential associated with the irrotationality equation ( [ eiro1 ] ) . with this choice , @xmath35 and @xmath14 are expressed as : @xmath36 with dots and primes respectively denoting derivatives with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and we have adopted the following definitions @xmath37 the equation of motion ( [ eiro1 ] ) is automatically satisfied by the choice of its associated potential @xmath34 as variable , and the remaining equations of motion ( [ eiro2 ] ) and ( [ eero ] ) become respectively @xmath38 = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the spatial part of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 = 0,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 the spatial parts of two independent quadrivectors orthogonal to the worldsheet , which we are choosing as @xmath42 and @xmath43 then , the equations of motion can be solved to find that @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfy @xmath46 where the functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by :    @xmath51 , \\\\",

    "we shall assume in what follows that the dynamics obtained by means of the numerical solution is accurate as long as both these quantities are conserved at least at the few @xmath59 level ( worst case during the development of a shock ) all along the trajectory .",
    "the equation of state describes the substructure of the current  carrying cosmic string considered by relating its internal parameters , for instance its energy density and tension .",
    "there are three interesting current  carrying cosmic string models : the transonic model and the bosonic and fermionic superconducting models .",
    "the transonic model is used to describe the macroscopic dynamical behavior of a wiggly `` goto  nambu '' cosmic string and carries a current associated with the wiggles  @xcite : it permits to neglect the dynamics of the strings on small scales by integrating over these scales , effectively raising the stress - energy tensor degeneracy , and thereby to introduce an effective current .",
    "this model also possesses the nice feature of being algebraically solvable in flat space  @xcite , and thus can provide useful analytical examples with which one can compare the accuracy of a simulation code .",
    "the other models we shall deal with are used to describe cosmic strings in which a current of particles ( either bosonic or fermionic ) has condensed .    for superconducting strings with a bosonic current ,",
    "the model requires two mass scales , namely the cosmic string mass scale @xmath2 , which is the string forming symmetry breaking energy scale , and @xmath3 which is the mass scale of the current carrier . in this case , one can write down two different equations of state depending on whether the conserved current along the string is timelike or spacelike  @xcite .",
    "these two regimes of the model are called respectively electric and magnetic in accordance with the situation where the current is coupled to an electromagnetic field  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "in this case , a timelike current would induce an essentially electric field ( in the sense that , as @xmath60 , the magnetic component can be framed away ) , while a spacelike current leads to a magnetic - like field . using a toy model which produces such strings  @xcite ,",
    "the equation of state for u as a function of t in the magnetic regime is  @xcite @xmath61 and the transversal and longitudinal speeds are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", @xmath64 can become negative so that the string may become unstable with respect to longitudinal perturbations and thus leave the domain of elasticity . in the electric regime ,",

    "the final model of current - carrying cosmic strings which we shall consider here concerns the case in which fermions may be bound to cosmic strings in the form of two lightlike currents of zero modes propagating in opposite directions .",
    "the resulting total fermionic current can then be timelike , spacelike or lightlike . because the fermion condensate tends to a zero temperature distribution , the equation of state is self - dual , that is of the same form whether the fermionic current is timelike or spacelike , given by  @xcite @xmath70 which gives @xmath71 where @xmath2 is , as before , the string scale . here",
    ", the perturbation velocities are simply @xmath72 in this case , the string can leave the domain of elasticity only if the velocity of transverse perturbations @xmath69 can become negative , i.e. if @xmath73 .",
    "we shall see that this indeed happens .",
    "we studied the evolution of loops in three dimensions after having reproduced , as a check , exactly the two - dimensional results of ref .",
    "then , the evolution of loops in three dimensions was investigated with the various superconducting equations of state discussed above .",
    "the class of initial configurations with which we have been concerned was obtained by perturbing the circular equilibrium solution in the following way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively the current and the lorentz factor of the circular equilibrium solution , @xmath77 is the ellipticity of the configuration , @xmath34 is the spacelike coordinate , chosen to vary from zero to @xmath78 using the gauge freedom in the worldsheet , @xmath79 is a dimensionless parameter which measures the deviation in velocities from the circular equilibrium state obtained when @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is an integer phase parameter for the transverse @xmath83 motion . note that the amplitude @xmath84 of the perturbation in the transverse ( with respect to the string loop plane ) direction , and that of the associated velocity @xmath85 are independent since those perturbations have been shown  @xcite to be absolutely stable .    for a given equation of state , the stability of the perturbed circular equilibrium solution can easily be derived  @xcite . the primary purpose of this work is to find out the fate of the unstable configurations . before studying such configurations within the framework of bosonic and fermionic superconducting equations of state , we first checked the program against stable ones with the transonic equation of state . in this case , everything runs smoothly and there is nothing particular to note about the loops dynamics .",
    "thus , no evolution of transonic loops is shown ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of these configurations ; the three dimensional simulation now presented merely confirms this reference results as we were able to check that they were not artifacts of the two dimensional projection ) .",
    "more interesting is the case of the bosonic current where singular dynamics where observed in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis in this case is presented next .",
    "it is then followed by an investigation of the fermionic current case which is completely new .      for superconducting strings with bosonic currents",
    ", we confirm that all the singular behaviors observed in two dimensions , i.e. , shocks in the magnetic regime , kinks in the electric regime , folding loops and exit from the elastic regime in general , persist in three dimensions  ; they are not projection artifacts and represent the real physical time evolution of superconducting cosmic string loops . in the following ,",
    "we show examples that illustrate each case in turn .",
    "a shock wave may be formed at points along the string worldsheet , and according to previous results @xcite we further confirm that a shock can only take place in the magnetic regime .",
    "an example of such a shock in three dimensions , using equation of state ( [ magneticut ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ shock ] on which is also represented the space variations of the state parameter @xmath86 for different instants in time for a transversely perturbed loop with @xmath87  ; note that such a loop , from the transverse perturbation point of view , should be strictly stable . in this case , the geometric evolution does not reveal any visible change in the loop , but the time evolution of the state parameter @xmath88 as a function of the @xmath34 parameter shows the development of shock fronts along the string worldsheet . at these points",
    "the current in the string becomes discontinuous and the code can not handle the evolution anymore , as shown for instance by the fact that the total energy is no longer conserved .",
    "although such transverse modes in principle would have been expected to be stable , it turns out , with the values of the parameters chosen , that nonlinear effects rapidly become dominant , effectively coupling the transverse mode to the longitudinal one . that this really occurs is made clear by the fact that the number of shock fronts generated during this evolution is @xmath89 , thus directly related to the phase parameter @xmath82 .     along the string worldsheet for an elliptic configuration of a loop with a bosonic current in the magnetic regime , having large ellipticity @xmath90 and velocity parameter @xmath91 , and with a phase parameter @xmath87 ( and @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "in the last panel the variation of the energy shows two important things . on the one hand",
    "the small peaks in the graph are an evidence that the loop size decreases because the initial velocity has been reduced . on the other hand , nearly at the end of the simulation , the rare variation of the energy gives a signal of the shocks produced along the loop string .",
    "the relative variation of the total energy , shown on the last panel , is still rather small even as the simulation reaches its very end .",
    "the situation is similar for the angular momentum , and the simulation eventually breaks down .",
    "[ shock],width=321 ]    another important effect that may take place along a superconducting loop is the appearance of kinks .",
    "these are regions where the curvature of the string becomes discontinuous . we found that giving an extra dimension for the loop to evolve into did not suppress the appearance of kinks .",
    "[ kink1 ] shows the evolution of a loop in the electric regime , and therefore using the equation of state given by eq .",
    "( [ electricut ] ) . in this case",
    "again , the simulation shows that @xmath89 kinks are being formed at points along the loop . to illustrate this point further , we plotted in fig .",

    "the effects found in the two dimensional planar case are still present in three dimensions .",
    "they are however usually affected ( or even initiated ) by the transverse perturbation in @xmath83 .    ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath92 ( @xmath98 ) .",

    "a systematic analysis shows that a loop in three dimensions tends to fold on itself in any regime , magnetic or electric .",
    "this is similar to what happens to goto - nambu loops for which it was even argued that this intercommuting process could be the leading process for a string network to loose energy  @xcite .",

    "the behavior in this case follows somewhat that observed in the bosonic case : the loop can fold on itself and leave the elastic domain .",
    "we shall exemplify both cases in turn , but first let us remark the important following point . since in the fermionic case the equation of state is self - dual , there can not be any qualitative difference between the magnetic and the electric regimes at the level of the equations of motion .",
    "however , the two perturbation velocities are not equal and the string may become unstable only with respect to transversal perturbations . as a result ,",

    "fermionic strings , being described by an equation of state for which only the squared transverse perturbation velocity can become negative , are subject only to the possibility of building kinks , and this in a way that is independent of the spacelike or timelike nature of the underlying current since the relevant equation of state is self - dual .    in both cases ,",
    "fermionic and bosonic currents , and for whatever kind of current , the loops tend to fold on themselves , generating contact points where intercommutation should occur",
    ". the almost systematic occurrence of such configuration leads us to conclude that one may divide superconducting string loops into essentially two species : those loops which tend to divide into smaller loops , and the other ones that are identified with the proto - vortons of other authors  @xcite .",
    "our results tend to indicate that the latter category is much less populated than the former , as was already postulated in earlier investigations  @xcite .",
    "it also implies that these intercommutations will be , in the case of superconducting cosmic strings , much more frequent than in the case of ordinary strings .",
    "now when a string loop self - intercommutes , the topological stability that confines the higgs and other particles inside the defect is raised and some of these particles are expelled away .",
    "although stable while contained in the defects , these particles are often unstable .",
    "in particular , strings are expected to form at the grand unified ( gut ) scale , and the relevant higgs and gauge fields to decay therefore almost instantaneously by cosmological standards .",
    "these particles will then initiate showers of lower mass ones dividing the original energy .",
    "this is the mechanism that is at work in most top - down scenarios  @xcite of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) whose origin is still mysterious  @xcite .",
    "ordinary cosmic strings do not produce much of these particles , because intercommutations are not that frequent in goto - nambu strings since most of the energy of the network in that case is expected to be lost through gravitational radiation  @xcite . in fact",
    "@xcite , the resulting flux is found a disappointing ten orders of magnitude below the observed one . in the case of current - carrying strings ,",
    "loops have a higher probability of self - intercommuting , so the mechanism is enhanced accordingly .",
    "the proto - vorton case now takes us to the rare configurations that do not intercommute frequently . note at this point that the scarcity of these states is not enough to ensure the vorton excess problem to be altogether alleviated",
    ". indeed , for gut scale vortons , the ratio between proto - vortons and doomed loops should already be much less than @xmath110 in order for the present - day vortons not to dominate the universe  @xcite if the resulting vortons are stable over cosmologically relevant timescales .",
    "gathering all the results obtained over the recent years , we now find the following : for a realistic underlying microscopic model , the equation of state is such that at least one of the perturbation propagation speed can become imaginary , leading to possible instabilities . the main result of",
    "the present paper is to show that these instabilities will systematically develop in every loop as it evolves . as a result",
    ", the elastic treatment turns out to be valid for limited periods of time and one must resort to the full microscopic description in between .",
    "the elastic description breaks down in two possible ways , namely through the formation of kinks or shocks . in both cases ,",
    "the meaning is that the microstructure should be taken into account . in particular , close to these points",
    ", it is no longer appropriate to consider the string as effectively two dimensional and we must consider the effects that are due to the finite thickness .",
    "first of all , kinks can not exist if the string is a tube instead of a dirac line as it would be impossible for instance to match the higgs field and its derivatives , as is however required by the underlying field theory , at the points where the curvature is discontinuous .",
    "therefore , the string must somehow find a way of smoothing , which means in that context loosing energy .",
    "the only non kinematical ( in the sense of necessarily breaking the elastic description ) way of realizing that is through particle emission , and we are led to conclude that , as in the case of intercommutation , but for completely different reasons , some particles ( current carriers , but also higgs and gauge fields ) will be radiated away as the kinks develop .",
    "note also that the current - carrier is indeed likely to get out of the string since , as the string curvature increases , the carrier momentum acquires an orthogonal - to - the - worldsheet component thanks to which the wavefunction is spread over larger distances , thereby effectively increasing the probability for the particle to tunnel out .",
    "this mechanism can ease the vorton excess problem while in the same time providing more efficiency for uhecr production through top - down scenarios .",
    "shocks develop only for bosonic spacelike currents . in this case , the state parameter @xmath14 , which would end up being discontinuous were the shock actually occurring , is well represented by the collective momentum of the trapped particles  @xcite , this momentum being always less than the rest mass of the carrier particles themselves in order for the confinement to take place . as we argued before  @xcite , it is rather dubious that actual shock could form in cosmic strings , as the shocks are always accompanied , either followed or preceded , by a transient region in which @xmath111 .",
    "however , in this region , the momentum of the carrier is higher or at least of the same order as its rest mass .",
    "therefore , it is energetically favored to some of the trapped particles to move out of the string .    in all the situations which we have studied",
    ", we found that the expected dominant effect was particle radiation .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion that an elastic treatment of cosmic strings is not completely appropriate .",
    "it should be supplemented with some semi - classical , non conservative , forces .",
    "the dissipative effect then introduced can serve to ease the vorton excess problem , while providing new interesting ways to produce uhecr .",
