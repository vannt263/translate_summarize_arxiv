    "the existence of an important cold dark matter ( cdm ) component has been firmly established by cosmological observations in the last few years notably by sdss  @xcite and wmap  @xcite . a leading candidate for cdm",
    "is a new weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "this wimp must be stable .",
    "such particles arise naturally in many extensions of the standard model  @xcite from the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite to models of extra dimensions  @xcite , little higgs models  @xcite or models with extended gauge  @xcite or higgs sectors  @xcite . in these models",
    "the dark matter ( dm ) candidate can be either a majorana fermion , a dirac fermion , a vector boson or a scalar .",
    "their masses range anywhere from a few gev s to a few tev s .",
    "astroparticle experiments are actively pursuing searches for wimp dm candidates either directly through detection of elastic scattering of the wimp with the nuclei in a large detector or indirectly trough detection of products of dm annihilation ( photons , positrons , neutrinos or antiprotons ) in the galaxy or in the sun .    in direct detection ,",
    "one measures the recoil energy deposited by the scattering of wimps(@xmath0 ) to designate the dm candidate whether a fermion , scalar or vector boson . ] with the nuclei .",
    "generically wimp - nuclei interactions can be split into spin independent ( scalar ) and spin dependent interations .",
    "the scalar interactions add coherently in the nucleus so heavy nuclei offer the best sensitivity .",
    "on the other hand , spin dependent interactions rely mainly on one unpaired nucleon and therefore dominate over scalar interactions only for light nuclei unless scalar interactions are themselves suppressed . in both cases ,",
    "the cross - section for the wimp nuclei interaction is typically low , so large detectors are required .",
    "many experiments involving a variety of nuclei have been set up or are being planned .",
    "detectors made of heavy nuclei ( for example germanium or xenon ) currently in operation include edelweiss  @xcite , dama  @xcite , cdms  @xcite , xenon  @xcite , zeplin  @xcite , warp  @xcite and kims  @xcite .",
    "upgrades and new projects such as genius , xmass  @xcite , clean  @xcite , ardm  @xcite and eureca  @xcite have been proposed as well .",
    "detectors made of light nuclei which are sensitive mainly to the spin dependent interaction include simple  @xcite , picasso  @xcite , tokyo / naf  @xcite and naiad  @xcite .",
    "the latter having one light ( na ) and one heavy ( i ) target nuclei is actually sensitive to both spin - dependent(sd ) and spin - independent(si ) interactions .",
    "larger versions of existing detectors and new projects are also proposed , for example those operating with @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "note that heavy nuclei although best for probing the scalar interaction have also a sensitivity to spin dependent interactions because of their odd - a isotopes .",
    "currently the sensitivity of both types of detectors for spin dependent interactions is similar .",
    "furthermore , different nuclei offer a sensitivity to spin dependent interactions on protons ( for odd - proton nuclei such as @xmath2na , @xmath3i or @xmath4f ) or neutrons ( for odd - neutron nuclei such as or @xmath5si @xmath6ge,@xmath7xe ) .",
    "only one experiment , dama , has reported a positive signal consistent with an annihilation cross - section @xmath8 pb for a wimp mass around 30 - 100 gev  @xcite .",
    "other experiments , such as edelweiss , cdms , or xenon have only set an upper limit on the wimp - nucleon annihilation cross - section .",
    "the best limits were reported recently by xenon , @xmath9 pb for a wimp mass around 30 gev  @xcite and by cdms , @xmath10 pb for a wimp mass around 60 gev @xcite .",
    "these values already probe a fraction of the parameter space of the most popular cdm candidate , the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  @xcite or some of its extensions  @xcite and poses severe constraints on a model with a dirac right - handed neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the search for wimps will continue with larger detectors ( around 100 kg ) planning to reach a level of @xmath11  pb by 2010 . by 2015 , improved large detectors , around 1 ton , should go below the @xmath12  pb level , for example warp , xenon , eureca  @xcite or supercdms  @xcite . for spin dependent interactions , the limits for neutrons from zeplin  @xcite and cdms  @xcite",
    "have recently been superseded by xenon  @xcite , @xmath13  pb , while for protons the best limit from direct detection experiments was set by kims , @xmath14pb  @xcite .",
    "indirect detection experiments looking for an excess of muon neutrinos from wimp annihilations such as super - kamiokande have also set a stringent limit on the wimp proton cross section , @xmath15  pb  @xcite .",
    "these limits are at the level or below the positive signal reported by dama  @xcite",
    ".    the calculation of the cross - section for wimp scattering on a nucleon have been obtained at tree - level for different dm candidates : neutralinos in supersymmetry(for reviews see  @xcite,@xcite ) , gauge bosons in ued models  @xcite or in little higgs models  @xcite , right - handed neutrinos  @xcite or scalars  @xcite . implications of the direct detection experiments on dm models have been explored for quite some time  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "the most complete calculation of the neutralino nucleon scattering is the one of drees and nojiri  @xcite that includes higher - order effects from twist-2 operators .",
    "public codes for dm in the mssm such as darksusy  @xcite and isajet  @xcite both follow this approach for calculating neutralino nucleon scattering . on the other hand , ,",
    "a code primarily designed for the calculation of dm relic abundance did not , up to now , provide a module for the computation of the direct detection rate even though an improved tree - level computation within the mssm has been performed for some time  @xcite .",
    "this is the gap we intend to fill .",
    "here we describe the implementation of the direct dm detection rate within .",
    "many ingredients enter the calculation of the direct detection rate and cover both astroparticle , particle and nuclear physics aspects .",
    "we need to know the wimp density and the velocity distribution near the earth .",
    "since the wimp have small velocities , it means that the momentum transfer , @xmath16 , is very small as compared to the masses of the wimp and/or nuclei .",
    "the detection rate depends of course on the wimp nucleus cross section .",
    "to arrive at the @xmath0-nucleus cross section one has to first compute the interaction at the more fundamental level , that is at the quark level .",
    "the different matrix elements for @xmath17 interactions that capture the dynamics of the model in a perturbative way have to be converted into effective couplings of wimps to protons and nucleons .",
    "finally we have to sum the proton and neutron contribution and turn this into a cross section at the nuclear level .",
    "the recoil spectrum of the nuclei depends on the velocity distribution and , in view of the low @xmath16 , is contained in the elastic form factor of the nucleus . in this manual",
    ", we describe all these steps . even though many of these steps are not new , it is necessary to understand how all the pieces are implemented in the code .",
    "an important point to emphasize is that , contrary to other public codes , is not restricted to the supersymmetric model with a neutralino dm but is applicable to a generic model of new physics for dm  .",
    "we have already in previous versions set up the code so that any model can be implemented to give the relic density of dm , the indirect detection rate and cross - sections relevant for collider applications . in the same spirit",
    ", the calculation of direct dm detection rate in nuclei is also performed for generic models of dm .",
    "more precisely the tree - level cross - section is computed in any model and dominant qcd corrections are taken into account .",
    "other higher order corrections such as the threshold corrections to higgs quark vertices are model dependent and are provided only for the mssm and its extensions ( cpvmssm , nmssm ) .",
    "the steps that go from the automatic computation of the cross - section for wimp scattering on quarks to a detection rate in a large detector follow standard approaches  @xcite . in the spirit of the modular approach of , different nuclear form factors or wimps velocity distribution can easily be implemented by the user .",
    "the paper is organised as follows , we first review the computation of the scattering rate for dm on a point - like nucleus starting from an effective lagrangian for nucleon - wimp interactions .",
    "we then show in section 3 how to relate these to the quark- wimp interactions and describe the method used to reconstruct the effective lagrangian for both scalar and spin dependent interactions .",
    "we also describe the treatment of dominant qcd corrections .",
    "the computation of the recoil distribution for wimps scattering on nuclei taking into account nuclear form factors and velocity distribution of wimps follows in section 4 .",
    "the functions available in this new module are described in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to sample results and comparisons with other codes .",
    "the treatment of box diagrams is described in appendix a and some details about nucleus spin dependent form factors are gathered in appendix b.",
    "the standard formalism for evaluating wimp nuclei cross sections was reviewed in  @xcite with special emphasis on the case of the neutralino dm .",
    "here we first describe the calculation of dm elastic scattering on point - like nuclei taking the majorana fermion as an example then consider different types of dm candidates .",
    "the relation with the scattering rates on quarks , computed automatically in our code will be presented in the next section .",
    "the velocity of dm particles near the earth should be of the same order as the orbital velocity of the sun , @xmath18 .",
    "because of this small velocity , the momentum transfer is very small as compared to the masses of the wimp and/or nuclei . for example for typical masses of wimp , @xmath19  gev and of nuclei , @xmath20  gev , the maximum transfer momentum is @xmath21 thus all wimp nucleon elastic cross sections can be calculated in the limit of zero momentum transfer .",
    "the cross sections for scattering on nuclei are obtained from the wimp nucleon cross sections after folding in the nuclei form factors , these form factors depend on the momentum transfer .      in the non - relativistic limit , wimp - nucleon",
    "elastic amplitudes can be divided into two classes , the scalar or spin independent interaction and the axial - vector or spin dependent interaction . for a spin 1/2 nucleon",
    ", interactions corresponding to multipole will clearly vanish in the zero momentum limit . in the familiar case of a majorana fermion",
    ", the effective lagrangian reads  @xcite @xmath22    in the zero momentum transfer limit the operator @xmath23 vanishes while only the space component of @xmath24 and the time component of @xmath25 remain .",
    "thus the operators @xmath26 are suppressed in the limit of small momentum transfer by factors of order @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "we will ignore these operators .",
    "therefore only one operator survives in each class , @xmath30 for si and @xmath31 for sd .",
    "of course in a specific model it is possible that the coefficient @xmath30 is much smaller than one of the coefficients @xmath26 , in which case the operator @xmath26 may contribute at the same level as @xmath30 despite the @xmath16 suppression .",
    "however in this case we expect very small rates , much below the experimental sensitivities .",
    "* spin independent interactions * + for @xmath32 interactions with nucleons the effective lagrangian thus reads    @xmath33    where @xmath34 . the squared amplitude for a nucleon after averaging ( summing ) over",
    "the polarization of incoming ( outgoing ) particles is , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the nucleon mass .",
    "scalar and vector wimp - nucleon interactions naturally induce scalar and vector wimp - nuclei interactions .",
    "summing on proton and neutron amplitudes gives for wimp - nucleus interaction at rest , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the nucleus charge and @xmath39 the total number of nucleons .",
    "it leads to the cross section for a wimp scattering at rest from a point - like nucleus @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the wimp - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath42 .",
    "note that the nucleon cross - section adds coherently so that there is a strong enhancement for large nuclei , @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "* spin dependent interactions * + the effective lagrangian for spin dependent interactions of a majorana fermion at zero momentum transfer reads @xmath45 it leads to the squared amplitude @xmath46    in order to get the amplitudes for nuclei we have to sum the spin currents produced by the protons and neutrons separately . since we know that the spins of protons with the same orbital state should be opposite , we expect strong compensation of currents produced by protons as well as those produced by neutrons .",
    "first note that for interactions at rest , the @xmath47 component of the pseudovector current , eq .  [ neutralino_sd_lgrgn ] , vanishes .",
    "the resulting interaction @xmath48 leads to a three dimensional vector current .",
    "this vector current has to be proportional to the angular momentum @xmath49 .",
    "we can write for nuclei @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the expectation value of the spin content of the nucleon n in a nucleus with a nucleons . by definition , for protons and neutrons @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the second peculiarity of the @xmath54 case is a non - trivial summation over spins . because the matrix element is proportional to @xmath55 the summation over spin states in a nucleus gives a factor @xmath56",
    "here we use @xmath57 for labelling polarization states and @xmath58 refers to the angular momentum of a nucleus with @xmath39 nucleons . after averaging over initial polarizations , a factor @xmath59 will cancel out .",
    "taking into account the spin currents structure ( [ spin_currents ] ) and the @xmath49 dependence ( [ j_dependence ] ) we can write the wimp - nucleus squared amplitudes as @xmath60 this reduces to eq .",
    "[ sq_sd_amplitude ] in the special case of the nucleon and leads to the cross section at rest for a point - like nucleus  @xcite , @xmath61    the quantities @xmath51 are obtained from nuclear calculations or from simple nuclear models , such as the odd - group model .",
    "they are estimated to be @xmath62 for a nuclei with an odd number of protons or neutrons and @xmath63 for an even number .",
    "thus no strong enhancement is expected for sd interactions in nuclei .",
    "the treatment of the nuclei form factors taking into account the momentum dependence will be discussed in section 5.2 .      to derive the formulae for elastic scattering on point - like nuclei , we started from the effective wimp - nucleon lagrangian ( [ neutralino_si_lgrgn],[neutralino_sd_lgrgn ] ) written for a majorana wimp .",
    "in fact these can be generalized to all types of wimps . our aim it to give the generic form of the effective lagrangians for a fermionic , scalar and vectorial wimp including the possibility of complex fields . in all cases",
    "we define the effective lagrangian such that the normalization conditions ( [ sq_si_amplitude],[sq_sd_amplitude ] ) are satisfied . here",
    "we write only operators that contribute at @xmath64 .",
    "as we have argued for majorana fermions , other operators are suppressed by @xmath65 and can potentially be of the same order as the operators we consider only when both contributions to the scattering cross section are small .",
    "note that in the case of a complex field , @xmath0 and @xmath66 have in general different cross - sections . for each type of interaction ,",
    "si ( sd ) one can then construct two operators , one that is even with respect to @xmath67 interchange , @xmath68(@xmath69 ) and is the only remaining operator for majorana s and another that is odd , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .    for a fermion field",
    "the most general lagrangian reads @xmath72 this lagrangian leads to matrix elements which satisfy the normalization conditions eq .",
    "[ sq_si_amplitude]([sq_sd_amplitude ] ) with @xmath73 where the @xmath74 signs correspond to wimp ( anti - wimp ) interactions .",
    "the special case of a self - conjugated wimp such as the majorana fermion is recovered when @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "note the factor 2 difference between the operator for majorana and dirac fermion field , compare eq .",
    "[ neutralino_si_lgrgn ] and eq .",
    "[ fermion_si_lgrgn ] .",
    "note that the antisymmetric tensor @xmath78 current effectively reduces to a vector interaction since in the non - relativistic limit only the spatial components contribute .    for a scalar field",
    "only si interactions are possible , for the general case of a complex scalar , @xmath79 the squared amplitude is normalized as for majorana fermions , ( [ sq_si_amplitude ] ) , with the condition ( [ eq : odd - even ] ) for complex scalars . again",
    "the case of the real scalar corresponds to @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that the four - dimensional vector current @xmath82 actually leads to a scalar interaction because only the zeroth component of this current does not vanish in the non - relativistic limit .    finally for a complex vector field , @xmath83 with in the special case of a real vector field @xmath84 .",
    "again the couplings are normalized as for the fermion case both for real ( [ sq_si_amplitude ] , [ sq_sd_amplitude ] ) and complex fields ( [ eq : odd - even ] ) .    in",
    "we assume that dm particles and anti - particles have the same density .",
    "we do not consider the case where this symmetry is broken by cp violation . under this assumption ,",
    "the event rate for wimp scattering in a large detector is obtained after averaging over @xmath0- and @xmath85-nucleus cross - sections .",
    "the matrix elements for wimp nucleon interactions are related to the more fundamental matrix elements for wimp quarks interactions .",
    "these matrix elements can be easily written in a given model . to handle a generic model",
    "we rather expand wimp quark interactions over a set of basic point - like operators .",
    "only a few operators are necessary in the @xmath86 limit .",
    "the operators that are non - zero in the non - relativistic limit are similar to the operators introduced for nucleons in eq .",
