    "the most important chemical transitions for quasar absorption line systems at low redshift ( e.g. , @xmath0@xmath11 ) still lay in the ultra - violet spectral range .",
    "a limited number of the most uv - bright quasars have been observed with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst_)/ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , which has provided a detailed view of absorption systems along the lines of sight .",
    "these data are available from the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) . however , in order to compile statistics of absorbers or to study particular systems , it is necessary to identify the spectral features .",
    "this can be complicated , particularly in the forest region , and when the available spectral coverage is limited .",
    "in the course of our studies of the forest and metal - line systems we have studied in detail eight of the highest quality _",
    "spectra , obtained with the e230 m grating . in this paper we present these spectra with a list of @xmath2 absorption features and our suggested line identifications .",
    "in particular , metal - line system identifications are necessary in order to remove contaminants from the forest . in a recent paper @xcite , we measured statistics of absorption in the forest at @xmath3 using 74 low resolution _",
    "quasar spectra . as a check , and particularly to assess our ability to separate metal lines from the forest , we also used the available higher resolution e230 m _",
    "hst_/stis spectra . in the present paper ,",
    "we present the relevant data and line identifications which were used in that paper .",
    "we expect that this catalog will facilitate future studies of metal - line absorption systems as well as of the forest .",
    "our catalog includes damped absorbers ( dlas ) , lyman limit systems , and forest clouds .",
    "the dla and lyman limit systems are expected to have strong absorption @xcite , while the forest clouds may have weak and other low ionization transitions detected ( such as and ) @xcite .",
    "some forest clouds have detected and/or , without associated low ionization absorption @xcite .",
    "the catalog that we will present will allow for future studies of the various types of absorbers .    in   [ sec :",
    "data ] we describe _",
    "quasar spectra and our reduction and continuum fitting procedures .",
    "we also outline our line detection and measurement algorithms and line identification strategies .",
    "the normalized echelle spectra are presented in   [ sec : results ] , along with a brief description of metal - line systems detected toward each quasar .",
    "system plots , showing all detected transitions for each system , are also presented there . in   [ sec : summary ] we present a general summary of the systems presented in this catalog .",
    "we selected the eight @xmath4 quasars observed with the _",
    "e230 m grating which had a signal to noise ratio , @xmath5 , over a reasonable fraction of the spectrum .",
    "hst_/stis e230 m spectra have a resolution @xmath6 , with two pixels per resolution element .",
    "our sample is biased towards quasars that have lyman limit systems , since most of the stis observations were conducted in order to study those particular known systems in detail .",
    "several settings are possible covering different wavelength ranges . for seven of the eight quasars in our sample , @xmath7 - @xmath8   is covered .",
    "the quasars and the relevant observational details are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] . specifically , this table lists quasar redshifts , wavelength coverage , @xmath9 per pixel at 2350   and 2750   , primary investigator for the original observation , and proposal i d .",
    "the data were reduced using the stis pipeline @xcite .",
    "they were combined by simple weighting by exposure time ( as in @xcite ) , rather than by , e.g. , inverse variance methods that are often employed .",
    "a bias could be introduced by the latter method , since pixels with smaller counts would be weighted more heavily .",
    "this bias is significant only in cases such as these stis spectra , where individual exposures have very small @xmath9 , and is not typically important for reduction of ground - based high resolution echelle spectra .",
    "wavelengths were corrected to the heliocentric reference frame . when the same quasar was observed multiple times",
    ", there was often a small shift in wavelength between the spectra , due to the intentional shifting of the echelle angle of the instrument . in this case , we chose not to smooth the data by interpolating , but instead chose wavelength bins from one exposure and combined the flux from other exposures into the nearest bin .",
    "this results in a slightly decreased effective resolution .",
    "continuum fits used the standard iraf sfit task .",
    "features were objectively identified by searching for an unresolved line at each pixel ( as employed in @xcite ) , and applying a @xmath10 criterion for detection .",
    "however , we found by inspection that some of these formal detections are not likely to be real . in some cases , only 1 pixel had significant absorption , and in other cases it appeared that correlated noise biased the measurement .",
    "features that are broad and shallow can be @xmath11 5@xmath12 and yet look unconvincing because they are sensitive to the continuum level .",
    "such spurious features , estimated to be 10% of the total number of detections , were eliminated from consideration .",
    "we define a feature as all the pixels around a 5@xmath12 detection that have not recover to the continuum after smoothing the spectra using an equation on p.56 of @xcite .",
    "this definition means that many features are clearly blends of well separated lines , and hence a feature can have more than one identification , each of which may be secure because they refer to different blended lines .",
    "wavelength that we give for a feature is the flux - weighted central value , the mean of the wavelengths where the smoothed flux drops below the continuum , with weighting for the fraction of the photons that are absorbed at each pixel .",
    "we attempted to identify all features in each of the quasar spectrum , and the transitions that were identified one or more times are listed with their vacuum wavelengths and oscillator strengths in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . for our line identification we used the following procedure :    1 .",
    "examine the spectrum at the expected positions of possible galactic lines , and mark all possible detections .",
    "search for the strong resonant doublet transitions : mg0.1emii  @xmath13 , si0.1emiv  @xmath14 , c0.1emiv  @xmath15 , , and o0.1emvi  @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to these , we also search for low ionization gas through the combination  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 , which can be used in place of mg0.1emii  @xmath13 when the latter is not covered @xcite .",
    "check positions of other transitions that could be detected for systems found through the doublet search , including the lyman series lines . if a system is ambiguous with the doublet alone , and other lyman series lines were used to assess its reality .",
    "4 .   having completed these steps , all features that remain without plausible identifications are considered to be lyman series lines .",
    "begin by assuming that the highest order lyman series line is the correct identification and search for all of the stronger ( lower order ) lyman series lines corresponding to the same redshift .",
    "if reasonable ratios are found , mark these as possible identifications . otherwise continue assessing the possible identifications of the feature in question until reaching .",
    "if no identification , including a identification , is plausible the feature is left unidentified .",
    "7 .   if more than one identification is reasonable ( or if there is likely to be a blend for which more than one system contributes significantly ) , this is noted .",
    "figure  1a is a sample of a portion of the normalized spectrum of pg@xmath19 , shown in the printed version .",
    "we present all other normalized quasar spectra in figures  1b8d ( see the complete version ) , which are available electronically at http://www.blackwellpublishing.com / products/. similarly , our listings of line identifications are presented electronically in table  [ tab : tab3 ] , with some sample listings appearing in the printed version . in this table , quasars are ordered by right ascension and @xmath10 features by increasing wavelength within a given quasar entry . in table",
