    "a submanifold @xmath0 in some symplectic manifold @xmath1 is called lagrangian if @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a simple example is given by the zero section @xmath4 in the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold @xmath5 , and this is universal in the sense that a neighborhood of any lagrangian embedding of a closed @xmath5 into some symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "lagrangian submanifolds play a fundamental role in symplectic geometry and topology , as many constructions and objects can be recast in this form .",
    "in fact , already in a 1980 lecture ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , a. weinstein formulated the `` symplectic creed '' :    _ everything is a lagrangian submanifold .",
    "_    today , lagrangian submanifolds ( sometimes decorated with additional structures ) are for example studied as objects of the _ fukaya category _ , which plays a fundamental role in kontsevich s formulation of homological mirror symmetry . rather than delving into such general theories ,",
    "i want to concentrate here on a quite simple , and in fact basic , question :    _ which closed , oriented @xmath7-manifolds admit a lagrangian embedding into the standard symplectic space @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ? _    an excellent introduction to this question , containing a discussion of some of the relevant classical algebraic topology , as well as early results obtained by holomorphic curve methods , is @xcite , which i will quote freely .    for @xmath10",
    "there is not much to say , since @xmath11 is the only connected closed 1-manifold , and the lagrangian condition @xmath12 is trivial in this case . in general , a necessary condition for an oriented closed manifold @xmath13 to admit a lagrangian embedding into @xmath14 is that its euler characteristic @xmath15 should vanish .",
    "this is because the self - intersection number of any submanifold of @xmath14 is clearly zero , but it is also equal to the euler characteristic of the normal bundle , which for lagrangian submanifolds is isomorphic to the cotangent bundle .",
    "so for @xmath16 , the only orientable closed manifold that could have a lagrangian embedding into @xmath17 is @xmath18 , and it embeds e.g. as the product of one circle in each @xmath19-factor . for non - orientable",
    "closed surfaces @xmath20 , classical algebraic topology implies that a necessary condition for the existence of a lagrangian embedding is that @xmath21 is divisible by 4 , and a beautiful construction by givental  @xcite shows that for strictly negative euler characteristic this is also sufficient .",
    "the embedding question was only recently completely answered , when shevchishin showed that the klein bottle does not have a lagrangian embedding into @xmath17 ( @xcite , see also @xcite for an alternative argument by nemirovski ) .    already for",
    "@xmath22 , elementary algebraic topology does not tell us much .",
    "it was one of the many important results in gromov s landmark paper  @xcite to show that there are no exact lagrangian embeddings into @xmath23 , in the sense that any global primitive @xmath24 of the symplectic form @xmath25 has to restrict to a non - exact closed 1-form on the lagrangian submanifold @xmath26 .",
    "this in particular rules out @xmath27 , but of course there are plenty of closed orientable 3-manifolds with @xmath28 .    all of this and more is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this chapter is to show how knowledge about string topology can be applied to give a far - reaching refinement of gromov s result .",
    "in particular , i aim to present the overall strategy for proving the following result :    ( fukaya)[thm : fukayamain ] let @xmath5 be a compact , orientable , aspherical spin manifold of dimension @xmath7 which admits an embedding as a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath14 . then a finite covering space @xmath29 of @xmath5 is homotopy equivalent to a product @xmath30 for some closed @xmath31-manifold @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is the centralizer of some element @xmath34 which has maslov class equal to 2 and positive symplectic area .",
    "the assertion about the maslov class is known as _ audin s conjecture _ , and was originally asked for tori in @xmath14 , see @xcite .",
    "the spin condition is a technical assumption ( it is needed to make the relevant moduli spaces of holomorphic disks orientable ) , and i expect that it can be removed by reformulating the argument somewhat . the asphericity assumption ( meaning that all higher homotopy groups of @xmath5 vanish ) enters the proof in a fairly transparent way , and one can imagine various replacements .    as a corollary , we obtain the following more precise statement in dimension 3 .",
    "( fukaya)[cor : fukaya1 ] if the closed , orientable , prime 3-manifold @xmath5 admits a lagrangian embedding into @xmath35 , then @xmath5 is diffeomorphic to a product @xmath36 of the circle with a closed , orientable surface .",
    "the fact that the product @xmath36 does embed as a lagrangian submanifold into @xmath35 follows from an elementary construction , see e.g.  @xcite . basically , one starts from an isotropic embedding of @xmath20 into @xmath35 , e.g. by embedding it into the lagrangian subspace @xmath37 .",
    "then one uses the fact that a small neighborhood necessarily is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero section in @xmath38 , the direct sum of the cotangent bundle with a trivial symplectic vector bundle of rank 2 , to embed the product @xmath36 by taking the product of the zero section in @xmath39 with a standard small @xmath40 .",
    "the above statements are special cases of a more general result discovered by kenji fukaya , and first described in @xcite , see also @xcite . as with most results involving @xmath41-holomorphic curves , the underlying idea can be traced back to misha gromov s foundational paper @xcite .",
    "his proof of the fact that there are no exact compact lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath14 contains an important seed for fukaya s arguments . therefore , after discussing some aspects of moduli spaces of holomorphic disks in the next section , i begin section  [ sec : main ] by sketching gromov s argument , followed by the discussion of an instructive example and the statement of fukaya s refinement ( theorem  [ thm : blackbox ] ) . in a nutshell , fukaya s important observation was that the compactification of the moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with boundary on a lagrangian submanifold @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of string topology operations , in particular the loop bracket ( and possibly also its higher analogues at the chain level ) .    after an interlude section on basic properties of l@xmath43 algebras ,",
    "i describe how theorem  [ thm : fukayamain ] is a fairly straightforward consequence of theorem  [ thm : blackbox ] .",
    "corollary  [ cor : fukaya1 ] will follow by using specific facts from 3-dimensional topology . before finishing with a guide to the literature ,",
    "i discuss a few further small observations .    at the moment of this writing , full proofs of",
    "the above theorems are not available yet .",
    "one would like to construct a chain model @xmath44 for the free loop space of the manifold @xmath5 with the loop bracket operation @xmath45 ( and higher operations as necessary ) , such that @xmath46 is an l@xmath43-algebra .",
    "moreover when this model is considered with coefficients in a suitable novikov ring , the compactified moduli spaces of holomorphic disks should give rise to an element in this chain complex satisfying the maurer - cartan equation in this l@xmath43-algebra .",
    "so the principal problem is that the apparent freedom one has in building the chain model is severely constrained by the need to make it fit with the analysis of holomorphic disks , which in particular involves delicate transversality and gluing issues .    in this text",
    ", i will largely ignore the technical difficulties , by stating the key results as black boxes .",
    "the main tool in our study of lagrangian embeddings @xmath47 will be moduli spaces of holomorphic disks with boundary on @xmath5 . before introducing the relevant spaces",
    ", i will briefly review some standard notions .",
    "the first of these is the _ maslov index _ of a loop of lagrangian subspaces in @xmath14 .",
    "the lagrangian grassmannian @xmath48 is defined as the space of all lagrangian subspaces of @xmath49 .",
    "standard symplectic linear algebra shows that a real @xmath7-dimensional subspace @xmath50 is lagrangian if and only if it is orthogonal with respect to the standard euclidean inner product to @xmath51 , its rotation by @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , any orthonormal basis of a lagrangian subspace is a unitary basis of @xmath14 , and conversely the real linear span of a unitary frame is a lagrangian subspace .",
    "since @xmath53 acts transitively on the unitary frames generating the same lagrangian subspace , one concludes that @xmath48 can be identified with @xmath54 .",
    "the map @xmath55 which associates to a unitary matrix the square of its determinant induces a well - defined map @xmath56 , and for any loop @xmath57 we define _ its maslov index _ as @xmath58 clearly @xmath59 so defined is an invariant of the free homotopy class of @xmath60 . moreover , one can check that @xmath61 induces an isomorphism @xmath62 .    now given a lagrangian immersion @xmath63 , any loop @xmath64 determines a loop in @xmath48 , simply by taking the loop of tangent spaces of @xmath5 at the image points of @xmath60 . in this way , we get a maslov index @xmath65 discussions of the maslov index can be found in various texts , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . in particular , it is easy to see that for a lagrangian immersion of an oriented manifold @xmath5 , the maslov index takes values in @xmath66 .",
    "another useful notion is the _ area _ or _ energy _ of a disk @xmath67 with boundary on a lagrangian submanifold @xmath68 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath69 and one easily checks that it only depends on the free relative homotopy class of @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , just observe that given a homotopy @xmath71 \\times d , [ 0,1 ] \\times { { \\partial}}d ) \\to ( { { \\mathbb{c}}}^n , l)$ ] with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 \\times { { \\partial}}d } h^*\\omega = 0\\ ] ] by the assumption that @xmath5 is a lagrangian submanifold . in particular , @xmath75 descends to a homomorphism @xmath76 .",
    "finally , in order to discuss holomorphic curves , we introduce the relevant spaces of almost complex structures .",
    "generally , an _ almost complex structure _",
    "@xmath41 on some manifold @xmath77 is an automorphism of the tangent bundle @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath77 carries a symplectic form @xmath80 , then an almost complex structure @xmath41 on @xmath77 is said to be _ tamed by _",
    "@xmath80 , if @xmath81 for all nonzero tangent vectors @xmath82 .",
    "in other words , @xmath80 is a positive area form on each 1-dimensional @xmath41-complex subspace of each tangent space .",
    "it is a standard result that these @xmath80-tamed almost complex structures form a contractible ( in particular non - empty ) space .",
    "given such a tamed @xmath41 , one can define a riemannian metric on @xmath77 by setting @xmath83 one can also define the notion of a @xmath41-holomorphic map @xmath84 from some riemann surface @xmath85 to @xmath77 , simply by asking that it satisfy the usual cauchy - riemann equations with respect to the given @xmath41 : @xmath86 in local conformal coordinates @xmath87 on the riemann surface this can be written equivalently as @xmath88 in riemannian geometry , the @xmath89-energy of a map @xmath90 is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath61 is any volume form on @xmath20 and @xmath92 denotes the operator norm of @xmath93 with respect to the metric @xmath94 on @xmath20 and the metric @xmath95 on @xmath77 .",
    "the integrand turns out to be independent of the choice of @xmath61 , as any scaling factor also appears in the operator norm with opposite exponent .",
    "now the importance of the taming condition stems from the following crucial fact : suppose @xmath96 is @xmath41-holomorphic , and we have chosen local conformal coordinates @xmath97 on @xmath20 . then at @xmath98 we have @xmath99 so that @xmath100 in particular , for @xmath41-holomorphic disks",
    "@xmath101 , the energy as defined above , which was a purely topological quantity , is the same as the usual @xmath89-energy of the map @xmath70 .",
    "choose an almost complex structure @xmath41 tamed by the standard symplectic structure @xmath25 on @xmath14 . given a relative homotopy class @xmath102",
    ", we consider the set @xmath103 = a \\in \\pi_2({{\\mathbb{c}}}^n , l)\\}.\\ ] ] the real 2-dimensional group @xmath104 of biholomorphisms of the disk fixing @xmath105 acts on @xmath106 by precomposition , and the quotient @xmath107 is called the moduli space of holomorphic disks in the class @xmath108 .    the reader should take note that in the literature moduli spaces of holomorphic curves are almost universally denoted by @xmath109 , usually with some decoration , and the precise meaning of the symbol should very carefully be checked in each case .",
    "the equation defining @xmath106 is elliptic , and so the linearization is a fredholm operator . the index theorem for holomorphic curves , as discussed for example in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) , implies that the index of this operator , and hence the expected dimension of the moduli space @xmath106 , is @xmath110 .",
    "the assignment @xmath111 can be viewed as a section of a suitable banach space bundle . under favourable circumstances this section",
    "can be arranged to be transverse to the zero section , in which case its zero set @xmath112 is a manifold of the expected dimension . in general",
    ", this is a serious technical difficulty beyond the scope of the present discussion , and resolving it requires substantial work .",
    "note that , for @xmath113 , the action of @xmath114 on @xmath106 is free .",
    "so , assuming that we can arrange transversality , we conclude that @xmath115 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath116 as shown by examples in @xcite , one generally needs the spin condition on @xmath5 to be able to orient the moduli spaces @xmath115 .    for several reasons the individual spaces @xmath115 tend to not be very useful for proving anything interesting about @xmath5 ( with the notable exception of theorem  [ thm : gromov - notexact ] ) .",
    "the first is that these spaces strongly depend on @xmath41 , as simple examples show .",
    "[ ex : nosol ] consider @xmath117 and the relative homotopy class @xmath118 which has degree 1 in the first factor and degree 0 in the second .",
    "given any real number @xmath119 , consider the almost complex structure @xmath120 on @xmath17 given by the matrix @xmath121 if @xmath122 ranges in some interval @xmath123 , then all the @xmath120 are tamed by the symplectic form @xmath124 on @xmath125 .    now for the standard split complex structure @xmath126 on @xmath17 , the moduli space @xmath127 is clearly non - empty , since for any @xmath128 the map @xmath129 defines an element in it .    in general",
    ", given any @xmath120-holomorphic map @xmath70 in the class @xmath108 , note that the projection @xmath130 onto the first @xmath19-factor is holomorphic in the usual sense , and since it has degree 1 it will be a biholomorphism .",
    "so , precomposing with a suitable element of @xmath114 , we may assume that this projection @xmath130 is just a rotation by @xmath131 .",
    "a short computation shows that in this case for @xmath70 to be @xmath120-holomorphic , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath132 now if @xmath133 is a solution of this equation , then @xmath134",
    "so for @xmath135 the moduli space @xmath136 is empty .",
    "the phenomenon discussed in this example is a crucial ingredient in the proof below of gromov s theorem  [ thm : gromov - notexact ] .    a second , related complication is the failure of compactness , a simple instance of which is described in example  [ ex : noncompact ] below",
    ". both of these apparent problems can be overcome by considering the collection of all @xmath137 at once . in the next subsection",
    ", i briefly discuss the compactness issue .",
    "gromov s compactness theorem , in its modern formulation , asserts that every sequence of holomorphic curves of fixed topology and uniformly bounded energy , whose images lie within a compact subset of the target , has a subsequence converging in a suitable sense to a limiting `` stable curve '' .",
    "a proof in text book form for holomorphic spheres was given by mcduff and salamon  @xcite , and an exposition of gromov s proof for the higher genus case was written up by hummel  @xcite .",
    "the case of curves with boundary is for example discussed by liu as part of her ph.d .",
    "thesis  @xcite . for holomorphic disks with lagrangian boundary conditions the precise statement and proof",
    "were worked out in u.  frauenfelder s diploma thesis , published as @xcite .    here",
    ", i will describe the statement under the simplifying assumption that the target symplectic manifold @xmath1 is exact , i.e. @xmath138 , as in the case of my main example @xmath139 .",
    "this assumption in particular implies that there are no non - constant holomorphic spheres in @xmath140 , and so the possible limiting configurations are much more restricted than in the general case .",
    "basically , all the stable curves arising as gromov limits will be stable trees of disks , as explained presently .",
    "recall that a _ tree _ is a ( finite ) set @xmath141 together with an edge relation @xmath142 satisfying the following conditions :    * ( symmetric ) * if @xmath143 then @xmath144 .    *",

    ", for a given @xmath41 , all the moduli spaces appearing in the compactification @xmath256 were transversely cut out , one could hope to prove a _ gluing theorem _ , asserting that in fact the compactified moduli space is a manifold with boundary and corners .",
    "this is generally too much to ask . in @xcite , fukaya , oh",
    ", ohta and ono describe a procedure to put a so - called _ kuranishi structure _ on the compactified moduli spaces . without going into details , this",
    "roughly means that these spaces admit fundamental chains _ that make them function as if they were manifolds with corners_. theorem  [ thm : blackbox ] below should be understood in this sense .",
    "presumably , the ongoing polyfold project of hofer , wysocki and zehnder ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) will eventually lead to an alternative approach to the problem of putting enough structure on the compactified moduli space to prove a statement like theorem  [ thm : blackbox ] .",
    "as already mentioned , it is instructive to review the proof for the following well - known theorem of gromov .",
    "[ thm : gromov - notexact ] if a compact manifold @xmath5 admits a lagrangian embedding into @xmath14 , then @xmath265 .",
    "( sketch ) i sketch the proof of this theorem given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9.2 ) , slightly rephrasing the end of the argument in order to make the relation to the following discussion even more apparent .",
    "fix a lagrangian embedding @xmath47 , and choose a vector @xmath266 with @xmath267 .",
    "consider the set @xmath268 \\times d \\times { { \\mathbb{c}}}^n)$ ] of hamiltonian functions such that @xmath269 the idea is to consider , for a fixed @xmath270 , the moduli space @xmath271 of maps @xmath272 satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath273 for some @xmath274 $ ] , and * the relative homotopy class @xmath275 \\in \\pi_2({{\\mathbb{c}}}^n , l)$ ] vanishes .",
    "so for @xmath276 , we are considering holomorphic disks with boundary on the lagrangian @xmath5 , and since the relative homotopy class vanishes , these are precisely the constant maps",
    ". note that we do not divide out any automorphisms here , since for positive @xmath24 these have no reason to preserve the solution space to the equation .",
    "one can prove that for fixed small @xmath277 , there is still a compact @xmath7-dimensional family of solutions .",
    "in fact , for generic choice of the hamiltonian @xmath278 , standard transversality techniques show that @xmath271 is a smooth @xmath279-dimensional manifold , whose boundary consists of those elements with @xmath280 .",
    "on the other hand , a straightforward computation as in example  [ ex : nosol ] shows that , for our choice of @xmath108 , there are no solutions to the equation with @xmath281 .",
    "so if @xmath271 was compact , it would give a smooth cobordism from @xmath5 to the empty set .",
    "now consider the evaluation map @xmath282 from what we said above , the boundary of this @xmath283-chain in the free loop space of @xmath5 is the cycle of constant loops",
    "@xmath284 \\in c_n(\\lambda l)$ ] .",
    "since this cycle is nontrivial in homology , @xmath271 can not be compact .",
    "it follows from elliptic regularity theory ( cf .",
    "* theorem 4.1.1 ) ) that if compactness fails , there is a sequence @xmath285 such that @xmath286 as @xmath287 .",
    "appropriately rescaling such a sequence and applying removal of singularities as in @xcite , one finds either a nonconstant holomorphic sphere or a nonconstant holomorphic disk with boundary on @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath14 does not contain nonconstant holomorphic spheres ( such spheres would be contractible and have positive energy , contradicting stokes theorem ) , the only possibility is the existence of some nonconstant holomorphic disk @xmath288 .",
    "now the standard symplectic form @xmath289 is positive on all complex lines in @xmath14 , and hence on all the tangent planes to the image of @xmath82 , so we have @xmath290 moreover , @xmath291 , where e.g. @xmath292 , and so stokes theorem implies that @xmath293 on the other hand , the lagrangian condition states that @xmath294 vanishes pointwise when restricted to @xmath5 . combining these observations , it follows that @xmath295 is a closed 1-form representing a nonzero class in @xmath296 , and this proves the theorem .",
    "what was the essence of the proof of gromov s theorem ?",
    "basically , the point is that the space @xmath271 has a single boundary component , corresponding to the space of constant disks , and hence for topological reasons it can not be compact .",
    "analysing the breakdown of compactness , we found holomorphic disks .",
    "the elements of @xmath271 do not appear to be holomorphic curves , due to the nonzero right hand side @xmath297 of the equation .",
    "however , they can in fact be viewed as holomorphic maps into @xmath298 with respect to a family of almost complex structures which have an off - diagonal term built out of this right hand side , projecting holomorphically and with degree 1 to the disk .",
    "this basic phenomenon was already present in example  [ ex : nosol ] .",
    "the stable map compactification in this particular case is given by bubble trees of disks with exactly one main component , satisfying the original equation , and all other bubbles being strictly holomorphic ( in the graph picture just mentioned , each of these has constant projection to the disk ) .",
    "fukaya s insight was to see that the new boundary can be described in terms of string topology operations .",
    "namely , for each @xmath102 , consider the compactified moduli space @xmath299 of holomorphic disks in the relative homotopy class @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath300 the space of solutions @xmath301 to the equation @xmath302\\ ] ] in the relative homotopy class @xmath102 .",
    "pretending as always that transversality holds , this space is a manifold of dimension @xmath303 and we denote its compactification by @xmath304 .    assuming the analysis can be made to work ,",
    "both @xmath305 and @xmath304 can be thought of as chains on @xmath306 , simply by associating to each map of the disk its restriction to the boundary circle .",
    "in fact , for @xmath307 there is a slight ambiguity , since its elements are only well - defined up to precomposition by @xmath308 .",
    "but one can easily get around this point , for example by replacing the actual map by a parametrization proportional to arc length .    to arrive at a clean statement , i will introduce some further notation .",
    "suppose we are given a suitable model @xmath44 for the chains on the free loop space of @xmath5 with coefficients in @xmath309 , such that for each @xmath310 the compactified spaces @xmath305 and @xmath304 , with their respective evaluation maps to @xmath306 , define elements in it .",
    "note that @xmath306 is a disjoint union over its connected components @xmath311 , which can be identified with conjugacy classes @xmath60 of elements of @xmath312 .",

    "a more careful analysis reveals that , on the level of boundary values of the holomorphic maps , these configurations correspond to loop brackets @xmath335 with @xmath336 .    [ ex:2torus ]",

    "( of theorem  [ thm : fukayamain ] ) recall that the maurer - cartan element @xmath558 is built from the moduli spaces @xmath559 , which have geometric dimensions @xmath560 and the element @xmath561 is built from the spaces @xmath562 with geometric dimensions @xmath563 denote by @xmath564 the homology with respect to the usual boundary operator of @xmath324 .",

    "the l@xmath43 structure on @xmath324 pushes forward to an l@xmath43 structure on @xmath564 under a homomorphism @xmath568 , and by proposition  [ prop : pushforward ] , this homomorphism maps the elements @xmath122 , @xmath158 and @xmath284 $ ] in @xmath324 to elements @xmath569 , @xmath570 and @xmath284 $ ] in @xmath564 satisfying the equation @xmath571}.\\ ] ] writing @xmath572 the part of this equation corresponding to the trivial relative homotopy class can be written more explicitly as @xmath573}.\\ ] ] since the homomorphism between the l@xmath43 structures preserves degrees , the geometric degrees of @xmath574 and @xmath575 are @xmath576 and @xmath577 , respectively .    by the assumption that @xmath5 is aspherical , corollary  [ cor : top3 ] implies that the homology @xmath564 is concentrated in geometric degrees @xmath578 . combining this observation with and the fact that the maslov index is even for orientable lagrangian submanifolds @xmath5 , we find that for the term @xmath579 to be nonzero we must have @xmath580 the first equation immediately implies that @xmath61 is not identically zero .",
    "moreover , if @xmath581 for all @xmath582 , it follows that @xmath583 , again contradicting the first equation .",
    "thus we conclude that some @xmath584 with @xmath585 must be nonzero , implying that the corresponding moduli space is nonempty .",
    "so @xmath586 is represented by a holomorphic disk , and hence must have positive symplectic energy .",
    "set @xmath587 and let @xmath588 denote the centralizer of @xmath60 .",
    "notice that we have a short exact sequence @xmath589 in which the last map admits an inverse sending @xmath222 to @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that the map @xmath590 , defined by @xmath591 , is an isomorphism ( @xmath592 is indeed a group homomorphism because @xmath60 commutes with all elements of @xmath402 ) . since @xmath5 is a @xmath593 , the covering space @xmath29 of @xmath5 with @xmath594 is a @xmath595 , so it is homotopy equivalent to @xmath30 for a @xmath596 space @xmath32 .    to complete the proof of the theorem , it remains to show that @xmath32 is closed or , equivalently , that @xmath597 is a finite covering space .",
    "note that the class @xmath586 with @xmath598 had the property that @xmath585 , and moreover @xmath574 is a nonzero element of geometric degree @xmath7 in @xmath564 .",
    "so the homology in degree @xmath7 of @xmath599 must be nonzero . but combining lemma  [ lem : top1 ] and lemma  [ lem : top2 ] , we see that @xmath311 is homotopy equivalent to the @xmath7-manifold @xmath600 .",
    "the nonvanishing of its top - dimensional homology now implies that @xmath29 is closed , which in turns means that @xmath597 is a finite covering space .",
    "the more precise statement in dimension 3 can be proven with some specific results from 3-dimensional topology .",
    "i wish to thank k.  fukaya , k.  honda and s.  maillot for helpful correspondence , which lead to the following proof of corollary  [ cor : fukaya1 ] .",
    "( of corollary  [ cor : fukaya1 ] ) let @xmath5 be a compact , orientable , prime 3-manifold .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that either @xmath601 or @xmath5 is irreducible , meaning that every embedded two - sphere in @xmath5 bounds a ball in @xmath5 .",
    "if an irreducible 3-manifold @xmath5 admits a lagrangian embedding into @xmath35 , then by gromov s theorem  [ thm : gromov - notexact ] it has infinite first homology , and hence infinite fundamental group , and so its universal cover @xmath29 is non - compact .",
    "moreover , by the sphere theorem ( see @xcite ) , an irreducible 3-manifold has trivial second homotopy group .",
    "it follows that @xmath602 for @xmath413 , and so by hurewicz s theorem @xmath603 for @xmath449 , implying that @xmath5 itself is aspherical .",
    "now by theorem  [ thm : fukayamain ] , a finite cover of @xmath5 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath36 for some closed oriented surface @xmath20 , and a result of waldhausen  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.5 ) implies that this homotopy equivalence can be improved to a homeomorphism .",
    "recall from the proof above that the fundamental group @xmath402 of the cover arises as the centralizer of an element @xmath604 with @xmath605 .",
    "now i will argue that in fact @xmath60 is central in @xmath312 , so that the covering projection is actually a homeomorphism .",
    "indeed , consider the exact sequence @xmath606 where @xmath607 .",
    "since the centralizer @xmath402 of @xmath60 is of finite index , @xmath608 is of finite index in @xmath609 . from the above proof of the theorem",
    ", we see that @xmath610 is finitely generated ( it is the fundamental group of @xmath20 ) , so @xmath609 is also finitely generated .",
    "then by stallings fibration theorem ( @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  11.6 ) ) , we deduce that @xmath609 is the fundamental group of a compact surface @xmath611 , which under our current assumptions must be closed of genus at least 1 .",
    "now the proof concludes with the following observation :    any automorphism @xmath612 of the fundamental group @xmath609 of a closed oriented surface which is trivial on some finite index subgroup @xmath610 is trivial .",
    "if the surface is a sphere there is nothing to prove , so we consider the case that the genus of the surface is at least 1 .",
    "one knows that the fundamental group @xmath609 of a closed surface has no torsion .",
    "let @xmath613 be given and consider the infinite cyclic subgroup @xmath614 generated by @xmath537 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath615 contains the finite index subgroup @xmath616 , on which @xmath612 acts trivially . but any automorphism of an infinite cyclic group fixing some nontrivial subgroup must be the identity , so @xmath617 .",
    "since this applies to any @xmath613 , the lemma is proven .",
    "applying the lemma to the action of @xmath60 on @xmath609 by conjugation , which clearly fixes all elements of @xmath618 , we finally conclude that @xmath60 is central in @xmath312 , so that @xmath619 , which finishes the proof of the theorem .",
    "above , i have presented fukaya s elegant arguments leading to some substantial new results about lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath14 . at first glance",
    ", it seems that string topology is really essential to the approach .",
    "however , on further inspection , one discovers that there may be a way to avoid it almost entirely .",
    "the basic idea is the following . by viterbo s theorem ( see @xcite and chapter chap : viterbo ) , the homology of the free loop space can be described in symplectic terms as the symplectic homology of the cotangent bundle .",
    "this theory can be defined in more general situations , for example for exact symplectic manifolds with contact - type boundary . moreover , for _ exact _ codimension 0 embeddings @xmath620 one has restriction maps @xmath621 .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect ( and is the subject of current work ) that every algebraic structure that exists on the homology of the free loop space can also be defined on symplectic homology in general , even if the underlying domain is not a cotangent bundle . in the exact case",
    ", the restriction homomorphism should respect all these structures .",
    "but even more should be true . in the case of a non - exact embedding @xmath620",
    ", there will be a maurer - cartan element in @xmath622 such that after twisting all the structures by this maurer - cartan element we get a morphism from @xmath623 to the twisted version @xmath624 .",
    "this expectation is consistent with ( and gives one of several possible conceptual explanations for ) the results of fukaya for lagrangians in @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , with @xmath625 being a small neighborhood of the zero section in the cotangent bundle of @xmath5 and @xmath626 , we are exactly in the situation just described .",
    "what i have argued in earlier sections is that , after twisting by a maurer - cartan element coming from the embedding , the unit @xmath284 \\in h_*(\\lambda l)$ ] with respect to the loop product has become exact , which by a standard argument will force the twisted homology to vanish completely .",
    "this is good news , because only in this case can we even expect to have a morphism from @xmath627 to this ring .",
    "the prediction is that this morphism can indeed be defined in a suitable chain version of the theory .",
    "once the above argument has been made to work , it extends the applicability of fukaya s approach in several directions .",
    "notice that string topology only enters indirectly , via viterbo s isomorphism .",
    "as long as the algebraic operations can be defined and the morphism associated to a codimension zero embedding respects them , one does not even need to know that the operations on symplectic homology are the same as those in string topology ( although this is of course expected to be true ) .",
    "moreover , one can study non - exact codimension 0 embeddings of general exact symplectic manifolds with contact boundary by this method .",
    "the basic source for this chapter are of course fukaya s papers @xcite",
    ". versions of theorem  [ thm : fukayamain ] under additional assumptions , like monotonicity of the lagrangian submanifold , are much easier to achieve , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .    for an introduction to symplectic topology",
    "the book @xcite is recommended .",
    "it covers a lot more than is necessary to understand the problem discussed here , and it gives some hints why lagrangian submanifolds are so central in symplectic topology . to learn something more specific about lagrangian embeddings and immersions , the excellent survey @xcite is still the best place to start .",
    "recently , new results have appeared which suggest that the problem in higher dimensions is more flexible than previously expected  @xcite .",
    "a chain complex @xmath628 for the free loop space on which the loop bracket is fully defined , and which therefore might serve in the implementation of theorem  [ thm : blackbox ] , has recently been proposed by irie  @xcite .",
    "finally , the reader who really wants to appreciate the discussion in this chapter needs to know quite a bit about holomorphic curves .",
    "one good source which thoroughly covers a lot of the basics , including a version of gromov compactness and a complete proof of gromov s theorem [ thm : gromov - notexact ] , is @xcite .",
