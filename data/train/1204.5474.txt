    "weidner , kroupa & bonnell ( 2010 ) compiled from the literature observational data of 100 young star clusters , whose masses lie between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and whose ages are younger than 4  myr .",
    "they showed that observed young star clusters exhibit a well - defined correlation between the maximum stellar mass in the cluster , @xmath9 , and the mass in stars , @xmath10 , of the cluster .",
    "an upper age limit of 4  myr was chosen in order to minimize any evolutionary effects on the sample .",
    "the examples of evolutionary effects discussed in their paper are as follows .",
    "firstly , mass loss of massive stars due to stellar evolution may influence the cluster mass .",
    "secondly , gas expulsion leads the cluster to lose a significant amount of its stars ( i.e. cluster mass ) by weakening of the gravitational potential when the residual gas is expelled from the cluster .",
    "however these effects unlikely affect @xmath10 owing to the young ages of the clusters in the @xcite sample .",
    "the authors corrected @xmath9 for stellar evolution in the case of o - type stars ( note that later than o - type stars would not have evolved much at this young age ) , so that the @xmath9 values provided in their paper can be considered as initial values .",
    "one process they did not take account of is the dynamical ejection of the most massive star from the cluster .",
    "the authors commented that it is highly unlikely to happen .",
    "but this has not been studied thoroughly so far .",
    "thus it is our aim in this study to investigate how often a young star cluster ejects its most massive member .",
    "this observed correlation fits a semi - analytical model",
    "well @xcite which is deduced from there being exactly one most massive star in the cluster , @xmath11 subject to the normalisation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fundamental upper limit of stellar masses @xcite , @xmath14 is the hydrogen burning mass limit ( brown dwarfs contribute negligibly to the cluster mass , thies & kroupa 2007 ) and @xmath15 is the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a pure size - of - sample effect as expected from random sampling has been excluded as an origin of the observed correlation .",
    "details of previous studies on the @xmath9@xmath10 relation can be found in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that @xcite argued that at least for the low-@xmath16 clusters ( i.e. low mass clusters ) observed maximum stellar masses do not much deviate from random drawing .",
    "this is basically true but leads the reader to the misinterpretation that a physical origin of the most - massive star in these clusters is ruled out .",
    "but @xcite show that in the mass regime considered by @xcite a physical @xmath9 and a stochastic @xmath9 can not be distinguished from each other .",
    "the observed clusters from @xcite and their semi - analytical relation are reproduced in fig .  1 .",
    "interestingly , a similar relation appears in numerical simulations of star cluster formation as well .",
    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics numerical simulations of massive star formation driven by competitive accretion ( bonnell , vine & bate 2004 ) showed that the most massive star in the forming cluster grows following the relation @xmath17 with time , t , which is a best - fit to their simulation data .",
    "this fit agrees with the semi - analytical @xmath9@xmath10 relation very well for clusters with @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , fragmentation - induced starvation studied with radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of massive star formation using the adaptive - mesh code flash @xcite also reproduce the relation found by @xcite .",
    "data from the numerical simulations of star cluster formation including the two studies mentioned above are also plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the simulation data are in good agreement with the observed data .",
    "although most of the clusters follow the relation well , there is a spread of @xmath9 values at a given cluster mass .",
    "is this spread due to stochastic effects that occur during the formation of a cluster , or does it mask a true physical functional dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath10 ? dynamical processes can exert an influence on the relation during the early evolution of the cluster .",
    "stars can be dynamically ejected through energetic few body interactions .",
    "the lightest star among the interacting stars generally obtains the highest velocity and it is unlikely that the most massive star is ejected .",
    "several theoretical studies , nevertheless , have shown that massive stars can be dynamically ejected under certain circumstances such as from a small group of massive stars lacking low - mass stars @xcite , through binary - single @xcite and binary  binary interactions @xcite .",
    "the high efficiency of dynamical ejections from dense stellar systems can indeed explain the difference between the observed and expected number of ob - type stars in the orion nebula cluster @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dense and massive r136-type clusters are efficient in expelling massive stars ( banerjee , kroupa & oh 2012 ) .",
    "thus it may be possible that the heaviest star in a cluster be dynamically ejected from the cluster .",
    "in this contribution we assume there exists an exact function , @xmath19 , and we study the ejection of the heaviest star in a cluster using direct n - body integration to investigate the effect on the @xmath9@xmath10 relation .",
    "details of the initial conditions of the cluster models and of the calculations are described in section 2 and then results are shown in section 3 . the discussion and",
    "the conclusions follow in sections  4 and  5 .",

    "single star clusters ( all stars are single ) are chosen for comparison purpose only since most stars in actuality form in a binary system @xcite .",

    "one @xmath34 star is added so that every cluster has at least one star with a mass of @xmath34 .",
    "this procedure removes the stochastic effects on the initial @xmath9 .",
    "this choice , however , gives a bump at the most massive mass - bin in the imf of the cluster , which is especially significant in small-@xmath16 ( i.e. low - mass ) clusters .",
    "as the dynamical ejection of massive stars occurs by close encounters between massive stars @xcite , our enforcement of having a @xmath34 star may enhance the ejections at a given @xmath10 by overpopulating massive stars .",
    "we find that this choice would not change our conclusion ( see further discussion in section  4 ) .",

    "the occurrences of the collisions are contained in table  3 .    for clusters with @xmath46  pc ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the average mass density within the half - mass radius ) stellar collisions rarely occur in them due to their low density . in single - star cluster models ( nms8s and ms8s )",
    ", only one cluster shows that its @xmath9 changes by a stellar collision which involves @xmath45 . in the case of binary - rich models",
    "there are a few clusters whose @xmath9 changes via stellar collisions , mostly in the most massive cluster models , but with a probability of less than 10 per cent taking all models into account . in low - density ( @xmath46  pc )",
    "clusters a change of @xmath9 through stellar collisions is highly improbable .    for clusters with @xmath6  pc ,",
    "the stellar collision result of low - mass clusters , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is similar to the result from clusters with @xmath46  pc .",
    "but in the case of the massive cluster models ( @xmath51 ) , especially the most massive one , about half of them experience a change of @xmath9 by stellar collisions .",
    "most of the collisions are induced by binary - encounters , in which the two components of a binary system collide due to their highly eccentric orbit generated by perturbation through other stars .",
    "direct dynamical collisions are extremely rare .",
    "this naturally explains why @xmath52 in table  3 becomes larger when clusters are initially binary - rich . and",
    "the number increases when massive binaries are paired with the op method when compared to rp .",
    "this can be understood because both components of a massive binary in the op method are massive stars and thus have larger sizes leading to collisions . with a different collision channel from our result , gaburov ,",
    "gualandris & portegies zwart ( 2008 ) also showed that a binary is more efficient in stellar collisions than a single star as the enhanced cross - section of a binary compared to a single star results in other stars engaging the binary , and then this can lead to a collision between one of the binary components and the incoming third star .",
    "both the dynamical ejection of the @xmath45 and stellar collisions that increase @xmath9 barely take place in the same cluster within the cluster mass range we study . as shown by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "stellar collisions generally lead to the formation of a single very massive star through the merging of several massive stars rather than the formation of many massive stars .",
    "this single very massive star is hardly ejected from the cluster and its formation reduces the number of massive stars thus it may hamper the ejection of other massive stars . out of 7200 cluster models ( excluding the @xmath53 clusters from ms3op model ) ,",
    "there are only three clusters in which both events occur . in one cluster @xmath45",
    "is dynamically ejected , but one massive binary in the cluster merges then becoming more massive than @xmath45 . in the other two clusters their @xmath45 gains mass by the collision with another star and",
    "then it is dynamically ejected .",
    "although this event is very rare , the most massive star in the star - forming region lh  95 in large magellanic cloud @xcite might be an example .",
    "the peculiarities of the star , with a much younger age than the average age of other stars in the region and the mass being higher than @xmath9 from the @xcite @xmath9@xmath10 relation , could have resulted from a stellar collision between binary components with similar masses of which the primary star may have been the initially most massive star of one of the three main substructures in the region , with a mass following the @xmath9@xmath10 relation from @xcite .",
    "the stellar collision could have increased the stellar mass and rejuvenated the star . and",

    "massive stars are overpopulated in a cluster with a bump at the most massive stellar - mass - bin of the cluster s mass function because we enforce all clusters to have a star with a mass of @xmath34 .",
    "as a necessary condition for massive star ejections is a small core of massive stars , the overpopulation of massive stars would enhance the ejection of massive stars .",
    "the other effect that might result from this choice is the over - spread of @xmath9 in low - mass ( i.e. small - number ) clusters if many of the clusters eject their @xmath45 .",
    "when stellar masses are randomly drawn from the imf low - mass clusters would hardly have a star with a mass close to @xmath9 while massive clusters , that populate stars over the whole mass range , would have a few .",

    "but , our knowledge of their initial distribution functions is still poor .",
    "we use the same period distribution for massive binaries as that of low - mass stars .",

    "the library contains two different sizes of clusters , @xmath6 and @xmath25  pc , with two different binary fractions , zero and unity . in order to take into account that observed",
    "ob binaries likely have companions with similar masses , we generate clusters with massive binaries not only paired randomly from the imf but also having a mass - ratio close to unity . in both cases",
    "the stars follow the canonical imf .",

    "stellar evolution affects the relation only for the massive ( @xmath76 ) clusters since only stars more massive than 40  @xmath77 significantly lose their mass within 3  myr .",
    "furthermore , since the mass of the @xmath45 is the same for the same cluster mass , stellar evolution can not contribute to the spread of the @xmath9 in this study .",
    "stellar collisions influence mainly massive clusters , especially for those with the smaller radius as the clusters are denser . for clusters with @xmath6  pc and @xmath78 , for about half of the clusters",
    "their @xmath9 has changed by stellar collisions within 3  myr .",
    "lastly , concerning the focus of this study , the dynamical ejection of @xmath45 only occurs in the binary - rich clusters with @xmath6  pc and @xmath79 .",
    "the number of the ejections increase when massive binaries are paired with the op method and/or are initially concentrated in the cluster centre . as massive clusters",
    "likely have a few stars with masses close to the mass of @xmath45 , @xmath9 value would change little for massive clusters when @xmath45 is dynamically ejected .",
    "overall we conclude that ( dynamical ) evolutionary effects hardly produce a spread of @xmath9 in the relation for low - mass ( @xmath80 ) or less dense ( @xmath46  pc ) clusters .",
    "massive ( @xmath81 ) , binary - rich clusters with @xmath6  pc do show a significant spread of @xmath9 , mostly produced by stellar collisions , becoming comparable to the observed spread ( fig .",
    "concerning the dynamical ejection of @xmath45 , we find that in general it is very unlikely even in relatively dense clusters with massive binaries with similar mass companions .",
    "however , its probability can reach up to 20 per cent in our cluster library depending on the initial configuration of the cluster .",
    "for example , none of the clusters without initial mass segregation but with op binaries and with @xmath81 and @xmath46  pc ( nms8op model ) eject their @xmath45 , while 8 ( 2 ) out of 100 ( 10 ) mass - segregated clusters with @xmath82 and @xmath6  pc ( ms3op model ) eject their @xmath45 ( table  3 ) . in reality , many young star clusters are observed to fulfil the conditions which are needed to eject their massive star , such as having a compact size and massive binaries with similar component masses , so that some ( up to @xmath83 per cent for @xmath84 clusters , see fig .",
    "4 ) of the real embedded clusters could have lost their initially most massive star by dynamical ejection within 3  myr .    in this paper , we are only interested in the heaviest star of the cluster . however the dynamical ejection of other massive stars in the cluster is also interesting because it is important to understand the origin of field massive stars and ob runaways @xcite to help us to constrain the initial configuration of massive stars in clusters .",
    "the dynamical ejections of ob stars in our theoretical young star cluster library will be discussed in the following paper ( oh et al . in prep . ) , and @xcite and @xcite have , respectively , already demonstrated that r136-type star - burst and onc - type clusters are very efficient in ejecting ob stars .",

    "the tidal radius is used in the paper to determine if a star belongs to the cluster . in some cases , even though @xmath45 is dynamically ejected through a strong close encounter the star may have not left the cluster yet at a given time , especially if it has obtained a relatively low velocity from the encounter .",
    "thus the real probability for ejection of @xmath45 may be higher than that presented in this paper .",
    "considering that the massive stars are generally seated in the central part of the cluster due to dynamical interactions , relatively small distance such as the half - mass radius can be used as the ejection criterion for @xmath45 .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath45 being found outside of the half - mass radius does not necessarily mean that is ejected , especially when the cluster is initially unsegregated and dynamically unevolved . here , therefore , we provide tables ( table  a1 and a2 ) which contain the mean half - mass radius and the numbers of clusters whose @xmath45 is found outside of @xmath2 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and additionally has a velocity greater than the escape velocity at the given time . for most of the cluster models",
    "the mean half - mass radii do not change much within 3  myr due to the clusters dynamical evolution .",
    "note that the initial crossing time of the clusters with @xmath87 and @xmath46  pc is longer than 3  myr ( table  2 ) .",
    "the most expanded half - mass radius is @xmath88 1  pc at 3  myr , although a few massive cluster models have expanded up to twice their initial half - mass radius .",
    "the initial positions of @xmath45 distinctly show whether the models are generated with initial mass segregation .",
    "for the initially unsegregated clusters ( table  a1 ) , more than half of the realizations for each models show that the @xmath45 is initially located outside of the half - mass radius . even in up to 23",
    "( 8) per  cent of the clusters the star is located further out than @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) at 0  myr . for the initially mass - segregated clusters , only in few low - mass clusters ( less than 5 per cent at most )",
    "is @xmath45 located outside of @xmath2 at 0  myr ( table  a2 )",
    ". it may be strange for the mass - segregated cluster to show its most massive star having an initial position beyond the half - mass radius at all .",
    "but for the initially mass - segregated clusters with low - masses ( @xmath89 ) the initial position of @xmath45 can , sometimes , be generated slightly beyond the half - mass radius due to the shallow gravitational potential , the low number statistics and the algorithm generating the initially mass - segregated cluster ( the heaviest star being the _ most bound _ to the cluster , but not requiring it to be at the most central position ) .",
    "none of the initially mass - segregated clusters have @xmath45 located initially further out than @xmath90 .    for the initially not mass - segregated clusters with relatively high masses ( @xmath91 ) and/or @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath93 in table  a1 significantly decrease at 3  myr as a result of dynamical evolution , i.e. dynamical mass segregation .",
    "but there are still a large number of the unsegregated clusters , particularly the low - density ones , which have @xmath45 beyond the half - mass radius . in many of the cases",
    "the star has a velocity lower than the escape velocity .",
    "as those clusters are dynamically young and the velocity of the star is too small to escape from its cluster , it is unlikely that these stars are dynamically ejected . either the star was initially located beyond the half - mass radius and has not fallen into the cluster centre yet . or , if @xmath45 of the low - density clusters has an initial orbit as large as the half - mass radius ( note that the half - mass radius is less than a pc ) , it could be temporarily found beyond the half - mass radius since the dynamical interactions which lead to the massive star being confined to the central part of the cluster are insufficient by 3  myr for these low - density clusters .",
    "this can also explain that for the mass - segregated clusters with low masses , especially with @xmath23 , @xmath93 increases at 3  myr and most of these clusters have @xmath45 moving slower than the escape velocity .",
    "there are only two initially mass segregated clusters with @xmath23 whose @xmath45 is found beyond twice the half - mass radius at 3  myr .",
    "there are due to low - energy encounters expelling the stars from the core without ejecting them from the cluster .",
    "however , in the nms3op and ms3op models , and in massive ( @xmath94 ) clusters from the other models , a number of clusters have @xmath45 being beyond the half - mass radius with a velocity larger than the escape velocity , which implies that the @xmath45 stars are dynamically ejected .",
    "the probability of @xmath45 ejection increases with cluster mass .",
    "40 per cent of the @xmath73 ms3op clusters have probably ejected their @xmath45 .",
