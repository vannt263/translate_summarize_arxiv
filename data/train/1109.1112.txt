    "with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern now collecting copious amounts of data , the testing of the standard model ( sm ) has entered a new phase . concerning the quark - flavour sector",
    ", the decay @xmath0 , which we abbreviate from here on as @xmath12 , offers an interesting probe of cp violation @xcite .",
    "in particular , this channel allows us to search for cp - violating new - physics ( np ) contributions to @xmath2@xmath3 mixing , which is conventionally studied via the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the draw back of the @xmath1 mode is that its final state contains two vector mesons and is thereby a mixture of cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates .",
    "consequently , in order to disentangle the cp eigenstates , a time - dependent angular analysis of the decay products @xmath13 and @xmath14 is necessary @xcite . in contrast , because the @xmath4 is a scalar state with quantum numbers @xmath15 @xcite , the final state of @xmath12 is a @xmath16-wave state with the cp eigenvalue @xmath17 and thus an angular analysis is not needed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 channel was observed by the lhcb and belle experiments in the spring of 2011 @xcite .",
    "these results have recently been confirmed by the 0 @xcite ( with a preliminary measurement ) and cdf collaborations @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : brs ] , we list the reported data for @xmath12 with @xmath18 , which is the dominant channel .",
    "lhcb , 0 and cdf do not measure the branching ratio directly , but instead its fraction , @xmath19 , with respect to the branching ratio for @xmath1 with @xmath20 . for comparison ,",
    "we have also included in the table the corresponding branching ratios of these fractions using additional experimental input from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we observe that the number of events for @xmath12 with @xmath21 is about four times smaller than for @xmath1 with @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , as no angular analysis is required , the @xmath12 channel offers a convenient alternative to the conventional @xmath1 decay from an experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "in addition to a branching ratio result , the cdf collaboration has reported a first measurement for the effective @xmath12 lifetime @xcite , and the lhcb collaboration has very recently presented a first preliminary analysis of cp violation in @xmath12 @xcite . in the future , we should see more precise measurements of the corresponding observables .",

    "the mixing phase also plays a key role for the time - dependent cp asymmetry of @xmath12 , which we address in section  [ sec : cp ] .",
    "the theoretical predictions given in sections  [ sec : lifetime ] and [ sec : cp ] are limited by doubly cabibbo - suppressed hadronic contributions . in section  [ sec : bd ] , we point out that these effects can be constrained by an analysis of the @xmath8 channel , which has not yet been observed and would be an interesting addition to the experimental agenda .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "contrary to the continuing search for an elementary scalar particle , a variety of scalar hadronic bound states have long been observed .",
    "these states are often categorized according to whether their mass falls above or below 1 gev .",
    "those belonging to the former category are expected to be composed predominantly of quark  antiquark states and among them a @xmath34 flavour nonet can be identified . unfortunately , the @xmath4 belongs to the latter category , where , as we will see , the interpretation is far from being straightforward .",
    "the @xmath4 is an isospin singlet with a mass of @xmath35 mev , just below the @xmath36 threshold , and a full width between 40 mev and 100 mev , which reflects the fact that the width determination is very model - dependent @xcite .    in the literature ,",
    "the hadronic structure of the @xmath4 state has been discussed for decades and there are may different interpretations , from the conventional quark  antiquark picture @xcite to multiquark @xcite or @xmath37 bound states @xcite ( for a review , see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite and references within ) . as the goal is to use the @xmath12 decay for precision tests of the cp - violating sector of the sm",
    ", it is a natural and important question to explore how the hadronic structure of the @xmath4 affects the corresponding observables . in this section",
    ", we have a closer look at popular descriptions of the @xmath4 , setting the stage for the discussion of the @xmath12 observables .",
    "we will focus on two specific frameworks : the quark  antiquark and tetraquark pictures .      in the conventional quark model , the scalar hadronic states are interpreted as mesons , i.e.  quark  antiquark ( @xmath38 ) bound states , with an orbital angular momentum of @xmath39 and a spin of @xmath40 coupled to give a total angular momentum of @xmath41 .",
    "in analogy to the pseudo - scalar mesons , it is suggestive to group the observed scalar states into nonets of the @xmath34 flavour symmetry of strong interactions .    for the scalar states with masses",
    "@xmath42  gev , we can identify an isotriplet @xmath43 , two strange isodoublets , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , and two isosinglets , @xmath46 or @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the nave quark model , assuming ideal mixing between the heaviest and lightest members of the @xmath34 nonet , the @xmath4 and @xmath49 , respectively , their quark - flavour composition would simply be given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 components .",
    "however , there is also experimental evidence for a non - strange component of the @xmath4 , which could be interpreted as evidence for the following mixing structure : @xmath53 here the mixing angle @xmath54 is the counterpart of the @xmath55@xmath56 mixing angle in the standard pseudo - scalar nonet.@xmath56 mixing angle , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    the determination of @xmath54 is affected by large errors and appears process and model dependent .",
    "let us give a few examples :    * using @xmath57 transitions caused dominantly by @xmath58 processes , the range @xmath59 was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . * by making a simultaneous calculation of radiative decays of the kind @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . * in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that a value of @xmath64 is consistent with the resonance data from @xmath65 and @xmath66 decays . * using two different methods to fit the @xmath67 branching ratios ( covariant light - front dynamics and dispersion relations ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the unsatisfactory picture for the mixing angle , these studies show that the @xmath4 has a significant @xmath70 component .",
    "this feature is also supported by the recent observation of the @xmath12 channel , with measurements as summarized in table  [ tab : brs ] .    due to their non - zero orbital angular momentum , the scalar mesons are expected to be heavier than the pseudo - scalar and vector mesons in the nave quark picture .",
    "this is not , however , the case for the light scalars that have masses below @xmath71  gev .",
    "furthermore , the light scalar mass spectrum bears little resemblance with that of a standard nonet . an attractive framework to overcome these phenomenological problems",
    "is offered by the tetraquark model .      in the tetraquark picture ,",
    "scalar states with quantum numbers @xmath15 are formed by the binding of diquark and anti - diquark configurations .",
    "a diquark , denoted by @xmath72 $ ] , transforms as @xmath73 under @xmath74 colour symmetry , has spin @xmath75 , and transforms as @xmath73 under @xmath34 flavour symmetry .",
    "anti - diquarks , denoted by @xmath76 $ ] , are in the corresponding conjugate representations .",
    "the bound scalar states of diquarks and anti - diquarks , which do not require a non - vanishing angular momentum @xmath77 in contrast to the @xmath38 interpretation , can reproduce the @xmath34 nonet structure and mass ordering in a natural way @xcite . the physical @xmath4 and @xmath49 states",

    "@xcite , it was pointed out that a coherent picture of the scalar mesons can be obtained through mixing between tetraquark and @xmath38 states due to instanton effects . here",
    "the light scalar mesons @xmath42  gev are predominantly tetraquark states while their heavier counterparts , with masses @xmath81  gev , are predominantly @xmath38 states",
    ". a fit of this model to data adequately describes the mass spectrum .      in lattice",
    "qcd , there is an ongoing effort to calculate the spectrum of the low - lying scalars and to study observables that will allow us to distinguish between exotic and conventional states ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the phenomenological side ,",
    "several processes are under scrutiny to probe the structure of the @xmath4 .",
    "particularly interesting are radiative",
    "@xmath82 decays , which were proposed to distinguish between the standard @xmath83 and tetraquark interpretation .",
    "one evident difference is that the radiative transition of the @xmath84 to a non - strange @xmath85 state would require the annihilation and creation of an additional quark ",
    "antiquark pair in the @xmath38 picture , which is suppressed by the okubo ",
    "iizuka ( ozi ) rule . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition to a @xmath86 state containing a @xmath87 pair requires only the creation of an additional @xmath85 pair , which is not ozi - suppressed .",
    "also here the data seem to favour a tetraquark picture , although alternative interpretations involving model - dependent assumptions are possible as well ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "further insights come from two - photon fusion or decays into two photons thanks to their sensitivity to the electric charge of the constituent quarks of the @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4 has also been observed in hadronic decays of @xmath88 bosons , where its production properties are found to be similar to those of a @xmath89 meson .",
    "this supports the @xmath38 picture although there are currently no predictions for the production rates of the tetraquark or the even more exotic @xmath36 molecule picture available @xcite .    over the last decade ,",
    "a large amount of data for decays of heavy mesons has become available , opening the way for new studies to reveal the hadronic structure of the @xmath4 .",

    "presumably strong attractive forces are at work between these quark correlations , but the hadronization mechanism itself is essentially unknown .    the central question for the analysis of the @xmath278 system is the competition between the @xmath286 and penguin topologies in ( [ btetra ] )",
    ". should the former give a contribution at the same  or even larger  level as the penguins , which would be reflected by a sizeable value of @xmath121 , we could not control the hadronic effects through the @xmath266 channel . in view of this situation",

    "thanks to recent measurements , the @xmath12 channel is receiving increasing interest to complement the @xmath1 mode in the search for cp - violating np contributions to @xmath2@xmath3 mixing .",
    "in contrast to the latter decay , the @xmath12 analysis is simpler as no time - dependent angular analysis is required . on the other hand",
    ", we have approximately one fourth of the events available .    in this paper",
    ", we have performed a detailed study of the effective lifetime and the cp - violating observables of @xmath12 , with a critical look at possible hadronic uncertainties .",
    "this is an important issue , in particular as the hadronic structure of the @xmath4 is still controversial .",
    "it turns out that the effective lifetime is very robust with respect to such effects , with an error that is essentially fully dominated by the theoretical prediction of the width difference of the @xmath33-meson system in the sm .",
    "we find that the first measurement by the cdf collaboration is about @xmath152 above a general upper bound derived in this paper , which relies on the sm value of @xmath257 . a future measurement of the lifetime at",
    "the 1% level would offer an interesting probe of the @xmath2@xmath3 mixing phase , which may be affected by cp - violating contributions to @xmath2@xmath3 mixing .    a sharper picture of such effects is offered by the mixing - induced cp violation @xmath5 of the @xmath12 channel .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has very recently reported the first analysis of this kind , corresponding to @xmath287 .",

    "the @xmath266 decay , which has not yet been observed , offers an interesting control channel for the sm corrections .",
    "the leading contributions emerge from the @xmath52 component of the @xmath4",
    ". it would be interesting to add @xmath266 to the experimental agenda .",
    "we have estimated its branching ratio with @xmath18 at the few times @xmath289 level . in this case , a first signal may be seen in the near future .    in the quark ",
    "antiquark description of the @xmath4 , assuming a mixing angle @xmath54 significantly different from @xmath279 or @xmath280 , we have shown that the hadronic corrections to @xmath5 can be controlled through the observables of @xmath266 by means of @xmath34 arguments . on the other hand , should the @xmath4 be a tetraquark , we would have to deal with an additional topology at the tree level in @xmath12 that does not have a counterpart in @xmath266 .",
    "if it plays a significant role with respect to the conventional hadronic tree amplitude , there may be significant corrections for @xmath5 which can no longer be controlled via @xmath266 . in the event that future  nave \" determinations ( i.e.  neglecting the hadronic corrections ) of @xmath6 from @xmath12 and @xmath1 give sizeably different values , this may be traced back to the tetraquark topology in @xmath12 .",
    "as the experimental precision improves , the sm corrections to the determination of @xmath6 from the @xmath1 decay also have to be controlled .",
    "the conceptual advantage of this channel with respect to @xmath12 is that it does not suffer from the poorly known hadronic structure of the @xmath4 state .",
