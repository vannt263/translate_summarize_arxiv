    "over the last two decades , instrumented indentation technique ( iit ) has become a widespread procedure that is used to probe mechanical properties for samples of nearly any size or nature .",
    "however , the intrinsic heterogeneity of the mechanical fields underneath the indenter prevents from establishing straightforward relationships between the measured load _ vs. _ displacement curve and any expected mechanical properties as it would be the case for a tensile test .",
    "many models have been published in the literature in order to enable the measurement of properties such as an elastic modulus , hardness or various plastic properties . despite their diversity ,",
    "most of these models deeply rely on the accurate measurement of the projected contact area between the indenter and the sample s surface .",
    "the existing methods that are dedicated to estimating the true contact area can be classified into two subcategories : the direct methods which rely on the sole load _ vs. _ displacement curve @xcite and the _ post mortem _ methods that use additional data extracted from the residual imprint left on the sample s surface .",
    "for example , vickers , brinell and knoop hardness scales rely on _ post mortem _ measurements of the geometric size of the residual imprint .",
    "however , in the case of vickers hardness , the contact area is only estimated through the diagonals of the imprint , the possible effect of piling - up or sinking - in is then neglected .",
    "post mortem _ methods use indent cross sections to estimate the projected contact area @xcite . in the 1990s ,",
    "the development of nanoindentation led to a growing interest in direct methods because they do not require time consuming _ post mortem _ measurement of micrometer or even nanometer scale imprints , typically using atomic force microscopy ( afm ) or scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .",
    "uncertainty level on direct measurements remains high , mainly because of the difficulty to predict the occurrence of piling - up and sinking - in .",
    "oliver and pharr have eventually considered this issue as one of the _ `` holy grails '' _ in iit @xcite .",
    "recent development in scanning probe microscopy ( spm ) using the indentation tip ( itspm ) brought new interest in _ post mortem _ measurements .",
    "indeed , itspm allows systematic imprint imaging without manipulating the sample or facing repositioning issues to find back the imprint to be imaged . yet",
    "itspm imaging technique suffers from drawbacks when compared to afm : it is slower , it uses a blunter tip associated with a much wider pyramidal geometry and a higher force applied to the surface while scanning . while the later may damage delicate material surfaces",
    ", the formers will introduce artifacts .",
    "nonetheless , these artifacts will not affect the present method .",
    "in addition , itspm only allows for contact mode imaging , non contact or intermittent contact modes are not possible . as a consequence ,",
    "only the techniques based on altitude images can be used with itspm and there is a need for new methods as very recently reviewed by marteau _",
    "this article introduces a new _ post mortem _ procedure that relies only on the altitude image and that is therefore valid for most types of spm images , including itspm . in this paper , a benchmark based on both numerical indentation tests as well as experimental indentation tests on properly chosen materials to span all possible behaviors is first introduced .",
    "then , the existing direct methods are reviewed and a complete description of the proposed method is given .",
    "these methods are then confronted using the above mentioned benchmark and the results are finally discussed .",
    "a typical instrumented indentation test features a loading step where the load @xmath0 is increased up to a maximum value @xmath1 , then held constant in order to detect creep and finally decreased during the unloading step until contact is lost between the indenter and the sample .",
    "a residual imprint is left on the initially flat surface of the sample . during the test ,",
    "the load @xmath0 as well as the penetration of the indenter into the surface of the sample @xmath2 is continuously recorded and can be plotted as shown in figure [ fig : figure_1 ] . for most materials , the unloading step can be cycled with only minor hysteresis , it is then assumed that only elastic strains develop in the sample . as a consequence , the initial slope @xmath3 of the unloading step",
    "is called the elastic contact stiffness .",
    "useful data can potentially be extracted from both the load _ vs. _ displacement curve and the residual imprint .",
    "the contact area @xmath4 is defined as the projection of the contact zone between the indenter and the sample at maximum load on the plane of the initially flat surface of the sample .",
    "finite element modeling ( fem ) simulations are performed using a two - dimensional axisymmetrical model represented in figure [ fig : figure_2 ] .",
    "the sample is meshed with 3316 four - noded quadrilateral elements .",
    "the indenter is considered as a rigid cone exhibiting an half - angle @xmath5  to match the theoretical area function of the vickers and modified berkovich indenters @xcite .",
    "the displacement of the indenter @xmath2 is controlled and the force @xmath0 is recorded .",
    "the dimensions of the mesh are chosen to minimize the effect of the far - field boundary conditions .",
    "the typical ratio of the maximum contact radius and the sample size is about @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is solved using the commercial software abaqus ( version 6.11 ,  3ds.com ) .",
    "the numerical model is compared to the elastic solution from @xcite ( see @xcite ) using a blunt conical indenter ( @xmath7 ) to respect the purely axial contact pressure hypothesis used in the elastic solution .",

    "after each simulation , a load _ vs. _ displacement into surface curve and an altitude spm like image using the gwyddion ( http://gwyddion.net/ ) gsf format are extracted .",

    "lo : :    the loubet method @xcite is an alternative to the op method ,    especially for materials exhibiting piling - up .    regardless of the chosen method , the value of @xmath38 is used to compute the value of the contact area @xmath4 thanks to the indenter area function @xmath41 ( iaf ) .",
    "the iaf depends on the theoretical shape of the indenter as well and on its actual defects which are measured during a calibration procedure .",

    "spm imaging grants access to a mapping of the altitude of the residual imprint .",
    "it is assumed that the surface of the sample is initially plane and remains unaffected far from the residual imprint .",
    "this plane is extracted from the raw image using a disk shaped mask centered on the imprint and a scan by scan linear fit on the remaining zone .",
    "it is considered as the reference surface and is subtracted to the raw image to remove the tilt of the initial surface . under maximum load ,",
    "the contact contour can exhibit either sinking - in and piling - up . in the first case",
    ", its altitude is decreased _ vis -  - vis _ the reference surface .",
    "this behavior is typical of high yield strength materials such as fused quartz . on the opposite ,",
    "piling - up occurs when the the increased and is typically triggered by unconfined plastic flow around the indenter as usually observed on low strain hardening metallic alloys .",
    "when the indenter is not axisymmetric ( as it is the case for pyramids ) , both sinking - in and piling - up may occur simultaneously .",
    "for example , pyramidal indenters can produce piling - up on their faces and sinking on their edges ( or no piling - up to the least ) . during the unloading step ,",
    "the whole contact contour is pushed upward with only minor radial displacement .",
    "a residual piling - up may form even if sinking - in initially occurred under maximum load .",
    "we now focus on a half cross - section of the imprint starting at the bottom of the imprint and formulate two assumptions :    1 .",
    "the highest point of any half cross - section is the summit of the residual piling - up .",
    "the summit of the residual piling - up indicates the position of the contact contour .    as a consequence , the highest point of the cross - section gives the radial position of the contact zone boundary .",
    "however , from an experimental point of view , the roughness of the sample s surface may make the true position of the residual piling - up s summit unclear .",
    "this issue is particularly true for materials exhibiting high levels of sinking - in such as fused quartz but also for most materials along the edges of pyramidal indenters . in order to limit the effect of surface roughness on the radial localization of the contact zone boundary , each profile",
    "is slightly rotated by a small angle value @xmath56 along an axis perpendicular to the cross - section plane and running through the bottom of the imprint ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the lowest point of the profile ) .",
    "the whole contact contour is then determined by repeating the process in all directions ( @xmath57  to @xmath58 ) then the contact area @xmath59 is calculated .",
    "a graphical representation of key steps of the method is made in figure [ fig : figure_4 ] .",
    "[ please insert figure 4 here ]",
    "the four methods are confronted on the numerical benchmark and their ability to accurately compute the contact area @xmath4 is challenged .",
    "the results focus on the relative error @xmath60 between @xmath4 and the contact area predicted by each method .",
    "please note that a @xmath61 relative error on the contact area means roughly a @xmath62 relative error on hardness but only @xmath63 on the elastic modulus ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sneddon ] ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ fig : figure_5 ] and [ fig : figure_6 ] for constitutive equations ce1 and ce2 respectively and a summary of the key statistics is given in table [ tab : num_bench ] .",
    "[ fig : figure_5 ] and [ fig : figure_6 ] , * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * represent the relative error and its absolute value respectively .",
    "the later was chose to emphasize the magnitude of the error while * ( c ) * indicates whether piling - up or sinking - in occurs .",
    "it is also chosen to measure the success rate of the methods through their ability to match @xmath4 within a @xmath64 error .",
    "this value was chosen since even if challenging , it is still realistic from an experimental point of view .",
    "these data can be discussed individually for each method :    * the dn method systematically tends to underestimate @xmath4 regardless of the type of constitutive equation and of the occurrence of piling - up or sinking - in .",
    "the magnitude of the relative error is the highest among the four tested methods .",
    "this lack of accuracy can be put into perspective by recalling that the dn method states that the contact between the indenter and the sample behaves as if the indenter was a flat punch during the first stages of the unloading process .",
    "this approach was later proved to be too restrictive by oliver and pharr @xcite who improved it by taking into account the actual shape of the indenter through the @xmath65 coefficient .",
    "as @xmath66 in the case of the modified berkovich tip , the value of the contact depth @xmath38 is systematically increased ( see table [ tab : direct_methods ] ) . * as stated above , the op method drastically improves the overall performances of the dn method .",
    "however , its error level depends strongly on the type of contact behavior ( _ i .",
    "e. _ piling - up or sinking - in ) and the mechanical properties of the tested material .",
    "typically , it performs well for the ce1 law when the strain hardening exponent @xmath17 verifies @xmath67 .",
    "it also performs well ( relative errors below @xmath61 ) on materials exhibiting very high yield strains ( higher than @xmath68 in the case of ce2 .",
    "the main drawback of the method is its intrinsic inability to cope with piling - up since @xmath69 can never be higher than 1 .",
    "this is particularly visible for low values of the strain hardening exponent ( ce1 : @xmath70 ) and with ce2 when the compressive yield strain @xmath71 is lower than @xmath72 .",
    "the op method has a low success rate ( see table [ tab : num_bench ] ) but this tendency has to be mitigated by the fact that it is very efficient for a large number of metallic alloys , which can be described by ce1 and exhibit moderate values of hardening exponents . *",
    "the lo method allows @xmath73 values and is then recommended for piling - up materials ; it is overall very efficient with ce2 type materials .",
    "the drawback is that it tends to overestimate the contact area when sinking - in occurs ; this is particularly true in the case of ce1 with moderate to high hardening exponents ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the results of cheng and cheng @xcite regarding the influence of piling - up and sinking - in on the direct estimation of the contact depth .",
    "the success rate of this method is the highest among the direct methods and it is clearly the best available direct method for ce2 type materials and for low hardening ce1 type materials . * the proposed method exhibits a @xmath75 success rate ( with the @xmath76 relative error target ) and an average absolute relative error of @xmath77 .",
    "the error level remains stable regardless of both the type of constitutive equation and its parameters .",
    "this result highlights the fact that when experimentally possible , the use of such a _ post mortem _ method will improve drastically the overall error level of the contact area measurement .",
    "the results of the experimental benchmark are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_7 ] . the tendencies observed in the numerical benchmark",
    "are confirmed .",
    "the dn method systematically underestimates the contact area .",
    "the op and lo methods perform well only on a given spectrum of contact behaviors : both methods give accurate results on the fq sample ; this is consistent with the fact that both of them were optimized to use this material as a reference .",
    "while the lo method also exhibits a low error level on the wg sample , the op method leads to an unexpected high error level .",
    "it is supposed that even if the wg sample has a very high yield strain , it has no strain hardening mechanism and it is then out of the scope of the op method .",
    "the bmg which exhibits a large residual piling - up obviously leads the op method to underestimate drastically the contact area . the lo method performs better although it also underestimates the contact area .",
    "this later method systematically exhibits relative errors of @xmath64 while the method proposed in this paper is even more reliable with errors lower than @xmath78 .",
    "we observe that the direct methods overall performances are better than in the case of the numerical benchmark .",
    "the contact friction , which is neglected in the numerical benchmark , may improve the accuracy of the direct methods without affecting the proposed method .",
    "both benchmarks highlight the precision gap between the new method and the existing direct methods .",
    "however , the proposed method differs by nature from the three direct methods it is compared to .",
    "this section emphasizes the pros and cons of this method :    disadvantages : : :    * the proposed method relies on spm imaging of the residual imprint    while direct methods do not . however , indentation devices tend to be    equipped with itspm capability that can be used automatically in    conjunction with the indentation testing itself with only a small    increase in test duration .",
    "*   advantages : : :    * the proposed method can be run automatically , it requires no    adjustable parameters and is user independent .",
    "* sample holder and machine stiffness affect the measurement of the    penetration into surface @xmath2 as well as the measured    contact stiffness @xmath3 and , as a consequence , they also    affect all direct methods .",
    "the value of the machine stiffness can be    measured once and for all while the sample holder s stiffness may    change between two samples and requires systematic calibration .",
    "this    concern is particularly true in the case of small samples such as    fibers as well as very hard materials ( such as carbides ) .",
    "the contact    area measurement provided by the proposed method does not rely on    @xmath2 and is then insensitive to the effect of those    spurious stiffness issues . yet , let us note that while the value of    the contact area @xmath59 is unaffected by stiffness    issues , the value of the contact stiffness @xmath3 is of    course affected . as a consequence ,",
    "the value of the hardness probed    with the proposed method is free from any stiffness concern ( as    @xmath79 ) while the value of the reduced modulus    @xmath80 still requires stiffness calibration ( as    @xmath81 ) .",
    "* the method does not require any tip calibration procedure and is    compatible with all tip shapes .",
    "* the method is unaffected by erroneous surface detection also because    it does not rely on @xmath2 .",
    "we have proposed a new procedure to estimate the indentation contact area based on the residual imprint observation using altitude images produced by spm .",
    "this area is the key component of instrumented indentation testing for extracting mechanical properties such as hardness or elastic modulus . for the estimation of this contact area ,",
    "the method has been confronted with three widely used direct methods .",
    "we have showed , by means of an experimental and numerical benchmark covering a large range of contact geometries and materials , that the proposed method is far more accurate than its direct counterparts regardless of the type of material .",
    "we have also discussed the fact that such _",
    "post mortem _ procedures are indeed more time consuming than direct methods ; yet they are the future alternative to direct methods with the development of indentation tip scanning probe microscopy techniques .",
    "we have also emphasized the fact that this new method has numerous advantages : it can be automated , it is user independent , it is unaffected by stiffness issues and does not require any indenter calibration .",
