    "instabilities and waves in rotating fluids are important in numerous technical applications . in most cases",
    "it is important to avoid these phenomena in order to ensure the stability of fast spinning liquid filled bodies like gyroscopes @xcite , spacecrafts @xcite or projectiles @xcite .",
    "waves in rotating fluids are also of general interest because of their fundamental character in oceanographic and atmospheric flows @xcite like , e.g. , zonal flows in the atmospheres of saturn or jupiter that may develop via a modulation instability of meridional rossby waves @xcite . moreover , the identification of inertial waves in the earth s fluid outer core @xcite allows conclusions on the core dynamics and the associated dynamo process that is responsible for the generation of the earth s magnetic field . nowadays",
    ", it is believed that in general planetary dynamos are driven by rotating thermal or compositional convection @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "other types of flows can not be ruled out , and , for example , a superposition of random inertial waves in a rotating conducting fluid is capable of transferring energy in a magnetic field as well @xcite .",
    "however , in the model of , field and flow must decay in the long term because of the lack of energy sources required for a steady driving .",
    "this problem can be overcome by more complex models in which , for example , the equatorial heat flux in the earth s outer core provides a persistent excitation mechanism for inertial waves with sufficient helicity for the generation of planetary magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "inertial waves can be excited by precessional forcing as well , and it has long been discussed whether precession of the earth can provide the necessary power to drive the geodynamo @xcite .    in a next - generation dynamo experiment currently under development at helmholtz - zentrum dresden - rossendorf ( hzdr ) a precession driven flow of liquid sodium will be used to validate its suitability to drive a dynamo @xcite . since the precessional forcing provides a natural driving mechanism , it represents a qualitatively new approach compared to previous dynamo experiments , where an optimized flow was driven either by impellers @xcite or by a system of electromagnetic pumps @xcite .",
    "a small - scale water experiment is currently running at hzdr in order to examine the hydrodynamic properties of a precession driven flow in a cylindrical container with strong forcing and a large precession angle .",
    "measurements of pressure fluctuations and of axial velocity profiles show three distinct flow regimes in dependence of the precession ratio : a laminar state ( with only the forced mode ) followed by a non - linear regime with various modes superimposed on the fundamental mode , eventually leading to a permanent chaotic state when a critical precession ratio is exceeded @xcite .",
    "presumably , the ability of the flow to drive a dynamo will be different in the three regimes and although the precessional dynamo experiment at hzdr will allow magnetic reynolds numbers of the order of @xmath2 ( based on the rotation velocity and the radius of the cylindrical container ) it is a priori not obvious whether a magnetic field will be self - generated at all .",
    "there are promising indications for dynamo action driven by precession both from liquid sodium experiments by which  despite of the rather small precession ratio",
    " achieved an amplification of an applied field by a factor of three , as well as from simulations in spheres @xcite , spheroids @xcite , ellipsoids @xcite , cubes @xcite and cylinders @xcite .",
    "however , kinematic dynamo simulations demonstrate that the primary forced mode alone , which consists of a single , non - axisymmetric mode with azimuthal wave number @xmath3 and axial wave number @xmath4 , can not drive a dynamo at a reasonable @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this coincides with who showed that a linear wave packet of inertial waves can not drive a mean - field dynamo .",
    "however , this does not generally preclude the possibility of quasi - laminar or small scale dynamo action driven by inertial waves or another precession induced instability with sufficient intricate topology .",
    "experimental studies in a weakly precessing cylinder filled with a non - conducting fluid showed a large diversity of flow phenomena with complex structures frequently resulting in a vigorous turbulent state @xcite .",
    "other experiments revealed large scale structures like a system of intermittent , cyclonic vortices that may provide a strong source of helicity and hence be beneficial for a dynamo @xcite , or free kelvin modes with an azimuthal wave number @xmath6 and @xmath7 propagating around the symmetry axis of a weakly precessing cylinder @xcite .",
    "free kelvin modes are the natural eigenmodes in a rotating cylinder @xcite and are promising candidates for driving quasi - laminar dynamo action in case of precessional forcing because at least a subclass of these modes has a structure similar to the columnar convection cells that are responsible for dynamo action in convection driven models of the geodynamo @xcite .",
    "free kelvin modes may emerge from non - linear interactions of a forced kelvin mode with itself or as a parametric instability that involves the forced mode and two free kelvin modes @xcite .",
    "the latter case requires appropriate combinations of wave numbers , frequencies and a geometry such that all three modes become resonant simultaneously which usually is named a triadic resonance .",
    "triadic resonances have been observed in simulations of precession driven flow in a spheroid @xcite and , experimentally , in weakly forced precession in a cylinder @xcite and a cylindrical annulus @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we conduct numerical simulations of a precessing flow far below the transition to the chaotic state observed in water experiments , but with sufficient forcing to excite free kelvin modes with azimuthal wave numbers @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on the impact of the aspect ratio which  at least in the linear approximation  determines whether an inertial wave becomes resonant .",
    "we identify different free kelvin modes by means of their spatial structure , and we compute their frequencies from the azimuthal drift motion in order to conclude whether the free kelvin modes constitute a triadic resonance .",
    "the results are used to further constrain the modes that may be observed in the water experiment at hzdr and will be applied in future simulations of the magnetic induction equation in order to proof whether free kelvin modes are suitable to drive a dynamo .",
    "the flow of a fluid with kinematic viscosity @xmath9 in the frame of an enclosed precessing cylinder is described by the navier - stokes equation including terms for the coriolis force and the poincar force : @xmath10     and the rotation axis precesses with @xmath11 . in the simulations we varied the aspect ratio @xmath12 and",

    "in all cases the amplitude of the free modes that constitute a triadic resonance strongly oscillates with a maximum of up to 50% of the forced mode ( @xmath96 ) which corresponds to roughly 6% of the angular velocity of the cylindrical container .",

    "we performed numerical simulations of a precession driven flow in cylindrical geometry .",
    "the simulations confirm that the energy that can be injected via precessional forcing is very sensitive to the aspect ratio of the cylindrical container .",
    "significant contributions of higher non - axisymmetric components appear only in a limited range of aspect ratios ( for @xmath98 $ ] ) and it turns out that in that regime the behavior of the forced mode ( with @xmath3 ) can not be described by a linear theory .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases the forced kelvin mode ( @xmath3 ) dominates and free kelvin modes with higher azimuthal wave number appear as distortions of the forced mode .",
    "the maximum response of the flow takes place at @xmath99 which is remarkable far away from the resonance predicted by the linear in - viscid approximation ( at @xmath100 ) . at the resonance maximum",
    "our results yield an amplitude for the @xmath101-component of the flow of @xmath102 , which  assuming isotropy  roughly agrees with the estimations of .",
    "the amplitude of the forced mode decreases with increasing distance from the resonance maximum , and in the regimes with triadic resonances , we still observe values of @xmath103 ( in terms of the azimuthal velocity of the container ) . in real units ( assuming @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) this would correspond to fluid velocities of @xmath106 ( at resonance ) and @xmath107 ( off resonance ) which is of the same order as the typical flow speed in the riga dynamo experiment . regarding the higher kelvin modes ,",
    "the saturated amplitudes of the strongest free kelvin modes are mostly independent of the forced mode and achieve values of about @xmath108 to @xmath109 in terms of the angular velocity of the container corresponding to @xmath110 in the experiment .    at the aspect ratio envisaged for the experiment ( @xmath50 with @xmath111 and @xmath105 ) we may expect an energy of the fluid flow at roughly two thirds of the maximum value at the optimum aspect ratio ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , this optimum aspect ratio probably depends on the reynolds number and on the forcing , so that we believe that the chosen geometry for the dynamo experiment is a good compromise to ensure an efficiently driven fluid flow in a container with a ratio of diameter to height that at least approximately reflects the geometry of planetary bodies .",
    "although at present we do not know whether the flow fields that emerge in our simulations will be able to drive a dynamo , we may try to estimate typical magnetic field strengths that can be expected in the planned dynamo experiment .",
    "we assume a saturation of the magnetic energy at roughly @xmath113 of the kinetic energy of the hydrodynamic flow which is substantiated by the saturation behavior of the riga dynamo @xcite .",
    "we further presuppose that the internal velocity caused by the precessional forcing linearly scales with the rotation of the container ( and hence with @xmath114 ) and assume an angular velocity of @xmath115 , a radius @xmath116 , a height @xmath117 and a density of liquid sodium of @xmath118 ( at @xmath119 ) .",
    "after the change over to real units the kinetic energy obtained in our simulations at @xmath50 ( @xmath120 ) corresponds approximately to a magnetic field strength @xmath121 .",
    "this is in the range of the riga dynamo which is not particularly surprising since the typical velocities obtained in our simulations indeed match the velocity arising in the riga dynamo .",
    "however , given that the corresponding @xmath3 mode has produced no dynamo in the kinematic simulations it might be more realistic to refer to the free kelvin modes with higher @xmath31 which have less kinetic energy . in that case",
    "the typical magnetic field strength amounts to only @xmath122 which , however , is still in the range of the values obtained at the von - krmn - sodium dynamo @xcite . we expect a stronger response and hence a larger saturation field strength for increasing @xmath1 , at least as long as we remain below the critical poincare number for the sudden transition to a chaotic state",
    ". however , unless we know whether or not the precession driven flow will have the right structure and sufficient magnitude to excite dynamo action at all , these estimations are only useful to demonstrate that the reference values assumed for the planned dynamo experiment will allow magnetic fields with a reasonable field strength .    regarding the structure of the flow , we find various manifestations of non - axisymmetric contributions in terms of free kelvin modes with higher azimuthal wave numbers @xmath31 .",
    "we find free kelvin modes in resonance with the forced mode only when the forced mode is sufficiently far away from its primary resonance , i.e. , when the amplitude of the forced mode is not too strong .",
    "triadic resonances can be clearly identified using a combined fourier - discrete sine transformation in the azimuth and along the axis with structure and frequencies close to predictions from linear theory .",
    "actually , we were also expecting triads around @xmath123 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , we do find patterns of free kelvin modes in that regime , but no combination of them satisfies the triadic resonance conditions .",
    "instead , we see free kelvin modes solely with retrograde drift motion and for each azimuthal wavenumber @xmath31 the contributions with @xmath4 and @xmath124 are approximately of equal strength so that in sum we see a clear breaking of the equatorial symmetry of the flow .",
    "this symmetry breaking has been essential for the functioning of a dynamo in simulations of in a precessing sphere whereas it seemed less important in the direct numerical simulations of . however , preliminary kinematic dynamo simulations we conducted recently with an analytic flow of kelvin modes suggest that the joint appearance of contributions with @xmath125 and @xmath126 considerably facilitates the occurrence of dynamo action .",
    "the triadic instability requires a rather long time to emerge and saturates to a final state with slow periodic growth and decay .",
    "this period is likely related to the precession time scale but a conclusive correlation requires further simulations at different @xmath1 .",
    "the periodic growth followed by a fast decay of the free kelvin modes in the regime with triadic resonances reminds of the so called resonant collapse @xcite .",
    "however , in our simulations the energy is essentially distributed among very few , large scale modes .",
    "these modes are the fundamental forced mode and two free kelvin modes that establish the triad and an axisymmetric , essentially geostrophic mode .",
    "we do not spot any turbulence - like behavior during the decay of the free kelvin modes , i.e. there is no transition from the dominance of the large scale mode into small scale turbulent flow which would be characteristic for the collapse phenomenon .",
    "this behavior might change when the reynolds number approaches larger ( i.e. more realistic ) values .",
    "this is substantiated by the simulations at @xmath50 .",
    "here we see no triadic resonance , but rather a quasi - periodic occurrence of free kelvin modes that exhibit a trend towards larger radial wave numbers during their decay which may represent ( part of ) a cascade to small scale structures .    in principle",
    "the occurrence of very few dominant modes calls for a low - dimensional model . however , the ansatz  ( [ eq::triadenansatz ] ) used in this study to explain the occurrence of triadic resonances is too simplistic to allow for a reasonable description of the non - linear behavior and the saturation obtained in the simulations presented above .",
    "a more sophisticated approach is presented by   who use a low - dimensional model with four coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the amplitude of the forced mode , the free kelvin modes and an axisymmetric geostrophic mode .",
    "this model allows for saturation via the axisymmetric mode and for a reinforcement of the forced mode by the free kelvin modes and qualitatively reproduces the results obtained in our simulations .",
    "however , in order to yield a quantitative agreement , advanced models are still required .",
