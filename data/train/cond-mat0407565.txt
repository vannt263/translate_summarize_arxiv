    "one of the most characteristic properties of glasses is a maximum in the low frequency part of their inelastic scattering intensities .",
    "@xcite this maximum , the boson peak ( bp ) , originates from a maximum of the ratio @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of vibrational states which itself often has no corresponding maximum .",
    "@xcite the bp shows an excess of low frequency vibrations above the debye contribution of the sound waves .",
    "the bp is observed in experiments on raman scattering of light and inelastic neutron scattering within the frequency interval 0.5  2  thz .",
    "it is considered to be one of the universal properties of glasses and is found also in a number of other disordered systems ( see ref .  [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "disorder affects the vibrational states differently than it affects the electronic ones .",
    "the main point is that the matrix determining the eigenvalues of the harmonic vibrations , the squared frequencies , must satisfy the requirement of mechanical stability ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) . in other words",
    ", all eigenvalues must be positive , apart from the six zero values for translation and rotation of the system as a whole .",
    "other than in the case of electronic states , there is a fixed zero level .",
    "an arbitrary random matrix has no such property .",
    "this means that , in general , such a matrix corresponds to an unstable vibrational system .",
    "such a mechanical instability has often been observed in numerical simulations of disordered vibrational systems for sufficiently large degree of disorder ( _ cf .",
    "[ ] ) .    however , stability is restored automatically when the effects of anharmonicity are taken into account.@xcite a random matrix with the desired stability property is generated in a natural way by solving the corresponding nonlinear problem .",
    "it is remarkable that the density of states @xmath4 of such a `` stable matrix '' possesses the bp feature .",
    "the bp is a reminder of the former mechanical instability in the system .    for the proper interpretation of the bp ,",
    "the key problem is the nature of the vibrations that contribute to @xmath4 .",
    "since the term bp is used for any peak in the low frequency inelastic scattering intensity one has to distinguish between different cases . in some materials",
    "the bp is ascribed to low lying optical or transverse acoustic modes of parental crystals  @xcite or to librations of some molecules in plastic crystals .",
    "@xcite if these excitations have a small frequency spread they will show as a peak in @xmath4 .",
    "the role of disorder is merely to broaden modes which exist already without disorder . in the opposite case",
    "the excess of low frequency modes is caused by disorder itself .",
    "a simple example is realised in a metallic like model glass where the the parent crystal is fcc.@xcite in the present paper we discuss this latter case . between these two extreme cases of",
    "well defined low frequency modes , broadened by disorder , and no such modes before disorder , there is a range of materials having aspects of both . despite being derived for the case of a disorder - induced bp",
    ", our results will apply , at least semi - quantitatively , to these intermediate cases as long as the frequency spread of the relevant low frequency modes is sufficiently large .",
    "starting point of our investigation are the ubiquitously occurring quasilocal ( or resonant ) harmonic vibrations ( qlv ) .",
    "these vibrations can be understood as a low frequency vibration of a small group of atoms which has a weak bilinear interaction with the continuum of acoustic vibrations of the whole system .",
    "they share many properties of the localized vibrations but are different from these exact harmonic eigenstates .",
    "they can be seen as resonances in the low frequency part of the local spectra of the set of atoms involved . in mbauer experiments",
    "one observes anomalously large debye - waller factors for the atoms vibrating with such qlv @xcite . in simulations",
    "the qlv are seen in the harmonic eigenstates as `` low frequency localized modes '' or mixed into the extended modes .",
    "this is found for the textbook case of a heavy mass defect as well as for qlv in glasses @xcite .",
    "a `` low frequency localized mode '' of a small system does not vanish when the system becomes larger  it just hybridizes with the other modes of similar frequency . if one looks at the modes around the qlv - frequency one still finds an additional eigenmode .",
    "a more detailed discussion of qlv with emphasis on glasses can be found in our previous work on the boson peak @xcite where one can also find supporting references .    in the soft potential model",
    "@xcite one describes the low frequency vibrations of the defect system in the harmonic approximation utilizing a basis of ( extended ) sound waves and local oscillators .",
    "the latter are the cores of the qlv or `` bare qlv '' which have been found to extend over several atoms @xcite . in this basis",
    "there is a bilinear interaction which is treated as a perturbation .",
    "in a glass one has a finite concentration of qlv s .",
    "as discussed in our previous paper@xcite , this has a profound effect on their density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the interaction of the qlv s with the sound waves induces an elastic dipole interaction between them .",
    "first , the interaction of soft qlv s with surrounding qlv s of higher frequency may lead in harmonic approximation to unstable modes .",
    "stability is restored by the anharmonic terms .",
    "this leads to a linear density of states , @xmath5 , for @xmath6 where @xmath7 is determined by the typical interaction strength .",
    "secondly , these renormalized low frequency qlv s interact with each other . in effect",
    "this means that the qlv s are subject to random forces , @xmath8 , later referred to as _",
    "internal forces_. due to the high susceptibility of low frequency vibrations their low frequency dos is changed to @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "this is a general property of the low frequency dos of non - goldstone bosonic excitations in random media @xcite and has been discussed in numerous papers on low energy excitations in glasses , see refs .",
    "it is associated with the so - called _ sea - gull singularity _ in the distribution of the stiffness constants of the qlv  @xcite in the soft potential model@xcite .",
    "this sea - gull singularity has also been observed in computer simulations @xcite .    by the crossover between the two limiting regimes of the dos",
    "the bp is formed and obtains a `` universal '' shape .",
    "the frequency of the bp , @xmath1 , is again determined by the interaction strength and thus by the characteristic value of the internal forces , @xmath11 ( in ref .",
    "[ ] this quantity was denoted as @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 with higher interaction @xmath1 is shifted upwards and the intensity of the bp is reduced @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of the boson peak in glasses is its shift towards higher frequencies under application of hydrostatic pressure . in the present paper",
    "we will show that such a shift can be visualized as a result of a simple physical mechanism .",
    "if one applies a pressure @xmath0 onto a specimen of glass the internal random forces acquire additional random contributions @xmath14 proportional to the pressure . as a result ,",
    "one obtains a  blue \" shift of the boson peak frequency with pressure . for small pressure",
    "this pressure contribution is small compared to the characteristic value of internal forces @xmath11 and the shift of the bp is linear in the pressure . with increasing pressure @xmath14",
    "can become larger than @xmath11 and the bp shifts as @xmath15 .",
    "in the present section we will briefly derive , in analogy to ref .  [ ] , the random force distribution under an applied hydrostatic pressure . from hook s law one gets @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the strain tensor and",
    "@xmath18 is the compressibility of the glass .",
    "the interaction of a qlv with the strain is bilinear  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the deformation potential tensor and @xmath21 is the coordinate of the qlv . for simplicity we will write in the following @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 .",
    "thus the additional contribution to the random force due to applied pressure is proportional to the pressure @xmath24 the deformation potential @xmath22 of a qlv is a random quantity . in particular",
    ", it has a random sign , so that the corresponding distribution function @xmath25 is an even function of @xmath22 . as a result",
    "the distribution of the random forces @xmath26 in the glass remains an even function of @xmath26 when the pressure is applied .",
    "the total random force @xmath26 is a sum of two contributions @xmath27 here @xmath8 is the internal random force in the absence of pressure . if the distribution of the internal forces @xmath8 is @xmath28 then the distribution of the total random force @xmath26 in a glass under pressure is given by the convolution @xmath29 for @xmath30 it reduces to the unperturbed distribution @xmath28 since the distribution @xmath25 is normalized to unity . in the appendix",
    "we give the results of the convolution for three cases which should be typical , namely two types of lorentzian distributions and a gaussian distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us discuss how random forces change the frequencies of the qlv s . in a purely harmonic case , the linear forces would not affect the frequencies .",
    "anharmonicity , however , renormalizes the relevant part of the spectrum  @xcite . although the qlv s are essentially harmonic vibrations their frequencies under applied forces can be shifted as in the usual quasi - harmonic approximation .    to start the description of a qlv ,",
    "consider an anharmonic oscillator under the action of a random static force  @xmath26 @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the oscillator frequency in the harmonic approximation and @xmath33 is the constant of anharmonicity .",
    "the role of the omitted third order term as well as that of the distribution of @xmath33 will be discussed further on .",
    "the force @xmath26 shifts the equilibrium position from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , given by @xmath36 where the oscillator has a new _ harmonic _ frequency @xmath37    if @xmath38 is the distribution function of frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath39 is the distribution of random forces in a glass under pressure , then the pressure dependent renormalized dos is given by @xmath40    integrating the @xmath41-function with regard of eqs .",
    "( [ xce8 ] ) and  ( [ kiu6 ] ) we get @xmath42 here @xmath43    as shown in ref .  [ ] and shortly discussed in section ii the interaction of high and low frequency qlv lead to a linear dos in the relevant frequency range . in writing eq .  [ ao1 ] we took qlv already including this effect .",

    "thus for @xmath51 , @xmath52 while for @xmath53 , @xmath54 .    according to ref .",

    ". one can replace this function by @xmath58 . according to eq .",
    "( [ des5 ] ) , @xmath59 .",
    "thus at high pressures @xmath53 , @xmath60 in the opposite case @xmath61 the integral over @xmath62 is dominated by such values of @xmath62 near the upper limit that @xmath63 after integration , making use of the normalization of @xmath64 , we regain the equation for the unperturbed pressure - independent linear density of states @xmath65 as it should be . for higher @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) the linear dos produced by the interaction between the qlv will be modified and @xmath68 shows material dependent deviations .",
    "[ fig_g_om2_p ] shows the frequency dependence of the bp for different applied pressures .",
    "both the distributions of internal forces @xmath8 and of the deformation potentials @xmath22 were approximated by lorentzians centered at 0 .",
    "after convolution a broadened lorentzian is obtained , eq .",
    "( [ 7ygt ] ) .",
    "one clearly observes the pronounced flattening with pressure of the low frequency part of the bp .",
    "contrary to this , the high frequency part is not affected . in calculating the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_g_om2_p ] we assumed @xmath69 . in real materials , this linearity of the dos will only hold up to some frequency @xmath7 . above that frequency",
