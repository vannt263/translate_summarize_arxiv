    "absorption lines occurring very close to the quasar redshift  associated absorbers  are potentially valuable probes of quasar environments .",
    "the precise origin of the absorbing material is unknown , but many interesting regions along the sightline may contribute .",
    "absorption may arise , for instance , in gas near the quasar nucleus , in the ism of the host galaxy or in neighbouring galaxies .",
    "it seems clear that the majority of associated absorption systems ( as defined by @xmath2kms@xmath3 ) are related directly to the quasar phenomenon , rather than being due solely to cosmologically - distributed foreground galaxies .",
    "first , the density of associated absorption systems per redshift interval is greater than expected for intervening galactic systems alone ( foltz et al .",
    "1988 , richards et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "secondly , the characteristics of the absorbers depend on quasar type .",
    "narrow absorption lines occur more frequently in radio - loud quasars , especially those with steep radio spectra ( anderson et al .",
    "1987 ; foltz et al . 1988 ; richards et al .",
    "1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , optically - selected samples might be biased against objects with absorption .",
    "previous studies have interpreted the prevalence of @xmath4  systems in steep - spectrum and lobe - dominated quasars in terms of orientation ( barthel , tytler & vestergaard 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath4  systems differ subtly in ionisation or velocity profiles from those seen along sightlines traversing normal galaxy halos , consistent with their proximity to the agn ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "a major limitation of most previous studies of @xmath4  absorption is that they have used inhomogeneous samples which are prone to strong selection effects . to counter this ,",
    "we have observed @xmath4  absorption in quasars drawn from a complete sample of 408-mhz selected quasars . low - frequency radio selection and a high completeness level",
    "ensure that orientation bias is minimised and reddened sightlines are included .",
    "the initial results of this study , correlations between c  iv  absorption and quasar properties , are summarised here .",
    "full results will be published shortly ( baker et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "cosmological parameters @xmath5 kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are assumed for consistency with our earlier work .",
    "we have obtained intermediate - resolution spectroscopy of the c  iv  to ly@xmath8  spectral region for 43 quasars drawn from the complete molonglo quasar sample ( mqs ; kapahi et al .",
    "1998 ; baker et al . 1999 ) .",
    "briefly , the mqs comprises all quasars in the @xmath9 strip of the 408-mhz molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ; large et al .",
    "1981 ) down to a limiting flux density of @xmath10  jy .",
    "the mqs contains 111 quasars with @xmath11 .",
    "mqs quasars were selected for the absorption study in two redshift ranges , @xmath12 where redshifted c  iv  is observable from the ground , and @xmath13 which was observed in the uv using stis on hst .",
    "ground - based spectra with spectral resolution 12.4  ( fwhm ) were obtained for 22 out of a total of 27 mqs quasars with @xmath14 , using mostly the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) and the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "in addition , four faint quasars were observed with fors1 on the vlt ( ut1 ) .",
    "the stis spectroscopy was carried out between may 1999 and february 2001 for 19 mqs quasars with redshifts @xmath13 .",
    "the nuv - mama detector was used with the g230l grism , giving a spectral resolution of 3.0  over the wavelength range 15703180 .",
    "absorption systems were identified and measured using iraf .",
    "the strongest absorption system was identified in each spectrum within @xmath15kms@xmath3  of the c  iv  emission - line redshift .",
    "the majority ( 5070% ) of the resulting systems lay within @xmath16kms@xmath3  of the emission redshift , and were both blue- and red - shifted .",
    "although not shown explicitly in this short contribution , we do confirm the trends for absorption to be most prevalent in steep - spectrum and lobe - dominated quasars ( e.g. anderson et al .",
    "1997 ; foltz et al .",
    "1988 ; barthel et al .",
    "in our mqs study , for example , strong absorption ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) was detected exclusively in steep - spectrum ( @xmath19 ) quasars in both the high- and low - redshift sub - samples .      in the mqs data ,",
    "the most striking result is that the strongest absorption occurs preferentially in the smallest radio sources .",
    "the equivalent widths of c  iv  absorption are plotted as a function of radio source size in figure [ ewl ] for both high- and low - redshift datasets .",
    "highly beamed core - dominated quasars are excluded as they are expected to be severely foreshortened .",
    "compact , steep - spectrum ( css ) sources are included on the plot .",
    "css sources ( see review by odea 1998 ) are intrinsically small ( @xmath20 kpc ) with steep radio spectra ( @xmath21 where @xmath22 ) .",
    "the precise definition of csss is somewhat arbitrary , comprising essentially those sources whose radio emission was unbeamed ( not core - dominated ) yet unresolved with conventional arrays ( arcsec resolution ) .",
    "thus css sources do include intrinsically small , and perhaps young , sources .",
    "radio sizes for the css quasars in the mqs study were measured from merlin images with @xmath23 resolution ( de silva et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "notably , all the css quasars in our study ( except an unusual gigahertz - peaked spectrum source ) show @xmath4  absorption stronger than @xmath24 .      for quasars where c  iv  absorption was detected ,",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption is plotted in figure [ ewaopt ] against the slope of the optical spectrum , @xmath25 ( as observed between 3500 and 10000 ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation between absorption - line strength and spectral slope  heavily absorbed quasars are systematically redder .",
    "baker & hunstead ( 1995 ) and baker ( 1997 ) presented evidence that the range in optical spectral slope observed in the mqs is due in part to reddening by an anisotropic dust screen lying outside the broad emission - line region . in this earlier study , the most direct evidence for dust reddening ( as opposed to intrinsic spectral steepening ) was the tight correlation between @xmath25  and broad h@xmath8/h@xmath26  balmer decrement , at least in low - redshift quasars where it was measurable in the optical .",
    "the reader is referred to baker ( 1997 ) for this result and a more detailed description of the dust - reddening hypothesis . by extension ,",
    "the simplest explanation of the correlation of @xmath27 with @xmath25  is that the absorbing gas clouds contain dust , and they lie outside the nuclear continuum source .",
    "alternatively , if dust is not responsible for the red continuum slopes , then c  iv  absorption strength correlates with an intrinsically softer continuum shape .",
    "these results suggest that the distribution of associated absorbers in quasars is dependent on _ both orientation and radio size_. orientation explains the trends with radio spectral index and radio - core dominance , as described by barthel et al .",
    "orientation , however , can not explain the stronger absorption in css sources and the global decrease in absorbing column density with radio size .    the radio - size dependence of associated absorption may be explained if the absorption column density either correlates with quasar environmental density , or changes with time .",
    "currently , the first hypothesis is not supported by observations , which find that css host galaxies appear to be the same as those harbouring larger sources , and css quasars do not systematically reside in clusters more often than larger sources ( de vries et al .",
    "2000 ; odea 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the alternative idea is that the absorbing column density decreases as the radio source grows .",
    "this could occur because of photoionisation of the clouds by the quasar over time , or by direct interaction of the radio jet and its cocoon on the absorbing clouds , or both .",
    "the strong correlation between the c  iv  absorption strength and red continuum in the quasars is highly suggestive of dust in the absorbing clouds .",
    "however , a cospatial distribution of dust and gas is problematic , dust should be destroyed by sputtering in the hot gas where c  iv  absorption arises .",
    "de young ( 1998 ) points out that the strong shocks in radio - source environments should destroy dust easily on timescales @xmath28 yrs , which is much shorter than the lifetime of the radio source .",
    "putting all the evidence together , we propose a consistent model whereby radio sources are born enshrouded in dust and gas , which is gradually destroyed and ionised ( respectively ) along the radio axis as the source expands .",
    "in addition , we find no evidence for changes in the the frequency or strength of the absorbers with redshift from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "this lack of evolution is perhaps unexpected given the absorbers are probably at kpc distances where they should be affected by quasar environmental and perhaps galactic evolution .",
    "initial results from a study of c  iv  associated absorption in a complete , homogeneous sample of radio - loud quasars are presented .",
    "the results confirm that the absorbing cloud distribution is anisotropic , such that absorption is more common in steep - spectrum and lobe - dominated quasars .",
    "furthermore , we find new evidence that the strength of c  iv  absorption decreases with increasing radio source size .",
    "if we assume that the larger sources are older than the smaller ( css ) ones , then we can attribute the decrease in column density to the growth of the radio source envelope through the ism .",
    "the absorbing clouds probably contain dust , which reddens the quasar light .",
    "consequently we predict that absorbed quasars will be missed preferentially in optically - selected samples . finally , these results appear to be independent of redshift , giving essentially the same picture at @xmath31 and @xmath30 , epochs between which evolution of quasar environments should be discernible .",
    "thus we are drawn to a picture where radio sources are born in gaseous and dusty cocoons , from which they emerge as their radio jets expand beyond the host galaxy ."
