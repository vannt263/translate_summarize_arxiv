    "it is well known that core - collapse supernova simulations require a detailed description of neutrino transport including all potentially important neutrino reactions  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are the mediators of the energy transfer from the core to the outer stellar layers and their luminosities and spectra are a crucial ingredient for the supernova explosion mechanism . despite significant progress in our understanding of the core - collapse mechanism",
    ", many supernova simulations fail to produce explosion ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the possible reasons for this failure could be the incomplete and inaccurate treatment of the neutrino - nucleus processes occurring in supernova environments .",
    "it was pointed by haxton  @xcite that neutral- and charged - current neutrino reactions on nuclei involving the excitation of the giant resonances might help reenergize the explosion and they should , therefore , be taken into account in supernova simulations .",
    "such simulations were performed by bruenn and haxton  @xcite and it was shown that inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering plays an important role in equilibrating neutrinos with matter .",
    "however , the simulations did not confirm haxton s suggestion that neutrino - nucleus reactions might help to revive the stalled shock wave .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the nuclear composition of the core was approximated by a single representative nucleus , @xmath0fe , and the relevant cross sections and rates were evaluated considering only allowed ( gamow - teller ) and first - forbidden upward transitions from the nuclear ground state . however , in the hot supernova environment with temperatures @xmath3  mev nuclei exist as a thermal ensemble , i.e. , nuclear excited states are thermally populated according to the boltzmann distribution . as was first realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , downward transitions from excited states remove the reaction threshold and can significantly enhance the reaction cross section at low neutrino energies .    from a microscopic point of view",
    ", there are two ways how to treat neutrino reactions with hot nuclei .",
    "the first one involves a state - by - state summation over boltzmann - weighted , individually determined contributions from nuclear ground and excited states . to apply this method",
    ", one needs to know the strength distribution of electro - weak transition operators for thermally populated nuclear states .",
    "the second method is based on a statistical formulation of the nuclear many - body problem . in this approach rather than computing individual strength distributions",
    "one determines an `` average '' temperature - dependent strength function .    for iron group nuclei ( @xmath4 )",
    "the first approach was developed in  @xcite on the basis of large - scale shell - model ( lssm ) diagonalization calculations .",
    "modern high - performance compute capabilities combined with state - of - the - art diagonalization approaches are able to provide detailed strength distributions for both charge - neutral and charge - changing gamow - teller transitions that dominate neutrino reactions with @xmath5-shell iron group nuclei at low neutrino energies ( @xmath6 ) . however , at temperatures @xmath7 an explicit state - by - state summation over all thermally populated states presently remains computationally prohibitive . to overcome",
    "this problem the `` brink hypothesis '' is applied , i.e. , it is assumed that gt distributions on nuclear excited states are the same as for the ground state . to account for thermal effects , the giant resonances built on the ground and low - lying daughter states in the inverse reaction are considered .",
    "such excited states are called back - resonances and their importance arises from the large nuclear matrix elements and increased phase space .",
    "thus , within lssm calculations the temperature dependence of the cross sections is comprised solely in the back - resonance terms .    within the shell model approach it is assumed that the gt distributions on thermally excited states are the same as for the ground state .",
    "this is not likely the case as the vanishing of pairing correlations and smearing of the fermi surface with increasing temperature should affect the distribution centroid and move it slightly down in energy .",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by shell model monte carlo studies performed at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , with present compute capabilities the shell - model diagonalization can not be applied for nuclei beyond the @xmath5-shell because of the huge configurational spacse involved .",
    "these shortcomings can be avoided in a thermal quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( tqrpa ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the tqrpa was proposed as a method to study the response of hot nuclei to weak external perturbations in the framework of a statistical approach .",
    "being based on the thermo - field dynamics ( tfd ) formalism  @xcite , the tqrpa enables the computation of temperature - dependent strength function avoiding the assumption of brink s hypothesis . in  @xcite",
    ", the tqrpa was applied to study thermal effects on neutral - current inelastic neutrino scattering on @xmath8fe and neutron - rich germanium isotope @xmath1ge .",
    "it was shown that the tqrpa reveals the same thermal effects on the cross sections as the lssm approach .",
    "namely , the reaction threshold for inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering is removed at finite temperature and the cross section for low - energy neutrinos is significantly enhanced .",
    "it was found , however , that within the tqrpa the enhancement is caused by both de - excitation of nuclear excited states and thermally unblocked low - energy gt transitions .",
    "the latter do not appear within the lssm due to application of brink s hypothesis .",
    "moreover , it was shown in  @xcite that , unlike in the lssm approach , the principle of detailed balance is not violated within the tqrpa and it results in a larger strength for downward gt transitions from excited states . as a consequence , at low neutrino energies the finite temperature cross sections calculated within the tqrpa turn out to be several times larger than those obtained within the shell - model calculations .    in the present paper , we apply the tqrpa method to study thermal effects on charged - current neutrino - nucleus reactions @xmath9 and @xmath10 occurring in the supernova environment .",
    "here we would like to mention that the tqrpa was already applied for charge - changing reactions with hot nuclei when studying thermal effects on electron capture in supernovae  @xcite .",

    "during the core - collapse phase of a supernovae explosion the temperature in the iron core is sufficiently high ( a few @xmath13  k ) to establish an equilibrium of reactions mediated by the strong and electro - weak interaction  @xcite . neglecting weak - interaction reactions",
    ", we can consider nuclei as open quantum systems in thermal equilibrium with heat and particle reservoirs and , hence , they can be described as a thermal grand canonical ensemble with temperature @xmath14 and proton and neutron chemical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . in tfd , such ensemble",
    "is represented by the thermal vacuum @xmath17 , which is a temperature - dependent state in the extended hilbert space  .",

    "external perturbations mediated by weak interaction induce transitions from the thermal vacuum to nonequilibrium states . within the tdf",
    "such nonequilibrium states are given by the eigenstates of the thermal hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "as follows from the definition of @xmath27 , each of its eigenstates with positive energy has a counterpart  the tilde - conjugate eigenstate  with negative but the same absolute value of energy .",
    "this gives the possibility to describe both endoergic and exoergic neutrino reactions with hot nuclei .",
    "in what follows we will refer to positive energy eigenstates as non - tilde states , and to negative energy eigenstates as tilde states .      in",
    "@xcite we have introduced the proton - neutron tqrpa method which allows for a treatment of charge - changing transitions in hot nuclei induced by ( anti)neutrino absorption . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us briefly recall the method .    within the tqrpa ,",
    "nonequilibrium states of a hot nucleus caused by an external perturbation are treated as phonon - like excitations on the thermal vacuum @xmath28 where we denote @xmath29 .",
    "phonon excitations are considered as the normal modes of the thermal hamiltonian : @xmath30 while the thermal vacuum @xmath17 itself is the vacuum for the annihilation operators @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",

    "the last two types are possible only at @xmath51",
    ". therefore , due to single - particle transitions involving annihilation of thermally excited bogoliubov quasiparticles , the phonon spectrum at finite temperature contains negative- and low - energy states which do not exist at zero temperature and these `` new '' phonon states can be interpreted as thermally unblocked transitions between nuclear excited states .    to find the energy and the wavefunctions of thermal phonons",
