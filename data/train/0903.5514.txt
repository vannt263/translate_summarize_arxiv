    "since the pioneering papers by berezinskii @xcite and kosterlitz and thouless @xcite finite temperature phase transitions in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems , which have a continuous symmetry specified by a phase , have become a very active research field .",
    "it turned out that two dimensional superfluids @xcite as well as thin superconducting films @xcite have a berezinskii  kosterlitz ",
    "thouless(bkt ) transition at a finite temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the low - temperature phase is superfluid ( superconducting ) and has quasi - long range order , while the disordered high - temperature is normal liquid ( metallic ) for superfluids ( superconductors ) .",
    "these systems are successfully described by the 2d xy model , see eq .",

    "theoretical predictions were confirmed experimentally : a universal jump in the superfluid density at @xmath0 @xcite and different current - voltage characteristics of superconducting films below and above @xmath0 @xcite .    introducing disorder through random phase shifts in the 2d xy model physics becomes more complex .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2d xy model with random phase shifts reads @xcite @xmath2 where the sum runs over all nearest neighboring sites on a square lattice .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the phase of the order parameter , while @xmath4 are quenched random phase shifts on bonds of the square lattice produced by some kind of disorder .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 are gaussian distributed , uncorrelated , have the zero mean @xmath5 and the variance @xmath6 .",
    "the pure 2d xy model contains two different kinds of excitations which are decoupled .",
    "the spin - wave excitations describe small changes of the phase @xmath7 and do not drive any phase transitions .",
    "another kind of excitations are vortices , topological excitations , and they are essential for the existence of a bkt transition in the 2d xy model at @xmath0 .",
    "vortices are bound in pairs in the low - temperature phase , and unbound at high temperatures . introducing the disorder in the form of random phase shifts",
    ", the low - temperature superconducting phase survives for weak enough disorder , as has been shown first analytically @xcite and then numerically @xcite .",

    "it is a ferromagnet - superconductor hybrid system .",
    "the system consists of a thin superconducting film covered by magnetic dots with permanent , but random magnetization . for more details about hybrid systems",
    "see recent reviews @xcite .",
    "we will show that our system can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) under some conditions defined below .",
    "knowing the solution of the model ( [ h ] ) we can establish possible phases of the system .    placed on top of the film , a single magnetic dot with sufficiently large magnetization , normal to the film surface , induces and pins vortices and antivortices around it @xcite .",
    "a regular lattice of magnetic dots with constant and equal magnetization is the source of a periodic pinning potential for vortices in the film .",
    "the magnetic dots induce periodic arrays of vortices and antivortices in the film , provided the dot magnetization is high enough @xcite . the periodic pinning",
    "is absent in the case of a random dot magnetization , and there magnetic dots are a source of disordered pinning potential for vortices .",
    "lyuksyutov and pokrovsky @xcite considered a superconducting film with a magnetic dots array with random , sufficiently strong magnetic moments and concluded that the dot array induces the resistive state in the film .",
    "they have not considered the case when magnetic moments are weak . in this paper",
    "we will show that the superconducting state survives provided the disorder is not too strong .",
    "hybrid systems with a regular lattice of magnetic dots with random magnetization @xcite , and without a lattice , but homogeneously distributed dots on top of a thin superconducting film @xcite have been recently experimentally realized .",
    "in the rest of the paper in section ii we introduce the model for our hybrid system and give its solution by mapping it to the model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "section iii contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "some technical details are postponed to the appendix .",
    "we consider a thin superconducting film characterized by the london penetration depth @xmath8 , the coherence length @xmath9 , a thickness @xmath10 and a typical lateral dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the london penetration depth is in general temperature dependent and we assume that our film has the effective penetration depth @xmath12 that exceeds film s lateral dimension @xmath11 . this limit is valid for `` dirty '' superconducting films @xcite . in addition , provided the bulk critical temperature is larger than a critical temperature @xmath0 for vortex unbinding , the film has a bkt transition at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we consider the dots with permanent random magnetization placed on top of the film .",
    "they produce a random potential @xmath13 for vortices in the film . assuming vortices of vorticities @xmath14 are places on a quadratic lattice with the lattice constant @xmath15 ( which is of the order of the coherence length ) , the effective lattice hamiltonian for the system may be written as @xmath16+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\neq j}n_i n_j u_{vv}(\\rho_{ij}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all lattice sites , @xmath17 , the flux quantum is @xmath18",

    "( [ hvnew ] ) penalizes the total energy for nonzero total vorticities @xcite , so one has @xmath32 .",
    "then , a superconducting film described by the model ( [ hvnew ] ) has a bkt transition at the temperature @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denoted that one should take value @xmath35 renormalized by the presence of vortices @xcite .",
    "next , we consider effects of the random potential .",
    "first we consider the case when the dots have random magnetization parallel to the film surface . we model them as magnetic dipoles placed on top of the film at lattice sites . to characterize statistical properties of the dots , we assume that the @xmath36 and @xmath37 components of the magnetic moment at site @xmath20 are gaussian distributed , have zero mean value and are uncorrelated from site to site : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes an average over disorder . since the dots have random magnetic moments , @xmath40 is the measure for a typical magnetic moment of a magnetic dot at some lattice site .",
    "the interaction energy between a single dot having the magnetic moment @xmath41 parallel to the film surface and a vortex of vorticity @xmath42 placed at a relative distance @xmath43 from the dot can be calculated using the approach developed in ref .",

    "notice that the interaction energy between the magnetic dipole and the vortex can be simply written in the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the magnetic field produced by the vortex at the dipole position @xcite . in the limit @xmath50 the interaction energy ( [ umvperp ] ) reads @xmath51 the random site potential @xmath19 is given as a sum over the lattice @xmath52 by summing over @xmath53 in the previous expression we avoid the short scale cutoff divergence of the interaction energy ( [ umvperp ] ) at @xmath54 , which exists because the dots are placed at the top of the film in our model .",
    "in reality magnetic dipoles are separated from the film surface by some small distance @xmath55 . since @xmath19 is a sum of",
    "many independent random variables it is gaussian distributed ( notice here that the assumption about gaussian distribution for @xmath56 is not necessary condition for @xmath19 to be gaussian distributed ; it is sufficient that dots have a distribution with a finite variance ) .",
    "its mean , variance and site to site correlations can be calculated and read @xmath57    the model ( [ hvnew ] ) with the disorder potential ( [ vi ] ) which has properties ( [ v : mean ] ) , ( [ v : variance ] ) and ( [ v : sitetosite ] ) matches the vortex part of the 2d xy model with random phase shifts @xcite . from the solution of the model ( [ h ] )",
    "@xcite we know its phase diagram , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .",

( [ hvnew ] ) which compares the energy loss for the single vortex creation and the energy gain due to disorder fluctuations also gives the critical value ( [ mcritical ] ) for zero temperature . the connection between @xmath62 introduced as the disorder strength in eq .",

    "we may conclude that the system with magnetic moments normal to the film has the same phase diagram as in the case of moments parallel to the film surface .",
    "having shown the equivalence between our system and the vortex part of the 2d xy model with random phase shifts , we may infer some properties of the former . the phase diagram is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] . the low temperature and low disorder phase is superconducting . there vortices and antivortices are bound in pairs . the current  voltage characteristic for @xmath73 and @xmath74 and for weak disorder",
    "is expected to be very similar to the one of halperin and nelson @xcite for the pure case , @xmath75 , possibly with a small correction due to the disorder .",
    "this phase has zero linear resistivity .",
    "the high temperature phase is metallic and has a nonzero linear resistivity .",
    "there free vortices dissipate energy and produce the linear current  voltage characteristic @xmath76 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the conclusion about the resistive state of the film when the dots with normal magnetization are present relies on the assumption that the randomly magnetized dots pin vortices of vorticity @xmath77 .",
    "these pinned vortices serve as a source of the random potential for other bound vortices , which unbind and fill deep valleys of the random potential .",
    "these unbound vortices lead to the resistive state of the film .",
    "we agree that this scenario occurs for sufficiently strong disorder when the dots can induce and pin vortices .",
    "a single dot can induce and pin quite different configurations of vortices and antivortices regarding its magnetic moment@xcite .",
    "we expect that a random lattice of dots can also pin , from site to site , quite a different number of vortices and antivortices which produce different potential than one assumed in ref .",
    "however , our conclusion , that the resistive state in films occurs when the disorder is sufficiently strong , agrees with the one from ref .",
    "moreover , we give the strength of the disorder above which the resistive state occurs .    by making a comparison between @xmath78 and the magnetic moment @xmath79 of a single magnetic dot with normal magnetization necessary to induce and pin an extra vortex in the film , we obtain @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the distance between the dipole and the film surface .",
    "in addition , knowing that the value @xmath78 corresponds not to typical but rare magnetic moments from the tail of distribution @xcite , we may conclude that even a very rare magnetic dot in the film that has the magnetic moment @xmath78 is not able to induce and pin vortices .",
    "such pinned vortices served as a source of random potential in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have considered the dots as magnetic dipoles .",
    "this fact is unimportant as long as the dot size is not too big with respect to the lattice constant .",
    "what is crucial for any kind of magnetic dots is their interaction with a vortex which decays as @xmath82 , which is universal for any geometrical shape of dots , when the vortex is sufficiently far from the dot .",
    "the magnetic field produced by a vortex decays as @xmath82 and the interaction energy dot  vortex universally decays , regardless of the shape of the dot .",
    "this form of the interaction produces logarithmically diverging , with the system size , variance of the disorder potential that is characteristic for the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "recently , the question of a possible third phase for strong disorder and at low temperatures has been raised in numerical studies of the model ( [ h ] ) with uniformly random phase @xmath4 in the interval @xmath83 $ ] with @xmath84 , with conflicting results about its existence @xcite .",
    "while for @xmath85 @xcite it is accepted that the superconducting phase survives at low temperature , the case @xmath86 is still under debate .",
    "an experimental study of josephson junction arrays with positional disorder @xcite supports the existence the third phase .",
    "the new phase is superconducting according to the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite and numerical investigations of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the limit @xmath87",
    "the model ( [ h ] ) and the so - called gauge glass limit , @xmath88 , are equivalent , and we expect that the conjectures about the phase diagram for the case of uniformly distributed phase apply as well to the gaussian distribution of the phase .",
    "the existence of the third phase is a challenging question that could be experimentally resolved by using magneto - superconducting hybrid systems as a realization for the model ( [ h ] ) .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that a thin superconducting film covered by magnetic dots with random magnetization provides an experimental realization for the two - dimensional xy model with random phase shifts .",
    "the phase diagram of the latter model helped us to conclude that a low - temperature superconducting phase of a superconducting film without dots survives when the dots are placed on top of the film , provided their magnetization is not too large .",
