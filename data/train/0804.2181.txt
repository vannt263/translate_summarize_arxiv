    "multiplication in polynomial algebras @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] over a field  @xmath2 has been intensively studied in the computer - algebra literature . since the discovery of karatsuba s algorithm and the fast fourier transform ,",
    "hundreds of articles have been dedicated to theoretical and practical issues ; see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  8) , @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "not only are many other operations built upon multiplication , but often their complexity can be expressed in terms of the complexity of multiplication  whether as a constant number of multiplications or a logarithmic number of multiplications . in  @xmath0 $ ] , this is the case for euclidean division , gcd and resultant computation , multipoint evaluation and interpolation , shifts , certain changes of bases , etc .    in the noncommutative setting of linear ordinary differential operators ,",
    "the study is by far less advanced .",
    "the complexity of the product has been addressed only recently , by van  der  hoeven in the short paper  @xcite : multiplication of operators over ground fields  @xmath2 of characteristic zero can be reduced by an evaluation - interpolation scheme to a constant number  @xmath3 of matrix multiplications with elements in  @xmath2 .",
    "work in progress  @xcite suggests that linear algebra is again the bottleneck for computations of gcrds and lclms .",
    "this work aims at deepening the study started in  @xcite for characteristic  0 .",
    "we improve van der hoeven s result along several directions : we make the constant factor  @xmath3 explicit in   [ ssec : mattooper ] and improve it in   [ sec : better - constants ] , and we prove in   [ sec : equiv ] that multiplication of matrices and of differential operators are equivalent computational problems  that is , they share the same exponent , thus answering the question left open in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , remark  2 ) . as usual ,",
    "those results hold for sufficiently large characteristic as well .",
    "we prolong the study to the case of ( small ) positive characteristic , by giving in   [ sec : positive - char ] an algorithm for computing the product of two differential operators in softly quadratic complexity , that is , nearly optimally in the output size .",
    "this indicates that the equivalence result may fail to generalize to arbitrary fields .    in what follows",
    ", the field @xmath2 has characteristic zero , unless stated otherwise .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -7pt    comparing the columns rec and , for instance , s , shows that linear algebra does not take the main part of the calculation time , although its theoretical complexity dominates . in this regard",
    ", we have been very cautious in our implementation to avoid any interpreted quadratic loops . still , the result is that those quadratic tasks dominate the computation time .",
    "details are given in table  [ table : percentages ] .",
    "the conclusion is that having implemented the algorithms in an interpreted language tends to parasitize the benchmarks . for comparison sake",
    ", we have also added timings for variants bzi and vdhi that use an interpreted matrix product .",
    "they both show the growth expected in theory , as well as the ratio from  8 to  96 announced in table  [ table : mm ] .",
    "because of space limitation , various extensions could not be covered here .",
    "more results on the complexity of non - commutative multiplication of skew polynomials will be presented in an upcoming extended version  @xcite .",
    "topics like multiplication of skew polynomials with unbalanced degrees and orders , or with sparse support , will be treated there .",
    "the case of rational ( instead of polynomial ) coefficients will also be considered .",
    "the methods of this article extend to multiplication of more general skew polynomials , in one or several variables , including for instance @xmath8-recurrences and partial differential operators .",
    "the constants in table  [ table : mm ] are all somewhat pessimistic .",
    "tighter bounds can be obtained by , on the one hand , relaxing the naive assumption  , on the other hand , taking advantage of the special shapes ( banded , trapezoidal , etc ) of the various matrices .",
