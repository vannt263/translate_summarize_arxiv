    "the international muon ionization cooling experiment ( mice)@xcite is designed to measure muon ionization cooling@xcite .",
    "cooling is needed for neutrino factories based on muon decay ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in storage rings@xcite and for muon colliders@xcite .",
    "two high - density aerogel threshold cherenkov counters@xcite , located just after the first time of flight counter ( tof0 ) in the mice beamline , are used in support of muon and pion particle identification .",
    "the measured  @xcite refractive indices of the aerogels in the counters are @xmath2 in ckov - a and @xmath3 in ckov - b .",
    "the corresponding momentum thresholds for muons ( pions ) are at 280.5 ( 367.9 ) and 217.9 ( 285.8 ) mev/@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "light is collected in each counter by four 9354 kb eight - inch uv - enhanced phototubes and recorded by caen v1731 500ms / s flash adcs ( fadcs ) .",
    "a charge - integration algorithm identifies charge clusters @xmath58 in the fadcs where the adc value crosses a threshold , marking times @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the threshold crossings , approximating the pulse beginning and end times .",
    "the time @xmath8 at the cluster signal maximum is found .",
    "the charges are converted to a photoelectron count @xmath9 , by subtracting a pedestal @xmath10 and then normalizing by the single photoelectron charge @xmath11 for each phototube . for all @xmath12 , the total charge , arrival time , @xmath6 , and @xmath8",
    "are stored per event .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath13=1 light yield @xmath14 in each counter is measured using the electron peak in mice calibration - beam runs , giving 25 and 16 photoelectrons ( pe s ) in ckov - b and ckov - a , respectively , for a nominal run .",
    "the photoelectron yields versus momentum are displayed in fig .",
    "[ p_thresholds ] .",
    "the observed muon thresholds , @xmath15 and @xmath16  mev/@xmath4 , are in reasonable agreement with the expectations given above .",
    "the average number of photoelectrons for normal incidence in the counters can be predicted from the cherenkov angle @xmath17 , and , near threshold @xmath18 , @xmath19    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the photoelectron spectra for @xmath20 , @xmath21 are observed to be poisson - like with tails from electromagnetic showers and delta rays produced as the particle traverses tof0 and the aerogel radiator .",
    "secondary electrons from these processes above about 1 mev/@xmath4 produce cherenkov light 56% of the time for each particle passage . for small-@xmath22 signals ,",
    "the measured spectra contain more zero - pe events than expected from pure poisson - like behavior @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "r0.5    npe",
    "the `` d1 '' and `` d2 '' dipoles in the mice beamline  @xcite predominantly control the beam momentum and particle types transmitted into the mice spectrometer . in the @xmath25 setting ( calibration mode ) , the beamline transports a mixture of decay / conversion electrons , decay muons , and primary pions . for @xmath26 ,",
    "backward muon decays from the decay solenoid ( ds ) are selected .",
    "g4beamline@xcite monte carlo runs indicate that a small leakage of primary pions through the d2 selection magnet can occur at the @xmath271% level  @xcite .",
    "both these high - momentum pions and their decay muons should be observable in both ckov - a and ckov - b .",
    "ckov - a can be used effectively to select the high - momentum @xmath28 events that are just over threshold  @xcite .",
    "unambiguous identification of particle species using the cherenkov detectors ( measuring velocity ) would require a momentum measurement from the mice tracker , which was not available in step i data .",
    "muons and pions are thus indistinguishable here by the cherenkov effect . in the following analysis",
    "we look for high - momentum @xmath21 or @xmath20 that trigger ckov - a .",
    "an additional cut on the number of photoelectrons in ckov - b serves to suppress the @xmath296% of slow  background \" events that pass the ckov - a cut due to delta - ray emission .",
    "we analyzed 120k step i muon events with @xmath30  mev/@xmath4 and @xmath31  mev/@xmath4 ( the  standard \" muon beam settings ) .",
    "we also analyzed 35k muon events with @xmath32  mev/@xmath4 and @xmath33  mev/@xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we cut away the electron signal ( by requiring tof  @xmath3426.4 ns ) and also make a ckov - a @xmath35 cut . the shoulder centered at 27.6 ns",
    "is made up of fast muons and pions triggering in @xmath36 and at tof1 .",
    "the background events centered approximately at tof=28 ns are from particles with momenta below threshold in ckov - a , but giving @xmath372 ckov - a light by delta - ray emission .",
    "this background is consistent with the expected 6@xmath38 contamination level .",
    "the tof=27.6  ns peak corresponds to @xmath39  mev/@xmath4 or @xmath40  mev/@xmath4 , both above threshold in ckov - a .",
    "fast muons and pions will leave considerable light in ckov - b . according to eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] about 10  pe will be produced in ckov - b at @xmath41  mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the probability for simultaneous delta - ray detection in _ both _ ckov - a _ and _ ckov - b will be about @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( right ) we add a ckov - b @xmath4310 cut .",
    "the delta - ray background is substantially reduced to about 500 events .",
    "a fit to gaussian signal and phase - space background of the form ( @xmath44 time of flight ) @xmath45 gives @xmath46 signal events .",
    "when corrected for efficiency  @xcite we obtain @xmath47 events . by varying the fitting parameters we find a @xmath48-event systematic ( syst ) uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the fast @xmath21-@xmath20 fraction is thus @xmath49\\%$ ] .",
    "if we assume pessimistically that all fast @xmath21-@xmath20 are pions , we can obtain upper limits on the pion fraction : @xmath50%  ( 90% cl ) and @xmath51  ( 95% cl ) .",
    "any bayesian model would require some prior knowledge of the pion - to - muon ratio in the beam .",
    "estimating this ( based on the g4beamline simulation ) to be about 1/20 ( or about 50 pions ) allows us to estimate the fraction of pions in the beam to be @xmath52 @xmath53indeed very small , surpassing the mice design requirements .",
