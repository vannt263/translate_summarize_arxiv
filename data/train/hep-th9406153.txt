    "as discussed before , the successive approximation for the saddle point equation is made by taking the higher order terms of the irreducible diagrams of the free energy .",
    "the first order approximation takes the following free energy , @xmath280    the saddle point equation becomes @xmath281    the derivative @xmath191 is related to @xmath40 as ( 2.12 ) , and we have in this order , @xmath282    in the large @xmath45 limit , we have @xmath283 and @xmath284    from ( 8.5 ) and ( 8.6 ) we pose these asymptotic behavior conditions on ( 8.1 ) as @xmath285    solving these coupled equations for the coefficients , we have @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 , and the differential equation is @xmath289    this equation is exact for the free energy of ( 8.3 ) , which corresponds to @xmath1-vector model ( 2.34 ) .    the next order @xmath290 is taken for the free energy as @xmath291    the saddle point equation determines the value of @xmath40 up to order @xmath290 , and consequently determines the value of @xmath41 as @xmath292    the large @xmath45 limit also determines the value of @xmath41 as @xmath293    thus we determine the values of @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 , assuming @xmath297 for @xmath298 , @xmath299    the solution of above equation gives @xmath286 , @xmath288 and @xmath300 , and it leads to @xmath301    which becomes an exact equation of all orders of @xmath45 . for the one matrix model , the renormalization group @xmath0-function ( 8.2 ) turns out to be simple .",
    "next we consider the gauge model in  5 . up to order @xmath290",
