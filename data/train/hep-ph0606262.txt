    "<S> this experiment , together with the atmospheric and the reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite , has confirmed the key idea by b. pontecorvo on neutrino oscillations  @xcite . the existence of non - zero neutrino mass and lepton mixing is thereby established . </S>",
    "<S> the sun appeared in this case as a natural laboratory for investigations of neutrino properties .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists a number of natural laboratories , the supernova explosions , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics . </S>",
    "<S> it means that microscopic neutrino characteristics , such as the neutrino magnetic moment , the neutrino dispersion in an active medium , etc . , would have a critical impact on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .    </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for a growing interest to neutrino physics in an external active medium . in an astrophysical environment </S>",
    "<S> , the main medium influence on neutrino properties is defined by the additional wolfenstein energy @xmath2 acquired by a left - handed neutrino  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general expression for this additional energy of a left - handed neutrino with the flavor @xmath3 is  @xcite @xmath4 ,   \\label{eq : enulgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath5 are the number densities of background electrons , protons , neutrons , and neutrinos , and @xmath6 are the densities of the corresponding antiparticles . to find the additional energy for antineutrinos , one should change the total sign in the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) .    for a typical astrophysical medium , except for the early universe and a supernova core </S>",
    "<S> , one has @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the barion density . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath10 as @xmath11 , the additional energy acquired by muon and tau left - handed neutrinos is always negative . at the same time , the additional energy of electron left - handed neutrinos becomes positive at @xmath12 . and </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , right - handed neutrinos and their antiparticles , left - handed antineutrinos , being sterile with respect to weak interactions , do not acquire an additional energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the additional energy @xmath2 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : enule ] ) gives an effective mass squared @xmath14 to the left - handed neutrino , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the neutrino four - momentum in medium , while @xmath17 would form the neutrino four - momentum in vacuum , @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> given a @xmath19 interaction , the additional energy of left - handed neutrinos in medium opens new kinematical possibilities for the radiative neutrino transition : @xmath20 it should be self - evident , that the influence of the substance on the photon dispersion must be taken into account , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the refractive index .    </S>",
    "<S> first , a possibility exists that the medium provides the condition @xmath23 ( the effective photon mass squared is negative , @xmath24 ) which corresponds to the well - known effect  @xcite of `` neutrino cherenkov radiation '' . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , the neutrino dispersion change under the medium influence is being usually neglected , because the neutrino dispersion is defined by the weak interaction while the photon dispersion is defined by the electromagnetic interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> pure theoretically , one more possibility could be considered when the photon dispersion was absent , and the process of the radiative neutrino transition @xmath25 would be caused by the neutrino dispersion only . as the left - handed neutrino dispersion is only changed , transitions become possible caused by the @xmath19 interaction with the neutrino chirality change , e.g. due to the neutrino magnetic dipole moment .    </S>",
    "<S> just this situation called the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath26 ) , was first proposed and investigated in detail in an extended series of papers  @xcite . however , in the analysis of this effect the authors overlooked such an important phenomenon as plasma influence on the photon dispersion . as will be shown below </S>",
    "<S> , this phenomenon closes the @xmath26 effect for all real astrophysical situations .    in this letter , we reanalyse the process @xmath27 taking into account both the neutrino dispersion and the photon dispersion in medium . having in mind possible astrophysical applications , it is worthwhile to consider the astrophysical plasma as a medium , which transforms the photon into the plasmon , see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the papers cited therein .    to perform a kinematical analysis , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to evaluate the scales of the values of the left - handed neutrino additional energy @xmath2 and of the photon ( plasmon ) effective mass squared @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> one readily obtains from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : enule ] ) : @xmath29 where the scale of the barion number density is taken , which is typical e.g. for the interior of a neutron star .    on the other hand , a plasmon acquires in medium an effective mass @xmath30 which is approximately constant at high energies . for the transversal plasmon , </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath28 is always positive , and is defined by the so - called plasmon frequency . in the non - relativistic classical plasma ( i.e. for the solar interior ) </S>",
    "<S> one has : @xmath31 for the ultra - relativistic dense matter one has : @xmath32 in the case of hot plasma , when its temperature is the largest physical parameter , the plasmon mass is : @xmath33 one more physical parameter , a great attention was payed to in the @xmath26 analysis  @xcite , was the neutrino vacuum mass @xmath34 . as the scale of neutrino vacuum mass could not exceed essentially a few electron - volts , which is much less than typical plasmon mass scales for real astrophysical situations , see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : omega_pl_nr])-([eq : omega_pl_h ] ) , it is reasonable to neglect @xmath34 in our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in accordance with  ( [ eq : ml ] ) , a simple condition for the kinematic opening of the process @xmath27 is : @xmath35 this means that the process becomes kinematically opened when the neutrino energy exceeds the threshold value , @xmath36 let us evaluate these threshold neutrino energies for different astrophysical situations .    for the solar interior @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the threshold neutrino energy is @xmath39 to be compared with the upper bound @xmath40 20 mev for the solar neutrino energies .    for the interior of a neutron star , where @xmath41 , the wolfenstein energy for neutrinos  ( [ eq : enule ] ) , ( [ eq : enulmu ] ) is negative , and the process </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 is closed . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a possibility for opening the antineutrino decay . taking for the estimation @xmath42 , one obtains from  ( [ eq : w ] ) and  ( [ eq : omega_pl_r ] ) the threshold value @xmath43 to be compared with the typical energy @xmath40 mev of neutrinos emitted via the urca processes .    for the conditions of a supernova core </S>",
    "<S> , the additional energy of left - handed electron neutrinos can be obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 describes the fraction of trapped electron neutrinos in the core , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> taking typical parameters of a supernova core , we obtain @xmath47 to be compared with the averaged energy @xmath48 mev of trapped neutrinos .    in the early universe , when plasma was almost charge symmetric , the wolfenstein formula  ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) giving zero </S>",
    "<S> should be changed to a more accurate expression for the additional energy which is identical for both neutrinos and antineutrinos  @xcite @xmath49 the minus sign unambiguously shows that in the early universe , in contrast to the neutron star interior , the decay process is forbidden both for neutrinos and antineutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the above analysis shows that the nice effect of the `` neutrino spin light '' , unfortunately , has no place in real astrophysical situations because of the photon dispersion . the sole possibility for the discussed process @xmath27 to have any significance could be connected only with the situation when an ultra - high energy neutrino threads a star . </S>",

    "<S> it should be stressed that discussing ultra - high energy neutrinos , and consequently the high plasmon energies , one can consider with a good accuracy the plasmon mass @xmath30 as a constant depending on the plasma properties only , see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : omega_pl_nr])-([eq : omega_pl_h ] ) . </S>",
