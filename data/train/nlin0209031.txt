    "relaxation to thermal equilibrium has been studied in hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic phenomena in the relaxation process is anomalous diffusion , since normal diffusion is expected at equilibrium .",
    "anomalous diffusion was firstly investigated in a one - dimensional chaotic map to describe enhanced diffusion in josephson junctions @xcite , and is observed in many systems both numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion is also observed in hamiltonian dynamical systems .",
    "it is explained as due to power - type distribution functions @xcite of trapping and untrapping times of the orbit in the self - similar hierarchy of cylindrical cantori @xcite .",
    "self - similarity is expected to be one of the important concepts to understand statistics and motion in hamiltonian systems , but can not be the main feature in systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "then , as the first step of approaching the study of self - similarity , we have to clarify when anomalous diffusion appears , and what is the origin of the anomaly .",
    "latora et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the relation between the process of relaxation to equilibrium and anomalous diffusion in a globally coupled rotator system , by comparing the time series of the temperature and of the mean squared displacement of the phases of the rotators .",
    "they showed that anomalous diffusion changes to a normal diffusion after a crossover time , and that the crossover time coincides with the time when the canonical temperature is reached .",
    "they also claim that anomalous diffusion occurs in the quasi - stationary states , which appear before the system goes towards equilibrium .",
    "the crossover from anomalous to normal diffusion determines the time when the anomalous diffusion finishes .",
    "however , it is not clearly pointed out when the anomalous diffusion starts , and hence the study of the relation between the relaxation process and anomalous diffusion is still not complete . moreover , in ref.@xcite , the numerical calculations were performed by using only one type of initial condition , but different types of initial condition may change the conclusion @xcite .    in this article , we study the globally coupled rotator system considered in ref.@xcite , and we exhibit the relation between relaxation to equilibrium and anomalous diffusion with a different type of initial condition from one used in ref.@xcite . then we show that diffusion becomes anomalous if and only if the state is neither stationary nor quasi - stationary . in other words , diffusion is shown to be normal in quasi - stationary states , although a stretched exponential correlation function is present , contrary to previous claims that report power law type function @xcite",
    ". simple scaling laws of the correlation function imply that the result holds irrespective of degrees of freedom .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model , initial condition and observed quantities are described in sec.[sec : model ] . in sec.[sec : relaxation - process ] , we study relaxation process , which we divide into three stages , quasi - stationary , relaxational and equilibrium stages .",
    "diffusion process in each stage is investigated in sec.[sec : diffusion - process ] by using stretched exponential correlation functions of momenta .",
    "dependence on degrees of freedom is also reported both in secs.[sec : relaxation - process ] and [ sec : diffusion - process ] .",
    "the last section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary .",

    "we remark that the potential @xmath4 and the kinetic energy @xmath5 are related to the magnetization @xmath6 as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy per particle , i.e. @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the total energy .",
    "the free energy of this system has been obtained in the canonical ensemble @xcite , and it has been shown that system ( [ eq : model ] ) has a second - order phase transition at the critical energy @xmath11 .",
    "if the energy @xmath8 is greater than the critical energy , the largest lyapunov exponent goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "then , all rotators freely rotate , and diffusion becomes ballistic . on the contrary , if @xmath8 is small compared to @xmath13 , all rotators are trapped in the potential well and no diffusion occurs .",
    "we are therefore interested in a value of the energy which is near but less than the critical energy in order to allow some particle diffusion .",
