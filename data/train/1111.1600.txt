    "<S> we determine the strangeness and light quark fractions of the nucleon mass by computing the quark line connected and disconnected contributions to the matrix elements @xmath0 in lattice qcd , using the non - perturbatively improved sheikholeslami - wohlert wilson fermionic action . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate @xmath1 mass degenerate sea quarks with a pion mass of about 285  mev and a lattice spacing @xmath2  fm . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of the matrix elements involves mixing between contributions from different quark flavours . </S>",
    "<S> the pion - nucleon @xmath3-term is extrapolated to physical quark masses exploiting the sea quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the renormalized values @xmath4 mev at the physical point and @xmath5 for the strangeness contribution at our larger than physical sea quark mass . </S>"
