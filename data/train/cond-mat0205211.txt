    "the purely geometric percolation phenomenon @xcite has astonishing analogies with ordinary second - order thermal phase transitions : the percolation variables show power - law behaviour near criticality , with relative exponents ; the exponents are not all independent , but related to each other by scaling equalities which are formally identical to the corresponding thermal ones ; the critical indices do not depend on the specific features of a system but they are grouped in universality classes , which in the percolation case are uniquely specified by the number of space dimensions of the system .",
    "these analogies suggested many years ago that a continuous thermal transition might be nothing but a percolation transition @xcite , provided one defines suitable clusters , or _",
    "droplets_. the growth of the droplets describes naturally the propagation of correlations between different particles of the system and the formation of an infinite spanning structure represents the long - range order of the system in the new phase .    in this paper",
    "we focus on spin models with a continuous magnetization transition . in order to map the critical behaviour of a system onto a percolation picture",
    ", one must set a correspondence between thermal and geometric variables .",
    "the main percolation variables are :    * the percolation strength @xmath7 , i.e. the probability that a site chosen at random belongs to a percolating cluster ; * the average cluster size @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of clusters with @xmath11 sites and the sums exclude eventual percolating clusters .",
    "the conditions for a successful mapping are listed below :    * the percolation point must coincide with the thermal critical point ; * the connectedness length ( average cluster radius ) diverges as the thermal correlation length ( same exponent ) ; * the percolation strength @xmath7 near the threshold varies like the order parameter @xmath12 of the model ( same exponent ) ; * the average cluster size @xmath8 diverges as the physical susceptibility @xmath13 ( same exponent ) .",
    "it is not yet known whether , given a system , there are at all clusters satisfying such conditions , which are quite strict .",
    "the first studies concentrated on the simplest theory , the ising model without field . a real breakthrough in these investigations was the discovery that the ising model can be rewritten as a geometrical model @xcite , where the fundamental objects are special site - bond clusters , i.e. clusters built by joining nearest - neighbouring spins of the same sign with a temperature - dependent bond probability @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the ising spin - spin coupling ) .",
    "it is possible to prove that these site - bond clusters are just the critical droplets of the system . starting from this result , which is valid more in general for the @xmath16-state potts model",
    ", it is possible to define the droplets for a wide variety of systems , like models with several spin - spin couplings , as long as they are all ferromagnetic @xcite , and @xmath17 spin models @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all these results is the fact that a geometrical bond ( with a bond probability ) is associated with each spin - spin coupling in the percolation picture . in this way , for models with several ( ferromagnetic ) interactions , the clusters are quite weird objects , consisting of geometrically disconnected parts which are joined to each other by virtue of invisible bridges due to long - ranged interactions . besides , if not all couplings are ferromagnetic , it is not yet clear if and how one can define the droplets .",
    "very recent results show that the simple connections between nearest - neighbour spins have a close relationship with the phase transition of several bidimensional models @xcite : the percolation point of the pure - site clusters coincides with the critical point and the percolation exponents , which differ from the thermal exponents , are the same for models in the same universality class . in our opinion",
    "this property indicates that , in many cases , the simple geometrical connectivity between nearest - neighbours plays a crucial role in the mechanism of the phase transition .    in the 2d ising model",
    ", the fact that both the pure - site and the site - bond clusters with bond probability @xmath18 start to percolate at the critical temperature @xmath0 necessarily implies that , by taking a bond probability @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , the percolation temperature of the site - bond clusters with bond weight @xmath19 is always @xmath0 .",
    "a renormalization group analysis @xcite led to the conclusion that the percolation exponents are the same as for the pure - site clusters for any @xmath21 , and that they suddenly switch to the thermal exponents for @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 , the site - bond clusters percolate at some temperature @xmath24 and the exponents switch to the 2d random percolation universality class .",
    "this analysis , though reliable , is however not rigorous . in this paper",
    "we will show that the result is true and valid for many bidimensional models .",
    "we will see that , given a model , there is a critical probability @xmath3 such that , by taking a bond weight @xmath25 ( including the pure - site case @xmath26 ) the site - bond clusters keep percolating at @xmath0 and the critical percolation exponents are the same ; for @xmath6 the exponents change abruptly to the thermal exponents . the probability @xmath3 , which is model - dependent , is the minimal probability which still allows the formation of a percolating cluster at @xmath0 , and this gives us a general prescription for the critical droplets .",
    "our investigations consisted of monte carlo simulations on square lattices of several models around the critical temperature .",
    "we took the same models that were studied in @xcite , i.e.    1 .   the ising model , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) ; 2 .   a model with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) ferromagnetic coupling and a weaker next - to - nearest ( ntn )",
    "antiferromagnetic coupling : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath29 ) ; 3 .   the continuous ising model , @xmath34 ( @xmath28 , @xmath35 ) ; 4 .",
    "su(2 ) pure gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions ; 5 .   the 3-state potts model , @xmath36 ( @xmath28 , @xmath37 ) ; 6 .   a model obtained by adding to 5 ) a weaker next - to - nearest ( ntn ) antiferromagnetic coupling : @xmath38 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath37 ) ;    the critical temperatures of all these systems are known with good precision ( see @xcite ) , for models 1 and 5 the values are analytically known .",
    "we stress that the models belong to the 2d @xmath39 ( 1 - 4 ) and @xmath40 ( 5,6 ) universality classes .",
    "the estimates of @xcite for the main critical indices of the percolation transition of the pure - site clusters for the two classes are in very good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite-@xcite ; we list these analytical values in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".[tab1 ] critical percolation indices for pure - site clusters for the two universality classes we considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we found a general criterion to identify the critical droplets of various bidimensional systems .",
    "the droplets are the clusters obtained by joining nearest - neighbour spins of the same sign ( -state for potts - like systems ) with the minimal bond probability @xmath3 that still allows the clusters to percolate at the critical point of the thermal transition . for any @xmath25",
    "the onset of percolation for the relative site - bond clusters keeps coinciding with the thermal threshold and the critical indices are the same up to the pure - site case @xmath26 . we stress that this prescription seems to work also for the cases in which one can rigorously define the droplets . for the continuous ising model , for instance ,",
    "the droplets are defined by introducing local bond weights which also depend on the length of the spins and not only on their sign @xcite .",
    "these clusters certainly differ in detail from the droplets defined in this paper ; nevertheless their behaviour at criticality is identical . the matter would be even more involved for models with several ferromagnetic interactions , for which a rigorous definition of droplets requires the presence of longer - range connections than just between nearest - neighbour spins @xcite .",
    "the fact that the critical behaviour of the system is reproduced by simple site - bond clusters , no matter how complicated the model is , suggests that the long - range fluctuations of the system , which are responsible for the phase transition , are embodied in the simple magnetic domains of the system ; the bond probability @xmath3 is necessary in order to destroy additional spin correlations due to purely geometrical effects , as already remarked in @xcite . besides",
    ", we have seen that the result is also valid in cases where a rigorous definition of droplets is , at present , missing ( models 2 , 4 and 6 ) . in particular , it remains true for @xmath41 pure gauge theory , which is a very complicated model involving many different interactions , like multispin couplings , long - ranged couplings ( ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ) and self - interactions .",
    "this shows that the result has some generality , and it would be interesting to check to which extent it is true for bidimensional models with a continuous magnetization transition",
    ". it would be also interesting to check whether simple site - bond clusters play a role in the description of critical behaviour at higher dimensions as well .",
