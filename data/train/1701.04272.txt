    "optical light curves and spectra of gravitationally lensed quasars show different phases of microlensing activity induced by stars in lensing galaxies , and each of these phases is relevant for certain astrophysical studies .",
    "periods of high microlensing activity were reported for several systems , including prominent flux variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , significant spectral distortions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or both ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such high activity is related to stellar mass microlenses strongly affecting the accretion disk and the innermost part of the broad line region ( blr ) , while the narrow line region ( nlr ) remains unaffected .",
    "hence , a strong microlensing episode in a lensed quasar can be used to probe the structure of its accretion disk and blr , as well as the composition of the main lensing galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . unfortunately , when an important extrinsic ( microlensing ) variability is present in the light curve of an image of a lensed quasar , it is difficult to accurately measure the time delay between that image and any other . only in some cases ,",
    "time delays were measured to @xmath5 5% precision after monitoring during 5@xmath610 year periods and using sophisticated techniques of analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time delays can be used to constrain the hubble constant ( and other cosmological parameters ) and lensing mass distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , lensed quasars with two or more images in quiescent phases of microlensing activity are ideal targets to determine delays and study the universe on different scales .",
    "knowing the time delay between two quiescent images of the same quasar , if we detect a sharp variation in the optical flux of the leading image , a multiwavelength campaign can be planned to follow the variability of the trailing one .",
    "multiwavelength intrinsic variations in this trailing image are valuable tools to carry out reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus check the quasar structure derived from active microlensing periods .",
    "time delays from quiescent images and images showing smooth microlensing variations are often measured to @xmath7 3% precision , and sometimes to precision levels as low as a few tenths of a percent .",
    "the lensed quasar consists of two optically bright images ( a and b ) separated by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although inada et al . reported a source redshift @xmath1 = 2.054 , this relies on the sdss spectrum of the a image taken in 2007 , which has all its emission features at @xmath9 = 2.049 .",
    "it is also worth to note that the sdss / boss spectrum of a in 2012 , as well as the new spectra of a and b in 2015 ( see section [ subsubsec : gtcspec ] ) , contain emission lines at a redshift of 2.049 .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath1 = @xmath9 = 2.049 throughout this paper .",
    "inada et al .",
    "also presented spectra of a and b that were obtained through a 900 s exposure with the dolores spectrograph on the 3.6 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) .",
    "they found strong mgii absorption at @xmath54900   in the spectrum of b ( the image closer to the main lensing galaxy g1 ) .",
    "such an absorption feature corresponds to intervening gas at a redshift of 0.742 , suggesting that @xmath4 = 0.742 .",
    "new subaru telescope adaptive ",
    "optics observations in the @xmath10band improved the relative astrometry of the lens system and the morphological parameters of g1 @xcite .",
    "rusu et al . also detected a secondary galaxy g2 southwest of the abg1 system and predicted the time delay @xmath11 for three different lens models . to perform this model fitting , the macrolens magnification ratio @xmath12 was constrained within an interval based on the @xmath10band magnitude difference @xmath13 .",
    "the expected value of @xmath11 ranged from @xmath5 145 to @xmath5 216 days , with the longest delay for the most realistic model : singular isothermal ellipsoid plus external shear ( sie+@xmath14 ) .",
    "here we focus on observations of during a quiescent phase of microlensing activity over the 2014@xmath62016 period .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : section [ sec : data ] presents a 2.6year photometric monitoring of both quasar images , and spectroscopic follow  up observations of the lens system .",
    "these last observations include new long  slit spectra that are 50 times deeper than the previous ones with the tng ( see above ) .",
    "section [ sec : delay ] is devoted to accurately measure @xmath11 , while we estimate @xmath12 in section [ sec : extmagmic ] . in section [ sec : extmagmic ] , we also discuss the dust extinction and microlensing magnification in g1 . in section [ sec : lensmod ] , we update the sie+@xmath14 lens model , confirm the tentative redshift of g1 , and discuss the role of g2 ( and other intervening object ) in the lensing phenomenon .",
    "our main results and conclusions appear in section [ sec : end ] .",
    "we conducted a photometric monitoring campaign of from early february of 2014 to mid september of 2016 , i.e. , for 2.6 years with an average sampling rate of about two nights every week .",
    "all optical observations were performed with the 2.0 m fully robotic liverpool telescope ( lt ) at the roque de los muchachos observatory , canary islands ( spain ) , using the io : o ccd camera ( pixel scale of @xmath15 ) .",
    "each observing night , 2 @xmath16 300 s exposures were taken in the @xmath0 sloan passband , and the corresponding frames were subsequently passed through a pre  processing pipeline .",
    "the lt data reduction pipeline included bias subtraction , overscan trimming , and flat fielding .",
    "in addition , we cleaned cosmic rays and interpolated over bad pixels using the bad pixel mask .",
    "after the basic reduction of frames , we assumed that the point ",
    "spread function ( psf ) for each exposure is defined by the surface brightness distribution of the unsaturated star with @xmath0 = 16.770 mag in the vicinity of the lens system ( see the left panel of figure [ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "we also adopted this psf star as the reference object for differential photometry .",
    "the relative fluxes and magnitudes of both quasar images were then derived through psf fitting . our crowded ",
    "field photometry pipeline relied on iraf tasks and the imfitfits software @xcite , while the photometric model consisted of two psfs ( a and b ) , an exponential profile convolved with the psf ( g1 galaxy located between a and b ) , and a constant background .",
    "@xcite reported that the srsic index of g1 is consistent with @xmath17 = 1 ( exponential profile ) , instead of @xmath17 = 4 ( de vaucouleurs profile ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that g1 is an edge  on disk  like galaxy .",
    "the ellipticity , orientation , and effective radius of g1 , as well as the relative positions of b and g1 ( with respect to a ) , were taken from @xcite .",
    "the galaxy brightness was estimated from the best frames in terms of signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) and full  width at half  maximum ( fwhm ) of the seeing disc .",
    "these frames led to a galaxy  to  psf star ratio @xmath18 = 0.005 , or equivalently , @xmath0(g1 ) = 22.5 mag .",
    "we then applied our pipeline to the 310 usable frames , incorporating this @xmath18 value as an additional constraint .",
    "as g1 is very faint in the @xmath0 band , and the magnitude difference between g1 and the faintest quasar image is @xmath54 ( @xmath19 40 ) , we note that the adopted galaxy model does not play a critical role in extracting quasar fluxes .",
    "we identified 19 frames producing outliers in the quasar light curves , so these were removed from the final database .",
    "the remaining 291 frames ( average fwhm of @xmath20 ) allowed us to obtain @xmath0sdss magnitudes of a and b at 150 nights ( epochs ) .",
    "we also calculated the magnitudes of a field star at these epochs .",
