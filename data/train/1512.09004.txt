    "there have been recent experimental reports regarding the observation that there is direct evidence of the role played by screening of charged impurities in graphene and the two - dimensional electron liquid on their properties @xcite .",

    "the presence of impurities may produce potential fluctuations whose amplitude can depend on both the density of ions , their location , magnetic field and temperature which can affect their high mobility .",

    "we intend to examine the behavior of the static polarizability and shielded potential in the strong field limit for monolayer graphene and the 2del by carrying out detailed numerical calculations . to bolster confidence in our numerical procedure",

    "we also report results for the screening of an impurity embedded within or near a 2del and a graphene layer .",

    "is increased , these peaks become smeared out and the polarizability is diminished .",
    "correspondingly , the screened potential exhibits exactly the same number of local maxima as its polarization at @xmath63 k responsible for dielectric screening . just like the polarizability , there is smearing of these peaks when the temperature is increased @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath105 at @xmath63 k in terms of the electron density @xmath106 .",

    "irrespective of what temperature chosen , the first peak in the static polarizability function appears at @xmath108 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we have presented results for the polarization function and its derivative for a 2del for several filling factors ( @xmath109 ) at @xmath63 k. additionally , in fig",

    "these results should be compared with those in ref .",
    "@xcite which show that the part of the curve for the derivative of the polarizability which connects the first local maximum with the first local minimum is a manifestation of the smoothing of the fermi surface by temperature .    in the absence of any magnetic field",
    ", we may obtain the polarizability at @xmath63 k by making use of the analytical formula of stern @xcite . in this case",
    ", the derivative function has a discontinuity at @xmath111 , i.e. , twice the fermi wave vector .",
    "in fact , between @xmath112 , the polarizability is constant and for @xmath113 , it falls off like @xmath114 .",
    "although the polarizability function itself is continuous at @xmath111 , the abrupt change in slope is what gives the discontinuity in its derivative .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] show that when we introduce temperature , there is an effect on the polarization function and subsequently on the screened potential . in accordance with our results",
    "above , we obtain a finite number of oscillatory peaks for a finite magnetic field which is increased as the magnetic field is reduced .",
    "therefore , we have , as expected , the friedel oscillations at @xmath115 in fig .  [ fig:4 ] and",
    "whose amplitudes decrease with temperature .    at this point , we note that when we introduce magnetic field into the calculations , some distinct features arise .",
    "first , each of the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] through [ fig:3 ] for @xmath116 for the 2del is dependent on wavevector in the long wavelength limit .",
    "however the polarization is constant over a wide range ( @xmath117 ) in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the length scales in our plots for zero and finite magnetic field are related through the equation @xmath118 . in the shorter wavelengths",
    "limit , the @xmath114 dependence now has oscillations , which is due to the presence of laguerre polynomials in the form factor .",
    "our conclusion from these calculations is that the number of peaks in the polarization function and its derivative is equal to the filling factor @xmath65 for the number of filled landau levels .",
    "this is also the same as the number of local maxima in the screened potential in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "turning now to the effect of temperature and magnetic field on _ doped _ monolayer graphene , we present plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for the static polarizability and the screened potential at various temperatures in the absence of an external magnetic field . in our numerical simulations",
    ", we employ an appropriate value for the wigner - seitz radius defined as the ratio of the potential to the kinetic energy in an interacting coulomb system @xcite . for comparison and explanation of the characteristic features",
    "we have obtained , we refer to the results previously obtained for the static polarization when @xmath63 k and @xmath115 @xcite and for finite temperature in the absence of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the effect due to temperature between @xmath119 is just as significant for doped graphene as for 2del since the constant polarization function in this range is independent on @xmath120 at @xmath63 k but is definitely wave vector dependent when the sample is heated .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for the screened potential show that there may be friedel oscillations which become smeared with temperature and also when the charged impurity is moved away from the 2d layer of graphene .",
    "however , the major difference between the friedel oscillations for the 2del and monolayer graphene is that in the former case , there are plus - to - minus oscillations as the distance from the impurity is increased .",
    "however , for monolayer graphene , the screened potential is always repulsive .",
    "this , of course , may directly be attributed to the difference in band structure for the two media and will indicate the difference in the many - body effects due to dielectric shielding .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows our results for the static polarization function for monolayer graphene at @xmath63 k when there is a magnetic field present .",
    "we present results corresponding to the cases when there are @xmath121 landau levels filled .",
    "for clarity , we separated the contributions to the polarizability corresponding to intra - band and inter - band transitions .",
    "the intra - band static polarization function has the same number of peaks as the total number of occupied landau levels , as is the case for the 2del where only conducting electrons are considered for transitions from below to above the fermi level . for the inter - band polarization function , there is no restriction on the number of allowed transitions .",
    "consequently , this is devoid of the  signature \" peaks as its intra - band counterpart possesses .",
    "adding these two parts leads us to our presented results which agree with those given by roldan , et al .",
    "we emphasize that the dirac cone approximation ( in zero magnetic field ) is valid only for a limited range range of energy ( 0@xmath122300 mev ) , thereby requiring that in carrying out our calculations , we must introduce a cut - off value @xmath123 for the number of landau levels in the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "specifically , in fig .  6 , we chose the cut - off value @xmath124 .",
    "our results above show that for 2del , there are @xmath65 peaks in the polarization function as well as @xmath65 peaks for the screened potential for chosen magnetic field . for graphene , there are also @xmath65 peaks in the polarization function , coming from the @xmath65 filled landau levels , as we noted above . however , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , there are @xmath65 peaks in the screened potential which are clearly visible but these are very sensitive to whether or not the impurity is embedded within the 2d layer .",
    "when we set the impurity at a finite distance from the graphene layer , the peaks in the screened potential are smeared out .",
    "the sensitive nature of these results establishes a dramatic difference between mlg and the 2del .",
    "the results here not only provide additional insight into the behavior of the static polarization function in strong magnetic fields over a range of temperature , but they demonstrate the many - body effects on the screening properties under these varying environmental conditions . although the emphasis has been on integer filling of the landau levels , we may extend our calculations to the case when there is fractional filling .",
    "our calculations show that substantial differences occur between the 2del and monolayer graphene in the @xmath125 limit where the filling factor response functions have different functional dependences on the wave vector due to the absence of low - energy excitations when @xmath126 , contrary to the contribution from the energy bands to the lindhard function in the absence of magnetic field . from a mathematical point of view , this difference is due to the sum over @xmath127-sum being dominated by the @xmath128 term in eq .",
    "( [ ref:5 ] ) , i.e. , by the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied landau level .",
    "figures [ fig:1 ] through [ fig:3 ] show oscillations for finite filling factor , for intermediate wave vector . however",
    ", these oscillations in @xmath129 subside with increasing @xmath65 in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , and the screened potential exhibits the friedel - like oscillations as a function of displacement .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained for monolayer graphene , as we have shown .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive description of the combined effect of temperature and magnetic field on the static polarization function for mlg associated with the dirac point . for completeness",
    ", we calculated numerically the polarizability for the 2del under a uniform perpendicular magnetic field at finite temperature .",
    "our results for the 2del are concerned with the effect due to a strong magnetic field on the polarizability and screening in monolayer graphene and the 2del .",
    "this is in contrast with ref .   where the weak field limit was emphasized .",
    "the results we obtained are given in an experimentally achievable long wavelength regime .",
    "besides , the numerical results were obtained at low temperature where the sharpness of the fermi surface is evident and at high enough temperature which brought to bear the effect which heating may have on this property of the electron liquid .    among our main conclusions which arise from our calculations in this paper ,",
    "we have obtained the following . for doped mlg ,",
    "the most important effect occurs in the limit @xmath130 for any filling factor @xmath65 and any temperature , as well as at larger wave vectors ( beyond @xmath131 ) when the temperature is high . at @xmath63",
    "k , it is clear from a mathematical point of view that the polarizability is dominated by transitions from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied landau level . as the temperature",
    "is increased , other transitions contribute thereby leading to a smearing of the low - temperature structure .",
