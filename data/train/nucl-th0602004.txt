    "the observation of @xmath1 decay would immediately tell us that neutrinos are massive majorana particles ( for reviews see  @xcite ; the issues particularly relevant for the program of @xmath1 decay search are discussed in @xcite ) . but without accurate calculations of the nuclear matrix elements quantitative conclusions about the absolute neutrino masses and mass hierarchies can barely be reached . despite years of effort there is at present a lack of consensus among nuclear theorists how to correctly calculate the nuclear matrix elements , and how to estimate their uncertainty ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since an overwhelming majority of published calculations is based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its modifications , it is worthwhile to try to see what causes the sizable spread of the calculated @xmath0 values .",
    "does it reflect some fundamental uncertainty , or is it mostly related to different choices of various adjustable parameters ? if the latter is true ( and we believe it is ) can one find and justify an optimal choice that largely removes such unphysical dependence ?    in our recent papers",
    "@xcite we have shown that by adjusting the most important parameter , the strength of the particle - particle force so that the known rate of the @xmath2-decay is correctly reproduced , the dependence of the calculated @xmath1 nuclear matrix elements @xmath0 on the things which are not _ a priori _ fixed , in particular , the number of included single particle states , the different realistic representations of the nucleon @xmath3-matrix , the axial vector quenching factor etc .",
    ", is essentially removed .",
    "the method has systematically been applied to calculate the nuclear matrix elements @xmath0 for most of the nuclei with known experimental @xmath2-decay rates and arguments in favor of the chosen calculation method have been given .    in this contribution to the medex05 we briefly review the ideas and the results of  @xcite .",
    "provided that a virtual light majorana neutrino with the effective mass @xmath4 , @xmath5 is exchanged between the nucleons the half - life of the @xmath1 decay is given by @xmath6 is an accurately calculable phase - space factor , and @xmath7 is the corresponding nuclear matrix element .",
    "thus , obviously , any uncertainty in @xmath7 makes the value of @xmath4 equally uncertain .",
    "the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath8 and the mass - squared differences @xmath9 can be determined in oscillation experiments . if the existence of the @xmath1 decay is proved and the value of @xmath10 is found , combining the knowledge of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a relatively narrow range of absolute neutrino mass scale can be determined , in most situations independently of the majorana phases @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matrix element @xmath7 is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the wave functions of the ground states of the initial ( final ) nuclei .",
    "the explicit forms of the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given in ref .",
    "we note that for @xmath16 nuclear matrix element @xmath7 coincides with @xmath17 of our previous work @xcite .",
    "this parameterization is chosen so that we could later modify the value of @xmath18 and still use the same phase space factor @xmath19 that contains @xmath20 , tabulated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in  @xcite the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its modification , the renormalized qrpa ( rqrpa ) , are used to describe the structure of the intermediate nuclear states virtually excited in the double beta decay .",
    "we stress that in the qrpa and rqrpa one can include essentially unlimited set of single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "states , but only a limited subset of configurations ( iterations of the particle - hole , respectively two - quasiparticle configurations ) , in contrast to the nuclear shell model . on the other hand , within the qrpa",
    "it is not obvious how many single particle states one should include .",
    "hence , various authors choose this crucial number basically for reasons of convenience .",
    "it is well known that the residual interaction is an effective interaction depending on the size of the s.p .",
    "hence , when the basis is changed , the interaction should be modified as well . for each nucleus in question three",
    "single - particle bases are chosen in refs .",
    "@xcite with the smallest set corresponding to @xmath21 particle - hole excitations , and the largest to about @xmath22 excitations .",
    "energies are calculated with the coulomb corrected woods - saxon potential .",
    "the in ref .",
    "@xcite calculations have been performed using @xmath3-matrix based only on the bonn - cd nucleon - nucleon potential because as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite a particular choice of the realistic residual two - body interaction potential has almost no impact on the finally calculated mean value and variance @xmath23 of @xmath7 , with the overwhelming contribution to @xmath23 coming from the choice of the single - particle basis size .    in qrpa and rqrpa",
    "there are three important global parameters renormalizing the bare residual interaction .",
    "first , the pairing part of the interaction is multiplied by a factor @xmath24 whose magnitude is adjusted , for both protons and neutrons separately , such that the pairing gaps for the initial and final nuclei are correctly reproduced .",
    "this is a standard procedure and it is well - known that within the bcs method the strength of the pairing interaction depends on the size of the s.p .",
    "second , the particle - hole interaction block is renormalized by an overall strength parameter @xmath25 which is typically adjusted by requiring that the energy of the giant gt resonance is correctly reproduced .",
    "we find that the calculated energy of the giant gt state is almost independent of the size of the s.p .",
    "basis and is well reproduced with @xmath26 .",
    "accordingly , we use @xmath27 throughout , without adjustment .",
    "third , an very important strength parameter @xmath28 renormalizes the particle - particle interaction ( the importance of the particle - particle interaction for the @xmath29 decay was recognized first in @xcite ) .",
    "the decay rate for both modes of @xmath29 decay is well known to depend sensitively on the value of @xmath28 ( in @xmath30 channel the sensitivity originates as a pronounced effect of variation of the degree of the su(4)-symmetry violation by the particle - particle interaction  @xcite ) .",
    "this property has been used in  @xcite to fix the value of @xmath28 for each of the s.p .",
    "bases so that the known half - lives of the @xmath31 decay are correctly reproduced .",
    "such an adjustment of @xmath28 , when applied to all multipoles @xmath32 , has been shown in  @xcite to remove much of the sensitivity to the number of s.p .",
    "states , to the @xmath33 potential employed , and even to whether rqrpa or just simple qrpa methods are used .",
    "this is in contrast to typical conclusion made in the recent past ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that the values of @xmath7 vary substantially depending on all of these things .",
    "we believe that the @xmath34 decay rate is especially suitable for such an adjustment , in particular because it involves the same initial and final states as the @xmath35 decay . moreover , the qrpa is a method designed to describe collective states as well as to obey various sum rules .",
    "both double - beta decay amplitudes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , receive contributions from many intermediate states and using one of them for fixing parameters of qrpa seems preferable .",
    "it is well known that the calculated gamow - teller strength is larger than the experimental one .",
    "formally , this quenching could be conveniently accomplished by replacing the true value of the axial current coupling constant @xmath18 = 1.25 by a quenched value @xmath36 1.0 . to see the dependence on the chosen @xmath18 value , both values of @xmath18",
    "have been used ( for all multipoles ) .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath7 calculated for the three s.p",
    ". bases and a fixed @xmath18 are relatively close to each other .    for each nucleus the corresponding average @xmath37 matrix elements ( averaged over the three choices of the s.p .",
    "space ) is evaluated , as well as its variance @xmath23 .",
    "the errors induced in @xmath37 by the experimental uncertainties in @xmath38 are added to the theoretical ones .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 matrix elements are presented in fig .",
    "[ 0nbbfig:2 ] . there",
    "the averaged nuclear matrix elements for both methods and both choices of @xmath18 are shown along with their full uncertainties ( theoretical plus experimental ) .",
    "one can see that not only is the variance substantially less than the average value , but the results of qrpa are quite close to the rqrpa values .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the matrix elements calculated with different @xmath18 is closer to unity ( in most cases they differ only by @xmath3920% ) than the ratio of the respective @xmath18 squared ( 1.6 in our case ) .",
    "again , such a partial compensation of the @xmath18-dependence has its origin in the adopted way of fixing @xmath28 to reproduce @xmath38 because one needs smaller @xmath28 for smaller @xmath18 .",
    "one can qualitatively understand why our chosen procedure stabilizes the @xmath7 matrix elements as follows : @xmath40 matrix elements involve only the @xmath41 states in the intermediate odd - odd nucleus .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath41 multipole for both modes of the @xmath29 decay depend very sensitively on @xmath28 due to a proximity to the point of the phase - transition in the @xmath41 channel ( corresponding to the collapse of the qrpa equations of motion ) . on the other hand , virtual excitations of many states of different multipolarities in the intermediate odd - odd nucleus contribute to the @xmath7 matrix element , due to the presence of the neutrino propagator .",
    "the multipoles , other than @xmath41 , correspond to small amplitudes of the collective motion ; there is no instability for realistic values of @xmath42 .",
    "hence , they are much less sensitive to the value of @xmath28 . by making sure that the contribution of the @xmath41 multipole is fixed , we therefore stabilize the @xmath7 value .",
    "the fact that rqrpa essentially removes the instability becomes then almost irrelevant thanks to the chosen adjustment of @xmath28 .",
    "one can see in fig . 2 of @xcite that all multipoles @xmath32 , with the exception of the @xmath41 and various very small entries ,",
    "contribute with the same sign and show the essential stability of the partial contributions against variation of the basis size .",
    "this suggests that uncertainties in one or few of them will have relatively minor effect .",
    "it is instructive to see separately the effect of the sometimes neglected short - range repulsive nucleon - nucleon repulsion and of the induced weak nucleon currents .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "6 of  @xcite that the conclusion of the relative role of different multipoles is affected by these terms . for example",
    ", in @xmath43mo the @xmath44 multipole is the strongest one when all effects are included , while the @xmath45 becomes dominant when they are neglected .",
    "ideally , the chosen nuclear structure method should describe all , or at least very many , experimental data and do that without adjustments . that is not the case of the qrpa or the rqrpa .",
    "the interaction used is an effective interaction , and various parameters are adjusted .",
    "one of our goals in  @xcite was to show that a majority of differences among various qrpa - like calculations can be understood and possible convergence of the qrpa results can be discussed .    a detailed list of 13 main reasons leading to a spread of the published qrpa and rqrpa results is given in  @xcite .",
    "some nuclei , like @xmath43mo , exhibit more sensitivity to these effects than others , such as @xmath46ge or @xmath47se .",
    "that is confirmed by our numerical studies .",
    "the two very important reasons are : + 1 ) the choice of @xmath28 ( usually fixed to reproduce the experimental half - lives either of @xmath48-decays or of @xmath2-decay ) + 2 ) whether the two - nucleon short - range correlations ( s.r.c . )",
    "are taken into account ( for realistic @xmath28 values neglecting s.r.c .",
    "would lead to a twofold increase in @xmath0 ) .    a moderate spread ( which can be as much as tens of % ) can originate from the difference choices of the mean field , many - body approximations ( rqrpa , sc - qrpa etc . ) , the size of the model space , the residual nucleon - nucleon interaction ( schematic zero - range or realistic interactions based on the @xmath3-matrix ) , renormalization of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath49 and the higher order terms ( h.o.t . ) of the nucleon current ( induced pseudoscalar and weak magnetism , about @xmath50 reduction in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the differences between many calculations are understandable just from the way @xmath28 was fixed , the considered size of the model space , the inclusion of the s.r.c . and other minor effects .    based on our analysis",
    ", we suggest that it is not appropriate to treat all calculated @xmath1-decay matrix elements at the same level , as it is commonly done ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and to estimate their uncertainty based on their spread . clearly , when some authors do not include effects that should be included ( e.g. the s.r.c",
    ". or the h.o.t . in the nucleon current ) their results should be either corrected or neglected .",
    "some effects are correlated , like the size of the model space and the renormalization of the particle - particle interaction .",
    "again , if those correlations are not taken into account , erroneous conclusion might be drawn . in our works",
    "@xcite we have shown that our way of fixing the model parameters removes , or at least greatly reduces , the dependence of the final result on most of the effects described above .    even after all relevant parameters have been carefully fixed , the qrpa is not able always to describe well all relevant weak transitions . in particular",
    ", it is sometimes impossible to describe simultaneously the @xmath2 decay rate as well as the @xmath51 and @xmath52 matrix elements connecting the @xmath41 ground states of the intermediate nucleus with the ground states of the final and initial nuclei ( @xmath43mo is a well known example of this problem , see e.g.  @xcite ) . that is an obvious drawback of the qrpa method ; it is never meant to describe in detail properties of non - collective states .",
    "but that is less relevant for the description of integral quantities that depend on sums over many states .",
    "the calculations of the @xmath1-decay matrix elements by civitarese and suhonen @xcite deserve more comments .",
    "the authors performed them within the approach suggested in  @xcite which employs the nucleon current derived from the quark wave functions . *",
    "it is very important to note that in this approach the two nucleon s.r.c .",
    "are not taken into account .",
    "* the h.o.t . of nucleon",
    "current were studied  @xcite with the conclusion of their minor role ( in contrast to our one ) .",
    "the extension of the work  @xcite for the case when @xmath28 is adjusted to reproduce the single @xmath48-decay amplitudes was presented in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the nuclear matrix elements are calculated in the same way as in @xcite , however , the obtained results differ significantly ( see table ii of  @xcite ) from each other . for some nuclei",
    "the difference is as large as a factor of two .",
    "there is no discussion of this there or in the later refs .",
    "it is noteworthy that the largest matrix element in  @xcite is found for the @xmath1-decay of @xmath53xe that disagrees with the results of other authors .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath1-decay of the @xmath53xe is explained by the closed neutron shell for this nucleus : a sharper fermi surface leads to a reduction of this transition .",
    "altogether , the matrix elements of @xcite are noticeably larger than the present ones .",
    "most of that difference can be attributed to the neglect of the s.r.c . and of the h.o.t .",
    "of the nucleon weak current in these papers .",
    "in summary of this section we list the main arguments why we believe that the procedure of adjustment used in our works  @xcite ( @xmath28 from the @xmath2-decay ) is preferable to the procedure advocated in @xcite ( @xmath28 from the single @xmath48-decay ) by suhonen and in  @xcite by suhonen and civitarese :    = = -=-5pt    \\i ) the qrpa is never meant to describe in detail properties of non - collective states like the single beta decay of the ground state of a nucleus .",
    "thus , it is more relevant to fix the qrpa parameters using an integral quantity like the @xmath2-decay half - life and not the beta decay of a single state .",
    "\\ii ) we have showed in @xcite that the first @xmath41 state of the intermediate nucleus is not the only one contributing to the @xmath2-decay amplitude .",
    "for instance , in a=76 system many excited intermediate @xmath41 states give comparable contributions ( fig .",
    "8 of  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , to give preference to the lowest state is not well - justified , the entire sum is actually what matters .",
    "\\iii ) the contribution of the @xmath41 multipole to the @xmath0 and the corresponding @xmath40 are correlated ( fig .  8 of  @xcite ) .",
    "making sure that the @xmath40 agrees with its experimental value constrains the @xmath41 part of the @xmath0 as well .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath41 multipole component of the @xmath0 to @xmath28 far exceeds sensitivity of the other multipoles .",
    "hence , making sure that the whole @xmath41 multipole is correct is crucial .",
    "\\iv ) the approach of fixing @xmath28 to reproduce the @xmath51 decay of the first @xmath41 state of the intermediate nucleus is limited only for nuclei with a=100 , 116 and 128 , where the ground state of the corresponding odd - odd nucleus has @xmath41 . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath2-decay half - life is known now practically for all nuclei of experimental interest , i.e. , one can use it to fix @xmath28 .",
    "\\v ) the running sum contributions to the @xmath0 in @xmath46ge and @xmath43mo ( figs .",
    "8,9 of  @xcite ) , for the different multipoles as well as for the total matrix element do not reveal a single state dominance .",
    "thus , it is not obvious that it is best to choose any particular state or transition for the adjustment .",
    "\\vi ) finally , adjusting @xmath28 to reproduce the @xmath2-decay half - life essentially removes the dependence on other parameters . while we have demonstrated that for all 9 nuclear systems , a similar proof was not given in @xcite .",
    "it clearly follows from the above analysis that the table 3 of @xcite does not reflect real physical situation and therefore should be disregarded .    in the very recent publications of civitarese and suhonen @xcite serious shortcomings",
    "are claimed in the procedure of fixing @xmath28 adopted by us .",
    "their criticism is based on the consideration of negative values of the @xmath2-decay matrix elements compatible with the data .",
    "but they have overlooked that if @xmath28 is fixed to reproduce the single @xmath48-decay data , the problem of negative values of the corresponding matrix elements is present as well . in  @xcite this criticism of  @xcite",
    "has been refuted by physical arguments which explain why solutions corresponding to the negative values of @xmath2-decay should not be considered .    it is also worth to mention that in  @xcite the calculations have been performed in the qrpa without consideration of the effect of two - nucleon short - range correlations .",
    "the higher multipolarities are strongly suppressed by the s.r.c . and h.o.t .",
    "in the nucleon current . thus there is no more a clear dominance of the @xmath45 multipolarity found in  @xcite .",
    "of course , the inclusion of the s.r.c . and",
    "the induced pseudoscalar coupling of nucleon current in the calculation of the @xmath0 is a question of physics and not just a matter of taste .",
    "in addition , a new factor @xmath54 introduced without any justification by civitarese and suhonen @xcite into the definition of the @xmath0 will definitely contribute to the confusion among the experimentalists working in the field .",
    "we have shown that the procedure suggested in our recent works , refs .",
    "@xcite , is applicable to essentially all nuclei with known @xmath2 decay lifetimes . adjusting the strength of the particle - particle neutron - proton force @xmath28 in such a way that the experimental @xmath2 decay rate is correctly reproduced removes much of the dependence on the size of the single - particle basis and whether qrpa or rqrpa is used .",
    "we have also shown that the quenching of the axial current matrix elements , parameterized by the reduction of the coupling constant @xmath18 , also leaves the resulting @xmath1 matrix elements almost unchanged ; they become insensitive to the variations of parameters describing the short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations as well .",
    "thus , the resulting @xmath1 matrix elements acquire well defined values , free of essentially arbitrary choices",
    ". we also present arguments while we believe that the chosen procedure of adjusting the interaction is preferable to other proposed ways of adjustment .",
    "the differences in most , albeit not all , published qrpa and rqrpa results can be understood .",
    "comparison between the results of different qrpa / rqrpa calculations would be facilitated if authors of future publications specify in detail what choices of explicit and implicit adjustable parameters they made , and discuss the dependence of their result on their particular choice . by following these suggestions a consensus among the practitioners of qrpa",
    "/ rqrpa could be reached and most of the spread between the calculated nuclear matrix elements , that causes much confusion in the wider physics community , would be shown to be essentially irrelevant . to reach a convergence of the results obtained",
    "using qrpa / rqrpa is clearly just an important step on the way to reliable and correct @xmath1 decay nuclear matrix elements .    the work of f.  . and v. r. was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grants 436 slk 17/298 , tu 7/134 - 1 and fa67/28 - 2 , respectively ) .",
