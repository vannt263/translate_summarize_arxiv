    "the properties of magnetic impurities in metals , and of small dots attached to metallic leads share many characteristics , due to the similar role played by electron electron interactions .",
    "the electrostatic repulsion leads to the formation of local moments@xcite , which are quenched at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "quantum dots are more complicated structures@xcite and an effective kondo hamiltonian can only be defined in the limit of large spacing between the electronic levels within the dot .",
    "then , the main physical processes at low temperatures are due to the changes of the occupancy of the level closest to the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "even if we assume this restriction , terms beyond the kondo hamiltonian can arise due to the finite extension and inhomogeneities of the electron states inside a mesoscopic quantum dot .",
    "the simplest of these additional interactions is an assisted hopping term , extensively studied in relation to bulk correlated systems@xcite .",
    "it can be shown that , within a systematic expansion in the intradot conductance , the leading correction to the intradot capacitance , or averaged coulomb interaction , has such a form@xcite . the inhomogeneous screening and effective `` orthogonality catastrophe \" which give rise to this term",
    "also lead to interesting non equilibrium effects in the metallic limit , when the level spacing is much less than the temperature@xcite .",
    "the present work analyzes the model of a correlated impurity , or quantum dot , in the limit where the low temperature physical properties are determined by a single electronic state within the dot , using the flow equations first proposed in refs . and .",
    "the method transforms the initial hamiltonian into a family of related hamiltonians by means of a sequence of unitary transformations .",
    "if adequately chosen , these transformations lead to simplified models , in a similar way to a renormalization group transformation .",
    "the method has proven useful for a variety of problems@xcite , and it has also been used to obtain the kondo hamiltonian from the anderson model@xcite .    in the following , we will apply the flow equation technique to the anderson hamiltonian with assisted hopping .",
    "this problem has been analyzed in@xcite using mean field techniques , but there are no more accurate studies in the literature .",
    "thus , besides the intrinsic interest of the model , this work provides a test case where the flow equation method is used to obtain information not available by other techniques .",
    "the next section presents the model , and describes how the flow equation method is applied .",
    "the results are discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv analyzes the main properties of the model , as derived by this method .",
    "we will study the hamiltonian :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the anderson hamiltonian , and the assisted hopping terms are included in @xmath4 .",
    "we have also defined @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we now perform a sequence of infinitesimal unitary transformations : @xmath7 \\label{transformation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these transformations are characterized by the anti - hermitian generator @xmath8 .",
    "the parameters of the initial hamiltonians become functions of the flow parameter @xmath9 and , if there are no upper indices on the parameters , it will be implied that they depend on @xmath9 .",
    "our main goal is to reduce the initial hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) to another whose physical properties are well understood .",
    "we assume that this is achieved if the assisted hopping term is made to flow to zero .",
    "hence , we impose the requirement @xmath10 this condition is satisfied if @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "more generally , we will employ the following generator : @xmath12 this expression differs from the generator used to cancel the hybridization with the band , @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , in that it contains an additional operator related to the localized orbital , @xmath14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the analytic treatment of the flow equations the explicit expression of the parameters @xmath15 is not needed .",
    "we only require that eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) holds .",
    "the physical properties of the impurity are determined by the flow of the on - site energy @xmath16 and the correlation energy @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "notice that the one particle hybridization in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , is not changed during the flow , i.e. , @xmath19 this is a consequence of our choice of the generator given in eq .",
    "( [ generator ] ) .",
    "the commutator @xmath20 $ ] generates new interactions which have to be included in the hamiltonian @xmath21 , which , in turn , will lead to other interactions .",
    "this infinite hierarchy needs to be decoupled in order for the method to be useful .",
    "this point is carefully discussed in@xcite , and we will follow the same procedure . we do not include the new operators in the flow , although they will appear in the fixed point hamiltonian . the role of these `` marginal '' operators will be discussed in section iiic .",
    "the resulting flow equations thus take on the simple form @xmath22 where we have introduced the occupation number @xmath23 , which arises from normal ordering the neglected operators@xcite .",
    "the procedure used here explicitly breaks particle - hole symmetry .",
    "note that there is no renormalization of the energies of the conduction electrons , @xmath24 , which is a typical feature of impurity problems@xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ floww ] ) , we obtain the general relation between the flow of the assisted hopping amplitudes and the generator of the infinitesimal transformations , @xmath25 inserting this expression in eqs .",
    "( [ flowd ] ) and ( [ flowu ] ) we obtain @xmath26 note that the above equations imply that @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote universal functions .",
    "these functions only depend on the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath32 .",
    "the above flow equations can also be treated semi - analytically by substituting the @xmath9-dependent parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the denominator by their fixed point values @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this strategy has proven to be successful in several related models.@xcite we can then integrate the equations ( [ flowe ] ) and ( [ flowu ] ) from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , using the constraint that @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath38 where we assume that the hybridization @xmath13 and the assisted hopping amplitude @xmath32 differ in sign@xcite .",
    "the spectral function is positive for the physically relevant parameter regime , where the hybridization amplitude is larger or comparable to the assisted hopping amplitude . with the above definition",
    "we obtain the final result @xmath39 where we have defined the fermi function @xmath40.@xcite",
    "in order to make the analysis more quantitative , we need to specify the density of states in the surrounding medium , described by the function @xmath41 , eq .",

    "the width of the conduction band in the leads is @xmath42 , and the fermi energy is @xmath43 .",

    "[ fixedpoint ] , the numerically exact universal functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 of eqs .",
    "( [ unif ] ) and ( [ unig ] ) are shown as functions of the scaling variable @xmath56 ( solid line ) .",
    "the coupling strengths were chosen to be @xmath57 and @xmath58.@xcite the semi - analytical solution ( dashed line ) given in eqs .",
    "( [ erenormalizedlld ] - [ urenormalizedggd ] ) qualitatively agrees with the exact solution .",
    "the main difference is that the kink in @xmath59 near @xmath60 which is present in the numerical solution is not adequately reproduced by our analytical approach , eq .",
    "( [ urenormalizedlld ] ) .",
    "this is due to the cruder decoupling scheme which does not incorportate energy - scale separation.it is interesting to note that at this point , the numerical solution yields @xmath61 .",
    "it will lead to significant differences for the phase diagram which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "( [ urenormalizedlld ] ) yields @xmath62 hence , for @xmath63 , the renormalized interaction can become negative .",
    "we thus define the critical initial correlation energy @xmath64 such that the renormalized correlation energy @xmath1 becomes zero , i.e. , @xmath65 @xmath64 depends on the inital on - site energy @xmath16 and we further restrict @xmath64 to be positive .",
    "the critical correlation energy @xmath64 is enhanced for positive on - site energies @xmath66 .",
    "this property can most clearly be seen from the analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ intepsilon ] ) and ( [ intu ] ) for @xmath67.@xcite then , the fermi function is constant , i.e. @xmath68 , and the integrals yield simple expressions . for the semi - elliptical coupling function ,",
    "we obtain for @xmath69 @xmath70    on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ phasedia ] , the critical correlation energy @xmath64 is shown as a function of the initial on - site energy @xmath16 as it follows from the numerical ( solid line ) and semi - analytical ( dashed line ) solution .",
    "the coupling strengths were again chosen to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the main difference between the two curves stems from the spike of @xmath71 around @xmath72 , seen on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fixedpoint ] .",
    "it is now interesting to consider the possibility of local pairing correlations .",
    "pair formation does not rely on particle - hole symmetry , in fact , asymmetries can actually enhance this phenomenon.@xcite but local pairing can only occur if - in addition to an effective negative correlation energy @xmath73 - the renormalized on - site energy @xmath0 lies sufficiently close to the chemical potential @xmath74.@xcite the local pairing regime is thus determined by the tradeoff between a high critical correlation energy @xmath64 and an effective on - site energy @xmath0 sufficiently close to the chemical potential .    to discuss the phase diagram of this local pairing regime we will only consider the numerical solution .",
    "this approach is more reliable since it incorporates a systematic decoupling of the assisted hopping term , starting with large and ending with small energy differences with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the results are presented on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ phasedia ] , where the critical correlation energy @xmath64 is shown as function of @xmath16 in the regime where @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , we distinguish between positive ( @xmath76 ) and negative ( @xmath77 ) renormalized on - site energy @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis predicts local pairing for values of @xmath16 which favor double occupancy , and @xmath78 . the mean field analysis in ref .",
    "gives local pairing for @xmath79 and a similar range of values of @xmath16 ( note that we are using here comparable hybridization with the band ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the strong renormalization of @xmath1 for @xmath80 only occurs at large values of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , it is not present in the semi - analytical solution which does not incorporate energy - scale separation . furthermore , there are fixed points for which @xmath82 , i.e. , a degeneracy between the zero - charge and two - charge state of the impurity .",
    "since the marginal interactions also include pseudo spin - pseudo spin couplings , this might give rise to the kondo effect in the charge channel , i.e. , in the mixed valence regime .",
    "we now analyze the marginal terms , which have been neglected so far .",
    "one term will be interpreted as a renormalization of the hybridization term @xmath13 .",
    "this identification is crucial since the assisted hopping term @xmath32 contains an effective hybridization term which must be present in the fixed point hamiltonian .",
    "another term will explicitly favor local pairing .",
    "as in the anderson model , the flow generates spin - spin and pseudo spin - pseudo spin couplings : @xmath83\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition to this interaction , the following term is also generated : @xmath84    the existence of these terms is independent of the assisted hopping interaction and has been discussed in detail in relation with the anderson model@xcite .",
    "there , @xmath85 gives rise to the well - known kondo behavior in the spin and charge sector , respectively .",
    "@xmath86 is usually neglected in the fixed point hamiltonian since the first term of eq .",
    "( [ neglectterms ] ) represents potential scattering of the conduction electrons and will be irrelevant for our discussion .",
    "the last term renormalizes the on - site energy by @xmath87 . for the semi - elliptical coupling function ( [ semicircular ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath88 according to eq .",
    "( [ vkk ] ) within the semi - analytical treatment .",
    "our approximation - not to include newly generated coupling terms into the flow of the hamiltonian - is thus consistent for @xmath89 . as in ref .",
    ", we will ignore all terms of eq .",
    "( [ neglectterms ] ) in the fixed point hamiltonian and assume that they can be taking into account by redefining the initial parameters .",
    "finally , the commutator @xmath90 $ ] also gives rise to the following pairing term : @xmath91\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the same shape as some of the contributions in @xmath85 , eq . ( [ hsw ] ) .",
    "the additional contributions of eq .",
    "( [ hsw ] - [ pair ] ) need to be included in the flow equation scheme . as these terms contain an even number of operators associated to the localized level , but the generator , eq .",
    "( [ generator ] ) , contains an odd number , these terms can not directly change the flow equations of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath33 , eqs.([flowd],[flowu ] ) .",
    "they can , however , change the flow of the assisted hopping term , eq .",
    "( [ floww ] ) , which will eventually modify eqs.([flowd ] ) and ( [ flowu ] ) .",
    "we will neglect this second order modification of the flow equations for @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "this approximation was initially introduced in@xcite and is based on the fact that @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "note that , provided that the flow equations are unchanged , the presence of these `` marginal '' terms in the fixed point hamiltonian does not alter the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "we now approximate the magnitude of these terms at the fixed point , neglecting their influence on the flow equations .",
    "we obtain : @xmath95    as mentioned earlier , @xmath85 arises in the analysis of the anderson hamiltonian , due to the effects of the hybridization between the state at the impurity and the conduction band , and can be derived by means of a schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite .",
    "hence , we can interpret these fixed point interactions as arising from an effective hopping term in the initial hamiltonian , which , indeed , can be obtained from a mean field decoupling of the assisted hopping term .",
    "@xmath96 will enhance the tendency towards pair formation .",
    "the kondo interactions generated in the anderson hamiltonian when the hybridization flows from @xmath97 to @xmath98 is@xcite : @xmath99 comparing this result with eq .",
    "( [ vkk ] ) , we obtain the following relation : @xmath100 where we introduced the parameters @xmath101 .",
    "the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 define the initial and final values of the effective hybridization needed to take into account the terms in @xmath85 , eq .",
    "( [ hsw ] ) .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) only makes sense for @xmath104 . in order to make a more systematic analysis , the flow of the hybridization amplitude @xmath13 needs to be included from the beginning .",
    "but for the relevant regime of local pairing , we have from the exact solution @xmath105 .",
    "we thus find the following renormalization : @xmath106 this is consistent with the mean field renormalization of the assisted hopping term with @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath107 also follows from @xmath108 .",
    "this shows that we can indeed identify eq .",
    "( [ hsw ] ) as a renormalization of the hybridization .",
    "we have studied a model of an impurity , or a quantum dot , with a single electronic level , an on - site repulsion term , hybridization , and assisted hopping .",
    "the flow equation method allows us to map the model onto an effective anderson model without assisted hopping , and with additional kondo couplings and pair hopping terms .",
    "the most interesting outcome of our calculation is that the value of the on - site electron - electron interaction can become attractive , because of the effect on the flow of the initial assisted hopping term .",
    "although the anderson model with attractive interactions has not been as extensively studied@xcite as the repulsive anderson model , we think that our mapping suffices to give a qualitative description of the physical properties of the model for the interesting case of a relatively strong assisted hopping term .",
    "note that , in addition to a renormalized on - site interaction term , terms which describe pair hopping between the impurity and the conduction band are generated .",
    "we expect that significant local pairing correlations will develop in this regime .",
    "this result is in agreement with general arguments which suggest that assisted hopping interactions tend to favor superconducting ground states@xcite , and with mean field studies of the same impurity model@xcite .",
    "a related tendency towards phase rigidity can be found in the limit where the level spacing within the impurity is negligible with respect to the other parameters@xcite .",
    "the model does not have electron - hole symmetry , and local pairing is mainly favored when the number of electrons at the impurity exceeds one ( half filling ) , and when the direct hopping and the assisted hoping terms have opposite signs , also in agreement with general properties of bulk systems .",
