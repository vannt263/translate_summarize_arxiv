    "hille inequalities have important applications in different fields of mathematics and physics , such as operator theory , fourier and harmonic analysis , complex analysis , analytic number theory and quantum information theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since its proof , in the _ annals of mathematics _ in 1931 , the ( multilinear and polynomial ) bohnenblust  hille inequalities were overlooked for decades ( see @xcite ) and only returned to the spotlights in the last few years with works of a. defant , l. frerick , j. ortega - cerd , m. ounaes , d. popa , u. schwarting , k. seip , among others .",

    "the original estimates for @xmath23 had a growth of order @xmath24 and only in 2011 ( @xcite ) the importance of this inequality was rediscovered and the estimates for @xmath23 were substantially improved ; in the aforementioned paper it is proved that @xmath23 can be chosen to be hypercontractive and , more precisely , @xmath25 this result , besides its mathematical importance , has striking applications in different contexts ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the case @xmath33 is the well - known littlewood s @xmath34 theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the original purpose of littlewood s @xmath34 theorem was to solve a problem of p.j .",
    "daniell on functions of bounded variation ( see @xcite ) ; on the other hand , the bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality was invented to solve bohr s famous absolute convergence problem within the theory of dirichlet series ( this subject is being recently explored by several authors ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some independent results were proven in the 1970 s where better upper bounds for @xmath35 were obtained , but it seems that the authors were not aware of the existence of the original results by bohnenblust and hille .",
    "the oblivion of the work of bohnenblust and hille in the past was so noticeable that blei s book @xcite ( 2001 ) states the bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality as the littlewood s @xmath36-inequality  and absolutely no mention to the paper of bohnenblust and hille is made at all .",
    "according to blei s book the littlewood s @xmath8-inequality  is originally due to a.m. davie ( @xcite , 1973 ) and ( independently ) to g. johnson and w. woodward ( @xcite , 1974 ) but as a matter of fact bohnenblust and hille s paper preceded the aforementioned works in more than 40 years .",
    "the present paper is divided into eleven short sections , and an appendix , as follows :    in section 2 we describe the main advances and uncertainties related to the search of the sharp constants in the multilinear bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality ; in section 3 we describe the state - of - the - art of the subject ; in section 4 we introduce some notation and announce the key result of this paper , called _ fundamental lemma _ ; in section 5 we present our main results ; sections 6,7 and 8 are focused on the proof of technical lemmata , the fundamental lemma and the main results ; in section 9 we sketch the same results in the case of complex scalars .",
    "section 10 is divided in three subsections devoted to the interplay between the kahane ",
    "salem  zygmund inequality and the bohnenblust  hille inequalities .",
    "the first subsection contains a quite straightforward proof of the optimality of the power @xmath37 in the polynomial and multilinear bohnenblust  hille inequalities .",

    "et al ( @xcite ) _ , bohnenblust and hille _ showed , through a highly nontrivial argument , that the exponent @xmath38 can not be improved _  or according to defant and schwarting @xcite , bohnenblust and hille showed _ with a sophisticated argument that the exponent @xmath38 is optimal_. our argument shows that the optimality of the exponent @xmath38 is a straightforward corollary of the kahane ",
    "zygmund inequality ; in fact , as it shall be clear in the text , we prove a formally stronger result . in the second subsection",
    "we sketch some ideas that may be useful in the investigation of lower bounds for the optimal constants of the complex polynomial bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality ; finally , in the third subsection we show how the bohnenblust  hille inequality can be used to prove the optimality of the power @xmath39 in the kahane  salem ",
    "zygmund inequality ( including the case of real scalars ) .",
    "section 11 deals with some open problems and directions . in a final _ appendix _",
    ", we adapt some of the techniques used along this paper to a wide range of parameters . more precisely , we can estimate the constants satisfying bohnenblust  hille type inequalities when the exponent @xmath16 is replaced by any @xmath17 .",
    "a series of very recent works ( see @xcite ) have investigated estimates for @xmath4 for the polynomial and multilinear cases .",
    "the first estimates for the constants @xmath4 indicate that one should expect an exponential growth for the optimal constants @xmath9 satisfying the multilinear bohnenblust ",

    "it is worth mentioning that the bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality also holds for the case of real scalars . in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we shall first work with real scalars . as a matter of fact ,",
    "since the upper estimates also hold for the complex case ( because these estimates are clearly bigger than the best known estimates for the complex case ( see @xcite ) ) our whole procedure encompasses both the real and complex cases . for the sake of completeness ( and",
    "since the complex case is the most important for applications ) in section 9 we present separate estimates for the complex case .    up to now the optimal values of these constants",
    "are unknown ( for details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark i , page 178 ) or @xcite and references therein ) . only very recently ( see @xcite ) quite surprising results were proved and new connections with different subjects have arisen :    * the sequence @xmath9 has a subexponential growth ( @xcite ) , * the sequence @xmath9 does not have a polynomial expression ( @xcite ) , * if @xmath43 ( real case ) or @xmath44 ( complex case ) , then @xmath45 ( @xcite ) . * the exact growth of @xmath46 is related to a conjecture of aaronson and ambainis @xcite about classical simulations of quantum query algorithms ( @xcite ) .    notwithstanding the recent advances a lot of mystery remains on the estimates of the optimal constants satisfying the multilinear ( and polynomial ) bohnenblust  hille inequality .",
    "even simple questions remain without solution :    * * problem 1 .",
    "* is @xmath9 increasing ? * * problem 2 .",
    "* does @xmath9 have a well behaved  growth ?",
    "these two questions ( mainly problem 2 ) , whose answers are quite likely positive ( but unfortunately unknown ) , are crucial barriers for the achievement of stronger results on the behavior of the optimal constants . for example",
    "the possibility of strong fluctuations on the optimal constants seems to be a barrier to directly conclude ( from ( ii ) above ) that the optimal constants have a subpolynomial growth .",
    "the problems above are well - characterized by the dichotomy theorem ( recently obtained in @xcite ) .      in @xcite , which can be considered a continuation of @xcite , a _ dichotomy theorem _ for the candidates of constants satisfying the multilinear bohnenblust ",

    "one of the main contributions of the present paper shows that @xmath55 for infinitely many values of @xmath56 . the central tool for proving the above estimate and related theorems is a result of independent interest which uncovers part of the uncertainties related to the subject : there exists a sequence @xmath47 satisfying the multilinear bohnenblust ",
    "hille inequality such that @xmath57    although we do not solve problems 1 and 2 , our results shall allow us to conclude , among other results , that the optimal multilinear bohnenblust  hille constants do have a subpolynomial growth and , moreover , a sub @xmath58-harmonic growth for @xmath59 in the real case and @xmath60 in the complex case ( see theorem [ tt55 ] and section 9 ) ; the main contributions of this paper shall be presented in section 5 .",
    "in view of the large amount of recent papers and preprints related to the subject , we shall dedicate some space to locate the contribution of the present paper in the current state - of - the - art of the subject .",
    "* in ( @xcite , 2009 ) , the bilinear version of the bohnenblust",
