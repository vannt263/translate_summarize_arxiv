    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however , its non - perturbative phenomena such as color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite are not yet fully understood .",
    "it is an intriguing subject to clarify the relation between these non - perturbative phenomena @xcite .    as for a possible evidence on the close relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "lattice qcd calculations have shown the almost simultaneous chiral and deconfinement transitions at finite temperature and in finite volume @xcite .",
    "actually , at the quenched level , the deconfinement phase transition is of the 1st order , and both polyakov loop @xmath4 and the chiral condensate @xmath5 jump at the same critical temperature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "( note that the chiral condensate and the hadron masses can be calculated from the quark propagator even at the quenched level @xcite . )    in the presence of dynamical quarks , the thermal phase transition of qcd is modified depending on the quark mass . in the chiral limit of @xmath6 ,",
    "chiral transition is of the 1st order @xcite .",
    "for the two light u , d - quarks and relatively heavy s - quark of @xmath7 , lattice qcd shows crossover at finite temperature , and hence , to be strict , there is no definite critical temperature @xcite .",
    "also in this case , almost coincidence of the two peak positions of the polyakov - loop susceptibility and the chiral susceptibility suggests a close relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite , although several lattice - qcd studies reported a little higher peak position of the polyakov - loop susceptibility than that of the light - quark chiral susceptibility @xcite . in the case of qcd - like",
    "theory with adjoint - representation fermions , however , two phase transitions of deconfinement and chiral restoration occur at two distinct temperatures @xcite .    in the dual - superconductor picture @xcite , the confinement is discussed in terms of the magnetic monopole which appears as the topological object in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite . by removing magnetic monopoles from the qcd vacuum ,",
    "both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are simultaneously lost , as shown in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that both phenomena are related via magnetic monopoles .",
    "similar results are also obtained by removing center vortices from the qcd vacuum in the maximal center gauge in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "however , it is not sufficient to prove the direct relationship , since removing such topological objects might be too fatal for most non - perturbative qcd phenomena @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the dirac operator is directly related to chiral symmetry breaking . as shown in the banks - casher relation ,",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath8 is proportional to the dirac zero - mode density @xcite , and chiral symmetry restoration is observed as a spectral gap of eigenmodes .",
    "therefore , in order to clarify correspondence between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , it is a promising approach to investigate confinement in terms of the dirac eigenmodes .    in gattringer",
    "s formula @xcite , the polyakov loop can be expressed by the sum of dirac spectra with twisted boundary condition on lattice @xcite . in our previous studies , we formulated a gauge - invariant dirac - mode expansion method in lattice qcd , and analyzed the contribution of dirac - modes to the wilson loop , the interquark potential , and the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chiral symmetry breaking , these studies indicate that the low - lying dirac eigenmodes are not relevant for confinement properties such as the area law of the wilson loop , the linear confining potential , and the zero expectation value of the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "it is also reported that hadrons still remain as bound states even without chiral symmetry breaking by removing low - lying dirac - modes @xcite .    in this paper , we perform the detailed analysis of the polyakov loop in terms of dirac eigenmodes , using the gauge - invariant dirac - mode expansion method @xcite . in fact , we remove low - lying or high dirac - modes from the qcd vacuum generated by lattice qcd , and then calculate the ir / uv - cut polyakov loop in both confined and deconfined phases to investigate the contribution of the removed dirac - modes to the confinement .",
    "we also discuss the temperature dependence of the ir / uv - cut polyakov loop . for the polyakov loop , unlike the wilson loop , we can develop a practical calculation after removing the low - lying dirac modes , by a reformulation with respect to the removed ir dirac - mode space , which enables us to calculate with larger lattices .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "we briefly review the dirac - mode expansion method in lattice qcd , and formulate the dirac - mode projected polyakov loop . in sec.iii",
    ", we show the lattice qcd results of the dirac - mode projected polyakov loop in both confined and deconfined phases at finite temperature . in sec.iv , we propose a new method to calculate the polyakov loop without ir dirac modes in a larger volume at finite temperature , by the reformulation with respect to the removed ir dirac - mode space .",
    "section v will be devoted to summary .",
    "in this section , we review the dirac - mode expansion method in lattice qcd @xcite , which is a gauge - invariant expansion with the dirac eigenmode",
    ". we also formulate the polyakov loop in the operator formalism of lattice qcd , and the dirac - mode projected polyakov loop . @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly review the gauge - invariant formalism of the dirac - mode expansion method in euclidean lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the lattice - qcd gauge action is constructed from the link - variable @xmath9 , which is defined as @xmath10 with the gluon field @xmath11 , lattice spacing @xmath12 , and gauge coupling constant @xmath13 @xcite . using the link - variable @xmath14 ,",

    "thus , the dirac operator becomes an anti - hermitian operator as @xmath22 and its eigenvalues are pure imaginary . we introduce the normalized eigenstate @xmath23 , which satisfies @xmath24 and @xmath25 . from the relation @xmath26",

    "we introduce the link - variable operator @xmath41 defined by the matrix element as @xmath42 as the product of the link - variable operator @xmath41 , the wilson loop operator @xmath43 and the polyakov loop operator @xmath44 can be defined , and their functional trace , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are found to coincide with the wilson loop @xmath47 and the polyakov loop @xmath4 , apart from an irrelevant constant factor @xcite .",
    "the dirac - mode matrix element @xmath48 of the link - variable operator can be expressed as @xmath49 by inserting @xmath50 and using the dirac eigenfunction ( [ eq : diraceigenfunction ] ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath48 is gauge - transformed as @xmath51 therefore , the matrix element @xmath48 is constructed in a gauge - invariant manner , apart from an irrelevant global phase factor @xmath38 @xcite .    by inserting the completeness relation @xmath52",
    "we can expand any operator @xmath53 in terms of the dirac - mode basis @xmath39 as @xmath54 this procedure is just an insertion of unity , and it is mathematically correct .",
    "this expression is the basis of the dirac - mode expansion method .",
    "now , we introduce the dirac - mode projection operator @xmath55 as @xmath56 for arbitrary subset @xmath57 of the eigenmode space .",
    "for example , ir and uv mode - cut operators are given by @xmath58 with the ir / uv cut @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 , because of @xmath63 .    using the eigenmode projection operator ,",
    "we define dirac - mode projected link - variable operator as @xmath64 by using this projected operator @xmath65 instead of the original link - variable operator @xmath41 , we can analyze the contribution of individual dirac eigenmode to the various quantities of qcd , such as the wilson loop @xcite . in general , this projection produces some non - locality",
    ". however , this non - locality would not be significant for the long - distance properties such as confinement @xcite .    here",
    ", we take the similar philosophy to clarify the importance of monopoles by removing them from the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "so far , by removing the monopoles from the gauge configuration generated by lattice qcd in the ma gauge and by checking its effect , several studies have shown the important role of monopoles to the nonperturbative phenomena such as confinement @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , and instantons @xcite .",
    "note that , instead of the dirac - mode basis , one can expand the link - variable operator with arbitrary eigenmode basis of appropriate operator in qcd .",
    "for example , it would be also interesting to analyze the qcd phenomena in terms of the eigenmodes of the covariant laplacian operator @xmath66 @xcite and the faddeev - popov operator @xmath67 in the coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the use of the dirac operator are the gauge covariance and the lorentz covariance .",
    "in addition to these symmetries , the dirac operator is directly related to chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , and also topological charge via atiyah - singer s index theorem @xcite .",
    "in fact , the chiral condensate @xmath68 is proportional to the dirac zero - mode density as @xmath69 which is known as the banks - casher relation @xcite . here , @xmath70 is the spectral density of the dirac operator , and is given by @xmath71 with four - dimensional space - time volume @xmath72 .",
    "we also note that the low - lying dirac - mode is closely related to instantons . by filtering ultraviolet eigenmodes ,",
    "instanton - like structure is clearly revealed without cooling or smearing techniques @xcite .",
    "in fact , dirac eigenfunctions are useful probes to investigate the topological structure of the qcd vacuum .    for the dirac - mode expansion",

    ", it can be proven that the ks dirac - mode expansion gives the same result as the original dirac - mode expansion @xcite .",
    "next , we formulate the polyakov loop in the operator formalism , and the dirac - mode projected polyakov loop in su(3 ) lattice qcd with the space - time volume @xmath76 and the ordinary periodic boundary condition . using the temporal link - variable operator @xmath77 , the polyakov - loop operator @xmath44 is defined as @xmath78 in the operator formalism . by taking the functional trace `` tr ''",

    "we also investigate the effect of removing intermediate dirac - modes in appendix a. note that , even the non - locality appears through the dirac - mode projection , its effect just gives an extension to the polyakov line , so that its infrared effect should be negligible for the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "we study the polyakov loop and the @xmath1 center symmetry in terms of the dirac mode in su(3 ) lattice qcd at the quenched level , using the standard plaquette action and the ordinary periodic boundary condition .",
    "we adopt the jackknife method to estimate the statistical error .    in this section , we calculate full eigenmodes of the dirac operator using lapack @xcite , and perform the dirac - mode removal from the nonperturbative vacuum generated by lattice qcd calculations .",
    "we investigate the polyakov loop without the specific dirac - modes , showing the full figure of the dirac spectrum . for the reduction of the computational cost",
    ", we utilize the kogut - susskind ( ks ) formalism @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain the full dirac eigenmodes , the reduced computational cost is still quite large , and then we take relatively small lattices , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the calculation with larger lattice of @xmath3",
    "will be discussed in sec.iv .      in this subsection",
    ", we mainly analyze the contribution of the low - lying dirac modes to the polyakov loop in the confined phase below @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath2 , the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath85 is very small , and would be exactly zero in infinite volume .",
    "then , one may simply consider that any part of zero is zero and any type of filtering leaves zero unchanged .",
    "however , this is not correct .",
    "for example , after the filtering of the monopole removal in the ma gauge , the polyakov loop has a non - zero expectation value in the remaining system called as the photon part , even at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "similarly , the confinement property is lost by the removal of center vortices in the maximal center gauge @xcite , or by cutting off the infrared - momentum gluons in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "we also comment on the other filtering of smearing and cooling methods , which are popular techniques to remove quantum fluctuations @xcite . using these methods ,",
    "the low - lying dirac eigenmode density is reduced @xcite , and confinement property will be lost after many iterations of the cooling .",
    "these filtering operations actually change the polyakov loop from zero even at low temperatures .",
    "in fact , after some filtering , it is nontrivial whether the system keeps @xmath86 or not .    here",
    ", we consider an interesting filtering of the dirac - mode projection , introduced in the previous section .",
