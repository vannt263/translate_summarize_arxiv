    "<S> in the recent years , much attention has been devoted to the inhomogeneous nature of the mechanical response at the nano - scale in disordered solids . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the elastic heterogeneities that have been characterized in this context are expected to strongly impact the nature of the sound waves which , in contrast to the case of perfect crystals , can not be completely rationalized in terms of phonons . building on previous work on a toy model showing an amorphisation transition [ mizuno h , mossa s , barrat jl ( 2013 ) epl * 104*:56001 ] , we investigate the relationship between sound waves and elastic heterogeneities in a unified framework , by continuously interpolating from the perfect crystal , through increasingly defective phases , to fully developed glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we provide strong evidence of a direct correlation between sound waves features and the extent of the heterogeneous mechanical response at the nano - scale . </S>"
