    "in the recent developments of density functional ( df ) approximations for the free energy of hard molecules the fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) , pioneered by rosenfeld @xcite and explored in different directions by other authors @xcite , stands at a prominent position both because of its peculiar functional structure and because of the combination of success and pitfalls obtained with its different versions . in this paper",
    "we analyze the generic mathematical structure of the different density functional approximations and discuss its implication for the generalization of a recent version of fmt to mixtures of hard spheres with different radii .",
    "the theories developed to approximate the interaction part of the free energy density functional @xmath0\\equiv \\beta(f[\\rho]- f_{\\rm id}[\\rho])$ ] , with @xmath1 , beyond the simplest local density and square gradient approximations , are all based on a similar scheme : the non - local dependence on the density distribution @xmath2 appears through ` averaged ' or ` weighted ' densities defined as convolutions @xmath3 with several ( @xmath4 ) weight functions , @xmath5 , which depends only on the relative position of two points .",
    "the density functional @xmath0 $ ] is then written as the volume integral of a function of @xmath2 and/or the weighted densities @xmath6 .",

    "however , the second and followings terms in can not be reproduced within the generic forms used in the df approximations . in the diagrammatic expansion used in the theory of liquids @xcite ,",
    "the free energy is given by the irreducible diagrams ( with mayer function links ) , which can not be evaluated as a single volume integral of simpler factors , while the generic form of the df approximations includes only reducible diagrams with @xmath13 links .",

    "the first term in is reproduced by most df approximations , but the first term in , and hence the second term in for arbitrary density distributions , can not be reproduced within those df forms .",
    "this contradiction between the exact forms and the usual choices for the mathematical structure of the df approximations is forced by the computational cost of evaluating irreducible terms .",
    "the inclusion of kernel functions with more than two centers in the convolutions of @xmath2 would make it difficult to use the df approximation for practical purposes .",
    "the weighted density approximation ( wda ) @xcite gives a good example of the compromise between accuracy and practical computability in df approximations .",

    "this being so , the wda and similar approximations give a blurred representation of the exact non - local dependence of @xmath0 $ ] on @xmath2 , where the sharp step - like dependence on the hs mayer function in  is replaced by an easier to compute but smoother functional .",
    "the extension of this type of df to mixtures of hs with different radii @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is difficult , because they require @xmath28 weight functions to reproduce the mayer functions @xmath29 for any pair of molecules , and the ` extended ' weights required to mimic the irreducible diagrams for any triplet ( @xmath30 ) proliferate into an embarrassing large number of possible combinations for the functional @xmath0 $ ] .",

    "this can be explicitly seen if we write the kernel as @xmath126\\cdot v_{ijk}({\\bf r}'_1,{\\bf r}'_2 , { \\bf r}'_3 ) , \\label{newk2}\\ ] ] and now rotate @xmath127 slightly away of coaxiality while maintaining the three vectors in the same plane and with common origin ( see ) . if the displacement is given by the vector @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) then @xmath130 , i.e.   @xmath131 replacing @xmath127 by @xmath132 in yields ( remember that @xmath133 for coaxial vectors ) @xmath134 \\cdot v_{ijk}({\\bf r}'_1,{\\bf r}'_2,{\\bf r}'_3)+\\or(|\\bepsilon|^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eps2}\\ ] ] clearly , if @xmath128 fulfills and the r.h.s .  of does not vanish ( which happens , for instance , if @xmath127 and @xmath128 are coplanar ) , so does @xmath135 , so the kernel may have both signs , as stated .",
    "a negative singularity is formally the worst defect a free energy density functional can have , because it implies that the absolute minimum of the free - energy functional is minus infinity , and it is reached for very singular density distributions . in practice , however , this defect can be overcome with a restricted minimization of the free energy within a functional family which does not include those singular distributions .",
    "thus , the strong negative divergence of the original fmt proposal - for delta function density distributions , which precluded its use for crystals and narrow 0d cavities , does not interfere with its use ( and very good results ) for systems with planar symmetry , when the free energy is minimized with respect to planar density profiles @xmath136 , independent of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the remaining negative divergences in our new version are by far much weaker than those in , and they would be harmless for almost any virtual application of density functional theory with the variational minimization of the free energy constrained to families of functions ( uniform in one or two variables , like in the adsorption at walls or in pores ; periodic , like in freezing ; etc . ) .",

    "although the difference is now more visible , it is still negligible.,width=288 ]    in view of these numerical tests we conclude that functional , is preferable to the corrected one , despite its inability to recover the one - dimensional free energy exactly , simply because its structure is far simpler and more suitable to be applied to polydisperse mixtures ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the main conclusion of the analysis we have performed on the construction of a fundamental measure functional for mixtures of hard spheres is that , as stated in the title , we appear to be ` close to the edge ' of fundamental measure theory , in the sense that its internal structure seems almost exhausted .",
    "there are two main drawbacks that seem unavoidable within the present scheme , both related to the structure of the third term @xmath54 $ ] in .",
    "the first problem is common to all the fmt versions and it concerns the existence of ` lost cases ' , i.e.the fact that configurations of three spheres with pairwise overlap but no triple overlap do not make any contribution to the functional .",
    "this reflects in that the lowest order of @xmath165 is incorrectly predicted ( it vanishes for the lost cases , where it should still be 1 ) .",
    "the obvious way to repair this defect is to introduce two point measures joining two ` halves ' of mayer functions .",
    "this would be a qualitative departure from the fmt structure , which would recover the exact @xmath165 at low density , but the increase in computational complexity would be considerable . another way to circumvent this problem , while keeping the fmt structure and low computational cost , would be to replace the delta functions in the definition of @xmath54 $ ] by some other functions having a ` tail ' extending beyond the radii of the particles ( and presumably vanishing when particles no longer overlap ) .",
    "although we can not definitely exclude this possibility , we have tried several functional forms without success .",
    "this seems to be a too drastic change within the fundamental measure scheme , so much that adding such tails would ` break down ' the functional at some other point . in particular , the dimensional crossover ( to the exact 1d limit and to 0d cavities , strongly related to the density distribution in crystals ) is a very stringent , hence fragile , requirement for an approximate functional , so virtually any modification can spoil it .",
    "the existence of these lost cases forces to overweight the other configurations in order to compensate for the nonexistent ones and guarantee a reasonable equation of state .",
    "but as and show , this compensation introduces a dramatic bias in the case of mixtures of very dissimilar spheres . this may , at least in principle , have important consequences for the depletion effect in these systems and thus may affect phase behaviour , at least in its use to describe crystalline phases .",
    "although in the application to planar density profiles , the effect would be strongly reduced by the averaging over the transverse directions .",
    "the problem of the lost cases seems to be inherent to the fundamental measure structure with a notable exception : parallel hard parallelepipeds @xcite .",
    "the peculiar shape of these bodies makes pairwise overlap and triple overlap to be equivalent conditions , so there are no lost cases for this particular form of the particles , and hence the lowest order in @xmath165 is exactly recovered .",
    "the second problem , also associated to @xmath54 $ ] , depends on the choice of the kernel function @xmath105 in , which marks the difference between the fmt versions proposed in the literature .",
    "the balance here comes between the computational cost and the existence of spurious divergences ( of positive or negative sign ) in the free energy .",
    "the original form proposed by rosenfeld factorizes in terms of the scalar and vector weighted densities , but the negative divergences show up in the reduction to 1d and to 0d distributions .",
    "simpler versions ( for the monocomponent case ) using no kernel function and only the scalar weighted density @xcite give much stronger divergences ( showing up even at the bulk fluid direct correlation function @xmath166 ) but always with positive sign , so that in the minimization of the free energy those configurations contributing to the divergences are avoided , e.g. creating spurious kinks in the density profiles of a wall - fluid interface , but without the qualitative breakdown of for strongly confined systems .",
    "in contrast , the fmt version based on the exact reduction to the 0d limit @xcite would have no divergences of the free energy at all , but it has a non - separable kernel with enormous computational cost ( implying the multiple integrals over the densities at three different points ) . the proposal made in @xcite and used by groh and mulder @xcite of taking @xmath167 ^ 2 $ ] would also kill all the divergences at the boundary between overlapping and non - overlapping spheres , and be separable in terms of the scalar , vector and a rank - two tensor weighted densities .",
    "however , this form gives a too smooth boundary behaviour for , since the kernel vanishes as the function @xmath168 in the square root of denominator in , while the step - like dependence would require a non - separable kernel proportional to @xmath169 .",
    "the alternative kernel and df , proposed and successfully used @xcite for monocomponent hs systems , achieved the separability ( in term of the same set of weighted densities ) and the sharpness ( with the exact contribution to the triangle diagram for the bulk fluid ) , at the price of unleashing some weak divergences of positive sign of the free energy for some peculiar configurations of non - aligned molecules .",
    "the effect of those divergences would be extremely difficult to observe and the quality of that df approximation seems to be limited mainly by the quality of the percus - yevick equation of state for the bulk hs fluid , and the associated condition of having a direct correlation function with the range of the hard core diameter @xcite , which is also intrinsic to the fmt .",
    "the extension to hs mixtures imposes more severe restrictions , since the form for hs of unequal size has ( positive ) divergences for peculiar aligned configurations which were not present for equal sized hs and which give stronger contributions than those of non - aligned configurations .",
    "their main drawback is to spoil the exact reduction to the 1d limit , which was one of the most remarkable achievements for the monocomponent case .",
    "we have introduced here a new kernel form which would recover that dimensional reduction for hs mixtures , at the price of introducing a new rank - three tensorial weighted density and creating some weak negative divergences for some non - aligned configurations .",
    "besides , the radii - dependent coefficients of this new kernel are not simply products of powers of the radii , but more complicated rational functions , so it turns out to be computationally more involved in applications to , for instance , polydisperse mixtures .",
    "other possibilities remain for a candidate kernel , like squaring the one we propose , conveniently adjusting the coefficients ; however this forces the introduction of very high rank tensor weights and removes the discontinuity of @xmath165 , thus creating both computational and structural problems .    altogether , the systematic improvement of the free energy density functional within the fmt seems to be frustrated by incompatible requirements , deeply rooted in the structure of the theory .",
    "thus , one has to choose a functional form on the basis of its performance for the required practical use .",
    "the original proposal by rosenfeld is quite accurate for systems with planar symmetry , for which the improvement obtained with the newer versions is purely marginal .",
    "the fmt version , with a moderate increase of the computational cost due to the presence of the tensorial weighted density , would give similar results as for planar systems but it is also good for crystalline phases or other strongly confined density distributions . in the 1d limit",
    "it does not recover the exact df for arbitrary distributions , but making a rather small error unless the 1d system is very close to the close packing limit .",
    "the extra computational cost of the fmt version , with a rank - three tensor and non - additivity of the weighted densities in terms of a few moments of the radii , would only be worth for problems in which the exact 1d reduction is crucial and the spurious negative divergences of this free energy df are made innocuous by the parametrization of the density distribution .",
    "it seems very unlikely that these two constrains appear in a practical problem , so that probably is the best practical choice .",
    "to conclude , we have to point that the problems and limitations of the fmt density functionals , which we have explored here , should be considered in the right perspective , as we are asking the fmt functionals to perform well in problems which would be out of question for any other type of df approximation .",
    "the exact ( or nearly exact ) reduction from three dimensional density distributions to the 1d limit , and the accurate behaviour in very narrow cavities , which opens the description of the crystalline phases with unconstrained density distributions , are fully out of range for the wda or other df approximations .",
    "the presence of spurious divergences in the fmt is the price to be paid for the sharpness of its non - local dependence , compared with the blurred dependence of the other df approaches .",
    "the taming of those divergences to make them innocuous has been the ` holy grail ' of the workers in the field , starting from rosenfeld s choice for the combinations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in and .",
    "the ` earthly ' requirements of practical computability make that ` grail ' unreachable , but the new versions explored here seem to be close enough to it for most practical purposes , providing by far the best density functional approximations for systems of hs mixtures .",
