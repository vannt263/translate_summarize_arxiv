    "numerous unresolved aspects of the theory of star formation depend on a detailed knowledge of the structure of the interstellar medium in star - forming regions .",
    "for example , it is well established that the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds gives rise to a variety of small - scale structures , some of which collapse gravitationally to form stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not clear what determines the final , relatively invariant distribution of stellar masses . in order to identify the processes which set the stellar mass function",
    ", we must first know how the masses of pre - stellar cores and clumps are distributed .",
    "submillimeter continuum observations of low - mass star - forming regions have suggested that the mass function of dense clumps with masses less than a few @xmath6 resembles the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) over the same mass range @xcite .",
    "it is less clear how the mass function of massive clumps / cores relates to that of massive stars , mostly due to a lack of submillimeter continuum observations of massive star - forming regions at sufficiently high resolution .",
    "the relationship between the masses of cores and stars is especially important at higher masses because it could help to distinguish between competing theories of high - mass star - formation .",
    "according to the two prevailing theories , massive stars may form either by the monolithic collapse of individual molecular cloud cores @xcite , aided by the formation of a disk and an optically thin outflow cavity , or by the competitive accretion of material from the larger reservoir of an entire proto - cluster @xcite . in principle",
    ", we should expect a closer resemblance between the mass functions of cores and stars in the first case than in the second . whatever the formation mechanism of massive stars , it is likely to have signature in the clump / core mass function .    to date , only a handful of studies",
    "have measured the submillimeter continuum mass function of cores and clumps at and beyond the high - mass end of the stellar mass range ( @xcite , `` paper  i '' hereafter ) . because the mean distance to massive star - forming regions is large compared to their low - mass counterparts ,",
    "most studies of such regions have been sensitive only to spatial and mass scales significantly larger than those of pre - stellar clumps @xcite . in this",
    "paper and paper  i , we present submillimeter continuum maps of two relatively nearby massive star - forming regions , in which it is possible to discern structures which may form individual stars .",
    "paper  i concentrated on ngc  7538 , a massive star - forming region at a distance of 2.8  kpc .",
    "the focus of this paper is m17 which , at a distance of @xmath7  kpc @xcite , is near enough to permit us to discern candidate pre - stellar condensations .",
    "the @xmath28  beam of the james clerk maxwell telescope at 450  @xmath1 m  translates to a linear resolution of @xmath20.06  pc ( @xmath21.3@xmath8 au ) at 1.6  kpc , which is comparable to the resolution obtained in similar observations of nearby low - mass star - forming regions ( typically 0.010.03  pc ) .",
    "a large - scale co @xmath9=1@xmath100 map of m17 shows it to be divided into northern and southern parts whose combined mass exceeds @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the best - known features of the region are the well - studied photon - dominated region and the molecular cloud it borders , m17sw ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "m17sw exhibits many signs of massive star formation , including an ultracompact hii ( uchii ) region , numerous locations of maser activity , and a cluster of young o and b type stars @xcite . in their survey of 69 stars in m17",
    ", @xcite found 20 stars with strong infrared excesses and luminosities more than 60 times those of class  i sources in @xmath12  oph .",
    "they identify these sources as candidate massive class  i analogs , which suggests that there is a significant population of young , early type massive stars in the region .",
    "because we are interested in studying the earliest stages of massive star formation , rather than study m17sw , where massive star formation is already well underway , we focus instead on the northern part of m17 , in the region around the compact source m17n .",
    "the co maps of @xcite and @xcite show the m17n region to be rich in molecular gas , but radio continuum studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) show it to be relatively devoid of free - free emission , which suggests it is relatively free of ionizing massive stars .",
    "most of the detected radio continuum emission originates in the uchii region associated with m17n @xcite , which coincides with an h@xmath13o maser @xcite .",
    "at least 5 infrared point sources in the immediate vicinity of m17n are believed to be embedded stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a 3@xmath144  map of the region around m17n at 1.3  mm with the iram  30 m telescope , which revealed the extended , clumpy nature of the dust continuum emission . in order to identify new cold , dusty clumps in the m17n region and to characterize their mass function ,",
    "we have obtained larger , more sensitive maps of the region at 450  @xmath1 m  and 850  @xmath1 m . in  [ sec : obs ] , we describe our observations and data reduction techniques . in  [ sec : props ] , we discuss the properties of the clumps .",
    "section [ sec : m17massfunc ] is devoted to a detailed analysis of the m17 clump mass function , including comparisons to the mass function of co clumps and the stellar imf . in paper",
    "iii , the results of papers  i and ii will be compared quantitatively to the clump mass functions measured in other star - forming regions , with the goal of determining a general functional form for the clump mass function .",
    "we used the submillimeter common - user bolometer array on the james clerk maxwell telescope to map an approximately 12@xmath1412  ( 5.5@xmath145.5 pc ) region of m17 .",
    "the data were acquired on the nights of 2003 march 17 and april 16 with a total on - source integration time of about 5 hr . the data were taken in the standard scan - mapping mode with chop throws of 30 , 44 , and 68  in both right ascension and declination .",
    "pointing checks were performed once per hour and sky dips once every hour or two .",
    "the rms pointing accuracy was approximately 1.7 .",
    "mars was used as the flux calibrator and was observed every 34 hours ; the derived uncertainties in the gain calibrations were 4% at 450  @xmath1 m  and 12% at 850  @xmath1 m .",
    "the sky opacities at 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  were calculated using polynomial fits to the combination of the jcmt skydips and the 225 ghz zenith optical depth measurements from the caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "the mean 225  ghz zenith optical depths on the two nights were 0.093 and 0.054 , respectively .",
    "the mean residuals from the polynomial fits to the optical depth data translate into a systematic uncertainty in the fluxes of less than 1% .",
    "we used the standard techniques for reducing and calibrating scuba scan maps ( detailed in paper  i ) , including map reconstruction with the emerson2 algorithm @xcite .",
    "the mean rms flux measured in emission - free regions of the maps is 0.027 jy  beam@xmath15 at 850  @xmath1 m  and 0.32 jy  beam@xmath15 at 450  @xmath1 m .",
    "these rms fluxes are somewhat higher than those from paper  i ( 0.021  jy  beam@xmath15 and 0.18  jy  beam@xmath15 at 850  @xmath1 m   and 450  @xmath1 m , respectively ) , but m17 is nearly twice as close as ngc  7538 , making the m17 maps significantly more sensitive in terms of luminosity .",
    "the half power beam widths at the two wavelengths were 15.4  and 8.5 , respectively .",
    "we used the `` image flattening '' technique described in paper  i to remove spurious large - scale structure introduced during reconstruction of the scan map using the emerson2 technique .",
    "the flattening technique consists of clipping the brightest emission peaks from the map , smoothing the remainder to approximate the large - scale background of the map , and subtracting the result from the original map .",
    "the technique preserves all structure on scales smaller than approximately twice the size of the largest chop throw , or about 2 . because the strongest source in the maps ( m17n ) is considerably weaker than the strongest source in the ngc  7538 region , the small artifacts introduced by the flattening technique are even smaller in the m17 maps than in the ngc  7538 maps .",
    "the only visible effect of the flattening procedure is a slight reduction in the brightness of the structure extending northward from m17n .",
    "the 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  maps are shown in figures  [ fig : m17850map ] and [ fig : m17450map ] , respectively .",
    "we used _ clfind2d _  @xcite to locate the clumps in our maps and determine their boundaries and integrated fluxes . to be considered a clump ,",
    "an object must satisfy three criteria : its area must be at least half that of the beam , its peak flux must be at least 5  @xmath16 , and it must have a flux of @xmath17 in every pixel . using _ clfind2d _  with these detectability criteria",
    ", we identified 121 clumps in the 850  @xmath1 m  image and 101 in the 450  @xmath1 m  image .",
    "the properties of the 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  clumps are listed in tables [ tab : m17850clumps ] and [ tab : m17450clumps ] , respectively .",
    "note that the clump radii stated throughout this paper are the effective radii of the clumps , deconvolved from the beam .",
    "the effective radius of a clump is defined as the radius of a circle with an area equal to the projected area of the clump .",
    "as we are principally interested in the dust continuum emission of each clump , we must correct the fluxes for three likely sources of contamination : radio continuum emission , co @xmath9=3@xmath102 line emission in the 850  @xmath1 m  filter , and the sometimes substantial jcmt error beam .",
    "radio continuum contamination is principally a concern in m17n , which harbors an uchii region @xcite , and in the southeastern part of the map , where some of the dust continuum emission is coincident with the `` northern bar '' structure seen in numerous radio continuum studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . combining the measured 1.4 and 3.5  cm radio continuum fluxes of m17n from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , with the assumption that the radio continuum emission follows a power law of the form @xmath19",
    ", we estimate the radio continuum contamination of m17n at 850  @xmath1 m  to be @xmath230% , or @xmath22.2  jy .",
    "we used the 6  cm map of @xcite to estimate radio continuum corrections to the 850  @xmath1 m  fluxes of the 18 clumps which are coincident with the northern bar , again assuming the @xmath20 scaling relationship .",
    "the corrections to the 850  @xmath1 m  fluxes derived in this way ranged from 4 to 45% , but were typically less than 20% .",
    "radio continuum corrections to the 450  @xmath1 m  fluxes were found to be negligible .",
    "the remainder of the clumps in the map are not coincident with any known radio continuum sources ( see , for example , the map of @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of co  @xmath9=3@xmath102 contamination corrections is complicated by the lack of a co  @xmath9=3@xmath102 map with the same spatial resolution and coverage as our continuum maps .",
    "the closest match is the co  @xmath9=3@xmath102  map of @xcite , which completely covers our map , but is not fully sampled .",
    "the @xcite map was made using the position - switching technique instead of chopping .",
    "thus , it traces the total column of co  @xmath9=3@xmath102 , while our chopped maps can suffer contamination only from co  @xmath9=3@xmath102  emission on scales smaller than about twice our largest chop throw , or @xmath22 . comparing our maps to those of @xcite",
    "reveals that most of the co structure in the region of overlap occurs on large spatial scales , greater than 2 .",
    "hence , most of this emission would be chopped out in our map , and would not contaminate the 850  @xmath1 m  fluxes .",
    "we expect the co contamination to be worst close to m17n , where the co emission peaks .",
    "we estimate that the co contamination of the 850  @xmath1 m  flux of the clump associated with m17n would be about 26% if we were sensitive to the total column of co , but half or less than that in the chopped map .",
    "because the degree of co contamination is difficult to estimate , but likely less than 10% in most clumps , we have not applied co corrections to our data .      the jcmt beam can be reasonably approximated by a sum of gaussian components : a strong , narrow primary beam and a broad , faint error beam . in paper",
    "i , we described our method for fitting the beam structure using our calibrator observations . in this work",
    ", we used the same beam fits as in paper  i to correct the integrated flux of each clump .",
    "the error beam corrections at 850  @xmath1 m  ranged from 3 to 14% with a mean of 10% .",
    "the equivalent corrections at 450  @xmath1 m  ranged from 3 to 18% with a mean value of 11% .",
    "we have used the combination of our 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  maps to measure the spectral index , @xmath21 , of each clump , and thereby to estimate its temperature .",
    "the spectral index in a given pixel of the map is defined as :    @xmath22    as described in detail in paper  i , it is necessary first to match the beams of the two images by convolving each map with the beam at the other wavelength .",
    "this method not only ensures that the resolutions of the two maps match , but also that their error beam structures match .",
    "we applied the _",
    "_  boundaries of the 850  @xmath1 m  clumps to the spectral index map to calculate the flux - weighted mean spectral index of each 850  @xmath1 m  clump . in computing the flux - weighted mean spectral index , we weight the spectral index of each pixel by the flux of the corresponding pixel in the convolved ( i.e. resolution - matched ) 850  @xmath1 m  map . only pixels detected at @xmath23 at both 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  are included in the mean .",
    "the mean spectral indices so calculated are given in table [ tab : m17850clumps ] .",
    "the @xmath218  beam of the spectral index map prohibits direct comparison between it and the 450  @xmath1 m  map , whose beam is less than half as broad . the broader @xmath215  beam of the 850  @xmath1 m  map permits direct comparisons with the spectral index map .",
    "making this comparison , we find , as in paper  i , that continuum emission peaks in the 850  @xmath1 m  map are strongly correlated with peaks in the spectral index map",
    ".    we can use the derived spectral indices to estimate the mean temperature of each clump .",
    "the mean flux ratio of a clump is related to its mean dust temperature , @xmath24 , and mean dust emissivity index , @xmath25 by :    @xmath26    where angle brackets denote spatial averages over each clump s area and the numerical exponents are the @xmath27 terms from the planck function .",
    "although we expect @xmath28 to vary somewhat with varying dust properties throughout massive star - forming regions , we presently have no means by which to quantify these variations . for simplicity , we assume a spatially invariant value of @xmath29 , consistent with the results of @xcite , who derived @xmath30 for m17n , and @xcite , who derived @xmath28 values ranging from 1.2 to 2 for massive clumps in ngc  7538 .    using our assumed @xmath28 value and the flux ratios derived from the spectral index map",
    ", we can use equation [ eq : tdust ] to compute the mean dust temperature of each clump .",
    "again , due to the resolution mismatch between the 450  @xmath1 m  and spectral index maps , this technique can only be applied to the 850  @xmath1 m  clumps .",
    "note that it is not possible to estimate temperatures for all of the 850  @xmath1 m  clumps .",
    "the spectral index map contains only those pixels detected at @xmath23 in both the 850  @xmath1 m   and 450  @xmath1 m  images , so no spectral index can be derived for the thirteen 850  @xmath1 m  clumps which are not strongly detected at 450  @xmath1 m .",
    "an additional ten clumps have measured flux ratios which are larger than the high temperature asymptotic value of the flux ratio from eq .",
    "[ eq : tdust ] .",
    "the presence of such high flux ratios probably reflects a breakdown in our assumption of a spatially invariant @xmath28 , with unusually high flux ratios tracing regions of elevated @xmath28 .",
    "the estimated temperatures of the remaining 98 clumps are given in table [ tab : m17850clumps ] .",
    "they range from 6 to 235  k , with a mean value of 33  k and a median value of 20  k. we derive the random uncertainties on these temperatures from the uncertainties in the gains , sky opacities , and the error beam fits .",
    "the exponential form of equation  [ eq : tdust ] dictates that the width of the temperature uncertainty interval increases rapidly with temperature and that the upper uncertainty interval quickly exceeds the lower .",
    "typical random uncertainties on the estimated temperatures , which derive from the uncertainties in the gain and sky opacity calibrations , are @xmath31  k below 10  k , @xmath32  k between 10 and 20  k , @xmath33  k between 20 and 30  k , @xmath34  k between 30 and 40  k , and @xmath35  k above 40  k.    additional uncertainty enters via our choice of @xmath28 : a clump with t@xmath36 = 15  k for @xmath37 would have t@xmath36 = 11  k for @xmath38 and t@xmath36 = 21  k for @xmath39 .",
    "the equivalent uncertainty range for a clump with t@xmath36 = 30  k would be @xmath21690  k. for these reasons , all of the temperatures above @xmath230  k should be considered highly uncertain , indicating only that a core is probably `` hot '' . despite the uncertainties in their absolute values ,",
    "the estimated temperatures still offer a means to rank the clumps by temperature .",
    "one possible exception would be cases where two clumps having different temperatures lie within the same jcmt beam ; we can not rule out such occurrences . to facilitate visualization of the distribution of clump temperatures , the clump symbols in figure  [ fig : m17850map ]",
    "are color - coded according to temperature .      assuming that the dust emission is optically thin , the integrated dust continuum flux of a clump can be converted to a total clump mass via :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the total gas and dust mass of the clump , @xmath42 is the flux at wavelength @xmath43 integrated over the clump boundary defined by _",
    ", @xmath44 is the distance to the clump ( taken to be 1.6  kpc ) , @xmath45 is the dust opacity per unit mass column density at wavelength @xmath43 , and @xmath46 is the planck function evaluated at temperature t@xmath47 . assuming , as previously , a spatially invariant @xmath37 , a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and the @xcite prescription for the dust opacity , @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49  @xmath50  g@xmath15 and @xmath51  @xmath50  g@xmath15 .",
    "this is the same prescription used in paper  i to calculate the masses of the clumps in ngc  7538 , and very closely mirrors those typically used in similar studies of the dusty clumps in low - mass star - forming regions ( c.f .",

    "we adopt two separate approaches to the remaining parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : clumpmass ] , the dust temperature . as a baseline approach",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that all clumps are isothermal and characterized by a mean dust temperature of @xmath230  k. this is consistent with the dust temperature of @xmath52  k found by @xcite using multi - wavelength pronaos dust continuum observations of m17n .",
    "the masses calculated under this assumption range from 0.8 to 120  @xmath6 for the 850  @xmath1 m  clumps , and from 1.8 to 160  @xmath6 for the 450  @xmath1 m  clumps .",

    "the total mass of the clumps detected at 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  are 2900 and 2000  @xmath6 , respectively . in the 98 cases where we were able to estimate the mean dust temperature of each 850  @xmath1 m  clump individually",
    ", we have used these temperatures to produce another estimate of their masses .",
    "the clump masses so calculated range from 0.3 to 200  @xmath6 , with a median value of 32  @xmath6 .",
    "clump masses calculated in both of these ways are given in tables  [ tab : m17850clumps ] and [ tab : m17450clumps ] .",
    "the masses calculated from the 850  @xmath1 m  fluxes are likely more accurate than those calculated from the 450  @xmath1 m  fluxes , as the latter suffer from lower signal - to - noise and larger error beam corrections .    like the temperatures , the masses are also affected by the choice of @xmath28 .",
    "a @xmath28 value of 2.0 would give 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  masses which were 0.54 and 0.75 times the stated values , respectively .",
    "for @xmath39 , the 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  masses would be 1.4 and 1.2 times higher , respectively .",
    "note , however , that a change in the assumed constant value of @xmath28 does not change the shape of the clump mass function .      to assess the likely evolutionary states of the clumps in our map , we searched for spatial correlations between clumps and tracers of massive star formation , such as outflows , masers , and compact infrared sources .",
    "the mapped region of m17 does not appear to have been surveyed for outflow sources .",

    "we would expect clumps which have an embedded mid - infrared source to be among the hotter clumps , but this is only true in 2 of the 16 cases ( clump smm  51 in the center - north and smm  98 in the southeast ) .",
    "interestingly , 11 of the 16 clumps with coincident msx point sources have estimated temperatures less than 20  k. one possible interpretation is that these are cold clumps which have recently formed a hot , compact object .",
    "another possibility is that the flux ratio ceases to be a good measure of clump temperature in the presence of an embedded infrared source . in some cases , the alignment of an msx source with a clump probably coincidental .",

    "the masses of these clumps range from 1.13 to 100 @xmath6 , indicating that they may become low , intermediate , or high - mass stars . while it is certainly possible that deeper infrared observations may reveal the presence of embedded sources within any of these clumps ( see , for example , @xcite ) , these cold , apparently starless clumps represent the best candidates for massive pre - stellar cores in m17 .",
    "by examining the relationship between the masses and radii of the m17 clumps , we may estimate the degree to which the sample is incomplete and determine something about the clumps sources of support against collapse .",
    "because the majority of the clumps in our map are at least minimally resolved , the detection threshold must be expressed as a limiting surface brightness , not as a limiting integrated flux or an equivalent clump mass .",
    "when the detection threshold is a limiting surface brightness , the clump sample may be incomplete to varying degrees at all masses : even a very massive clump may escape detection if its flux is spread sufficiently thinly . the complex interaction between the limiting surface brightness and the actual , but unknown , distribution of clump masses",
    "makes it difficult to constrain the effects of incompleteness in submillimeter continuum clump studies .",
    "the mass - radius plot helps to visualize the problem . in figure",
    "[ fig : m17_mvsr ] , we plot the mass of each clump versus its deconvolved effective radius . for both the 850  @xmath1 m   ( upper panel ) and 450  @xmath1 m  ( lower panel ) clumps , we use the masses calculated assuming a uniform clump temperature of 30  k and plot only the clumps with no coincident infrared source .",
    "we used these mass - radius plots to test whether the clump sample is essentially 100% complete above the plotted detection threshold or whether the degree of completeness decreases as we approach the threshold from above .",
    "the test consists of comparing the number of clumps extracted from a less sensitive version of our map to the number we would expect to extract based on the corresponding detection threshold drawn on figure  [ fig : m17_mvsr ] .",
    "we made an 850  @xmath1 m  map using one fifth of the total integration time .",
    "drawing a corresponding detection threshold on the top panel of figure  [ fig : m17_mvsr ] ( not shown ) , we find that we expect to lose 13 clumps in the less sensitive map .",
    "after processing the less sensitive map in the same way as the original map , we find that we lose 16 clumps .",
    "thus , we conclude that the clump sample is close to complete above the detection threshold .",
    "this suggests that , apart from potential sources of incompleteness such as chopping , the data are probably close to complete above the detection threshold .",
    "how should we interpret the distribution of clumps in the mass - radius plot ?",
    "if the clumps were an ensemble of critical bonnor - ebert spheres ( i.e. thermally supported , pressure - bounded , self - gravitating , and on the verge of collapse ) , we would expect their mass - radius relationship to be well - fit by a power law of the form @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "studies of the mass - radius relationship of submillimeter clumps in low - mass star - forming regions such as @xmath12  oph and orion b have found good agreement with the @xmath55 power law @xcite .",
    "similarly , if the clumps were an ensemble of critical , non - thermally supported spheres , such the logatropic spheres of @xcite , then they ought to obey a relationship more like @xmath56 . in paper  i , we found that the 850  @xmath1 m  clumps in ngc  7538 were best fit by a power law , @xmath57 , with exponent @xmath58 , suggesting that they are primarily turbulently supported .",
    "both of these results are somewhat surprising because , taken at face value , they imply an implausible scenario in which most of the clumps hover somewhere near criticality",
    ".    in the present work , refinements to our fitting technique require a more complex interpretation of the m17 clump mass - radius relationship .",
    "if we fit the mass - radius relationship of all of the clumps , taking no account of their radius uncertainties and making no distinction between resolved and unresolved clumps , we find results similar to those found in ngc  7538 ( paper  i ) : the 850  @xmath1 m  and 450  @xmath1 m  mass - radius relationships have exponents of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . however , if we exclude all those clumps with deconvolved radii smaller than the beam radius ( those to the left of the vertical dashed line in fig .

    "the steepness of the 850  @xmath1 m   mass - radius relationship in m17 is surprising , though it depends sensitively on the precision with which we can measure the radii of the smallest clumps . in principle",
    ", the 450  @xmath1 m  data , with twice the linear resolution of the 850  @xmath1 m  data , should produce a more reliable value of the exponent , @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath63 value of @xmath64 is much closer to those obtained in similar studies of low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether those studies also accounted for the potentially significant radius uncertainties and therefore whether their results are comparable with ours .",
    "further uncertainties may arise due to incompleteness and unresolved substructure in some clumps .",
    "neither effect can be reliably accounted for at present .",
    "assuming that the value @xmath65 from the 450  @xmath1 m  mass - radius relationship is correct , it indicates that the clumps are intermediate between constant surface density ( @xmath66 ) and constant volume density ( @xmath67 ) , and that they are non - thermally supported .",
    "astrophysical mass functions are commonly constructed in two ways : differential ( @xmath68 ) , in which the data are binned by mass , and cumulative ( @xmath69 ) , in which the data are not binned .",
    "we consider both forms , as each has unique merits .",
    "the binning process inherent in the differential mass function ( dmf ) naturally averages out errors and enables straightforward accounting of uncertainties , but the relatively arbitrary assignment of bin widths and centers introduces bias and can obscure physically significant features of the mass function .",
    "the cumulative mass function ( cmf ) does not average out errors , but it also does not lose information to binning , an effect which has been found problematic in studies of the stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "lack of binning makes the treatment of uncertainties somewhat more complicated in the case of the cmf . in the limit of very many objects ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the differential mass function might be preferable .",
    "however , studies of the clump mass function are typically in the relatively small @xmath71 regime , where neither form of the mass function should be considered definitive and careful consideration of both forms is warranted .    we have constructed both forms of the mass function for the m17 clumps detected in each waveband .",
    "figure  [ fig : m17dmfs ] shows the differential mass function of the m17 clumps at 850 and 450  @xmath1 m . to minimize uncertainties caused by the choice of bin width",

    "the differential version of the core mass function is typically fit using a double power law of the form :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and a normalization factor may all be fitted parameters . for the cumulative form of the mass function",
    ", the double power law fit takes the form :    @xmath76    where the symbols have the same meanings as in equation  [ eq : dmfeq ] . in both forms ,",

    "poisson error bars are not suitable for fitting the cmf , however , because it is not binned .",
    "instead , we used a monte carlo technique to compute the best fit parameters , their uncertainties , and a measure of the goodness - of - fit . for each data set , we generate @xmath78 synthetic data sets by randomly varying the mass of each clump within a gaussian probability envelope whose mean and standard deviation are equal to the observed clump mass and its random uncertainty , respectively .",
    "each of the @xmath78 synthetic data sets is then fit using the levenberg - marquardt nonlinear least - squares algorithm . to compute approximate weights used in the calculation and minimization of @xmath79 , we begin by noting that , to a good approximation , the observed random mass errors scale as @xmath80 . if we approximate the cmf by a power law @xmath81 , then we find the following by partial differentiation :    @xmath82    thus",
    ", we take the statistical weight of each point in the mass function to be @xmath83 , which accords with our intuition that clumps of higher masses ( lower @xmath71 in the cmf ) should be more heavily weighted . using this technique",
    ", we fit each of the @xmath78 synthetic data sets , plot histograms of the best fit parameters , and report the peak of each parameter distribution as the best fit to the observed mass function .",

    "both forms of the 450  @xmath1 m  mass function are well fit over most of their mass range by two power laws with a break at @xmath84 .",
    "the 850  @xmath1 m  dmf is also well fit by two power laws with a slightly lower break mass ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the 850  @xmath1 m  cmf , however , is not very well fit by a double power law , as evidenced by the bimodal parameter distribution which results when we attempt a double power law fit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m17_bfph ] ) .",
    "the higher of the two peaks in each parameter distribution represent the best fit to a double power law with a break mass at roughly the same position as the break found in the 450  @xmath1 m  mass function ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the lower peak demonstrates that a third power law with a steeper slope at masses above @xmath86 is required to produce a good fit",
    ". a mass function might be well fit by two power laws because it is incomplete at low masses or because there is a real physical break in the distribution of clump masses .",
    "however , that a a power law fit in three segments is required to produce a good fit suggests that the power laws are merely approximating an unknown continuous distribution .",
    "we consider this possibility next .    as will be discussed more extensively in paper  iii",

    "the galactic field star imf can be fit by a lognormal mass distribution ( @xcite , but see @xcite for a dissenting view ) , as can the mass function of pre - stellar clumps obtained from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",

    "the cumulative distribution function of @xmath79 values from our monte carlo simulations of the data allow us to determine the probability , @xmath91 , of obtaining by chance fits as poor as our best fits .",
    "the @xmath91 value for each fit is shown in figure  [ fig : m17cmfs ] , where @xmath92 . in all cases ,",
    "both power law and lognormal mass distributions generate acceptable fits ( @xmath93 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as suggested above , the continuous lognormal distribution provides a better fit to the 850  @xmath1 m  cmf than does the double power law .",
    "conversely , the double power law provides a better fit to the 450  @xmath1 m  cmf than the lognormal distribution , though both fits are good .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that both the lognormal distribution and the double power law are viable functional forms for the mass function of the pre - stellar clumps in m17 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lognormal distribution produces a good fit to the cmfs using only 2 parameters ( mean mass and width ) , whereas the double power law requires 4 parameters ( two exponents , a break point , and a normalization ) to produce fits of comparable quality .",
    "does the quality of the lognormal fits reflect the true distribution of the clump masses , or is it merely coincidence that an intrinsically power - law mass function is reasonably well fit by a lognormal distribution ?",
    "experimentation with synthetic data sets quickly reveals that , given sufficient freedom in selecting values of @xmath94 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , it is possible to generate an intrinsically double power law mass distribution whose cmf is significantly better fit by a lognormal distribution than by a double power law .",
    "however , the range of parameters for which this is the case are not necessarily reflective of those which characterize real star - forming regions .",
    "we would like to determine , in the specific case of m17 , the probability that a double power law mass distribution with plausible parameters might appear better fit by a lognormal distribution . to assess this probability",
    ", we generated @xmath78 synthetic 850 and 450  @xmath1 m   clump mass functions with exactly the mass distributions of our best fit double power laws .",
    "the cmf of each synthetic data set was fit with both a double power law and a lognormal distribution .",
    "we find that the residuals for the lognormal fit exceed those of the double power law fit in 90% of the trials with the synthetic 850  @xmath1 m  cmfs and 82% of the trials with the 450  @xmath1 m  cmfs .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that the good quality of our lognormal fits reflects a misrepresentation of an intrinsically double power law mass function in m17 .",
    "paper  iii will include a more comprehensive discussion of the uncertainties inherent in determining the functional form of the clump mass function .",
    "another interpretation of the lognormal fits to the m17 clump mass function is that severe incompleteness at their low - mass ends distorts what would otherwise be a single power law distribution .",
    "incompleteness would produce a mass function with a shallow low - mass end , potentially causing the lognormal distribution to produce the best fit .",
    "however , given that the instruments , data reduction techniques , and analytical methods are very similar in our studies of high - mass star - forming regions and previous studies of low - mass regions , we believe that incompleteness should affect all of the measured mass functions similarly .",
    "comparison of the mass - radius plots in our figure  [ fig : m17_mvsr ] with figure 4 of @xcite shows that , in both cases , the distribution of clumps adheres closely to the detection threshold , suggesting that both studies should be similarly affected by incompleteness .",
    "if the clump mass function in low - mass star - forming regions were severely incomplete at the low - mass end , it would spoil good the agreement between the clump and stellar mass functions ( see  [ sec : compstellar ] ) .",
    "the corrected clump mass function would then show a considerable overabundance of pre - stellar clumps below @xmath95 compared to the number of low - mass stars in the imf .",
    "thus , we have no reason to believe that incompleteness should dramatically alter the shape of the clump mass function in low - mass star - forming regions , nor that incompleteness has widely disparate effects on studies of low- and high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "hence , we can not conclude that the quality of the lognormal fits is due to incompleteness .",
    "the mass function of m17 may indeed have a lognormal shape with a peak above @xmath96 .",
    "studies of co clumps in star - forming regions have typically found mass functions which obey shallower power laws than those of submillimeter continuum clumps spanning the same mass range @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we compared the power law exponents of both co and submillimeter continuum mass functions and found them to be genuinely discrepant .",
    "the evidence from m17 further supports this conclusion .",
    "@xcite found that the mean power - law exponent of the differential mass functions of co clumps in 7 star - forming regions whose clumps span @xmath97@xmath98 is @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite found that the dmf of co clumps in the m17sw region , which adjoins but does not overlap the region we mapped , is well fit over the mass range by a single power law with exponent @xmath100 . in m17 , where the mass function of submillimeter continuum clumps spans a compatible range of @xmath101@xmath102 , we find a mean power law exponent of @xmath103 .",
    "again , the submillimeter continuum and co mass functions appear to disagree . in paper",
    "iii , we will present an analysis of the functional form of the submillimeter continuum mass function which suggests that it is not well fit by a single power law , as the co mass functions clearly are .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between the co and submillimeter continuum mass functions is not yet clear . to help resolve this nagging issue , it would be illuminating to compare the mass functions of objects extracted from co and submillimeter continuum maps of identical regions , at comparable spatial resolutions , using the same clump extraction technique . for the moment ,",
    "the issue remains unresolved .",
    "the masses of the m17 clumps span the high - mass end of the stellar mass range .",
    "the masses computed assuming a constant dust temperature range from 0.8 to 160  @xmath6 , although only a few clumps have masses @xmath104  @xmath6 .",
    "their deconvolved radii span the range  pc , or .",
    "although the large distance to m17 makes it difficult to match the linear resolution and mass sensitivity of similar studies of low - mass star - forming regions , there is significant overlap .",
    "for example , in their study of the dust continuum clumps in the orion b complex , @xcite found clumps with masses and radii in the ranges  @xmath6 and , respectively .",
    "the properties of our clumps also overlap , to differing extents , with those found in the submillimeter continuum studies of @xmath12  oph @xcite , the lagoon nebula @xcite , and ngc  7538 ( paper",
    "i ) , among others . based on their masses , sizes , and estimated temperatures",
    ", it is reasonable to suggest that some fraction of the `` clumps '' in m17 are in fact star - forming `` cores '' which may be the direct precursors of individual stars or small multiple systems .",
    "thus , as has been done in studies of the clump mass function in low - mass star - forming regions , it is reasonable to compare the m17 clump mass function to the mass function of stars in young clusters . ideally ,",
    "because we do not know how many stars may form in any given clump , we would compare our clump mass function to the imf of stellar _",
    "systems _ in young clusters .",
    "the imf of stellar systems differs from the imf of individual stars by corrections for unresolved binaries and higher order multiples . in practice , because these corrections are difficult to determine accurately , many published `` stellar '' imfs include unresolved systems @xcite .",
    "the exact form of the stellar mass function in young clusters is not yet well established , particularly for cluster ages @xmath105  yr @xcite .",
    "the present - day mass function of young cluster stars can be represented by a lognormal distribution below @xmath106  @xmath6 and a power law above , though whether there may be multiple power law segments at higher masses is not clear .",
    "( the imf of galactic field stars , for example , is well fit by three power law segments above @xmath96 ; @xcite . )",
    "where a single high - mass power law is assumed , its exponent is found to be roughly equal to the salpeter value , i.e. @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath74 for the stellar mass function of young clusters exhibit substantial variation , ranging at least between -1.5 and -3 .",
    "@xcite have suggested that , because most measured @xmath74 values are approximately normally distributed around -2.3 , the spread may be due to ordinary measurement variation .",
    "however , other authors favor a steeper value for @xmath74 , perhaps closer to -3 , for massive stars @xcite .",
    "studies of the pre - stellar core mass function in low - mass star - forming regions have shown peak masses ( @xmath108 ) and power law exponents for @xmath109  @xmath6 which agree well with those found in the young cluster stellar imf @xcite .",
    "this agreement between the core mass function and the stellar imf has been widely interpreted as suggesting that the cores are the immediate precursors of stars , and that the core mass function will translate smoothly into a similarly - shaped stellar imf .",
    "our four measures of @xmath74 for the m17 clumps have much the same characteristics as measures of @xmath74 for the stellar imf . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : m17params ] , the @xmath110 values range between -1.5 and -3.0 , with a mean of -2.3@xmath1110.4 , consistent with the salpeter value . as with measures of @xmath110 for the stellar imf ,",
    "variations among the measures of @xmath110 for the m17 clump mass function are likely attributable to ordinary measurement variation .",
    "in particular , the uncertain placement of the break between the two power laws can strongly influence the derived power law exponents . even though we find a mean power - law exponent which agrees with the salpeter value",
    ", this does not necessarily mean that the m17 clump mass function is well - represented by a single power law at high masses .",
    "indeed , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : m17mffit ] , the high - mass end of the 850  @xmath1 m  cmf is best fit by 2 separate power law segments .",
    "thus , the apparent agreement with the salpeter power law may be misleading : in particular , our good lognormal fits suggest that the structure of the clump mass function is probably somewhat more complicated than this agreement would suggest .",
    "the mass function of high - mass stars in young clusters is typically assumed to have a power law form , so lognormal fits to it are scarce .",
    "the imf of galactic field stars is presumed lognormal below @xmath112 , with a peak near 0.1  @xmath6 , but it may also be well fit by a lognormal distribution at masses above 1  @xmath6 ( @xcite , although see @xcite ) . as mentioned above , studies of the clump mass function in low - mass star - forming regions have typically found that it peaks well below @xmath96 , at several 0.1  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the range of clump masses probed by these studies typically ranges from a few 0.01  @xmath6 to as much as 30  @xmath6 .",

    "the fitted peak masses , shown in table  [ tab : m17params ] , range from 2 to 5.7  @xmath6 with a mean of @xmath113 , while the clump masses themselves span the range @xmath21150  @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the m17 mass function is not simply the extension to higher masses of the clump mass function seen in low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by our finding that the clump mass functions in both m17 and ngc  7538 ( paper",
    "i ) are clearly best fit by more than one power law above 1  @xmath6 .",
    "the position of the peak mass in each clump mass function is affected by incompleteness , though the extent of this effect is difficult to assess .",
    "furthermore , the differing assumptions made in each study about the clump temperatures and dust emissivities affect the derived value of the peak clump mass .",
    "subject to these caveats , we suggest that the clump mass function in high - mass star - forming regions may be a _ scaled - up _ version of the low - mass clump mass function .",
    "the two may have a common form ( perhaps lognormal ) but different intrinsic scales , as characterized by their differing peak masses .",

    "the estimated dust temperatures range from 6 to 235  k , with a mean of 33  k and a median of 20  k. as in paper  i , we find a correlation between high spectral index and high submillimeter continuum flux .",

    "we suggest that these are the best candidates for very young massive pre - protostellar cores in the mapped portion of m17 .",
    "we have produced both differential ( @xmath68 ) and cumulative ( @xmath69 ) mass functions for the `` starless '' clumps detected in each waveband .",
    "we fit each mass function with both a segmented power law and a lognormal distribution .",

    "a lognormal mass function would be consistent with the view of high - mass star formation as an inherently clustered , and therefore highly stochastic phenomenon ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mean peak mass of the fitted lognormal distributions is @xmath121 , which assumes a dust emissivity of @xmath28 = 1.5 and a mean dust temperature of @xmath122  k. this mass is substantially higher than the peak mass obtained from fits to the stellar imf and low - mass clump mass function , which is typically a few tenths of a solar mass .",
    "we suggest that the clump mass function in massive star - forming regions may be a scaled - up version of the mass function seen in low - mass star - forming regions , such as @xmath12  oph and orion b. the general shape of the mass functions appears to be similar , but their intrinsic scales , represented by their peak masses ( for example ) , differ significantly .",

    "<S> we show that a lognormal clump mass distribution with a peak at @xmath24@xmath5 produces as good a fit to the clump mass function as does a double power law . </S>",
    "<S> this 4@xmath5 peak mass is well above the peak masses of both the stellar initial mass function and the mass function of clumps in low - mass star - forming regions . despite the difference in intrinsic mass scale , </S>",
    "<S> the _ shape _ of the m17 clump mass function appears to be consistent with the shape of the core mass function in low - mass star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we suggest that the clump mass function in high - mass star - forming regions may be a scaled - up version of that in low - mass regions , instead of its extension to higher masses . </S>"
