    "has several implications for the theory .",
    "for instance , the authors use a variational principle in which a variation is added to the motion of only one constituent .",
    "however it is necessary to add to the variations of kinetic and potential energies a virtual work due to the forces not represented by a potential .",
    "such forces are difficult to take into account in a variational principle deduced from the one by hamilton .",

    "+ the mixture is represented by several distinct continuous media that occupy the same physical space at time _ t_. the novelty consists in the fact that the used variational principle is applied to a lagrangian representation associated with a reference space for each component .",
    "the proposed method uses the knowledge of the internal energy of the mixture at every point of the physical space .",
    "this is not the case in [ b & d ] .",
    "+ for classical fluids , the method corresponds to hamilton s principle in which one makes a variation of the reference position of the particle .",

    "+ for mixtures , the principle appears far more convenient than the method of only taking the variation of the average motion into consideration : it separately tests each component and leads to a thermodynamic form of the equation of motion for each of them .",
    "+ the internal energy is assumed to be a function of different densities or concentrations of the mixture .",
    "because of the form of the principle we use , one must consider an entropy for each component in the mixture .",
