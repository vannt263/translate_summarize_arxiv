    "the complex multi - orbital microscopic description of iron pnictides is qualitatively well established by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite . the fermi surface , with two nearly circular hole pockets around @xmath5 @xmath6 and elliptical electron pockets each around x @xmath7 and y @xmath8 points in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state , is mainly composed of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 fe orbitals @xcite .",
    "the two hole pockets involve mixing between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals , while the electron pockets are composed of @xmath14 and @xmath15 orbitals .",

    "this may account for the narrow nematic phase @xcite above the nel temperature where ferro orbital order @xcite and structural distortion survive , as well as the temperature dependence of the measured anisotropies in @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions of magnetic excitations and resistivity @xcite .    in view of above results , three orbital tight binding models involving the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 fe @xmath21 orbitals",
