    "the fciqmc method@xcite is a stochastic algorithm that has enabled calculation of the ground state energy of the largest molecules to date@xcite to fci accuracy , i.e. exact given a fixed basis set .",
    "it has also found success calculating the ground state energy of model hamiltonians such as the uniform electron gas@xcite and the three band hubbard model@xcite , as well as solid state systems.@xcite recent developments mean that properties beyond the ground state energy , such as forces@xcite and excited state energies@xcite can also be calculated .",
    "further , efficient stochastic implementations of other methods such as second order mller plesset perturbation theory ( mp2)@xcite , density functional theory ( dft)@xcite and coupled cluster theory@xcite have been developed , forming a new field of stochastic computational chemistry .",
    "these monte carlo methods differ from the more traditional diffusion monte carlo method @xcite , which requires the use of a fixed node approximation to prevent collapse of the wavefunction to a bosonic state .",
    "the eventual hope is that these methods will allow the properties and reactivity of large molecules to be investigated to unprecedented accuracy .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations are plagued by the fermion sign problem : the quantity being sampled can be either positive or negative which may cause the calculation to converge to the wrong answer.@xcite in fciqmc the sign problem appears as the critical population of particles required to correctly sample the ground state wavefunction.@xcite whilst the scaling of this with system size has been investigated in a number of systems@xcite , the effect of it on the stochastic error has not been well studied .",
    "the ( systematically improvable ) initiator approximation@xcite can reduce the critical population by many orders of magnitude",
    ". however , the impact of this key advance on the stochastic error has similarly not been thoroughly investigated .",
    "the efficiency of a stochastic algorithm can be measured by computational cost ( cpu time and memory requirements ) necessary for convergence to a given stochastic error .",
    "the fciqmc algorithm is not a ` black box ' method and the manner in which sampling is performed can impact the computational resources used whilst performing a calculation and the resultant statistical error bar .",
    "we believe that understanding the efficiency of a fciqmc calculation is important for two main reasons .",
    "firstly so that one can use a computational budget as effectively as possible , ideally leading to the ability to perform fciqmc calculations automatically and efficiently without careful tuning of input parameters .",
    "secondly it helps compare the effectiveness of different algorithms based upon and additional approximations to fciqmc .",
    "previous studies of the efficiency of fciqmc investigated the standard error as a function of computer time and focused on comparing very different algorithms.@xcite here we take a different tack , running many empirical calculations to understand how the stochastic sampling of the wavefunction affects the error bar for fciqmc in general .",
    "once we understand this effect , we form a metric which is independent of the parameter choices and use it to measure how the error bar scales with system size .",
    "we begin with an overview of the fciqmc method .",
    "we then explore the dependence of the statistical error bar on the total population and the timestep in [ eff_error_bar ] and on the system size , both basis set and number of electrons , in [ cost - fciqmc ] .",
    "finally , we discuss in [ conclusions ] how the total number of particles ( relative to the plateau height ) affects the stochastic error bar and draw some conclusions about how to choose parameters to maximise the efficiency of the fciqmc algorithm ` a priori ' from the plateau height .",
    "the fciqmc algorithm@xcite can be viewed as a stochastic power method . on every iteration",
    "the representation of the wavefunction , @xmath0 , at imaginary time @xmath1 is updated by sampling the action of the operator : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian , @xmath4 is an offset used to control normalisation , and @xmath5 is the timestep .",
    "as long as @xmath6 has a non - zero overlap with it , the ground state will be all that remains once @xmath1 is large enough , assuming @xmath7 is sufficiently small@xcite and @xmath4 is carefully controlled .",
    "@xmath8 is represented by a number of ( signed ) unit weights located on @xmath9 ; we call a single unit a psi - particle or psip.@xcite other choices of discretisation are possible@xcite ; for the purposes of this work we consider the simplest case .",
    "[ projector ] is sampled in three stages to make up a single timestep of @xmath5@xcite :    spawning : :    each psip ( with weight @xmath10 ) attempts to spawn a child    psip on a randomly selected @xmath11 with probability    @xmath12 , where    @xmath13 is the probability that @xmath11    is selected given the parent psip is on @xmath9 and    with sign    @xmath14 .",
    "death : :    each psip dies ( is removed from the simulation ) with probability    @xmath15 , where    @xmath16 , if    @xmath17 ; for @xmath18 , instead , a copy of the    psip is made with probability @xmath19 .",
    "annihilation : :    psips on the same determinant with opposite signs cancel .",
    "initially @xmath4 is set to the hartree  fock energy , which is larger ( less negative ) than the fci energy and this causes the population @xmath20 ( total number of psips ) to begin to grow exponentially .",
    "if there is a sign problem @xmath20 will plateau as the sign structure is projected out .",
    "it is only after this point that @xmath0 becomes a stochastic representation of the wavefunction and @xmath20 grows exponentially again.@xcite to counter this exponential growth @xmath4 is periodically adjusted every @xmath21 timesteps according to : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial value of the shift , @xmath24 is the population at the end of the equilibration phase and @xmath25 , the damping factor , is usually fixed during a simulation .",
    "in addition to the shift , the energy of the system can be estimated via the projected estimator , which typically has a smaller statistical noise : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ( signed ) number of psips on determinant @xmath28 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 represents the time average .",
    "the initiator approximation@xcite can dramatically reduce the sign problem in fciqmc .",
    "@xcite in initiator fciqmc ( ifciqmc ) , previously unoccupied determinants can only be spawned onto from determinants with a population above a certain threshold ; a threshold of @xmath31 is typical and used throughout this paper .",
    "the initiator approximation introduces a systematic error in the sampling of [ projector ] , which is evident in both estimates of the energy , with unbiased sampling restored in the limit of an infinite population of psips .",
    "a monotonic convergence to the fci energy as a function of @xmath32 has been observed for many simple systems,@xcite though this is not universally the case .",
    "in this paper we study the following systems :    1 .",
    "an isolated neon atom in the following dunning basis sets@xcite : cc - pvdz , aug - cc - pvdz , cc - pvtz , aug - cc - pvtz , cc - pvqz , aug - cc - pvqz .",
    "2 .   the hydrogen fluoride , hf , molecule in a cc - pvdz basis at bond lengths of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , the hartree  fock equilibrium bond length in this basis .",
    "chains of between 2 and 7 helium atoms at intervals of @xmath31 in a 6 - 31 g basis set.@xcite 4 .   chains of between 5 and 7 helium atoms at intervals of @xmath31 in a 6 - 31 g basis set with localised molecular orbitals .",
    "we used pipek ",
    "mezey localisation @xcite to localise the occupied hartree ",
    "fock molecular orbitals .",
    "hartree  fock calculations were performed using q - chem@xcite , with local modifications to obtain the required integrals .",
    "fciqmc calculations were performed and analysed using hande@xcite and figures plotted using matplotlib.@xcite unless otherwise stated , atomic units are used throughout .",
    "raw and analysed data and analysis scripts are availale at ref .  .",
    "if the hamiltonian does nt have a ` sign problem ' in fciqmc , it is impossible for psips of opposite signs to be generated on the same determinant and so annihilation can not occur . in this case",
    "each psip samples the wavefunction independently from each other and hence the error in the estimate of the energy , @xmath37 , must behave as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant of proportionality and @xmath40 is the number of timesteps from which @xmath37 is estimated .",
    "[ decay ] arises because the contribution to the estimate of @xmath41 from each psip can be combined in a similar way to the contribution for running from multiple timesteps .",
    "increasing @xmath5 simply increases the probability of spawning / death and so decreases @xmath37 in the same way as increasing @xmath40 or @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath39 can be estimated from a fciqmc calculation using @xmath37 estimated by blocking analysis of the projected energy and @xmath42 .",
    "for consistency throughout this paper , we use an automatic approach to calculate the optimal block length@xcite , which has previously been applied to dmc@xcite and is implemented in pyblock.@xcite    for systems with a ` sign problem ' , which is the usual case , @xmath39 will depend on @xmath42 and @xmath5 . we will call",
    "@xmath43 the inefficiency and note from [ decay ] that a smaller @xmath39 implies a more efficient calculation . in secs .",

    "this behaviour has been seen in a wide range of systems , which are included in the supplemental information.@xcite owing to the sign problem , only after the population reaches the plateau does the vector of psips become a stochastic representation of the eigenvector.@xcite populations below the plateau could either have a divergent @xmath37 or an incorrect average correlation energy with a finite @xmath37 ; we see the former behaviour . for populations greater than the plateau",
    ", @xmath39 decays as a function of @xmath42 and tends to a finite constant in the large population limit .",
    "if the initiator approximation is used , then we find that @xmath39 is a constant as a function of @xmath42 for populations much smaller than the plateau and , for a fixed @xmath5 , the same as @xmath39 in fciqmc in the large @xmath42 limit .",
    "we call this limit on @xmath39 the ifciqmc limit . for example in [ pop_dynamics - np ] inefficiency in fciqmc does nt hit the ifciqmc limit until about @xmath49 , approximately @xmath31 times the plateau height .",
    "this is an important point : if the largest population affordable in fciqmc is not sufficient to reach the ifciqmc limit ( but is sufficient to exceed the plateau ) , then the initiator approximation is still useful as it provides a significant reduction in the stochastic error for the same computational cost .",
    "it may , however , be difficult to quantify if the introduction of an initiator error is a price worth paying for a potentially significant reduction in statistical error bar .",
    "this behaviour has implications about how best to run parallel fciqmc and ifciqmc simulations given a fixed amount of computational resources .    in the canonical parallel fciqmc implementation@xcite the hilbert space",
    "is partitioned over the processors , resulting in efficient distribution of the memory demands across the processors .",
    "psips spawned from a parent determinant in one part of the hilbert space onto a child determinant in another part of the space are communicated between processors .",
    "it is this communication overhead that limits the parallel scalability of fciqmc .",
    "the simplest way to parallelise a monte - carlo algorithm is to run independent calculations and combine statistics gathered in each calculation .",
    "the overall stochastic error scales as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of independent calculations .",
    "therefore once the population is such that @xmath39 reaches the ifciqmc limit , it is more efficient to use multiple independent simulations to minimise interprocess communication .",
    "@xmath39 is approximately constant for a sufficiently small timestep , @xmath5 , and otherwise @xmath39 increases with @xmath5 ; the value of @xmath5 after which @xmath39 is non - constant is system dependent .",
    "we have seen this behaviour for all systems investigated in this paper ( see supplemental information@xcite ) and for fciqmc and ifciqmc .",
    "[ pop_dynamics - tau ] shows this for an isolated neon atom in cc - pvdz and aug - cc - pvdz bases .",
    "a previous investigation @xcite has shown that the plateau height exhibits a similar behaviour to @xmath39 as a function of @xmath5 in fciqmc calculations .",
    "as shown in [ pop_dynamics - tau ] for the ne atom ( and in the supplemental information@xcite for other systems ) the plateau height appears to be a good metric for when @xmath39 remains constant as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "this is useful as the plateau height is easier and cheaper to measure than statistical accumulation of the energy and hence evaluation of @xmath39 .",
    "we denote the largest @xmath5 such that @xmath39 is constant as @xmath52 .    in the supplemental information@xcite we investigate whether @xmath42 has an impact on @xmath52 and find this is not the case .",
    "we do however find that @xmath39 increases faster as a function of @xmath5 when @xmath53 for a small @xmath42 than a large @xmath42 and hence the most efficient timestep has an implicit dependency on @xmath42 .",
    "the population dynamics can become unstable if the @xmath5 is set large enough such that the exponential growth can not be countered by population control .",
    "we find that the point at which the population explodes is beyond @xmath52 for the systems studied here with the exception of ne cc - pvdz ( see [ pop_dynamics - tau ] left ) which does nt have a noticeable plateau .",
    "top right we found that the population explodes when @xmath5 is slightly greater than 0.05 for ne cc - pvdz . ]",
    "in the previous sections we investigated both the scaling of the inefficiency , @xmath39 , as a function of ( mean ) population , @xmath42 , and timestep , @xmath5 .",
    "following this , we can define a metric that lets us investigate the scaling of the error bar as we change system .",
    "the simplest such metric is to find the minimum value of @xmath39 , @xmath54 , i.e. when it is a constant as a function of @xmath42 and @xmath5 .",
    "this requires calculations with @xmath55 and either the initiator approximation ( with the initiator error converged ) or a large @xmath42 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath56 as a function of hilbert space size is shown in [ a - scales ] for all systems studied in this work : the neon atom , hydrogen fluoride at different bond lengths and chains of helium atoms in the canonical and localised basis sets .",
    "we see a sublinear relationship between the scaling of @xmath56 with size of hilbert space for the same chemical species and a significant impact when the degree of strong correlation is increased .     as a function of system size .",
    "[ system - list ] describes the systems studied in more detail .",
    "@xmath56 was calculated by fitting @xmath39 for ifciqmc calculations with differing populations with the exception of ne cc - pvdz , he2 , he3 and he4 , which have no noticeable plateau , where many fciqmc calculations were used .",
    "the timestep was set to be sufficiently small such that @xmath39 is constant .",
    "the supplemental information@xcite shows the studies used to find @xmath56 for each system . ]",
    "fciqmc is very efficient at finding the ground state of the neon atom : @xmath57 , the ratio of plateau height to hilbert space size , is @xmath58.@xcite the size of the hilbert space scales factorially with the basis set yet there is a sublinear scaling of the stochastic error with the hilbert space size .",
    "in contrast @xmath57 scales superlinearly for chains of helium atoms separated by @xmath31  in the canonical hartree ",
    "fock basis : for he@xmath59 @xmath60 whereas for he@xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "however , @xmath56 again seems to scale sublinearly with the size of the hilbert space .",
    "the similar behaviour , within statistical error bars , of @xmath56 for ne atom and helium chains suggests sublinear scaling of the stochastic error in fciqmc with hilbert space size for weakly correlated systems with no strong dependence on the fciqmc sign problem . in a similar style",
    "study in dmc@xcite , nemec et al . investigated computational scaling as a function of the number of hydrogen atoms at a large separation , finding that the computer time required to achieve a fixed error bar scales exponentially as the square root of the system size .",
    "as the hilbert space size scales loosely exponentially with the system size , we see this trend is similar , though with such few systems studied it seems premature to generalize this trend .",
    "localisation of the molecular oribitals breaks symmetry and so increases the size of the accessible hilbert space .",
    "however we find in this case that the plateau height decreases ; for example localisation causes the plateau for he@xmath61 to decrease from @xmath63 ( @xmath62 ) to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "importantly localisation also appears to decrease @xmath56 compared to using the canonical orbitals , especially for he@xmath61 , though it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from three data points with non - negligible standard errors .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath56 is not solely governed by the size of the hilbert space , however . stretching hydrogen fluoride in a fixed basis set ( and hence hilbert space )",
    "causes the correlation energy to increase .",
    "we find that @xmath56 increases significantly with bond length but have not found a simple linear scaling with the correlation energy or plateau height . given this behaviour",
    "does nt fit with the weakly correlated systems studied above , investigation of the scaling of the error bar in fciqmc in the strongly correlated limit would be an interesting topic for future investigation .",
    "we have defined a metric , _ inefficiency _ , for measuring the stochastic efficiency of fciqmc calculations and investigated its behaviour as a function of the parameters controlling the population dynamics and as a function of system size .",
    "we have found that a sizeable reduction in the stochastic error is possible by increasing the population of psips and using the largest possible timestep such that the plateau height remains constant .",
    "the optimal timestep is transferable between fciqmc and ifciqmc simulations",
    ". the efficiency decreases ( and inefficiency increases ) sublinearly with the size of the hilbert space in weakly correlated systems .",
    "the population required to exceed the plateau height or converge the initiator approximation becomes a limiting factor much faster than the rise in the stochastic error bar for a given computational effort .",
    "this suggests that if improved approximations which reduce the sign problem can be made , then the stochastic noise will not be insurmountable when treating yet larger systems .",
    "this analysis ignores the impact of population and timestep on the computational cost of the calculation , which is detailed in .",
    "ideally we would like to set the population and timestep such that the stochastic error decays as fast as possible as a function of the computational effort .",
    "this analysis does nt change the guidelines given above :    the population should be large enough such that the inefficiency metric , @xmath39 , is converged to the ifciqmc limit ;    the largest timestep for which the plateau remains constant represents a lower bound on the most efficient timestep and is difficult to improve upon without running lots of expensive calculations at different timesteps .",
    "orbital localisation was found to be effective for reducing the plateau height , and thus the cost of a fciqmc calculation for chains of helium atoms , as well improving the stochastic efficiency .",
    "consequently , it may be worthwhile investigating fciqmc algorithms tuned to localised orbitals .    more broadly",
    ", we have provided a framework for assessing the statistical efficiency of fciqmc and related methods .",

    "all calculations were run on a single core of an intel core i7 - 2600 processor . ]",
    "an efficient fciqmc implementation uses a sparse storage scheme to store the list of psips : a representation of a determinant along with the number of psips occupying the determinant are stored together.@xcite the expensive steps are evolving the psips ( spawning and death ) and annihilation ( combining psips on the same determinant ) .    the cost of spawning and death is linear in the population ; the death step can be efficiently performed on a per - determinant rather than per - psip basis but the effect of this can absorbed into a system - dependent prefactor .",
    "the prefactor also includes the cost of selecting a random excitation and calculating the necessary hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "the cost of annihilation depends on the number of psips created in a single timestep . assuming the calculation has equilibrated at a population in excess of the critical population , the number of psips created scales linearly with the population and the timestep with a rate dependent on the average absolute value of the off - diagonal elements in the hamiltonian matrix . whilst annihilation can be performed with a linear scaling@xcite ,",
    "the implementation in hande currently uses a binary search approach that introduces a logarithmic dependency on the number of occupied determinants . for the purposes of this analysis , we shall neglect the logarithmic dependency and instead focus on the optimal case .    under these assumptions",
