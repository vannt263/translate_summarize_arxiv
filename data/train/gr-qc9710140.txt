    "the physical processes occurring during the last orbits of a neutron - star binary are currently a subject of intense interest @xcite-@xcite . in part , this recent surge in interest stems from relativistic numerical hydrodynamic simulations in which it has been noted @xcite that as the stars approach each other their interior density increases . indeed , for an appropriate equation of state , our numerical simulations indicate that binary neutron stars collapse individually toward black holes many seconds prior to merger",
    ". this compression effect would have a significant impact on the anticipated gravity - wave signal from merging neutron stars .",
    "it could also provide an energy source for cosmological gamma - ray bursts @xcite .    in view of the unexpected nature of this neutron star compression effect and its possible repercussions , as well as the extreme complexity of strong field general relativistic hydrodynamics ,",
    "it is of course imperative that there be an independent confirmation of the existence of neutron star compression before one can be convinced of its operation in binary systems . in view of this",
    "it is of concern that the initial numerical results reported in @xcite have been called into question .",
    "a number of recent papers @xcite have not observed this effect in newtonian tidal forces @xcite , first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) dynamics @xcite , tidal expansions @xcite , or in binaries in which rigid corotation has been imposed @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to point out that none of these recent studies could or should have observed the compression effect which we observe in our calculations .    moreover",
    ", this flurry of activity has caused some confusion as to the physics to which we attribute the effects observed in the numerical calculations .",
    "the present paper , therefore , summarizes our derivation of the physics which drives the collapse .",
    "we illustrate how such terms have been absent in some newtonian or post - newtonian approximations to the dynamics of the binary system .",
    "we also present numerical results and analytic expressions which demonstrate how the compression forces result in an orbiting dynamical system from the presence of fluid motion with respect to the corotating frame . as such",
    ", they could not appear in an an analysis of relativistic external tidal forces no matter how many orders are included in the tidal expansion parameter ( e.g.  @xcite ) unless self gravity from internal hydrodynamic motion is explicitly accounted for .",
    "the effect could also not arise in systems with uniform translation or rigid corotation .",
    "the implication of the present study is that any attempt to confirm or deny the compression driving force requires an unconstrained , untruncated relativistic hydrodynamic treatment . at present , ours is still the only existing such calculation .",
    "hence , despite claims to the contrary @xcite , the neutron star compression effect has not yet been independently tested .",
    "another confusing aspect surrounding the numerical results has been our choice of a conformally flat spatial three - metric for the solution of the field equations .",
    "indeed , it has been speculated that this approximate gauge choice ( in which the gravitational radiation is not explicitly manifest ) may have somehow led to spurious results .",
    "a second purpose of this paper , therefore , is to emphasize that the compression driving terms are a completely general result from the relativistic hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
    "the advantages of the conformally flat condition are that the algebraic form of the compression driving terms is easier to identify and that the solutions to the field equations obtain a simple form",
    ". it does not appear to be the case , however , that the imposition of a conformally flat metric drives the compression .",
    "it has been nicely demonstrated in the work of baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite that conformal flatness does not necessarily lead to neutron - star compression .",
    "there has been some confusion in the literature as to the uncertainties introduced by imposing a conformally flat condition ( henceforth _ cfc _ ) on the spatial three - metric .",
    "therefore we summarize here some attempts which we and others have made to quantify the nature of this approximation .    the only existing strong field numerical relativistic hydrodynamics results in three unrestricted spatial dimensions to date",
    "have been derived in the context of the _ cfc _ as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the usual adm ( 3 + 1 ) metric @xcite in which there is a slicing of the spacetime into a one - parameter family of three - dimensional hypersurfaces separated by differential displacements in a timelike coordinate , @xmath0 where we take latin indices to run over spatial coordinates and greek indices to run over four coordinates .",
    "we also utilize geometrized units ( @xmath1 ) unless otherwise noted .",
    "the scalar @xmath2 is called the lapse function , @xmath3 is the shift vector , and @xmath4 is the spatial three metric .    in",
    "what follows , we make use of the general relation between the determinant of the four metric @xmath5 and the adm metric coefficients @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the conformally flat metric condition simply expresses the three metric of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) as a position dependent conformal factor @xmath8 times a flat - space kronecker delta @xmath9    it is common practice ( e.g.  @xcite ) to impose this condition when solving the initial value problem in numerical relativity .",
    "it is the natural choice for our three - dimensional quasiequilibrium orbit calculations @xcite which in essence seek to identify a sequence of initial data configurations for neutron - star binaries .",
    "the reason conformal flatness is chosen most frequently for the initial value problem is that it simplifies the solution of the hydrodynamics and field equations .",
    "the six independent components of the three metric are reduced to a single position dependent conformal factor .",
    "since conformal flatness implies no transverse traceless part of @xmath4 it can minimize the amount of initial gravitational radiation apparent in the initial configuration .",
    "however , in general the physical data still contain a small amount of preexisting gravitational radiation .",
    "this has been clearly demonstrated in numerical calculations of axisymmetric black - hole collisions @xcite . in exact numerical simulations",
    ", the gravitational radiation appears as the time derivatives of the spatial three metric ( @xmath10 ) and its conjugate ( the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 ) are evolved .",
    "the immediate evolution of the fields from conformally flat initial data is characterized by the development of a weak gravity wave exiting the system .",
    "an estimate of the radiation content of initial data slices for axisymmetric black hole collisions has been made by abrahams @xcite . even for high values of momentum ,",
    "the initial slice radiation is always less than about 10% of the maximum possible radiation energy ( as estimated from the area theorem ) .",
    "two questions then are relevant to our application of the _",
    "cfc_. one is the validity of this metric choice for the initial value problem , and the other is the effect on the system of the `` hidden '' gravitational radiation in the physical data .",
    "regarding the validity of the _ cfc _ one has a great deal of freedom in choosing coordinates and initial conditions as long as the initial space is riemannian and the metric coefficients satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have shown in @xcite that exact solutions for the _ cfc _ metric coefficients can be obtained by imposing the adm hamiltonian and momentum constraint conditions .",
    "nevertheless , in three dimensions a physical space is conformally flat if and only if the cotton - york tensor vanishes @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ricci tensor and @xmath14 is the ricci scalar for the three space .",
    "equation ( [ cy ] ) vanishes by fiat for the three - space metric we have chosen . however , conformally flat solutions for physical problems have only been proven @xcite for spaces of special symmetry ( e.g.  constant curvature , spherical symmetry , time symmetry , robertson - walker , etc .",
    "hence , the invocation of the cfc here and in other applications is an assumption . that is , it is a valid solution to the einstein constraint equations , but does not necessarily describe a physical configuration to which two neutron stars will evolve .",
    "nevertheless , this is a valid approximation as long as the nonconformal contributions from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 equations in the exact two - neutron star problem remain small .",
    "indeed , numerical tests for an axisymmetric rotating neutron star @xcite and a comparison of the _ cfc _ vs.  an exact metric expansion for an equal - mass binary @xcite have indicated that conformal flatness is a good approximation when it can be tested .    as a related illustration ,",
    "consider the kerr solution for a rotating black hole .",
    "it is well known that the kerr metric is not conformally flat .",
    "the close binaries we study have specific angular momentum only slightly greater than that of an extreme kerr black hole . also , they ultimately merge and collapse to a single kerr black hole .",
    "hence , an analysis of the cotton - york tensor for a kerr black hole is another indicator of the degree to which conformal flatness is a valid approximation for neutron - star binaries .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] . gives the dimensionless scaled cotton - york parameter @xmath15 for a maximally rotating kerr black hole as a function of proper distance .",
    "for illustration , consider the decrease of this quantity as one moves away from the horizon at @xmath16 as a measure of the rate at which the metric becomes conformally flat .",
    "the maximally rotating ( @xmath17 ) black hole of this example , however , is an extreme example of compactness and angular velocity relative to any of the neutron stars in our simulations .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] that , even for this extreme case , the dimensionless tensor coefficient @xmath15 diminishes rapidly away from the black hole . at the separation of interest for binary neutron stars approaching their final orbits ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total binary mass and @xmath20 the separation between stars ) ,",
    "this coefficient has already diminished to @xmath21 of the value at the event horizon , ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , the effect of either star on its companion is probably well approximated by conformal flatness .",
    "regarding the interior of the neutron stars themselves , in our studies the stars are rotating so slowly ( even when corotating ) that the deviation from conformal flatness is probably negligible .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that conformal flatness is a reasonable approximation for most physical aspects involving the spatial three - metric of binary neutron - star systems .",
    "the next issue concerns the `` hidden '' radiation in the physical data . to address this",
    "we decompose the extrinsic curvature into longitudinal @xmath23 and transverse @xmath24 components as proposed by york @xcite , @xmath25 by definition the transverse part obeys @xmath26 where @xmath27 are covariant derivatives . the longitudinal part can be derived from a properly symmetrized vector potential .",
    "we find @xmath28 where @xmath29 are spatial components of the contravariant four - momentum density .",
    "the product @xmath30 is a measure of the hidden radiation energy density . to find @xmath24",
    "then from our numerical calculations , we first find @xmath31 by choosing maximal slicing [ @xmath32 and requiring that the trace free part of the @xmath10 equation vanish .",
    "this gives @xcite @xmath33 we then determine @xmath23 from the equilibrium momentum density [ eq .  ( [ kl ] ) ] and subtract @xmath23 from @xmath34 .",
    "we find that this measure of the `` hidden '' gravitational radiation energy density is a small fraction of the total gravitational mass energy of the system , @xmath35 hence , we conclude that the cfc is probably a good approximation to the initial data",
    ".    this should be an excellent approximation for the determination of stellar structure and stability .",
    "however , an unknown uncertainty enters if one attempts to reconstruct the time evolution of the system ( e.g.  the gravitational waveform ) from this sequence of quasistatic initial conditions . at present",
    "we make this connection approximately via a multipole expansion @xcite for the gravitational radiation as described in @xcite .",
    "the meaning of imposing a conformally flat spatial metric can , perhaps , be qualitatively understood in an electromagnetic analogy .",
    "both the adm formulation of relativity and maxwell s equations can be written as two constraint equations plus two dynamical equations . in electromagnetism",
    "the constraint equations for electric and magnetic fields are embodied in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 equations , while the dynamical equations are contained in ampere s law and faradays law . in relativity",
    "the analogous constraint equations are the adm momentum and hamiltonian constraints .",
    "the dynamical equations are the adm @xmath11 and @xmath10 equations .",
    "in either electromagnetism or gravity , any field configuration which satisfies the constraint equations alone represents a valid initial value solution .",
    "however , one must analyze its physical meaning .",
    "for example , consider two orbiting charges .",
    "one could construct an electric field which satisfies the constraint by simply summing over the electrostatic field from two point charges .",
    "similarly , one can construct a static magnetic field from the charge current by imposing @xmath38 in the dynamical equations .",
    "however , by forcing the dynamical equations to vanish , one has precluded the existence of electromagnetic radiation . in this field configuration , therefore one has unknowingly imposed ingoing radiation to cancel the outgoing electromagnetic waves .    similarly , enforcing @xmath11 = @xmath39 might in part",
    "be thought of as implying the existence of ingoing gravitational radiation to cancel the outgoing gravity waves .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases , this remains a good approximation to the physical system ( with no ingoing wave ) as long as the energy density contained in the radiation is small compared to the energy in orbital motion .",
    "gravity waves enter in two ways : as estimated above there is an insignificant amount of `` hidden '' radiation induced by our choice of the cfc ; there is also the emission of gravitational radiation by the orbiting binary system .",
    "the binary gravity - wave emission is estimated in our calculations by evaluating the multipole moments and using the appropriate formulas @xcite .",
    "the fractional energy and angular momentum loss rate as determined by the multipole expansion method is quite small , e.g.  @xmath40 in all of our calculations @xcite .",
    "hence , it can be concluded that the energy in gravitational radiation is indeed small compared to the energy in orbital motion .",
    "the emission of gravity waves also induces a reaction force which we have incorporated into our hydrodynamic equations by the quadrupole formula .",
    "the radiation reaction force is so small , however , that it is difficult to discern it in the numerical results . in most of our calculations",
    "we simply neglect the back reaction terms and thereby obtain quasistatic orbit solutions .      with a conformally flat metric , the constraint equations for the field variables @xmath41 , @xmath2 , and @xmath42",
    "reduce to simple poisson - like equations in flat space .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint equation @xcite for the conformal factor @xmath41 becomes @xcite , @xmath43~. \\label{phieq}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the inertial mass - energy density @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the local proper baryon density which is simply related to the baryon number density @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath50 the atomic mass unit , and @xmath51 is avogadro s number .",
    "@xmath52 denotes the internal energy per unit mass of the fluid , and @xmath53 is the pressure . in analogy with special relativity",
    "we have also introduced a lorentz - like variable @xmath54^{1/2 } \\equiv   \\alpha u^t   & = & \\biggl [ 1 + u^j u_j \\biggr]^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\biggl [ 1 + \\gamma^{i j }   u_i u_j \\biggr]^{1/2}~~ , \\label{weq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the spatial part of the covariant four velocity . here",
    "we explicitly write @xmath56 ( in place of @xmath57 used in @xcite ) because it emphasizes the extra velocity dependence here and in the equations of motion .    in the newtonian limit , the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) is dominated @xcite by the proper matter density @xmath46 , but in relativistic neutron stars there are also contributions from the internal energy density @xmath52 , pressure @xmath53 , and extrinsic curvature .",
    "this poisson source is also enhanced by the generalized curved - space lorentz factor @xmath58 .",
    "this velocity factor becomes important as the orbit decays deeper into the gravitational potential and the orbital kinetic energy of the binary increases .",
    "it was pointed out in the appendix of @xcite that in analogy to the velocity - dependent enhancement of the source for eq .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) , the poisson source for the @xmath59 post - newtonian correction to the effective potential also exhibits velocity - dependence .",
    "this appendix has been misinterpreted as a statement that we attribute the compression to a first post - newtonian effect .",
    "we therefore wish to state clearly that the appendix in that paper was merely an illustration of how the effective gravity begins to show velocity dependence even in a post - newtonian expansion .",
    "the velocity dependence of the post - newtonian source is not the main compression driving force .",
    "the compression derives mostly from the hydrodynamic terms described herein .",
    "it is not obvious , however , at what post - newtonian order the compression effect should be counted , since different authors have treated these terms differently .",
    "we return to this point below .    in a similar manner @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , together with the maximal slicing condition , provides an equation for the lapse function , @xmath60~~. \\label{alphaeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here again , the source is strengthened when the fluid is in motion through the presence of a @xmath61 factor and the @xmath62 term .",
    "the momentum constraints @xcite provide an elliptic equation @xcite for the shift vector , @xmath63 @xmath64 where we have introduced @xcite the lorentz contracted coordinate covariant momentum density , @xmath65    as noted previously and in ref .",
    "@xcite , we only solve equation ( [ wilson3 ] ) for the small residual frame drag after the dominant @xmath66 contribution to @xmath67 has been subtracted .",
    "the techniques of general relativistic hydrodynamics have been in place and well studied for over 25 years @xcite .",
    "the basic physical processes which induce compression can be traced to completely general terms in the hydrodynamic equations of motion . to illustrate this we first summarize the completely general derivation of the relativistic covariant momentum equation in eulerian form and identify the terms which we believe to be the dominant contributors to the relativistic compression effect .    for hydrodynamic simulations",
    "it is convenient to explicitly consider two different spatial velocity fields .",
    "one is @xmath55 , the spatial components of the covariant four velocity .",
    "the other is @xmath68 , the contravariant coordinate matter three velocity , which is related to the four velocity @xmath69 it is convenient to select the shift vector @xmath42 such that the coordinate three velocity vanishes when averaged over the star , @xmath70 .",
    "this minimizes coordinate fluid motion with respect to the shifting adm grid .",
    "the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor is @xmath71 however , it is convenient to derive the hydrodynamic equations of motion using the mixed form , @xmath72    the vanishing of the spatial components of the divergence of the energy momentum tensor @xmath73 leads to an evolution equation for the spatial components of the covariant four momentum , @xmath74 the covariant momentum equation is used because of its close similarity with newtonian hydrodynamics .",
    "the first two terms are advection terms familiar from newtonian fluid mechanics .",
    "the latter two terms are the pressure and gravitational forces , respectively .    expanding the gravitational acceleration into individual terms we have",
    "@xmath75    similar forms can be derived for the condition of baryon conservation and the evolution of internal energy @xcite . however , the above momentum equation is sufficient for the present discussion .",
    "it is now worthwhile to consider the  gravitational ",
    "forces embedded in the expanded terms of equation ( [ hydromom ] ) . these result from the affine connection terms @xmath76 in the covariant differentiation of @xmath77 .",
    "the term containing @xmath78 comes from the time - time component of the covariant derivative .",
    "it is of course the well known analog of the newtonian gravitational force as can easily be seen in the newtonian limit @xmath79 .",
    "the term @xmath80 comes from the space - time covariant derivative . in an orbiting system",
    "it is convenient to allow @xmath81 to follow the orbital motion of the stars . in our specific application",
    "@xcite we let @xmath82 where @xmath83 is chosen to minimize matter motion on the grid .",
    "hence , @xmath84 includes the major part of rotation plus frame drag .",
    "the quantity @xmath85 is the residual frame drag after subtraction of rotation and is very small for the almost nonrotating stars which result from our calculations . with @xmath81",
    "dominated by @xmath86 , the term @xmath80 is predominantly a centrifugal force .",
    "the @xmath87 term arises from the time - time component of the affine connection piece of the covariant derivative .",
    "the @xmath88 term similarly arises from the space - space components .",
    "they do not have a newtonian analog .",
    "as we shall see , these terms cancel when a frame can be chosen such that the whole fluid is at rest with respect to the observer ( or in the flat space limit ) .",
    "however , for a star with fluid motion in curved space , they describe additional velocity - dependent forces .",
    "we identify the nonvanishing combination of these @xmath56-dependent force terms and the @xmath80 term as the major contributors to the net compression driving force .",
    "this suggests some useful test problems for our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "for example , in simple uniform translation the effects of these terms must cancel to leave the stellar structure unchanged .",
    "similarly , as discussed below , any fluid motion such that the four velocity can be taken as proportional to a simple killing vector ( e.g.  rigid corotation ) these force terms must cancel @xcite .",
    "however , for more general states of motion , e.g.  noncorotating stars , differential rotation , meridional circulation , turbulent flow , etc . , these forces do not obviously cancel , but must be evaluated numerically .    indeed , as discussed below , the sign of these terms is such that a lower energy configuration for the stars than that of rigid corotation can be obtained by allowing the fluid to respond to these forces .",
    "as we shall see , the numerical relaxation of binary stars from corotation ( or any other initial spin configuration ) produces a nonsynchronous ( approximately irrotational ) state of almost no intrinsic neutron - star spin in which the central density and gravitational binding energy increase .",
    "the practical implementation of conformal flatness means that , given a distribution of mass and momentum on some manifold , we first solve the constraint equations of general relativity at each time for a given distribution of mass - energy .",
    "we then evolve the hydrodynamic equations to the next time step .",
    "thus , at each time slice we obtain a solution to the relativistic field equations and then can study the hydrodynamic response of the matter to these fields @xcite .    for the _ cfc _ metric , the relativistic momentum equation is derived by simply replacing @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) .",
    "@xmath90 here as in eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) , the first term with @xmath91 is the relativistic analog of the newtonian gravitational force .    in eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) there are two ways in which the effective gravitational force might increase for finite @xmath56 .",
    "one is that the matter contribution to the source densities for @xmath2 or @xmath41 are increased by factors of @xmath92 [ cf .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) and ( [ alphaeq ] ) ] . the more dominant effect , however , is from the combination of the @xmath93 term and the @xmath94 $ ] terms in eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) .    as noted previously , these compression driving terms result from the affine connection part @xmath76 of the covariant differentiation of @xmath77 .",
    "these terms have no newtonian analog but describe a general relativistic increase in the gravitational force as @xmath56 increases . as noted in @xcite ( see also fig [ fig2 ] below ) for a binary , @xmath56 is approximately uniform over the stars , and the increase in central density due to these additional forces scales as @xmath95 .",
    "this scaling , however , is the net result from a nontrivial cancellation of terms and must be treated carefully .",
    "we shall return to this point below .",
    "the proper way to determine the post - newtonian order at which the compression driving terms enter would be to count the powers of @xmath96 which appear in the denominator of a term .",
    "for example , if we divide the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) by the gradient of the @xmath2 term ( the analog of the newtonian gravitational force ) we would obtain a ratio of order @xmath97 which would be manifestly first post newtonian . however , in the first post - newtonian treatment of wiseman @xcite , these velocity terms were explicitly disregarded .",
    "thus , the effects of these terms could not have been present in that calculation .",
    "it is no surprise , therefore that no effect was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also note that the @xmath98 term in eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) enters with a sign such that the total @xmath56-dependent contribution is further increased by about twice that from the @xmath99 contribution alone .",
    "( the factor of 2 in front of the derivative comes from the requirement that @xmath100 in the newtonian limit @xcite . )",
    "a further increase of binding arises from the @xmath101 terms in the field sources , but these terms are much smaller than the @xmath56 contributions for a binary system .      for comparison with other work in the literature it is instructive to discuss the derivation of the relativistic bernoulli equation from equation ( [ hydromom ] ) .",
    "it has been pointed out ( e.g.  @xcite ) that the hydrodynamics reduces to a simple equation for a fluid in which the velocity field can be represented by a killing vector . in our notation",
    "this equation can be written , @xmath102    the demonstration that the relativistic bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) is exactly reproduced from eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) and indeed for any case in which a killing vector can be imposed , was recently brought to our attention by t. nakamura @xcite .",
    "we summarize the derivation here in the conformally flat metric both for clarity and to show that conformal flatness does not violate this important constraint .    to begin with , note that in the adm formalism , the existence of a killing vector is equivalent to being able to choose a shifted adm grid such that @xmath103 everywhere for the fluid .",
    "next use eq .",
    "( [ threevel ] ) to solve for @xmath42 and divide by @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting equation for stationary motion is @xmath104 the recovery of the relativistic bernoulli equation requires that the r.h.s .",
    "@xmath105 . with some straightforward algebraic manipulation it is possible to show that all of the terms on the r.h.s .",
    "cancel except for one term from the @xmath106 derivative , @xmath107 .",
    "the completion of the proof is simply to note that this term is equal to @xmath108 by eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) .",
    "the result is eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the change in the relativistic bernoulli equation when there is no killing vector , i.e.  @xmath109 . along the same lines of the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli1 ] ) , it can be shown @xcite that the momentum equation can be rewritten in our notation as , @xmath110   + u^t u_j { \\partial v^j \\over \\partial",

    "contains not only the advection terms ( in brackets ) , but also an additional surviving part of the @xmath81 derivative .",
    "it can be seen from this that imposing a killing vector ( @xmath103 ) means that only simple hydrostatic equilibrium is obtained for stationary systems . however , when nontrivial hydrodynamic motion is allowed , the extra forces embodied in the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ hydromomb ] ) are manifest .",
    "the presence of fluid motion not represented by a simple killing vector , thus leads to a deviation from the simple relativistic bernoulli solution .",
    "any attempt to model this deviation requires a careful treatment of the dynamical properties of the fluid described by the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ hydromomb ] ) .",
    "further insight into the complexity of the physics contained in the relativistic equations of motion can be gained by considering some simple examples of constrained hydrodynamics for which the answer is known .",
    "these pose useful tests of our numerical scheme . since some have proposed that the effect we observe may be an artifact of numerical resolution or approximation , we present here a summary of various test problems designed to illustrate the stability of the numerics and also to compare with some of the calculations in the literature .",
    "these calculations also demonstrate that the compression effect vanishes in the limiting cases which have been studied by others .",
    "hence , they could not have been observed .",
    "they highlight the fact that the effect we observe only appears in a strong field dynamic treatment which accounts for internal motion of stellar material in response to the binary and its effect on the star s self gravity . at present",
    ", ours may be the only existing result .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite based upon test particle dynamics .      to test for the presence of the compression driving forces we consider two bench - mark initial calculations .",
    "the bench mark of no compression is that of an isolated star . in our three dimensional hydrodynamic calculations ,",
    "the single star structure is derived from eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) in the limit @xmath111 the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium in isotropic coordinates is then trivially derived from eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) @xmath112 where the tilde denotes that the metric coefficients are evaluated in the fluid rest frame .",
    "the newtonian limit of the right hand side is recovered as @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we again identify the @xmath114 term with the relativistic analog of the newtonian gravitational force .",
    "( [ static ] ) also trivially reproduces to relativistic bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) .",
    "we have of course tested our three dimensional calculations for single isolated stars .",
    "a single star remains stable on the grid indefinitely , except when baryon mass exceeds the maximum stable mass allowed by the tov equations . above the maximum tov mass",

    "we have also checked that the grid resolution used in our binary calculations is adequate to produce the correct central density , stellar radius , and gravitational mass of a single isolated star @xcite .",
    "hence , it seems unlikely that inadequate grid resolution is the source of the compression effect as some have proposed .    in order to facilitate comparisons with the literature , and to avoid confusion over equation of state ( eos ) issues ,",
    "we have employed a simplistic @xmath115 polytropic eos , @xmath116 , where @xmath117 erg @xmath118 g@xmath119 .",
    "this gives a maximum neutron - star mass of 1.82 @xmath120 .",
    "the gravitational mass of a single @xmath121 @xmath120 star in isolation is 1.51 @xmath120 and the central density is @xmath122 g @xmath123 .",
    "the compaction ratio is @xmath124 , similar to one of the stars considered in @xcite .",
    "note that this eos leads to stars with a lower compaction ratio than the stars we considered in @xcite for which @xmath125 .",
    "hence , the effects of tidal forces in the present calculations should be more evident .",
    "the bench mark in which compression is present is that of two equal mass stars in a binary computed with unconstrained hydrodynamics .",

    "the binary stars have @xmath130 and are at a coordinate separation of @xmath131 km .",
    "the stars are stable but close to the collapse instability .",
    "hence , they have experienced some compression which has increased their central density by 14% up to @xmath132 g @xmath123 .",
    "the central densities of these two bench marks are summarized in the first and last entries of table [ table1 ] . to compare with these bench - mark calculations",
    "we have computed equilibrium configurations for stars under the various conditions outlined below .",
    "the test for the presence or absence of compression inducing forces will be the comparison of the numerically computed central density with that of a single isolated star or stars in a binary .",

    "choosing motion along the @xmath133 coordinate , the fluid three velocity is , @xmath134 however , the observer is still free to choose the adm shift vector such that the computational grid remains centered on the star .",

    "there is the shift vector derivative @xmath139 . even in uniform translation",
    "this derivative is nonzero due to the variations of the metric coefficients over the star ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ betadef ] )",
    ". also , the effective gravity is enhanced by the @xmath140 velocity factor .",
    "the @xmath141 term also appears .",
    "in addition , the effective source terms ( [ phieq ] ) and ( [ alphaeq ] ) for the _ cfc _ metric coefficients are enhanced both by @xmath140 factors and the @xmath142 term .    in spite of these differences , we nevertheless know that the locally determined pressure and inertial density must be the same as those determined for a star at rest . indeed , since we can choose a killing vector ( @xmath103 ) these equations must reduce to the relativistic bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) .",
    "thus , this is an important numerical test problem .",
    "we solve the full hydrodynamic equations explicitly , e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) , under the initial condition of nonzero @xmath143 for a single star .",
    "the cancellations embedded in the hydrodynamics are not obvious . nevertheless , in the end , all of these effects must cancel to leave the stellar central density unchanged ( except for a lorentz contraction factor ) .    to solve the uniform translation problem",
    "numerically we have applied the hamiltonian and momentum constraints to determine the metric coefficients .",
    "we then evolved the full hydrodynamic equations to equilibrium .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the numerically evaluated central density for such translating stars as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "these stars were calculated with the eos of @xcite .",
    "this is compared with the central density for binary stars evolved at the same @xmath56 value using the same eos .",
    "one can see that the translating stars maintain a constant central density ( within numerical error ) as they should .",
    "in contrast , the central density of binary stars grows as @xmath95 .",
    "this growth is the nontrivial net result from the velocity dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) .",
    "it is not obvious , however , to what post - newtonian order this dependence corresponds .",
    "as summarized in table [ table1 ] , the central density for a uniformly translating @xmath115 star with @xmath130 ( for comparison with the binary bench - mark calculation ) is @xmath144 g @xmath123 . within numerical accuracy ,",
    "this central density is identical with that of an isolated star at rest .",
    "this is at least indicative that our observed growth in central density may not be numerical error as some have suggested ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such an error would likely be apparent in this test case .",
    "we argue that the difference between simple translation and binary orbits relates to the physics of the binary system itself , in particular physics which is not apparent in uniform translation , an analysis of tidal forces , or a truncated expansion which does not contain sufficient terms to adequately describe the dynamical response of the fluid .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that tidal forces are in the opposite sense to the compression driving forces discussed here . that is , tidal forces distort the stars and decrease the central density and therefore render the stars less susceptible to collapse .",
    "we have argued @xcite that although such stabilizing forces are present in our calculations they are much smaller in magnitude than the velocity - dependent compression driving terms .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the matter fields in a calculation in which only tidal forces are present still represents a useful test of our numerical results .",
    "stars in which only tidal forces act , should be stable and the central density should decrease rather than increase as the stars approach .    to test the effects of tidal forces alone",
    "we have constructed an artificial test calculation in which we place stars on the grid in a binary , but with no initial angular or linear momentum , i.e.  @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this initial condition would normally evolve to an axisymmetric collision between the stars .",
    "however , after updating the matter fields , we artificially return the center of mass of the stars to the same fixed separation after each time step .",
    "we also reset to zero the mean velocity component directed along the line between centers .",
    "this sequence is repeated until the matter fields come to equilibrium . since the velocity dependent forces eventually vanish , the only remaining forces are the pressure and static gravitational ( including tidal ) forces .    results as a function of separation distance",
    "are shown in table [ table2 ] for the @xmath115 eos and table [ table3 ] for the realistic eos used in @xcite .",
    "for the realistic eos the central density indeed decreases as the stars approach consistent with the expectations from newtonian and relativistic tidal analyses @xcite . for the @xmath115 polytropic eos",
    ", the central density also decreases as the stars approach and remain below the central density of an isolated star . the fact that this table is not monotonic at the innermost point",
    ", however , may be due to a limitation of this numerical approximation for tidal forces as the ratio of separation to neutron - star radius diminishes .",
    "although the tidal forces do indeed stabilize the stars , their effect on the central density is quite small ( @xmath147 decrease ) compared to the net increase in density caused by the compression forces present for the binary .",
    "this is consistent with the relative order - of - magnitude estimates for these effects described in @xcite .      as a next nontrivial example , consider stars in a binary system which are restricted to rigid corotation .",
    "in a recent series of papers , baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite have studied neutron - star binaries using the same conformally flat metric .",
    "their work differs from ours in that rather than solving the hydrodynamic equations , they describe the four velocity field by a killing vector whereby the stars are forced to corotate rigidly .",
    "they also impose spatial symmetry in the three cartesian coordinate planes so that they can solve the problem in only one octant .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that rigid corotation is not necessarily the lowest energy configuration or the most natural @xcite final state for two neutron stars near their final orbits .",
    "this assumption , though artificial , is nevertheless a means to constrain and simplify the fluid motion degrees of freedom .",
    "it is much easier to implement and therefore becomes an interesting test problem for codes seeking to explore the true hydrodynamic evolution of close binaries .",
    "indeed , it is possible to show @xcite that in this limit , the neutron star hydrostatic equilibrium can be described by a simple bernoulli equation in which the compression driving force terms are absent except for a weak velocity dependence .",
    "analytically , the reason for this is trivially obvious from eq .",
    "( [ hydromomb ] ) .",
    "the existence of a killing vector is equivalent to setting @xmath103 globally .",
    "choosing the adm coordinates to remain centered on the stars , in steady state the time derivatives vanish along with the rest of the l.h.s  of eq .",
    "( [ hydromomb ] ) . only the relativistic bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) survives .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore that in @xcite it has been demonstrated that in this special symmetry , the central density of the stars does not increase ( within numerical error ) as the stars approach the inner most stable circular orbit . in very close orbits",
    "the density actually decreases relative to the central density of stars at large separation .",
    "they also find that the orbit frequency remains close to the newtonian frequency .",
    "both of these results are interesting in that they confirm that the compression effect does not occur ( as it should not ) in this special symmetry .",
    "they also demonstrate that conformal flatness is not the source of the compression .    accepting the results of @xcite as correct ,",
    "this then becomes another important test of our calculations .",
    "that is , if we artificially impose rigid corotation , then the central density should remain nearly constant until the stars are close enough that tidal effects cause the central density to decrease rather than increase .    imposing rigid corotation",
    ", however , is not a trivial test problem to implement without completely replacing the hydrodynamic equations with the corresponding bernoulli solution of @xcite .",
    "( indeed , we have done this @xcite and reproduce the results of @xcite quite well ) .",
    "moreover , we have found that directly modifying the hydrodynamic equations in an attempt to mimic a dynamically unstable configuration is difficult .",
    "one might think that the simplest way to implement corotation would be to impose a high fluid viscosity .",
    "indeed high viscosity would resist the hydrodynamic forces described herein .",
    "however , a high fluid viscosity also resists the much weaker tidal forces and prevents the numerical relaxation to quasistatic equilibrium .",
    "it is thus difficult to achieve tidal locking by simply increasing the viscosity .    instead , we introduce artificial forces on the fluid which continually drive the system toward a state of rigid corotation while allowing the system to at least somewhat respond hydrodynamically . to do this",
    "we define accelerations @xmath148 necessary to achieve rigid rotation by @xmath149 where @xmath150 are components of the rigidly corotating covariant four velocity in the @xmath151 orbit plane .",
    "these are determined by requiring that @xmath152 and setting @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ threevel ] ) .",
    "@xmath153 @xmath154 where @xmath14 is the coordinate distance from the center of mass of the binary .    at each time",
    "step we then update the momentum density using a combination of the hydrodynamic and corotating acceleration terms , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the acceleration from the full hydrodynamic equation of motion [ eq .",
    "( [ hydromomcfa ] ) ] .",
    "numerically , we find that if @xmath157 is small ( @xmath158 ) the hydrodynamic forces dominate and corotation is not obtained . on the other hand , for @xmath159",
    "the system is not stable , i.e.  the stars deform and the velocities become erratic .",
    "we have therefore run with @xmath160 which temporarily produces a velocity field which is close to rigid corotation .",
    "that is , the residual three velocities are damped to a fraction of the orbit speed .",
    "this is , perhaps , good enough to make qualitative comparisons with the expectations from a truly corotating system .",
    "starting from the unconstrained initial configuration , we find that when the stars have achieved approximate corotation the central density has decreased from @xmath161 g @xmath123 to @xmath144 g @xmath123 which is close to the value for stars in isolation ( @xmath162 g @xmath123 ) .",
    "the calculated gravitational mass is slightly greater than that of the unconstrained binary .",
    "however , with the large artificial force terms needed to approximate corotation , gravitational mass is not a well defined quantity in this simulation .",
    "also , the orbit frequency was not sufficiently converged for a meaningful comparison .      as noted above our simulations",
    "indicate that neutron stars relax to a state of almost no intrinsic spin . in a separate paper @xcite",
    "we analyze the nature and formation of this state in more detail .",
    "for the present discussion , however , we summarize in figure [ fig3 ] a study of the relaxation to this state from states of arbitrary initial rigid rotation ( including corotation ) .    as a means to distinguish the intrinsic spin motion of the fluid with respect to a non - orbiting distant observer , we define a quantity which is analogous to volume averaged intrinsic stellar spin in the orbit plane , @xmath163   { \\phi^2 \\over \\alpha } d v_i~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is the coordinate center of mass of each star .    in this study",
    "we have imposed an initial angular velocity @xmath165 in the corotating frame to obtain various initial rigidly rotating spin angular momenta ( including corotation , @xmath166 ) , but for fixed total @xmath167 .",
    "we have considered spin angular frequencies in the range @xmath168 rad sec@xmath169 , corresponding to @xmath170 .",
    "we then let the system evolve hydrodynamically with the stars maintained at zero temperature .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that neutrino emission is sufficient to radiate away the released gravitational energy and keep the stars at near zero temperature until just before collapse .",
    "this is the reason that we have treated this as a relaxation problem .",
    "that is , unlike a true hydrodynamic calculation , the relaxation calculation presented here , assumes that the stars radiate efficiently and stay at zero temperature . therefore , this evolution does not need to conserve energy or circulation .",
    "this relaxation assumption is the reason the stars can evolve to a different spin ( lower energy ) state without violating the circulation theorem .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the spin @xmath171 as a function of time for each initial condition . in each case , the system relaxed to a state of almost no net spin within about three sound crossing times ( @xmath172 msec ) .",
    "these calculations suggest that rapidly spinning neutron stars in close orbits are unstable .",
    "the true evolution time , however , would be much longer .",
    "we also note that the quantity @xmath173 dv$ ] decreased as the system evolved from rigid rotation to hydrodynamic equilibrium .",
    "since this quantity is related to the kinetic energy of the binary , this indicates that the hydrodynamic lowest energy state is one of lower kinetic energy ( for fixed total angular momentum ) than that of rigid rotation .",
    "as far as the compression effect is concerned , one wishes to know whether the response of the stars is simply due to that fact that they have no spin ( and therefore no internal centrifugal force to support them against the compression forces ) , or whether more complex fluid motion within the star itself affects the stability . to test this",
    ", we have constructed stars of no spin ( @xmath174 ) by simply damping the residual motion to that of @xmath175 after each update of the velocity fields .",
    "since this no - spin state is so close to the true hydrodynamic equilibrium , this produced stable @xmath175 equilibrium stars for the binary .",
    "for this case , the central density converges to @xmath176 g @xmath123 which is very close to the high value for the unconstrained hydrodynamics .",
    "this result would seem to indicate that most of the increase in density can be attributed to the velocity with respect to the corotating frame generated by the fact that the stars have almost no spin .",
    "for clarity , we summarize in this section our conclusions regarding why the neutron - star compression effect was not observed in some other recent works .    first consider post - newtonian expansions . in the work of wiseman",
    "@xcite the force terms containing @xmath56 were explicitly deleted from the computation of the stellar structure [ cf .",
    "( 8) in that paper ] . only the @xmath177 term was included .",
    "the recovery of simple hydrostatic equilibrium was thus unavoidable .",
    "the pn orbiting ellipsoids of shibata et al .",
    "@xcite included more terms .",
    "indeed , it was noted that there are two effects at 1pn order .",
    "one is the self gravity of each star of the binary and the other is the gravity acting between the stars . in their calculations the self gravity dominates causing the stars to become more compact .",
    "this is consistent with the compression effect described here in the sense that relativistic corrections can dominate over newtonian tidal forces .",
    "however , the self gravity terms in @xcite appear to only include the usual 1pn terms which would equally apply to stars in isolation .",
    "hence , the velocity - dependent compression driving terms are probably not present .",
    "their results for stars in corotation are consistent with ours under the same constraint .",
    "they also note that approaches in which pn corrections to the gravity between the stars is included without also including the corrections to the self gravity ( as in @xcite ) can be misleading .    in the work of lombardi et al .",
    "@xcite both corotating and irrotational equilibria were computed . however",
    ", in their calculations it appears that the stars become less compact as they approach contrary to our results and the results of @xcite .",
    "it may be that the reason for this is that in lombardi et al .",
    "the post - newtonian corrections to self gravity were only computed for stars `` instantaneously at rest '' .",
    "the authors chose to `` exclude the spin kinetic energy contribution to the self energy '' .",
    "it is such terms , however , which we identify with the compression effect .",
    "the conformally flat corotating equilibria computed by baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite are consistent with our results .",
    "since their stars were restricted to rigid corotation , only the hydrostatic bernoulli solution would result .",
    "they could not have observed the compression forces which result from fluid motion with respect to the corotating frame .",
    "we have argued in this paper that if one wishes to explore this effect , it would be best to apply a complete unconstrained strong - field relativistic hydrodynamic treatment for stars which are not in corotation . in this regard , a recent paper @xcite has come to our attention in which hydrodynamic simulations of both corotating and irrotational binaries have been studied in a first post - newtonian approximation to conformally - flat gravity but using the full relativistic hydrodynamics equation ( [ hydromom ] ) .",
    "for both corotational and irrotational stars the central density is observed to oscillate about a value which is less than that of isolated stars .",
    "hence , the authors conclude that no compression effect is present .",
    "since this calculation contains many of the higher order terms to which we attribute the compression effect , it is not immediately obvious why the compression effect was not observed .",
    "this may indeed be a real contradiction .",
    "we suggest , however , that this simulation did not observe the effect because of their use of an unrealistically soft @xmath178 eos .",
    "the authors chose this eos because the stars become so extended that one can compute arbitrarily close binaries without encountering the relativistic inner orbit instability .",
    "for the irrotational stars ( model @xmath179 in @xcite ) , which is the only simulation that might have observed the compression effect , the compaction ratio is only @xmath180 .",
    "hence , a 1.45 m@xmath181 neutron star would have an unrealistic radius of 93 km .",
    "however , since they have simulated very extended stars at very close separation , the tidal forces are much stronger relative to the relativistic compression driving terms than in any of the simulations which we have done .",
    "the ratio of the stabilizing tidal correction @xmath182 to the destabilizing energy from compression @xmath183 should scale @xcite as @xmath184 where @xmath14 is the neutron star radius and @xmath20 is the orbital separation . for model bc in @xcite",
    "we estimate that this ratio is @xmath185 times greater than any of the binary stars we have considered .",
    "hence , it is quite likely that the authors have simply chosen an unrealisticly soft equation of state for which the tidal forces dominate over compression .",
    "it might be very interesting to see the results from a similar study for stars with a realistic compaction ratio and several radii apart .",
    "concerning tidal expansions , in brady & hughes @xcite an attempt was made to analyze the stability of a central star perturbed by an orbiting point particle .",
    "the metric and stress - energy were perturbed in terms of order @xmath186 where @xmath49 is the point particle mass and @xmath14 its coordinate distance from the central star .",
    "the einstein equation was then linearized to terms of order @xmath52 .",
    "the result of this linearization was that the only possible correction to the central density was a single monopole term of order @xmath187 .",
    "however , in our numerical results as shown in figure [ fig3 ] . the central density is observed to increase as @xmath59 .",
    "hence , it may be that the expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite was truncated at too low order to observe the compression effect described here .",
    "the main reason that they could not observe the effect , however , is that the terms involving motion of the central star were discarded .",
    "we attribute the compression effect to an enhancement of the self gravity due to motion of the stars with respect to the corotating frame .",
    "hence , the neglect of terms involving motion of the central star precludes the possibility of observing the effect .",
    "we believe that the same conclusion is true in the treatments by refs .",
    "the analysis of flanagan @xcite is based upon the method of matched asymptotic expansion .",
    "the metric is approximated @xmath188 where the superscript @xmath189 refers to the self contribution from one star and @xmath190 refers to the contribution from a distant companion .",
    "the internal gravity of a static neutron star @xmath191 is expanded to all orders .",
    "the binary tidal contribution @xmath192 is expanded in powers of the ratio of stellar radius to orbital separation .",
    "first we suggest that such a decomposition may be questionable for a close neutron - star binary . in our metric",
    "one can write the metric perturbation as @xmath193 the conformal factor @xmath41 is a solution to a poisson equation involving source terms from the two stars . between the stars , the only source of the fields arises from the @xmath142 terms which are quite small . hence , neglecting @xmath142 terms , @xmath41 is additive in the `` vacuum '' between the stars , @xmath194 expanding @xmath195 around star @xmath196 in the presence of a distant companion @xmath197 we have @xmath198 however , for the binary systems we have considered , the cross terms are @xmath199 15% to 20% of the sum @xmath200 .",
    "hence , they can not be neglected .",
    "the errors associated with this decomposition may be part of the reason that the compression effects are not apparent in this work .",
    "a related concern is with the expansion of the stress - energy tensor in @xcite .",
    "we have noted that most of the compression arises from the net effect of velocity dependent terms in the covariant derivative of the stress - energy tensor . in @xcite",
    "the stress energy is expanded is powers of the curvature @xmath201 .",
    "the author states @xcite `` we assume initial conditions of vanishing @xmath202 , so that the only source for perturbations is the external tidal field . ''",
    "an analysis which only considers perturbations from the external tidal field ( and not motions of the fluid ) will not observe the compression effect .",
    "the result of @xcite is that the central density is unchanged until tidal forces enter at @xmath203 .",
    "this is consistent with our results in the limit of only tidal perturbations acting on the stars . it is not clearto us , however , to what degree the velocity dependent terms",
    "are included or excluded by this expansion . a more careful recent revision ( e. flanagan , priv .",
    "comm . ) shows an effect coming in a lower order , but not necessarily as strong as we have noted .    in the paper of thorne @xcite",
    ", a similar tidal expansion is applied . in that work",
    "only the stabilizing effect of tidal forces was considered along with the stabilizing effect of rotation .",
    "however , the increased self gravity from velocity - dependent forces was not included .",
    "hence , the conclusions of @xcite are consistent with our results based upon tidal forces .",
    "so are the newtonian tidal effects computed in @xcite .",
    "the results of this study ( cf .",
    "table [ table1 ] ) are that we see almost no difference between the central density of an isolated star and a binary star in which rigid corotation has been artificially imposed , or one in which only tidal effects are included .",
    "indeed , in the case of tidal forces alone , the central density in our simulations actually decreases as stars approach , consistent with other works .",
    "an increase in the central density is only apparent in our binary simulations for stars with fluid motion with respect to the corotating frame .",
    "( specifically we considered stars of low intrinsic spin in a binary . ) in such cases there is no simple killing vector which can be imposed to cancel the compression driving forces .",
    "we have argued here and in @xcite that the main compression effect arises from the net result of velocity - dependent hydrodynamic terms @xcite .",
    "these terms arise from the affine connection part of the covariant differentiation of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "we show here that the compression effect would not have been observed in a study of tidal forces or any model which artificially imposes rigid corotation of the fluid",
    ". a proper treatment must consider all of the force terms apparent in the momentum equation ( [ hydromom ] ) to sufficient order that their effects on the fluid self gravity survive .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in @xcite based on test particle dynamics near a schwarzschild black hole . in that work",
    "it is concluded that at least 2.5 post - newtonian particle dynamics is necessary before a dynamical collapse instability is manifest .",
    "we argue that the results of this study are thus consistent with results in a number of recent papers @xcite which have analyzed the stability of binary stars in various approximations and limits and see no effect .",
    "since we do not disagree with the lack of a compression effect in the limits which they have imposed , we conclude that the existence or absence of the neutron - star compression effect has not yet been independently tested",
    ".    therefore , if one wishes to explore this effect , it would be best to apply a complete unconstrained strong - field relativistic hydrodynamic treatment employing an eos which produces realistically compact neutron stars .",
    "another alternative , however , might be to study the quasi - equilibrium structure of nonspinning irrotational binary stars at sufficiently high order . in this regard",
    "a recently proposed formalism @xcite to compute quasi - equilibria for nonsynchronous binaries may be of some use .",
    "we have begun calculations in this independent formalism .",
    "the results will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "regarding the existence of this low spin state , we find that such a state represents the unconstrained hydrodynamic equilibrium for a close binary .",
    "in newtonian theory , stars are driven to corotation by tidal forces .",
    "however in @xcite it has been shown that newtonian tidal forces are insufficient to produce corotation before neutron - star merger unless the viscosity is unrealistically high . nevertheless , in the absence of strong tidal forces , neutron stars stars gradually spin down .",
    "therefore , even apart from the hydrodynamic effects described here , stars of low spin are likely to be members of close binaries . the hydrodynamic effects described herein , however , could hasten the spin down as stars approach their final orbits and cause the stars to become more compact .",

    "<S> we discuss the underlying relativistic physics which causes neutron stars to compress and collapse in close binary systems as has recently been observed in numerical ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that compression is driven by velocity - dependent relativistic hydrodynamic terms which increase the self gravity of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> they also produce fluid motion with respect to the corotating frame of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical and analytic results which confirm that such terms are insignificant for uniform translation or when the hydrodynamics is constrained to rigid corotation . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the hydrodynamics is unconstrained , the neutron star fluid relaxes to a compressed nonsynchronized state of almost no net intrinsic spin with respect to a distant observer . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that tidal decompression effects are much less than the velocity - dependent compression terms . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss why several recent attempts to analyze this effect with constrained hydrodynamics or an analysis of tidal forces do not observe compression . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that an independent test of this must include unconstrained relativistic hydrodynamics to sufficiently high order that all relevant velocity - dependent terms and their possible cancellations are included . </S>"
