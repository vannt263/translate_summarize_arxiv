    "did see a rapid rise in the correlation length for @xmath42-wave pairing with decreasing temperature for densities @xmath196 , with the largest correlations around @xmath197 .",
    "a similar calculation by puttika and luchini  @xcite also gave a broad , growing peak in the low - temperature @xmath42-wave correlation length , but with the maximum shifted to smaller dopings around @xmath198 .",
    "thus the fact that we see the @xmath2 phase emerge near these densities for any non - zero interplanar coupling in the anisotropic @xmath1 model , fits with prevailing evidence for an instability toward @xmath42-wave superconductivity away from half - filling in the two - dimensional system .",
    "the above analysis leads to a basic question : how do results for a strongly anisotropic @xmath0 @xmath1 model compare to results obtained directly through a renormalization - group approach for the isotropic @xmath10 system ?",

    "the absence of any antiferromagnetic order is consistent with the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite .",
    "as seen above , at least a weak coupling in the @xmath8 direction is required for a finite nel temperature . what about the absence in @xmath10 of the @xmath2 phase ?",
    "it turns out that there is a pre - signature of the @xmath2 phase in @xmath10 , and it appears exactly where we find the actual phase upon adding the slightest interplane coupling .",

    "the disorder line , along which the trajectories eventually cross over from the @xmath2 region to disorder , is shown as dashed . ]",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 even with the weakest coupling between planes , in @xmath10 the @xmath2 phase sink is not a true sink fixed point of the recursion relations , but it is a `` quasisink '' in the sense that renormalization - group flows come close , stay in its vicinity for many iterations , before crossing over along the disorder line to one of the disordered sinks .",
    "we thus find a zero - temperature @xmath2 critical point ( which emerges from zero temperature with the slightest inclusion of interplanar coupling , leaving behind a true sink ) .",
    "the quasisink behavior is particularly true for trajectories initiating at low temperatures , where the quasisink that is reached is , numerically , essentially indistinguishable from a real one .",
    "since regions of the phase diagram that are approximately basins of attraction of the quasisink are characterized by a sharp rise in the number of iterations required to eventually reach the disordered sinks , we can extract useful information by counting these iterations .",
    "we choose a numerical cutoff for when the interaction constants in the rescaled hamiltonian have come sufficiently close to their limiting values at any of the high - temperature disordered fixed points ( the dilute disordered sink , the dense disordered sink , or the null fixed point in - between ) .",
    "we then count the number of iterations required to meet this cutoff condition for a given initial hamiltonian .",
    "[ anis_fig:5 ] shows the results as contour diagrams , plotted in terms of temperature vs. chemical potential and temperature vs. electron density .",
    "there are two clear regions in fig .",
    "[ anis_fig:5](a ) where the number of iterations blows up at low temperatures .",
    "the region for @xmath144 approximately between -0.5 and 1.6 flows to the @xmath2 phase quasisink . when expressed in terms of electron density in fig .",
    "[ anis_fig:5](b ) , this region is centered around a narrow range of densities near @xmath201 , which is where the @xmath2 phase actually emerges for finite @xmath160 .",
    "the low - temperature region for @xmath202 flows to an antiferromagnetic quasisink , but does not appear in the electron density contour diagram because the entire region is mapped to @xmath164 infinitesimally close to 1 .",
    "this is similar to what we see in the anisotropic model for low @xmath160 , where the antiferromagnetic region is stable to only very small hole doping away from @xmath148 , but gradually spreads to larger doping values as the interplane coupling is increased .",
    "[ anis_fig:6 ] shows the zero - temperature @xmath2 fixed point behavior in another way , by plotting the number of renormalization - group iterations as a function of temperature , for two different @xmath164 . for @xmath201 , in the @xmath2 phase range , the number of iterations diverges as temperature is decreased .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath203 , not in the @xmath2 phase range , the number is nearly constant at all temperatures . in summary",
    ", we see that the @xmath10 results are compatible with the small @xmath160 limit of the anisotropic model . a weak interplane coupling stabilizes both the @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic phases , yielding finite transition temperatures .",
    "is plotted as a function of hole concentration @xmath204 for the isotropic @xmath10 @xmath1 model , at four different temperatures . for comparison with experimental results ,",
    "the energy scale @xmath205 ev is chosen . with this scale ,",
    "the temperatures @xmath168 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 correspond to 23 , 70 , 116 , and 151 k respectively .",
    "experimental values for @xmath209 determined from x - ray photoemission spectra at @xmath210 k are shown for the cuprate la@xmath211sr@xmath212cuo@xmath213 ( lsco , filled circles )  @xcite and the nickelate la@xmath211sr@xmath212nio@xmath213 ( lsno , filled squares )  @xcite . for lsno we also show another experimental estimate based on ultraviolet photoemission spectra ( open squares ) , taken at 150 k , except for the datapoint at zero hole concentration , which was taken at 230 k  @xcite . ]",
    "we mentioned earlier that the lamellar structure of a and d phases which appears in the anisotropic @xmath1 phase diagram for hole dopings up to the @xmath2 phase might be an indicator of incommensurate ordering .",
    "one possible form this incommensurate ordering could take is the appearance of stripes , the segregation of the holes into d - like stripes where the hole kinetic energy is minimized , alternating with a - like stripes of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "depending on the arrangement of such stripes with respect to the underlying lattice , the system could flow under repeated renormalization - group transformations either to the antiferromagnetic or dense disordered sink . since the arrangement of the stripes will vary as we change the temperature or density in the system",
    ", this could lead to a lamellar structure of a and d phases in the resulting phase diagram . though we can not probe the existence of such stripes directly in our approach , an observable consequence of stripe formation",
    "would be the suppression of the chemical potential shift when additional holes are added to the system , since we effectively have a phase separation on a microscopic scale into hole - rich and hole - poor regions .",
    "indeed , inquiries into stripe formation in experimental systems doped away from half - filling often look for this tell - tale pinning of the chemical potential . for example , in the cuprate superconductor la@xmath211sr@xmath212cuo@xmath213 ( lsco ) , photoemission measurements of core levels have shown that the chemical potential shifts by a small amount ( @xmath214 ev / hole ) in the underdoped region , @xmath215 , compared to a large shift ( @xmath216 ev / hole ) in the overdoped region , @xmath217 , an observation which has been interpreted as a possible signature of stripes  @xcite . in non - superconducting systems",
    "where the existence of stripes is clearly established , like the nickelate la@xmath211sr@xmath212nio@xmath213 ( lsno ) , we see a qualitatively similar behavior , with the chemical potential shifting significantly only for high - doping ( @xmath218 for lsno )  @xcite . for the @xmath1 model ,",
    "we take the chemical potential shift as @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the chemical potential below which @xmath164 begins to the decrease noticeably from 1 in the low temperature limit .",
    "[ anis_fig:7 ] shows our calculated @xmath221 vs. hole concentration for the @xmath10 @xmath1 model at four different temperatures . in order to compare with the experimental data for lsco and lsno , we choose an energy scale @xmath222 ev . for the low - doping region , where interplane coupling generates a lamellar structure of a and d phases ,",
    "the slope of the @xmath209 curve remains small . on the other hand , for high - doping , in the range of densities corresponding to the @xmath2 phase , @xmath221 turns steeply downward .",
    "the similarities between this behavior and the experimental data supports the idea of stripe formation in the low - doping region .",
