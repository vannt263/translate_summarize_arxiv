    "radiation damping considerably complicates the equations of motion of charged particles , and for many basic problems , like rutherford scattering , only numerical calculations of the trajectories are available @xcite . in this paper",

    "[ xi - teta ] ) , creating a plateau - like structure in the angular distribution .",
    "even though our perturbative results are not reliable for large corrections , such structure is very similar to what is found in `` exact '' numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "a final point we wish to comment on is why our results are not plagued by runaway solutions .",
    "the reason is that the runge - lenz based perturbative calculation presented here follows essentially a `` reduction of order '' approach , such as described in refs .",
    "this effectively eliminates the additional degrees of freedom introduced in the equations of motion by the time derivative of acceleration , yielding only physically acceptable solutions ."
