    "when using the c - statistic , there is not a straightforward reliable way determining the goodness of fit or comparing whether one model is an improvement over another .",
    "we therefore adopt the posterior predictive p - value ( ppp ) test @xcite in order to assess whether one model fits significantly better than another .",
    "this is a monte carlo based test to see whether the observed improvement in the c statistic between two different models is significant or not .",
    "for instance , we can compare the fit with the neutron star atmosphere model with @xmath12 fixed with the fit with the neutron star atmosphere model with @xmath12 free .",
    "let us call these model 1 and model 2 respectively for the sake of this discussion . in the ppp test",
    "we simulate 1000 sets of two spectra ( one spectrum corresponding to obsid 13711 and one corresponding to obsid 14453 ) using the best fitting model 1 . in simulating the spectra , the parameters for the model",
    "are randomly drawn using the covariance matrix of the best - fit as well as using the exposures and background spectra from the real observation .",
    "these 1000 sets of simulated spectra are then fit with both model 1 and model 2 and the best - fitting c - statistic determined for each model .",
    "we then calculate the difference in the best - fitting c - statistic between model 1 and model 2 ( @xmath20 ) , and define the posterior predictive distribution as the distribution of @xmath20 values .",
    "the ppp value is then calculated by comparing the fraction of instances where the simulated @xmath20 value is greater than the observed value . for the case of comparing the neutron star atmosphere model with @xmath12 fixed with the fit with the neutron star atmosphere model with",
    "@xmath12 free we find that only 13 instances out of 1000 simulations showed a @xmath20 value larger than observed , therefore indicating that the model with @xmath12 free is better than with @xmath12 fixed at the 98.7% confidence level ( @xmath21 ) .    trying an alternative model completely , we fit an absorbed power - law , with the @xmath12 fixed at @xmath13 cm@xmath11 .",
    "this gives a power - law index of @xmath22 .",
    "this power - law index is softer than would be seen usually in quiescent systems where accretion is on - going ( e.g. , cen  x-4 , * ? ? ?",
    "a ppp test comparing the power - law fit with the neutron star atmosphere fit with @xmath12 fixed at the old value shows that the power - law is better at the 99.9% level ( more than 3@xmath4 ) while comparing the power - law with the neutron star atmosphere fit with @xmath12 free shows that the power - law is better at the 94.3% confidence level ( a little less than 2@xmath4 ) .",
    "finally , we also test what happens if we try and fit an absorbed neutron star atmosphere plus power - law model .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the neutron star atmosphere model alone under predicts the count rate above 2 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_compare ] ) possibly indicating the presence of a power - law component in addition to a neutron star atmosphere component .",
    "however , the power - law dominates and the temperature of the neutron star atmosphere goes as low as possible , indicating that two model components is beyond the quality of the data . alternatively ,",
    "if we fix the power - law index at @xmath23 and the @xmath24 at the previous value ( @xmath13 cm@xmath11 ) , then we find that the power - law contributes 58% to the unabsorbed 0.5  10 kev flux and we get @xmath25 ev . if instead we fix @xmath26 we then get a power - law fraction of 62% and @xmath27 ev .",
    "thus , we can not rule out a significant contribution from a power - law component .",
    "a ppp test comparing the neutron star atmosphere with @xmath12 free with the neutron star atmosphere plus power - law model ( with @xmath23 ) indicates an improvement from adding the power - law at the 94.7% confidence level .",
    "note that if we fit all the previous observations with an absorbed neutron star atmosphere plus power - law model we find that the power - law component is not statistically required in any of them .",
    "if we also compare the simple power - law fit with the neutron star atmosphere plus power - law fit ( with @xmath23 ) , we find they give equivalent fits with the ppp test indicating no significant improvement ( 49.9% confidence level ) .",
    "we also compare the 2008 observation with the two observations closely spaced in time taken in 2005 , in order to test whether the 2008 observation is anomalously high rather than the 2012 observation being anomalously low .",
    "we show a comparison of the two sets of observations in figure  [ fig : comp_2005_2008 ] , where we have added the spectra together from obsid 5469 and 6337 given that they were taken only 17 days apart and have similar spectral shapes .",
    "this figure shows that both observations from 2005 and 2008 look very similar , and hence , it appears to be the 2012 observation which is anomalously low .",
    "the 2008 observation does not appear to show clear signs of a strong power - law component which might be expected from signs of on - going accretion as would be indicated by significant emission above 3 kev .",
    "an increased temperature caused by on - going accretion ( see , for instance , temperature increases in xte  j1701@xmath0462 during sporadic accretion events ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also not observed .",
    "but , the 2012 observation does appear to be harder than a simple neutron star atmosphere , and is better fit by a simple power - law ( a power - law gives an improvement over the best neutron star atmosphere model at the 94.3% confidence level ) .",
    "this may possibly indicate some cooling between 2012 and 2008 , though the extremely low count rate limits what constraints we can get on the temperature from the 2012 observation when fitting with a neutron star atmosphere plus power - law model .    29 with best - fitting absorbed neutron star atmosphere model .",

    "we extract the spectrum from nearby source cxou  j170205.9@xmath0295619 from obsids 8984 and 13711/14453 using ` specextract ` .",
    "we find that this source has a constant count rate and spectral shape ( absorbed power - law ) between the observations .",
    "in particular it shows no signs of any changes below 1.5 kev .",
    "we have continued to monitor the spectrum of the crustal cooling source mxb  1659@xmath029  since it entered into quiescence in 2001 . here , we have presented a new _ chandra _",
    "observation from july 2012 ( almost 11 years into quiescence ) .",
    "while initial monitoring of mxb  1659@xmath029  showed that it cooled rapidly over the first few years in quiescence , the observation from 2008 indicated that cooling had appeared to halt @xcite .",
    "however , this new observation shows an unexpected drop in count rate by a factor of 3 since the preceding _ chandra _  observation performed 4 years earlier .",
    "spectral analysis comparing the new 2012 data with the 2008 spectrum shows that the 2012 spectrum is systematically below the 2008 spectrum at energies less than about 11.5 kev ( figure  [ fig : spec_compare ] ) .",
    "we are left with several options to explain the count rate drop between the 2008 and 2012 observations .",
    "firstly , the drop in count rate is not real , but a statistical outlier .",
    "however , note that the drop is at the 3@xmath4 level and that both separate pointings in 2012 show a similar count rate drop . secondly , the neutron star has cooled slightly , but the @xmath12 has remained constant .",
    "thirdly , the neutron star has remained at a constant temperature but the @xmath12 has increased .",
    "fourthly , the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously and the spectrum is now dominated by a ( rather soft ) power - law .",
    "option two is not favored based on spectral fitting - a model with temperature free and @xmath12 remaining constant shows clear residuals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_compare ] ) .",
    "options three and four both give improved spectral fits .",
    "for instance , the fit is improved ( at the 98.7% confidence level ) by fitting an absorbed neutron star atmosphere where the @xmath12 has increased from @xmath13 cm@xmath11 @xcite to @xmath18 cm@xmath11 yet the neutron star temperature is consistent with remaining constant .",
    "alternatively , the spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power - law with index @xmath22 with an unchanged @xmath28 .",
    "let us first examine the possibility of an increase in column density . in this scenario ,",
    "the neutron star is back in thermal equilibrium as we see that the temperature is consistent between the 2008 and 2012 observations .",
    "but , we need a physical motivation to explain the increase in column density  in most systems a change in column density would not be expected .",
    "however , mxb  1659@xmath029  is a nearly edge - on system that shows eclipses both in outburst and quiescence .",
    "models for the accretion disk during quiescence usually have the disk truncated at a few thousand schwarzschild radii , essentially acting as a reservoir for material transferred from the companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "material then builds up in the outer disk during quiescence until an outburst is triggered . at the time of the 2012 observation ,",
    "mxb  1659@xmath029  was almost 11 years into quiescence .",
    "the previous known quiescent period for this object is 21 years @xcite . if mxb  1659@xmath029  follows a similar pattern this time , then it is approximately half way through its quiescent period .",
    "we can speculate , then , that during quiescence the build - up of material could increase the scale height of the outer disk , leading to an increase in absorption .",
    "under such a scenario , we might expect the absorbing column to further increase as quiescence progresses , which can be tested by future observations .",
    "considering standard accretion disk theory , however , a large change in scale height during quiescence is not expected .",
    "if we assume that the standard @xmath29 disk holds during quiescence , then we can determine how the disk properties scale . in order that the truncated disk remains stable , and an outburst is not triggered , the temperature in the outer disk can not rise by a large factor . yet , for a given radius , the height of the disk scales like @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the sound speed and @xmath32 the temperature in the disk ) .",
    "thus , a factor of 2 increase in temperature would only lead to a 40% increase in the disk height .",
    "moreover , the temperature in quiescence is also likely to be colder than when in outburst , thus , a lower scale height would be expected in quiescence .",
    "hence , if standard disk theory holds in quiescence a significant change in disk height may not be plausible .",
    "an alternative explanation for the increase an increase in column density is that the accretion disk could be precessing . in this scenario , during the 2012 observations our line of sight passes through more of the disk than in previous observations .",
    "superorbital periods have been detected in at least 25 x - ray binaries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the two main mechanisms for superorbital periods are precession @xcite or radiation - induced warping @xcite , though see @xcite for suggestions of other possible mechanisms . during quiescence , irradiation of the outer disk",
    "will be many orders of magnitude less than during outburst , thus radiation - induced warping would not be expected .",
    "precession , however , may occur when there is an extreme mass ratio when @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "mxb  1659@xmath029  has a known optical counterpart @xcite , which is thought to be a k0 star @xcite . such a companion , however",
    ", would not lead to the required mass ratio for precession .",
    "no significant detection of a superorbital period has been reported for mxb  1659@xmath029 , though @xcite report a very marginal detection at the 1.2@xmath4 level at a period of about 350 days .",
    "thus , we can not completely rule out the possibility of precession , despite the mass ratio . in this precession scenario",
    ", we would more likely than not see a return to the previous column density in future observations , though this depends on the exact modulation timescale for the precession .",

    "the additional point causes a poor fit at times between 1000 and 3000 days .",
    "note that the final data point becomes consistent with the dotted line if the fit with @xmath12 as a free parameter is used ( open circle).,width=321 ]    we now consider the other possibility , that the spectrum is now dominated by a power - law component .",
    "this would require that the neutron star surface cooled dramatically between 2008 and 2012 .",
    "unfortunately , the data quality does not permit constraints on the neutron star temperature , as a second component ( in addition to the power - law ) is not required by the data .",
    "but , if dominated by the power - law then such a component could be due to low - level accretion during quiescence or alternative mechanisms .",
    "however , there is no sign of a strong power - law component in previous observations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : comp_2005_2008 ] ) , and , the 2008 and 2012 spectra are very similar above about 1.5 kev .",
    "previous observations can be fit by a single absorbed power - law , but such fits give a high power - law index , e.g. obsid 8984 gives @xmath34 . additionally , in the presence of",
    "low - level accretion one would expect a somewhat warmer neutron star component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while here we see a cooler one . moreover , the photon index of approximately 3 is softer than other quiescent neutron stars , especially those that just display a power - law and no clear thermal component , such as exo  1745@xmath0248 @xcite and sax j1808.4@xmath03658 @xcite .",
    "signatures of on - going accretion might include sporadic variability in quiescence as has been seen in several other quiescent neutron stars @xcite , and could be seen via future observations .",
    "if we consider that the spectrum is now power - law dominated , then we must discuss the implications for crustal cooling .",
    "a significant drop in temperature can not be reconciled with the crust cooling models of @xcite .",
    "even a modest drop to just 49 ev ( as implied by the spectral fit with an absorbed neutron star atmosphere and fixed column density ) causes the model to fit the 2005 and 2008 data points poorly , as we show in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "@xcite do show a model ( their figure 12 ) which shows a further decline in temperature at late times .",
    "however , this model is calculated specifically for xte  j1701@xmath0462 , which was accreting above the eddington limit during an outburst of only 1.6 years @xcite .",
    "this high accretion rate for a comparatively short time leads to a crust temperature profile with two peaks - one near the surface , and one in the inner crust , with a dip in between .",
    "this leads to a cooling curve with an initial drop that plateaus ( corresponding to the dip in the crust profile ) and then has a second drop at late times .",
    "for a longer outburst at a lower accretion rate ( as is the case for mxb  1659@xmath029 ) the temperature profile of the crust should be flatter ( without two separate peaks ) , and thus the a second drop in temperature is not expected for mxb  1659@xmath029 .    in conclusion",
    ", we can not definitively explain the cause of the drop in count rate between the 2008 and 2012 observation of mxb  1659@xmath029 .",
    "however , the possible scenarios predict different future behavior .",
    "the picture where material is building up in the outer disk and leading to an increase in absorption leads to the expectation that a further increase in column density could be seen in the future . in the precession scenario",
    "we would most likely expect the @xmath12 to return to its previous value in the future .",
    "alternatively , the explanation involving low - level accretion and a much colder neutron star leads to the expectation of sporadic variability in quiescence .",
    "future observations of mxb  1659@xmath029  can test between these scenarios .",

    "<S> this new observation shows an unexpected factor of @xmath13 drop in count rate and change in spectral shape since the last observation , which can not be explained simply by continued cooling . </S>",
    "<S> two possible scenarios are that either the neutron star temperature has remained unchanged and there has been an increase in the column density , or , alternatively the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously and the spectrum is now dominated by a power - law component . </S>",
    "<S> the first scenario may be possible given that mxb  1659@xmath029  is a near edge - on system , and an increase in column density could be due to build - up of material in , and a thickening of , a truncated accretion disk during quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> but , a large change in disk height may not be plausible if standard accretion disk theory holds during quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the disk may be precessing , leading to a higher column density during this latest observation . </S>"
