    "classical two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence exhibits a well - established universal phenomenology of spectral scaling laws and energy transport , where energy is conservatively transported to large scales through a lossless inertial range , a process known as the inverse energy cascade  @xcite . while the kolmogorov @xmath0 power law associated with an inertial range has been observed in simulations of two - dimensional quantum turbulence ( 2dqt ) in the context of dilute gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , the nature of spectral energy transport in 2dqt remains a crucial open question , with recent studies conflicting over whether energy is transported to large @xcite or small @xcite scales . as a model of a compressible superfluid , the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )",
    "can simultaneously support several regimes of turbulence , including weak wave turbulence  @xcite , negative temperature point - vortex states in decaying @xcite and forced  @xcite quantum turbulence , and evolution near non - thermal fixed points @xcite , offering a rich phenomenology involving coupled quantum vortex and classical wave degrees of freedom .",
    "the major challenge for understanding spectral energy transport in 2dqt is the difficulty in identifying an unambiguous measure of spectral energy flux in a superfluid that is compressible and , in general , dissipative @xcite .",
    "previous identifications of turbulent cascades have relied on a combination of a spectral @xmath1 scaling region and an indirect measure of energy flux , such as vortex clustering and spectral energy condensation  @xcite , energy flux through black - hole horizons in a holographic gravity dual  @xcite , or other approximate methods @xcite , all of which are unable to unambiguously distinguish the conservative transfer of vortex energy between spatial scales from the loss of vortex energy due to the coupling to compressible degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , 2dqt studies have addressed systems for which the importance of vortex - sound interactions varies greatly , leading to quite different results .",
    "this diversity motivates a systematic exploration of the important physical processes in regimes of 2dqt .    here",
    ", we identify regimes of decaying 2dqt within gpe theory by varying the system size and dissipation rate for a given initial condition , allowing systematic control over the importance of vortex - sound interactions . to study the role of energy transport in the different regimes we introduce a dissipative point - vortex model for quantum vortices , to which we add phenomenological vortex - sound interactions .",
    "this model allows us to extract an unambiguous spectral energy flux and analyze the effects of dissipation .",
    "the model agrees well with the damped , projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( dpgpe ) , a physically well - justified model of becs  @xcite , both for large system sizes and for strong dissipation .",
    "we find that for large system sizes and weak dissipation relevant to bec experiments @xcite , as explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , energy is indeed transported to large scales by vortex interactions .",
    "we find time - averaged spectral characteristics broadly consistent with the phenomenology of decaying turbulence in a classical incompressible fluid @xcite , including an approximately lossless inertial range with negative spectral energy flux .",
    "we term this phenomenological regime _",
    "hydrodynamic vortex turbulence_.    in the cases of strong dissipation , and weak dissipation in a small system , this phenomenology is replaced by a dissipative collapse of the spectrum , driven by the formation of vortex dipoles and rapid vortex - antivortex annihilation . while our effective point - vortex model does not accurately describe the dpgpe dynamics in the small system with weak dissipation ( where dominant vortex - sound interactions place the system in a strong wave - turbulent regime ) , the long - time evolution in all these cases appears similar to dynamics generated by the non - thermal fixed point identified in previous classical field studies @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a low - energy , long - lived configuration of a small number of vortices , arranged in vortex dipoles .",
    "in contrast to the regime of hydrodynamic vortex turbulence , the vortex dynamics in these cases is found to lack any significant spectral transport of energy through scale space , and has no direct analogue in classical fluid turbulence .",

    "using our phenomenological point - vortex model , we simulate ensembles of 10 trajectories in a scenario similar to fig .  [",

    "allow us to evaluate these quantities for many vortex configurations ( @xmath98 ) within a reasonable timeframe . when suitably averaged over time and ensemble , in analogy to studies of classical turbulence @xcite , these quantities offer a detailed picture of spectral energy transport in our point - vortex model .",

    "this can create the impression of a transfer of energy towards low @xmath85 during the time - development of our plots of the spectrum ; however , this is caused by the fact that both dissipation and vortex annihilation remove energy preferentially at high @xmath85 . as indicated by the plots of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , the actual transfer of energy to large scales due to vortex interactions",
    "is not significant .    for the case of hydrodynamic vortex turbulence [ fig .",
    "[ fig : flux](c ) ] , dissipation is not significant . the spectrum and flux resemble those of classical decaying 2d turbulence generated from a similar initial concentration of energy , where a transient dual energy - enstrophy cascade is observed @xcite . while the scale ranges are small ( as expected for a system of a few hundred vortices when compared to classical turbulence ) , the spectrum does show some respective @xmath1 and @xmath100 character above and below the scale of the transition from negative to positive flux ( vertical line ) , suggesting that a quasi - classical dual energy - enstrophy cascade may be an emergent phenomenon in large - scale 2dqt .",
    "a potentially powerful feature of our point - vortex model , due to its phenomenological treatment of effects below the vortex core scale , is that it may also be useful to describe the large - scale behaviour of vortices in other superfluids with different microscopic vortex core structure . for instance , as we describe in detail in appendix a , we suspect the regime of dissipative collapse [ fig .",

    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite over the direction of energy transport in decaying 2dqt .",
    "firstly , we used the damped , projected gross  pitaevskii equation ( dpgpe ) to examine several regimes of decaying 2dqt resulting from an unstable lattice - type initial condition . by varying the system size and the dissipation rate we showed the existence of at least three regimes : dissipative dipole gas , strong wave turbulence , and hydrodynamic vortex turbulence .",
    "these findings help to clarify the relation between previous studies of decaying 2dqt that have examined systems from different regimes .",
    "secondly , we introduced a phenomenological point - vortex model that accurately describes the vortex dynamics of decaying 2dqt in most cases ( excepting the case of strong wave turbulence ) .",
    "we have used this model to elucidate the nature of spectral energy transport due to quantum vortex dynamics .",
    "we find that significant spectral energy transport due to vortex interactions occurs only for large systems subject to weak dissipation , and that in this case kinetic energy is transported to large scales .",
    "our results for both energy spectra and energy fluxes provide some indication that a transient dual energy - enstrophy cascade , analogous to that present in the decay of turbulence in a classical fluid , may emerge in large - scale 2dqt .",

    "[ fig : dipoles ] ]    in the main text , we have considered decaying two - dimensional quantum turbulence in a compressible superfluid described by a gross - pitaevskii model .",
    "our results show that in vortex - dominated regimes where sound energy is negligible [ our cases ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ] one observes either dissipative collapse of the spectrum [ strong dissipation , cases ( a ) , ( b ) ] or transport of energy to large scales [ weak dissipation , case ( c ) ] .",
    "one question prompted by these results is how they may be connected to turbulence in holographic 2d superfluids @xcite for which a direct cascade of energy was recently inferred in @xcite .    a problem in connecting our results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite is that , unlike the gross - pitaevskii description , holographic superfluids are not explicitly constructed to describe experimental atomic superfluids .",
    "indeed , the structure of vortex cores in holographic superfluids has been shown to be different from the gross - pitaevskii form @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we note that movies @xcite of the dpgpe evolution in case ( a ) of our work are very similar to the movies of holographic superfluid vortex dynamics in ref .",
    "in particular , both exhibit strong damping of sound waves , rapid vortex - antivortex annihilation , and evolution towards a positive - temperature vortex configuration .",

    "if such a description is appropriate then , according to our results , one would anticipate a dissipative collapse of the spectrum in the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , rather than a @xmath1 spectrum and a direct cascade of energy .",
    "despite the possibility of significant differences between gross - pitaevskii - like and holographic superfluids , for a state with negligible density fluctuations outside of the vortex cores , the kinetic energy spectra of gross - pitaevskii - like and holographic superfluids should in fact be very similar on physical grounds . in particular , in the ultraviolet",
    "the linear scaling of the wavefunction at the vortex core in both superfluids @xcite yields a @xmath100 spectrum , while in the infra - red both systems must recover a configurational point - vortex spectrum .",
    "thus , differences between the gross - pitaevskii and holographic kinetic energy spectra should be confined to the crossover region ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "consequently , a @xmath1 spectrum in the configurational spectrum of a holographic superfluid should be understandable in terms of a point - vortex model .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : dipoles](a ) ] , which do not correspond to classical fluid turbulence @xcite , resemble configurations obtained in case ( a ) and ref .",
    "@xcite after most vortices have been annihilated in a dissipative collapse .",
    "nonetheless , the average spectrum exhibits a roughly half - decade sized region with apparent @xmath1 scaling [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoles](a ) ] .",
    "however , replacing @xmath105 allows recovery of the pure point - vortex spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoles](b ) ] for the same vortex configuration @xcite .",
    "this spectrum follows the single - vortex @xmath106 scaling throughout the apparent @xmath1 region in fig .",

    "consistent with this picture , the ensemble - averaged transfer function and incompressible energy flux [ inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoles](b ) ] show no lossless inertial range .",
    "while the vortex core structure in a holographic superfluid may be different in its details , it quite likely leads to a similar `` accidental '' @xmath1 scaling .",
    "this offers an alternative explanation for the @xmath1 scaling in the spectrum attributed to a direct cascade in ref .",
    "an intriguing question that arises is whether adjusting parameters in the holographic description might yield a regime of weakly - dissipative holographic superfluid behaviour similar to our case ( c ) , recovering the statistical transport of energy to large scales associated with classical 2d turbulence .",
    "recent work @xcite has suggested a positive answer to this question by analogy to a weakly - dissipative point - vortex model , but this has not presently been confirmed by direct simulation of a weakly - dissipative holographic superfluid . directly addressing this question may help to further elucidate the physical nature of holographic superfluids .",
