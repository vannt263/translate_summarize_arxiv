    "spectral analysis of the products of random matrices is a powerful tool in several domains of statistical physics , allowing , for example , to study lyapunov exponents for disordered and chaotic dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "it is also useful in a class of problems related to multiplicative matrix  valued noncommutative diffusion processes  @xcite .",
    "several applications go beyond physics , as for instance , those related to the stability analysis of ecological systems  @xcite or to telecommunication applications based on the scattering of electromagnetic waves on random obstacles  @xcite . in many of those cases ,",
    "some exact analytic results were obtained for relatively small matrices .",
    "interestingly , quite often analytic calculations are possible under another limit  the limit of matrix dimensions tending to infinity .",
    "examples include products of pseudounitary matrices , representing transfer matrices in mesoscopic wires  @xcite , large @xmath0 wilson loops in yang ",
    "mills theory  @xcite or multiplicative diffusion of infinitely large complex and/or hermitian matrices  @xcite . in most of these cases ,",
    "the reason why the exact spectral distribution is within the reach of analytic methods is due to a link to free random variable calculus  @xcite , which is a very powerful technique .",
    "this is also why the spectra of products of large random matrices represent a challenge for mathematicians  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the analysis of the product of large , square , random gaussian matrices , performed in  @xcite , to the product of rectangular matrices .",
    "in particular , we study the product @xmath1 of @xmath2 independent , rectangular , large , random gaussian matrices , @xmath3 , of dimensions @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the eigenvalue and singular value density of @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 and @xmath7 in other words , all matrix dimensions grow to infinity at fixed rates and , obviously , .",
    "the product @xmath5 is a matrix of dimensions @xmath8 and has eigenvalues only if it is a square matrix : @xmath9 .",
    "we assume the matrices in the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) to be complex gaussian matrices drawn randomly from the ensemble defined by the probability measure @xmath10 where is a flat measure .",
    "a normalization constant , fixed by the condition @xmath11 , is omitted .",
    "this is the simplest generalization of the girko ",
    "ginibre ensemble @xcite to rectangular matrices .",
    "the @xmath12 parameters set the scale for the gaussian fluctuations in s .",
    "the entries of each matrix can be viewed as independent centered gaussian random variables , the variance of the real and imaginary parts being proportional to @xmath13 and inversely proportional to the square root of the number @xmath14 of elements in the matrix .",
    "the eigenvalue density of the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) of square gaussian matrices was calculated in  @xcite while the singular value distribution was determined in  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue density was derived using a planar diagrammatic method for non  hermitian matrices  @xcite , while the singular value density was obtained using free random variables calculus  @xcite .",
    "both techniques work in the infinite matrix size limit . after explaining notation  ( section ii ) and listing the main results of the paper  ( section iii )",
    ", we shall follow those same methods to derive the corresponding results for the product of rectangular matrices . in  section iv , we present a diagrammatic derivation of the moment generating function for the product @xmath15 . in  section",
    "v , using the tools of free random variables calculus , we obtain the moment generating function for @xmath16 , recovering results given in  @xcite .",
    "section  vi concludes the paper with a discussion on particular applications of our results and possible generalizations .",
    "let us spend a few words on the notations to be used in this paper .",
    "the eigenvalue density @xmath17 of a hermitian matrix @xmath18 is a real function of real argument , while in the case of a non  hermitian matrix it is a real function of complex argument . in the latter case",
    "we shall write @xmath19 and treat @xmath20 and its conjugate @xmath21 as independent variables .    in the hermitian case ,",
    "the eigenvalue density can be computed from a green s function @xmath22  @xcite which contains the same information as the density itself : @xmath23    for a non  hermitian matrix , the corresponding green s function @xmath24 is non  holomorphic and therefore we shall write it explicitly as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this case the eigenvalue distribution is reconstructed from the green s function as  @xcite @xmath27 actually , this equation reduces to ( [ eq : meanspectraldensityfromgreensfunction ] ) when the non  holomorphic region shrinks to a cut along the real axis , as it happens for hermitian matrices .",
    "the green s function @xmath28 for a hermitian matrix is written as a function of a single argument since everywhere except on the cut one has @xmath29 , and thus it is @xmath26independent .    in many applications",
    "it is often convenient to use the moment generating function , or @xmath30transform , which is closely related to the green s function : @xmath31 . for a hermitian matrix @xmath32 one",
    "has @xmath33 where the @xmath34 s are the moments of the eigenvalue density .",
    "if the matrix @xmath32 is of finite dimensions @xmath35 , the moments are given by @xmath36 .",
    "the moment generating function encodes the same information as the green s function @xmath37 .",
    "thus , one can calculate the corresponding eigenvalue distribution from @xmath38 .",
    "one can also introduce a similar function for non  hermitian matrices : @xmath39 . in this case , however , it does not play the role of a moment generating function anymore , since now one also has mixed moments @xmath40 , which in general depend on the ordering of @xmath18 and @xmath41 in the product under the trace",
    ".    the situation is slightly simplified when the @xmath30transform is a spherically symmetric function : @xmath42 . in this case equation ( [ eq : meanspectraldensityfromnonholomorphicgreensfunction ] ) can be cast into the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the first derivative of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a constant representing the fraction of zero modes . in this case , the eigenvalue distribution is spherically symmetric as well ( see for example @xcite for the product of square matrices ) .",
    "as we shall see later , this is also going to be the case for the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) of rectangular gaussian matrices ( [ eq : rectangularggmeasure ] ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) has eigenvalues only if it is square , while it has singular values for any rectangular shape . as a matter of fact",
    ", its singular values can be determined as the square roots of the non  zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath47 or , alternatively , of the matrix @xmath48 . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are hermitian , and they have non  negative spectra which differ only in the zero modes .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that the eigenvalue distribution and the @xmath30transform of the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) are spherically symmetric .",
    "we shall show the @xmath30transform to satisfy the @xmath51th order polynomial equation @xmath52 where the scale parameter is @xmath53 .",
    "when all of the matrices involved are square , this equation reproduces the results in @xcite .",
    "an analogous equation for @xmath49 reads @xmath54 it is an algebraic equation of order @xmath55 , and it was first obtained in  @xcite in the context of wireless telecommunication .",
    "equations ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) and ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) are strikingly similar .",
    "they actually differ only by the prefactor in front of the product . moreover ,",
    "the free argument in the first equation is @xmath56 , while @xmath25 in the second one .",
    "this observation represents the second main result of this paper .",
    "since conventions used in telecommunication theory and in physics differ a bit , in section  v we rederive equation ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) for completeness .",
    "when @xmath5 is a square matrix , then @xmath57 and the square root at the beginning of equation ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) can be omitted .",
    "when the product of square matrices is considered , all of the @xmath58 s become equal to unity and the two equations take the following form : @xmath59 equations can be easily rewritten in terms of the corresponding green s functions ( see the previous section ) . if one does that and then applies the prescriptions in ( [ eq : meanspectraldensityfromnonholomorphicgreensfunction ] ) and ( [ eq : meanspectraldensityfromgreensfunction ] ) respectively , it becomes clear that @xmath60 in the more general case of rectangular matrices , when solving equations ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) and ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) for the green s functions , one can then see that only those brackets in which @xmath61 contribute to the singularity at zero , while all others approach a constant for @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue density displays the following singularity @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of those ratios among @xmath65 which are exactly equal to unity .",
    "on the other hand , the eigenvalue density of @xmath49 behaves as @xmath66    the third result we want to mention here is a heuristic form for the finite size corrections to the eigenvalue distribution . for a large but finite order of magnitude @xmath0 of the matrices involved ,",
    "the eigenvalue distribution is still spherically symmetric .",
    "so , let @xmath67 denote the radial profile of this distribution , where @xmath68 .",
    "as we shall show , the evolution of the radial shape with the size @xmath0 is very well described by a simple multiplicative correction : @xmath69 in the @xmath70 limit the correction becomes a step function , so that @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 otherwise .",
    "the shape of the limiting radial distribution @xmath74 comes from the solution of ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) .",
    "this type of finite size corrections can be derived analytically for girko ",
    "ginibre matrices @xcite . here",
    "we show that it also works very well for the eigenvalues of the product of gaussian matrices .",
    "it is very generic and possibly applies to other random matrix ensembles with spherically symmetric eigenvalue densities .",
    "in this section , we present a derivation of the main result of this article , equation ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) , a realization of it in the case @xmath75 , and numerical simulations to confirm our findings . to this end , we employ a technique for summing planar diagrams , the dyson  schwinger equations ( more precisely described in @xcite ) , extended to a non  hermitian framework .",
    "the evaluation of the green s function for a _ product _ @xmath5 of random ensembles by means of planar diagrammatics is non ",
    "linear w.r.t .",
    "the constituent matrices .",
    "it is possible to linearize the problem by means of the following trick  @xcite . consider the following block matrix : @xmath76 it is a matrix of dimensions , where .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath51-th power of @xmath77 is a block diagonal matrix  @xcite @xmath78 with square blocks @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , being cyclicly permuted products of @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "all these blocks have identical non  zero eigenvalues .",
    "they differ only in the number of eigenvalues , which may vary from block to block .",
    "the first diagonal block @xmath84 is equal to the product @xmath5 ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) .",
    "taking into account that this block has dimensions @xmath85 , while the total matrix @xmath86 has dimensions , one can easily deduce the following relation between the @xmath30transforms of @xmath5 and : @xmath87 the importance of this relation relies in the fact that one can use it to calculate from .",
    "the latter can be calculated using dyson ",
    "schwinger equations , since the matrix @xmath77 is linear w.r.t .",
    "the constituent matrices @xmath88 .",
    "the first step in writing the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations is to know the propagators of the random matrix in question , namely , or more precisely its `` duplicated '' version : @xmath89 we shall think of it as a four  block matrix , each block being an @xmath90 block matrix .",
    "we shall denote the @xmath90 block indices in these four blocks by @xmath91 ( upper left corner ) , ( upper right ) , ( lower left ) , ( lower right ) , each one covering the range @xmath92 ; for example .",
    "all the other matrices involved shall inherit this same structure .",

    "in the following we show how to derive formula ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) , _ i.e. _ , an @xmath149th order polynomial equation obeyed by the @xmath30transform ( which , as already discussed , encodes the same information contained in the spectral density ) of the hermitian matrix ( [ eq : singularvaluesdefinition ] ) , @xmath5 being the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) of rectangular ( [ eq : thermodynamiclimit ] ) gaussian random matrices ( [ eq : rectangularggmeasure ] )",
    ". our result agrees with that in  @xcite , obtained in the context of wireless telecommunication theory , provided we synchronize the conventions . in particular , our resolvent @xmath150 relates to stieltjes transform as @xmath151 .",
    "the underlying idea will be to rewrite @xmath49 as a product of some hermitian matrices in order to apply the techniques provided by free random variables ( frv ) calculus .",
    "loosely speaking , frv calculus ( initiated by the pioneering works of speicher and voiculescu _ et al . _ ) can be thought as the extension of standard probability theory to non  commutative objects , such as matrices . given the broadness of the topic , we shall not attempt any introductory discussion here , and we refer the non  expert reader to @xcite .",
    "let us commence by defining , for any @xmath3 , a square matrix @xmath152 being a generalization of @xmath49 which includes only the first @xmath122 random matrices , as well as a square matrix , which differs from only in the position of the last matrix in the string , _",
    "i.e. _ , , which is now placed as the first matrix in the string , @xmath153 we are interested in the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix .    the orders of the terms in the two above products ( [ eq : sv01 ] ) , ( [ eq : sv02 ] ) are related to each other by a cyclic shift , therefore , for any integer @xmath154 , there will be .",
    "hence , the @xmath30transforms ( see equation ) of the two above random matrices are related by the following relation @xmath155 now , let us consider the functional inverse of the @xmath30transform , called the @xmath0transform , defined as : @xmath156 . employing this definition within equation one easily obtains @xmath157    now , since it can be safely stated that independent random matrices become free with respect to each other in the thermodynamical limit , it becomes clear that the reason for introducing the auxiliary matrix @xmath158 is that it is a product of two free matrices , and .",
    "then , the frv multiplication @xcite law for free matrices can be applied .",
    "such law states that the @xmath0transform of the product of two free matrices , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , is simply given by @xmath161 .",
    "( in the language more often found in the literature on the subject , the @xmath0transform is replaced by the so  called @xmath162transform , , which then obeys a simpler multiplication law , ) .",
    "so , when applying this relation to the @xmath158 matrix one can write , for @xmath163 @xmath164    from equations ( [ eq : sv04 ] ) and ( [ eq : sv05 ] ) , we now eliminate the @xmath0transform of the auxiliary , which leaves us with the following recurrence relation for the @xmath0transform of , @xmath165 with the initial condition , @xmath166 which stems from ( [ eq : sv04 ] ) and from the fact that . the solution of this recurrence ( [ eq : sv06 ] ) , ( [ eq : sv07 ] ) is then readily found to be @xmath167    it remains now to find the @xmath0transforms of the random matrices .",
    "they are examples of the so  called `` wishart ensembles '' , and the problem of computing their @xmath0transforms , with the same normalization of the probability measures ( [ eq : rectangularggmeasure ] ) of the s which we are employing , has first been solved in @xcite : expressions ( 1.8 ) , ( 2.8 ) , ( 2.13 ) , ( 2.14 ) of this article yield the green s function of , which immediately leads to the pertinent @xmath0transform , @xmath168 substituting ( [ eq : sv09 ] ) into ( [ eq : sv08 ] ) , one finally arrives at the desired formula for the @xmath0transform of , @xmath169 with @xmath130 defined as in the previous sections . in other words , the corresponding @xmath30transform satisfies the following polynomial equation of order @xmath170 , @xmath171 or in the case of ( _ i.e. _ , , required when one wishes for @xmath5 to have eigenvalues too ) , @xmath172 this completes our derivation of ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) .    ) for the mean spectral density of the random matrix ( [ eq : singularvaluesdefinition ] ) .",

    "the main contribution of this article is equation ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) for the @xmath30transforms of the product ( [ eq : productdefinition ] ) of an arbitrary number @xmath51 of independent rectangular ( [ eq : thermodynamiclimit ] ) gaussian random matrices ( [ eq : rectangularggmeasure ] ) . knowing the @xmath30transform one can easily calculate the eigenvalue density of the product ( [ rm ] ) , which turns out to be spherically symmetric in the complex plane .",
    "we also discussed a striking resemblance of equation ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) to the corresponding equation ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) of the hermitian matrix ( [ eq : singularvaluesdefinition ] ) , whose eigenvalues are equal to the squared singular values of @xmath5 .",
    "both these equations are polynomial ( of orders @xmath51 and @xmath55 respectively ) , so in general they may only be solved numerically ; however , some properties of the mean spectral densities can still be retrieved analytically , such as their singular behavior at zero ( [ eq : rhopsingularityatzero ] ) , ( [ eq : rhoqsingularityatzero ] ) .",
    "we are tempted to conjecture that this similarity of the @xmath30transforms for @xmath5 and @xmath49 is generic for random matrices possessing rotationally symmetric average distribution of the eigenvalues , and that the corresponding equations differ only by the prefactor which we have discussed while comparing ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) and ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) . for such models , the non ",
    "holomorphic @xmath30transform is a function of the real argument , thereby allowing for functional inversion , and hence for a definition of the `` rotationally  symmetric non ",
    "holomorphic @xmath0transform ''  even though for general non  hermitian random matrices a construction of a `` non  holomorphic @xmath0transform '' remains thus far unknown .",
    "this new @xmath0transform is then conjectured to be in a simple relation to the ( usual ) @xmath0transform of the hermitian ensemble . in a typical situation",
    ", the latter will be much more easily solvable than the former , owing to the plethora of tools devised in the hermitian world , albeit the opposite may be true as well .",
    "this is indeed the case here  our derivation of ( [ eq : mpbasicequation ] ) , based on non  hermitian planar diagrammatics and dyson ",
    "schwinger s equations , is much more involved than a simple application of the frv multiplication rule leading to ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] )  and consequently , the aforementioned hypothesis would provide a shortcut to avoid complicated diagrammatics . to the best of our knowledge , this would be the first use of free random variables calculus to compute the mean spectral density of a non  hermitian product of random matrices .",
    "we have also suggested a heuristic model of the finite  size behavior of the density of @xmath5 near the edge of the eigenvalues support ( [ eq : eig47 ] ) , deducing it from analogous considerations  @xcite made for the girko ",
    "ginibre ensemble , where this behavior is known analytically .",
    "it performs outstandingly well when checked against numerical simulations .",
    "let us also remark that one could argue , as for square matrices , that the large@xmath0 limit result is the same for elliptic gaussian ensembles  @xcite .",
    "we also believe that one can further weaken the assumptions on the matrices involved , just requiring them to belong to the gaussian universality class of matrices having independent entries and fulfilling the pastur  lindeberg condition  @xcite ( the matrix analogue of the generalized central limit theorem in classical probability theory  @xcite ) .",
    "one unexpected implication of such universality is that a product of random matrices whose spectra do not necessarily display rotational symmetry has an eigenvalue distribution which does possess rotational symmetry on the complex plane ( _ i.e. _ , the average density depends only on @xmath174 ) .",
    "information theory for wireless telecommunication has been intensively developed in the past decade , after it had been realized that in a number of situations the information transmission rate can be increased by an introduction of multiple antenna channels , known as the `` multiple  input , multiple ",
    "output '' ( mimo ) transmission links . the mimo capacity for gaussian channels has been calculated in the pioneering work  @xcite , triggering large activity in the field .",
    "immediately , it became clear that an appropriate language and methods to address this type of problems are provided by random matrix theory ( consult  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the model considered in our paper can be applied to a situation of signals traveling over @xmath51 consecutive mimo links .",
    "the signal is first sent from transmitters via a mimo link to receivers , which then re  transmit it via a new mimo link to the subsequent receivers , _ etc . _ clearly",
    ", the capacity will depend on these numbers of intermediate re  transmitters ; in particular , if any of the s is small , the capacity will be reduced .",
    "the effective propagation is given by the matrix .",
    "such a model of multifold scattering per propagation path has been already proposed in @xcite , where the moment generating function , the @xmath30transform , for @xmath175 was calculated .",
    "our result for the @xmath30transform for @xmath176 complements this calculation .",
    "let us also mention that one could imagine a more general situation , where mimo links form a directed network  each directed link @xmath91 representing a single mimo channel between transmitters and receivers .",
    "( the previously discussed case corresponds to a linear graph , @xmath177 . )",
    "a complex directed network of mimo links is somewhat similar to the structures appearing in the context of quantum entanglement . there",
    ", one considers graphs whose edges describe bi ",
    "partite maximally entangled states , while vertices describe the couplings between subsystems residing at the same vertex  @xcite . in the simplest case of a graph consisting of a single link ,",
    "it is just a bi ",
    "partite entangled state .",
    "the corresponding density matrix for a bi ",
    "partite subsystem is given by , where @xmath159 is a rectangular matrix defining a pure state , being a combination of the basis states in the subsystem , and ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "one can easily find that linear graphs with additional loops at the end vertices correspond .",
    "the density matrix for the subsystem sitting in the end vertex is given by , where  @xcite .",
    "if all the subsystems are of the same size , the average spectral distributions @xcite of @xmath49 are known as the `` fuss  catalan family ''  @xcite ; they can be obtained from ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) by setting all the s to @xmath178 . however",
    ", if the subsystems have different sizes , one needs to apply our general formula ( [ eq : mqbasicequation ] ) .",
    "finally , another area of applications of our approach is related to multivariate analysis . the main building block there is the wishart ensemble , corresponding to @xmath179 in our formalism .",
    "the link between the spectral properties of @xmath176 and @xmath180 may allow one to avoid the well  known bottleneck caused by the non  hermiticity of time  lagging correlation functions .",
