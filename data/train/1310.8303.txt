    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , comprising a black hole or neutron star primary ( @xmath8 ) and a low mass main sequence or evolved secondary ( @xmath9 ) , produce x - rays through the accretion of matter onto their primaries ( see reviews by e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all black hole and many neutron star lmxbs are transient , experiencing occasional outbursts during which their mass accretion rate and x - ray luminosity increase by several orders of magnitude . these outbursts have typical durations spanning days to months .",
    "the cycle of outburst and quiescence in lmxbs is explained by the disc instability model ( see e.g.  the review by * ? ? ?",
    "mass transferred from the secondary builds up in an accretion disc around the primary . as the disc density increases",
    ", the temperature rises to the point at which hydrogen ionizes .",
    "the change in ionization state is associated with a switch to higher viscosity , increasing mass accretion onto the primary and causing an outburst .",
    "this enhanced accretion eventually lowers the disc density and temperature to the point at which the viscosity returns to its original value . unlike cataclysmic variables , where outbursts are terminated by a cooling wave after a few days , the outbursts of lmxbs are prolonged by x - ray irradiation , which heats the disc and traps it in the hot , ionized state @xcite . in sufficiently short period systems",
    "the whole disc is irradiated and the majority of the disc mass is accreted .",
    "the accretion rate during an outburst is known to decay exponentially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unless the disk is entirely irradiated ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "it was characterised by @xcite as : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the disc density and @xmath12 is the viscosity , where @xmath13 is the hot state viscosity parameter , @xmath14 is the sound speed , and h is the vertical scale height of the disk .",
    "the maximum extent of the disc , @xmath15 , is limited by the size of the roche lobe of the primary and can be related to the orbital period ( @xmath16 ) . for typical mass ratios ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 cm , where @xmath19 is the orbital period in hours and @xmath20 is the primary mass in solar masses .",
    "both the peak accretion rate ( @xmath21 ) and outburst duration ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the disc mass ; c.f .  section 3 ) depend inherently on the orbital period .",
    "the radiative efficiency of accretion in an lmxb is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for a radiatively efficient flow through a thin accretion disc ( see e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low accretion rates cooling becomes inefficient and a radiatively inefficient , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) can occur @xcite .",
    "the adaf model is a solution to the hydrodynamical equations of viscous differentially rotating flows with low sub - eddington accretion rates .",
    "the accreting gas has a very low density , leading to an optically thin flow which can not cool efficiently within an accretion time .",
    "the viscous energy is stored in the gas as thermal energy rather than being radiated away , and is advected onto the central compact object . the transition from radiatively efficient to inefficient flow",
    "is expected to take place once the accretion luminosity reaches a few percent of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath3 ) . for black hole primaries , which lack a hard surface , @xmath26 and",
    "the accretion energy is carried with the mass flow into the hole or transferred elsewhere , e.g as radio jets or mechanical outflows .",
    "neutron star primaries do not experience a drop in accretion efficiency because the advected energy must always be radiated from the stellar surface .",
    "hence , at sufficiently short periods ( and thus small disc radii and peak accretion rates ) black hole lmxbs will undergo fainter , shorter outbursts than comparable neutron star systems , making them more difficult to detect .",
    "the relationship between orbital period and peak outburst luminosity for lmxbs is well established ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite studied the outburst luminosities of a sample of transient lmxbs observed by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "they showed that there was no distinguishable difference in the orbital period - peak outburst luminosity relation of black holes compared to neutron star primaries , when luminosities were measured in eddington units .",
    "however , they suggest that the two populations may diverge at short periods . along similar lines , note that the low peak outburst luminosities in short period black hole lmxbs can cause them to remain in a low luminosity - hard spectral state , rather than entering the high luminosity - soft state expected for radiatively efficient accretion .",
    "this breed of outburst , where sources remain in the low - hard state throughout , has been observed in several sources @xcite    in addition to establishing a relation between orbital period and peak outburst luminosity , @xcite point out that the absence , in their dataset , of black holes with orbital periods of @xmath27hr , may be caused by radiatively inefficient accretion lowering the peak outburst luminosities of these systems . in this paper , we investigate this hypothesis , using the ritter - kolb catalogue @xcite to show that there is statistical evidence for a dearth of black holes in lxmbs at short orbital periods .",
    "we suggest that this is caused by the increasing importance of radiatively inefficient accretion in black hole systems lowering not only peak outburst luminosities but also outburst durations and x - ray duty cycles . additionally , we investigate the nature of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion , modelling it as an instantaneous change to @xmath1 = 0 at a fraction @xmath2 of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and as a power law decrease , @xmath4 , below @xmath28 . in section 2",

    "where the a - d test reports no statistically significant result ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , we need to remove the eight shortest period ns systems ( from the ns transient sample ) or include four additional bh systems with periods @xmath38d .",

    "the relative observable outburst duration of black hole and neutron stars is affected by their distance from us , which determines the minimum luminosity , @xmath113 at which they can be detected .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : vary_dist ] , where the observable timescales ( @xmath109 ) are plotted for a black hole lmxb ( green dashed line ) and a neutron star lmxb ( solid red line ) as a function of orbital period , at distances of 5 , 10 and 15 kpc in the upper , middle and lower panels respectively . these correspond to limiting luminosities of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 erg / s respectively . at orbital periods",
    "greater than @xmath59 0.2 days , the outburst duration for black hole systems is longer than that for neutron star systems in all three cases . however , at low orbital periods , neutron star lmxbs may be visible for longer .",

    "it is particularly interesting that this transition lies in the expected range of a few percent of @xmath3 , as any other reason for the relative population difference would give arbitrary values of @xmath2 .",
    "switch b does not produce a significant difference between the black hole and neutron star orbital period distributions , predicting 7 ( 6 ) black holes below 0.17 days , for f = 0.03 ( 0.05 ) .",
    "if all lmxbs are 8 kpc from the earth , @xmath147 is either 0 or 1 , depending on their orbital period . in our galaxy however , the probability of a source being detected while in outburst depends on its distance , since closer sources will be visible for longer .",
    "therefore , when observing the lmxbs in our galaxy , @xmath147 may range between 0 and 1 , depending on the fraction of sources which are detectable . to address this issue",
    ", we now repeat our calculation using a galactic distribution of lmxbs .",
    "the milky way stellar population comprises a disk , bulge and spheroidal component . studied the population of lmxbs in our galaxy , and modelled them using these three components , and found a ratio of 2:1:0.8 of the mass of lmxbs in the disk : bulge : spheroid respectively .",
    "the spheroidal component takes account of globular cluster lmxbs , which are not part of our study , so we do not include this in our calculations .",
    "we distribute lmxbs in a disk : @xmath162 where @xmath163 and a bulge , following the parameterisation of @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 we use parameters of @xmath166 = 6.5kpc , @xmath167 = 3.5kpc , @xmath168 = 0.41 kpc , @xmath169 = 1.9kpc , @xmath170 = 0.1kpc , @xmath171 kpc and @xmath172 0.6 kpc .",
    "we normalise both distributions by containing them within 16 kpc , the outer edge of our galaxy , and by requiring a ratio of 2:1 of binaries in the galactic disk , and bulge , assuming direct proportionally between number ratios and the mass ratios calculated in    on the left panel of figure [ fig : sim ] we plot this distribution , with 500 binaries , where @xmath173 , and @xmath174 are the cartesian coordinates in the plane of the galaxy , and on the right panel this is converted into a normalised histogram of their distance from the earth ( located at @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) the vertical lines on this plot represent the distances out to which black hole lmxbs with orbital periods of 0.01 ( green dashed line ) and 0.1 ( purple dotted line ) days are guaranteed to be observed by _ rxte _ when in outburst , i.e. @xmath153 .",
    "these two lines bracket a significant proportion of the distribution , implying that short orbital period systems in this distance range are unlikely to be observable .",
    "in particular it is clear that an efficiency switch , shortening the outburst time , may significantly affect the likelihood of observing short orbital period systems .      in order to recreate the detection probabilities and predictions of figure",
    "[ fig : nosim ] using a distribution in lmxb distances , we run a monte carlo simulation of lmxbs in the galaxy .",
    "we create 200 000 lmxbs ( 100 000 each of black hole and neutron stars ) with the same orbital period .",
    "these systems are distributed in 3 dimensions over the galactic disc and bulge by randomly selecting @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 so that they follow the distributions in ( [ eqn : disk_distribution ] ) and ( [ eqn : bulge_distribution ] ) respectively .",
    "the detection probability is then evaluated for each system and averaged to give an overall detection probability of lmxbs at that orbital period .",
    "we run models for orbital periods ranging from 0.01 to 100 days , until a convergence of @xmath180 has been reached .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig : mcsim ] , in the same style as figure [ fig : nosim ] . additionally , in the upper panels , we plot the detection probability ratios with no efficiency switch for disk lmxbs only , as a faint red line .",
    "this relation differs from the equivalent ratios plotted in figure [ fig : nosim ] ( solid red line ) , because @xmath147 now takes fractional values .",
    "below @xmath59 0.2 days , the most distant black hole lmxbs in the galaxy become undetectable , because they have lower peak luminosities than neutron stars ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : varyf ] ) .",
    "this causes the black hole lmxb detection probabilities , and hence the relative detection probabilities , to decrease .",
    "however , below @xmath59 0.04 days , the ratios begin to increase again . this is because the neutron star detection probability ratio drops more steeply than the black hole one .",
    "this effect is visible in figure [ fig : vary_dist ] . from 15kpc ( bottom panel ) , to 5 kpc ( top panel ) , the observable outburst timescale for short orbital period systems increases for both neutron star and black hole lmxbs , as the limiting luminosity becomes lower .",
    "however , the rate of increase for black holes is more significant",
    ". therefore , as systems out to greater distances , like 15kpc and 10 kpc become undetectable , the black hole lmxbs become more observable than neutron star systems .",
    "the same shape can be seen in the disk + bulge result ( solid red line ) , but here , another feature is present ; a sharp decrease in the relative detection probabilities at an orbital period of @xmath181 days .",
    "this is due to the black hole bulge population becoming undetectable .",
    "while the results for the sharp switch case are the same as in figure [ fig : nosim ] , the smooth efficiency switch now alters the predicted black hole orbital period distribution more significantly . however , these results predict 6 ( 5 ) black hole systems below 0.17 days when f = 0.03 ( 0.05 ) , so a smooth switch can not explain the absence of observed short orbital period black hole lmxbs .",
    "while the sharp switch is still more successful at reproducing the observed distribution , it appears that at higher values of @xmath2 ( @xmath182 0.05 ) the smooth switch may have a similar effect .      in the previous plots ,",
    "@xmath183 has been fixed at 0.4 @xmath83 . however , the actual dependence of @xmath183 on the systems other properties is uncertain , and it is likely that @xmath183 increases with orbital period .",
    "for this reason , we repeat our models with secondary masses that adhere to the main - sequence , roche lobe filling relation , @xmath184 @xcite , with the results plotted in figure [ fig : varm2 ] . here",
    "the relative detection probability curves have a different shape at high orbital periods , leading to minor differences in the predicted black hole population distributions in the lower panels .",
    "however , despite this difference , the actual effect of the efficiency switches does not change ; a sharp switch , with predictions of 0 ( 0 ) observable black hole systems below 0.17 days when f = 0.03 ( 0.05 ) is still able to reproduce the divergence in black hole and neutron star systems , whereas a smooth switch , with corresponding predictions of 5 ( 4 ) does not .",
    "the discontinuity ( at @xmath186 days ) in the duty cycles plotted in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : varyf ] , is due to the switch in accretion mode from magnetic braking to gravitational radiation as described in ( [ eqn : mdot2 ] ) , and also produces a feature in the relative detection probability plots .",
    "since this is in the orbital period range we are interested in , we also checked that our results were not sensitive to this switch by redoing our models with ( a ) a constant @xmath185 and ( b ) no gravitational radiation mode at short orbital periods .",
    "these changes alter p(@xmath161 1 outburst ) , which describes the shape of the relative detection probability plots .",
    "they have no effect on @xmath147 which depends on the accretion efficiency switch . therefore our results , and the effect of different types of accretion switch on the predicted black hole orbital period distributions , are unaltered      since observations do not show consistent recurrence times for single sources , we have tested the resilience of our results to allowing a range of recurrence times at each orbital period . in the extreme case , the time spent in quiescence after each outburst is independent of any previous event . in this case",
    "we can assume a poisson distribution of outbursts so that :    @xmath187    where @xmath188 = @xmath143/ @xmath156 .",
    "this affects the shape of the black hole to neutrons star detection ratio plots ( upper panels of figure [ fig : nosim ] ) , but not enough to change the results in the lower panels , so does not affect our conclusions .",
    "within the framework of the simple outburst model above , it is clear that the lack of known black hole lmxbs at short orbital periods can be explained by a transition to radiatively inefficient accretion , provided the switch to inefficient accretion is sharp .",
    "we assume a fixed primary mass as well as constant disc densities and viscosities .",
    "all of these are likely to vary between observed systems and would produce differences in the details of the orbital period distributions . a more robust treatment aimed at reproducing the observed period distributions would require detailed population synthesis calculations incorporating these factors . some of the major causes of uncertainty are discussed below .",
    "the results above are sensitive to our choices of @xmath11 , @xmath60 , and the black hole @xmath72 , which we investigate in figures [ fig : varyrho ] , [ fig : varynu ] and [ fig : varycorr ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : varyrho ] we plot the same 6 panels as in figure [ fig : varyf ] .",
    "the solid red line represents an @xmath189 black hole system assuming no switch to inefficiency at low luminosities .",
    "the other 3 lines show the effect of varying @xmath11 .",
    "each line assumes f = 0.03 , and the same @xmath60 as used previously ( @xmath190 @xmath62 s@xmath58 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath11 shown are , in order of decreasing density , @xmath191 g @xmath52 ( dark blue dotted line ) , @xmath192 g @xmath52 ( purple , fine dotted line line ) and @xmath193 g @xmath52 ( light blue dot - dashed line ) . both the peak luminosity relation and the orbital period at which the sharp switch ( switch a ) produces a cut - off in the distribution ,",
    "are affected by changes in density .",
    "the smooth switch ( case b ) also varies . by requiring that the gradient and peak luminosity normalisation match observational expectations it is possible to rule out the higher density cases .    similarly in figure",
    "[ fig : varynu ] , we plot the same systems , with f = 0.03 , but this time we keep the density at its original value ( @xmath192 g @xmath52 ) and allow @xmath60 to vary .",
    "we choose values of @xmath194 @xmath67 s@xmath58 ( dark blue dotted line ) , @xmath195@xmath67 s@xmath58(purple fine dotted line ) and @xmath196 @xmath67 s@xmath58 .",
    "( light blue dot - dashed line ) .",
    "varying @xmath60 has a similar effect to varying @xmath11 for the peak luminosities .",
    "however , in addition , the timescales , which are inversely proportional to @xmath60 , are extended by decreasing @xmath60 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : varycorr ] , @xmath60 and @xmath11 are fixed at their original values , and we vary @xmath72 , the correction factor applied to the bolometric luminosity of the black hole systems , to estimate the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this depends on the inner disc temperature , which is likely to range from 0.5 to 1 kev .",
    "we plot values of 2.5 ( dark blue dotted line ) , 4 ( purple fine dotted line ) and 8.5 ( light blue dot - dashed line ) , which correspond to disk temperatures of 1 , 0.7 and 0.5 kev respectively .",
    "varying @xmath72 alters the luminosities of the sharp switch case , and all three panels corresponding to the smooth switch case , in a similar way to varying @xmath60 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the inefficiency switch luminosity ( @xmath59 2 @xmath74 @xmath197 ergs s@xmath58 ) is higher than the limiting luminosity at all values of @xmath72 shown , varying this parameter does not affect the timescale or duty cycle plots when a sharp efficiency switch is implemented .",
    "it is clear that our choices of @xmath11 and @xmath60 , which are inherently uncertain , significantly affect the feasibility of the sharp switch to inefficiency explaining a short orbital period black hole deficit .",
    "in addition , @xmath72 , which depends on the black hole temperature , is likely to affect the normalisation of our results .",
    "however , in all cases the smooth switch scenario only produces a `` turn - off '' the known peak luminosity - orbital period relation at higher orbital periods than observed .      we now investigate how sharp the switch needs to be , to produce the observed cut - off . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios2 ] we vary the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath91 such that :    @xmath42    a larger value of @xmath44 more closely approximates the sharp switch scenario .",
    "here we show the relative detection probabilities on the top panel for n = 1 ( green dashed ) , n = 3 ( dark blue dotted ) and n = 5 ( purple dotted ) for f = 0.03 on the left panel and f = 0.05 on the right - hand panel . indices of @xmath7 appear to fit the black hole distribution as well as the sharp switch itself , provided f = 0.05 , with a prediction of 1(0 ) observable black hole systems below 0.17 days for n = 3(5 ) .",
    "the above discussion is based on detections possible with the _ rxte _ asm , which discovered several new black hole transients during its 15 year mission ( e.g. xte j1118@xmath198480 , xte j1650 - 500 , xte j1550@xmath19956 ) .",
    "however , there have been , and still are , many other surveys capable of discovering bhb transients , each with different sensitivity levels , energy coverage , time resolution and sampling .",
    "rxte _ also routinely performed scans of the galactic bulge region with the pca detectors , capable of detecting fainter sources but reduced angular and temporal coverage compared to the asm .",
    "these scans discovered the bh candidate xte j1752@xmath199223 among others .",
    "presently , the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on the @xmath200 mission detects known and new transients in the 15 - 150 kev range , making it sensitive to the bright low / hard states of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhb ) during outburst in addition to its higher sensitivity in crab units .",
    "this has been operating since 2004 and discovered several new systems including @xmath200 j1753.5@xmath1980127 , a short period ( 3.24 hr ) black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "since 2009 the @xmath201 monitor has been scanning almost the entire sky in the 2 - 20 kev x - ray band every 96 minutes and has detected several new transients .",
    "both @xmath200 and @xmath201 detected a new transient @xmath201 j1659@xmath198152 , later identified as another short period bhb .",
    "these , together with other past and current missions , increase our sensitivity to bhbs compared to using the _ rxte _ asm alone , increasing the chance of detecting outbursts in galactic bhbs except at very low peak luminosity and/or very long recurrence times ( @xmath18210 years ) .",
    "we also note that in calculating the relative detection probabilities , we have neglected some of the bias that is likely to exist in the ritter - kolb catalogue .",
    "systems with confirmed orbital periods must have had an optical follow - up after their initial x - ray detection .",
    "such a follow - up may be unsuccessful if the x - ray flux is very uncertain , or if the optical / ir counterpart is too faint .",
    "both of these factors are biased against short period systems .",
    "we justify neglecting these issues by arguing that they are likely to affect black hole and neutron star systems equally , so would not enter into the ratio calculations .",
    "the fact that the values of @xmath2 fall in the expected theoretical range provides good support for the premise that the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion underpins the lack of black hole lmxbs at short periods .",
    "alternative arguments for the lack of black hole systems ( based on system evolution , selection effects etc ) would produce arbitrary values of @xmath2 , and the fact that the cut off period for black hole lxmbs happens to agree with theoretical expectations for radiatively inefficient accretion would be purely coincidental .    despite this support for a sharp change in @xmath1 , observations do not show a sudden change in bolometric luminosity at the efficiency switch boundary .",
    "in addition , observational evidence ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests a smooth switch between efficient and inefficient flows .",
    "these factors suggest that , rather than being lost to the black hole , accretion power may be shifted out of the x - ray band , through a sharp change in @xmath72 .",
    "this may mean that systems become detectable in other wavelengths , making it harder for short orbital period black hole lmxbs to `` hide '' through inefficient accretion . we will consider the detection of hard x - ray dominated lmxb spectra in future work .",
    "it is worth noting that black hole lmxbs with @xmath186 day would be expected to produce low luminosity ( @xmath59 few % @xmath3 ) and short ( @xmath59 1 day ) outbursts .",
    "these systems would have low detection probabilities and would be rare , but may be observable in locations where formation conditions were favourable .",
    "it may be possible that short period black hole lxmbs form some fraction of the low - luminosity , short - duration very fast x - ray transients observed in the galactic centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> by comparing the orbital period distributions of black hole and neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the ritter - kolb catalogue @xcite we show that there is statistical evidence for a dearth of black hole systems at short orbital periods ( @xmath0 h ) . this could either be due to a true divergence in orbital period distributions of these two types of system , or to black hole lmxbs being preferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the latter possibility , by investigating whether black hole lmxbs could be concealed by a switch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the peak luminosity and the duration of x - ray binary outbursts are related to the disc radius and , hence , the orbital period . at short periods , where the peak outburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient accretion , </S>",
    "<S> black hole lmxbs have lower outburst luminosities , shorter outburst durations and lower x - ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems . </S>",
    "<S> these factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short period black hole lmxbs relative to those containing neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole lmxbs using two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion : an instantaneous drop in accretion efficiency ( @xmath1 ) to zero , at a fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and a power - law efficiency decrease , @xmath4 , for l @xmath5 l@xmath6 . we show that a population of black hole lmxbs at short orbital periods can only be hidden by a sharp drop in efficiency , either instantaneous or for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved by a genuine drop in luminosity or through abrupt spectral changes that shift the accretion power out of a given x - ray band .    </S>",
