    "recent experimental data on elastic scattering of high energy protons @xcite show quite surprising phenomenon of increase of the ratio of elastic to total cross sections with energy increase in the interval from isr to lhc energies .",
    "this share used to decrease at lower energies but reversed the tendency at isr ( for the comparison see the tables in @xcite ) . moreover , at lhc energies it approaches the critical value @xcite . for the first time , that phenomenon can reveal the transition from the branch of the unitarity condition dominated by inelastic processes where elastic scattering is treated as the shadow of inelastic collisions to the dominance of elastic scattering which would require new interpretation .",
    "elastic scattering of polarised protons or charge asymmetries of pions produced in inelastic collisions could help in studies of different possibilities .",
    "the information about elastic scattering comes from the measurement of the differential cross section @xmath3 at some energy @xmath4 as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath5 at its experimentally available values .",
    "it is related to the scattering amplitude @xmath6 in a following way @xmath7 the variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the squared energy @xmath8 and transferred momentum of colliding protons in the center of mass system @xmath9 , @xmath10 at the scattering angle @xmath11 . from this measurement one",
    "gets the knowledge only about the modulus of the amplitude .",
    "the interference between the nuclear and coulomb contributions to the amplitude @xmath12 allows to find out the ratio of the real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath13 just in forward direction @xmath14 @xmath15 but not at any other values of @xmath5 .",
    "the typical shape of the differential cross section at high energies contains the exponentially decreasing ( with increase of @xmath16 ) diffraction cone with energy dependent slope @xmath17 and more slowly decreasing tail at larger transferred momenta with much smaller values of the cross section .",
    "the most stringent and reliable information about the amplitude @xmath12 comes from the unitarity of the @xmath18-matrix @xmath19 or for the scattering matrix @xmath20 @xmath21 where the whole @xmath22-particle phase space @xmath23 is integrated over .",
    "it relates the amplitude of elastic scattering @xmath24 to the amplitudes of @xmath22-particle inelastic processes @xmath25 declaring that the total probability of all outcomes of the interaction must be equal 1 . ] . in the @xmath4-channel",
    "this indubitable condition is usually expressed in the form of the well known integral relation ( for more details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this relation can be simplified to the algebraic one using the fourier ",
    "bessel transform of the amplitude @xmath12 which retranslates the momentum data to the shortest transverse distance between the trajectories of the centers of colliding protons called impact parameter @xmath26 and is written as @xmath27 the unitarity condition in the @xmath26-representation reads ( for the review see , e.g. , refs @xcite ) @xmath28 the left - hand side describes the transverse impact - parameter profile of inelastic collisions of protons ( for more detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "it satisfies the inequalities @xmath29 and determines how absorptive is the interaction region depending on the impact parameter ( with @xmath30 for the full absorption and @xmath31 for the complete transparency ) .",
    "the profile of elastic processes is determined by the subtrahend in eq .",
    "( [ unit1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is integrated over the impact parameter , it leads to the cross section of inelastic processes . the terms on the right - hand side would produce the total cross section and the elastic cross section , correspondingly .",
    "at the beginning , let us study the energy dependence of interaction profiles for central collisions of impinging protons at @xmath33 .",
    "then the condition ( [ unit1 ] ) is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is proportional to the experimentally measurable dimensionless ratio of the elastic cross section @xmath36 ( or the diffraction cone slope @xmath37 ) to the total cross section @xmath38 .",
    "it is computed integrating the experimentally measured @xmath3 so that any approximation can easily be estimated .",
    "the approximation sign refers to the neglected factor @xmath39 . according to experimental data @xmath40(7 tev , 0)@xmath41 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is uniquely determined by the normalization of the amplitude @xmath12 .    thus , according to the unitarity condition the absorption for central collisions is governed by a single experimentally measured parameter @xmath42 related to the share of elastic processes . for central ( @xmath33 ) collisions , the inelastic profile @xmath43 achieves the maximum value equal to 1 ( the full absorption ) at @xmath44 .",
    "it decreases parabolically @xmath45 for any decline of @xmath42 ( @xmath46 ) from 1 , i.e. , it is very small for small decline @xmath47 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath43 imposes the limit @xmath48 . at @xmath49 the complete transparency of central collisions @xmath50",
    "is achieved .",
    "the elastic profile also reaches 1 at @xmath33 for @xmath51 and completely saturates the total profile for @xmath49 .",
    "the experimentally measured share of elastic processes demonstrates non - trivial dependence on energy ( see the table in @xcite ) . at low energies up to isr the parameter @xmath42 decreases ( from about 1 down to values about 2/3 ) but then starts increasing and reaches its critical value 1 for 7 tev data at lhc .",
    "it is intriguing whether this increase will really show up in experiments at higher energies or it will be saturated asymptotically with @xmath42 tending to 1 from below .",
    "the saturation would lead to the conservative stable situation of slow approach to full absorption in central collisions while further increase will require the transition to another branch of the unitarity equation and new physics interpretation .    to explain these statements let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gz ] ) as @xmath52 one used to treat elastic scattering as a shadow of inelastic processes .",
    "this statement is valid when the branch with negative sign is considered because it leads to proportionality of elastic and inelastic contributions for small @xmath53 .",
    "that is typical for electrodynamics ( e , g .",
    ", for processes like @xmath54 ) and for optics .",
    "therefore the increase of the elastic share at diminishing role of inelastic production came as a surprise .",
    "however , for strong interactions , this share is close to 1 ( see the table ) .",
    "the approach of @xmath42 to 1 at 7 tev corresponds to complete absorption in central collisions .",
    "this value is considered as a critical one because from ( [ zeta ] ) one gets significant conclusion that the excess of @xmath42 over 1 implies that the unitary branch with positive sign is at work .",
    "this branch was first considered in @xcite with application to high energy particle scattering . that changes the interpretation of the role of elastic processes as being a simple `` shadow '' of inelastic ones .",
    "some slight trend of @xmath42 to increase and become larger than 1 can be noticed from comparison of totem data at 7 tev @xcite where it can be estimated have been used . ] in the limits 1.00 and 1.02 and at 8 tev @xcite where it is about 1.04 though within the accuracy of experiments about @xmath550.024 .",
    "the precise data at 13 tev are needed .",
    "the further increase of the share of elastic scattering with energy is favored by extensive fits of available experimental information for the wide energy range and their extrapolations to ever higher energies done in refs @xcite as well as by some theoretical speculations ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "the asymptotical values of @xmath42 are about 1.5 in refs @xcite and 1.8 @xcite .",
    "they correspond to incomplete but noticeable transparency at the center of the interaction region .",
    "the detailed shape of the inelastic interaction region can be obtained with the help of relations ( [ gamm ] ) , ( [ unit1 ] ) if the behavior of the amplitude @xmath6 is known .",
    "its modulus and the @xmath56 values are obtained from experiment .",
    "the most prominent feature of @xmath57 is its rapid exponential decrease with increasing transferred momentum @xmath16 , especially in the near forward diffraction cone . inserting the exponential shape in eqs",
    "( [ ze ] ) , ( [ gamm ] ) one can write @xmath58 let us stress that the diffraction cone dominates the contribution to @xmath59 in eqs ( gam2 ) , ( ze ) so strongly that the tail of the differential cross section at larger @xmath16 can be completely neglected at the level less than 0.1@xmath60 by itself and it is suppressed additionally by the bessel function @xmath61 .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation was estimated using fits of the experimental differential cross section outside the diffraction cone by simplest analytical expressions .",
    "moreover , it was shown @xcite by computing how well the versions with direct fits of experimental data and with their exponential approximation coincide if used in the unitarity condition .",
    "therefore the expression ( [ gam2 ] ) can be treated as following directly from experiment and being very precise .",
    "herefrom , one calculates @xmath62 correspondingly , the shape of the inelastic profile for small @xmath56 is given by @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{ge}\\ ] ] it depends on two measured quantities - the diffraction cone width @xmath17 and its ratio to the total cross section @xmath42 , and scales as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "it has the maximum at @xmath65 with maximum absorption @xmath66 for @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ( which is the case , e.g. , at isr energies )",
    "one gets incomplete absorption @xmath69 at any physical @xmath70 with the largest value reached at @xmath33 because the real maximum of @xmath71 would appear at non - physical values of @xmath26 for lower energies .",
    "then the disk is semi - transparent .    at @xmath51 , which is reached at 7 tev",
    ", the maximum is positioned exactly at @xmath33 , and maximum absorption occurs there , i.e. @xmath72 . the disk center becomes black .",
    "the strongly absorptive core of the inelastic interaction region grows in size compared to isr energies ( see @xcite ) as we see from expansion of eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) at small impact parameters : @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{gb}\\ ] ] the negative term proportional to @xmath74 vanishes at @xmath51 , and @xmath75 develops a plateau which extends to quite large values of @xmath26 ( about 0.5 fm ) .",
    "the plateau is very flat because the last term starts to play a role at 7 tev ( where @xmath76 gev@xmath77 ) only for larger values of @xmath26 .    with further increase of elastic scattering , i.e. , at @xmath78 , the maximum shifts to positive physical impact parameters .",
    "a dip is formed at @xmath26=0 leading to a concave shaped inelastic interaction region - approaching a toroid - like shape ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this dip becomes deeper at larger @xmath42 .",
    "the limiting value @xmath49 leads to complete transparency at the center @xmath33 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it can be only reached if the positive sign branch of the unitarity condition is applicable .",
    "all these features are demonstrated in fig . 1 borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "@xmath79 correspond to isr and lhc energies and agree well with the result of detailed fitting to the elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "a further increase of @xmath42 leads to the toroid - like shape with a dip at @xmath33 .",
    "the values @xmath80 are proposed in @xcite and @xmath81 in @xcite as corresponding to asymptotical regimes .",
    "the value @xmath49 corresponds to the `` black disk '' regime ( @xmath82 ) . for more discussion of the black disk and the geometrical scaling see refs @xcite.,height=340 ]",
    "the asymptotical regimes with further increase of the share of elastic scattering proposed in refs @xcite predict the diminished absorption for central collisions .",
    "the whole space structure reminds the toroid ( tube ) with absorbing black edges which looks as if being more and more transparent for the elastic component at the very center .",
    "however , the realistic estimates of its effects at the energies 13 tev and 100 tev @xcite show that extremely high accuracy of experiments will be necessary to observe these effects .",
    "that is especially true because the cross sections of processes with small impact parameters are very small . integrating the total and elastic terms in eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) up to impact parameters @xmath83 one estimates their roles for different radii @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 , \\label{el}\\ ] ] @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{tot}\\ ] ] one gets that the contribution of processes at small impact parameters @xmath87 diminishes quadratically at small @xmath88 . in particular , inelastic processes contribute at @xmath88 as @xmath89 the maximum intensity of central collisions is at @xmath51 . that has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation of jets excess in very high multiplicity events at 7 tev as an indication on the active role of gluons at that energy .",
    "it tends to 0 for @xmath90 .",
    "thus , one predicts the diminished role of jet production from central collisions with increase of @xmath42 .",
    "it would ask for extremely precise data to reveal any evolution of that effect at higher energies because according to estimates of refs @xcite the decline from criticality is very small up to 100 tev : @xmath91 .",
    "the peripheral regions dominate , especially in inelastic processes .",
    "the spatial region of elastic scattering as derived from the subtrahend in eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) is strongly peaked in the forward direction .",
    "the contribution to the elastic cross section is suppressed at small @xmath26 and comes mainly from impact parameters @xmath92 .",
    "the average value of the squared impact parameter for elastic scattering can be estimated as @xmath93 inelastic processes are much more peripheral .",
    "the ratio of the corresponding values of squared impact parameters is @xmath94 this ratio exceeds 2 already at lhc energies and would become equal to 6 for ( would be ! ) @xmath49 .",
    "the peripherality of inelastic processes compared to elastic ones increases with increase of the share of elastic collisions .",
    "the intriguing increase of the share of elastic processes to the total outcome observed at energies from isr to lhc attracts much attention nowadays . its approach to 1/4 at lhc can become a critical sign of the changing character of processes of proton interactions if the above tendency of increase persists .",
    "the concave central part of the inelastic interaction region would be formed .",
    "the inelastic interaction region looks like a toroid hollowed inside and strongly absorbing in its main body at the edges .",
    "the role of elastic scattering in central collision becomes increasing .",
    "that is surprising and contradicts somewhat to our theoretical prejudices . from the formal theoretical point of view",
    "it requires to consider another branch of the unitarity condition that asks for its physics interpretation .",
    "it is hard to believe that protons become more penetrable at higher energies after being so dark in central collisions with @xmath72 at 7 tev unless some special coherence within the internal region develops .",
    "moreover , it seems somewhat mystifying why the coherence is more significant just for central collisions but not at other impact parameters where inelastic collisions become dominant .",
    "the role of string junction in fermionic hadrons can become crucial .",
    "the relative strengths of the longitudinal and transverse components of gluon ( string ) fields can probably explain the new physics of hollowed hadrons .",
    "one could imagine another classical effect that `` black '' protons start scattering in the opposite direction @xcite like the billiard balls for head - on collisions .",
    "snell s law admits such situation for equal reflective indices of colliding bodies . that can be checked if forward and backward scattered protons can be distinguished in experiment .",
    "then they should wear different labels .",
    "one could use the proton spin as such a label . in principle , experiments with polarised protons can resolve the problem . however , the more realistic classical scenario in this case would be complete breaking the balls into pieces , i.e. dominance of inelastic processes .",
    "another hypothesis @xcite treats the hollowed internal region as resulting from formation of cooler disoriented chiral condensate inside it ( `` baked - alaska '' dcc ) .",
    "the signature of this squeezed coherent state would be some disbalance between the production of charged and neutral pions @xcite noticed in some cosmic ray experiments .",
    "however the cross sections for central collisions seem to be extremely small as discussed above . the failure to find such events at fermilab",
    "is probably connected with too low energies available .",
    "it leaves some hope for higher energies in view of discussions above .",
    "total internal reflection of coherent states from dark edges of the toroid can be blamed for enlarged elastic scattering ( like transmission of laser beams in optical fibers ) .",
    "the transition to the deconfined state of quarks and gluons in the central collisions could also be claimed responsible for new effects ( see ref .",
    "the optical analogy with the scattering of light on metallic surface as induced by the presence of free electrons is used .",
    "again , it is hard to explain why that happens for central collisions while peripheral ones with impact parameters near @xmath95 are strongly inelastic .",
    "the last , but not the least , is the hypothesis that centrally colliding protons at @xmath49 remind solitons which `` pass through one another without losing their identity . here",
    "we have a nonlinear physical process in which interacting localized pulses do not scatter irreversibly''@xcite .",
    "non - linearity and dispersive properties ( the chromopermittivity @xcite ) of a medium compete to produce such effect .    to conclude ,",
    "the problem of increasing elastic cross section can be only solved by experiment at higher energies .",
    "if this tendency persists , one should invent new ways of explaining the transition to quite uncommon regime of proton interactions with peculiar shapes of the interaction region .",
