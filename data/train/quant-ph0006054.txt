    "the particular one considered generally depends on the system under consideration .",
    "a scheme may violate one bell inequality but not another .",
    "recently an overview of bell s inequalities has been given by peres @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental tests of bell s inequality have already been performed @xcite using entangled _",
    "photons_. in this paper we propose an experimental test of bell s inequality on two macroscopically separated _ atoms_. each atom possesses a two - level system with the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we describe a scheme which allows us to prepare the atoms in an arbitrary superposition of a maximally entangled state and a product state which is of the form @xmath2 in a deterministic way .",
    "to do so we make use of a recently proposed idea by beige _",
    "@xcite of how to manipulate the decoherence - free states of @xmath3 atoms inside a cavity .",
    "together with the control over the prepared state which can be obtained by following a measurement proposal by cook @xcite based on `` electron shelving '' this allows us to investigate , characterise and test bell s inequality with a very high precision and detection efficiency",
    ".    the success rate for the preparation of the initial atomic state ( [ instate ] ) will be denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "if a photon is emitted in the preparation , the scheme fails .",
    "if these events are not detected and ignored this leads to a decrease of the observed violation of bell s inequality . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scheme succeeds the fidelity of the prepared state is very close to unity .",
    "therefore we estimate , that bell s inequality is violated as long as the preparation probability exceeds @xmath5 , if the scheme is intended to prepare the atoms in the maximally entangled state . in this paper",
    "we determine @xmath4 and show that it can , in principle , be arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "other tests using atoms or ions have been proposed@xcite .",
    "for instance an experiment , based on the proposal by cirac and zoller@xcite , to entangle two atoms in a cavity has been performed by hagley _",
    "four trapped ions , respectively , have been entangled experimentally in a deterministic fashion by sackett _",
    "et al._@xcite following a proposal by mlmer and srensen@xcite .",
    "but a test of bell s inequality using atoms has yet to be realised .",
    "the main limiting factor in these experiments is _ dissipation_@xcite .",
    "as opposed to this , the scheme proposed here is based on the presence of finite decay rates and should therefore be less demanding experimentally .",
    "the investigation we are examining here is not strictly a strong @xcite test of quantum mechanics versus local realism due to the limited spatial separation of the atoms . for a strict test the scheme would require separating the two atoms by a distance larger than the speed of light times the measurement time .",
    "however this atom based experiment closes the detection inefficiency loophole while the photon experiments close the causality loopholes @xcite . in the scheme we propose , the observable which",
    "is expected to violate bell s inequality is measured in _",
    "each _ run of the experiment and the state of the two atoms can be determined with almost unity efficiency and a very high precision@xcite .",
    "hence this proposed experiment should be seen as complementary to the photon experiments .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in the next section with a description of a simple scheme based on two two - level atoms inside a cavity that can be used to generate the entangled state ( [ instate ] ) .",
    "we describe the single qubit rotation and a way to measure the state of the atoms .",
    "the required parameter regime is , however , experimentally demanding . therefore , in section iii , a scheme is introduced based on two four - level atoms .",
    "this system behaves exactly like in the two - level atom case described above and the discussion in section ii is used to obtain the same results . in section",
    "iv we discuss how to test bell s inequality and for which parameters a violation of the inequality is expected .",
    "a final discussion of the results can be found in section v.",
    "to prepare two two - level atoms in the entangled state ( [ instate ] ) they are placed at fixed positions in a cavity which acts as a resonator for an electromagnetic field . the atoms ( or ions )",
    "can be stored in the nodes of a standing light field or in a linear trap . in the following @xmath6",
    "denotes the ground state and @xmath7 the excited state of atom @xmath8 , respectively , and we assume that the cavity field is in resonance with the atomic transition .",
    "we also assume that the coupling constant of each atom with the cavity field is the same and given by @xmath9 , which can be chosen to be real .",
    "the cavity should be non - ideal , that is a photon can leak out with a rate @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the spontaneous decay rate of each atom equals @xmath11 .",
    "the distance between the atoms inside the cavity should be much larger than an optical wavelength .",
    "this allows us to address each atom individually with a laser pulse . the rabi frequency for atom @xmath8",
    "will be denoted by @xmath12 and is in general complex , because we have already chosen @xmath9 to be real .",
    "+    to test bell s inequality the atoms have to be moved out of the cavity . this can be done by moving the optical lattice or by applying an electric field , respectively , if the atoms are inside a linear ion trap .",
    "another possibility is to let the two atoms fly together through the cavity field during each run of the experiment .    in the experiment",
    "we propose , the probability for spontaneous emission of a photon or leakage of a photon through the cavity mirrors will be shown to be small .",
    "this immediately suggests that we use the quantum jump approach @xcite .",
    "this method leads to a _ conditional _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath13 which gives the time evolution of the system under the condition of no photon emission . due to the non - hermiticity of @xmath13 , the norm of",
    "the state vector @xmath14 decreases with time and the probability @xmath4 for _ no _ photon emission up to time @xmath15 is given by the squared norm @xmath16 if no photon is emitted , the state of the system at time @xmath15 is the state ( [ phit ] ) normalised to unity .      to prepare the atoms in state ( [ instate ] ) we will take advantage of the fact that two - level atoms inside a cavity possess _ trapped _",
    "states @xcite which can also be used to obtain an example of a decoherence - free subspace @xcite .",
    "if the atoms are in a trapped state they can not transfer excitation into the resonator field , even if upper levels are populated .",
    "therefore , if the cavity field is empty and spontaneous emission can be neglected no photon can be emitted by the system and the system is in a _ decoherence - free _ state .    to find the decoherence - free states of the system",
    "let us first assume that the two atoms are inside the cavity , but _ no _ laser field is applied .",
    "we choose the interaction picture in a way that the atoms and the cavity mode plus environment are considered as the free system .",
    "then the conditional hamiltonian equals , as in ref .",

    "decoherence - free states arise if no interaction between the system and its environment of free radiation fields takes place .",
    "if we neglect spontaneous emissions ( @xmath19 ) this is exactly the case if the cavity mode is empty @xcite and it is @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the systems own time evolution due to the interaction between the atoms and the cavity mode should not move the state of the system out of the decoherence - free subspace . using eq .",
    "( [ hcond ] ) this leads as in ref .",
    "@xcite to the condition @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the state of the atoms only . from this condition",
    "we find that the decoherence - free states are the superpositions of the two atomic states @xmath23 and @xmath24 which can be shown by using eq .",

    "we can make use of an effect which can easily be understood in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the entangled state given in eq .",
    "( [ instate ] ) corresponds to a decoherence - free state .",
    "we assume now that the system is initially in its ground state which is also decoherence - free .",
    "if now rapidly repeated measurements are performed on the system of whether the state of the system still belongs to the decoherence - free subspace or not , the laser interaction can not move the state of the system out of this subspace .",
    "only a time evolution inside the subspace is possible .",
    "hence the laser pulse can introduce entanglement into the system which is not possible in the free atom case .",
    "equivalently we can interpret this inhibition without invoking zeno effects as a simple consequence of adiabatic elimination using the separation of the frequency scales in eq .",

    "let us define @xmath27 as the time in which a photon leaks out through the cavity mirrors with a probability very close to unity if the system is initially prepared in a state with no overlap with a decoherence - free state .",
    "on the other hand , a system in a decoherence - free state will definitely not emit a photon in @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the observation of the free radiation field over a time interval @xmath27 can be interpreted as a measurement of whether the system is decoherence - free or not @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is indicated by an emission or no emission of a photon .",
    "this interpretation also holds to a very good approximation in the presence of the laser field because the effect of the laser over a time interval @xmath27 can be neglected , which is why condition ( [ cond ] ) has been chosen . as it has been shown in ref .",

    "the system discussed here has the appeal that the atoms are massive particles compared with photons and hence our proposal tests quantum mechanics in an all new macroscopic regime .",
    "in addition , while the photon experiments close the casualty loophole , the proposed atom experiment would close the detection efficiency loophole . therefore",
    ", the experiment we discuss is complementary to the current photon experiments being performed .    _ to summarise _ , entanglement is a necessary quantum resource used in quantum information .",
    "while entangled photons have to date been the engine of much recent work , their ` flying ' nature renders them inappropriate for the storage of information .",
    "we have discussed a means in which trapped ions or atoms become entangled in a controlled way using dissipation , and the degree to which the resulting entanglement can be measured through bell correlations .",
