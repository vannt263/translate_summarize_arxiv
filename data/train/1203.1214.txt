    "the aim of this note is to give an extension of a result due to jonathan partington ( recalled below in proposition  [ theorem_partington ] ) saying that _ strong _ stabilizability is a robust property of the plant in the chordal metric .",
    "the basic and almost unique ingredient in the proof of this fact is a result proved by partington in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2.1 , p.84 ) ( which we have restated in lemma  [ lemma_partington ] ) .",
    "the only new point is that we prove that the analogous result holds in an abstract setting , hence expanding the domain of applicability from the original setting of unstable plants over @xmath0 to ones over arbitrary rings of stable transfer functions satisfying mild assumptions .",
    "( here , as is usual in the control engineering literature , @xmath0 denotes the hardy algebra of bounded holomorphic functions defined in the complex open right half plane @xmath1 . )",
    "we recall the general _ stabilization problem _ in control theory .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is an integral domain with identity ( thought of as the class of stable transfer functions ) and let @xmath3 denote the field of fractions of @xmath2 .",
    "then the stabilization problem is :    * given @xmath4 ( an unstable plant transfer function ) , * find @xmath5 ( a stabilizing controller transfer function ) , * such that ( the closed loop transfer function ) @xmath6\\ ] ] * belongs to @xmath7 ( that is , it is stable ) .",
    "the demand above that @xmath8 guarantees that the `` closed loop '' transfer function of the signal map @xmath9 \\mapsto \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] in the interconnection of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as shown in figure  [ figure_feedback_config ] , is stable .",

    "controller @xmath16 which stabilizes @xmath10 .",
    "if such a @xmath11 exists , then we say that @xmath10 is _",
    "strongly stabilizable_.    in the _ robust stabilization problem _ , one goes a step further than the stabilization problem .",
    "one knows that the plant is just an approximation of reality , and so one would really like the controller @xmath11 to not only stabilize the _ nominal _",
    "plant @xmath17 , but also all sufficiently close plants @xmath10 to @xmath17 . the question of what one means by `` closeness '' of plants thus arises naturally .",

    "@xmath18 is amenable to computation , and 3 .",
    "stabilizability is a robust property of the plant with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "there are various known metrics which do the job , notably the gap metric ( @xcite ) , the graph metric ( @xcite ) and the vinnicombe @xmath19-metric ( see @xcite for the rational transfer function case and @xcite , @xcite for its recent extension for nonrational transfer functions ) .",
    "this last metric is in some sense the `` best '' one , as it is comparatively easy to compute and admits some sharp robustness results .",
    "the vinnicombe metric itself arose from a very natural idea of defining a metric between meromorphic functions in the complex right half plane , namely the pointwise chordal metric , defined below .",
    "this metric has been studied by function theorists ( see for example @xcite ) , since it is a natural analogue of the @xmath0 distance between bounded analytic functions , and it can be used for functions with poles in a disk .",
    "the use of the chordal metric to study robustness of stabilizability was made by ahmed el - sakkary in @xcite .    if @xmath20 are two meromorphic functions in the open right half plane , then the _ chordal distance _",
