    "in the talk we will try to convince the readers that dibaryons should be considered as basic degrees of freedom in nuclear ( similarly to nucleons and pions ) and also in hadronic physics .",
    "moreover , they may serve as a most appropriate basis for non - conventional nuclear physics based on qcd .",
    "these claims are based on some strong arguments and also fundamental theory . due to a limitation of space , we present here a few such arguments only ( for more detailed arguments see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) :    \\(i ) a few recent studies made independently  @xcite have demonstrated with evidence that traditional obe - based approach to the basic intermediate - range attraction in @xmath0 system , which uses the scalar @xmath1-meson exchange ( or the @xmath2-channel two - pion exchange with intermediate @xmath3 interaction in scalar - isoscalar channel ) fails to reproduce the strong intermediate - range @xmath0 attraction which is basis for nuclear binding in all traditional force models .",
    "\\(ii ) the values of cut - off parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ,  ) taken in all obe - based @xmath0 models ( @xmath7  gev / c ) are at least in 2 3 times higher than the values needed to describe quantitatively the @xmath8-production in @xmath9-collisions or @xmath10-meson absorption in @xmath11 , @xmath12he etc . and also as compared with all theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "so , there is no one consistent choice for the cut - off parameters @xmath13 able to describe correctly both elastic and inelastic @xmath0 scattering or @xmath10-meson production and absorption .",
    "\\(iii ) many hadronic experiments with nuclei done in the kinematical region forbidden for a single - nucleon interaction ( the so - called cumulative experiments ) show a large yield of particle products , which can be explained only by an interaction of incident hadron with tightly correlated few - nucleon clusters in nuclei , the degree of short - range correlations being incompatible with any traditional nuclear force models , but may be interpreted quite naturally as a manifestation of multi - quark ( i.e. @xmath14- , @xmath15- ,  ) bags in nuclei .",
    "moreover , it was claimed by jaffe many years ago that qcd does not forbid the existence of such multi - quark bags and if _ they do not exist there should be the special qcd - based forbidness which we do not know now .",
    "so , the incorporation of dibaryons in hadronic and nuclear physics might help to overcome such fundamental difficulties and to put a proper cornerstone to the ground of qcd - based nuclear physics .",
    "if the mass of mesons exchanged between two nucleons exceeds 500  mev ( this relates to all mesons except pion ) the respective characteristic scale for meson - exchange @xmath0 interaction is less than 0.5  fm , i.e. the meson exchange proceeds when two nucleons overlap deeply and thus the picture of two isolated nucleons which are exchanged with a such heavy meson gets fully meaningless .",
    "the picture becomes much closer to a unified @xmath14-bag surrounded with @xmath10- , @xmath1 , @xmath17- , etc .",
    "mesonic fields .",
    "we developed the respective microscopic quark - meson model for such dressed six - quark bag as an intermediate in a short - range @xmath0 interaction ( see fig .",
    "1 )  @xcite :    this @xmath18-channel mechanism replaces the conventional @xmath2-channel ( i.e. yukawa - like ) mesonic exchange at ranges @xmath19 .",
    "using this mechanism as a guide we constructed  @xcite the respective potential model for @xmath0 interaction which easily fits ( with a few free parameters only ) the @xmath0 phase shifts at lower partial waves until 1  gev and higher .",
    "this simple model predicts the deuteron properties even more accurately than the best modern phenomenological @xmath0 potentials like argonne , nijmegen etc .",
    "models .",
    "recently , this new force model has been reformulated  @xcite using a fully covariant effective field theory ( eft ) approach . in the approach",
    "the intermediate dibaryon is described on the basis of @xmath20 transition ( @xmath21 means here two color three - quark clusters connected by a gluonic string which form the dibaryon @xmath22 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this transition can be represented through the non - local lagrangian density : @xmath23 |2,1\\rangle- i\\langle 4,3|\\mathrm{i}|2,1\\rangle,\\ ] ] where t means time - ordering while the bra and ket @xmath24 and @xmath25 relates to the initial and final nucleons with 4-momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the nonlocal lagrangian density @xmath28 , includes two terms : @xmath29 describes the transition to a bare dibaryon state with possible spins @xmath30 while @xmath31 represents the dressing of the bare @xmath14-bag with its meson cloud  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath32 can be expressed through the dibaryon wavefunctions and respective dibaryon propagators @xmath33 for which we solve the dyson equation using the basis of relativistic ( dirac ) oscillator .",
    "after lengthy algebra one gets eventually the analytical expression for relativistic @xmath0 potential which includes also an imaginary part responsible for the meson production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the potential includes the matrix elements of polarization operator , the latter can be represented through the graphs :    , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    if the total energy exceeds that of the @xmath34-threshold the @xmath34-production process in scalar - isoscalar channel will proceed via intermediate ( renormalized ) @xmath1-meson with enhanced probability  @xcite which can naturally explain a few puzzles related to @xmath34-production cross sections in @xmath9 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc .",
    "collisions ( e.g. the abc puzzle etc . ) .",
    "appearance of dibaryon mode in the fundamental @xmath0 interaction must result in the appearance of the dibaryon components in nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "in fact , it was shown in our extensive @xmath37 calculations  @xcite with the dibaryon model for nuclear force that the presence of the strong scalar - isoscalar field in the dibaryon leads to the strong exchange force between dibaryon and nucleons surrounding it ( this force is nothing else but a specific three - body force ( see fig .",
    "it is important to stress here that the @xmath1-meson mass and width in these graphs are renormalized noticeably due to partial chiral symmetry restoration around the dense multiquark bag .",
    "so , the @xmath1-meson mass gets much lower and has been estimated to be the value @xmath38  mev which should be compared to the free @xmath1-meson mass @xmath39  mev . so that , the renormalized @xmath1-meson around the bag resembles the quasi - stable scalar @xmath1-meson of the old obe models .",
    "the exchange by the quasi - stable @xmath1-meson leads inevitably to strong attractive force between dibaryon and other nucleons.in our @xmath37 calculations  @xcite we have found that this new three - body force gives , at least , a half of the total nuclear binding energy and contributes strongly to other important observables .",
    "moreover , the total weight of the dibaryon component in @xmath37 wavefunction is as large as 10% or even higher .",
    "this large admixture of the very compact multi - quark bag components in all nuclei should play decisive role in short - range @xmath0 correlations and description of nuclear properties at high momentum and energy transfers .",
    "furthermore , according to the general principles of quantum theory a new degree of freedom must lead to respective new currents , e.g. in e .-",
    "m . processes .",
    "so that we derived such a new isoscalar current in deuteron , which gives very essential m1- and e2-contributions to circular polarization of @xmath40-quanta in @xmath41 radiation capture process with thermal neutrons  @xcite , and also to deuteron magnetic form factor at @xmath42  gev and some corrections to deuteron magnetic moment .",
    "the intermediate dibaryon should contribute strongly also to numerous hadronic processes like single- and multi - meson production and near - threshold production of heavy mesons ( @xmath17 , @xmath43  ) in @xmath9 , @xmath36 etc .",
    "collisions at intermediate energies 1 - 5  gev  @xcite , in numerous electro- and photoproduction processes like @xmath44 and two - nucleon electro- and photo - disintegration processes like @xmath45 , @xmath46 etc .",
    "thus , the characteristic features in the majority of hadron - nucleus or photon - nucleus processes accompanying with high momentum or energy transfer must be related to the interaction of high - energy projectile with dibaryon as whole .",
    "the latter process should be described in terms of qcd - based approaches .",
    "hence , one can summarize : _ the dibaryon physics can be viewed as a very appropriate `` window '' through which the full qcd enter the whole nuclear physics . _    the authors appreciate the financial support of their work from rfbr ( grants nos .",
