    "after encountering some serious problems , cosmologists had to improve the standard big - bang model adding some parts to it .",
    "the flatness and horizon problems were the most famous of those problems and the best part which added to the standard model and completed it was the inflationary scenario .",
    "inflation is a short period at very early stages of the history of the universe in which the universe experiences a very rapidly accelerated expansion and the scale factor parameter @xmath0 grows by many order of magnitude . in terms of how the scale factor varies with time one can classify inflationary models to for example power law inflation @xmath1 , exponential inflation @xmath2 and intermediate inflation @xmath3 . among different models of inflation ,",
    "the one has not been investigated greatly is the logamediate inflation in which for @xmath4 the scale factor behaves as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants .",
    "one can check that for the case @xmath8 the model reduces to the power law inflation .",
    "the logamediate inflation can be extracted from some scalar - tensor theories which naturally give rise these solutions @xcite and also from a new class of cosmological solutions with indefinite expansion which result when weak general conditions apply on the cosmological models @xcite .",
    "although these models belong to a class of models called non - oscillating models that can not naturally bring inflation to an end , but different approaches such as curvaton scenario can be used to do this duty @xcite .    on the other hand , the kind of the scalar field which plays the role of the inflaton field is also important .",
    "the standard scalar field is the most usual one , but some other fields can also be responsible for it . among them , the tachyon field is of particular interest @xcite,@xcite .",
    "its equation of state parameter varies between 0 and -1 and thus it can be a good choice for the inflaton field @xcite@xcite . also it has been shown that the tachyon field can play the role of dark sectors of the universe @xcite@xcite and even at the same time derive inflation and then behave as dark matter or non - relativistic fluid @xcite .",
    "tachyonic inflation is a special case of k - inflationary models in which the inflaton field starts its evolution from an unstable maximum when @xmath9 and finally approaches zero when @xmath10 .",
    "the concept of logamediate inflation with tachyon field or without it has been analyzed in the literature .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the dynamics of the logamediate inflation in the presence of a standard scalar field and its consistency with observational results has been shown in details . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have been investigated the warm - logamediate inflationary universe in both weak and strong dissipative regimes and obtained the general conditions which are necessary that the model to be realizable .",
    "also , in @xcite , the warm - logamediate inflation in the presence of the tachyon field as the inflaton has been analyzed only in high dissipative regime and the results have been compared by the observations .    in this work",
    "we are trying to use the tachyon field as the inflaton in the logamediate inflationary scenario .",
    "our aim is to obtain the influence of the tachyon field on logamediate inflation in comparison with @xcite and also to fill the gap between the articles noted above . in the next section",
    ", we will apply tachyon field in a logamediate inflationary model under slow - roll conditions .",
    "section iii .",
    "deals with perturbation theory . at this section",
    "we will calculate all the perturbation parameters which are needed to have a comparison with observations .",
    "the numerical comparisons have been done in the subsection a. section iv deals with how realistic is our model . at the end , there is a conclusion section in which we will discuss our results .",
    "we start with the field equations in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe @xmath11 and @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the hubble parameter , @xmath14 is the scale factor and the dot means derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath15 . here , we have used units such that @xmath16 . also , we assume the matter content of the universe is a scalar field , @xmath17 , so - called inflaton where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent its energy density and pressure , respectively and they satisfy the following conservation equation @xmath20    from now on we consider the inflaton field as a tachyon field where its energy density and pressure given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the tachyonic scalar potential . substituting ( [ rophi ] ) in ( [ conservation ] ) we reach to the equation of motion of the tachyon field @xmath23 where @xmath24 . also , using ( [ fried ] ) , ( [ conservation ] ) and",
    "( [ rophi ] ) , one can obtain @xmath25    considering the logamediate inflationary model in which the scale factor @xmath0 behaves as ( [ scale ] ) , one can obtain the exact solution of ( [ phidot ] ) as @xmath26 also using ( [ fried ] ) , ( [ rophi ] ) and ( [ phidot ] ) the potential of the inflaton field can be obtained as @xmath27    to have a long enough period of inflation we need to our inflaton field rolls slowly down its potential . in this scenario which is called slow - roll inflation the energy density of the inflaton field and its potential satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "thus in our model , under slow - roll conditions i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 , equations ( [ fried ] ) and ( [ field ] ) reduce to @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "also , the tachyonic potential ( [ v(t ) ] ) becomes @xmath33 there are a few dimensionless parameters in slow - roll inflationary models called slow - roll parameters . in terms of our model parameters",
    "they can be written as @xmath34 and @xmath35.\\ ] ] one can check that the slow - roll parameter @xmath36 starts to increase at @xmath37 , reaches to a maximum at some value @xmath38 and then returns and approaches zero as @xmath39 .",
    "if we pay attention to those cases in which the maximum value of @xmath36 is greater than one , we can choose @xmath40 as the beginning condition of inflation .",
    "for these cases ( @xmath41 ) , one can obtain a constraint for our model parameters as below @xmath42    we can also obtain the number of e - folds between two different values @xmath43 and @xmath44 for this model as @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath43 represents the time in which inflation begins .",
    "although studying a homogeneous and isotropic universe model is sometimes very useful , we know that in a real cosmology there are deviations from homogeneity and isotropic assumptions .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the perturbation theory in our model .",
    "we believe that inhomogeneities grow with time due to the attractive feature of gravity and thus we can say that they were very smaller in the past . because of the smallness of them we can use linear perturbation theory . but as it appears from einstein s equations and to have a more realistic investigation we need a relativistic perturbation theory , i.e. a perturbed inflaton field in a perturbed geometry .",
    "so we start by the most general linearly perturbed flat frw metric which includes both scalar and tensor perturbations as below @xmath46dx^idx^j,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the scalar metric perturbation and @xmath51 is the transverse - traceless tensor perturbation .",
    "a very useful quantity in characterizing the properties of the perturbations , is the power spectrum .",
    "first of all , we calculate the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath52 , which appears in deriving the correlation function of the inflaton field in the vacuum state . for the tachyon field this parameter is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xcite . applying slow - roll approximation in ( [ prtachyon ] ) and using equations ( [ efffried ] ) and ( [ efffield ] ) , one can obtain @xmath55    when someone deals with perturbation in cosmology a few special parameters have to be identified .",
    "the first one is the scalar spectral index @xmath56 which is related to the scalar power spectrum via the relation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 @xcite . with attention to definition of @xmath52 in the slow - roll approximation",
    ", we reach to @xmath59 the second interesting parameter is the running in the scalar spectral index parameter @xmath60 , which has been indicated by one - year to seven - years data set of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and can be obtained via @xmath61 . thus with attention to ( [ ns ] ) one can reach to equation below @xmath62    so far we have only studied the scalar perturbations . but how about tensor contributions ?",
    "in fact the primordial gravitational waves are these tensor perturbations where are essentially equivalent to two massless scalar fields .",
    "thus , the power spectrum of tensor perturbations can be written as @xmath63    the third special parameter we deal with is the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath64 which by definition and using equations ( [ power - scalarper ] ) and ( [ power - tensorper ] ) becomes @xmath65      although we could not obtain a straight relation between @xmath64 and @xmath56 , we can numerically illustrate some trajectories in the @xmath66 plane , if we fix our model parameters @xmath67 and a. since in logamediate inflationary model we only have a lower limit for @xmath67 , so we chose the values @xmath68 to have a general comparison with the work @xcite . in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) ,",
    "we have plotted four curves related to these values of @xmath67 where in each case we have fixed the second model parameter a arbitrarily as they satisfy the condition ( [ alambda ] ) . the solid yellow , dash black , dash - dot green and long dash red curves are related to the combinations ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath72 ) , respectively .",
    "it appears that the main difference between using a standard scalar field in a logamediate inflationary model @xcite and a tachyonic field in it , is that in the latter , transition from @xmath73 to @xmath74 starts at smaller values of @xmath67 in comparison to the former .",
    "we should mention that these curves have been plotted for as large as possible values of a satisfying ( [ alambda ] ) and if we choose some smaller values , then the curves move to the left .",
    "thus , for the cases with @xmath75 we can find some combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) that in which the curves behave as a harrison - zeldovich spectrum , i.e. @xmath76 . in figure ( [ fig:2 ] )",
    ", the dash - dot green and long dash red curves are related to the combinations ( 20 , 2@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , 5@xmath77 ) , respectively .     for different combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) .",
    "they have been compared with the five - years ( blue regions ) and seven years ( red regions ) data set of wmap . in each case",
    "the contours show 68% and 95% confidence regions @xcite .",
    "the solid yellow , dash black , dash - dot green and long dash red curves are related to the combinations ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath72 ) , respectively .",
    "transition from @xmath78 to @xmath75 takes place at smaller values of @xmath67 in comparison to @xcite.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     for different combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) .",
    "they have been compared with the five - years ( blue regions ) and seven years ( red regions ) data set of wmap . in each case",
    "the contours show 68% and 95% confidence regions @xcite . the dash - dot green and long dash red curves which indicate a nearly harrison - zeldovich model are related to the combinations ( 20 , 2@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath79 ) , respectively .",
    "the solid blue line , has been plotted for the combination ( 60 , 3@xmath80 ) and shows an upper bound for @xmath67 in which the model is exiting the observational data . for larger values of @xmath67",
    "the model will be consistent with the data if we decrease enough other model parameter a.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    also , in figures ( [ fig:1 ] ) and ( [ fig:2 ] ) the trajectories have been compared with 68% and 95% confidence regions from observational data , i.e. five - years ( blue - contours ) and seven - years ( red - contours ) wmap data set , which have been defined at @xmath81 mpc@xmath69 @xcite . according to these observational data , an upper limit for @xmath64 has been found .",
    "this upper bound from five - years wmap data set is @xmath82 whereas for seven - years data a stronger limit has obtained as @xmath83 . in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) , the trajectories related to the combinations ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath72 ) , enter seven - years 95% confidence region at @xmath84 and 0.43 , respectively . on the other hand , we can obtain the number of e - folds related to each one of these values of @xmath64 .",
    "one can do this work numerically by first calculating when @xmath40 which is the condition of beginning of inflation in our model and then replacing it in ( [ nume - fold ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation with ( [ r ] ) gives the values of @xmath85 and 13 , respectively .",
    "these values are proportional to the time spent by the tachyon field in the region of the @xmath66 plane allowed by the data and in each case our model is viable for larger values of the related @xmath86 .    the solid blue line in figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) indicates the case in which we have considered the combination ( 60 , 3@xmath80 ) that it means for @xmath87 , the model tends to exit our observational contours unless we decrease the value of a much more .",
    "figure ( [ fig:3 ] ) shows the dependence of the running of the scalar spectral index on the scalar spectral index parameter to lowest order for some combinations .",
    "again the solid yellow , dash black , dash - dot green and long dash red curves are related to the combinations ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath72 ) , respectively .",
    "these curves have been compared with the contour plots from seven - years wmap data set @xcite in which the negative values have been preferred .",
    "seven - years data set implies that in models with only scalar fluctuations the marginalized value for the parameter @xmath60 is approximately -0.034 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "also , it is obvious from this figure that for the combination ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) the model does not show any running in the scalar spectral index , at least in the lowest order .     for different combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) .",
    "they have been compared with the five - years wmap data set in two cases with and without considering tensor contributions . in each case",
    "the contours show 68% and 95% confidence regions .",
    "the solid yellow , dash black , dash - dot green and long dash red curves are related to the combinations ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath72 ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "as noted in introduction , tachyonic potential has a special behavior .",
    "it starts from an unstable maximum at @xmath9 and along its evolution @xmath88 until it approaches zero when @xmath10 .",
    "these are some motivations from string theory . to see how well - motivated is our model potential in ( [ effv(t ) ] )",
    ", first we derive @xmath89 from ( [ scale ] ) as @xmath90.\\ ] ] now , using ( [ phidot ] ) we obtain @xmath91 at late times , one can neglect the second term in parenthesis above and consider @xmath92 .",
    "but , integrating does not give us a good result .",
    "assuming @xmath93 and @xmath94 one can obtain @xmath95\\ ] ] and using this , we can not get @xmath96 , explicitly .    in another approach , assuming @xmath97 in ( [ phidot2 ] ) , one can integrate and reach to the explicit function @xmath98 and substituting this into ( [ effv(t ) ] ) give us @xmath99 .",
    "although this form of potential is of interest but the thing we need is behavior of @xmath96 and since we can not relate two functions @xmath17 and @xmath100 so we can not establish @xmath96 even approximately .",
    "so , we chose numerical approach to show how our model is realistic .",
    "we can do this using ( [ phit ] ) , @xmath99 and @xmath101 . also , to do this we should fix some of our model parameters such as @xmath102 and @xmath67 . in figure ( [ fig:4 ] )",
    "we have shown @xmath96 for all combinations of @xmath103 which we have used in figures ( [ fig:1 ] ) and ( [ fig:3 ] ) , i.e. ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) , ( 10 , 5@xmath70 ) , ( 20 , 4@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , 10@xmath104 ) .",
    "it is obvious from these plots that the general conditions for the string theory tachyon field which noted above are satisfied .",
    "indeed , we can say that our model potential is a well - motivated tachyon potential and the model under consideration is realistic .",
    "also , we can see that increasing in @xmath67 leads to more smooth behavior of @xmath96 .     for different combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) , up - left:(2 , 10@xmath69 ) , up - right:(10 , 5@xmath70 ) , bottom - left:(20 , 4@xmath71 ) and right:(50 , 10@xmath104 ) .",
    "all necessary conditions for a tachyonic potential have been satisfied , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   for different combinations of ( @xmath67 , a ) , up - left:(2 , 10@xmath69 ) , up - right:(10 , 5@xmath70 ) , bottom - left:(20 , 4@xmath71 ) and right:(50 , 10@xmath104 ) .",

    "all necessary conditions for a tachyonic potential have been satisfied , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in this work we studied the logamediate inflation in the presence of tachyon field . in the slow - roll approximation we derived the effective tachyon potential and the slow - roll parameters .",
    "also , the number of e - folds which indicates how long inflation takes , was obtained .    starting with a perturbed line element we investigated our model in the context of perturbation theory .",
    "we calculated some important parameters such as scalar spectral index @xmath56 , its running @xmath60 and tensor to scalar ratio @xmath64 in our model .",
    "then , we plotted some curves for different combinations of our model parameters ( @xmath67 , a ) and compared them with some observational data . from graph",
    "@xmath66 we concluded that our model is in a good agreement with observations for different combinations of the model parameters such as from ( 2 , 10@xmath69 ) to ( 60 , 3@xmath80 ) .",
    "also , one can find some combinations that result harrison - zeldovich spectrum , i.e. @xmath105 , for example ( 20 , 2@xmath71 ) and ( 50 , @xmath79 ) .    in the last section we investigated whether our model and specially the resulting tachyonic potential is realistic or not .",
    "we could not do this analytically but numerical discussion was useful .",
    "in admissible combinations of @xmath103 which we have used in this article , we could show that the general conditions of a tachyon potential are satisfied in our model .",
