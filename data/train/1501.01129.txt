    "the main goal of this work is to provide an introduction to the article of h. hironaka [ h.61 ] .",
    "it concerns the construction of a holomorphic ( in fact `` algebraic '' ) family of compact complex manifolds parametrized by @xmath0 with the following property .",
    "for all @xmath3 the fiber is projective , but the fiber at the origin in not khler ( it is however a moishezon manifold ) .",
    "this famous example serves to show that large deformations of projective manifolds may not be khler .",
    "+ the central fiber of the said family is quite complicated and one may wonder if it is not possible to simplify the construction , so as to understand better the reason why the khler property may disappear in large deformations . a possible candidate for the central fiber",
    "is the simpler example of non khlerian moishezon manifold , also due to h. hironaka , see section 5 .",
    "we will explain here the reason why it is not possible to obtain , with an analoguous construction , a family whose fiber at @xmath2 is this precise simpler example .",
    "+ it was not our intention to present here a complete proof of hironaka s construction .",
    "instead , we have rather detailed some particular points of the original article which in our opinion are not `` explicit '' enough for a `` generic '' reader , although they are well known to specialists . in the same spirit , of helping the reader to gain some intuition about the geometry of the family obtained , we have tried to draw a few two - dimensional pictures in the appendix ( revealing many - dimensional phenomenons ... ) . +",
    "this article is organized as follows : after giving a rough idea of hironaka s construction in section 1 we recall some basic properties of the blow - up of a coherent ideal which will be useful later on . in section 3",
    "we will prove a technical result , which plays a key role in a glueing procedure used in the construction .",
    "the properties of the central fiber of the family are further analyzed in section 4 : we show e.g. that this variety is smooth ",
    "it is one of the delicate points of [ h.61 ] , and that it is not khler .",
    "we remark that there are simpler examples of non - khler manifolds than the central fiber mentioned above , and thus it may be tempting to try use them in order to obtain non - projective fibers as large deformations of projective manifolds . in section 5",
    "we explain why it is not possible to do so , at least for the class of non - khler 3-folds we consider here . + we conclude by exhibiting in section 6 a non - khler moishezon manifold containing two disjoint smooth curves such that the blow - up of any of them is projective .",
    "this example shows that the fact that this manifold is not khler can not be `` localized '' .",

    "the initial point of h. hironaka s article is to consider in the @xmath4dimensional complex projective space @xmath5 the three curves given in the homogeneous coordinates @xmath6 by the following equations ( see picture 4 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a parameter .",
    "+ note that for @xmath9 these three smooth curves ( a line and two conics ) has two common points @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for @xmath12",
    "the conic @xmath13 still contains @xmath14 but not @xmath15 .",
    "in fact @xmath14 is the only common point between @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath12 , as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "+ we first blow - up the ideal corresponding to the union @xmath20 in @xmath21 . the central fiber of the family we will construct is obtained by a glueing procedure starting from the resulting ( projective ) variety , as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be an affine open set , and let @xmath23 be the corresponding inhomogeneous coordinates .",
    "the next step is to blow - up the ideal @xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the affine set @xmath27 ; it turns out that on the intersection @xmath28 , these two operations agree . as a consequence",
    ", we can modify the first ( globally defined ) blow - up of @xmath21 along @xmath29 in such a way that the resulting manifold denoted by @xmath30 will coincide with the second blow - up in @xmath25 .",
    "we will show that @xmath31 is not khler , so in particular it is not projective .",
    "this is proved by showing that there exists an effective curve in @xmath31 which is homologous to zero ( cf .",
    "the end of section 3 ) .",
    "we remark , however , that @xmath30 is a modification of the projective space @xmath5 .",
    "next we will perform a similar construction with the parameter @xmath8 in order to produce an holomorphic family of compact complex manifolds over @xmath0 such that the fibers over @xmath12 are projective but the fiber over @xmath2 ( which is the previously constructed @xmath31 ) is not khler .",
    "this second step is performed by using basically the same procedure , simply by adding the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "on @xmath32 we will replace the inhomogeneous coordinates @xmath33 on @xmath34 by @xmath35 and then follow the same line of arguments as in the absolute case : + the map @xmath36 is a local holomorphic change of variables near the origin in @xmath37 , so the blow - up of the ideal @xmath38 obtained from @xmath39 by changing @xmath33 in @xmath40 gives a family parametrized by @xmath8 of smooth complex manifolds with fiber @xmath41 for @xmath9 .",
    "+ we check in details the smoothness of @xmath41 in the section 4 .",
    "+ the projectivity of the fibers over @xmath12 is deduced from the fact that the corresponding manifold ( built after glueing ) can be obtained directly by blowing up a coherent ideal in @xmath42 .",
    "+ we give an example in section 5 where an analogous construction `` in family '' do not give the expected fiber at @xmath9 and this explains why three curves are needed through the point @xmath14 in hironaka s example . +",
