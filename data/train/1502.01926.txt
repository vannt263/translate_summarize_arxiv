    "finite polar spaces ( of which finite classical polar spaces are a subclass ) , are the natural geometries for the finite classical simple groups .",
    "the main geometric property of polar spaces , as shown by buekenhout and shult @xcite , is the so - called _ one or all axiom_. a polar space is a point - line geometry with the property that if @xmath1 is a point and @xmath2 a line not incident with @xmath1 , then @xmath1 is collinear with either all points of @xmath2 or with exactly one point of @xmath2 .",
    "polar spaces are some of the most important examples in the theory of incidence geometries and provide a rich class of spherical buildings .",
    "we will be interested in finite classical polar spaces which arise from equipping a finite vector space with a sesquilinear or quadratic form , and they are the only finite polar spaces of rank at least @xmath3 @xcite .    according to dembowski ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote page 48 ) , an _ ovoid _ of a projective space is defined for the first time by tits in @xcite , where tits began his introduction with reference to the works of barlotti and segre ( @xcite and @xcite ) on arcs and caps of finite projective spaces .",
    "the connection with polar spaces is due to tits geometric construction of the suzuki groups @xmath4 ( see also @xcite ) , where tits ovoids can also be realised in a second sense , as _ ovoids _ of a particular finite classical polar space ( i.e. , rank @xmath5 symplectic spaces ) .",
    "furthermore , the ree groups @xmath6 can also be naturally constructed from ovoids of a certain family of finite classical polar spaces ( i.e. , rank @xmath3 parabolic quadrics ) . in 1974 , j. a. thas @xcite synthesised these objects as ovoids of finite polar spaces ; a set @xmath7 of points such that every generator meets @xmath7 in exactly one point .    to use the words of j. a.",
    "thas @xcite , ovoids of finite polar spaces have  many connections with and applications to projective planes , circle geometries , generalised polygons , strongly regular graphs , partial geometries , semi - partial geometries , codes , designs \" . in @xcite , the existence and non - existence of ovoids of finite polar spaces was first investigated , and a striking pattern emerges when one looks to the known examples : the existence of ovoids of finite polar spaces simulates the results of tits for ovoids of projective spaces .",
    "that is , ovoids seem to exist only when the rank of the geometry is small .",
    "shult @xcite all but conjectures that if a finite polar space of rank @xmath8 possesses an ovoid , then @xmath9 .",
    "thas @xcite showed that this property holds true for the symplectic and elliptic polar spaces , but also for hermitian polar spaces in even dimension .",
    "the best known bounds on ovoids of hermitian spaces and hyperbolic quadrics are due to blokhuis and moorhouse @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath10 is prime and @xmath11 , there are no ovoids of @xmath12 when @xmath13 . thus for @xmath14 or @xmath15 , we see that no ovoids exist for @xmath16 .",
    "cooperstein @xcite gave another proof that @xmath17 has no ovoids for @xmath18 even by relating the existence of an ovoid in the quadric to the maximum size of a cap in a symplectic polar space .",
    "we give a geometric proof for the non - existence of ovoids of @xmath19 , @xmath18 even ( section [ sec : q+9 ] ) , that utilises a direct parity argument in the hyperbolic quadric .    for hermitian spaces @xmath20 in projective spaces of odd dimension , moorhouse @xcite proved that no ovoids exist when @xmath21 again , this bound implies that for @xmath16 , @xmath20 has no ovoids if @xmath22 . using a combinatorial argument in an inductive way",
    ", klein @xcite proved that no ovoid of @xmath20 can exist for @xmath23 , which although not as powerful as the moorhouse bound , has a simpler proof and provides greater insight into the existence of ovoids of hermitian spaces . using a particular tight set we provide a stronger induction base for klein s argument , that improves his bound to @xmath24 ( section [ sec : aklein ] ) .",
    "the only result known for the non - existence of ovoids of hermitian polar spaces with rank less than @xmath25 is the theorem of de beule and metsch @xcite that @xmath26 has no ovoid .",
    "we provide a proof for the non - existence of ovoids of @xmath26 ( section [ sec : h54 ] ) based on the use of particular intriguing sets .",
    "the method employed in @xcite relies on the characterisation of ovoids in @xmath27 , whereas our proof observes a parity argument within @xmath28 .",
    "hence our proof opens the way for further investigation into the existence of ovoids of @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "throughout , we will use the symbol @xmath18 for a prime power @xmath31 , @xmath10 prime and @xmath32 , and we will denote the the finite field of order @xmath18 as @xmath33 .",

    "the witt index of the form @xmath38 determines the the dimension of the subspaces of maximal dimension contained in @xmath39 ; the _ rank _ @xmath39 equals the witt index of its form , and the ( projective ) dimension of generators will be one less than the witt index .",
