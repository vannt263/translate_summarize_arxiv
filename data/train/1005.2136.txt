    "@xmath0sr experiment , spin - polarized positive muons are implanted one at a time into a sample . each muon spin precesses around the local magnetic field until the muon decays into a positron , which is preferentially ejected along the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay ( as well as two neutrinos which are not detected ) . in the presence of a vortex lattice , the spatial variation of the magnetic field distribution results in a dephasing of the muon spin polarization and a relaxation of the precession signal .",
    "a fourier transform of the spin polarization function essentially reveals the field distribution which exhibits a characteristic abrikosov lineshape . the lineshape ( or equivalently the relaxation function in the time domain ) depends on the lattice geometry , magnetic field penetration depth @xmath4 , coherence length , @xmath20 , and the amount of lattice disorder . as a result",

    "such measurements demonstrated the presence of gap nodes characteristic of d - wave pairing in high quality single crystals of yba@xmath3cu@xmath21o@xmath22@xcite .",
    "in ceramic samples this anisotropic lineshape is generally not observed , rather the broadened line is generally well described by a gaussian distribution ; however , the width of this distribution ( the gaussian relaxation rate ) @xmath23 has been shown to be proportional to the superfluid density divided by the effective mass @xmath24@xcite .",
    "previous studies of cuprates found that extrinsic effects in ceramics can result in the correct temperature dependence of the superfluid density being masked ; for this reason , reliable measurements of the superfluid density require the use of single crystals and the observation of an anisotropic lineshape characteristic of a vortex lattice .",
    "high quality single crystals of ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath25as@xmath3 with x=0.061 , 0.074 , 0.107 and 0.114 were grown at ames from self flux as described in detail elsewhere@xcite .",

    "the crystals , each of roughly 1  @xmath28 area , were mounted in a helium gas flow cryostat on the m20 surface muon beamline at triumf , using a low background arrangement such that only positrons originating from muons landing in the specimens were collected in the experimental spectra .",

    "all of the the fourier transform lineshapes are consistent with a triangular vortex lattice ; for example , a square lattice would have the frequency corresponding to the most likely field ( the peak of the lineshape ) much more separated from the minimum field in the field distribution .",
    "we analyzed the data by fitting the spectra to an analytical ginzburg - landau model which allows us to calculate theoretical @xmath0sr time spectra as a function of the vortex lattice geometry , magnetic field penetration depth ( @xmath4 ) and coherence length ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we included the effects of vortex lattice disorder in our analysis via an additional gaussian broadening of our @xmath0sr spectrum@xcite , where we assumed that this broadening was proportional to @xmath29 as observed in previous studies of cuprates and other high @xmath30 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the errors quoted in various fit parameters included the correlations between the various parameters .",
    "the fit parameters were fairly weakly correlated since the effect of each parameter on the relaxation function is reasonably unique : the penetration depth affects the overall linewidth , the coherence length affects the high field cutoff while disorder gives an overall broadening of the various van hove singularities in the lineshape .",
    "consistent with our previous measurements of ba(fe@xmath8co@xmath31as@xmath3 @xcite , we found that the rms deviation of the vortex positions @xmath32 relative to the vortex separation was greatest in lower fields ( up to 30% in 0.02  t at low temperature ) and smallest at the highest fields ( about 2% in 0.1  t ) and decreased with increasing temperature .",

    "<S> we report muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) measurements of single crystal ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 and sr(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 . from measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath4 we find that for optimally- and over - doped samples , @xmath5 varies monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath6 . within the superconducting state we observe a positive shift in the muon precession signal , likely indicating that the applied field induces an internal magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the induced field decreases with increasing doping but is present for all co concentrations studied . </S>"
