    "when a parton propagates through a nuclear matter , the average transverse momentum may be broadened because of multiple scattering of the parton .",
    "nuclear dependence of such broadening provides an excellent probe to study qcd dynamics beyond the single hard - scattering picture .",
    "reliable calculation of multiple scattering in qcd perturbation theory requires to extend the factorization theorem @xcite beyond the leading power .",
    "qiu and sterman showed that the factorization theorem for hadron - hadron scattering holds at the first - nonleading power in momentum transfer @xcite , which is enough to study double scattering processes in hadronic collisions . according to this generalized factorization theorem , the double scattering contribution can be expressed in terms of universal four - parton ( twist - four ) correlation functions .",
    "the predictions of the multiple scattering effects rely on the accurate information of the four - parton correlation functions .",
    "various estimate of the size of these four - parton correlation functions were derived recently @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that jet broadening in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( dis ) can be used as an independent process to test the previous estimate of the four - parton correlation functions .",
    "the four - parton ( twist-4 ) correlation functions are as fundamental as the normal twist-2 parton distributions . while twist-2 parton distributions have the interpretation of the probability distributions to find a parton within a hadron , four - parton correlation functions provide information on quantum correlations of multi - partons inside a hadron .",
    "just like normal twist-2 parton distributions , multi - parton correlation functions are non - perturbative .",
    "qcd perturbation theory can not provide the absolute prediction of these correlation functions .",
    "but , due to factorization theorems , these correlation functions are universal ; and can be measured in some processes and be tested in other processes .",
    "luo , qiu and sterman ( lqs ) calculated the nuclear dependence of di - jet momentum imbalance in photon - nucleus collision in terms of nuclear four - parton correlation functions @xcite ,    @xmath1    and @xmath2    by comparing the operator definitions of these four - parton correlation functions and the definitions of the normal twist-2 parton distributions , lqs proposed the following model @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 with @xmath5 are the normal twist-2 parton distribution of a nucleon , and @xmath6 is a free parameter to be fixed by experimental data . using the fermilab e683 data on di - jet momentum imbalance , lqs estimated the size of the relevant four - parton correlation functions to be of the order @xmath7",

    ", the drell - yan data favor the four - parton correlation functions about five times smaller than what was extracted from the di - jet data .",
    "this discrepancy may result from different higher order contribution to the drell - yan @xmath9 and the di - jet momentum imbalance .",
    "we have pure initial - state multiple scattering for the drell - yan process , while pure final state multiple scattering for a di - jet system .",

    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the high order contribution to the drell - yan nuclear enhancement is important . meanwhile , it is also important and necessary to find different observables that depend on the same four - parton correlation functions .",
    "the jet broadening in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering provides an independent test of the size of the four - parton correlation functions . at the leading order in deeply inelastic scattering , a quark scattered of the virtual photon forms a jet ( known as the current jet ) in the final state . because of the multiple interaction when the scattered parton propagates through the nuclear matter",
    ", the transverse momentum of the final state jet is broadened in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering @xcite . we show below that the size of the jet broadening is directly proportional to the four - parton correlation functions .",
    "these four - parton correlation functions are the same as those appeared in the nuclear enhancement of the di - jet momentum imbalance .",
    "current data for the di - jet momentum imbalance and the drell - yan @xmath10 provide two different sizes of the four - parton correlation functions . using these data , without additional parameters , we predict a range of the jet broadening in dis",

    "as we will demonstrate explicitly , the inclusive cross section @xmath31 has much weaker nuclear dependence after integration over the whole momentum spectrum .",
