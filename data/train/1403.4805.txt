    "it is well known that einstein s theory of gravity , i.e. general relativity , can not be consistently quantized with the rules developed in the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "using perturbation theory around a flat metric , the ultraviolet divergences require infinitely many counter - terms .    thus , it is natural to consider theories in which a natural minimal length is imposed . with the lessons from quantum theory , where a minimal volume element in phase space is introduced",
    ", one could imagine introducing noncommuting coordinates to generate a minimal volume element in space - time .",
    "this is the idea of noncommutative geometry , which by now is mathematically well developed and whose physical applications is the subject of this workshop .",
    "what is still lacking is a concrete idea how to use this formalism to formulate a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "in fact noncommutative geometry has mainly been employed for applications to generalized gauge theories , like the noncommutative standard model of connes - lott @xcite .",
    "another approach to introduce a minimal length is by postulating that the fundamental physical objects are extended so that their interaction also violates the principle of locality .",
    "certainly , the most prominent example is string theory , for which the existence of gravity is a direct consequence and which contains infinitely many new ultraviolet degrees of freedom , namely all the higher oscillation modes of the string , making the string theory on - shell feynman diagrams finite .    the question is whether the above mentioned two approaches are related or maybe even complementary to each other . since string theory is by far better developed , one can approach this question by looking for the appearance of noncommutative target - space structures in both open and closed string theory . for the open string there",
    "exists a well established relation , namely open strings ending on a d - brane supporting a non - vanishing two - form ( gauge flux ) see a noncommutative d - brane world - volume geometry .",
    "in fact , as shown by seiberg - witten @xcite one can describe in a certain limit the effective theory on the brane as a noncommutative gauge theory .",
    "then , the star - product in witten s open string field theory @xcite is directly related to the moyal - weyl star - product for functions on the target space .    during the recent years",
    "there have been some attempts to reveal similar noncommutative structures in closed string theory @xcite . as will be explained in this course , in this case",
    "the analysis is far more subtle and seems to be obscured by the limitation of only having available a background dependent formulation of string theory .",
    "that means that the background satisfies the string equations of motion , which by definition are the constraints for conformal invariance of the sigma model action .",
    "there are certain indications that the closed string is related to the appearance of not only noncommutative but even nonassociative target space geometries .",
    "it is fair to say that the precise relation is still not completely settled , but a couple of interesting observation have been reported .    in this mini - course a pedestrian introduction into the appearance of noncommutaitve geometry in both the open and the closed string sector is provided .",
    "it is aimed not for specialists in string theory but rather for people interested in noncommutative geometry .",
    "this is why the course starts at a considerable basic level .",
    "moreover , a partial overlap with the already existing proceeding article @xcite could not be avoided .",
    "in this section , let us introduce some basic material of the bosonic closed and open string .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to those aspect which will become relevant in the course of this lecture .",
    "for more details and derivations we refer the reader to the existing text books @xcite .",
    "* aspects of closed string world - sheet theory *    the usual approach to string theory is in a first quantized version , i.e. one considers a string moving in a target space background with metric @xmath0 , kalb - ramond field @xmath1 and dilaton @xmath2 , whose dynamics is governed by a two - dimensional non - linear sigma model . with @xmath3 denoting the world - sheet of the closed string , its action reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the minkowski world - sheet metric and we suppressed the dilaton part . here",
    "the coordinate fields depend on the word - sheet coordinates @xmath6 and satisfy the boundary condition @xmath7 for closed strings .",
    "choosing for instance the simple background of a flat metric @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the 2d equation for motion is simply the wave equation @xmath10 .",
    "introducing light - cone coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , this becomes @xmath13 .",
    "its solution splits into left and right moving waves @xmath14 with the mode expansion @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the center of mass position and @xmath17 the center of mass momentum operator of the closed string .",
    "one also defines @xmath18 .",
    "the modes satisfy the commutation relations @xmath19=\\eta^{ab}\\ , m\\ , \\delta_{m ,-",
    "n}\\ , , \\qquad    [ \\overline\\alpha_m^a,\\overline\\alpha^b_n]=\\eta^{ab}\\ , m\\ , \\delta_{m ,- n } \\ , ,",
    "\\qquad    [ \\alpha_m^a,\\overline\\alpha^b_n]=0 \\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] thus , one can define the modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 as raising operators and the positive modes as lowering operators .",
    "the hilbert space is then given by the fock - space of the two algebras acting on a ground state @xmath23 with @xmath24 subject to the level matching constraint @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the left and right moving occupation numbers .",
    "the target space mass of such a state is given by @xmath27 .",
    "for utilizing the powerful methods of complex analysis , one wick rotates the world - sheet into euclidean signature and defines @xmath28 . from the commutator algebra",
    "one can compute the two - point function as @xmath29 for each state in the hilbert space @xmath30 , there exist a corresponding field @xmath31 , where the correspondence is determined via @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , the ground state tachyon of mass @xmath33 and momentum @xmath34 corresponds to the field ( vertex operator ) @xmath35 with @xmath36 . at the first excited level one finds the on - shell vertex operator @xmath37 with @xmath38 and transverse polarization ,",
    "i.e. @xmath39 . for symmetric polarization this is the graviton / dilaton and for anti - symmetric one the kalb - ramond field .",
    "the tree level closed string scattering amplitude for @xmath40 such on - shell vertex operators is defined as @xmath41 where we included the universal contribution from the ghosts and already implemented the effect of the @xmath42 invariance , which allows to move the first three points to three fixed ones @xmath43 .",
    "the most common choice is @xmath44 .",
    "the correlation function below the integral is to be computed in the conformal field theory on the riemann sphere ( compactified complex plane ) .",
    "higher loop amplitudes involve cft correlation functions on higher genus riemann surfaces .",
    "note that in the mode expansion the zero mode part is left - right symmetric .",
    "this changes when one considers the compactication of the string on e.g. a circle of radius @xmath45 in the @xmath46 direction . in this case , starting with the general ansatz @xmath47 , one has quantized kaluza - klein momentum @xmath48 , @xmath49 and quantized winding strings @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath52 this is invariant under the transformation @xmath53 this acts on the left and right momenta as @xmath54 and can be extended to the entire string theory .",
    "thus , closed strings on a circle admit a new type of symmetry , so called t - duality , which acts on the coordinates in a left - right asymmetric way @xmath55 .",
    "* target space equations of motion *    from the computation of string scattering amplitudes one can deduce an effective target space action for the massless modes , i.e. the graviton , the dilaton and the kalb - ramond field .",
    "alternatively , one can start from the non - linear sigma model and require that on - shell backgrounds are given by its conformal fixed points . from the 2d point of view",
    ", the coupling constants are given by the target space background fields .",
    "this quantum field theory is treated perturbatively in a dimensionless coupling @xmath56 , where @xmath45 is a characteristic length scale of the background . at leading order , the beta - function equations for the couplings @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath2 read @xmath59 the first equation , at leading order in @xmath60 ,",
    "is nothing else than einstein s equation with sources .",
    "clearly , in this approach one is assuming from the very beginning that the string is moving through a riemannian geometry with additional smooth fields .",
    "however , it is well known that there exist conformal field theories which can not be identified with such simple geometries",
    ". these are left - right asymmetric like for instance asymmetric orbifolds .",
    "the latter are asymmetric at some orbifold fixed points but one can imagine asymmetric cfts which are not even locally geometric .",
    "we will see that the target space interpretation of such asymmetric cfts is closely related to noncommutative geometry .",
    "* aspects of open strings *    now consider open strings with @xmath61 .",
    "such open strings can end on d - branes carrying in general a non - vanishing gauge flux @xmath62 on their world - volume .",
    "one extends the non - linear world - sheet sigma - model action to include the gauge fields on the d - branes at the end of the open string world - sheet @xmath63 the action has the abelian gauge invariance of the vector potential at the boundary @xmath64 and the combined two - form gauge invariance of the antisymmetric tensor @xmath1 , which also involves a boundary term , @xmath65 for constant metric @xmath66 , antisymmetric tensor @xmath1 and gauge field strength @xmath67 the action simplifies .",
    "first we notice that , using @xmath68 the term involving @xmath1 can be written as a boundary term . for constant @xmath67",
    "one can also write @xmath69 so that the total world - sheet action becomes @xmath70 therefore , the end points of the open string couple to the gauge invariant field strength @xmath71 the boundary conditions at @xmath72 that follow from the variation of the world - sheet action are @xmath73 for the target space @xmath74 with flat metric @xmath75 and the constant field strength @xmath76 , we obtain the so - called mixed boundary conditions @xmath77 thus , the gauge field interpolates between a neumann boundary condition @xmath78 and a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath79 .    for an open string with either pure neumann or pure dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends , one obtains the following mode expansion @xmath80=\\eta^{ab}\\ , m\\ , \\delta_{m ,-",
    "\\   \\end{split}\\ ] ] thus , relative to the closed string the degrees or freedom are halved .",
    "the open string two - point function for these two cases can be straightforwardly computed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 take values in the complex upper half plane .",
    "now we discuss how t - duality acts in the open string sector . since it exchanges momentum and winding , a t - duality in the @xmath84-direction acts as @xmath85 .",
    "let us consider a d - brane on non - compact @xmath86 , which is shown in figure [ fig_intersect ] .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( -20,56)@xmath87 ( 0,50)@xmath84 ( -58,108)@xmath88    the d - brane intersecting the @xmath84-axis under an angle @xmath87 provides the following boundary condition for an open string @xmath89 applying a t - duality in the @xmath88-direction , these boundary conditions become @xmath90 these are precisely of the mixed type so that we can identify @xmath91 . under t - duality in the @xmath88- direction a @xmath92-brane at angle",
    "is mapped to a magnetized @xmath93-brane .",
    "moreover , a ( left - right symmetric ) rotation of the @xmath92-brane by an angle @xmath87 @xmath94 is mapped under t - duality to a left - right asymmetric rotation defined as @xmath95 thus we summarize that left - right asymmetric symmetries of the world - sheet act in the open string sector via changing the magnetic flux on the brane .",
    "that noncommutative geometry is related to open string theory has long been suspected .",
    "for instance , in witten s cubic open string field @xcite the fundamental product between two string fields is noncommutative , though still associative and cyclic .",
    "expanding the theory around the flat background with vanishing kalb - ramond field , this noncommutativity is not visible in the zero mode sector , i.e. the target space coordinates are still commutative .",
    "however , by turning on a background which is sensitive to the order of two end - points of an open string , one has a chance to also make manifest the noncommutativity in the zero mode sector .",
    "as we will derive in this section , such a background is given by a constant @xmath96 flux .",
    "mathematically this means that for non - vanishing @xmath96 the two disc correlators shown in figure [ fig_discs ] are different . in the following",
    "we will compute this amplitude using the methods presented in the previous section and which were introduced in @xcite .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( -146,60)@xmath97 ( -35,60)@xmath97 ( -197,8)@xmath98 ( -118,8)@xmath99 ( -83,8)@xmath100 ( -7,8)@xmath101 ( -108,50)@xmath102 ( -90,30)@xmath103    we are still working on a two - dimensional flat target space and recall the two - point function on the upper half plane for nn boundary conditions @xmath104 in the second line we have split the two - point function so that , formally using @xmath105 we can directly read off the individual contributions from the left- and right - movers . according to our previous discussion , we can turn on a non - vanishing constant flux by performing an asymmetric rotation .",
    "a straightforward computation leads to the following expression for the propagator in the rotated coordinates @xmath106 using @xmath107 we can write this as @xmath108 finally , restricting this to the real axis , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and choosing the branch cut of the logarithm in the second line of along the negatively imaginary axis one obtains @xmath111 here @xmath112 for @xmath113 positive and @xmath114 for @xmath113 negative .",
    "note that the second term is not symmetric under exchange of @xmath115 and @xmath116 and therefore is the source of noncommutativity .",
    "this expression agrees precisely with the propagator derived in @xcite with the identification of the open string metric @xmath117 thus , by applying an asymmetric rotation we have found an elegant and short way of deriving this propagator .",
    "this relation of the open and closed string quantities can be compactly written as @xmath118    using the correlator , one can compute the operator product expansion of open string tachyon vertex operators at the boundary @xmath119 the extra phase is independent of the word - sheet coordinates and can therefore be considered as a target - space effect .",
    "indeed , this phase can be considered to arise due to a noncommutative deformation of the product of functions on the target space , namely from the moyal - weyl star - product @xmath120 this noncommutative product satisfies a couple of properties :    1 .   for the coordinate functions",
    "@xmath121 and @xmath122 it leads to the star - product commutator @xmath123_\\star = i\\,\\theta^{ab}$ ] , the defining relation of the moyal - weyl plane .",
    "the star - product is associative @xmath124 .",
    "this is consistent with the associativity of the operator product expansion in conformal field theory .",
    "actually , in cft one requires crossing symmetry of correlation functions , which implies the weaker constraint of associativity up to boundary term , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "it is also cyclic in the sense @xmath126 and similarly for cyclic permutations of the product of @xmath40 functions .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the conformal @xmath127 symmetry group leaves the cyclic order of the inserted vertex operators invariant .",
    "so far we considered the most tractable case of a constant background flux in flat space , but mathematically the star - product was defined in @xcite for an arbitrary poisson structure @xmath128 . in this case",
    "the corresponding star - product is still associative .",
    "however one can also consider the same product for only a quasi poisson structure , which then leads to a nonassociative star - product ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "physically , also in this most generic situation , as long as the background satisfies the string equations of motion , i.e. for an on - shell background , the properties 1.-3 .",
    "above should still be satisfied .",
    "following essentially @xcite , let us confirm this for the first non - trivial order terms .",
    "now we have the physical situation of an open string ending on a d - brane with generic non - constant @xmath129-field , i.e. non - vanishing field strength @xmath130 supported on a brane embedded in some generically curved space . at leading order in derivatives",
    "this leads to a noncommutative product @xmath131 where the first line is just the expansion of the moyal - weyl product .",
    "the associator for this product becomes @xmath132 with @xmath133}$ ] , which by definition vanishes for a poisson tensor .",
    "this can be written as @xmath134 where we used the bianchi identity @xmath135 .",
    "for a slowly varying gauge field , the effective action is given by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action @xmath136 varying it with respect to the gauge potential @xmath137 in @xmath138 , one gets the equation of motion @xmath139^{[\\underline{ab}]}\\right ) = { 1\\over 2\\pi\\alpha'}\\partial_a\\left ( \\sqrt{g+2\\pi\\alpha'{\\cal f } } \\ , \\theta^{ab}\\right)=0   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have used .",
    "then , it directly follows that up to leading order in @xmath140 the @xmath141-product satisfies cyclicity @xmath142 indeed , e.g. at order @xmath143 the difference between the left and the right hand side is a total derivative on - shell @xmath144 thus , as expected from cft , the product of two functions is cyclic , once the background satisfies the string equations of motion .",
    "similarly , the associator below the integral also gives a total derivative at leading order in @xmath140 @xmath145 thus , we conclude that , as expected from the open string conformal field theory , on - shell ( up to @xmath146 ) the @xmath141-product is associative up to boundary terms . our argument seems to suggest that it might be relevant for string field theory in off - shell backgrounds , but to our knowledge this has not been made explicit .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that noncommutativity arises for open strings in a magnetic flux background leading to noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "clearly , if noncommutative geometry has any significance for improving the ultraviolet behavior of quantum gravity , it should also appear for closed strings .",
    "thinking about this question , one realizes that the closed string analogue must be different as here two vertex operators are inserted in the bulk of a two - sphere @xmath147 and no unambiguous ordering of @xmath148 and @xmath149 can be defined .",
    "therefore , one does not expect the same kind of noncommutativity to arise .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig_sphere1 ] , adding one more point might improve the situation . just looking at the @xmath147 geometrically ,",
    "@xmath148 and @xmath149 define a geodesic . then adding @xmath150 one can distinguish the two situation that it lies on the same or opposite hemisphere as the point @xmath97 . then following the open string logic , turning on a three - vector flux @xmath151",
    "distinguishing these two configurations can make this tri - product structure manifest .",
    "thus , in this case one would e.g. expect a fundamental non - vanishing tri - product of the form @xmath152 which allows to define a totally antisymmetric tri - bracket @xmath153=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in s_3 } { \\rm sign}(\\sigma ) \\ ;         f_{\\sigma(i)}\\ , { \\hspace{1.5pt}\\triangle\\hspace{1.5pt}}\\ ,   f_{\\sigma(j)}\\ , { \\hspace{1.5pt}\\triangle\\hspace{1.5pt}}\\ ,   f_{\\sigma(k ) } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath154 denotes the permutation group of three elements .",
    "however , there is a caveat to this simple picture , namely that in string theory one has to take into account the conformal @xmath42 symmetry of the world - sheet , .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_sphere2 ] , this allows to map the three points @xmath148 , @xmath149 and the north pole to @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , i.e. they do lie on the same geodesic .",
    "therefore , adding @xmath150 does not lead to any clearly distinguished order .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in cft a four - point function can be expressed in terms of the @xmath42 invariant cross - ratio and features crossing symmetry .",
    "the latter is nothing else than associativity of the operator product expansion .",
    "clearly , with these insights one could stop at this stage .",
    "however , since these ideas have the potential to be a window into off - shell string theory or at least into structures present in theories beyond the usual approach to string theory , let us proceed and investigate how precisely the two features 1 . and 2 .",
    "above are realized in closed string theory .",
    "first we will clarify what the nature of the three - vector flux @xmath151 might be .",
    "in fact in the study of nongeometric fluxes , precisely such a candidate appeared , the so - called @xmath45-flux . since the appropriate framework for describing it is double field theory we will also present some of its structure . for a more detailed presentation",
    "we refer the reader to the review articles @xcite",
    ".        in closed string theory there generically exists a massless kalb - ramond two form , whose field strength @xmath159 is a three - form . at first sight , this seems to be the natural candidate for @xmath151 . whereas a constant two - form flux on a d - brane only slightly changes the boundary conditions of the open string , due to , a constant @xmath130-flux really backreacts on the geometry and also implies that the underlying exact cft is not any longer free but becomes highly interacting .",
    "therefore , this situation is much harder to analyze .",
    "however , the @xmath130-flux is not the only candidate for a source of nonassociativity .",
    "applying t - duality to the closed string background @xcite given by a flat space with constant non - vanishing three - form flux @xmath159 , results in a background with geometric flux .",
    "this so - called twisted torus is still a conventional string background , but a second t - duality leads to a nongeometric flux background .",
    "these are spaces in which the transition functions between two charts of a manifold are allowed to be t - duality transformations , hence they are also called t - folds @xcite . after formally applying a third t - duality , not along an isometry direction anymore , one obtains an @xmath45-flux background which does not admit a clear target - space interpretation .",
    "it was proposed that this background does not correspond to an ordinary geometry even locally , but instead gives rise to a nonassociative geometry @xcite .",
    "therefore , this nongeometric flux seems to be the prime candidate for @xmath151 .",
    "as mentioned , for the last t - duality giving @xmath45-flux one can not apply the buscher rules . during the last years",
    "a formalism was developed which allows to precisely perform such t - dualities .",
    "this is called double field theory ( dft ) and is a field theory for the massless modes of the bosonic string which has manifest @xmath160 symmetry .",
    "a full introduction into this fast developing subject is beyond the scope of this lecture and we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "here we just give a very few ingredients which allow to perform the series of t - dualities mentioned above .",
    "the main idea is that one doubles the coordinates @xmath161 by introducing so - called winding coordinates @xmath162 .",
    "this allows to put the diffeomorphism symmetry and the @xmath129-field gauge transformations on equal footing by combining the dynamical fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a generalized metric @xmath163 the global @xmath164 symmetry acts as @xmath165 one can construct an @xmath160 invariant action for this generalized metric , where eventually one halves the degrees of freedom by imposing the so - called strong constraint @xmath166 where @xmath167 denote the fundamental objects in dft like @xmath168 and gauge parameters .    in order to see how t - duality is described in this framework",
    "consider a flat torus @xmath169 with a constant @xmath130-flux with @xmath170 .",
    "the generalized metric then takes the form - flux , the following computation can be found in the appendix of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath171 a t - duality in the @xmath172 direction is a special @xmath160 transformation and acts via conjugation @xmath173 with the matrix @xmath174 one gets @xmath175 which corresponds to the metric @xmath176 on the twisted three torus with vanishing @xmath129-field .",
    "thus , this background is characterized by a constant geometric flux @xmath177 .",
    "second , let us perform a t - duality in the isometric @xmath178 direction .",
    "the generalized metric transforms as @xmath179 with @xmath180 reading off the metric and the b - field , we find @xmath181 due to the terms in the denominators , this looks a bit awkward . however , in generalized geometry and dft one can also parametrize the generalized metric via @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes an anti - symmetric bi - vector . the geometric frame and",
    "this nongeometric one are related via the field redefinition @xmath184 which is reminiscent of the buscher rules and the open string relation . using this frame",
    "one gets the simple result @xmath185 then one defines the nongeometric @xmath186 flux as @xmath187 so that this background has a flat metric @xmath188 and a constant @xmath186-flux .    thus , we have established a chain of t - duality transformations @xmath189 where we have indicated the final step , namely the result of performing a t - duality also in the non - isometric @xmath190 direction . we note that , according to the @xmath160 action for @xmath191 , the normal and winding coordinate are exchanged as @xmath192 so that @xmath193 then one defines the nongeometric @xmath45 flux as @xmath194}=h\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] therefore , this flux explicitly involves winding derivatives and is not visible in ordinary geometry .",
    "now , we will analyze the conformal field theory for a closed string moving on a flat space with a constant @xmath130-flux background .",
    "the aim is to perform a similar computation as for the open string , i.e. in particular to compute @xmath40-point functions of tachyon vertex operators . but before we can do that , we need to define a cft .",
    "the essential observation is that a ricci flat metric , vanishing dilaton and a constant @xmath130-flux solves the string equation of motion up to linear order in @xmath130 . since we are interested in a linear order effect , it is appropriate to perform conformal perturbation theory up to linear order in @xmath130 around the trivial background . therefore , the starting point is a flat metric and a constant @xmath130-flux specified by @xmath195 where for simplicity we focus on @xmath196 . as said ,",
    "the expectation is that this background corresponds to a cft up to linear order in @xmath130 . moreover , since the origin of t - duality lies in conformal field theory where it is nothing else than an asymmetric reflection @xmath197 , one can try to analyze the @xmath45-flux case also from the cft point of view .",
    "the remainder of this article is essentially a brief version of the more exhaustive analysis originally presented in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite .    to proceed , we write the action as the sum of a free part @xmath198 and a perturbation @xmath199 . choosing a gauge such that @xmath200 , we have @xmath201 we expect @xmath202 to be a marginal operator ( only ) up to linear order in @xmath130 .",

    "one can also compute the correction to the two - point function of two coordinates .",

    "it is just a reflection of the right - moving coordinates .",

    "we are now interested in momentum modes in the r - flux background which are related via t - duality to winding modes in the @xmath130-flux background .",

    "in the free theory the tachyon vertex operator is a primary field of conformal dimension @xmath234 , and in covariant quantization of the bosonic string physical states are given by primary fields of conformal dimension @xmath235 .",

    "the three - tachyon amplitude for a permutation @xmath242 of the vertex operators can be computed using the relation @xmath220 . with @xmath243 for the @xmath130-flux and @xmath244 for the @xmath45-flux , one finds @xmath245    \\bigl\\langle { \\cal v}_1\\ ,   { \\cal v}_2\\ ,   { \\cal v}_3   \\bigr\\rangle^{h / r } \\;,\\ ] ] where in addition @xmath246 for an odd permutation and @xmath247 for an even one .",
    "one observes that for @xmath130-flux the phase is always trivial while for @xmath45-flux a non - trivial phase may appear .",
    "recall that our analysis is only reliable up to linear order in @xmath151 .",
    "note that it is non - trivial that this phase is independent of the world - sheet coordinates , which can be traced back to the form of the fundamental identity of @xmath248 .",
    "for this reason , it can be thought of as a property of the underlying target space .",
    "indeed , the phase in can be recovered from a new three - product on the space of functions @xmath249 which is defined as @xmath250 however , in cft correlation functions operators are understood to be radially ordered and so changing the order of operators should not change the form of the amplitude .",
    "this is known as crossing symmetry and is also called the associativity of the operator product expansion . in the case of the @xmath45-flux background , this is reconciled by applying momentum conservation leading to @xmath251 therefore , scattering amplitudes of three tachyons do not receive any corrections at linear order in @xmath252 both for the @xmath130- and @xmath45-flux .    the tri - product can be generalized to more generic functions as @xmath253 where we used the notation @xmath254 .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath255-product and can be thought of as a possible closed string generalization of the open string noncommutative structure . for the tri - bracket of the coordinates",
    "@xmath256 one gets @xmath257 = 3\\pi^2\\ , \\theta^{abc}$ ] .",
    "this result generalizes to the @xmath40-tachyon amplitude , where the relative phase can be described by the following deformed product @xmath258\\ ,      f_1(x_1)\\ , f_2(x_2)\\ldots     f_n(x_n)\\bigr|_{x } \\ ; ,   \\ ] ] which has the peculiar feature that the phase becomes trivial after taking momentum conservation into account or equivalently @xmath259 we conclude that for constant closed string @xmath45-flux , a non - vanishing tri - product and is consistent with the main axioms of a conformal field theory . below the integral",
    "it only gives boundary terms and therefore does not change the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , we have identified a non - trivial nonassociative deformation of the underlying target space , which is not visible in cft . whether this deformation is `` real ''",
    "can only be decided , if one goes beyond conformal field theory , i.e. the usual perturbative approach to string theory .",
    "some simple ideas in this direction will be discussed in the following final part of this lecture .",
    "when the lecture was given , the question arose what happens for non - constant @xmath252-flux and whether it helps to decide about the relevance of this entire approach .",
    "thus , the question is how the open string analysis from the end of section [ sec_open ] generalizes to the closed string .",
    "since nongeometric fluxes are appropriately described in double field theory ( dft ) , the analysis should be performed in this framework .",
    "this was indeed done in @xcite . for self - consistency of this lecture , here we will not work in the most general dft setting but instead present some of the essential results in a simplified form .    for the open string",
    ", it happened that both cyclicity and associativity hold up to boundary terms precisely if the string equations of motion were satisfied for the background .",
    "let us consider the tri - product of three functions below an integral on a manifold with curved metric @xmath0 @xmath260 performing an integration by parts for the second term , we get @xmath261 which gives a boundary term for @xmath262 this is precisely the leading order equation of motion for the @xmath130-flux , i.e. for @xmath263 .",
    "therefore , for such a tri - product , its effect at linear order ( nonassociativity described by a tri - bracket ) gives a boundary term .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this behavior also holds for a doubled flux @xmath264 which includes also the gravitational part .    however , this is actually _ not _ the flux , for which the tri - product appeared in the cft .",
    "there , we argued that it is the @xmath45-flux , i.e. @xmath265 , which by itself is already an anti - symmetric three - vector so that no metric factors are involved .",
    "therefore , in this sense such a tri - product is rather of topological type and should involve bianchi identities instead of equations of motion . in @xcite this was shown to be essentially correct in the dft framework . however , in dft the @xmath160 symmetry requires that with @xmath266}$ ] the complete tri - product takes the form @xmath267 employing the strong constraint between @xmath268 and the @xmath269 , the entire second term on the right hand side vanishes and the tri - product becomes trivial .",
    "thus , in dft one can only get a non - trivial tri - product if the strong constraint is weakened .",
    "a more elaborate discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "this reflects the status of the emergence of nonassociativity in closed string theory and it is fair to say that this issue is still not completely settled and more work is needed to put together the bits and pieces that were revealed so far .",
