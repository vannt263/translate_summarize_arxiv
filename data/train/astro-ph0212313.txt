    "ultraviolet spectra of o and b stars ( with luminosities up to @xmath0 and surface temperatures @xmath1 ) show the signatures of rapidly expanding winds , with velocities on the order of a few @xmath2 , densities of order @xmath3 , and mass - loss rates up to @xmath4 .",
    "these stars are detected to have soft - x - ray luminosities of @xmath5 times their total ( bolometric ) luminosities.@xcite in cooler stars , like the sun , x rays are produced in coronae , which are high - temperature regions near the surface of the star , and their x - ray line widths are primarily indicative of thermal broadening .",
    "the line widths observed in x - ray spectra of hot stars , however , provide evidence that the emission originates in extended , high - velocity winds .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has the spectral resolution to resolve doppler - broadened lines from hot stars , providing quantitative information about the geometry and kinematics of the wind and putting important constraints on physical models that may explain the observed x rays .",
    "_ chandra _ uses a set of concentric parabolic and hyperbolic mirrors with an effective area of about @xmath6 to focus x rays on its instrument package .",
    "the medium energy grating ( meg ) provides a resolution of @xmath7 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) .",
    "an optically - thin , spherically - expanding , x - ray - emitting plasma produces symmetric line profiles centered on the rest wavelengths of the lines with a shape determined entirely by the velocity and emissivity structure of the plasma .",
    "two effects can change the symmetry of the line .",
    "the star itself occults part of the plasma , while cold components of the wind absorb x rays , meaning photons traveling along longer lines of sight or through more dense wind regions will be less likely to reach the observer . in a radially expanding wind ,",
    "the observer sees blue - shifted emission from the approaching material on the near side of the wind and red - shifted emission from the receding material on the far side .",
    "thus an optically thick wind has the effect of removing photons from the red side of the profile , shifting the line center blueward and altering the shape of the line .",
    "owocki and cohen @xcite have numerically integrated a spherically - symmetric wind model to determine the shape of line profiles produced in a wind characterized by four parameters . the wind velocity at a distance @xmath12 from the center of the star is assumed to be of the form @xmath13 ( a `` @xmath14 velocity law '' ) , where @xmath15 is the stellar radius , @xmath16 is the terminal velocity of the wind ( determined from ultraviolet spectra ) , and @xmath14 is a free parameter of order unity . given a constant mass - loss rate , the density at any point in a smoothly - expanding , spherically - symmetric wind can be determined from the velocity law .",
    "the emissivity of the wind is taken to be zero below some radius @xmath17 , and to fall off like @xmath18 above that , where @xmath19 is the density of the wind and @xmath20 is a free parameter .",
    "the optical depth of the wind is characterized by the parameter @xmath21 , which is defined so that , in a constant velocity wind ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , @xmath21 is the radial optical depth at the surface of the star and the radius of optical depth unity is @xmath24 .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath20 , @xmath17 , and @xmath21 offer enough flexibility to characterize a variety of physical models , including coronal models ( by setting @xmath20 and @xmath14 to high values and @xmath25 ) .",
    "all lines produced in an extended wind of this form will be skewed to the blue side of line center by the removal of photons from the red edge of the profile .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of the star @xmath26 puppis @xcite reveal broad lines with a significant blueward skew , suggesting an extended , spherical wind model may be able to explain the shape of the profiles .",
    "preliminary work on fitting the owocki and cohen model to lines in @xmath26 puppis suggest that good fits may be obtained with physically reasonable parameters .",
    "figure [ robanpic ] ( a ) shows the _ chandra _ meg ( sum of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 order ) spectrum of the @xmath29 ne x lyman @xmath30 line of @xmath26 puppis along with the best - fit line profile .    other hot stars",
    ", however , show much more symmetric profiles .",
    "figure [ robanpic ] ( b ) shows the same ne x line of @xmath31 orionis c along with the model that fit the line in @xmath26 puppis .",
    "no spherically - symmetric wind model that includes absorption can fit the relatively narrow and symmetric line from this star .",
    "a promising alternative to spherically - symmetric models is the magnetically confined wind shock ( mcws ) model in which a strong ( kg ) , large - scale dipole magnetic field originates from the star s surface and directs the stellar outflow .",
    "this field directs the wind toward the magnetic equator , where flows from opposite hemispheres collide , causing strong shocks and heating the wind plasma to @xmath32 k. this theory , originally proposed by babel and montmerle , lately has gained currency due to the direct detection of an 1100 g field on @xmath33 orionis c @xcite and the detailed magnetohydrodynamic modeling by ud - doula and owocki .    as an initial exploration of this model , we have numerically synthesized emission line profiles of equatorial x - ray - emitting flows . in figure [ stephpic ]",
    "we show the results of a simple model based on a radially directed flow confined to the magnetic equator of a hot star ( using a @xmath14 velocity law , with the flow confined to within 20 degrees of the equator ) . because stellar magnetic fields are often tilted with respect to the rotation axis , our viewing orientation changes with rotation phase . in the figure",
    "we show a simulated line profile from three different angles : 0 degrees ( magnetic pole - on ) , 45 degrees , and 90 degrees ( equator - on ) .",
    "the characteristics of these profiles are due to ( the changing ) projected radial velocity of the x - ray - emitting wind , as well as ( viewing - angle dependent ) occultation by the star .",
    "clearly , the rotation phase can affect the line profiles , which is a conclusion we will be testing against recently obtained multi - phase chandra observations of @xmath33 orionis c itself .",
    "this star has a 45 degree angle between the magnetic and rotation axes @xcite , and a viewing angle that is also tilted by 45 degrees with respect to the rotation axis , giving us a full range of viewing angles with respect to the star s magnetic axis .",
    "future modeling work will include the effects of absorption by the cold wind and also take into account more realistic and complex flow morphologies , including spectral post processing of numerical mhd simulations .",
