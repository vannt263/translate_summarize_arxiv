    "but under these weaker assumptions , ( i ) and ( iii ) hold on a zariski dense open subset .",

    "( i)(iii ) hold in some important cases , e.g. , for polarized @xmath8 surface of genus @xmath33 ( in which case the moduli stack is usually denoted by @xmath34 , is of dimension @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for any @xmath13 , cf.,e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "moduli spaces exist also for polarized enriques surfaces ( cf.@xcite ) and degenerations of ( polarized ) enriques surfaces are also studied ( cf.e.g .",

    "the precise result for @xmath54 is the following :    [ thm : mappamod]let @xmath47 be the universal severi variety over the moduli space @xmath34 of polarized @xmath8 surfaces @xmath20 of genus @xmath33 . for @xmath54 and @xmath55 one",

    "( a ) kemeny s result is stronger in the sense that he may weaken the assumptions on @xmath44 for infinitely many @xmath33 s .    the proofs in @xcite , although different , both rely on studying the fibers of the moduli map on curves on _ special _ @xmath8 surfaces .",
    "kemeny s proof is inspired by ideas of @xcite , and uses appropriate curves on @xmath8 surfaces with high rank picard group .",
    "the approach in @xcite is by specialization to a reducible @xmath8 surface in a partial compactification of @xmath61 and therefore uses an extension of the moduli map to an appropriate partial compactification of the severi variety containing reducible curves , with target space @xmath62 .    in the present paper",
    "we want to present a different approach to the aforementioned general problem .",
    "this approach relies on two different techniques .",
    "firstly , it is based on the analysis of first order deformations of pairs @xmath63 as in @xcite . the strategy in @xcite , which requires assumption [ ass : sevvaruniv ] ,",
    "was originally introduced for polarized @xmath8 surfaces and for @xmath54 , but can be easily adapted to @xmath64 and to the case where the canonical bundle is not necessarily trivial ( cf . also ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1(ii ) ) ) .",
    "the upshot is the following . in the above setting ,",
    "take @xmath65 and set @xmath66 . arguing as in @xcite , the differential @xmath67 of @xmath68 at @xmath2 can be identified with a suitable cohomology map ( the @xmath69 in ( * ? ? ? * ( 4.21 ) ) ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath70 is the blowing - up of @xmath25 at @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the strict transform of @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the tangent bundles of @xmath25 and @xmath72 respectively , then @xmath76 moreover , by the serre duality theorem and leray isomorphism , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of thm ( 5.1 ) ) ) , one has that @xmath77 _ by summarizing , if @xmath2 belongs to a component @xmath7 of @xmath78 , the map @xmath79 is @xmath80 finally , the vanishing of @xmath81 is equivalent to generic finiteness of @xmath79 if @xmath82 . _",
    "unfortunately , the vanishings are , in general , not so easy to be proved , even if one assumes @xmath83 ( cf .",
    "this is where the second tool of our approach enters the scene ( see  [ s : logcomplex ] ) . in order to prove the above vanishings",
    ", we propose to use degenerations .",
    "we assume in fact that the surfaces in @xmath0 and nodal curves on them possess good semistable degenerations with limiting surfaces that are reducible in two components ( the more general case of reducibility in more components could be treated , but , for simplicity , we do not dwell on this here )",
    ". then we look at the _ limits _ of the relevant cohomology spaces .",
    "the latter are driven by the so  called _ abstract log complex _",
    "( see @xcite ) . using this we arrive at sufficient conditions for the vanishings in to hold , expressed in terms of cohomological properties of suitable sheaves of forms on the two components of the limit surface ( cf .",
    " [ ss : degdiff ] ) .",
    "these properties are hopefully easier to prove than the vanishings in , since these components are simpler than @xmath25 .",
    "the results are summarized in proposition [ thm : main ] , which is the main result of this note .    in the rest of the paper ( i.e.   [ s : k3case ] and [ sec : lemma ] ) we test our approach in the ( known ) case of @xmath8 surfaces for @xmath54 , giving a new proof of theorem [ thm : mappamod ] .",
    "we do not claim that this is easier than the proofs in @xcite , but it works quite nicely and gives good hopes to fruitfully apply the same method in other unexplored cases , like the ones mentioned at the end of remark [ rem : casi ] .",
    "we also mention that the approach of this paper can be applied to the @xmath84 case ( using a slightly different degeneration , namely the one in @xcite ) , but we leave this out as the bounds we obtain depend linearly on @xmath37 and are thus considerably weaker than the bounds in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the present approach gives the same result as @xcite for @xmath54 , the analysis of this case in @xcite is finer ( as it studies the family of degenerate @xmath8s on which the curves in the fibers of the moduli map live ) and is needed in the proof of the @xmath84 case .",
    "thus , the approach in this paper can not replace the proof of the @xmath54 case in @xcite .",
    "we work over @xmath85 . for @xmath86",
    "any gorenstein , projective variety , we denote by @xmath87 and @xmath88 the structural and the canonical line bundle , respectively , where @xmath89 is a canonical divisor .",
    "we denote by @xmath90 and @xmath91 the tangent sheaf and the sheaf of @xmath92-forms on @xmath86 , respectively . for @xmath93 any closed subscheme , @xmath94 ( or simply @xmath95",
    "if @xmath86 is intended ) will denote its ideal sheaf whereas @xmath96 ( same as above ) its normal sheaf .",
    "we use @xmath97 to denote linear equivalence of divisors .",
    "we often abuse notation and identify divisors with the corresponding line bundles , using the additive and the multiplicative notation interchangeably .",
    "finally , we use the convention that if @xmath98 is a sheaf on a scheme @xmath86 and @xmath93 is a subscheme , then @xmath99 is the image of the restriction map @xmath100 .",
    "the first three authors have been supported by the gnsaga of indam and by the prin project `` geometry of projective varieties '' , funded by the italian miur .",
    "in this section we will provide a tool for proving the vanishings of the cohomology groups occurring in by degeneration of the surface and semicontinuity .",
    "the main results are summarized in proposition [ thm : main ] below .",
