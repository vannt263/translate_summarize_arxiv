    "even if there were a sufficient supply of @xmath16 remnant bhs which grew via gas accretion at the eddington rate with 10% radiation efficiency , it would have taken them at least @xmath17yr to reach @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this timescale barely matches the available time required to make bright qsos at @xmath19 .",
    "such efficient growth by accretion is unlikely , for two reasons .",
    "first , population iii stars in the vicinity of the seed , and the bh progenitor itself , ionize the surrounding matter , causing expansion of the hii region and likely suppression of subsequent accretion onto the smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the possible supernova explosion of a popiii star can evacuate the ambient gas in the vicinity of the seed .",
    "this suggests that mergers must play an essential role in growing smbhs from population iii seeds , but this is difficult as well .",
    "according to the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , dark matter ( dm ) halos frequently merge in hierarchical structure formation .",
    "however , too frequent halo mergers would result in the formation of small @xmath20-body systems of bh seeds , which would be prone to smbh slingshot ejection(s ) from the dm halo .",
    "given the relatively short time available for growing smbh seeds to quasar masses , the long list of delaying processes can seriously hurt the popiii seed scenario .",
    "an appealing alternative is that early smbhs formed via direct collapse of the halo gas at @xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the direct collapse paradigm assumes that an smbh seed , @xmath22 , forms from the cold halo gas .",
    "this process favors a high density , high inflow rate environment in which star formation is suppressed . a massive central object  a supermassive star ( sms ) , forms at the center of the collapsing region .",
    "this object is powered by a combination of core nuclear burning and kelvin - helmholtz contraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the stellar core collapses and forms the smbh seed , its convective envelope is powered by the accretion onto this seed  this configuration is termed a quasistar .",
    "consequently , the seed bh , @xmath23 at the beginning , can grow to @xmath24 in less than a few myrs .    in this context ,",
    "constraints on the accretion rate onto the smbh become weaker , and additional problems anticipated in the popiii seed scenario do not play a major role . in order to make this scenario work",
    ", the gas needs to inflow rapidly from @xmath25kpc to @xmath25100au scales .",
    "the most probable site for such runaway gas collapse is expected in dm halos with virial temperatures @xmath26k .",
    "if the halo gas can cool only via atomic cooling , the necessary condition for the collapse to be triggered is for the gas temperature to be lower than the virial temperature of the host dm halo .",
    "however , two caveats to the direct collapse scenario must be addressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , the angular momentum barrier , in principle , can terminate the collapse well before it reaches @xmath27au scales .",
    "owing to angular momentum conservation , collapse is halted when the rotational velocity reaches the circular velocity . in order to overcome this barrier",
    ", there should be a physical process to redistribute the gas angular momentum outward .",
    "second , gas could fragment during the collapse , depleting the accretion stream by forming gas clumps and ultimately stars .",
    "the gas clumps could also disturb the accretion pattern .    in this paper , we study the physical processes that accompany the initial and intermediate stages of gas collapse in a dm halo .",
    "we focus on the dynamical processes : spontaneous and induced symmetry breaking , nested gaseous bar formation , and the role of supersonic turbulence .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] discusses the relevant processes . in section  [ sec : method ] we describe the numerical setups for a set of simulations intended to quantify these processes , and in section  [ sec : simresult ] we present our results .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "it is generally understood that local viscous transport mechanisms are inefficient on galactic scales .",
    "even on scales of a few parsecs , their characteristic timescales are prohibitively long and angular momentum transport therefore requires nonlocal mechanisms , e.g. , large - scale magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or by gravitational torques .",
    "turbulent motions , e.g. , driven by the gravitational collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other mechanisms , can amplify the seed magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "on larger spatial scales , the angular momentum redistribution most likely depends on long - range gravitational torques ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when angular momentum is conserved , gas collapse is quickly stopped by the centrifugal barrier . prior to collapse within dm halos ,",
    "the gas can exhibit the same angular momentum distribution as the dm .",
    "the typical spin acquired by a halo during maximal expansion is given by a dimensionless parameter @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the halo angular momentum , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are its virial mass and the circular velocity at the virial radius @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mean spin of dm halos is @xmath33 .",
    "if the gravitational potential of the gas dominates , this @xmath34 will bring the gas to a centrifugal barrier when it has collapsed by a factor of @xmath35 . when the dm potential dominates , the collapse will stop after a decade in radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "inflow beyond the centrifugal barrier requires substantial and continuous angular momentum loss by the gas .",
    "what are the options ?",
    "if the gas disk becomes nonaxisymmetric , gravitational torques between the inner and outer gas , as well as between the gas and dm , can drain angular momentum away from the collapsing gas .",
    "the lowest nonaxisymmetric modes , @xmath36 , prevail in both the gas and the dm , because their rise times are shortest .",
    "the @xmath37 mode requires perturbation of the center of mass of the gaseous disk  this is not always possible .",
    "the next fastest growing mode is @xmath38  the bar - like mode .",
    "typically it will have the highest amplitude , in the absence of @xmath37 .",
    "for the inflow to extend to smaller spatial scales , the gas disk must be self - gravitating . under these conditions ,",
    "a cascade of bars can be maintained over a substantial dynamic range in radius .",
    "contraction of the gas via such an avalanche can be related to self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "an analogy can be made between the chaos driven when the bar exceeds a certain strength and a sandpile whose slope is increased until the sand slides off @xcite .",
    "the bar cascade can be triggered in a number of ways .",
    "first , if the disk becomes self - gravitating and cold , its axial symmetry is known to be broken spontaneously when the ratio of bulk kinetic energy to absolute potential energy , @xmath39 , is larger than a certain critical value .",
    "the gas bar exerts torque on the gas disk and transfers angular momentum outward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this process allows the collapsing gas to cross the centrifugal barrier and to continue the collapse to smaller scales , if angular momentum is continuously extracted .",
    "the threshold value for gaseous bar formation depends also on the shape of the gas distribution and is @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath41 for disks and @xmath42 for spheres .",
    "this instability is spontaneous and does not require any trigger  it will grow exponentially from any infinitesimal perturbation .",
    "several additional effects can drive a cascade through finite amplitude perturbations .",
    "first , the shape and dynamics of a self - gravitating gas disk will respond to the potential of the dm halo in which it is embedded .",
    "dm halos are known to be triaxial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore exert gravitational torques on the disk , which will respond with low fourier modes .",
    "second , finite bar perturbations can also be driven by tidal effects of massive dm and baryon clumps , i.e. , halo substructure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from mergers .",
    "in addition , asymmetry in the background gravitational potential can be generated by the spontaneous break of axial symmetry in the collapsing flow , dm , gas or both .",
    "it is well - known that nonradial perturbations can grow in supersonic accretion flows onto compact objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , without any assistance from self - gravity .",
    "gas collapse inside an axisymmetric dm halo is similar  in section  [ sec : collapse ] of the present work , we show the appearance of nonradial perturbations in the equatorial plane of the disk , although we start from idealized conditions of an isolated halo and embedded baryons which possess axial symmetry . in a comprehensive cosmological simulation , all these factors would provide _ finite _ amplitude perturbations that do not require the @xmath43-parameter to cross the threshold .    at the spatial scale on which the gas disk forms , the potential contribution from the gas is already comparable with that of the dm , and the gas cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "these conditions imply that the collapsing gas becomes self - gravitating and nearly isothermal , and the density profile evolves toward a singular isothermal sphere for spherical radii , and @xmath44 for cylindrical radii . ] @xmath45 .",
    "before the gas reaches the centrifugal barrier , we can assume it flows in with the free - fall speed , whose dependence on radius is weaker than logarithmic .",
    "away from the disk and the centrifugal barrier , the gravitational potential is still dominated by the dm , so the accretion rate can be estimated at @xmath46 where @xmath47 for a @xmath48 dm halo , and we used the universal baryon fraction for the gas - to - total mass ratio . at these radii , only the gas participates in the collapse , as the dm is in equilibrium due to the initial conditions .    on the other hand , when the gas dominates the potential , the mass accretion rate is of order @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the gas sound speed and @xmath51 is the viscosity parameter in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we shall see in section  [ sec : collapse",
    "] , this situation in our simulations occurs inside the centrifugal barrier . for _ local _ viscosity in the disk , @xmath52 , but for _ nonlocal _ viscosities , e.g. , magnetic or gravitational torques , @xmath53 , especially in the self - gravitating case where the effective @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "in this latter case , the inflow rate is still given by equation  [ eq : mdot ] , where @xmath55 is the virial velocity of the gravitational potential which is now dominated by the gas , i.e. , @xmath56 in eq .  [ eq : mdot ] .",
    "the inflow velocity will depend on the compactness of the gas distribution and can substantially exceed the virial speed of the dm halo .",
    "a high accretion rate is crucial for the formation of a sms or disk that can develop into an smbh seed .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that an infall rate exceeding @xmath57 yr@xmath58 is necessary in order to form a @xmath59 sms , which has a nuclear burning timescale of only a few million years .",
    "the initial smbh seed of @xmath60 , formed by core collapse of such a star , then grows at a highly super - eddington rate inside the remaining convective envelope ( the ` quasistar ' phase : @xcite ) , reaching @xmath61 or more in less than a few myr .",
    "gas fragmentation can terminate the collapse by consuming the gas supply .",
    "in addition , the clumps formed during fragmentation can excite odd - mode perturbations in the gas disk , damping the bar instability which plays the key role in angular momentum redistribution . in order to continue collapse to very small spatial scales ,",
    "fragmentation should be suppressed .",
    "there are several ways to suppress gas fragmentation .",
    "supersonic turbulence can suppress fragmentation via shocks that sweep the density fluctuations in a crossing time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of supersonic turbulence find that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density fluctuations is lognormal ( i.e. , gaussian in the log ) under a wide range of conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this distribution is the result of @xmath68 being a random variable , which is itself a product of independent random variables .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath69 in the definition of @xmath70 is not a constant and depends on the driving mode of the turbulence .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath71 varies between 1/3 to unity , for solenoidal and compressive driving , correspondingly .",
    "the lognormal density pdf has been observed in simulations of turbulent motions on the scales of giant molecular clouds , where the background ( unperturbed ) density is uniform .",
    "here , we shall test the development of turbulence in collapsing flows with steep preexisting density gradients .    the critical overdensity required for fragmentation",
    "is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the jeans length at the mean density and @xmath74 is the turbulent length scale at which the velocity dispersion reaches the sound speed @xcite . in a supersonic turbulent medium ,",
    "overdensities higher than @xmath75 are unstable to fragmentation .",
    "estimating the mass fraction in jeans - unstable fragments that collapse on a timescale shorter than the free - fall timescale as @xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "if the collapsing gas maintains supersonic turbulence , the amount of fragmenting gas is negligible .",
    "in our models , we have assumed optically thin flows .",

    "* ) , which can be attained at radii @xmath90 pc for the parameters of our models .",
    "other processes , however , are likely to allow the energy in these upscattered ly@xmath43 photons to leak away before they can escape . for one thing , these photons can be absorbed by even small amounts of dust . extrapolating figure18 of @xcite to our column densities ( which can be inferred from the next section )",
    ", we find that a metallicity as low as @xmath91 solar will do the job . an additional process that can destroy the ly@xmath43 photons is the resonant pumping of h@xmath83 , followed by fluorescent decay to vibrational levels .",
    "we note that fragmentation might be avoidable in the presence of supersonic turbulence , even if h@xmath83 is present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this happens because the fraction of fragmenting gas decreases with @xmath67 .    in our simulations",
    ", we assume that h@xmath83 is destroyed and do not analyze its contribution to the gas cooling .",
    "we also neglect magnetic fields and their effects on the turbulent flow , and model gravitational collapse within the dm halo hydrodynamically .",

    "this refinement corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath4au .",
    "the @xcite requirement for resolution of the jeans length , i.e. , at least 4 cells , has been verified . however , the actual resolution of the jeans length in our simulations exceeds this criterion , depending on the distance from the center , because of the baryon density dependence .",
    "specifically , throughout most of the spherical collapse region , @xmath98pc , the jeans length is resolved with @xmath99 cells . between 1  10pc ,",
    "it is resolved by @xmath100 cells , for 0.001  1pc by 10 - 30 cells , and inside 0.001pc by 4 cells .",
    "this estimate is based on the baryon properties only , and ignores the effect of dm . if the latter is taken into account , the jeans length increases by a factor of a few .",
    "therefore , our resolution of the jeans length increases correspondingly .",

    "we simulate this dm halo within a @xmath113 computational domain .    for the dm halo",
    ", we assume an isothermal sphere . this halo model is similar to the universal dm halo model ( nfw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the spatial scales of interest .",
    "the isothermal model also provides a simple analytical form for the velocity distribution function which allows us to generate a live isotropic dm particle distribution that maintains a stable equilibrium with @xmath114 particles .",
    "we introduce a dm core radius , @xmath115 , within which the dm density is approximately constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , @xmath115 plays the role of the king radius for a nonsingular isothermal sphere .",
    "we vary @xmath115 to see the effect of dm halo structure on the development of gas collapse .",
    "in particular , we implement a number of simulations , models a  e , with different dm density core sizes , as given in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the dm halo and the gas have been laid down at virial and pressure ( for the gas ) equilibrium , so no transient adjustment occurs .",
    "the gas halo has a @xmath116 constant density core at the start of the simulations .",
    "the gas , however , instantly cools down from the virial temperature to about 10,000k , and so its pressure support is negligible .",
    "the total gas mass in the halo is estimated from the cosmological baryon fraction , @xmath117 .",
    "the angular momentum of the halo gas is computed from @xmath118 , defined in section  [ sec : theory ] . in large - scale @xmath20-body cosmological simulations",
    ", @xcite has found that the specific angular momentum in dm halos roughly follows @xmath119 , close to a flat rotation curve .",
    "we therefore impose a constant rotation velocity on the gas outside the core , assuming that the rotational axis runs parallel to the @xmath93-axis . for @xmath120 ,",
    "we assume solid body rotation for the gas , i.e. , @xmath121 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outer boundary of the model we smooth the sharp density cutoff at the virial radius by adopting the gas density profile @xmath122 beyond @xmath32 .",
    "we also ran a number of models with modified initial conditions .",
    "one such representative model is discussed as model dmod , i.e. , modified model d , in section  [ sec : modeldmod ] . in this model",
    "we randomized the orientation of the initial angular momentum in spherical shells , keeping the mean - square angular momentum unchanged .",
    "for this to happen , we have slightly decreased @xmath5 of the inner shells and compensated the outer shells by a slight increase in @xmath5 .",
    "this was done in order to mimic cosmological initial conditions , based on the simulations by @xcite , in particular on their figure  19 .    to verify that the dm halo is indeed formed in equilibrium , we tested dm - only models and confirmed their stability , especially in the central region .",
    "additional tests have been run for model b with an isothermal equation of state for the gas ; these show very similar evolution .",
    "we also tested a model with an adiabatic equation of state  the gravitational collapse did not proceed far in this model , as expected .",
    "probably the most intriguing consequence of this argument is the emerging mass range for the smbh seeds .",
    "if a large fraction of the overall inflow goes into formation of the smbh seed , we can extrapolate @xmath123 to obtain the maximal @xmath124 , which is about 10% of the amount of baryons in dm halos of interest , @xmath125 .",
    "so the mass range for smbh seeds appears to be @xmath126 .",
    "if , in addition , the size of the flat dm density core correlates with the halo virial radius , the mass of the smbh seed is expected to correlate with the dm halo mass , at the time of formation .",
    "this also hints at the possible correlation between the dm halo mass function and the smbh seed mass function .",
    "our models relate the properties of smbhs formed through direct collapse to the sizes of the flat density cores of dm halos .",

    "therefore , the size of the dm density core replacing the cusp , strictly correlate with the halo virial radius .",
    "this assumption is probably overly optimistic , and relies heavily on the fragility of the cusp due to its thermodynamic improbability @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that such a correlation will lead to an smbh mass which _ initially _ depends linearly on the dm halo mass . in this case",
    "the smbh seed mass can be inferred from table  [ tab : table3 ] to lie at @xmath127 for a dm halo of @xmath0 and @xmath128kpc , which will have a dm density core of @xmath129pc .",
    "this is close to the upper limit on @xmath9 we have estimated above .",
    "it is tantalizing that this upper limit lies so close to the characteristic _ lowest _ detected mass of the smbhs in galaxies at present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can explain this cutoff . if , however , @xmath115 does not correlate with @xmath32 , the above estimate of an smbh mass range @xmath130 appears to be more realistic .",
    "the above conclusions might be modified if a substantial amount of the collapsing baryons is expelled via some feedback from the sms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or wind mechanism , effectively decreasing the peak accretion below its nominal value of @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , the proposed range of @xmath9 is attributed only to a single cycle in the accretion process , by which we mean one central runaway resulting in the formation of the smbh seed .",
    "the conditions leading to the second cycle will differ because of the existence of the smbh .",
    "however , it is not clear if the mechanical and radiative feedback from this seed will have an effect on the next runaway , i.e. , on the 2nd cycle .",
    "one can envision that the feedback is directed along the rotation axis , while the next central runaway proceeds in the equatorial plane .    finally , we note that while our initial calculations of smbh formation in the direct collapse scenario have emphasized some interesting outcomes , a long list of issues to be resolved remains .",
    "one such issue is whether molecular hydrogen can affect the outcome of this process by inducing fragmentation in the collapsing gas .",
    "nearby stars can contribute to the uv background which have an adverse effect on h@xmath83 formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we assume that the uv background will damp h@xmath83 formation and , therefore , will maintain the gas temperature not much below @xmath132 .",
    "several physical mechanisms have been proposed that can support this state of the gas @xcite .",
    "implementation of radiative transfer calculations to study the details of this process is a next logical step .",
    "we note that @xcite have argued that fragmentation will be suppressed even if the cooling floor moves substantially below @xmath133k .",
    "this happens because the flow becomes much more supersonic and the fraction of fragmenting gas decreases with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "alternatively , if the collapse happens inside more massive halos , the ratio of the virial velocity to the sound speed will increase and lead to the same result .",
    "our results can be compared to some extent with the concurrent works available in the literature , using enzo @xcite and ramses @xcite .",
    "all these works used cosmological initial conditions which provide a more realistic setting for the gravitational collapse , but provide less leverage when studying its detail , and are also more time - consuming , limiting the number of models run .",
    "the outcome of these models agrees generally with our results of rotationally - dominated disks , and turbulence - suppressed or delayed fragmentation .",
    "@xcite , obtains rotationally - supported  cores \" in only 3 out of 19 cases .",
    "this can be simply explained by the maximal resolution of their models limited to 8pc ( but typically larger , e.g. , 14 , 15 and 22pc ) .",
    "at this resolution the disk - like structure , and even the radial shock positioned at the centrifugal barrier , obtained in our simulations would remain unresolved , and the 2nd stage of the collapse will be missed . based on our model dmod ( section  [ sec : modeldmod ] ) , we expect that cosmological initial conditions will lead to the formation of a rotationally - supported disk at somewhat smaller radii than in our models .",
    "this would explain why @xcite missed this runaway stage altogether .",
    "@xcite has imposed a specific subgrid turbulence model of @xcite .",
    "this model has been calibrated against the _ sub_sonic turbulence regime .",
    "we find that the _ super_sonic turbulence regime operates in various places of the dm halo , especially during the 2nd stage of the collapse .",
    "furthermore , @xcite does not consider the role of gravitational torques in the angular momentum transfer during the collapse , while we find it to be of a prime importance , especially when triggering the 2nd stage of the collapse .",
    "their figure  4 clearly exhibits the dominant @xmath38 barlike or spiral mode , and the gravitational torques are expected to play at least some role in the gas inflow . despite these differences in the interpretation , our results broadly agree , especially regarding the product of the collapse  the central disklike configuration .",
    "the same applies to @xcite , who also have concluded that gravitational torques appear as a main mechanism for the angular momentum redistribution in the system .",
    "although our initial conditions have been motivated by the current cosmology framework , they are significantly simplified and idealized .",
    "owing to this simplification , the simulation results can qualitatively demonstrate the physical processes that work but can not quantitatively predict the physical timescales discussed here .",
    "varying the dm halo profile , gas density profiles , and angular momentum distribution can affect the bar formation timescale and the torus fragmentation timescale .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite suggested that early smbhs tend to be formed in halos with a low angular momentum .",
    "it will be interesting to predict the environments of early smbhs formed through direct collapse , using full cosmological simulations with many different halo conditions .",
