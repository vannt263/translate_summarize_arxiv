    "collisional ring galaxies @xcite give us a bright example of star formation induced by radially expanding density waves , which are triggered by a near - axial passage of a companion galaxy through the disk of a target galaxy @xcite .",
    "the expanding density waves in the gas disk of a target galaxy leave behind stellar populations of progressively older age .",
    "this allows us to study the sequence of large - scale star formation events by considering adjacent locations along the galactic radius .",
    "a sequential triggering of star formation by expanding density waves makes collisional ring galaxies a unique laboratory for studying young stellar populations .",
    "the best studied collisional ring galaxy to date is the cartwheel .",
    "star formation in the cartwheel is concentrated in the two rings , which reveal the presence of expanding density waves @xcite .",
    "the non - stationary and propagating nature of star formation is manifested by the current radial expansion of the rings @xcite , radial color gradients @xcite , and radial age distribution of young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the pre - collision cartwheel is still controversial : it might have been either a gas - rich low surface brightness galaxy @xcite or a regular large galaxy @xcite . to identify the types of disk galaxies that can serve progenitors to the collisional ring galaxies",
    ", we should extend the observational and theoretical studies beyond the cartwheel .",
    "the available sample of collisional ring galaxies , i.e. galaxies with an apparent ring morphology and nearby companions , is relatively small .",
    "however , traces of expanding rings and associated star formation can be found in otherwise regular galaxies .",
    "these features include a shift between the peaks of radial distributions of ob - associations and hii regions in m  51 , m  101 , and some other nearby galaxies @xcite , recently discovered ring in ngc  922 @xcite , and ring - like structure in the inner region of m  31 @xcite .",
    "this evidence suggests that head - on collisions with satellites are likely to be a more frequent phenomenon in the local universe than they were previously thought .",
    "this paper is motivated by the fact that propagating waves of star formation are expected to leave behind stellar populations , the ages of which should be characterized by a radial gradient .",
    "this gradient should be imprinted in the absorption spectra measured at different radial distances from the center of a collisional ring galaxy .",
    "we have chosen arp  10 , a galaxy with an apparent ring morphology , because of its large size and convenient location for our observations ( in the northern hemisphere ) . unlike the cartwheel , arp  10 shows clear signs of the old stellar population in the form of elements of spiral arms and prominent bulge .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to study the development of ring structures in regular spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast to previous works @xcite , we considerably improved the spatial resolution of kinematical studies of arp  10 .",
    "we also search for the companion that is presumably responsible for the arp  10 peculiar ring structure .",
    "the new set of observational data allows us to create a self - consistent picture of collision and subsequent star formation in arp  10 .",
    "observations of arp  10 were conducted with the 6-meter telescope at the special astrophysical observatory ( russian academy of sciences ) and multi - mode focal reducer scorpio ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the scorpio allows us to carry out the broad- and narrow - band photometry , long - slit spectroscopy , and scanning fabry - perot spectroscopy .",

    "the h@xmath3 and johnson - cousins b- and r - images were taken on september 21/22 , 2003 .",

    "the mean seeing was 1.6 arcsec .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and flat field , cosmic ray hits , and sky background .",

    "the h@xmath3 image of arp  10 corrected for the continuum and superimposed onto the b - band image is shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "we obtained three long - slit spectra of arp  10 using a 1.0 arcsec wide slit .",

    "the summary of spectral observations including the supplementary information about the spectral range and resolution , corresponding integration times , and position angles of the cuts are given in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the first spectral cut coincides with the major axis of the outer ring in arp  10 .",
    "the second cut is drawn at the position angle 118   and covers a larger spectral range with a lower spectral resolution .",
    "the third cut passes through a small `` knot '' ( presumable satellite - intruder ) at 5 arcsec from the center of the galaxy .",

    "figure  [ f1 ] suggests that the pre - collision arp  10 might have possessed a complicated structure typical for spiral galaxies .",

    "the points in the bottom panel represent a sum of the systematic and vertical components of the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "we note that the rotation curve continues to rise slowly even at large radii ( 50  arcsec , or 32  kpc ) .",

    "the tilted - ring analysis performed for @xmath16 = 22   and @xmath13=0 also implies significant vertical velocities @xmath14 in the vicinity of the inner ring ( see middle and bottom panels in figure  [ f5 ] ) .",

    "note that higher expansion velocities in the outer ring correspond to larger distances from the center .",
    "this implies that different parts of the outer ring has started to expand at the same time and from the same position in the disk , which favors the collisional origin of the outer ring in arp  10 .",
    "the radial variations of the kinematic p.a . in the middle panel of figure  [ f5 ] is a distinctive feature of radial motions , according to @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that we assume that all non - circular motions in the outer ring occur in the galactic plane and the azimuthal component of non - circular velocities is negligible .",
    "strictly speaking , this is true only for the regions that lie at the minor axis ( i.e. regions with p.a .",

    "the vertical and azimuthal components may contribute to the residuals .",
    "the residual velocities in the inter - ring region may achieve rather high values . at the same time , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is quite small there , which makes the interpretation of gas motions in the inter - ring region difficult .    to see how the expansion velocity in the plane of the disk @xmath23 varies along the outer ring , we average @xmath13 over 7 pixel ( @xmath24 5 arcsec ) circular regions , which are regularly spaced along the ring . the resulting distribution of @xmath23 along the outer ring is shown in figure  [ f5.2 ] as a function of angle @xmath17 . here",

    ", we use the h@xmath3/h@xmath27 line ratio .",
    "for the correct extinction and abundance analysis , we have to take the absorption lines into account .",

    "these fluxes at different distances from the center of arp  10 are given in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the extinction in the v - band ( @xmath31 ) from hii regions located at different radii is estimated using the parameterization of @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "the extinction can be determined only in star - forming rings : it attains a mean value of 0.32  mag in the inner ring and increases toward the outer ring , reaching a maximum value of 4.0  mag in the external part of the outer ring .",
    "this is in general agreement with a propagating star formation scenario  massive young stars destroy dust and decrease extinction in the wake of a propagating wave of star formation .",
    "the observed emission fluxes in table  [ t2 ] were corrected for extinction and then were used to evaluate the oxygen abundance in arp  10 . the temperature - sensitive line [ oiii]@xmath304363 is not seen in our spectra .",
    "instead , we follow an approach described by @xcite , which uses the excitation parameter @xmath32 based on the [ oii]@xmath333727,3729 to [ oiii]@xmath334959,5007 relation @xmath34 :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 , @xmath37\\lambda\\lambda3727,3729 }   / i_{h\\beta}$ ] , @xmath38\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007 } / i_{h\\beta}$ ] , and @xmath39 .",
    "the derived abundance of oxygen will be applied in the spectral index modeling in   [ s5 ] .",
    "the shape of absorption spectral lines depends on abundances of heavy elements . in turn , the emission line fluxes ( and hence the extinction and abundances ) depend on the subtracted absorption spectrum . to determine abundances and extinction , we use the following procedure .",
    "we estimate extinction / abundances from emission lines and use the resulting values to derive the model absorption spectrum . the resulting spectrum in turn",
    "is used to derive a new approximation for the emission line fluxes and , by implication , for extinction / abundances .",
    "this procedure is iterated until convergence .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath32 and oxygen abundances 12 + log(o / h ) are given in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "these values agree with a mean value of 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.6 estimated by @xcite for two hii regions in the outer ring of arp  10 .",
    "however , when a method of evaluating oxygen abundances from @xcite is applied to our emission line fluxes , the obtained oxygen abundances exceed the solar value at all radii .",
    "this is unlikely for arp  10 due to its presumably low surface density nature ( see   [ s7.1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the radial oxygen abundance gradient in arp  10 is very small , with a mean oxygen abundance of 8.55 and 8.64 in the inner and outer rings , respectively .",
    "this implies a negligible radial metallicity gradient in young stars as well .",
    "one of the products of our analysis is the radial distribution of extinction - corrected fluxes in h@xmath3 and h@xmath27 , which are shown in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "the h@xmath3 fluxes were corrected for [ nii]-emission by deblending .",
    "we note that the [ nii]/h@xmath3 flux ratio is remarkably constant along the radius of arp  10 .",
    "table  [ t3 ] indicates that [ nii]@xmath306584/h@xmath3 = 0.37 @xmath19 0.01 and ( [ nii]@xmath306548 + [ nii]@xmath306584)/h@xmath3 = 0.48 @xmath19 0.05 .",
    "these values are typical for quiescent regions in regular galaxies rather than for regions where strong shock waves are seen @xcite .",
    "it suggests that propagating gas density waves in arp  10 do not generate strong shock waves .",
    "the equivalent width of absorption lines in galaxies depends on a contribution of stellar populations of different ages . in case of arp  10",
    ", we assume that stellar populations consist of old background stars and young stars .",
    "the latter were born after a passage of a star formation wave associated with an expanding gas density wave .",
    "we apply several population synthesis codes to construct model spectra and estimate the relative amount of old and young stars at a specific radius in arp  10 .",
    "the propagating wave of star formation in arp  10 is approximated by a sequence of single - burst events .",
    "spectra of single - burst populations are functions of age , metallicity , and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we assume that the imf has a universal nature and does not depend on a particular location in arp  10 .    in order to compare model and observed spectra , the latter should be corrected for internal extinction .",
    "the values of v - band extinction from hii regions estimated in   [ s4.1 ] may differ considerably from the interstellar extinction in other regions of arp  10 .",
    "fortunately , most spectral indices do not depend on extinction , since they are defined in relatively narrow bands of the spectrum .",
    "we use index definitions by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . out of 31 indices ,",
    "27 can be measured in our spectral range .    to find the indices that can effectively serve as indicators of age and metallicity , we use three population synthesis codes : starburst99 ( the latest version is based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxev @xcite , and worthey s code @xcite .",
    "the starburst99 code produces high - resolution synthetic spectra with dispersion 0.3   pixel@xmath0 in our spectral range .",
    "it allows us to smooth the model spectra down to our resolution of 5    and 8  .",
    "the starburst99 code allows to obtain spectra of a single - burst population and to choose parameters for a given imf .",
    "we use the kroupa imf @xcite and padova set of stellar models .",
    "the spectral indices were calculated from the obtained high resolution synthetic spectra .",
    "the galaxev code provides spectral indices for a set of ages , metallicities , spectral resolutions , and stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "we choose the chabrier imf @xcite , which is similar to the kroupa imf , and padova evolutionary tracks .",
    "the third population synthesis code @xcite is considered here only for illustrative purposes because of its incompleteness at ages of the order of 100 myr .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows how the spectral indices obtained with starburst99 ( dashed lines ) , galaxev ( solid lines ) , and worthey s code ( dotted lines ) change with age of a single - burst population .",
    "the metallicity is fixed in all models and equal to 0.008 ( assuming 0.02 for the solar metallicity ) , which is close to a mean value of metallicity of young population derived for arp  10 in   [ s4.1 ] .",
    "we note that the indices derived with the worthey s code do not extend below 400  myr .",
    "starburst99 and galaxev show general agreement , although a systematic offset in the values of indices is seen between the two codes . for our analysis",
    ", we need spectral indices that show a significant monotonous variation with age .",
    "as is seen in figure  [ f6 ] , not all indices change monotonously between 0  myr and 500  myr , which is an expected range of ages of young stars in collisional ring galaxies .",
    "some indices vary negligibly with age .",
    "an additional uncertainty is introduced by a dependence of spectral indices on metallicity . in principle , the hydrogen line indices based on the strength of h@xmath27 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 lines are the best age indicators . unfortunately , a presence of emission lines makes it impossible to utilize them .",
    "another age - sensitive index @xmath42 has to be used with caution , because it is defined on a 500    bandpass in the blue part of spectrum and thus depends on the poorly known value of internal extinction .",
    "for instance , an extinction of @xmath43 1 mag will decrease @xmath42 by 7% @xcite .",
    "three iron - sensitive indices ( fe5406 , fe5709 , and fe5782 ) are not good for the analysis , because their bandpasses interfere with strong night sky lines in our spectra .",
    "finally , we accept 18 spectral indices for the further analysis of arp  10 .",
    "the observed radial distribution of these indices is shown in figure  [ f6.2 ]    a brief inspection of figure  [ f6.2 ] and comparison of figure  [ f6.2 ] with figure  [ f6 ] show that the indices are sensitive to the presence of young stars in the inner and outer rings .",
    "systematically smaller values of fe , mg , ca , ti , and d4000 indices are seen in the both rings . since arp  10 is unlikely to have a similar systematic variation in metallicity , the observed variation of indices should be interpreted as a presence of young stellar population .",
    "in this section we make predictions about metallicities and ring propagation velocities in arp  10 by fitting the radial distribution of model spectral indices to that of the observed ones .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the stellar disk of arp  10 consists of young and old stellar populations .",
    "the old stellar population has an age of either 10  gyr or 5  gyr .",
    "the former value is typical for elliptical galaxies without ongoing star formation and early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "the latter value is typical for blue low surface brightness and for late - type galaxies .",
    "these values are chosen to represent two limiting ages of old stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "the old stellar population in our model consists of an exponential disk and bulge , the radial scale lengths of which ( @xmath44  kpc and @xmath45  kpc , respectively ) were obtained from photometry in   [ s2 ] .",
    "the radial surface density distribution of the old stellar population is described as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is derived in ",
    "[ s7 ] to be 300  @xmath48  pc@xmath49 and the bulge - to - disk ratio of their central surface densities is 17.67 .",
    "the young population emerges after a passage of two circular gas density waves , which propagate from the center of arp  10 toward its periphery and trigger star formation .",
    "we assume constant propagation velocities of the outer and inner waves ( representing the outer and inner rings ) and denote their values by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the radial distribution of metallicity of both young and old stars can be approximated by a linear function of radius . in the following text ,",
    "we normalize metallicities ( derived from the spectral index modeling ) to the solar value ( @xmath52 ) and denote the resulting relative metallicities as @xmath53 . using the oxygen abundance estimates in   [ s4.1 ] and assuming that the fractional abundances in arp  10 are similar to those at the sun , we assume the relative metallicity of young stars in the center of arp  10 to be @xmath54  dex . the metallicity gradient of young stars @xmath55 is negligible and we set its value to zero .",
    "we find the metallicity of old stars @xmath56 in the center of arp  10 and metallicity gradient @xmath57 using the least - square fit of model spectral indices to the observed indices in the inner 0.7  kpc and in the outer region between 16.3  kpc and 18.8  kpc .",
    "this can be done because the region outside the outer ring consists of the old stellar population only .",

    "the radial profile of @xmath163 has a local minimum at 11  kpc , a radius at which the flow of gas is reversed from expansion to contraction toward the inner ring ( see figure  [ f12 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath163 starts to grow again at smaller radii and reaches a maximum near the position of the inner ring . inside the inner ring",
    ", @xmath163 quickly drops to a minimum .",
    "similar double - peak radial profiles of @xmath163 were found along the radial cuts taken at @xmath164 and @xmath165 away from cut  2 .",
    "we note that the rotation curve in figure  [ f5 ] does not have a well - defined double - peaked shape , probably due to azimuthal averaging along circular rings .",
    "we compare the measured radial profile of @xmath163 with that obtained in our numerical modeling .",
    "that is , we take a radial cut through the densest region in the outer ring ( dashed line in figure  [ f12 ] ) and plot the resulting radial profile of @xmath163 along this cut by the solid line in figure  [ f12 ] . although a quantitative agreement is difficult to attain in our simplified thin - disk model due to neglected vertical dynamics of arp  10 , a qualitative agreement is clearly seen and is encouraging .",
    "we consider a characteristic double - peak radial profile of circular velocity to be powerful evidence in favor of the collisional origin of arp  10 .",
    "a good agreement between the modeled and measured sizes and maximum expansion velocities of the rings in arp  10 suggests that approximately 85  myr have passed since the collision .",
    "our simulations indicate that the velocity of the companion has dropped to approximately 480  km  s@xmath0 at @xmath161  myr after the collision , which is also in agreement with the measured velocity of the companion .",
    "the first resonant ring forms soon after the collision so that the age of the outer ring should be equal or less than 85  myr . the spectroscopic analysis in   [ s5 ] suggests a similar age , 90  myr .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath3 emission from the outer ring of arp  10 is characterized by a crescent shape ( figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "we test a conclusion of @xcite that this peculiar h@xmath3 morphology is a result of both the off - center collision and star formation threshold in the gas disk of arp  10 .",
    "we model the h@xmath3 surface brightness in arp  10 using a method described in @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to obey a schmidt law @xcite in the form @xmath166 where the star formation rate @xmath167 and gas surface density @xmath168 are measured in units of @xmath48  yr@xmath0  kpc@xmath49 and @xmath48  pc@xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we modify the schmidt law  ( [ schmidt ] ) by assuming that star formation terminates if the toomre @xmath124-parameter exceeds @xmath169 , a critical value for stability of gas disks ( characterized by a flat rotation curve ) against local non - axisymmetric perturbations @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is converted to the h@xmath3 luminosity using a calibration of @xcite for solar metallicity @xmath170 metal - poor stars produce more ionizing photons than metal - rich stars . the star - forming regions in arp  10 have lower than the solar metallicity and equation  ( [ halpha ] ) is expected to give a lower limit on the h@xmath3 luminosity .",
    "the extinction in the gas disk of arp  10 is taken into account by estimating @xmath171 from the model s known gas surface density via the relation given in @xcite for @xmath172 . the model h@xmath3 fluxes",
    "are then corrected for the internal extinction @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f13 ] shows the gas surface density distribution ( left ) and h@xmath3 surface brightness distribution ( right ) at three consecutive times after the collision @xmath174  myr , 85  myr , and 105  myr .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of h@xmath3 surface brightness in the outer ring has a characteristic crescent shape .",
    "the values of model h@xmath3 surface brightness @xmath175 in the outer ring agree approximately with the values measured by @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the measured variation of @xmath175 is between @xmath176  erg  s@xmath0  cm@xmath49  arcsec@xmath49 for the faintest part of the outer ring and @xmath178  erg  s@xmath0  cm@xmath49  arcsec@xmath49 for its brightest part .",
    "these values are not corrected for the internal extinction .",
    "the model predicts values equal or less than @xmath179  erg  s@xmath0  cm@xmath49  arcsec@xmath49 but corrected for the mean internal extinction in the outer ring @xmath180  mag as described above .    .",
    "[ f13 ]    comparison between h@xmath3 and gas distributions clearly indicates that the h@xmath3 emission originates from regions with the highest gas surface density .",
    "these regions are characterized by @xmath181 , while the rest of the outer ring has @xmath182 .",
    "significant azimuthal variations of the @xmath124-parameter in the outer ring are easiest to reproduce by a slightly off - center collision ( 2.7  kpc ) , while a bull - eye central collision would require for more sophisticated physical conditions in the outer ring ( e.g. systematic variations in gas temperatures along the ring perimeter ) .",
    "thus we confirm that an off - center collision and star formation threshold are most probably responsible for the lack of h@xmath3 emission from the north - eastern part of the arp  10 outer ring , a conclusion previously made by @xcite .",
    "our modeling predicts that the inner ring should be significantly less prominent in h@xmath3 than the outer ring .",
    "this seems to contradict the observations .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to the adopted gas isothermality in our numerical model  high gas densities in the inner ring might have invoked substantial cooling , which had lowered the gas temperature and associated star formation threshold .",
    "it is interesting to consider the model - predicted temporal variations in the h@xmath3 surface brightness shown in figure  [ f13 ] ( right frames ) . in the early phase of evolution ,",
    "arp  10 was less prominent in h@xmath3 , mainly due to a higher gas density and associated extinction in the expanding rings . at the present epoch ,",
    "arp  10 is likely to have reached a peak in the h@xmath3 surface brightness . in the next 20  myr , arp  10",
    "is expected to fade in h@xmath3 , mainly due to a drop in the gas surface density of the outer ring .",
    "the radius of the stellar disk in arp  10 at the @xmath183  mag  arcsec@xmath49 isophote is @xmath184 = 28  kpc , according to rc3 @xcite .",
    "the middle - right panel in figure  [ f13 ] indicates that the present h@xmath3 ring in arp  10 is located at about half the radius of the stellar disk .",
    "this tendency was also found by @xcite for a sample of 15 northern ring galaxies .",
    "thus we argue that a preferable location of h@xmath3 rings at half the stellar disk radius is probably caused by high extinction in the early expansion phase ( which obscures h@xmath3 emission and hinders detection of small rings ) and by a drop in the gas surface density below the star formation threshold in the later expansion phase .",
    "we caution that in the real systems there may be other mechanisms such as an interaction between rings and spiral density waves , which affect local star formation and h@xmath3 fluxes .",
    "we also note that the observed outer ring in arp  10 has a noticeably larger eccentricity than the model outer ring .",
    "this is not a geometry effect because of low inclination of arp  10 ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we attribute a low eccentricity of our model outer ring to several factors .",
    "these are the two - dimensional nature of our modeling , initially axisymmetric distribution of gas in the disk of pre - collision arp  10 , and use of a fixed dark matter halo that can not move in responce to the companion .",
    "the gas - to - stellar mass ratio in arp  10 is about @xmath186 within a 50  kpc radius , which is typical for spiral galaxies .",
    "the global star formation rate ( sfr ) in arp  10 can be estimated either from far - infrared ( fir ) or h@xmath3 fluxes .",
    "the h@xmath3 flux is affected by the internal extinction , which according to   [ s4.1 ] may vary considerably across the disk of arp  10 .",
    "therefore , we use the fir fluxes taken from the ned database to estimate the fir luminosity of arp  10 .",
    "the fir fluxes of 0.784 jy ( 60 @xmath187 m ) and 1.767 jy ( 100 @xmath187 m ) suggest the fir luminosity @xmath188 .",
    "this value corresponds to the sfr of 21  @xmath189  yr@xmath0 , if a conversion factor between the fir luminosity and sfr from @xcite is used in combination with a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "we note that according to @xcite the conversion factor can be almost twice lower than the value derived by @xcite .",
    "hence , we set a lower limit on the sfr in arp  10 to be 10 @xmath189  yr@xmath0 .",
    "this value is still a factor of two larger than that derived by @xcite using the h@xmath3 photometry .",
    "@xcite also found that sfrs estimated from fir fluxes are also larger than those estimated from h@xmath3 fluxes .",
    "we attribute this difference to the internal extinction , which lowers h@xmath3-estimated sfrs .",
    "the sfr in arp  10 is very similar to that inferred by @xcite for the cartwheel .    on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical simulations predict the present sfr in arp  10 to be about @xmath190  yr@xmath0 . if our fir - based value of 10  21 @xmath48  yr@xmath0 is correct , it means that the star formation efficiency in arp  10 is twice to four times more efficient than that derived by @xcite and used by us in equation  ( [ schmidt ] ) .",
    "this elevated efficiency of star formation appears to be a common feature of ring galaxies .",
    "for instance , the cartwheel galaxy is also characterized by a star formation efficiency three times larger than that of isolated and interacting galaxies in the kennicutt s sample @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that the sfr in arp  10 was a nearly linear function of time during the last 85  myr .",
    "hence , the present epoch sfr of 10  21 @xmath189  yr@xmath0 suggests that @xmath191 of young stars were born as a result of the passage of the density wave .",
    "this is less than @xmath192 of the total stellar disk mass .    at the same time ,",
    "arp  10 has converted 3  @xmath193 of the total gas mass into stars .",
    "these values have to be certainly taken as lower limits for the star formation efficiency because only approximately half of the total gas content is located in the inner 16  kpc .",
    "the spectral and numerical modeling of arp  10 performed by us has several limitations and simplified assumptions , the impact of which on our results we discuss below .",
    "an assumption of constant propagation velocity of the rings made in   [ s4 ]",
    "contradicts numerical simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the early evolutionary stage ,",
    "the rings propagate faster than in the late stage .",
    "this tendency can be seen in figure  [ f5.2 ] , which shows the azimuthal profiles of the gas expansion velocity in the outer ring at t=85  myr ( solid line ) and t=105  myr ( dashed line ) after the collision .",
    "the assumption of constant propagation velocity introduces additional uncertainty to the spectral modeling .",
    "a faint signal and low - quality of long - slit spectra in the inter - ring region and behind the outer ring introduces an uncertainty in the spectral index modeling . because of the adopted thin - disk approximation , we can not model the vertical motions in the disk of arp  10 after the collision , although these motions are well seen in the velocity fields in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "ideally , a three - dimensional hydrodynamic model of arp  10 should be combined with a population synthesis model , and the resulting model colors and spectra should be compared with observational data .",
    "high - resolution maps of gas density and internal extinction of arp  10 would be needed in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the observed kinematics , spectral index modeling , and hydrodynamic modeling of arp  10 are in general agreement .",
    "this suggests that we envision correctly a general picture of the collision and subsequent star formation in arp  10 .",
    "we postpone a more detailed numerical and spectral modeling to a future paper .",
    "we apply kinematic , spectral , and numerical approaches to develop a self - consistent model of propagating star formation in a collisional ring galaxy arp  10 .",
    "our kinematic data have the best spatial resolution obtained for arp  10 to date .",
    "we found that the pre - collision arp  10 was a large ( sb ? ) disk galaxy with an extended low surface density exponential stellar disk ( scale length 7.2 kpc ) , substantial exponential bulge , and massive dark matter halo .",
    "the spiral arms that are traceable in our b - band and h@xmath3 images beyond the outer ring suggest that arp  10 has had a spiral structure before the collision .",
    "our spectral index modeling suggests the solar ( using all selected indices or mg , ca , and ti - related indices ) or slightly subsolar ( using iron - dominated spectral indices ) metallicity of the old stellar population in the center of arp  10 .",
    "the gradient of relative metallicity of the old population is @xmath194  dex  kpc@xmath0 .",
    "the available measurements of the total hydrogen mass and the shape of the rotation curve suggest high values of the toomre @xmath124-parameter ( @xmath195 ) in the pre - collision gas disk of arp  10 , which implies that star formation was moderated or even totally suppressed before the collision",
    ". the @xmath124-parameter may decrease below a tentative stability limit of 1.6 if either a substantial undetected amount of molecular gas is present or the gas disk is highly concentrated to the center .",
    "both possibilities appear to be unlikely . from the spectra of arp  10 we estimate the oxygen abundance to be 12+log(o / h)=8.6 with little variation along the radius .",
    "some 85 myr ago an early - type spiral galaxy ( sab ? ) passed slightly off - center and near - axially through the disk of arp  10 .",
    "the velocity of the intruder galaxy was about 800  km  s@xmath0 at the time of closest encounter and its mass was about @xmath196 the mass of the target galaxy .",
    "the intruder is now seen as a small `` knot '' 5 arcsec to the south - west from the nucleus of arp  10 .",
    "the gravitational perturbation from the intruder generated two outwardly expanding density waves , which are presently seen in the b - band and h@xmath3 images as bright asymmetric rings .",
    "the expansion velocity of gas in the outer ring is a strong function of azimuth , with a maximum value of about @xmath162  km  s@xmath0 in the brightest part of the ring and a minimum value of about @xmath197  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the inner ring has a more symmetric shape than the outer ring and expands with a velocity less than 50  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the propagating density waves in arp  10 do not generate strong shock waves .",
    "star formation is triggered at the crest of an expanding gas density wave , if the gas surface density exceeds a star formation threshold .",
    "an apparent crescent - like distribution of h@xmath3 emission in the outer ring is most probably caused by a variation of the toomre @xmath124-parameter along the ring .",
    "the current star formation rate is estimated from the far - infrared flux to be 10 ",
    "21 @xmath189  yr@xmath0",
    ". the expanding waves of star formation have created less than @xmath192 of the total stellar disk mass since the collision .",
