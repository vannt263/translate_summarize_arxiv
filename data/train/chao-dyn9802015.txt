    "<S> we consider a parametrically forced pendulum with a vertically oscillating suspension point . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that , as the amplitude of the vertical oscillation is increased , its inverted state ( corresponding to the vertically - up configuration ) undergoes a cascade of `` resurrections , '' i.e. , it becomes stabilized after its instability , destabilize again , and so forth _ ad infinitum_. we make a detailed numerical investigation of the bifurcations associated with such resurrections of the inverted pendulum by varying the amplitude and frequency of the vertical oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the inverted state stabilizes via alternating `` reverse '' subcritical pitchfork and period - doubling bifurcations , while it destabilizes via alternating `` normal '' supercritical period - doubling and pitchfork bifrucations . </S>",
    "<S> an infinite sequence of period - doubling bifurcations , leading to chaos , follows each destabilization of the inverted state . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviors in the period - doubling cascades are also discussed . </S>"
