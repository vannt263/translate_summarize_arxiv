    "among the discoveries made by the _ swift _ satellite within a few months of its launch is the observation that a fraction of long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) go through an early phase of relatively slow decline in the x - ray afterglow flux that typically starts at a few minutes after the burst and lasts for about an hour @xcite .",
    "this phase is followed by a somewhat faster and more typical flux decay that satisfies the expected relation between the temporal decline index @xmath6 and the spectral index @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , similar to what was observed before the _ swift _ era when the monitoring of the afterglow light curves started at least several hours after the grb .",
    "the spectral index does not seem to undergo any change when the light - curve transitions ( at @xmath9s ) from a shallow decline ( @xmath10 ) to the `` regular '' decline ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "it has been argued convincingly by a number of authors that the more slowly declining lightcurve , like the `` regular '' flux decay rate that follows it , are both produced by the shock heated circum - burst medium @xcite .",
    "the shallow x - ray flux decay is widely attributed to energy injection into the afterglow shock , which may be caused by either a long lived activity of the central source , or a short lived central explosion that produces ejecta with some distribution of lorentz factor ( lf ) , cf .",
    "@xcite . in either of these scenarios",
    "the deceleration of the afterglow shock is reduced due to the energy being added to it , and this in turn produces a slowly declining light curve .",
    "slow decline of the early optical lightcurve was also reported before the _ swift _ era , although quite rarely , e.g. grb  021004 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have made a good case that the slowly declining early optical lightcurve of grb  021004 could naturally occur for a stellar wind type external medium when the optical band is below the characteristic synchrotron frequency ( and above the cooling break frequency ) .",
    "however , this explanation is unlikely to work for the slowly declining x - ray lightcurves since the x - ray band at @xmath12hr after a grb is expected to lie well above the synchrotron characteristic frequency , and furthermore there is no evidence for a change in the spectral slope across the break in the x - ray lightcurve at @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite argued that the early flat optical lightcurve of grb  021004 is either due to energy injection into the afterglow shock , or due to angular inhomogeneity (  patchy shell  ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter was favored as it also provided a good explanation for the fluctuations ( or `` bumps '' ) that appear later in the optical lightcurve of grb  021004 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the sparse early afterglow data in the pre-_swift _ era made it difficult to distinguish between the different explanations .",
    "a long lived activity of the central source is not very appealing since it would require the source to be active up to several hours after the grb , with a very smooth temporal behavior , where most of the energy is in the outflow that is ejected around @xmath14s ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this makes the problem of the observed high efficiency for converting kinetic energy to gamma - ray radiation much worse @xcite .",
    "another interesting way to produce an early flat phase in the afterglow light curve @xcite is by a line of sight that is slightly outside the ( sharp ) edge of a roughly uniform jet @xcite .",
    "this would , however , naturally be accompanied by a weaker and softer prompt emission , perhaps resulting in an x - ray flash or x - ray rich grb rather than a classical grb ; the more pronounced this effect is the flatter and longer lived the slow x - ray afterglow decay phase should be .",
    "initial inspection of the data does not show such a correlation , suggesting that viewing angle effects are probably not the predominant cause of the early slow decay phase in the x - ray afterglows , at least under the simplest assumptions .    it is natural to expect that matter ejected in any explosion",
    "will have a range of velocities or lfs .",
    "after a while ( on a time scale , in the observer frame , of order a few times the duration of the central engine activity ) the ejecta will rearrange themselves such that the fastest moving plasma is at the head of the outflow and the slowest at the tail end .",
    "this can occur either through internal shocks within the outflow , or by a smooth decrease in the lf of the outflow toward the end of the central source activity .",
    "if the ejecta have a finite range of lfs , the slower ejecta would gradually catch up with the shocked external medium , injecting energy into the forward shock .",
    "if the slower ejecta carry more energy than the faster ejecta , then this added energy would gradually increase the energy of the afterglow shock , causing it to decelerate more gradually .",
    "once the energy in the lower lf ejecta becomes small compared to the energy already in the afterglow shock , the blast wave evolution becomes impulsive ( i.e. the subsequent small amount of energy injection hardly effects the evolution of the forward shock ) , and if radiative losses are unimportant then it approaches the adiabatic @xcite self - similar solution .",
    "this occurs when the lf of the afterglow shock drops slightly below @xmath15 , the lf where @xmath16 peaks and where most of the energy in the outflow resides .    in this paper",
    "we use the _ swift _ data to determine the time dependence of the blast wave lf .",
    "we find that the lf typically drops by a factor of @xmath4 during the shallow decline phase .",
    "this is consistent with the basic picture suggested above , where a finite lf distribution for the ejecta causes a more gradual decline of the forward - shock lf , which gives rise to a shallow light - curve , and is an intermediate transition stage before the onset of the adiabatic blandford - mckee solution .",
    "the emission from an external shock can be described in terms of the shock front lf ( @xmath17 ) and the density profile of the circum - stellar medium ( csm ) . for a uniform csm the synchrotron characteristic frequency ( @xmath18 ) , the cooling frequency ( @xmath19 ) and the flux at the peak of the spectrum ( @xmath20 ) , in the observer frame , are proportional to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , where @xmath24 is the observed time .",
    "the flux at a frequency between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath25 and for the observed band above @xmath18 and @xmath19 the flux scales as @xmath26 .",
    "the observed flux is strongly dependent on @xmath17 and therefore even a small deviation from the @xmath27 scaling has a very large effect on the observed light - curve .",
    "the observed flux has a weaker dependence on @xmath17 for a wind like density stratification of the csm ; the flux in the two regimes considered above scales roughly as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "more generally , for a power law external density profile , @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35    assuming that the lf distribution for the ejecta is @xmath36 , we find @xmath37 is smaller by an amount @xmath38 compared to the standard value of @xmath39 , i.e. 3/8 ( 1/4 ) for a uniform ( wind ) csm , where @xmath40 } = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix }   3a/[8(8+a ) ] & \\ \\",

    "\\end{matrix}\\right.\\ ] ]    we next calculate @xmath38 for a number of swift detected grbs with a shallow lc using the observed spectral index and the change in the temporal power - law index for the x - ray lightcurve ( @xmath41 ) between the shallow and the `` regular '' parts of the lc .",
    "the results for @xmath38 , and the change to the lf during the shallow lc are shown in table 1 .",
    "we note that the change to @xmath17 during the shallow phase of the lc was calculated using the appropriate dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath24 ; for a uniform csm this is @xmath46 .",
    "it can be seen in table 1 that @xmath17 changes by a factor @xmath4 for all the bursts , with a uniform csm , during the shallow lc phase ; these numbers change only by a small amount even if we take the forward shock emission , and the shallow decline , to begin at the end of the grb .",
    "the function @xmath16 peaks at @xmath47 , the lf of the forward shock at the end of the shallow decline phase of the x - ray lightcurve . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the power - law index @xmath50 is given in table 1 for a number of bursts detected by swift and lies between @xmath51 and @xmath52 if the csm has uniform density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* report similar values ",
    "@xmath53 in their notation ) ;",
    "@xmath54 if the medium in the vicinity of grb is taken to be a wind - csm which means that @xmath16 must have a very narrow peak of width @xmath55 which is unlikely to be realized in nature . ] or alternatively the central source has to be active for several hours with little variability and a roughly constant rate of energy output in relativistic outflow  neither of these possibilities seem very plausible and so the case of a wind - csm is not considered any further in this paper . for @xmath56 the function @xmath57 should decrease with decreasing @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) as otherwise slower moving ejecta will continue to add substantial amount of energy to the forward shock thereby retarding its deceleration and slowing down the decline of the lightcurve . since the spectral index and the lightcurve power - law decay index after the end of the shallow decline phase obey the relationship expected for an adiabatic forward shock evolution we conclude that indeed @xmath58 , but its exact value is otherwise unconstrained .",
    "radio calorimetry for a number of grbs has concluded that there is not a whole lot of energy in grbs in the form of mildly relativistic ejecta with @xmath59 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this further strengthens our conclusion that @xmath58 , and that this scaling might extends to @xmath59 .",
    "we note that for a given total energy in the explosion of order @xmath60erg the relation @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , must turnover at some @xmath17 of order @xmath63 or so otherwise the energy in the relativistic ejecta will exceed the total available energy ( energy in relativistic ejecta with @xmath64 is of order @xmath65erg ) .",
    "we have now considerable body of evidence that long duration grbs are accompanied by a supernova of type ic , which expels a few solar masses of material at velocities of order @xmath66 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , must again turnover over and have a peak at @xmath69 . putting all these together we show a schematic behavior of @xmath70 ( i.e. @xmath67 ) in figure 1 .",
    "we have pieced together the distribution of energy in gamma - ray burst ejecta as a function of the four - velocity @xmath68 for @xmath71 . the distribution function , @xmath67 , has two peaks : one at @xmath72 and another at @xmath73 . for @xmath74",
    ", it falls off as @xmath75 with @xmath76 , as is determined from the shallow decline of the x - ray lightcurve at early times ( @xmath77s ) observed for a good fraction of bursts detected by the swift satellite .",
    "the distribution at low @xmath78 is obtained by observations of supernovae ic that are associated with grbs . in the intermediate regime of @xmath79 the shape of the distribution function @xmath67 is very uncertain , but we argue that it is likely to be at least flat or slowly rising in this range .",
    "a prediction of this model for the shallow decline of x - ray light - curve , that is based on a deviation ( at early times ) from the constant energy blandford - mckee self - similar solution , is that we should see a roughly similar shallow decline in the optical band over the same time interval as in the x - ray data . since the optical and the x - ray bands in general lie in different segments of the synchrotron spectrum , and",
    "because the energy added to the forward shock by slower moving ejecta should be accompanied by a mildly relativistic reverse shock that could provide some added flux to the optical lightcurve , the rate of decline for the x - ray and optical lightcurves should be similar but not identical in this model . and",
    "@xmath44 the temporal decay index @xmath6 of the reverse shock emission is slightly smaller ( corresponding to a slightly shallower flux decay ) than that for the forward shock within the corresponding pls , by @xmath80 . for the plss @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "the reverse shock emission decays somewhat faster than that of the forward shock at the corresponding pls , by @xmath83 . ]",
    "a highly magnetized outflow could significantly weaken the reverse shock ( or even eliminate it altogether ) and thus suppress its emission .",
    "the alternative explanation of a viewing angle slightly outside the edge of the jet would lead to a gradual steepening of the afterglow lightcurve ( i.e. a gradual increase in @xmath6 , as the beaming cone of the afterglow emission gradually approaches and eventually encompasses the line of sight ) , while a steeper break in the light curve is possible ( and arguably , might also be expected ) in the model described in this work , when the stage of energy injection into the afterglow shock ends .",
    "the challenge posed for grb / sne models is to understand what physical processes give rise to @xmath84 and why the lf distribution of the ejecta peaks at a value roughly @xmath85 .",
    "understanding these results should help illuminate the processes operating during the period in which the central engine of gamma - ray burst is active and the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the collapsing star and its immediate surroundings .",
