    "an impressive progress in understanding of specific biological regulatory mechanisms which play an important role in the way numerous molecular components interact have been made recently .",
    "this would be a key to control the development and physiology of a whole living organism .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of large gene expression regulatory networks is still far from being understood mainly because of two reasons : first , up to now , a little is known of the global structure of genetic networks .",
    "there is still no a common opinion on whether they are organized hierarchically ( say , as a highly inhomogeneous scalable metabolic network as reported in @xcite ) or contains a plenty of cross interactions , might be of quite irregular structure , organized in a form of connected sets of small sub - networks .",
    "second , the relations between the global structure of networks and their local dynamical properties are also still unclear .",
    "a useful approach to the regulatory networks comprising of just a few elements consists of modelling their interactions by boolean equations . in this context , _ feedback circuits _",
    "( the circular sequences of interactions ) have been shown to play the key dynamical roles : whereas positive circuits are able to generate multistationarity , negative circuits may generate oscillatory behavior @xcite .",
    "genetic networks are represented by the fully connected boolean networks where each element interacts with all elements including itself .",
    "a feedback circuit can be formally defined as a combination of terms of the jacobian matrix of the system , with indices forming a circular permutation .",
    "flexibility in network design is introduced by the use of boolean parameters , one associated with each interaction of group of interactions affecting a given element . within this formalism",
    ", a feedback circuit will generate its typical dynamical behavior ( either stationary or oscillating ) only for appropriate values of some of its logical parameters , @xcite .    most often in biology",
    ", the interactions between various molecular components can have a definite sign .",
    "for any circuit , one can easily check that each element exerts an indirect effect on itself which has the same sign for all elements of the circuit , leading to the definition of the `` circuit sign '' .",
    "in fact , this sign only depends on the parity of the number of negative interactions involved in the circuit : if this number is even , then the circuit is positive ; if this number is odd , then the circuit is negative , @xcite .",
    "what makes these concepts important is that specific biological and dynamical properties can be associated with each of theses two classes of feedback circuits .",
    "the relation between the presence of positive feedback loops and the occurrence of multiple states of gene expression has been at a focus of investigations for several years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , it has been proven that the presence of positive loop(s ) is a necessary condition for multistationarity , and the negative circuits ( with two or more elements ) are required for the stable periodicity of behavior , @xcite .",
    "biologically , this means that positive circuits are required for differentiative decisions and negative circuits are for the homeostasis , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the large regulatory networks comprising of many hundreds or even thousands of elements , the detailed logical analysis of possible feedback circuits seems to be impossible now , since the effect that the element can put on itself indirectly , in large regulatory networks , may follow along many different pathways ( indeed , if the interaction network is enough dense ) engaging probably a plenty of distinct feedback structures at once . furthermore",
    ", numerical observations over the various large discrete time regulatory networks convinced us that the `` functionable '' circuits and the rest `` passive '' elements are tightly related to each other in a way that they play the role of `` stabilizers '' for the active circuits : a dislocation made to an element of the inactive circuit may stampede a change to some `` functionable '' circuits and even cause they dissolve .    in the present paper , we focus our attention on the large gene expression regulatory networks defined on some `` maximal '' graph @xmath12 . to get a qualitative understanding of their dynamical behavior , we consider a statistical ensemble of such regulatory networks , in which the thresholds assigned to each pairwise gene interaction and its sign are considered as the discrete random variables taking their values in accordance to some statistical laws .",
    "let us note that at present the values of regulatory parameters driving the behavior of actual gene expression regulatory networks are mostly unknown , so that it would be interesting to test the _ sensitivity _ of local dynamics observed in large regulatory networks to the random change of switching parameters , for the different types of such networks .",
    "starting from the fixed initial conditions , in large gene expression regulatory networks , we shuffled these switching parameters randomly and , otherwise , randomized the initial conditions for a fixed layout of thresholds and interaction signs .",
    "the long time dynamical behavior observed in such a statistical ensemble of large regulatory networks depends essentially upon the topology of underlying `` maximal '' graph including all possible pairwise interactions in between genes of the given set .",
    "short transient processes arisen in such systems at the onset of simulations conclude into the statistically stable behavior , that is , either a stationary configuration or the multi - periodic oscillations occupying up to a half of system size , in the homogeneous regulatory networks having a plenty of negative interactions .",
    "in contrast to the spreading of chaotic state over the regular and random arrays of piecewise linear and logistic discrete time coupled maps studied extensively in the last decade @xcite-@xcite , oscillations arisen in the discrete time regulatory networks do not propagate over the whole system and are bounded merely to the oscillating domains .",
    "lack of negative interactions and directed cycles in the networks brings it into one of fixed points which position in the phase space of system depends upon the certain choice of initial conditions and the layouts of switching parameters .",
    "the structure of active subgraph of @xmath13 in the homogeneous regulatory networks settled at a fixed point , resembles that one of erds - rnyi s random graphs , @xcite .",
    "the plan of paper is following , in sec.2 , we define the models of large synchronized regulatory networks defined on the both homogeneous and inhomogeneous `` maximal '' graphs where the switching parameters are shuffled randomly . in sec.3 , we present the results of numerical simulations on large regulatory networks . in sec .  4",
    ", we introduce the mean field approach to the stochastic ensembles of large discrete time regulatory gene expression networks with randomly shuffled thresholds of type interactions between genes and their interaction signs .",
    "then we conclude in the last section .",
    "we define the regulatory gene expression network @xmath14 on the directed graph @xmath12 with the set of nodes @xmath15 connected by the edges @xmath16 representing the action of gene @xmath17 onto gene @xmath18 ( the self - action of genes is possible and corresponds to the loops in @xmath13 ) .",
    "we call @xmath12 as a _ maximal _",
    "graph since it contains _ all _ possible interactions in between genes of the given set .",
    "the regulatory principle of gene expression networks is that the protein synthesis rate of a gene is affected ( either _ stimulated _ or _ inhibited _ ) by the proteins synthesized by other genes provided their instantaneous concentrations are below ( or over ) some threshold values .",
    "we assign the positive sign @xmath19 to an interaction if @xmath17 stimulates the synthesis of protein in @xmath18 , and the negative sign @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "indeed , in the real genome , the rate of protein synthesis varies from pair to pair of interacting genes , however , for a simplicity , in the present paper , we suppose that all interactions between genes are of equal _ effectiveness _ , so that all edges presented in @xmath13 have the equal weight .",
    "the maximal graph @xmath13 is specified by its _",
    "matrix @xmath21 such that @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 otherwise .",

    "the parameter @xmath60 is a positive constant expressing the decay rate of protein concentrations , the second term in ( [ x ] ) describes the rates of protein synthesis .",
    "the protein decay rate @xmath61 determines a time scale in the system , @xmath62 and does not affect its stable asymptotic behavior .",
    "for the first time , such a model has been discussed in @xcite where the dynamics of several low dimensional examples of genetic expression networks have been considered .",
    "it is important to note that the precise values of switching parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are at present unknown for the most of pairwise interactions of genes in the genomes of living organisms .",
    "being interested in a qualitative behavior exhibiting by the large gene expression regulatory networks , we consider these switching parameters as the discrete random variables , i.e. we suppose that _ any _ layout of them is possible with some nonzero probability , and study the statistical behavior of the flow @xmath56 over the ensemble of such networks .",
    "namely , we suppose that the threshold assigned to a pairwise interaction of genes can take one of @xmath65 possible values , @xmath66 distributed over the unit interval .",

    "dynamical behavior exhibited by the model with the random layouts of switching parameters depends very much on the topology of maximal graph .",
    "many _ real - world _ networks and gene expression regulatory networks , in particular , can be represented by the inhomogeneous graphs of very complex , may be irregular structure having a large number of nodes .",
    "they can be considered as the _ quasi_-random graphs characterized by some `` statistical '' properties ( for instance , by the probability distributions of degrees of their nodes ) @xcite .",
    "it is understood @xcite that the formation of feedback circuits driving the dynamical behavior in the regulatory networks is closely related to the occurrence of cycles in the underlying `` maximal '' graphs .",
    "in particular , it restricts the application of some random processes ( algorithms ) used for the generation of scale free graphs appropriate for such simulations .",
    "for instance , it is obvious that the popular preferential attachment algorithm proposed in @xcite , in which vertices are added to the graph one at a time and connected to a fixed number of earlier vertices , selected with probabilities proportional to their degrees , is not suitable for the generation of such a `` maximal '' graph , for the gene expression regulatory networks , since it creates a tree like structure with no cycles . in the present paper ,",
    "we use another graph generating algorithm ( details are given in the appendix ) , proposed in @xcite and then used in @xcite for the study of epidemic spreading over the scale free networks .",

    "the most of protein concentrations in the model ( [ x ] ) with the exertion ( [ exx ] ) defined on the directed scale free graphs are driven by their own decays and got fixed fast close to @xmath86 . in particulary , one can not observe oscillations ( as a limiting stable behavior ) in the regulatory gene expression networks ( [ th]-[exx ] ) defined on such graphs with @xmath87 , for any layout of switching parameters and for any assignment of interaction signs .",
    "the occurrence of _ bidirectional _ edges ( when both genes can act onto each other simultaneously ) in the highly inhomogeneous scalable graphs can change dramatically the dynamical behavior of large regulatory networks defined on them . to quantify the value of bidirectional edges in the given `` maximal '' graph",

    "it is important to note the high _ error tolerance _ of scalable regulatory network : in its phase space , the intervals exist which stay void ( @xmath172 even though some nodes had initially been settled into these intervals ) and for which @xmath122 is got fixed independently upon the layout of switching parameters and initial conditions .    when the negative interactions present in abundance ( @xmath143 ) , the valuable fraction of nodes , in the scalable regulatory network , synchronizes either in the first ( next to @xmath173 ) or in the last ( next to @xmath174 ) intervals of phase space .",
    "the nodes demonstrating oscillations of protein concentrations ( about @xmath175 total as @xmath176 ) are scattered in the middle range of phase space .",

    "generally speaking , the problem ( [ x2 ] ) is as complicated as the original one .",
    "however , in some cases it can be more `` illustrative '' revealing the entire dynamical mechanisms of the system . in the simplest case of uniform probabilities",

    "the next step can be done if one supposes some symmetry properties for the sets of @xmath195 that dramatically reduces the number of independent local `` mean '' thresholds @xmath211 to just a few .",
    "in such a case , the entire system can be considered as a set of several coupled positive and negative feedback loops whose dynamical behavior can be a subject of detailed analysis . in particular , in the system with several coupled negative feedback circuits characterized by the distinct thresholds @xmath211 , the synchronous oscillations may persist for @xmath212",
    "in the present paper , we have studied the behavior of large discrete time regulatory networks defined on the homogeneous and scalable maximal graphs .",
    "the `` traditional '' approach to the complex regulatory networks comprising of a few elements reduces their modelling to the boolean equations . in this context",
    ", the concept of `` feedback circuits '' has been discussed extensively . however , for the large regulatory networks , a direct logical analysis seems now impossible because of their complexity .    to get a qualitative insight into the behavior of regulatory networks of thousands elements",
    ", we study how sensitive it is upon the shuffling of switching parameters , that are , the interaction signs @xmath48 and the interaction threshold values @xmath63 . starting from a fixed initial conditions ,",
    "we have shuffled these switching parameters randomly and then randomized the initial conditions for a given layout of thresholds and interaction signs in the network .",
    "the dynamical behavior observed in such a system crucially depends upon the topology of maximal graph including all possible interactions of genes in the given network .    we have found that , in the homogeneous regulatory networks , the parameter @xmath0 balancing the positive and negative interactions allowed between genes is a convenient parameter featuring their dynamical behavior .",
    "when the positive interaction between genes prevail in the system , its dynamical behavior is dominated by the positive feedback circuits responsible for a number of asymptotically stable states , at the same time the influence of negative feedback circuits onto the dynamical behavior of system is negligible . the structure of active subgraph in the regulatory network settled at a fixed point is close to the random graph of erds and rnyi , @xcite . with the increase of percentage of negative interactions up to approximately @xmath135 , the system exhibits a complicated spatiotemporal behavior where the domains of genes with the stationary concentrations of proteins coexist and interleave with those of periodically oscillating concentrations .",
    "the feedback circuits formation , in the regulatory networks defined on the scale free graphs , relays primarily upon the bidirectional edges connecting pairs of mutually interacting genes . for the enough fractions of bidirectional edges , in the scalable regulatory networks",
    ", oscillations can persist even if there is just a few negative interactions allowed between genes of the network .",
    "the model of gene expression regulatory networks which we have considered reveals the similar effect of global scale free topology on the local dynamics of nodes that has been reported recently in @xcite-@xcite on the fractions of infected agents in the undirected scalable networks vs. the effective spreading rates @xmath213 . in the homogeneous networks ,",
    "a dynamical state occupies a valuable fraction of network nodes as a control parameter determining the formation rate of the state exceeds some critical value .",
    "in contrast , in the scalable networks , the dynamical state spreads and persists at whatever value of control parameter .    in the phase space of scalable regulatory networks ,",
    "the intervals exist which stay void ( the occupancy numbers @xmath214 ) and for which @xmath122 is got fixed independently upon the layout of switching parameters and initial conditions . as usual ,",
    "the scale free networks demonstrate their high error tolerance .",
    "the important unsolved problem deserving a thorough investigation is that of dynamics of oscillating domains in the graph . due to the presence of translational invariance ( in average ) in the homogeneous large regulatory gene expression networks , the oscillating domains can probably move in the graph by the interchange of nodes with the stationary part of the network .",
    "we can also suggest that perhaps , in the inhomogeneous large regulatory gene expression networks defined on the scale free graphs , the motion of oscillating domains proceeds not in the `` real space '' of the graph , but rather in between different classes of nodes having the same connectivities .",
    "for instance , we have beheld that while propagating throughout a scale free graph , the dynamical state occupies at first the nodes with minimal connectivities , then those of maximal connectivities ( hubs ) and eventually the nodes of intermediate connectivities .",

    "it has been shown that for many different living organisms the probability degree distributions for both incoming and outgoing edges of a node in the interaction graphs follow the power law , @xmath215 , where @xmath108 is the connectivity of a node .",

    "we briefly explain this algorithm for convenience of the readers .",
