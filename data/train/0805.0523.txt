    "in the last few years quantum entanglement is one of the most active research fields in quantum physics , for a review see refs .  @xcite . on microscopic level of coherent quantum systems entanglement",
    "can be used in various quantum protocols to perform non - classical operations . on the other hand , in the world of macroscopic objects with many degrees of freedom at high temperatures",
    "there is apparently no observable manifestation of entanglement .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain this classicality of macroscopic systems .",
    "most notably , decoherence due to external degrees of freedom is usually credited as being responsible for the disappearance of entanglement from macroscopic superpositions . in a nutshell",
    ", the argument goes as follows : even if the system is in an entangled state at the beginning , , in a coherent superposition of two macroscopic states , time evolution will in general transform this coherent superposition into an incoherent ( , classical ) mixture .",
    "the reason for such decoherence is an always present residual coupling of our central system to many uncontrollable external degrees of freedom  the environment . for a review of decoherence see ref .",
    "however , one must be aware that the evolution of the central system plus environment is still unitary and therefore , even though the final state of the central system and environment will presumably be very complex , in principle , it will be a pure state possessing some bipartite entanglement .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is similar to the one with the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "increasing of the thermodynamic entropy with time is seemingly in contradiction with the reversibility of the underlying equations of motion . for explanation one can use two observations : ( i ) practicality  performing time reversal by ,",
    ", reversing velocities of all particles might be close to impossible from a practical point of view ; ( ii ) probability  initial conditions are prevalently of such form that in almost all cases the entropy will subsequently increase .",
    "similar arguments can be used to explain the apparent lack of entanglement in quantum systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "first , even though joint pure state representing central system and environment is bipartite entangled , the detection of entanglement might be close to impossible because it would require very complex measurements involving very many degrees of freedom . indeed , using entanglement witnesses it has been shown that the detection of entanglement in a sufficiently complex state gets exponentially hard with increasing number of particles  @xcite . for all practical purposes",
    "the detection of entanglement in such states is impossible .",
    "second argument , that is the role played by initial conditions in the course of loosing entanglement by time evolution is the subject of present work .",
    "we are going to study how the entanglement between two qubits changes during hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "hamiltonian evolution will act on a system of totally @xmath0 qubits , two of which will be chosen as our central system of interest while the remaining @xmath1 will act as the `` environment '' . the idea is to study how a general hamiltonian evolution changes entanglement of a smaller subsystem , whose degrees of freedom we presumably are able to control and therefore also measure its entanglement .",
    "time evolution with a general hamiltonian , say quantum chaotic one , will in general produce states whose statistical properties are well described by those of random quantum states . for random quantum state on @xmath0 qubits",
    "one knows  @xcite that tracing out @xmath1 qubits will , for large @xmath0 , with high probability result in a separable two qubit reduced density matrix .",
    "therefore , sufficiently `` complex '' time evolution will eventually wipe out entanglement between two qubits .",
    "how are things then , for instance , in integrable systems , which in general do not generate completely random states ?",
    "one point we have not touched so far is the role played by initial conditions .",
    "for integrable systems there can exist simple initial states for which entanglement will persist also for long times , nevertheless , as we will see , the majority of initial conditions is such that entanglement between two qubits will rapidly decay with time _ irrespective of the hamiltonian_. this universality will be a consequence of the generic form of initial states  their randomness .    the initial pure state will be chosen to be a product state on the central system ( two qubits ) and either random or random product state on the rest .",
    "therefore , initially there will be no entanglement between the two chosen qubits .",
    "we are then going to study how much entanglement can be produced by various hamiltonian evolutions and how long will it take until it disappears .",
    "entanglement will change with time due to two competing effects .",
    "one is entanglement production due to time evolution with non - separable hamiltonian , while the other is entanglement loss due to the spreading of initial state randomness throughout the system and the approach of system s state to a random state . the net result will be the increase of entanglement at short times and a complete lack thereof after some critical time .",
    "in addition , time dependence of entanglement will turn out to be universal , that is independent of the specifics of the hamiltonian used in time evolution .",
    "there have been many studies of entanglement evolutions , let us here mention only those that are closer to the present work and deal with two qubit entanglement .",
    "evolution of concurrence for initial product states has been studied for xy model in magnetic field in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .  @xcite . for sufficiently strong coupling between qubits concurrence initially increased with time after which it rapidly decreased to zero , similarly as in the present work .",
    "evolution of entanglement for initially entangled states of two qubits ( bell states ) which are weakly coupled to a generic environment has been studied in  @xcite . in such cases entanglement",
    "monotonically decreases with time from its maximal value at time zero .",
    "evolution of entanglement for initial bell state in an integrable xy model has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "our hamiltonian will be homogeneous in space and therefore the two qubits of the central system will be coupled .",
    "this must be contrasted to studies of the so - called environment induced entanglement generation  @xcite , where two qubits are uncoupled .",
    "disappearance of entanglement ( on average ) after finite critical time found in the present work is reminiscent of the so - called sudden death of entanglement , where initially entangled state of two uncoupled qubits becomes separable after a finite time of open system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a system consisting of two spins coupled to electrons has been studied for initial separable states in ref .",
    "@xcite , while time evolution of entanglement for initial thermal states in a xy model has been considered in refs .  @xcite . for concurrence in a kicked ising model",
    "see  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "it has been found that starting from an initial non - disordered product state in a spin glass model entanglement can persist for long times .",
    "von neumann entropy of a block of spins in ising model and for product initial state has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "we are going to study entanglement between two qubits which are in turn part of a larger @xmath0 qubit system . for two qubits positivity of partially transposed density matrix with respect to one qubit , @xmath2 ,",
    "is a necessary and sufficient condition for its separability  @xcite .",
    "negative eigenvalues ( for two qubit states there can be at most one ) therefore signal the presence of entanglement",

    "it is simply @xmath6 if the minimal eigenvalue @xmath7 is negative and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "entanglement of formation  @xcite , which quantifies quantum resources needed to create a given state , has nicer mathematical properties as negativity ( or logarithmic negativity ) . for two qubit systems entanglement of formation @xmath9 can be calculated in terms of a simpler quantity called concurrence @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are square roots of decreasingly ordered eigenvalues of @xmath13 , calculated in standard computation basis .",
    "@xmath9 is then given by@xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a binary entropy .",
    "for pure states the entanglement of formation is given by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , while it is defined by a convex roof extension ( minimization over all convex realizations of @xmath16 ) for mixed states .",
    "a state is separable iff its concurrence or iff its negativity is zero .",
    "the third and last quantity used in measuring entanglement will be the so - called fully entangled fraction  @xcite defined as @xmath17 where maximization runs over all maximally entangled states obtained by local unitary transformations from maximally entangled state , , @xmath18 .",
    "one can distill maximally entangled singlets from an ensemble of @xmath16 using bbpssw  @xcite protocol iff @xmath19 .",
    "fully entangled fraction @xmath20 can be used as a lower bound for the entanglement of formation  @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is expressed in terms of binary entropy @xmath23 , @xmath24 in the above inequality an equal sign holds if @xmath16 is pure state .",
    "note that @xmath25 does not necessarily mean that the entanglement of formation is zero .",
    "fully entangled fraction also determines maximal teleportation fidelity  @xcite .",
    "fully entangled fraction @xmath26 is equal to the largest eigenvalue of the real part of the density matrix @xmath16 written in the bell basis , in which all maximally entangled states have real expansion coefficients . if @xmath27 this is in turn equal to  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a real @xmath30 dimensional correlation matrix given by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being pauli matrices , , @xmath33 .",
    "because of its simple analytical form we are going to study @xmath34 ( [ eq : taudef ] ) rather than @xmath26 ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "they essentially give the same information in the interesting regime of @xmath19 . if @xmath35 then the state @xmath16 can be used in entanglement distillation .",
    "norm of the correlation matrix @xmath29 can be used as a simple entanglement criterion also for many - qubit systems  @xcite .    in the following we are therefore going to study negativity @xmath3 ( sometimes just minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed matrix @xmath7 ) , concurrence @xmath10 and @xmath34 which is connected to the fully entangled fraction . as we will see , qualitatively all behave in the same way . from the analytical viewpoint though",
    "@xmath34 is the simplest quantity and is therefore the best candidate for an analytical treatment .",
    "we are going to study entanglement evolution for various one dimensional spin hamiltonians consisting of @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles . to verify that the results do not depend on the underlying dynamics we will use both chaotic and integrable systems .",
    "heisenberg spin-@xmath36 model is an integrable model with hamiltonian @xmath37 we have checked that the results are similar for anisotropic heisenberg model as well as for isotropic heisenberg model in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "we can break integrability of the heisenberg model by applying magnetic field , for instance , a staggered field in @xmath38-direction , @xmath39 where the strength of the magnetic field is @xmath40 and @xmath41 on odd sites .    ) for @xmath42 .",

    "last model will be ising chain in tilted magnetic field , @xmath44 ising model in tilted magnetic field also displays typical signatures of quantum chaos  @xcite , similarly as its time - dependent kicked version  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the results are essentially the same also for integrable transverse ising model .",
    "as we will see , all three models will display similar evolution of entanglement being in turn equal to the one for a two - body random matrix model .",
    "therefore , our main focus will actually be on a two - body random matrix model , for which we have only nearest neighbor coupling terms , @xmath45 with @xmath46 acting nontrivially only on two qubits , for which it is a @xmath47 random hermitian matrix , same for all coupled pairs and normalized as @xmath48 .",

    "two qubits in question will be either nearest neighbors , that is qubits directly coupled by the hamiltonian , or two qubits which are not directly coupled , , next nearest neighbors .",
    "typically they will be chosen in the middle of the chain with the results being largely independent of their precise location .",
    "the initial pure state will be of two forms .",
    "most of the time we are going to consider random product initial state , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a random state of @xmath55th qubit , given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 independent random numbers given as @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 where all three @xmath61s are independent ( for each qubit ) uniform random numbers on interval @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "initially , at time @xmath63 , our initial state is always of product form between two qubits in question and therefore there wo nt be any entanglement , , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    ", one can use perturbation theory to calculate the reduced density matrix @xmath52 ( [ eq : rho ] ) . taking for @xmath67 nearest - neighbor hamiltonian with an arbitrary two - qubit coupling term",
    "@xmath68 we get after expanding propagator @xmath69 to the lowest order in time , @xmath70 in the derivation of the above formula we assumed the initial product state on the two qubits in question while an arbitrary state is allowed on the remaining @xmath1 qubits , @xmath71 .",

    "the fact that @xmath101 is for @xmath75 smaller than for @xmath100 is not a contradiction as @xmath110 does not necessarily mean that the entangelement of formation is zero  @xcite .",
    "we can see that due to randomness in the initial state the evolution of entanglement between two nearest - neighbor qubits shows universal - like behavior , that is time dependence which is to a large extend independent of the precise form of the underlying nearest - neighbor hamiltonian which generates evolution .",
    "universality is not exact , there are still `` signatures '' of specific hamiltonian at intermediate times ( for instance , compare curves for the heisenberg and ising model in fig .",

    "bell - like shape of entanglement is a consequence of two competing processes . on the one hand ,",
    "non - separable evolution naturally tends to produce entanglement from an initially separable state while on the other hand , it will tend to destroy it because @xmath111 will approach a random state as time grows and the reduced density matrix will approach an identity matrix having zero entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the later process of destroying entanglement has two sources : first , randomness of the initial state is spread out throughout the system and second , dynamics itself will tend to produce random state .",
    "universality is a consequence of randomness in the initial state , , of its generic separable form . for each hamiltonian",
    "there are rare specific separable initial states for which deviations from the above average behavior will be large .    as we have seen in fig .",

    "as one can see , for qubits which are not directly coupled by the hamiltonian , , @xmath113 and @xmath114 cases , @xmath75 is always less than @xmath94 .",
    "this happens because the production of entanglement depends on higher order terms , , for @xmath113 terms of form @xmath117 are needed , whereas for nearest - neighbors a single term @xmath46 is already sufficient to entangle two qubits . as a consequence ,",
    "entanglement production is slower the larger is the distance between qubits while entanglement destruction due to randomness is approximately independent of the distance . in all cases",

    "unfortunately it is not so .",
    "this rational dependence can not be explained by higher order perturbative calculation .",
