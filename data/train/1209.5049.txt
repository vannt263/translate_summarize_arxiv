    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite provides us a novel method to study the strongly coupled field theories through a weakly coupled gravitational system in one higher dimension . in recent years , the ads / cft correspondence has been used to mimic many basic phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as nernst effect  @xcite , superconductivity  @xcite and non - fermi liquid  @xcite . among these works ,",
    "the holographic superconductivity is the most studied subject , and various aspects of the holographic superconductors have been intensively discussed , such as the response to the magnetic field  @xcite , the meissner effect  @xcite , the behavior of the entanglement entropy  @xcite and the josephson junction  @xcite . for more details , please refer to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the little - parks ( lp ) effect was discovered in experiments with empty and thin - walled superconducting cylinders subjected to a parallel magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it states that certain thermodynamic quantities such as the critical temperature @xmath0 are periodic functions of the enclosed magnetic flux with period @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fundamental charge of carriers .",
    "while recently it was shown in the condensed matter literatures  @xcite that the lp period would be broken for small enough cylinder , the lp degeneracy and its uplifting have been realized holographically in  @xcite , where the wilson line @xmath3 along the compact direction is identified as a quantum hair .",
    "they found that the boundary field theory in a deconfined state dual to black brane is insensitive to the quantum hair , thus the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect is suppressed and the lp period appears .",
    "in contrast , the theory in the confining vacuum dual to the soliton is sensitive to the quantum hair , thus the ab effect is unsuppressed and there is no trace of the lp effect .",
    "this encouraging discovery motivates us to study the responses to a wilson line on a circle in the frame of gauss - bonnet gravity . in  @xcite",
    ", the effect of the wilson line has been studied in the einstein gravity background .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the modification of the bulk gravity may influence the response to the wilson line .",
    "the higher curvature corrections originated from the string theory can effectively describe quantum corrections in the bulk .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , such effects on the gravity side map to @xmath4 suppressed corrections in the large @xmath5 expansion of the boundary field theory .",
    "the studies of holographic superconductor with higher curvature corrections  @xcite indicate that such terms can quantitatively affect many properties of the boundary system .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the frequency gap over the critical temperature , i.e. , @xmath6 which was found to be universal in einstein gravity , breaks down . therefore , in this paper , we are interested in how the gauss - bonnet term changes the response to the wilson line .",
    "we study the responses in both ads black brane background which can mimic the holographic conductor / superconductor transition , and ads soliton background which can model the holographic insulator / superconductor transition .",
    "we work in the probe limit .",
    "our results show that the responses to wilson line are dramatically different between holographic conductor / superconductor phase transition and holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition .",
    "explicitly , for black brane , the lp periodicity still holds in the gauss - bonnet gravity and is independent of the gauss - bonnet parameter , while there is no evidence for the lp periodicity in the ads soliton case .",
    "these phenomena are similar to those in the einstein theory .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the impact of the gauss - bonnet term to the systems in detail .",
    "we find that with the change of the gauss - bonnet parameter , the corresponding physical quantities , such as the condensation and the current , display regular behaviors .",
    "in particular , at fixed chemical potential , the behaviors of condensation and current with respect to @xmath7 ( or equivalently wilson line @xmath3 ) are much more different in the two systems with the change of the gauss - bonnet parameter .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we construct the holographic model in section .",
    "[ sec.2 ] .",
    "we study the responses to the wilson line in the holographic conductor / superconductor model and the insulator / superconductor model in section .",
    "[ sec.3 ] and section .",
    "[ sec.4 ] , respectively . in the last section .",
    "[ sec.5 ] , we give some conclusions and discussions .",
    "let us start from the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with a negative cosmological constant coupled to a @xmath8 gauge field @xmath9 and a charged scalar field @xmath10 in 5-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the action reads @xmath11,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 the gravitational constant , @xmath13 the radius of the ads spacetime , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the quadratic curvature term is the gauss - bonnet term with @xmath16 the gauss - bonnet parameter . in order to compare with the results in  @xcite",
    ", we only consider the case with a massless scalar field . to mimic a boundary system compactified on a circle , we are interested in the geometry with one compact spatial direction labeled as @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in this paper",
    ", we will work at finite temperature @xmath19 , corresponding to a compact euclidean time direction with radius @xmath20 .",
    "the control parameter that we will consider in the holographic superconductor is a wilson line along the compact direction @xmath17 , with a constant non - trivial gauge vector potential @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath21 where the integral is calculated along the compact direction and @xmath2 is the fundamental charge .",
    "the wilson line on the material can be thought to be generated by the axial magnetic flux since the circulation of the gauge potential equals the magnetic flux enclosed by the path .",
    "one parameter that can characterize the response of @xmath3 is the fluxoid number @xmath22 where the integral is done along the compact direction and @xmath23 is the phase of the order parameter .    in general , we should solve the full coupled equations of motion , which are more complicated in the case with the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "however , we can get some qualitative features in the so - called probe limit .",
    "indeed , we can see from the action that in the limit @xmath24 , the back reaction of the gauge field and the complex scalar field can be neglected safely . for our case ,",
    "the simplest ansatz are as follows @xmath25 near the ads boundary @xmath26 , the scalar field and the maxwell field behave as @xmath27 from the ads / cft dictionary , the coefficients above can be related to physical quantities in the boundary field theory .",
    "@xmath28 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dual operator with @xmath29 the source which is set to be zero to accomplish the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are chemical potential and charge density , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is the vev of the @xmath8 current and @xmath33 plays the role of a gauge potential along the compact direction of the boundary material .",
    "the free energy @xmath34 can be obtained from the ads euclidean action @xmath35 evaluated with all the bulk fields on shell , which is used to determine which configuration is thermodynamically favorable .    in the next two sections",
    ", we will study the response to the wilson line in both five dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black brane and gauss - bonnet - ads soliton backgrounds .",
    "especially , we concentrate on the quantitative changes of boundary systems after turning on such quadratic curvature corrections in the bulk .",
    "the 5-dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black brane with a ricci flat horizon is described by  @xcite @xmath36 , \\\\",
    "f(z ) & = & \\frac{l^2}{2\\alpha}\\bigg(1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4\\alpha}{l^2}\\big ( 1-\\frac{z^4}{z_h^4}\\big)}\\bigg ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the horizon is located at @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature of the black brane is @xmath38 . in order to have a well - defined vacuum for the gravity theory",
    ", one has to have @xmath39 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath40 is called the chern - simons limit .",
    "if we further consider the causality constraint from the boundary cft , there is an additional constraint on the gauss - bonnet parameter with @xmath41  @xcite . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the temperature of the black hole is just the one of the dual field theory . in the following numerical calculations we will set @xmath42 .    assuming the matter field in the form of eq.([field_equation ] )",

    "this implies that the effective action of the boundary system will only depend on local gauge invariant quantities , and thus will display lp periodicity .",
    "this observation is confirmed by our subsequent numerical calculations .",
    "considering the scaling symmetry @xmath49 we can adjust the solutions to satisfy @xmath50 . and the corresponding scaling invariant variables are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and so on .",
    "the free energy of the system is @xmath54,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is used to determine which configuration is thermodynamically favored , where @xmath55 is the spatial volume of the black hole spanned by @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath17 .",

    "different color curves with period represent the value of condensation for different @xmath16 . from the top to the bottom , the curves with different colors correspond to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    fig.[fig1 ] shows the phase diagrams for the occurrence of superconductivity in the gauss - bonnet - ads black brane case . here",
    "we choose the gauss - bonnet parameter as @xmath62 , @xmath61 , @xmath60 , and @xmath59 in turn .",
    "although we introduce some kind of quantum corrections effectively described by gauss - bonnet term in the bulk , we can see from fig.[fig1 ] that the phase diagram displays a precise periodicity with period @xmath63 no matter the choice of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 .",
    "when the parameter @xmath16 vanishes , the system returns to the one in einstein theory . following the terminology in  @xcite , we conclude that the ab effects are suppressed for black brane background",
    ". however , the introduction of gauss - bonnet term can quantitatively affect other physical observables . for different @xmath16 , @xmath64 is different accordingly , where @xmath64 is the critical chemical potential denoting the occurrence of phase transition when @xmath65 ( without wilson line ) . for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ,",
    "the corresponding critical chemical potentials are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that as one increases the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 , @xmath64 increases accordingly , which makes the condensation more difficult to form for vanishing magnetic flux .",
    ".[table1 ] the coefficients @xmath74 for different gauss - bonnet parameters @xmath16 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from this table , we can find that with the increase of @xmath16 , the occurrence of the jumps move to the right .",
    "further , if we fix @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we see that the condensation @xmath28 is larger for larger @xmath16 .",
    "this property implies that with the increase of @xmath16 , the condensation gap becomes higher .",
    "this behavior is opposite to the black brane case discussed in the last section .    the behavior of the current @xmath75 as a function of @xmath33 at fixed @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath32 is the total current in superconducting phase .",
    "@xmath77 is a normal - phase persistent - current presenting in the soliton ( superconductor or not ) , which can be read from normal phase for vanishing @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is the contribution due to the @xmath8-breaking condensation .",
    "the position for every jump is the same as fig .",
    "apart from a small range near @xmath65 , for a given @xmath33 , the magnitude of the current increases with the increase of @xmath16 , which means that the boundary system corresponding to large @xmath16 is more sensitive to the response to wilson line .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the magnetic response of holographic superconductor in the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "concretely we have studied the response to a wilson line along the compact spatial direction of dual systems .",
    "as we know , the gauss - bonnet term effectively describes some kind of quantum correction in the bulk .",
    "according to ads / cft correspondence , such quantum correction maps to the @xmath4 corrections in the boundary theory .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how much such quantum corrections change the whole picture .",
    "our calculation shows that for a particular gauss - bonnet parameter , in the black brane background , the phase diagram and physical quantities , such as condensation and current , with different @xmath80 but equal @xmath81 , are degenerate , while in the soliton phase such degeneracy is uplifted .",
    "thus , we find that including the gauss - bonnet term does not modify the qualitative features observed in einstein theory .",
    "although the gauss - bonnet term can not break the lp periodicity in black brane background , other physical quantities in the two holographic systems are undoubtedly modified or affected with the change of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 , which is equivalent to tuning the strength of quantum corrections .",
    "we have analyzed the impact of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 on the response of wilson line in detail .",
    "more specifically , different gauss - bonnet parameters affect the involved physical quantities with the following fashion .    the critical chemical potential @xmath64 defined by transition point for vanishing @xmath7 increases as one increases the gauss - bonnet parameter , which makes the condensation more difficult for vanishing magnetic flux . for a given @xmath51 , the smaller the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 is chosen",
    ", the bigger @xmath76 is required to trigger the phase transition . for the black brane case ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath82 increases as we lower @xmath16 .    at fixed chemical potential",
    "compared to @xmath64 corresponding to each @xmath16 , the behaviors of condensation and current with respect to @xmath7 ( or equivalently to wilson line @xmath3 ) are much more different in the two systems with the change of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 . in the black brane case , we have found that the magnitudes of the condensation and current increase as one lowers the parameter @xmath16 , which means they are more sensitive to response to wilson line for smaller @xmath16 . on the other hand , in the soliton background case",
    ", the magnitude of such two physical quantities increases with the increase of @xmath16 , indicating that the response to wilson line is more insensitive for smaller @xmath16 .",
    "unlike the black brane case , there are jumps existing in the evolution of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are due to the fact that the topological sectors labeled by @xmath80 enter the effective field theory of the boundary theory . and the position of the jumps moves to larger chemical potential with the increase of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath16 .",
    "finally we point out that this work is done in the probe limit , the most direct improvement of the present analysis is to include the back reaction of the matter sector on the background geometry , but we expect the qualitative picture will not be changed .",
