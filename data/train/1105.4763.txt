    "under the influence of the solar wind , the magnetosphere resides in a complex , non - equilibrium state .",
    "the plasma particles have non - maxwellian velocity distribution , mhd turbulence is present everywhere , and intermittent energy transport known as bursty - bulk flows occurs as well @xcite .",
    "the magnetospheric response to particular solar events constitutes an essential aspect of space weather while the response to solar variability in general is often referred to as _ space climate _ @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches to space climate involve concepts and methods from stochastic processes , nonlinear dynamics and chaos , turbulence , self - organized criticality , and phase transitions .",
    "self - organization can lead to low - dimensional behavior in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "however , power - law dependence observed in the fourier spectra of the auroral electrojet ( ae ) index is a typical signature of high dimensional colored noise indicating multi - scale dynamics of the magnetosphere . in order to reconcile low - dimensional , deterministic behavior with high - dimensionality",
    ", @xcite proposed that a high - dimensional system near self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite can be characterized by a few parameters whose evolution is governed by a small number of nonlinear equations .",
    "some magnetospheric models , like the one presented in @xcite , are based on the soc - concept . here",
    "a system tunes itself to criticality and the energy transport across scales is mediated by avalanches which are power - law distributed in size and duration .    on the other hand ,",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the substorm dynamics can be described as a non - equilibrium phase transition ; i.e. as a system tuned externally to criticality . here , a power - law relation is given , with characteristic exponent close to the input - output critical exponent in a second - order phase transition .",
    "in fact , it is claimed in @xcite that the global features of the magnetosphere correspond to a first order phase transition whereas multi - scale processes correspond to the second- order phase transitions .",
    "the existence of metastable states in the magnetosphere , where intermittent signatures might be due to dynamical phase transitions among these states , was suggested by @xcite , and forced and/or self - organized criticality ( fsoc ) induced by the solar wind was introduced as a conceptual description of magnetospheric dynamics .",
    "the concept of intermittent criticality was suggested by @xcite who asserted that during intense magnetic storms the system develops long - range correlations , which further indicates a transition from a less orderly to a more orderly state .",
    "here , substorms might be the agents by which longer correlations are established .",
    "this concept implies a time - dependent variation in the activity as the critical point is approached , in contrast to soc .    in the present paper we investigate determinism and predictability of observables characterizing the state of the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms as well as during its quiet condition , but",
    "the emphasis is on the evolution of these properties over the course of major magnetic storms .",
    "the measure of determinism employed here increases if the system dynamics is dominated by modes governed by low - dimensional dynamics .",
    "hence , the determinism in most cases is a measure of low - dimensionality . for a low - dimensional , chaotic system",
    "the predictability measure increases when the largest lyapunov exponent increases , and hence it is really a measure of un - predictability . for a high - dimensional or stochastic system it is related to the degree of persistence in time",
    "series representing the dynamics .",
    "high persistence means high predictability .",
    "one of the most useful data tools for probing the magnetosphere during substorm conditions is the ae minute index which is defined as the difference between the au index , which measures the eastward electrojet current in the auroral zone , and the al index , which measures the westward electrojet current , and is usually derived from 12 magnetometers positioned under the auroral oval @xcite .",
    "the auroral electrojet , however , does not respond strongly to the specific modifications of the magnetosphere that occur during magnetic storms .",
    "a typical storm characteristic , however , is a change in the intensity of the symmetric part of the ring current that encircles earth at altitudes ranging from about 3 to 8 earth radii , and is proportional to the total energy in the drifting particles that form this current system @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath2 and sym - h indices are both designed for the study of storm dynamics .",
    "these indices contain contribution from the magnetopause current , the partial and symmetric ring current , the substorm current wedge , the magnetotail currents , and induced currents on the earth s surface .",
    "they are derived from similar data sources , but sym - h has the distinct advantage of having 1-min time resolution compared to the 1-hour time resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite has recommended that the sym - h index be used as a de facto high - resolution @xmath2 index .",
    "the analysis of these indices are central to this study .",
    "we particularly focus on sym - h and sym - h@xmath3 which is derived from the sym - h when the contribution of the magnetopause current is excluded .",
    "the typical magnetic storm consists of the initial phase , when the horizontal magnetic field suddenly increases and stays elevated for several hours , the main phase where this component is depressed for one to several hours , and the recovery phase which also lasts several hours .",
    "the initial phase has been associated with northward directed imf ( little energy enters the magnetosphere ) , but it has been discovered that this phase is not essential for the storm to occur @xcite . in order to define a storm , we follow the approach of @xcite , where the @xmath2 minimum is a common reference epoch , the main - phase decrease is sufficiently steep , and the recovery phase is also defined .",
    "the sym - h index data are downloaded from world data center , with 1-min resolution .",
    "we also use minute data for the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) component @xmath1 , minute data for the solar wind bulk velocity @xmath0 along the sun - earth axis , as well as flow pressure which is given in nt .",
    "these data are retrieved from the omni satellite database and are given in the gse coordinate system .",
    "gaps of missing data in @xmath1 , @xmath0 and flow pressure are linearly interpolated from the data which are not missing , while sym - h data are analyzed for the entire period .",
    "the same result for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 is obtained when gaps of missing data are excluded from the analysis .",
    "data for the period from january 2000 till december 2005 is used to compute general properties of the magnetosphere . in order to analyze storm conditions",
    "all the indices are analyzed during ten intense magnetic storms .",
    "analyzed storms occurred on 6 april 2000 , 15 july 2000 , 12 august 2000 , 31 march 2001 , 21 october 2001 , 28 october 2001 , 6 november 2001 , 7 september 2002 , 29 october 2003 , and 20 november 2003 .",
    "these storms are characterized with @xmath2 minimum which is in the range between -150 nt to -422 nt .",
    "+ the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the data analysis methods employed .",
    "section 3 presents analysis results discerning general statistical scaling properties of global magnetospheric dynamics using minute data over several years and data generated by a numerical model which produces realizations of a fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck ( fo - u ) process . in particular we study how determinism and predictability of the geomagnetic and solar wind observables change over the course of magnetic storms .",
    "section 4 is reserved for discussion of results and section 5 for conclusions .",
    "the recurrence plot is a powerful tool for the visualization of recurrences of phase - space trajectories .",
    "it is very useful since it can be applied to non - stationary as well as short time series @xcite , and this is the nature of data we use to explore magnetic storms . prior to constructing a recurrence plot",
    "the common procedure is to reconstruct phase space from the time - series @xmath4 of length @xmath5 by time - delay embedding @xcite .",
    "suppose the physical system at hand is a deterministic dynamical system describing the evolution of a state vector @xmath6 in a phase space of dimension @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 evolves according to an autonomous system of 1st order ordinary differential equations ; @xmath9 and that an observed time series @xmath4 is generated by the measurement function @xmath10 , @xmath11 assume that the dynamics takes place on an invariant set ( an attractor ) @xmath12 in phase space , and that this set has box - counting fractal dimension @xmath13 .",
    "since the dynamical system uniquely defines the entire phase - space trajectory once the state @xmath6 at a particular time @xmath14 is given , we can define uniquely an @xmath15-dimensional measurement function , @xmath16 where the vector components are given by equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , and @xmath17 is a time delay of our choice . if the invariant set @xmath18 is compact ( closed and bounded ) , @xmath19 is a smooth function and @xmath20 , the map given by equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is a topological embedding ( a one - to - one continuous map ) between @xmath18 and @xmath21",
    ". the condition @xmath20 can be thought of as a condition for the image @xmath22 not to intersect itself , i.e. to avoid that two different states on the attractor @xmath18 are mapped to the same point in the @xmath15-dimensional embedding space @xmath21 .",
    "if such an embedding is achieved , the trajectory @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is given by equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ) in the embedding space is a complete mathematical representation of the dynamics on the attractor .",
    "note that the dimension @xmath7 of the original phase space is irrelevant for the reconstruction of the embedding space .",
    "the important thing is the dimension @xmath13 of the invariant set @xmath18 on which the dynamics unfolds .",
    "there are practical constraints on useful choices of the time delay @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath17 is much smaller than the autocorrelation time the image of @xmath18 becomes essentially one - dimensional .",
    "if @xmath17 is much larger than the autocorrelation time , noise may destroy the deterministic connection between the components of @xmath25 , such that our assumption that @xmath6 determines @xmath25 will fail in practice .",
    "a common choice of @xmath17 has been the first minimum of the autocorrelation function , but it has been shown that better results are achieved by selecting the time delay as the first minimum in the average mutual information function , which can be percieved as a nonlinear autocorrelation function @xcite . here",
    "we use the average mutual information function to calculate the value of @xmath17 .",
    "the recurrence - plot analysis deals with the trajectories in the embedding space .",
    "if the original time series @xmath4 has @xmath5 elements , we have a time series of @xmath26 vectors @xmath25 for @xmath27 .",
    "this time series constitutes the trajectory in the reconstructed embedding space .",
    "the next step is to construct a @xmath28\\times [ ( n-(m-1)\\tau]$ ] matrix @xmath29 consisting of elements 0 and 1 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath30 is 1 if the distance is @xmath31 in the reconstructed space , and otherwise it is 0 . the recurrence plot is simply a plot where the points @xmath30 for which the corresponding matrix element is 1 is marked by a dot . for a deterministic system",
    "the radius @xmath32 is typically chosen as 10% of the diameter of the reconstructed attractor , but varies for different sets of data . for a non - stationary stochastic process like a brownian motion",
    "there is no bounded attractor for the dynamics , and the diameter is limited by the length of the data record .",
    "the first example of recurrence plot is shown in figure 1 , obtained from the @xmath1 when no storm is present on 5 september 2001 . in figure 2 ,",
    "the recurrence plot is shown for the @xmath1 for the strong storm on 6 april 2000 . in both cases ,",

    "emd method can give a change of frequency in any moment of time ( instantaneous frequency ) and a change of amplitude in the system .",
    "however , in order to properly define instantaneous frequency , a time series should have the same number of zero crossings and extrema ( or they can differ at most by one ) , and a local mean should be close to zero .",
    "the original time series usually does not have these characteristics and should be decomposed into intrinsic mode functions ( if ) for which instantaneous frequency can be defined .",
    "decomposition can be obtained through the so - called sifting process .",
    "this is an adaptive process derived from the data and can be briefly described as follows : all local maxima and minima in the time series @xmath36 are found , and all local maxima and minima are fitted by cubic spline and these fits define the upper ( lower ) envelope of the time series .",
    "then the mean of the upper and lower envelope @xmath37 is defined , and the difference between the time series and this mean represents the first if , @xmath38 , if instantaneous frequency can be obtained , defined by some stopping criterion . if not , the procedure is repeated ( now starting from @xmath39 instead of @xmath36 ) until the first if is produced .",
    "higher ifs are obtained by subtracting the first if from the time series @xmath36 and the entire previously mentioned procedure is repeated until a residual , usually a monotonic function , is left .",

    "@xcite analyzed telecommunication indices and noticed a resemblance to autoregressive processes of the first order ar(1 ) , which are stochastic and linear processes . for such processes @xmath55 . for fractional gaussian noise processes ( @xmath56 ) and fractional brownian motions ( @xmath57 ) we have the connection @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the hurst exponent , as shown by @xcite .",
    "a useful feature of the emd analysis is the possibility of extraction of trends in the time series @xcite , because the slowest if components should often be interpreted as trends .",
    "this is an advantage compared to the standard variogram or rescaled - range techniques @xcite , whose estimation of the scaling exponents is biased by the trend .      in this paper",
    "we employ a simple test for determinism , developed by @xcite , where the following hypothesis is tested : when a system is deterministic , the orientation of the trajectory ( its tangent ) is a function of the position in the phase space .",
    "further , this means that the tangent vectors of a trajectory which recurs to the same small `` box '' in phase space , will have the same directions since these are uniquely determined by the position in phase space .",
    "on the other hand , trajectories in a stochastic system have directions which do not depend uniquely on the position and are equally probable in any direction .",
    "this test works only for continuous flows , and is not applicable to maps since consecutive points on the orbit may be very separated in the phase space . for flows ,",
    "the trajectory orientation is defined by a vector of a unit length , whose direction is given by the displacement between the point where trajectory enters the box _",
    "j _ to the point where the trajectory exits the same box . the displacement in _",

    "in this subsection we develop an analysis which is based on the diagonal line structures of the recurrence plot . in our study",
    "we use the average inverse diagonal line length : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a histogram over diagonal lengths : @xmath110 for a low - dimensional , chaotic deterministic system ( for which the embedding dimension is sufficient to unfold the attractor ) @xmath90 is an analog to the largest lyapunov exponent , and is a measure of the _ degree of unpredictability_.    for stochastic systems , the recurrence plots do not have identifiable diagonal lines , but rather consists of a pattern of dark rectangles of varying size , as observed in figure 1 . for embedding dimension @xmath33",

    "brownian motions @xmath109 can be computed analytically , and @xmath90 computed as function of the selfsmilarity exponent @xmath116 . since the residence time @xmath115 inside an @xmath32-box increases as the smoothness of the trajectory increases ( increasing @xmath116 ) , we should find that @xmath117 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath116 .",
    "in section [ sec : predictabilityresults ] we compute @xmath117 numerically for a synthetically generated fo - u process and thus demonstrate this relationship between @xmath90 and @xmath116 .",
    "hence both @xmath90 and @xmath116 can serve as measures of predictability , but @xmath90 is more general , because it is not restricted to selfsimilar processes or processes with stationary increments , and applies to low - dimensional chaotic as well as stochastic systems .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the fluctuation amplitude ( or more precisely ; the one - timestep increment ) @xmath118 of the ae index is on the average proportional to the instantaneous value @xmath119 of the index .",
    "this gives rise to a special kind of intermittency associated with multiplicative noises , and leads to a non - stationary time series of increments .",
    "however , the time series @xmath120 is stationary , implying that the stochastic process @xmath121 has stationary increments .",
    "thus , a signal with stationary increments , which still can exhibit a multifractal intermittency , can be constructed by considering the logarithm of the ae index .",
    "similar properties pertain to the sym - h index , although in these cases we have to add a constant @xmath122 before taking the logarithm , i.e. @xmath123 has stationary increments .",
    "using the procedure described in @xcite the estimated coefficients are @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in figure 9a we show the increments for the original sym - h data , while in figure 9b we show the increments for the transformed signal @xmath4 , which in the following will be denoted tsym - h .      in this section , we employ emd and variogram analysis to tsym - h , imf @xmath1 and solar wind flow speed @xmath0 .",

    "this estimate for the slope seems valid for our data as well , as is shown in the figure from comparison with the variogram , even though the time series on scales up to @xmath130 minutes are non - stationary processes having the character of fractional brownian motions @xcite .",
    "the results from the two different methods shown in figures 10a and 10b are roughly consistent , using the relations @xmath131 and @xmath58 , which implies @xmath132 . in practice ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath129 from emd as a function of @xmath133 for fractional gaussian noises and motions with self - similarity exponent @xmath116 , and have derived a relation @xmath134 .",
    "the variogram represent a second order structure function : @xmath135 which scales with a time - lag @xmath62 as @xmath136 , @xmath116 is denoted as selfsimilarity exponent , and @xmath137 is a time series .",
    "note that a hurst exponent @xmath57 implies that the process is a nonstationary motion , and if the process is selfsimilar , the selfsimilarity exponent is @xmath131 . in our terminology",
    "a white noise process has hurst exponent @xmath138 and a brownian motion has @xmath139 .    from figure 10a",
    "we observe three different scaling regimes for tsym - h . for time scales",

    "the determinism ( as measured by @xmath152 ) of the storm index tsym - h and tsym - h@xmath3 has been shown to exhibit a pronounced increase at storm time .",
    "a rather trivial explanation of this enhancement would be that it is caused by the  trend \" incurred by the wedge - shaped drop and recovery of the storm indices associated with a magnetic storm .",

    "but what role will nonlinearity play if it is introduced in the deterministic terms of a stochastic equation ?",

    "this is shown in figure 16 .",
    "next , we test determinism for the nonlinear fo - u process , whose scaling exponent @xmath116 is estimated from the variogram of tsym - h , and where @xmath75 and @xmath172 is used .",

    "this fact demonstrates the robustness of the recurrence - plot analysis , which responds to changes in the dynamics of the system even if it is a stochastic or high - dimensional system for which no proper phase - space reconstruction is possible .",
    "since reduction in @xmath90 means increase of predictability it may also be a signature of higher persistence in a stochastic signal .",

    "the storm index sym - h and the solar wind observables ( flow velocity @xmath0 and imf @xmath1 ) show no clear signatures of low - dimensional dynamics during quiet periods",
    ". however , low - dimensionality increases in sym - h and sym - h@xmath3 during storm times , indicating that self - organization of the magnetosphere takes place during magnetic storms .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from the study of ten intense , magnetic storms in the period from 2000 - 2003 . even though our analysis shows no discernible change in determinism during magnetic storms for solar wind parameters",
    ", there is an enhancement of the predictability of the solar wind observables as well as the geomagnetic storm indices during major storms .",

    ", ions from the plasma sheet are flowing to the inner magnetosphere on the open drift paths and then move to the dayside magnetopause . in this storm",
    "phase the ring current is highly asymmetric , as was experimentally shown by energetic neutral atom imaging ( see @xcite and references therein ) . during the recovery phase ,",
    "ions from the plasma sheet are trapped on closed drift paths , and form the symmetric ring current .",
    "therefore , the increase in determinism of the ring - current ( sym - h@xmath3 ) during storms implies increased determinism in the plasma sheet as well .",
    "a magnetic storm is a coherent global phenomenon investing a vast region of the inner magnetosphere , and implying large scale correlation .",
    "the counterpart of this increase of coherence is the reduction of the spontaneous incoherent short time scale fluctuations .",
    "consequently , one should expect a reduction of the free degrees of freedom which implies an increase of determinism , i.e. the possible emergence of a low - dimensionality .",
    "analysis of predictability shows significant differences between @xmath35 on one hand , and @xmath0 and sym - h on the other .",
    "while the former is a non - stationary , slightly anti - persistent motion up to time scales of approximately 100 minutes , and a pink noise on longer time scales , the latter are slightly persistent motions on scales up to several days and noises on longer time scales .",
    "these differences indicate the different role the solar wind @xmath35 and the velocity @xmath0 play in driving the substorm and storm current systems ; @xmath35 is important in substorm dynamics which will be studied in a separate paper , while @xmath0 is a major driver of storms .",

    "<S> the storm index sym - h , the solar wind velocity @xmath0 , and interplanetary magnetic field @xmath1 show no signatures of low - dimensional dynamics in quiet periods , but tests for determinism in the time series indicate that sym - h exhibits a significant low - dimensional component during storm time , suggesting that self - organization takes place during magnetic storms . </S>",
    "<S> even though our analysis yields no discernible change in determinism during magnetic storms for the solar wind parameters , there are significant enhancement of the predictability and exponents measuring persistence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , magnetic storms are typically preceded by an increase in the persistence of the solar wind dynamics , and this increase is also present in the magnetospheric response to the solar wind . </S>"
