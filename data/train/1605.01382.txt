    "we have previously employed a _ fully empirical _ approach to calculating the intergalactic background light ( ibl ) to wavelengths up to 5 @xmath0 m by using observational data from deep galaxy surveys ( stecker , malkan & scully 2012 ( hereafter sms12 ) ; and scully , malkan & stecker 2014 ( hereafter sms14 ) ) ; for a similar approach , see also helgason & kashlinsky ( 2012 ) and khaire & srianand ( 2015 ) . here",
    "we extend our previous results from sms12 and sms14 , determining both the intergalactic background light ( ibl ) at longer wavelengths out to 850 @xmath0 m and the subsequent @xmath1-ray opacity of the universe out to multi - tev energies .",
    "the spectra of astrophysical sources of such high energy @xmath1-rays  are being studied by ground - based air erenkov telescopes and linked air erenkov telescope arrays .",
    "we accomplish the goals of this paper by using very recent deep galaxy survey data at far infrared wavelengths where galaxy emission is produced by dust re - radiation rather than starlight .",
    "we also include the @xmath1-ray  opacity from photons of the 2.7 k cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "this enables us to extend our calculations of the @xmath1-ray  opacity of the universe to energies much greater than a tev .",
    "observations at wavelengths greater than 24 @xmath0 m , have been covered by the multiband imaging photometer on the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( mips ) , now being dramatically advanced by the availability of data from the photoconductor array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) and spectral photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) instruments on the _ herschel _ space telescope , the _ planck _ space telescope , and by ground - based observations from the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and observations from the balloon - borne large aperture submillimeter telescope ( blast ) .",
    "by using only empirical data rather that modeling , our approach is , by definition , _",
    "model independent_. we use published luminosity functions and interpolations of luminosity densities between observed wavebands , observations from high - redshift galaxy surveys being now sufficient for this purpose .",
    "most past approaches to determining the ibl and its present - day spectral energy distribution , referred to as the `` extralgalactic background light ( ebl ) '' , require assumptions about how the galaxy luminosity functions evolve ( _ e.g. _ malkan & stecker 1998 , 2001 ; kneiske , mannheim & hartmann , 2002 : stecker , malkan & scully 2006 ( sms06 ) ; franceschini et al .",
    "2008 ; finke , razzaque , & dermer , 2010 ; kneiske & dole 2010 ) .",
    "other approaches make use of semi - analytic models that require various assumptions regarding galaxy evolution , stellar population synthesis modeling , or star formation rates the properties of and dust attenuation , particularly for redshifts greater than 1 ( _ e.g. _ , salamon & stecker 1998 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2009 ; somerville et al .",
    "2012 ; dominguez et al . 2011 ; inoue et al . 2013 ; driver et al .",
    "in contrast , our observationally - based approach is superior to model - based methods , since it enables a determination of both the ibl _ and its observational uncertainties_. this is because we use observationally determined errors .",
    "approaches that rely on modeling can not determine such uncertainties .",
    "observational studies of blazar @xmath1-ray spectra have also been used to probe the ibl ( ackermann et al .",
    "2012 ; abramowski et al . 2013 ; biteau & williams 2015 ) through its opacity effect caused by electron - positron pair production .",
    "this approach was originally suggested by stecker , de jager & salamon ( 1992 ) when the infrared ebl was unknown .",
    "our present method of determining the expected @xmath1-ray  opacity of the universe by first using observational data to determine the ibl and then calculating its effect on @xmath1-ray  spectra of extragalactic sources complements the technique of using direct @xmath1-ray  observations .",
    "this is because the later approach requires a thorough knowledge of the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) emission spectra of the @xmath1-ray  sources .",
    "this requirement introduces unavoidable uncertainties .",
    "our final results give the @xmath1-ray  opacity as a function of energy and redshift to within a 68% confidence band that is based on observational data .",
    "this opacity is solely caused by pair - production interactions of ibl photons with extragalactic @xmath1-rays  .",
    "thus , a direct comparison of this effect with @xmath1-ray  spectra of extragalactic sources enables an assessment of possible additional spectral modifications .",
    "one such possible spectral modification has been suggested to be caused by secondary @xmath1-ray  production from cosmic - ray interactions along the line of sight to the source ( essey & kusenko 2014 ) .",
    "another such modification might be caused by photon - axion oscillations during propagation from the source to the earth ( _ e.g. _ , de angelis et al .",
    "2007 ; mayer & horns 2013 ) .    in section 2",
    "we give the details of our calculations of upper and lower limits on ir galaxy luminosity densities for wavelengths between 5 @xmath0 m  and 850 @xmath0 m  as a function of redshift , paying particular attention to the effects of the emission spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . in section 3",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 ebl based on the results from section 2 and compare it with both other work and observational limits . in section 4",
    "we compute the resulting opacity of the universe to @xmath1-rays  out to a redshift of z = 5 , including the total opacity from @xmath3 interactions with both ibl and thermal cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) photons . in our conclusion section ,",
    "section 5 , we compare our results with those obtained by other methods in some of the papers mentioned above .",
    "we also discuss the implications of our results .",
    "we have previously calculated the intergalactic background light ( ibl ) as a function of redshift in the far ultraviolet to near infrared range , based purely on data from deep galaxy surveys ( sms12 ; sms14 ) . here",
    "we utilize similar methods to extend the calculation into the mid- and far infrared ibl out to a wavelength of 850 @xmath0 m .      in our previous work",
    "the observationally tolerated ranges of photon densities were determined from the luminosity densities ( lds ) , @xmath4 , themselves , with errors provided by the various authors at wavelengths ranging from the far uv to the 5 @xmath0 m  wavelength in the near ir .",
    "the lds are computed by integrating fits to the observationally determined luminosity functions : @xmath5 cases where authors did not directly compute the lds were excluded because properly estimating their error requires knowledge of the covariance of the errors in the fit parameters of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) and also knowledge of any observational biases . to provide comprehensive redshift coverage of the lds , sms12 and sms14 made use of continuum colors between the wavelength bands to fill in any gaps .    at wavelengths greater than 5 @xmath0 m",
    "very few studies provide determinations of luminosity densities ( lds ) directly , as most authors are more concerned with calculating the _ total _ ir density , integrated over all wavelengths .",
    "this is because the total ir density is an observable that is correlated with the star formation rate .",
    "therefore , in this paper we used observer - given analytic fits to the lfs at various wavelengths .",
    "when those fits were not provided , we ourselves fit the observed infrared galaxy lfs at various wavelengths and redshifts and then use equation ( [ lumdens ] ) to obtain the lds .",
    "galaxy lfs typically have characteristic shapes that are flatter at lower luminosities but fall off more steeply at the highest luminosities .",
    "however , at wavelengths greater than 5 @xmath0 m  the schechter function , commonly used at optical wavelengths , does not provide a good fit to the observed lfs , as its exponential decrease falls off too quickly at the bright end compared with the measured lfs .",
    "most observers instead fit their lfs to a broken power - law function that describes the data better ( e.g. , marchetti et al . 2016 ) .",
    "the transition region between the power law that holds at low luminosities and that holding at high luminosities is usually referred to as the _ knee _ of the lf .",
    "the luminosity at the knee is usually designated as @xmath6 .",
    "most of the luminosity density from an lf is produced by galaxies with luminosities in the vicinity of the knee ; much fainter galaxies do not contribute much to the ld and the much brighter ones are quite rare .",
    "thus , it is critical to determine the location of the knee in order to estimate the lds with any accuracy .    for the cases where we were required to determine our own fits , we chose a double power - law fitting function of the form : @xmath7 here , the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the indices of the power - law fits in the low luminosity and high luminosity ranges respectively .",
    "the overall normalization of the lf is given by the parameter @xmath10 , which has the dimension of luminosity per mpc@xmath11dex .",
    "to compute the lds , we integrate equation ( [ lumdens ] ) over the galaxy luminosities between 4 @xmath12 10@xmath13 l@xmath14 and 10@xmath15 l@xmath14 .    in order to accurately compute the errors in the lds as derived from the fit parameters , which is essential for our calculation ,",
    "we must do so in a way that includes terms involving the off - diagonal elements of the error matrix of the fits so as to account for covariance . in cases where the authors provided there own fits ,",
    "we have therefore re - derived the fits of the lfs to generate the error matrix , retaining the same choice of fitting function and fixed parameters , if given .",
    "our goal , as in sms12 and ssm14 , was to compute the observationally tolerated ranges of luminosity densities .",
    "this requires that we represent the error on these quantities as best we can .",
    "the statistical error is determined by properly propagating the fit parameter errors accounting for covariance , lest we overestimate the error . to compute the total error on each ld",
    ", we further added in quadrature an additional systematic error that accounts for cosmic variance .",
    "we compute cosmic variance based on the field sizes of the individual studies .",
    "for the _ _ akari _ wide field ir survey explorer ( wise ) _ and _ goods _ fields this value is typically of order of 10% . in determining the lds , for consistency , all observational lfs",
    "are scaled to a hubble parameter of @xmath16    our new additions to our observationally determined lds extend our coverage of rest frame galaxy photon production from the near ir to 850 @xmath0 m  in the far ir , with enough determinations at each wavelength band to span the redshift range @xmath17 . using published results derived from observations by the _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ space telescopes , sufficient redshift coverage was found for wavelength bands of @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath0 m  .",
    "there were two cases where we were required to combine lfs from different observational studies in order to provide enough coverage to discriminate the location of @xmath6 particularly for redshifts greater than @xmath20 .",
    "at 12 @xmath0 m we combined the results of perez - gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and rodighiero et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to compute lds in redshift bins centered on redshifts of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in order to achieve sufficient redshift coverage at @xmath23 @xmath0 m we combined some of the higher redshift @xmath24 @xmath0 m  data from lapi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with that of the @xmath23 @xmath0 m  data from gruppioni et al .",
    "this gains us additional coverage at redshifts of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    at 160 , 350 , 500 , and 850 @xmath0 m",
    ", lf data only exists for the very nearby redshifts .",
    "we therefore assumed that their redshift evolution closely follows that of the 250 @xmath0 m  band ( lapi et al .",
    "2011 ; marchetti et al . 2016 ) .",
    "we use local lds calculated in those bands as a normalization to this evolution .",
    "this assumption is justified because the emission in this wavelength region is dominated by warm dust . at 160 @xmath0 m  we used the local lf given",
    "be patel et al .",

    "we computed the local ld from the lf provided by negrello et al .",
    "figures [ lumdens1 ] and [ lumdens2 ] show the resulting derived values for @xmath27 and their errors together with the observationally determined @xmath28 1 @xmath29 confidence bands for the 8 , 12 , 15 , 24 @xmath0 m  bands and those of 35 , 60 , 90 , and 250 @xmath0 m  respectively .    our calculations of lds at mid - ir to far - ir wavelengths presented here is an extension of the work done in sms12 and ssm14 .",
    "thus , the results given in those papers for wavelengths less than 5 @xmath0 m  is almost unchanged from the results presented here .",
    "however , we have updated the far uv calculations to include the more recent work from bouwens et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for lds in the redshift range of @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "even though the shape of the far uv band can affect other bands when filling in for redshift gaps using colors , the overall calculation yields results that are qualitatively the same as those presented in sms12 and ssm14 , as the newer data do not significantly change the general trend .    in order to place 68% upper and lower limits by using observational data on @xmath4 we make as few assumptions about the luminosity density evolution as possible .",
    "in sms12 and sms14 we utilized a robust rational fitting function in the form of a broken power - law dependent on @xmath32 in order to generate the confidence bands .",
    "we take the 68% confidence ranges of these fits in each waveband as the @xmath281 @xmath29 confidence bands for the lds . at redshifts beyond the redshift at the peak of star formation ,",
    "the lds decline with redshift . in accord with recent studies of the evolution of rest frame lfs in the uv that trace the star formation rate ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2015 ) , we conservatively assume upper and lower limit power - law functions in redshift to represent the rate of this decline as the highest redshifts . in the upper limit case",
    ", we assume a decline proportional to @xmath33 . in the lower limit case",
    ", we adopt a steeper decline proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "these assumptions have almost no impact on the derivation of the opacity confidence bands that we determined . figures [ lumdens1 ] and [ lumdens2 ] show our results for lds as a function of redshift at various wavelengths .      at wavelengths greater than @xmath3520 @xmath0 m",
    "the lds between the bands can be determined by smoothly interpolating between our observationally based lds at specific wavelengths , since the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from galaxies in this wavelength range are smooth modified blackbody spectra produced by dust re - radiation . however , in the 5  20 @xmath0 m  range the situation is more complex .    in star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the spectra between 7 and 13 @xmath0 m are dominated primarily by pah emission .",
    "these pah molecules are found in very small dust grains in intergalactic media .",
    "they absorb the uv photons emitted by hot young @xmath36 and @xmath37 stars and reemit them in molecular emission bands in the mid - ir .",
    "they are thus a strong signature of active star formation in galaxies ( peeters , spoon & tielens 2004 ) . in this regard",
    ", we note that luminous star forming galaxies at higher redshift have more prominent pah emission features .",
    "the importance of pah features in the mid - ir at redshifts @xmath38 has been shown by lagache et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the average sed of nearby star - forming galaxies ( from spoon et al .",
    "2007 , see also smith et al . 2007 ) is shown in figure [ pah ] normalized to our best fit low redshift ld confidence band .",
    "one can see that there is a relative `` valley '' between 9 and 11 @xmath0 m .",
    "a simple direct interpolation between our 8 and 12 @xmath0 m bands would therefore obtain an incorrectly high value for the ld in this wavelength range .",
    "since we do not have wavelength coverage in this regime , we take this feature into account by lowering our interpolated lds by a factor of 3 for the upper limit and a factor of 5 for the lower limit at 10 @xmath0 m  .",
    "the factor of 5 is chosen as a lower limit based on the difference between the peak at 8 @xmath0 m  and the depth of the valley near 10 @xmath0 m  from the sed .",
    "for the upper limit , we relax the depth of this feature because , while star forming galaxies make up the bulk of the ibl , contributions from other galaxy types have a less pronounced pah feature . since , at high redshifts , pah emission correlates with the star formation rate ( shipley et al .",
    "2016 ) , we assume that our relative pah shape factors of 3 and 5 coevolve with redshift .",
    "at wavelengths above @xmath35 100 @xmath0 m  the firas and dirbe instruments aboard the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( cobe ) have measured the ebl ( fixsen et al . 1998 ; lagache et al .",

    "these more recent studies strongly support the cobe results .    however , there are no direct measurements of the ebl in the infrared range below @xmath35 100 @xmath0 m  owing to the predominance of the foreground radiation of zodiacal light from interplanetary dust re - radiation .",
    "the flux of zodiacal light is approximately two orders - of - magnitude larger than the ebl flux ( spiesman et al .",

    "note that at the higher energies and redshifts where the opacity is dominated by interactions with crb photons , the uncertainty band becomes a very thin line , since the cbr - dominated opacity is exactly determined by equation ( [ cbr ] ) .",
    "ten years ago we made estimates the diffuse infrared background when hardly any mid - ir and far - ir luminosity functions had been observationally determined at high redshifts ( sms06 ) . that work was therefore based on the assumptions of a",

    "thus , we find no evidence for modifications of @xmath1-ray  spectra by processes other than absorption by pair production , either by cosmic - ray interactions along the line of sight to the source ( essey & kusenko 2014 ) or line - of - sight photon - axion oscillations during propagation ( _ e.g. _ , de angelis et al . 2007 ; mayer & horns 2013 ) .",
    "in this regard , we note that the _ fermi _ collaboration has very recently searched for irregularities in the @xmath1-ray  spectrum of ngc 1275 that would be caused by photon - axion oscillations and reported negative results ( ajello et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "we conclude that modification of the high energy @xmath1-ray  spectra of extragalactic sources occurs dominantly by pair production interactions of these @xmath1-rays  with photons of the ibl .",
    "they therefore support the concept of using the future _ erenkov telescope array _",
    "instruments to probe the cosmic background radiation fields at infrared wavelengths .",
    "this method can be used in conjunction with future deep galaxy survey observations using the near infrared and mid - infrared instruments aboard the _ james webb space telescope_."
