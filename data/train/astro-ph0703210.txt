    "so far , surveys at sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) wavelengths have covered only tiny fractions of the sky ( less than @xmath1 ) down to mjy levels ( mortier et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "forthcoming experiments , however , will enormously extend the sky coverage .",
    "the legacy surveys with scuba-2 include a shallow survey ( sassy ) of @xmath2 to a depth of 150 mjy ( @xmath3 ) and a wide - area extragalactic surveym has been combined with the deep @xmath4 m survey .",
    "the joint programme , known as the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey ( www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/@xmath5pvdwerf/pdf/scuba2-cls.pdf ) , has two elements : an @xmath6 m survey of @xmath7 to a @xmath3 limit of 3.5 mjy and a deeper @xmath4 m survey of @xmath8 to a @xmath3 limit of 2.5 mjy . ] of @xmath9 to a @xmath3 flux limit of 2 mjy , both at @xmath6 m .",
    "the spire instrument on esa s herschel satellite may be able to carry out a shallow survey of @xmath10 to a 100 mjy level ( @xmath3 ) in all three bands ( 250 , 350 , and @xmath11 m ; lagache et al .",
    "2003 ; harwit 2004 ) .",
    "the hfi instrument ( lamarre et al . 2003 ) on the planck satellite will carry out all sky surveys in 6 bands , centered at 3000 , 2100 , 1380 , 850 , 550 , and 350 @xmath12 m ; these surveys will be confusion limited to flux levels ranging from a few hundred mjy to @xmath13jy ( vielva et al . 2003 ; negrello et al . 2004 ; lpez - caniego et al .",
    "2006 ) .    as first pointed out by blain ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the sub - mm region is exceptionally well suited to exploit strong gravitational lensing to detect large complete samples of high - redshift dusty galaxies .",
    "the reason resides in the combined effect of the large and negative k - correction , that makes the observed flux density of sources of given luminosity only weakly dependent on distance over a broad redshift range above @xmath14 ( blain & longair 1993 ) , and of very steep evolution .",
    "these two ingredients cooperate in yielding large lensing optical depths and extremely steep counts , resulting in a strong magnification bias .",
    "strong lensing is a powerful tool for many interesting applications ( see kochanek 2004 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "the statistics of lenses is a test of the cosmological model because the optical depth is roughly proportional to the volume to the source .",
    "if the redshifts of both the source and the lens are measured , the ratio between the lens - source and observer - source angular diameter distances , @xmath15 , constitutes a sensitive probe of the geometry of the universe ( and in particular of @xmath16 , with weak dependence on @xmath17 ) through the scaling of light - ray deflections with the source redshift . to date , in the best studied cases , the lens is a low redshift cluster such as a1689 or a2218 , and this test is difficult to apply because , for high redshift sources , @xmath15 is always @xmath18 and the effect of different cosmologies is very small . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case of the sub - mm selected sources , the lenses are expected to be generally at substantial redshifts .",
    "the distribution of lens redshifts provides a further , potentially powerful , cosmological test since , in general , cosmologies with a large cosmological constant predict significantly higher lens redshifts than those without .",
    "recent analyses of lens statistics have focussed on the class survey ( see e.g. , mitchell et al .",
    "2005 ) to derive constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "attempts to use the lens statistics to constrain dark energy have been worked out by chae et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kuhlen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the probability that a source has an intervening lens also depends on the distribution of the lens galaxies , and the cross section of the lens for producing a given effect depends on its velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , if a cosmological model is adopted , the lens statistics is informative on the evolution of galaxy properties , and in particular of dark matter structures .",
    "note that gravitational lenses are unique in providing a selection based on mass , rather than luminosity , so that the separation distribution of lenses is a direct mapping of the mass function of all halos , luminous or dark .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) have found that a substantial fraction of sub - mm bright galaxies harbor an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the magnification produced by gravitational lensing allows us to study fainter agn host galaxies than otherwise possible .",
    "this will permit a better understanding of the growth of super - massive black holes and their relationships with their host galaxies .",
    "another important driver of large - area sub - mm surveys is the investigation of the clustering properties of high-@xmath19 galaxies , both in the 1-halo and in the 2-halo regimes , that can be performed more effectively than in other wavebands , and without being affected by obscuration effects .",
    "the large scale angular correlation function of detected sources and the autocorrelation function of intensity fluctuations provide information on the masses of dark matter halos , on the duration of the star - formation process and on the evolution of the bias factor .",
    "they are also sensitive to , and will provide constraints on cosmological parameters .    furthermore , these large area surveys will yield complete samples of sub - mm selected low-@xmath19 dusty galaxies , allowing , for the first time , direct estimates of the local luminosity functions .",
    "in addition , they may contain a number of extreme luminosity distant galaxies .",
    "another interesting , although only seldom mentioned , product of large - area sub - mm surveys are complete samples of radio sources , selected in a spectral region almost unexplored so far , but where key information on their physics is expected to show up .",
    "for example , observations at these wavelengths may reveal the transition from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron emission in the most compact regions , allowing the determination of the self - absorption ( turnover ) frequency which carries information on physical parameters . also , the slope of the optically thin synchrotron emission steepens at high frequencies due to electron energy losses ; the spectral break frequency @xmath20 is related to the strength of the magnetic field and to the ` synchrotron age ' @xmath21 by @xmath22ghz .",
    "excess far - ir / sub - mm emission possibly due to dust , is often observed from radio galaxies ( knapp & patten 1991 ) .",
    "these surveys will allow us to assess whether this is a general property of these sources , with interesting implications for the presence of dust in the host galaxies , generally identified with giant ellipticals , usually devoid of interstellar matter .",
    "the dominant radio source population at the relevant frequencies is made of flat - spectrum radio quasars and of bl lac objects , collectively dubbed ` blazars ' .",
    "multifrequency surveys in the far - ir / sub - mm region will allow us to check , e.g. , whether there are systematic differences in the turnover frequencies between bl lacs and flat - spectrum quasars as expected if the bl lac emission is angled closer to the line of sight , so that the turnovers are doppler boosted to higher frequencies .    correlations between turnover frequency and luminosity , which is also boosted by relativistic beaming effects , may be expected .",
    "on the other hand , fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ghisellini et al . ( 1998 ) found an anti - correlation between the frequency of the synchrotron peak of blazars and their radio luminosity , referred to as ` the blazar sequence ' .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of the most luminous blazars appear to peak at ( rest - frame ) mm wavelengths , while the peak moves towards optical wavelengths as the luminosity decreases .",
    "this sequence , if confirmed , is an important breakthrough in our understanding of the physical processes governing the blazar emission . on the other hand , antn & browne ( 2005 )",
    "find that most of their low - luminosity flat - spectrum radio sources peak at much lower frequencies than expected from the fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relationship .",
    "also , nieppola et al . (",
    "2006 ) did not find any correlation between luminosity and frequency of the synchrotron peak for their sample of 300 blazars .",
    "however , only a limited region of the luminosity - peak frequency plane has been explored to date , mostly due to the dearth of data in the far - ir to mm region , and the samples have been collected from different surveys and are not complete .",
    "in this paper we address all these important aspects . after an overview of the expected counts of extragalactic sources at sub - mm wavelengths (  2 ) , we present a comparative study of the potential of these surveys in relation to : the selection of strongly lensed , dusty primordial galaxies (  3 ) , the clustering properties of sub - mm sources at high redshifts (  4 ) , and the selection of the first complete sub - mm samples of local star - forming galaxies and of radio sources , mainly blazars (  5 ) . in ",
    "6 we summarize and discuss our main conclusions .",
    "this investigation may help in guiding us on what to expect and in optimizing the survey programmes .    throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt the `` concordance model '' , i.e. a flat @xmath23cdm cosmology with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and an index @xmath29 for the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations .",

    "sub - millimeter extragalactic sources are a mixed bag of various populations of dusty galaxies and of flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "a summary of the models adopted for each population follows .",
    "dusty galaxies detected at mjy levels by scuba and mambo surveys are modelled following granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who interpret them as proto - spheroidal galaxies in the process of forming most of their stars in a gigantic starburst lasting 0.3  1 gyr ( depending on redshift and on the halo mass ) .",
    "this physical model predicts the birth rate of galaxies as a function of cosmic time and the evolution with galactic age of their full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , from radio to x - ray wavelengths , including the effect of the active nucleus , whose growth is closely tied to the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "it is thus strongly constrained by , and indeed accounts for huge amounts of multifrequency data at different redshifts ( silva et al . 2005 ; cirasuolo et al .",
    "2005 ; shankar et al .",
    "2006 ; granato et al .",
    "2006 ; lapi et al .",
    "in particular , it fits the @xmath0 m counts available at the time ( granato et al .",
    "2004 ) and the data on the redshift distribution ( fig .",
    "[ 850nz ] ) .    however , the re - analysis of existing blank - field scuba surveys by scott et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the results of the scuba half - degree extragalactic survey ( coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) converge in yielding lower counts than previous studies . to match these more recent results ,",
    "we have scaled the @xmath0 m fluxes of granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) by a factor of 0.68 , thus preserving the agreement with the shape of the redshift distribution .",
    "most recently , aretxaga et al . ( 2007 ) compared the redshift distribution of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey ( shades ) , derived from rest - frame radio - mm - far ir colours , with those yielded by the four different galaxy formation models studied by van kampen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and with the semi - analytic models by baugh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and by granato et al .",
    "only the latter model turned out to be compatible , within the uncertainties , with the data , although if sources detected only at @xmath0 m are introduced in the redshift probability distribution with other priors , two of the models considered by van kampen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) can come closer to acceptable .",
    "the granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model is meant to take into account the star formation occurring within galactic dark - matter halos virialized at @xmath32 and bigger than @xmath33 , which are , crudely , associated to spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we envisage disks ( and irregulars ) as associated primarily to halos virializing at @xmath34 , which have incorporated , through merging processes , a large fraction of halos less massive than @xmath35 virializing at earlier times , which may become the bulges of late type galaxies .",
    "the contributions of the latter galaxies to the number counts are estimated following , as usual , a phenomenological approach , which consists in simple analytic recipes to evolve their local luminosity functions ( lfs ) , and appropriate templates for their seds to compute k - corrections and to extrapolate the models to different wavelengths where direct determinations of the local luminosity functions are not available .",
    "we have adopted the @xmath36 m local lfs by saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , that have been derived for `` warm '' and `` cold '' galaxies ( based on iras colors ) that we associate , respectively , to starburst and spiral galaxies .",
    "transformations to longer wavelengths were done using the mean flux ratios determined by serjeant & harrison ( 2005 ) who extrapolated the iras detections using the sub - mm colour temperature relations from the scuba local universe survey ( dunne et al .",
    "2000 ; dunne & eales 2001 ) .",
    "rather detailed information on dusty galaxies at redshifts @xmath37 came from the isocam cosmological surveys performed with the lw3 filter , centered at @xmath38 m ( see lagache et al .",
    "2005 for a review ) .",
    "various phenomenological models proposed to account for these data have been compared and discussed by gruppioni et al .",

    "gruppioni et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also allowed for non - evolving normal spirals and for type 1 active galactic nuclei evolving in luminosity .",
    "the latter population , however , yields a very small contribution to the @xmath38 m counts ( as well as to the sub - mm counts ) and can be neglected here . on the other hand , chemo / spectrophotometric evolution models for normal disc galaxies ( mazzei et al .",
    "1992 ; matteucci 2006 ) indicate a mild increase of the star formation rate , hence of ir luminosity , with look - back time . in view of that , silva et al .",

    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that the amplification distribution derived by perrotta et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is probably low because it neglects the effect of the halo substructure .",

    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ powerspspire ] where the clustering signal is compared with competing astrophysical sources , namely the poisson fluctuations due to the combination of all populations of extragalactic sources fainter than the detection limit , and to galactic dust emission . to deal with the latter we have used the finkbeiner et al .",

    "on the contrary , the possibility of taking full advantage of the herschel / spire resolution to learn about the non - linear clustering regime ( whose onset is marked by the high - multipole inflection point ) is seriously constrained by poisson fluctuations .        while the much larger area covered by planck allows , in principle , a much more accurate estimate of the power spectrum of the clustering signal , this advantage is largely impaired by the contamination by galactic dust emission . for example , even if we restrict ourselves to the @xmath159 around the galactic polar regions ( @xmath160 ) , the interstellar dust emission power spectrum blurs the clustering contribution for multipoles @xmath161 at @xmath162 m and for @xmath163 at @xmath58 m ( fig .",

    "the effect of galactic dust decreases substantially at @xmath0 m , but then the power spectrum is dominated by cmb anisotropies up to @xmath164 .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to select regions of @xmath165 where the galactic dust contamination is much lower and below the clustering signal down to @xmath166 at @xmath162 m and to @xmath161 at @xmath58 m .",

    "but since a key scientific goal is the identification of the synchrotron peak frequency , a broad spectral coverage is essential and large area surveys at herschel / spire wavelengths would also be extremely valuable .",
    "a @xmath62 survey to a flux limit of @xmath169mjy is expected to provide a _",
    "complete _ sample of @xmath182 blazars detected at each spire wavelength .",
    "as explained in  3 , the radio source populations can be easily identified by a positional cross correlation with radio catalogues , covering the whole sky at at least 2 frequencies .",

    "we find that planck / hfi surveys are confusion limited at bright flux levels , with @xmath183 confusion noise increasing from @xmath184mjy at @xmath0 m to @xmath185mjy at @xmath58 m . these surveys will thus be not sufficiently deep to detect with good signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath186 ) high-@xmath19 galaxies , except in the case of extreme gravitational magnifications or exceptionally high luminosities .",
    "they will however , provide complete samples of hundreds low-@xmath19 star - forming ( starburst and normal late - type ) galaxies , enabling a direct , accurate , determination of their local luminosity functions at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "in addition , they will detect , at least at @xmath0 m , several hundreds blazars , providing important information on their physical properties .",
    "although the number of sub - mm sources of each population detected by planck is too small to allow a measurement of their angular correlation function ( unless their clustering is far stronger than indicated by current data ) , the planck maps will allow accurate determination of the autocorrelation function of intensity fluctuations due to clustering of proto - spheroidal galaxies .",
    "it will however be difficult to take full advantage of planck s sky coverage because of the contamination by galactic dust .",
    "even at @xmath160 , the galactic dust power spectrum is expected to overwhelm that of clustering for multipole numbers @xmath187 in the @xmath58 m channel and for @xmath188 in the @xmath61 m channel ( see fig .",
    "[ powersphfi ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the useful range of angular scales provides precise information on the bias parameter of halos hosting the sub - mm sources , hence on their masses .",
    "there are however smaller low - dust regions where the clustering power spectrum may dominate over that of galactic dust down to @xmath189500 at @xmath162 m and at @xmath58 m , respectively .",
    "such regions are large enough to allow us to investigate the regime where the shape of the clustering power spectrum is sensitive to the cosmological parameters ( especially to the baryon density and to the matter density ) , so that its accurate determination sets interesting constraints on them . at @xmath0 m",
    ", the dominant signal up to @xmath190 is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . for high multipoles",
    ", @xmath191 , planck s ability to measure the power spectrum hits the limit set by angular resolution ; however , already at somewhat lower multipoles ( @xmath192 ) poisson fluctuations overcome the clustering ones .",
    "one might expect that , thanks to its much higher angular resolution ( compared to planck / hfi ) herschel / spire can remove much more efficiently point sources and thus substantially decrease the poisson fluctuation level .",
    "however , while it is obviously true that herschel / spire can reach much fainter detection limits , the very steep sub - mm counts of proto - spheroidal and starburst galaxies imply that the dominant contribution to poisson fluctuations come from the still fainter fluxes where the slope of integral counts flattens below the critical value @xmath193 . thus while , in principle , the herschel / spire resolution would allow us to reach very high multipoles ( up to @xmath194 ) , the poisson fluctuations are expected to dominate for @xmath195 , i.e. over the multipole range where 1-halo contributions ( i.e. the clustering of sources within a single dark matter halo ) come out , even for surveys reaching the confusion limits . on the whole , we do not expect that herschel / spire surveys will add much to clustering power spectrum determinations provided by planck / hfi , except for the herschel - only @xmath83 m channel .",
    "they will however provide independent estimates .    the great advantage of herschel / spire over planck / hfi resides in its capability of detecting large enough source samples to allow a direct determination of the angular correlation function @xmath129 , at least at @xmath83 m and at @xmath58 m ( fig .  [ wthdndz ] ) .",
    "in particular , a @xmath83 m survey of @xmath196 reaching a flux limit of 25 mjy effectively probes all the three clustering regimes mentioned in  [ sec : form ] .",
    "as illustrated by fig.[wshades ] , measurements of the @xmath129 are also useful to discriminate between galaxy formation models ( van kampen et al .",
    "2005 ; percival et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the error bars are expected to be rather large .",
    "surveys of different depths probe different redshift intervals .    at 350 and @xmath61 m , herschel / spire surveys covering @xmath165 are necessary to extend the counts up to flux density levels sampled by planck , which , at these wavelengths , is confusion limited at @xmath197jy . a survey of a similar area , to a @xmath3 detection limit @xmath198mjy , would also provide sufficient samples of @xmath199 late - type / starburst galaxies to estimate their local luminosity functions .    at @xmath61 m",
    ", such a very large area , shallow survey will also be ideal to select @xmath63 strongly lensed high-@xmath19 dusty galaxies with an essentially 100% efficiency .",
    "as discussed in  3 , the other source populations can be easily distinguished using only available photometric data .",
    "the simultaneous spire surveys at shorter wavelengths with a similar detection limit will detect larger numbers of strongly lensed sources ( e.g. we expect @xmath84 strongly lensed galaxies at @xmath58 m ) , but singling them out will be a less easy and efficient process , although at @xmath58 m the ratio of lensed to unlensed proto - spheroidal galaxies is estimated to be still high ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the redshift distributions of lensed sources is increasingly shifted to higher redshifts with increasing survey wavelength .    we have also estimated that the sassy survey will detect @xmath201 strongly lensed sources , substantially brighter ( in terms of bolometric luminosity ) and with more extreme amplifications than those detected by herschel / spire surveys with a flux limit of @xmath202mjy . these sources will be retrievable with an essentially @xmath203 efficiency , as in the case of the latter surveys .    on the other hand , in spite of its very large area , the sassy survey will probably not detect enough proto - spheroidal galaxies to obtain an estimate of their @xmath129 .",
    "the scuba-2 wide - area extragalactic survey will be much better suited for this purpose and may indeed yield more accurate information on all three clustering regimes than the other surveys discussed here .",
    "it will also detect hundreds of strongly lensed proto - spheroids ; these however will be outnumbered by a factor @xmath204 by unlensed proto - spheroids , so that singling them out will require a toilsome effort .    the experience made in different contexts ( e.g. analyses of spitzer low - frequency data  frayer et al .",
    "2006a , b  or of wmap data  lopez - caniego et al .",
    "2007 ) has demonstrated that source detection algorithms , when applied to low - resolution maps , easily miss real sources or attribute to them wrong positions or misinterpret fluctuations of galactic foregrounds or confusion noise in overdense regions as real sources .",
    "this implies that the subtraction of sources above the nominal detection limit leaves substantial residuals , that , in the case of cmb experiments , add to the contamination of cmb maps .",
    "the situation improves substantially if we can take advantage of the prior knowledge of source positions .",
    "this means that the sassy and a very large area herschel survey is extremely beneficial for detection and photometry of planck sources .    for the purpose of cleaning planck cmb maps from point source contamination ,",
    "it should be noted that , as illustrated by the @xmath0 m panels of fig .",
    "[ powersphfi ] , point sources are important on small angular scales ( large @xmath151 ) .",
    "thus , although the sassy survey will be an exceedingly important resource , a very large area herschel / spire survey will bring in key additional information .",
    "in fact , thanks to the steep rise of dust emission spectra with increasing frequency , a @xmath83 m survey to a flux limit of 100 mjy is deep enough to observationally characterize both poisson and clustering fluctuations due to all the main populations of dusty galaxies , providing key input information for techniques , like the widely used maximum entropy method , that need knowledge of the power spectra of the various components to allow an accurate subtraction of their contribution from cmb maps .",
    "the considered surveys will also provide the first complete , sub - mm selected samples of rare objects , such as blazars . owing to their much flatter counts ( compared to those of dusty galaxies ) ,",
    "blazars are prominent in shallow surveys , while they are swamped by dusty galaxies at faint flux levels .",
    "we thus expect that the richest blazar sample ( @xmath205 objects ) will come from the scuba-2 sassy survey .",
    "the planck @xmath0 m survey should detect @xmath206 blazars at @xmath59 , while the number of detections is expected to rapidly decrease in shorter wavelength channels , as a consequence of the rapidly increasing detection limit .",
    "although herschel / spire surveys of @xmath10 to a flux limit of @xmath202mjy may detect only @xmath182 blazars , the multi - wavelength information would be of great value to investigate the currently controversial issue of the `` blazar sequence '' .",
