    "one of the most relevant theoretical challenges of condensed matter theory is the fundamental understanding of glasses and the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the core of this problem is understanding the crossover from the ergodic regime in which the properties of the system have no history dependence , to the mysterious glass transition region , where the measured properties of the system depend on the protocol of preparation and on the duration of the actual measurements @xcite .",
    "this is so because @xcite _ `` so long as the system does not recover the equilibrium state , it is subject to continuing evolution called relaxation at all stages of whatever measurement is being performed .",
    "this is an important region to understand but also one where difficulties are considerable , at both the experimental and theoretical levels''_. central to this problem is the possibility to distinguish in practice between an ordinary process of equilibration ( in which the system reaches the stationary conditions of full thermodynamic equilibrium within a finite equilibration time ) and the endless non - equilibrium aging process characteristic of glassy materials .",
    "mode coupling theory ( mct ) has provided @xcite a detailed microscopic picture of the transition from ergodic to dynamically arrested states ( identified with the glass ) , with many predicted features of the initial slowdown having found beautiful experimental verification . however , the divergence of the @xmath0-relaxation time @xmath1 predicted at a critical ( `` mct '' ) temperature @xmath2 is never observed in practice .",
    "this has led to the conclusion that this singular transition is avoided due to the existence of activated processes not included in the idealized theory .",
    "while this conclusion has enjoyed immediate and immense acceptance @xcite , in reality the most serious limitation of mct is its inability to describe irreversible non - stationary processes , since mct is in fact a theory of the dynamics of liquids in their thermodynamic equilibrium states . in order to relax this fundamental limitation , in 2000",
    "latz @xcite proposed a formal extension of mct to situations far away from equilibrium which , however , has not yet found a specific quantitative application .",
    "the limitation above is shared by the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of dynamic arrest developed by our group @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts , in a manner completely analogous to mct , the existence of dynamically arrested states .",
    "in contrast to mct , however , the scgle theory has recently been extended to describe the irreversible non - equilibrium evolution of glass - forming liquids @xcite , thus resulting in the _ `` non - equilibrium self - consistent generalized langevin equation '' _ ( ne - scgle ) theory .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to show that this extended theory does provide a conceptually simple picture of the crossover from ergodic equilibration to non - equilibrium aging , offering a perspective of the glass transition in which the `` waiting''-time @xmath3 becomes a relevant active variable and in which indeed the measured properties of the system may depend on the protocol of preparation and on the duration of the actual measurements . to assess the quantitative accuracy of this theory we compare the predicted scenario with the results of a well - defined simulation experiment on the spontaneous isochoric equilibration of hard - sphere glass - forming liquids .",
    "let us start by mentioning that the fundamental basis of the ne - scgle theory is the local stationarity assumption @xcite .",
    "this refers to the postulate that an arbitrary non - equilibrium slow relaxation process may be described as a globally non - stationary , but locally stationary , stochastic process .",
    "this postulate allows the proposal of a general non - equilibrium extension @xcite of onsager s fundamental laws of linear irreversible thermodynamics and the corresponding stochastic theory of thermal fluctuations , as stated by onsager @xcite and by onsager and machlup @xcite , respectively , with an adequate adaptation @xcite to allow for the description of memory effects .",
    "the identification of the abstract state variables involved in this general description , with the local number density @xmath4 of a liquid , results in the time evolution equations for the mean value @xmath5 and for the covariance @xmath6 of the fluctuations @xmath7 .",
    "these two equations turn out to be coupled , through a local mobility function @xmath8 ( essentially a non - stationary and state - dependent onsager s kinetic coefficient ) with the two - point ( van hove ) correlation function @xmath9 .",
    "a set of well - defined approximations on the memory function of @xmath10 , detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , results in the referred ne - scgle theory .",
    "these equations are in principle quite general , and contain well known theories as particular limits , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as one can imagine , the number and variety of phenomena that could be studied with this theory may be enormous , and to start its systematic application let us focus on a specific ( but still generic ) class of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "thus , let us consider a system subjected to a programmed cooling while _ constrained _ to remain spatially _ homogeneous _ at a fixed number density @xmath11 . under these conditions , rather than solving the time - evolution equation for @xmath12 , we have that @xmath13 now becomes a control parameter . as a result",
    ", we only have to solve the time - evolution equation for the covariance @xmath14 .",
    "let us , in addition , restrict ourselves to the simplest cooling protocol , namely , the instantaneous temperature quench at @xmath15 from an arbitrary initial temperature @xmath16 to a final value @xmath17 .",
    "for these conditions , the equation for the covariance @xmath18 can be written , for @xmath19 and in terms of its fourier transform ( ft ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the irreversibly - evolving static structure factor , as @xcite @xmath22 .",

    "the parameter @xmath0 has been empirically determined in the process of calibration of the equilibrium scgle theory , so that the full non - equilibrium equations above do not involve any adjustable parameter . in the application to equilibration and aging of hard - sphere liquids",
    "described below , @xmath0 had been determined to be @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "let us now describe the main features of the scenario that emerges from the simultaneous solution of the ne - scgle equations ( [ relsigmadif2pp])([dzdtquench ] ) .",
    "the first relevant general feature of this system of equations is its very mathematical structure , which assigns a central role to the non - stationary static structure factor @xmath21 .",
    "thus , it is not difficult to see that the kinetics of the dynamic properties ( i.e. , their dependence on the evolution time @xmath3 ) is slaved to the structural relaxation kinetics described by @xmath21 .",
    "notice , for example , that if @xmath21 reaches its equilibrium value @xmath48 within a finite equilibration time @xmath49 , then all the dynamic properties will also reach their equilibrium value within the same equilibration time .",
    "the next relevant feature is that according to the right side of eq .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp ] ) , there can be two fundamentally different kinds of stationary solutions .",
    "the first corresponds to the condition in which stationarity is attained because the factor @xmath50 $ ] on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp ] ) vanishes , i.e. , because @xmath21 is able to reach its thermodynamic equilibrium value @xmath51 while the mobility @xmath29 attains a _ finite _ positive long - time limit @xmath52 .",
    "these solutions correspond , of course , to the ordinary thermodynamic equilibrium states in which , according to ecs .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp])([dzdtquench ] ) , @xmath21 approaches @xmath53 exponentially fast , @xmath54\\propto \\exp[-",
    "t / t^{eq}]$ ] , with the _ equilibration _ time @xmath55 estimated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the _ equilibrium _ long - time self - diffusion coefficient at the final state point @xmath28 .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , except that the _ equilibrium _ scgle theory predicts that @xmath58 will vanish when the state point @xmath28 approaches the ergodic  non - ergodic transition line , so that already in the ergodic neighborhood of this boundary one should experience enormous difficulties in equilibrating the system within practical experimental times .    the second class of stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp ] ) emerges from the possibility that the long - time asymptotic limit of the kinetic factor @xmath29 vanishes , so that @xmath59 vanishes at long times without requiring the equilibrium condition @xmath50=0 $ ] to be fulfilled .",
    "in fact , under these conditions @xmath29 is predicted to decay to zero as @xmath60 @xcite and that @xmath21 will now approach a distinct non - equilibrium stationary limit , denoted by @xmath61 , which is definitely different from the expected equilibrium value @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the difference @xmath63 $ ] is predicted to decay to zero in an extremely slow fashion , namely , as @xmath64 @xcite",
    ". this second class of stationary solutions represents a second , physically distinct and fundamentally different , class of stationary states of matter .",
    "contrary to the ordinary equilibrium states , whose properties are determined solely by the fundamental condition of maximum entropy , the properties of these stationary but intrinsically non - equilibrium states , such as @xmath61 , are strongly dependent on the preparation protocol ( in our example , on @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the extremely slow approach to its asymptotic limit , no matter how long we wait , any finite - time measurement will only record the non - stationary , @xmath3-dependent value of the measured properties ( @xmath21 , @xmath41 , @xmath43 , etc . ) .",
    "although the ne - scgle system of equations ( [ relsigmadif2pp])([dzdtquench ] ) is highly non - linear , changing variable from @xmath3 to @xmath65 re - writes eq .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp ] ) as a linear relaxation equation for @xmath66 , @xmath67 = -\\alpha ( k ) \\left[s^*(k;u ) -s^{eq}_f(k)\\right ] , \\label{relsigmadif2pp2}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp ] ) can thus be written as @xmath69 , with @xmath70e^{-\\alpha ( k)u}. \\label{solsdktexp}\\ ] ] this means that the non - linearity is actually encapsulated in the time - dependence of @xmath71 , in full consistency with the notion of internal ( or `` material '' ) clock , involved in the phenomenological model of aging of tool and narayanaswamy @xcite .",
    "this model , recently summarized , for example , by hecksher et al .",
    "@xcite and by richert @xcite , is commonly used in industry for predicting aging effects @xcite and to fit a large number of experimental data .",
    "we thus conclude that the ne - scgle theory captures this intriguing and relevant universality and casts it in a more fundamental and precise first - principles physical context .    with the intention to start building confidence on the quantitative accuracy of this conceptual picture , let us begin with a systematic direct comparison of these theoretical predictions with available simulation results .",
    "here we shall only refer to the specific simulation experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a hard - sphere liquid is driven to a non - equilibrium state by means of an effective sudden compression protocol to a final density @xmath11 corresponding to the desired volume fraction @xmath72 .",
    "this protocol generates an ensemble of configurations representative of such non - equilibrium state , which define the starting condition of the equilibration ( or aging ) process .",
    "the corresponding theoretical treatment , recently worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , approximates the static structure factor @xmath73 of this initial non - equilibrium state , by an _ equilibrium _",
    "static structure factor @xmath74 of a mono - component fluid of soft spheres of diameter @xmath75 at a certain finite temperature @xmath16 .",
    "this assumes that the structural relaxation scenario that follows the sudden compression of the hard - sphere liquid to a final volume fraction @xmath76 is similar to the structural relaxation scenario that follows the sudden quench of a soft - sphere liquid at the same fixed volume fraction @xmath76 from a finite ( rather arbitrary ) temperature @xmath16 to the final temperature @xmath77 . in both cases the system",
    "is expected to relax to the same final equilibrium state , whose static structure factor @xmath53 is that of the hard sphere liquid , @xmath78 .    in practice , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the weeks - chandler - andersen soft - sphere fluid whose particles interact through a pair potential that vanishes for @xmath79 but for @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 $ ] . here",
    "we also approximate the initial static structure factor by @xmath82 , and determine @xmath83 using the extension of the py / vw approximation explained in refs .",
    "we arbitrarily set @xmath16 as @xmath84 $ ] ( notice that in ref @xcite the value @xmath85 $ ] was employed ) . in order to connect the resulting predictions of the ne - scgle theory , developed in principle for brownian systems , with the ( newtonian ) molecular dynamics simulation data of ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the prescription explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , which identifies the short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath31 needed in eqs .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp])([dzdtquench ] ) with the kinetic - theory expression @xmath86 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] we illustrate the comparison of the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ relsigmadif2pp])([dzdtquench ] ) within this set of assumptions and approximations , with the corresponding simulation data .",
    "we plot @xmath87 as a function of the correlation time @xmath34 for a sequence of values of the waiting time @xmath3 .",
    "these results describe the process of equilibration of the hs liquid at @xmath88 .",
    "although there are obvious deviations , some of them expected from the short - time dynamic differences between newtonian and brownian systems , there is full qualitative consistency between the general trends exhibited by the simulation data and by the theoretical results . from this sequence of snapshots of @xmath87",
    "we extract the @xmath0-relaxation time @xmath89 , defined by @xmath90 .",
    "the resulting @xmath3-evolution of @xmath89 for @xmath91 and @xmath88 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] , along with similar results corresponding to other values of @xmath76 .",
    "this comparison between the simulated and predicted results illustrates the extent of the consistency between the main qualitative features of the predicted and the simulated scenarios .",
    "for example , in both cases we see that when the quench is done to a point in the ergodic domain ( i.e. , to a volume fraction smaller than 0.582 ) , the system will equilibrate within a @xmath76-dependent equilibration time @xmath92 which , however , strongly increases with @xmath76 , in a very similar manner as the equilibrium value @xmath93 of the @xmath0-relaxation time .",
    "in fact , as can be gathered from the solid circles in fig . [ fig:1b ] , our theory predicts that @xmath94^\\eta$ ] , with @xmath95 ( rather than @xmath96 , as determined in the simulations @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-relaxation time @xmath97 can also be plotted as a function of @xmath76 for a sequence of fixed waiting times . and",
    "the resulting scenarios are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1c ] .",
    "this comparison illustrates that both , theory and simulations , coincide in that the plot of @xmath98 as a function of @xmath76 for a given fixed waiting time exhibits two regimes corresponding to samples that have fully equilibrated within this waiting time @xmath99 , and to samples for which equilibration is not yet complete @xmath100 .",
    "the crossover volume fraction @xmath101 increases with @xmath3 but seems to saturate to the value @xmath102 , as indicated in the inset .",
    "this comparison confirms that , at least within the window of waiting times considered , the dynamic arrest transition may indeed involve the abrupt passage from the ordinary pattern of full equilibration to the ultra - slow scenario predicted to occur under conditions of dynamic arrest .",
    "however , it also shows that the experimental observation of the predicted singularity of @xmath103 will be blurred by the unavoidable finiteness of the time window of any experimental observation . in other words , it is impossible to witness the infinite - time consequences of the theoretically - predicted singular dynamic arrest transition , since any finite - time measurement will only record the non - stationary , @xmath3-dependent value of the measured properties .",
    "these conclusions can , of course , only be tentative , since further work is needed to fully validate the whole predicted scenario .",
    "for example , it is desirable to systematically extend the time window of the simulations , and to improve the corresponding methodologies .",
    "for example , we found that the loss of ergodicity becomes a truly fundamental challenge , since the size of the representative non - equilibrium ensemble needed to get stable statistics in the simulations seems to increase without bound as one gets deeper in the glassy regime .",
    "similarly , some present theoretical limitations must also be overcome , such as introducing size polydispersity in the model .",
    "this is indeed work in progress , but we believe that the discussion above does exhibit an immediate contribution of the _ non - equilibrium _ scgle theory , namely , the conceptual enrichment of the discussion of the glass transition problem by introducing the waiting - time dimension @xmath3 in the description of glassy behavior .",
