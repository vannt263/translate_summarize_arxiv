    "white dwarfs are the most common endpoint of stellar evolution in galaxies and dense stellar systems . during the past decade ,",
    "ongoing optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the eso supernova ia progenitor survey ( spy ) have provided a plethora of new white dwarf binaries suitable to study poorly understood binary evolution phases such as common envelope evolution and type ia supernovae .",
    "binaries consisting of two white dwarfs are furthermore the single most abundant and only guaranteed sources of gravitational wave radiation in the galaxy for the laser interferometer space antenna , lisa ( bender et al .",
    "1998 ) .    despite the high abundance of white dwarf binaries in present - day and",
    "planned astrophysical surveys , the study of their orbital evolution has remained limited to models in which the white dwarfs are treated as point masses , in so far as the calculation of the gravitational potential is concerned .",
    "gravitational wave forms of double white dwarf binaries , for instance , currently only account for orbital frequency changes driven by gravitational radiation . as",
    "a significant fraction of these systems spirals in to periods as short as 5 minutes , tidal effects can , in principle , have a significant impact on the orbital evolution and thus the gravitational wave frequency evolution .",
    "the impact depends strongly on the strength and the nature of the tidal energy dissipation mechanism , which , for white dwarfs , remains uncertain .",
    "racine , phinney , & arras ( 2007 ) recently also proposed a non - dissipative tidal evolution mechanism in which angular momentum exchange between the star and the orbit is driven by resonant excitation of rossby modes .",
    "however , as commented by the authors , non - linear effects likely limit the lifetime of the resonance and thus the tidal evolution mechanism .",
    "campbell ( 1984 ) studied dissipative tides in white dwarf binaries assuming the orbital frequency of the binary to be much smaller than the frequencies of the white dwarf s free modes of oscillation and limiting his study to circular binaries .",
    "the author considered energy dissipation through perturbations of the radiative energy flux , and used a perturbation technique to calculate the tidal velocity field in a non - rotating white dwarf .",
    "campbell found that , in circular binaries , the synchronization time scale of a white dwarf can be comparable to the white dwarf s lifetime , provided that the initial degree of asynchronism is sufficiently large .",
    "however , in his estimate for the tidal synchronization time scale , he used a rather high white dwarf luminosity of @xmath3 , which decreases the time scale by several orders of magnitude compared to the tidal synchronization time scale of a more conventional @xmath4 white dwarf ( see his eq .",
    "other authors studying the impact of tidal effects on the evolution of white dwarf binaries either assumed tidal dissipation to be strong enough to maintain synchronism at all times ( webbink & iben 1987 ; mochkovitch & livio 1989 ; iben , tutukov , & fedorova 1998 ) or parameterized tidal dissipation by means of an ad - hoc tidal synchronization time scale ( marsh , nelemans , & steeghs 2004 ; gokhale , peng , & frank 2007 ) .",
    "in contrast , tidal evolution theories for binaries with non - degenerate component stars are well developed and able to pass stringent observational tests such as measured orbital decay rates of high - mass x - ray binaries ( belczynski et al . 2008 ) and",
    "circularization cut - off periods in young open cluster binaries ( witte & savonije 2002 , zahn 2008 ) .",
    "however , for the latter test , some debate still exists on the agreement between theory and observations ( mathieu , meibom , & dolan 2004 ; meibom & mathieu 2005 ) . according to our current understanding ,",
    "non - degenerate stars with convective envelopes dissipate tidal energy primarily through convective damping of quasi - static tides , while non - degenerate stars with radiative envelopes dissipate tidal energy primarily through radiative damping of dynamic tides ( zahn 1975 , 1977 ) .",
    "both dissipation mechanisms may be significantly enhanced by resonances between tidally forced oscillations and free oscillation modes of the component stars , especially in binaries with eccentric orbits ( witte & savonije 1999 , 2001 , 2002 ) .    our aim in this paper is to initiate a systematic investigation of tidal dissipation mechanisms operating in white dwarfs by building on the success of tidal evolution for non - degenerate stars . here",
    "we explore the effectiveness of convective damping of quasi - static tides as a tidal energy dissipation mechanism in white dwarf binaries . in  2 and  3",
    ", we outline the basic assumptions and introduce the system of differential equations governing tidally forced oscillations in close binaries . in  4 , we use a perturbation method to derive approximate solutions to the system of differential equations appropriate for quasi - static tides . in  5 and  6 , we present the equations governing the secular evolution of the orbital elements and white dwarf rotation rates . in  7",
    ", we calculate the quasi - static tidal distortion and orbital evolution time scales for a @xmath0 he white dwarf model , and compare the orbital evolution time scales with those due to gravitational radiation .",

    "the second star , hereafter referred to as the companion , has mass @xmath12 and is considered to be a point mass .",
    "the rotational angular velocity @xmath13 of star  1 is assumed to be small enough for the coriolis force and the centrifugal force to be negligible , so that the tides raised by the companion can be treated as forced perturbations of a non - rotating , spherically symmetric , equilibrium star .",

    "<S> we present a formalism to study tidal interactions in white dwarf binaries in the limiting case of quasi - static tides , in which the tidal forcing frequencies are small compared to the inverse of the white dwarf s dynamical time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is valid for arbitrary orbital eccentricities and therefore applicable to white dwarf binaries in the galactic disk as well as globular clusters . in the quasi - static limit </S>",
    "<S> , the total perturbation of the gravitational potential shows a phase shift with respect to the position of the companion , the magnitude of which is determined primarily by the efficiency of energy dissipation through convective damping . </S>",
    "<S> we determine rates of secular evolution of the orbital elements and white dwarf rotational angular velocity for a @xmath0 helium white dwarf in binaries with orbital frequencies in the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) gravitational wave frequency band and companion masses ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting tidal evolution time scales for the orbital semi - major axis are longer than a hubble time , so that convective damping of quasi - static tides need not be considered in the construction of gravitational wave templates of white dwarf binaries in the lisa band . </S>",
    "<S> spin - up of the white dwarf , on the other hand , can occur on time scales of less than 10myr , provided that the white dwarf is initially rotating with a frequency much smaller than the orbital frequency . for semi - detached white dwarf binaries </S>",
    "<S> spin - up can occur on time scales of less than 1myr . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the time scales remain longer than the orbital inspiral time scales due to gravitational radiation , so that the degree of asynchronism in these binaries increases . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , tidal forcing eventually occurs at forcing frequencies beyond the quasi - static tide approximation . </S>",
    "<S> for the shortest period binaries , energy dissipation is therefore expected to take place through dynamic tides and resonantly excited @xmath2-modes . </S>"
