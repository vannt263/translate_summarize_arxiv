    "the spiral arm observed in the nir is not detected in our mir images .",

    "the widths of both arcs are broader than the beam size .    by integrating the signals within the range of @xmath36 , we derived the fluxes of the eastern and western regions at 18.8 and 24.5  @xmath0 and the flux ratio of @xmath37 as a color indicator of the dust emission ( table  [ derived_parameters ] ) .",
    "we calculated the predicted color profiles of the mir emitting dust around hd  142527 for the emissivities of various sized astronomical silicate @xcite and compared them with the observed colors ( fig .",

    "@xcite also argue that the size of grains responsible for the scattering is @xmath40 because the color of scattered light from dust around hd  142527 is similar to the color of the star , being in agreement with ours .",
    "the dust grains around hd  142527 are larger than the grains in the interstellar medium , suggesting that the dust grains in the disk have already grown to some extent due to coagulation of smaller dust particles .",
    "we also derived the temperature and optical depth of the mir emitting dust within each region from the fluxes of 18.8  @xmath0 and 24.5  @xmath0 , assuming a single size distribution of 2.5  @xmath0-sized silicate @xcite .",
    "we derived the temperatures as @xmath41  k and @xmath42  k and the optical depths of the mir emitting dust as @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the eastern and western regions , respectively .",
    "while the temperatures of the eastern and western regions are in agreement with each other within the errors , the optical depth of the eastern region is 3 times larger than that of the western region .",
    "the asymmetry in the brightness of the extended emission originates from the difference of the optical depth between the eastern and western side .    while the above results are derived on the assumption of @xmath38 , @xcite proposed @xmath45 . taking this luminosity",
    ", then we obtain 1.6  @xmath0 as a typical size of grains .",
    "the effect of the radiation from the inner disk has also been examined by assuming that the inner disk emits as a blackbody of @xmath46  k and @xmath47 , which is estimated from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the estimated dust size becomes 2  @xmath0 .",
    "thus we conclude that the presence of @xmath0-sized grains in the disk is secure .",
    "as a global distribution of the material in the disk around hd  142527 , we suggest that there are a large amount of cold materials in the outer region of @xmath48au ( outer disk ) , while there are quite a few materials present in the inner region .",
    "since we can see a drop of radiation at @xmath2 in the images , a gap in the material density must exist .",
    "the existence of the material gap is compatible with the mir flux gap seen in the sed @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of `` a nearby very red source '' whose temperature is @xmath49  k as the origin of the large far - infrared excess seen in the sed .",
    "however , our observations demonstrate that the large far - infrared excess is attributed to the outer disk associated with the star , not to `` a nearby very red source '' .",
    "as we mentioned in  [ result ] , the asymmetric brightness of the outer disk of hd  142527 can be attributed to the difference in @xmath4 of the mir emitting dust .",
    "nir scattered light observations of hd  142527 by ciao show that the western side of the extended disk is brighter than the eastern side by 2.0 mag @xcite .",
    "850  @xmath0 continuum observations by submillimeter array ( sma ) , which is thought to be optically thin to dust emission and a good tracer of the total amount of dust , show an east - west symmetric structure of the extended disk ( ohashi et al , in prep . ) .",
    "to explain these observations , we propose a model that the dust disk is geometrically thick and inclined as the eastern side is farther to us and the inner rim of the eastern side of the outer disk is exposed to us .",
    "[ rim_model ] shows a schematic view of the model of the hd  142527 system .",
    "since the inner edge and rim are hottest within the outer disk and affect the mir brightness most strongly , the emitting region of the outer disk appears like a narrow ring .",
    "therefore the optical depth we mentioned above does not directly correspond to the vertical depth of the mir emitting layer of the disk , but rather indicates the area size of the mir emitting region within the beam .",
    "if the disk is inclined as the eastern side is farther to us , the eastern inner rim of the outer disk can be seen directly while the western one can not because the cooler materials farther out are obscuring the inner hot dust .",
    "we suggest that the difference of visibility of the inner rim makes the strong asymmetric mir brightness of the outer disk .",
    "the model we are proposing here can also explain that the western side is brighter in the nir scattered light @xcite .",
    "in the scattered light , we observe back scattered light in the eastern side and forward scattered light in the western side . for grains those sizes are similar to or larger than the wavelength in question , the forward scattering is much stronger than the back scattering , resulting in the observed asymmetry in the nir . an axial symmetric disk inclined to the east - west direction",
    "is also consistent with the symmetric structure of the extended disk traced by 850  @xmath0 radiation .",
    "it is not necessary to consider an axial asymmetric material distribution such as a circumbinary disk to account for the observations .",
    "details of the appearance of a protoplanetary disk , including a `` peculiar horseshoe - like feature '' for models with an inclination of 30@xmath50 , were predicted in simulations of @xcite .",
    "a model 12  @xmath0 intensity map in their paper shows a morphology strikingly similar to our images of the outer disk of hd  142527 .",
    "nir interferometric observations of lkh@xmath51  101 show that an asymmetric arc - like radiation component is present in addition to a central compact component @xcite . in the case of lkh@xmath51  101 ,",
    "the asymmetric arc - like structure is thought to be attributed to the hot dust within the inner rim of the inner hole made by dust sublimation .",
    "though the observed spatial scale and wavelength are different , hd  142527 and lkh@xmath51  101 agree on the asymmetric arc - like morphology of thermal emission . in the case of hd  142527 ,",
    "photoevaporation of dust can be ruled out as the cause of the gap because the position of gap is far from the central star . a secondary object ,",
    "if any , may be able to create the gap .",
    "high spatial resolution radio observations will be required in order to discuss the origin of the gap in detail .",
