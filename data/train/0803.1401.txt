    "homogeneous and isotropic solutions of einstein s laws of gravitation do not account for inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the question whether they do _ on average _ is a longstanding issue that is the subject of considerable debate especially in the recent literature ( @xcite , @xcite and follow  up references ; comprehensive lists may be found in the reviews @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "averaging the scalar parts of einstein s equations on space  like hypersurfaces of a foliation of spacetime @xcite it was found that the friedmannian framework is still applicable , however , one must include additional source terms due to the backreaction of inhomogeneities on a homogeneous  isotropic solution .",
    "these terms have geometrical origin and , as has been recently shown , can be represented by a minimally coupled scalar field component , a so  called _ morphon field _",
    "@xcite , if those geometrical terms are interpreted as effective sources in a cosmological model with friedmannian kinematics .",
    "this effective field can , like quintessence , other scalar field models @xcite , e.g. models motivated by higher ",
    "order ricci curvature lagrangians @xcite , @xcite or string  motivated effective actions @xcite , be employed to model dark energy .",
    "while the newtonian and post  newtonian frameworks suppress these effective scalar field degrees of freedom by construction @xcite , @xcite , and so can not lead to an explanation of dark energy , general relativity not only offers a wider range of possible cosmologies , since it is not constrained by the assumption of euclidean or constant curvature geometry and small deviations thereof , but it is also needed to describe an effect that is strictly absent in a newtonian model and in a standard ( quasi  newtonian ) perturbation approach at a fixed background .",
    "this effect is reflected by the coupling of the fluctuations to the averaged model . in other words ,",
    "fluctuations may be small , but measured relative to a non ",
    "friedmannian background , and the evolution of this latter is most clearly expressed in terms of the evolution of effective geometrical properties such as the averaged scalar curvature we are considering in this paper ( see @xcite for detailed explanations ) . speaking in favour of an averaged cosmology , it certainly enjoys the more physical status of incorporating inhomogeneities , and the clearcut fact that the effect of these inhomogeneities can be modelled by a scalar field speaks , by william of ockham s _ razor _ , against introducing a dominating cosmological constant or an extra fundamental scalar field that is known to violate energy conditions in order to explain observational data . from this point of view one",
    "would also conclude that perturbation theory , if formulated at the background of a flrw model with a dominating cosmological constant or an external scalar field source , would also not account for the physics behind the dark energy component .",
    "on the other hand , the flrw cosmology provides a remarkably successful _ fitting model _ to a large number of observational data .",
    "as already mentioned , the price to pay is an unclear physical origin of either a dominating cosmological constant or an extra scalar field source that dominates recently .",
    "given the fact that also a large amount of sources in the form of dark matter has not yet been detected in ( non  gravitational ) experiments , the standard model parametrizes an overwhelming fraction ( 95 percent ) of physical ignorance .",
    "the generally held view , however , is that the flrw cosmology indeed describes the _ physical universe _ on average , which  if true  in turn asks for either a modification of the laws of gravitation , or the postulation of the above  mentioned dark sources of yet unknown origin . moreover",
    ", the widespread use of the wording ` fitting model ' is just name  dropping unless we devise a way to explicitly construct a smooth metric out of the inhomogeneous distributions of matter and curvature @xcite . in this",
    " more refined  sense the flrw cosmology is not a fitting model , rather _ it furnishes a conjecture on integral properties of the physical universe _ that , as we believe , has to be first verified or falsified before more exotic vehicles of explanation are invoked",
    ".    both , the flrw cosmology and a backreaction  driven averaged cosmology are candidates for the description of these integral properties , and in this paper we shall estimate these properties from regionally ( up to , say , 100 mpc ) observable quantities . for the flrw cosmology in the form of the _ concordance model _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the physical model is described by on average vanishing scalar curvature , while for a backreaction ",
    "driven cosmology , if we expect that dark energy can be fully routed back to inhomogeneities , the issue appears open .",
    "however , the consequences of a backreaction  driven model have been qualitatively , and to the extent we need also quantitatively , exploited in a number of recent papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for example , since a quantitative estimation of kinematical backreaction depends on specifying an evolution model for the inhomogeneities , the analysis of exact solutions like the lematre  tolman  bondi solution ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the reference lists in @xcite and @xcite ) , or scaling laws that satisfy the averaged equations @xcite have been investigated",
    ". _ consistency _ of an explanation of dark energy with the framework of the averaged equations has been demonstrated for both globally homogeneous cosmologies @xcite ( an assumption that we also adopt in the present paper ) and , alternatively , globally inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "although a quantitative evaluation of the backreaction effect in a generic inhomogeneous model is still to come , we already know a few features of a ` working ' model , which are enough for our considerations",
    ".    we do not aim at investigating a ` fitting model ' ( see figure 1 ) for the present  day universe in the strict sense mentioned above ; this is the subject of ongoing work .",
    "we only remark here that any model for the evolution of the averaged variables can be subjected to a smoothing procedure in order to find the corresponding smooth , i.e. constant  curvature fitting model that we may call a _",
    "flrw template_. we would then consider a hypersurface at a given instant of time ; we can not expect that the time  evolved inhomogeneous model can be mapped to a constant  curvature model .",
    "the above two candidates would provide different starting points , i.e. the initial data of a smoothing procedure for a given hypersurface are different .",
    "it was recently argued @xcite that the averaged universe model ( now both kinematically and geometrically averaged ) could be represented by an effective flrw metric with a time  scaling factor that differs from the usual global scale factor of a homogeneous  isotropic model and which is determined by the kinematically averaged einstein equations .",
    "this ansatz for an effective metric assumes that smoothing ( i.e. spatial rescaling ) the actual matter and curvature inhomogeneities does not leave traces in the smoothed  out flrw template metric _",
    "at all times_. in a forthcoming paper we are going to analyze this assumption in detail employing previous results on an explicit smoothing algorithm @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we are entitled to investigate integral properties of physical variables on a given hypersurface _ without _ entering the different question of whether this hypersurface ( if actively deformed ) can be effectively described by a ` best  fit ' constant  curvature geometry",
    ".    a rough guide that helps to understand the motivation of the present work is the following . for small inhomogeneities in the matter and curvature distributions , an approximate description of the cosmic evolution _ on average _ by a homogeneous solution of einstein s laws of gravitation may be fine , but for the late universe featuring strong inhomogeneities , the validity of this approximation is not evident .",
    "we are going to address and justify this remark in the present work _ on the assumptions _ that ( i ) a homogeneous model satisfactorily describes the early stages of the matter  dominated epoch and ( ii ) there exists a scale of homogeneity .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section  [ section : phenomenology ]",
    "we look at the present  day universe and device a three  scale model for it , where we hope that both readers , those who advocate the standard picture of the concordance model and those who advocate a backreaction  driven cosmology , agree .",
    "then , in section  [ section : multiscaling ] , we implement the details of this multi  scale picture and reduce the determining sources to those that are in principle measurable on regional ( i.e. up to 100 mpc ) scales .",
    "detailed estimates of the kinematical backreaction and averaged scalar curvature follow in section  [ section : q ] , where we also provide simplified estimates in the form of robust bounds by , e.g. , restricting the measurement of fluctuations to a comoving frame . in section  [ section : conclusions ] we confront this latter result with the different assumptions on the actual averaged scalar curvature of the present  day universe .",
    "observing the universe at low redshift returns the impression of large volumes that are almost devoid of any matter ; a network of large  scale structure surrounds these _ voids _ that seem to be hierarchically nested and their sizes , depending on their definition , range from regional voids with less than 10 percent galaxy number content of the order of ten megaparsecs @xcite , @xcite , to relatively thinned  out regions of larger number density that , if smoothed , would span considerable volume fractions of currently available large  scale structure surveys .",
    "while the overall volume of the observable universe seems to be dominated by underdense regions ( the particular value of the volume  fraction of underdense regions being dependent on the threshold of this underdensity ) , the small fraction of the volume hosting overdensities ( groups , clusters and superclusters of galaxies ) is itself sparsely populated by luminous matter and , this latter , appears as a highly nonlinear ` spiky ' distribution .",
    "the phenomenological impression that matter apparently occupies a tiny fraction of space _ at all length scales _ could be questioned by saying that _ dark matter _ might be more smoothly distributed .",
    "also , clusters contain a large amount of intergalactic gas , there are non  shining baryons , etc .",
    ", so that the notion of an ` underdense region ' has to be treated with care .",
    "however , simulations of _ cold dark matter _ , assumed to rule the formation of large  scale structure , also demonstrate that voids dominate the present  day distribution . again depending on the particular definition of a void",
    ", their fraction of volume occupation could , to give a rough value , be conservatively quoted as being 60 @xcite percent in standard _ @xmath0cold dark matter _ simulations counting strong underdensities , and is certainly larger for more densly populated but still underdense regions .",
    "thinking in terms of a _ homogeneous model _ of the universe ( not necessarily a homogeneous _ solution _ ) , i.e. a distribution of matter that on average does not depend on scale beyond a certain large scale ( the scale of homogeneity ) , one would paint the picture of a redistribution of matter due to nonlinear gravitational instability . in a newtonian simulation ( where an eventually constant curvature of a flrw spacetime is factored out on a periodic scale )",
    "this would happen in such a way that , due to the preservation of the overall material mass , an _ equipartition _ of overdense small  volume regions and underdense large  volume regions with respect to the mass content results , so that a sensible spatial average of the matter distribution must comply with the original value of the homogeneous density .",
    "in other words , the assumption that a volume  averaged distribution of matter would be compatible with a homogeneous model of the same average density seems to be a robust assumption , especially if inhomogeneities are dynamically generated out of an almost homogeneous distribution . this picture is true in newtonian simulations , but for a subtle reason : although the time  evolution of the averaged density as a result of _ non  commutativity _ of evolution ( time  scaling ) and spatial averaging gives rise to kinematical backreaction , the periodic architecture and the euclidean geometry of a newtonian cosmology imply that these additional terms have to vanish ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of all these issues and proofs ) . in a general  relativistic framework this picture is in general false , even at one instant of time : the reason is that a riemannian volume average incorporates the volume measure that is different for negatively and positively curved domains of averaging , and curvature does not obey an equipartition law ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "note also that a volume averaging on a riemannian 3surface could , even on the largest scale , introduce a _ volume effect _ in the comparison of the volume of a constant  curvature space and the actual volume of an inhomogeneous hypersurface ( see @xcite and @xcite for the definition and discussion of the _ volume effect _ ; see also hellaby s volume  matching example @xcite ) .",
    "the standard model ( but also the recent suggestion by @xcite ) implies that there is no such effect on large scales .",
    "it is illustrative to think of 2surfaces , where curvature inhomogeneities always add up in the calculation of the total surface , so that there certainly is a large _ 2volume effect _ due to surface roughening , but for three  dimensional manifolds , negative and positive curvature contribute with opposite signs , and so the _",
    "3volume effect _ can not easily be quantified .",
    "given the above remarks , one is no longer tempted to draw a picture of equipartition for the intrinsic curvature distribution .",
    "we shall , in this paper , not discuss the time  evolution of the scalar curvature ( see @xcite and @xcite for detailed illustrations and discussions ) , large ",
    "time asymptotics @xcite , the role of a constant  curvature parameter in the fit to observations @xcite , or curvature models @xcite ( that are all related subjects of interest ) , but instead contemplate on the distribution of curvature at one given instant of time . here",
    ", we demonstrate that the picture we would wish to establish in the concordance model , namely that the scalar curvature would average out on some large scale of homogeneity , is naive in a number of ways , and we shall implement the geometrical aspects of such a picture in section  [ section : multiscaling ] .",
    "obviously , this issue can not be addressed with newtonian simulations ; the curvature degree of freedom is simply absent .",
    "we know that in riemannian geometry negatively curved regions have a volume that is larger than the corresponding volume in a euclidean space section , and positively curved regions have a smaller volume , thus enhancing the actual volume fraction of underdense regions .    we are now going to develop a multi  scale picture of the present  day universe that is useful in the context of quantitative estimates , and that also helps to quantify multi ",
    "scale dynamical models , e.g. the one proposed by wiltshire and his collaborators @xcite , but it relates as well to any model that involves considerations of structures on different spatial scales .",
    "we are going to introduce three spatial scales .",
    "first , a _ scale of homogeneity _ @xmath1 that could be identified with the size of a compact universe model , but need at least be larger than the largest observed typical structures .",
    "second , a scale @xmath2 that is as large as a typical void ( within a range of values that depends on our definition of a devoid region ) , and third , a scale @xmath3 that is large enough to host typical bound large ",
    "scale objects such as a rich cluster of galaxies . in observational cosmology",
    "we strictly have @xmath4 for the first we may also think of a length of the order of the hubble  scale .",
    "the lower bound on this scale not only depends on the statistical measure with respect to which one considers the matter and curvature distributions as being _ homogeneous _ , but also on the concept of _ homogeneity _ that we have in mind . we here imply that averages _ of any variable _ beyond this scale will in practice no longer depend on scale , while generically , this may not happen at all .",
    "we do not claim here that this is indeed true , but we adopt this point of view in order to have a more transparent way of comparison with the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the assumption of existence of a scale of homogeneity may be a strong hypothesis ; it is our choice of restricting the generality of the problem .",
    ", the scale of a typical void @xmath5 , and the scale @xmath6 hosting typical bound large  scale objects , _ e.g. _ a rich cluster of galaxies . ]",
    "according to what has been said above , we are entitled to assign different properties to the different scales , and we shall also sometimes idealize these properties in order to construct a simple but flexible model that reflects the phenomenology described above in terms of a small set of parameters .",
    "we start with an overview of the basic ingredients of our model and postpone details to section  [ section : multiscaling ] .",
    "we employ the hamiltonian constraint ( see ( [ constraints ] ) below ) , spatially averaged on a given domain @xmath7 ( scale @xmath1 ) that covers a union of underdense regions @xmath8 ( scale @xmath2 ) and occupied overdense regions @xmath9 ( scale @xmath3 ) .",
    "we write the hamiltonian constraint averaged over the first scale ( for details see below and , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath10 with the total restmass @xmath11 .",
    "the averaged spatial scalar curvature is denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 abbreviates the averaged rate of expansion @xmath14 in terms of a _ volume hubble rate _ , and the _ kinematical backreaction term _ @xmath15 encodes inhomogeneities in the extrinsic curvature distribution ( or the kinematical variables ) ; it is detailed in section  [ section : multiscaling ] ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .    . ]    now , let us consider for illustrative purposes an idealization on the two other scales ( in our concrete calculations later we shall indicate clearly when we make use of it ) : we require the volume hubble expansion to be subdominant in matter  dominated regions and , on the other hand , the averaged density to be subdominant in devoid regions . in the first case , an expansion or contraction would contribute negatively to the averaged scalar curvature and so would , e.g. , enhance a negative averaged curvature ; in the second case , the presence of a low averaged density would contribute positively . we can therefore reasonably expect that , whether we use a strong idealization ( see below ) or a weaker distinction between over and underdense regions , the overall argument based on the existence of such a partitioning enjoys some robustness .",
    "we shall also be able to condense our assumption on the partition between over and underdense regions by introducing a parameter for the occupied volume fraction , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the total volume of the union of occupied regions @xmath18 ; its value may be chosen more conservatively to weaken an eventually unrealistic idealization . at any rate , we shall keep our calculations as general as possible before we eventually invoke an idealization for illustrative purposes ; it is only this latter quantity @xmath16 that parametrizes the ( geometrical ) volume  partitioning of the distributions of inhomogeneities .",
    "note that , if we would strictly idealize voids to have @xmath19 and and matter  dominated regions to have @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is some critical scale ( see section  [ section : multiscaling ] for more details on this transitory scale and the controling of this idealization ) , then we would have : @xmath23 and @xmath24 together with @xmath25 this simplified view is useful as a rough guide on the sign of the averaged scalar curvature : consider for example the case where the kinematical backreaction terms in the above equations are quantitatively negligible , and let us put @xmath26 ; we then infer that the averaged scalar curvature must be _ negative _ on scale @xmath2 and _ positive _ on scale @xmath3 , what obviously complies with what we expect . a non  vanishing @xmath27 is employed in the concordance model to compensate the negative curvature .      for our discussion",
    "we introduce a set of adimensional average characteristics that we define for the largest scale : @xmath28 we shall , henceforth , call these characteristics ` parameters ' , but the reader should keep in mind that indexed variables are scale  dependent functionals . expressed through these parameters the averaged hamiltonian constraint",
    "( [ averagehamiltond ] ) on the scale @xmath1 assumes the form : @xmath29 in this set , the averaged scalar curvature parameter and the kinematical backreaction parameter are directly expressed through @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in order to compare this pair of parameters with the ` friedmannian constant  curvature parameter ' that is the only curvature contribution in the standard model , we can alternatively introduce the pair ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath32 being related to the previous parameters by @xmath33 .",
    "for any of the smaller domains we discuss the corresponding adimensional parameters by dividing averages @xmath34 on the domain @xmath35 always by @xmath36 to avoid confusion .",
    "this will also avoid the pathological and useless definition of the cosmological parameters , e.g. on the domains @xmath18 , where they are actually undefined in a strict idealization , since @xmath37 is assumed to vanish .    to give an illustration for the scale  dependence , note",
    "that , in the strictly idealized case , @xmath38 can be traced back to the average density in matter  dominated regions , @xmath39 , and thus , inevitably , the density parameter constructed with an observed @xmath40 on the scale @xmath18 and divided by the global hubble factor can not be extrapolated to the global parameter .",
    "for example , a value today of @xmath41 for this parameter would , for a volume fraction of matter  dominated regions of @xmath42 , result in @xmath43 , i.e. a substantially smaller value that compensates the missing matter in the regions @xmath44 , if they are idealized to be empty .",
    "note in this context that a smaller mass density parameter on the global scale would also imply a smaller value of the necessary amount of backreaction .",
    "this can be seen by considering the _ volume deceleration parameter _ ,",
    "@xmath45 which , for @xmath46 , shows that decreasing the matter density parameter would also decrease the necessary backreaction in order to find , e.g. _ volume acceleration _ ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "let us now discuss one of the motivations of the present work related to the dark energy debate . to this end",
    ", we have to explain why a substantial negative averaged scalar curvature is needed , so that dark energy could be partly or completely routed back to inhomogeneities , i.e. @xmath48 in the above equations , and , say , also @xmath49 as soon as we go to numerical estimates , indicating the value of the corresponding parameter _ today_. note that , in the averaged models , we may weaken this constraint , since we can allow for a scale  dependence of this parameter in contrast to the situation in the standard model ; see @xcite and @xcite for related discussions . ] in conformity with the standard model of cosmology .",
    "first , by _ substantial _ we mean a cosmologically large negative curvature , i.e. expressed in terms of the cosmological parameters @xmath50 .",
    "this parameter is exactly equal to @xmath51 , i.e. the averaged curvature is of the order of minus the square of the hubble parameter , if there are no matter and no expansion and shear fluctuations .",
    "this applies to a simplified model of a void @xcite .",
    "second , in order to explain dark energy , the sum of the curvature and backreaction parameters has to add up to mimic a cosmological constant parameter of the order of  @xmath52 in the case of a full compensation of the cosmological constant today , where we have adopted the assumption of the concordance model @xcite of @xmath53 .",
    "a conservative scenario has been quantified in @xcite where it was assumed that the universe at the cosmic microwave background epoch is described by a weakly perturbed flrw model and the amount of early dark energy is negligible .",
    "the resulting scenario that would create enough dark energy features a strong curvature evolution from a negligible value to @xmath54 , while the backreaction parameter must evolve from a negligible value to @xmath55 , i.e. it has to be dominated by expansion fluctuations on the scale @xmath1 today .",
    "this scenario implies that the averaged scalar curvature must be close to the value of our simple void model , while at early times the averaged curvature parameter was compatible with zero . speaking in terms of a _ morphon field _",
    "@xcite , where the scalar curvature is associated with the potential of a scalar field , this scenario corresponds to the _ phantom quintessence _",
    "sector ( with negative kinetic energy of the scalar field ) , in which extrinsic curvature fluctuations ( _ kinematical backreaction _ ) grow slightly .",
    "we shall adopt this ( present ) value of the curvature parameter in our analysis as an extreme candidate for a backreaction ",
    "driven cosmology .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that we are looking at spatial integral properties of inhomogeneous _ models _ of the universe at the present time",
    ". this study does not include the important questions of ( i ) how the present  day structure we are looking at evolved dynamically out of an earlier state , and ( ii ) how these integral properties would relate to deep observations that necessarily involve considerations of the inhomogeneous lightcone and observable averages along the lightcone .",
    "we shall later propose strategies for the determination of these integral properties , also from observations . as a rule of thumb",
    ", observational results may be directly used in a shallow redshift interval , where the lightcone effect would be subdominant ; galaxy catalogues as they are compared with the spatial distribution of fluctuations `` at the present time '' in simulations is an example ) .",
    "our main result is a formula for the spatially averaged scalar curvature involving quantities that are all measurable on regional ( i.e. up to 100 mpc ) scales , and it is therefore accessible by a shallow redshift interval .    the key",

    "it is difficult to argue , if the @xmath319@xmath319 current correlation length @xmath392 is smaller , larger or comparable to the expansion fluctuation length @xmath393 . on the one hand ,",
    "the above estimate indicates that the attenuation mechanism due to shear fluctuations can not compensate for the _ global _",
    "( i.e. on the homogeneity scale ) negative contribution generated by @xmath394 and @xmath395 , since  due to the assumption of existence of a scale of homogeneity and , in addition , due to our implicit assumption of a globally almost isotropic state",
    " the large  scale bulk flow must cease to display correlations and will be on some large scale subordered to the global hubble flow pattern .",
    "this latter , however , could display large  scale fluctuations or not , and it is therefore to be expected that the ratio of the correlation lengths must be small , in conformity with our setup , only if there are significant differences between the globally averaged _ homogeneous state _ and a _ homogeneous solution _ which , this latter , features no fluctuations . on the other hand , we are confident that , on the void scale , the two correlation lengths are certainly comparable , and the shear term may also dominate over the expansion fluctuation term in @xmath396 .",
    "this latter property was generically found in the newtonian analysis @xcite and it can be summarized by the expectation that the kinematical backreaction term would act as a _ kinematical dark matter _ rather than as a _ kinematical dark energy _ on the scale of voids ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , whereby on the global scale the domination of the expansion fluctuation term is possible and would then argue for an interpretation as _ kinematical dark energy_.    it appears to us that this is a fixed point of the analysis , since in any case a non  vanishing fraction @xmath397 and @xmath398 is going to add a negative contribution to @xmath399 ( a positive contribution to @xmath400 ) and , therefore , neglecting this term will still allow us to provide bounds on the expected ( or for some model prior necessary ) fluctuations . as an estimate for the large  scale asymptotics we may ,",
    "along the lines of this reasoning , propose the following simple formula for a rough , but to our opinion robust _ lower bound _ on a _ negative _ kinematical backreaction parameter , valid on the largest scales : @xmath401 with this formula we can bound a positive kinematical backreaction @xmath399 from above , which provides information on the maximally expected backreaction and , in turn , on the maximally expected magnitude of the global averaged scalar curvature , to which we turn now .",
    "adopting the above restrictions of the general formula ( [ resultq ] ) we can write down an estimate for a global _ upper bound _ on the sum of a _ positive _ curvature parameter ( corresponding to a negative averaged curvature ) and the cosmological constant parameter , valid on the homogeneity scale . using ( [ hamiltonomegad ] ) , ( [ result_idealq ] ) , and @xmath402 , we immediately get @xmath403 + \\lambda_{{\\cal m}}\\left[-\\omega^{{\\cal m}}_m + \\frac{\\delta ^{2}h_{{\\cal m}}}{h_{{\\cal d}}^{2}}\\right]+ \\lambda_{{\\cal m}}(1-\\lambda_{{\\cal m}})\\frac{(h_{{\\cal e}}- h_{{\\cal m}})^2 } { h_{{\\cal d}}^2 } \\;.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above formula demonstrates that the major players in a discussion on the maximal magnitude of the averaged scalar curvature will be ( i ) the volume fraction of occupied regions , ( ii ) the matter densities on the two regional scales , and ( iii ) the fluctuations in the volume  averaged hubble parameters on the two regional scales , all normalized by the global volume hubble rate that , this latter , can also be determined through measurement of regional parameters in view of @xmath404 .",
    "we are now going to discuss this latter result more quantitatively .",
    "first , an important remark that is relevant irrespective of whether we use a simple or a more refined estimating formula , and also irrespective of how exactly we determine the right  hand  side of , e.g. the inequality ( [ result_idealr ] ) from models or observations : in any case we would obtain a non  conclusive result for the value of the averaged scalar curvature itself due to the obvious degeneracy of the left  hand  side of eq .",
    "( [ result_idealr ] ) .",
    "this latter depends on the value for the cosmological constant parameter that we have to choose _ ad hoc_. for example , suppose that the right  hand  side of ( [ result_idealr ] ) ( representing the measured physical properties ) would return a value @xmath405 ( now and in what follows concentrating on values today ) , we could not discriminate between the _ concordance model _ , i.e. adopting @xmath406 , and at the same time @xmath407 , and a backreaction",
    " driven cosmology with an intrinsic physical curvature parameter @xmath408 and vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "such a value would therefore be compatible with two models of very different physical nature . an estimate would only be conclusive by setting a prior on the value of the cosmological constant . only in the case where we would `` exorcise '' a cosmological constant , @xmath409 , a measurement of the right  hand  side of ( [ result_idealr ] ) would be conclusive , since we could clearly discriminate between a zero  curvature universe model and a model with large curvature parameter .",
    "this degeneracy provides an obstacle especially in the expected cases of ( i ) the need of a dominating positive cosmological constant in the concordance model , and ( ii ) a substantial negative averaged curvature in a backreaction ",
    "driven cosmology ( since in that case , by definition , @xmath410 ) . however , despite this degeneracy , the physical status of the _ concordance model _ is weaker , since a conspiracy is required between the scale  independent value of the cosmological constant and the scale  dependent physical averages that can in principle be measured on any scale : even if such a conspiracy would hold on the largest scale @xmath235 , it is likely to be violated on smaller scales , a remark that essentially mirrors the status of a `` fitting model '' compared to a physical model for the averaged variables .",
    "notwithstanding , an estimate of the right  hand  side of ( [ result_idealr ] ) , or the more general formulae derived in this paper , is possible and useful , and we are now suggesting strategies for its realization .",
    "despite the fact that we wish to estimate riemannian properties of the present  day universe , the derived estimates for the large  scale averaged scalar curvature are determined by average properties on the scales of voids and matter  dominated regions .",
    "this in turn would suggest , as a first approximation , to determine the required _ regional _ parameters from a standard newtonian n  body simulation .",
    "thereby we accept to ignore the differences to the values that would be obtained for the riemannian averages , but we expect to get an idea for the relative magnitudes of matter and expansion fluctuations within a well  studied framework .",
    "the determination of the regional parameters has to be done by controlled n ",
    "body simulations , this control respecting the mutual dependence of all the parameters involved : the volume fraction of matter  dominated regions , the calculation of averages and their fluctuation properties ; both sensibly depend on spatial and particle resolution as well as on definitions of , e.g. void  finding algorithms and the employed thresholds on what we consider as over and underdensities . in any case",
    "it is important to determine values within a _ single _ set of priors on the construction of the simulation and attaching a precise meaning to the involved parameters .",
    "alternatively , an analytical estimate using relativistic models for the inhomogeneities can be investigated , first using perturbation theory along the lines of @xcite , and its nonlinear extensions @xcite , or studying constraints on the size of voids from swiss cheese  type or peak models @xcite . in this context",
    "we are currently generalizing the newtonian analysis @xcite , which is built on a relativistic generalization of a non  perturbative evolution model . in this model ,",
    "the ( root of the ) metric fluctuations are calculated perturbatively , which is sensible , since the amplitude of metric perturbations is indeed small .",
    "combining this with the exact averages then allows to take into account that the metric derivatives may not be small .",
    "in all these cases we can directly estimate the shear terms , since the assumption of a frame comoving with matter is adopted .",
    "related to the time ",
    "evolution properties in n  body simulations or explicit analytical models we may also approach the problem dynamically from the point of view of effective ( spatially averaged ) einstein equations .",
    "we may focus on the dynamical late  time properties of typical regions on the regional scales . as an example we may exploit the kinematically averaged einstein equations @xcite , valid on any scale , and roughly estimate their time ",
    "asymptotics for a typical matter  dominated region .",
    "the aim would consist in understanding gravitationally bound systems and a corresponding virial equilibrium assumption that would constrain the involved energies .",
    "for example , if such a virialized state is characterized by a stationary `` stable  clustering '' volume @xmath411 , then the averaged raychaudhuri equation @xcite on @xmath18 provides a relation between the averaged matter density and the kinematical fluctuations , together with the corresponding adimensional parameter , as an average over kinematical terms that include other forces relevant on regions @xmath18 .",
    "this term could have any sign and would be associated with velocity dispersion ( compare @xcite for a derivation of the corresponding non  averaged terms in a newtonian setting ",
    "note also that vorticity is an important stabilization term that would have to be included in such a constraint ) . ] : @xmath412 such a condition would replace the need for estimating fluctuations on typical domains @xmath18 .",
    "with neglection of the shear term and terms contained in @xmath413 the above relation would read @xmath414 , or @xmath415 , which still requires estimation of @xmath416 .",
    "the most direct , a priori model ",
    "independent strategy is , of course , to determine the values of the required parameters through observations .",
    "while this strategy is in principle free of priors on the spatial geometry , the _ interpretation _ of observational results has to involve model priors .",
    "note that , at any rate , a model  dependence arises due to the fact that a volume  averaged value needs information on metrical properties , i.e. the volume depends on the geometry which is not directly observable ( see , e.g. , @xcite for strategies related to the determination of metrical properties ) .",
    "actually all ingredients that are needed in our estimates are controversal in the literature , and accordingly an observational determination would involve an ample range of values for the parameters and would suffer from the fact that different methods and interpretation mechanisms are necessarily involved and consequently would imply a loss of control on the mutual dependence of the parameters .",
    "let us now put different model assumptions on the averaged curvature into perspective by just choosing some numbers for the physical properties on the regional domains .",
    "we write down the bound ( [ result_idealr ] ) for ( i ) the _ concordance model _ with ( let us take rough numbers ) @xmath417 , @xmath418 , @xmath419 , and ( ii ) an extreme _ backreaction  driven model _ with @xmath417 , @xmath420 , and @xmath421 ; we obtain on the left  hand  side of ( [ result_idealr ] ) the value lhs@xmath422 for the former and lhs@xmath423 for the latter .",
    "the right  hand  side of ( [ result_idealr ] ) reads : @xmath424 @xmath425 here , we have first ignored the possibility of choosing different values for the regional matter  density parameters to ease the comparison . to make the average expansion properties concrete , we employ our scaling models for @xmath426 and @xmath427 ,",
    "( [ scalingmodel1])ff . , with a transition value @xmath428 .",
    "the reader may now specify the free parameters involved ( @xmath429 , @xmath430 , @xmath431 ) .",
    "considering a maximal range for the volume fraction , @xmath432 , we then obtain rhs = @xmath433 for a completely empty universe model , and rhs = @xmath434 , for a volume  equipartition of over and underdense regions .",
    "this shows how global constraints imposed by our model priors would constrain the fluctuation terms .",
    "e.g. , a value of @xmath435 would be the minimally necessary fluctuation amplitude of the expansion rate on the void scale , if the expectation from the extreme backreaction  driven model , that has practically emptied the universe , is met . for a non ",
    "zero @xmath429 we have to also specify @xmath431 .",
    "as another example let us now assume different density parameters on the different regions .",
    "for a range of values for the volume fraction of occupied regions @xmath436 ( remember that this parameter is the relativistic volume fraction ) , we for example get with the priors on the global density parameter , @xmath437 , and the density in voids @xmath438 ( i.e. roughly 10 percent of the average density is found in voids ) the corresponding values @xmath439 . by working out a stationarity assumption in line with ( [ virial ] )",
    ", we could then find @xmath431 directly from the density parameter in matter  dominated regions .    at this stage",
    "we leave it to the reader to exploit the result further and to understand the relations of assumed or measured numbers to the global model priors according to his / her experience .      in order to reconcile the standard concordance model with the estimated bounds on the averaged scalar curvature",
    ", the above discussion indicates that this would be difficult , since for an assumed cosmological constant parameter of @xmath405 , the curvature parameter acquires _ additive _ pieces due to the fluctuations of the hubble parameter on the two regional scales .",
    "overall , the above ( rough ) discussion would suggest that , independent of the prior on a specific value of the cosmological constant parameter in between @xmath322 and a value that compensates the matter density parameter ( in our example @xmath405 ) , the averaged curvature would be negative .",
    "the remaining question is , how robust this latter result is , given our assumptions . for this purpose",
    "we are taking the role of advocating the standard concordance model by pushing the estimates to their extremes .",
    "for this end we have to argue that all the additional contributions due to inhomogeneities are negligible , so that our formulae in fact reduce to the standard hamiltonian constraint for a homogeneous distribution of matter and curvature . only in this case the concordance model , i.e. a zero  curvature universe model , can be reconciled with the _",
    "physical space_. this statement implies that there must be a conspiracy between ( a1 ) the shear terms on _ both _ regional scales , ( a2 ) the expansion terms on _ both _ regional scales , and ( a3 ) the difference between the hubble rates on those regional scales , such that the overall contribution of these terms cancels on the homogeneity scale .",
    "alternatively , we could conjecture that ( b1 ) the magnitudes of the involved fluctuation amplitudes in our formulae are quantitatively negligible and ( b2 ) that @xmath440 .",
    "however , these latter options are unrealistic , since we would have to require negligible fluctuation amplitudes also on regional scales ( ad b1 ) , and that e.g. a cluster of galaxies participates in the full hubble flow ( ad b2 ) .",
    "whether the above conspiracy ( a ) could hold is difficult to test .",
    "however , we know that it holds in a newtonian model due to boundary conditions @xcite , @xcite , i.e. this conspiracy is suggesting that the present  day universe can be effectively described in newtonian terms @xcite , i.e. it is equivalent to saying that the structure formation history had no impact on the evolution of the averaged curvature , and fluctuations have been decoupled from the geometry ( being a dynamical variable in general relativity ) until today .",
    "although we can not exclude this possibility , it relies on a fine  tuning assumption that can be physically justified for a euclidean universe model , where the curvature distribution trivially satisfies an equipartition law ( since there is no curvature ) .",
    "as we have discussed , we can not expect such an equipartition of curvature in the general case , especially when the partitioning is biased towards a volume  dominance of underdense regions ( negative curvature ) .",
    "thus , to reconcile the standard concordance model with the physical average of the present  day universe is essentially equivalent with postulating an equipartition law for the scalar curvature on the homogeneity scale @xmath235 , hence a fine  tuning assumption on the curvature distribution .",
    "here , one should be aware of the fact that such an equipartition law must be the result of a conservation law for the scalar curvature in a dynamical situation , similar as an equipartition of the density distribution on @xmath235 being the result of restmass conservation .",
    "we know that such a conservation law does not exist in general .",
    "in the case of a dust matter model it is replaced by the condition ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) : @xmath441 i.e. a particular dynamical combination of kinematical fluctuations and averaged scalar curvature is conserved , not the averaged scalar curvature itself , that here would be represented by the conservation of the yamabe functional @xmath442 .",
    "this does not mean that such a conservation law is excluded , but it would be equivalent to an uncoupled evolution of fluctuations in a constant  curvature space section , since @xmath443 implies @xmath444 .",
    "it is interesting that the mechanism of a backreaction  driven model relies on a coupled evolution between @xmath445 and @xmath12 ( thoroughly discussed in @xcite ) , hence , it genuinely violates an equipartition of curvature .      we conclude that we need a fine  tuning assumption on the scalar curvature distribution ( an equipartition law on the scale of homogeneity ) in order to reconcile the concordance model as a viable model for the physical properties of the present  day universe .",
    "dynamically , this hypothesis implies an uncoupled evolution of kinematical fluctuations and intrinsic curvature . if such a hypothesis is not adopted , our investigations point to an overall negative averaged scalar curvature .",
    "measuring fluctuations in the volume hubble rate on the two regional scales together with the volume fraction of occupied regions would allow us to support or to rule out a large negative averaged scalar curvature , required for an extreme backreaction  driven model , only if @xmath26 .",
    "the crux in this consideration is the degeneracy by assuming a non ",
    "zero cosmological constant .",
    "however , if the large value for the fluctuations needed for a backreaction  driven model is achievable ( for calculations and discussions of estimates see @xcite ; @xcite , sect.3.3 ; @xcite and @xcite ) , there would be good reasons to shift our _ interpretation _ from the assumption of a `` curvature  compensating '' @xmath63 to the acceptance of a substantial negative physical curvature .",

    "<S> we discuss the effect of curvature and matter inhomogeneities on the averaged scalar curvature of the present  day universe . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by studies of averaged inhomogeneous cosmologies , we contemplate on the question whether it is sensible to assume that curvature averages out on some scale of homogeneity , as implied by the standard concordance model of cosmology , or whether the averaged scalar curvature can be largely negative today , as required for an explanation of dark energy from inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> we confront both conjectures with a detailed analysis of the kinematical backreaction term and estimate its strength for a multi  scale inhomogeneous matter and curvature distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is a formula for the spatially averaged scalar curvature involving quantities that are all measurable on regional ( i.e. up to 100 mpc ) scales . </S>",
    "<S> we propose strategies to quantitatively evaluate the formula , and pinpoint the assumptions implied by the conjecture of a small or zero averaged curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we reach the conclusion that the standard concordance model needs fine  tuning in the sense of an assumed equipartition law for curvature in order to reconcile it with the estimated properties of the averaged physical space , whereas a negative averaged curvature is favoured , independent of the prior on the value of the cosmological constant . </S>"
