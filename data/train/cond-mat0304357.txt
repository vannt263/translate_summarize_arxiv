    "wetting phenomena occur in a large variety of experiments , where a planar substrate is exposed to a gas phase under thermal equilibrium conditions .",
    "generally , ` wetting ' refers to a situation where a bulk phase @xmath1 in contact with a substrate coexists with a layer of a different phase ( @xmath2 ) which is preferentially attracted to the surface of the substrate . by changing physical parameters such as temperature and chemical potential , the system may undergo a wetting transition from a non - wet phase , where the thickness of the layer stays finite , to a wet phase , where the layer becomes macroscopic .",
    "the phase diagram associated with the surface layer could be rather complex exhibiting a variety of surface phase transitions , prewetting phenomena and multicritical behavior  @xcite .",
    "for example , by increasing the temperature @xmath3 while moving along the @xmath4-@xmath2 coexistence curve , a wetting transition may take place at a temperature @xmath5 , beyond which the thickness of the layer becomes infinite .",
    "usually this transition is first order , although in certain models the transition is continuous , and is then referred to as continuous wetting . on the other hand , when the chemical potential difference between the two phases is varied , moving towards the coexistence curve at @xmath6 , a different type of transition takes place in which the thickness of the layer diverges .",
    "this phenomenon is known as complete wetting .    in many experimental situations",
    "it is reasonable to assume that a wetting stationary layer is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact , methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics turned out to be very successful in a large variety of theoretical and experimental studies ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within this approach ,",
    "a wetting transition is usually considered as the unbinding of an interface from a wall .",
    "the interface configuration is described by a function @xmath7 which gives the height of the interface at point @xmath8 on the substrate .",
    "one then introduces an effective hamiltonian of the form  @xcite @xmath9 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the effective surface tension of the @xmath4-@xmath2 interface , @xmath11 is a potential accounting for the interaction between the wall and the interface , and @xmath12 is the interface dimension . in the non - wet phase the potential @xmath13 contains an attractive component which binds the interface to the wall .",
    "assuming thermal equilibrium , the probability of finding the interface in a certain configuration is then given by the canonical distribution @xmath14",
    "\\sim \\exp\\bigl(-\\beta { \\cal h}[h]\\bigr).\\ ] ]",
    "as the parameters describing the system are varied , the attractive component of the potential may become weaker so that it is no longer able to bind the interface , leading to a wetting transition .    in order to study wetting phenomena under thermal equilibrium conditions",
    "one usually introduces a stochastic langevin equation corresponding to the effective hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this langevin dynamics should reproduce the equilibrium distribution  ( [ equilibriumensemble ] ) in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "since many different dynamical rules may approach the same stationary state , this condition does not fully determine the form of the langevin equation .",
    "however , assuming short - range interactions and keeping only the most relevant terms in the renormalization group sense , one is led to the edwards - wilkinson equation with a potential  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a zero - average gaussian noise field with a variance @xmath18 and a noise amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "this langevin equation has the same symmetry properties as the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , namely , it is invariant under translations , rotations , and reflections in space .",
    "apart from the potential term , the equation is also invariant under shifts @xmath20 and reflections @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that this type of langevin dynamics obeys _ detailed balance _ and relaxes towards the equilibrium distribution  ( [ equilibriumensemble ] ) in the bound phase .",
    "wetting phenomena may also take place in many systems under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "for example , in growth processes such as molecular beam epitaxy or others , a layer is grown on a substrate , whose properties depend on the growth conditions . by varying these conditions",
    "one expects wetting phenomena to take place . here ,",
    "unlike the equilibrium case , the dynamics does not obey detailed balance , leading to a rather different class of wetting phenomena .",
    "the simplest way to study nonequilibrium wetting on the level of the langevin equation is to introduce a nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ ew ] ) , leading to a kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation with a potential  @xcite @xmath22 it is important to note that this nonlinear term is a relevant perturbation of the underlying field theory , i.e. , even if @xmath23 is very small , it will be amplified under renormalization group transformations , driving the system away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "recently , a simple solid - on - solid ( sos ) model for non - equilibrium wetting in @xmath0 dimensions was introduced  @xcite .",
    "the model is controlled by an adsorption rate @xmath24 and a desorption rate @xmath25 and exhibits a continuous wetting transition at a critical growth rate @xmath26 .",
    "the wetting transition is related to the unpinning process of an interface from a substrate and may be described by the kpz equation  ( [ langevinequation ] ) .",
    "the model has then been generalized to include a short - range interaction between the interface and the substrate  @xcite .",
    "this was done by introducing a modified growth rate @xmath27 at the substrate level .",
    "this results in a contact interaction between the interface and the substrate , which is attractive for @xmath28 and repulsive for @xmath29 .",
    "it was found that sufficiently strong attractive interaction modifies the nature of the wetting transition , making it first order .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that there exists an extended region in the phase diagram , where the pinned and the moving phases _ coexist _ in the sense that the transition time from the pinned to the moving phase grows exponentially with the system size so that the two phases become stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it should be emphasized that this kind of phase coexistence , which has also been observed in the past in other models  @xcite , can only occur in nonequilibrium systems .    some of these results have been confirmed by numerical and mean field studies of kpz type models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , by adding a repulsive interaction between the interface and the substrate , a crossover from a continuous to a first order wetting transition was found .",
    "non - equilibrium wetting phenomena have also been studied recently in models of growing magnetic domains  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed account of the phase diagram of the sos model in 1 + 1 dimensions . in order to get some indication on the behavior of the model in higher dimensions",
    "we introduce a mean field approximation for the model , and study the resulting phase diagram and the dynamical behavior of the interface .",
    "it is found that the mean field approximation reproduces the main qualitative features of the phase diagram obtained in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in addition , a new feature is found in the pinned phase . by studying the height distribution of the pinned interface",
    ", two distinct types of behavior are discovered upon varying the dynamical parameters of the model : in one regime the distribution decays superexponentially with the height , while in the other the decay is exponential .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a prewetting transition line .",

    "such a force can be taken into account by introducing a different growth rate @xmath27 for deposition at zero height .",
    "the influence of this parameter was studied in detail in ref .",
    "since @xmath27 does not influence the propagation velocity of the interface far away from the wall , the location of the transition line , along which the moving phase is stable , remains unchanged .",
    "however , if @xmath27 is smaller than a certain threshold @xmath58 , the attractive interaction is so strong as to stabilize the bound phase even when the free interface would grow . in other words , for very low values of @xmath27",

    "the upper boundary of the coexistence region depends on @xmath27 , as shown in fig .",
