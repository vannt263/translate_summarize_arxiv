    "these systems exhibit rich collective behaviors including synchrony and spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .",
    "most of the earlier theoretical works on these systems assume either local coupling ( nearest - neighbor interactions ) or global coupling ( infinite - range interactions ) ; a third type named non - locally coupling began to be explored in the past years , which is somewhere between local coupling and global coupling .",
    "in non - local coupled systems , the oscillators interact with all others and the strength between oscillators varies with the distance between them .",
    "chimera state is a spatiotemporal pattern in which some of the identical oscillators are coherent and synchronous while others remain incoherent @xcite .",
    "they usually appear in systems with non - local coupling and could only be built for proper initial conditions @xcite .",
    "chimera state does not relate to the partially synchronized states observed in populations of nonidentical oscillators with dispersive frequencies in which the splitting of the population roots in the inhomogeneity of the oscillator themselves and the intrinsically fastest or slowest oscillators remain desynchronized . its emergence can not be ascribed to a supercritical instability of the spatially uniform oscillation , because it occurs even if the uniform state is stable .",

    ", chimera state was first reported by kuramoto and his colleagues @xcite when simulating the non - locally coupled complex ginzburg - landau equation .",

    "strogatz @xcite found an exact solution for this state in a ring of phase oscillators coupled by a cosine kernel .",
    "recently , two interesting findings on chimera state are reported .",
    "firstly , in the study of the non - locally coupled oscillators with time delay @xcite , clustered chimera state that has spatially distributed phase coherence separated by incoherence with adjacent coherent regions in antiphase , was found .",
    "the observed clustered chimera state in these systems is stationary and its pattern does not change with time .",
    "secondly , abrams and strogatz @xcite found a breathing chimera state in a model consisting of two interacting subpopulations of oscillators .",
    "pikovsky and rosenblum @xcite considered oscillators ensembles consisting of several subpopulations of identical units , with a general heterogeneous coupling between subpopulations , through which they acquired quasiperiodic chimera states .",
    "laing @xcite summarized chimera states in several heterogeneous networks of coupled phase oscillators , in the mean time , he analyzed chimera state applying the ott - antonsen ansatz @xcite in one - dimensional and two - dimensional systems .",
    "he pointed out that , in one - dimensional system , when parameter heterogeneity is introduced , a breathing chimera state exists .    in this work ,",
    "we study a one - dimensional array of non - locally coupled identical phase oscillators .",
    "we find that , in the absence of time delay , a two - cluster chimera state could exist .",
    "we also find that , in the absence of parameter heterogeneity , the two - cluster chimera state is not stationary but oscillating .",
    "different from laing s results @xcite , we find that the oscillation of the two - cluster chimera state only exists for the system with a finite number of oscillators . both the two - clustered chimera state and finite size oscillations of the chimera state in this model are analyzed based on the ott - antonsen ansatz .",

    "1(b ) reveals two features on @xmath22 for the two - cluster chimera state .",
    "firstly , the oscillators can be divided into two domains which join at the minimum of @xmath22 and the curve of @xmath22 against the locations of oscillators does not show symmetry about the minimum of @xmath22 .",
    "further explorations show that @xmath22 is a function of time . as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) where the spatiotemporal evolution of @xmath22 is featured , @xmath22 is oscillating in each coherent cluster .",
    "especially , when @xmath22 reaches its minimum in one domain , @xmath22 in the other one reaches its maximum .",
    "secondly , the boundaries of the coherent clusters are not determined by the condition of @xmath47 and the coherent regimes are narrower than those expected according to @xmath47 in most of the time , which are different from the stationary chimera state .",
    "the reason for this observation roots in the time - dependent order parameter @xmath22 .",
    "actually , for a forced phase oscillator obeying @xmath48 , the synchronization of the phase oscillator by the force just requires the phase of the oscillator to be confined within @xmath49 but not to a fixed value , which leads the onset of the synchronization of the oscillator not to obey the condition of @xmath50 and the onset of synchronization strongly depends on the details of the functional form of @xmath51 . to be noted , even though @xmath22 is time - dependent",
    ", the oscillators in the coherent clusters still have the same angular velocity which does not fluctuate as exhibited by zero @xmath46 .",
    "the spatiotemporal evolution of @xmath22 in fig .",
    "1(d ) shows another feature : the two - cluster chimera state displays an irregular motion along the ring , for example , the locations of coherent clusters vary with time .",
    "similar phenomenon is also observed for the chimera state with a single cluster @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the snapshot and the time evolution of @xmath23 presented in fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( e ) show that @xmath23 is almost uniform in each domain except for those near the junction between domains and there is a phase difference of @xmath52 for @xmath23 in different domains . to be stressed , the features on @xmath23 revealed by fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( e ) could be used as a more general scheme for the initial conditions to generate an oscillating two - cluster chimera state .",
    "that is , the initial conditions in eq .",

    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the differences with those in fig . 1",
    "are that the pattern of two - cluster chimera state becomes stationary in space and , no matter where the chimera state is initialized , it will adjust its pattern to be symmetrical about the center of the chain where the minimum of @xmath22 appears .",
    "the analysis above are made on the system with @xmath28 .",
    "one question is how the observed two - cluster oscillating chimera state depends on the number of oscillators . for this aim ,",
    "we focus on one domain and record the maximum value of @xmath22 in this domain at any time instance ( we denote it as @xmath63 ) . the time - dependent behavior of the two - cluster chimera state can be reflected by the time evolution of @xmath63 .",
    "for example , a constant @xmath63 indicates a stationary chimera state , otherwise an oscillating one . to avoid the influences induced by the irregular motion of the chimera state along the ring in the system with periodic boundary condition",
    ", we let @xmath42 .",
    "the results for different @xmath65 are presented in fig .",
    "one remarkable feature revealed by the figure is that , before the oscillating chimera state is established , the system first evolves to a two - cluster chimera state which looks like a stationary one due to the weak oscillation of @xmath63 .",
    "however , the `` stationary '' state is not stable and its instability leads to the appearance of an oscillating chimera state .",
    "interestingly , the stationary value of @xmath63 is independent of the size of the system and the time consumed for the system to build an oscillating state becomes much longer as the number of the oscillator @xmath65 increases .",
    "another feature in fig.[rmax ] is that larger @xmath65 seems to weaken the oscillation of @xmath63 in the two - cluster oscillating chimera state , which is prominent by the comparison between fig .",
