    "filaments / prominences are the cool ( @xmath5 k ) and denser ( @xmath6 ) plasma material embedded in the magnetic field of the ambient solar atmosphere ( mackay et al . 2010 ; labrosse et al .",
    "filaments and prominences are the same solar magnetic structures but appear distinctly due to their projection .",
    "prominences , when observed on the disk , are known as solar filaments that lie along the polarity inversion line ( durrant 2002 ; filippov & srivastava 2011 ) .",
    "filaments may remain in the quiescent state for several days over the solar disk , while some filaments may exhibit eruptive nature .",
    "filament eruption occurs mainly due to the non - equilibrium between the upward magnetic pressure and the downward magnetic tension , or due to the tether cutting between magnetic flux ropes containing filaments and overlaying arcades ( mackay et al .",
    "filaments show different types of eruptions such as failed eruption ( liu et al .",
    "2009 ) , partial eruption ( tripathi et al . 2009 ) , and full eruption ( schrijver et al . 2008 ; chandra et al . 2010 ) .",
    "apart from these eruptions , filament can also undergo an asymmetric eruption with its one footpoint fixed in the photosphere ( anchored leg ) while the other participating in the dynamic motion ( active leg ) ( liu et al .",
    "2009 ; yang et al .",
    "eruption of a flux rope can be partial or full that also depends on the overlying magnetic field configuration . recently , kumar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) observed a huge flux - rope failed in the eruption , and found that the overlying filament remnant and coronal magnetic field caused its suppression .",
    "it is widely reported in the literatures that the emergence of new magnetic flux , generation of the high critical twist , low - lying atmospheric reconnections , can generate the eruptions and instability of the flux - ropes that may further lead to the outer coronal transients ( srivastava et al .",
    "2010 ; chandra et al . 2011 ; yan et al . 2012 ; zhang et al . 2012 ; botha et al . 2012",
    "; srivastava et al .",
    "however , it is also found that these conditions may only be the necessary conditions , which , may not be the sufficient conditions for the solar eruptions .",
    "the configuration of the ambient magnetic field as well as its strength may also play a role in deciding the nature and morphology of the eruptions ( kumar et al .",
    "2011 , reference cited therein ) .",
    "eruptive filaments are closely associated with coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "cmes are the propulsion of large - scale plasma and magnetic field into outer coronal and interplanetary space ( joshi et al .",
    "in general , a cme has a three part structure , i.e. , a leading edge , dark cavity , and bright core associated with the eruptive filament ( riley et al .",
    "2008 , and reference therein ) .",
    "cmes produce outward movement in the corona , and it may be either driven by the magnetic pressure or shock into the background of ambient solar wind ( filippov & srivastava 2010 ) . the less denser outer corona sometime shows downflows of the plasma blobs , cme cores , etc .",
    "such downflows of the magneto - plasma are collectively termed as `` coronal inflows '' or `` coronal downflows '' .",
    "various kinds of downflows / inflows into the solar corona have been observed and analyzed , which include the prominence fall back ( tripathi et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) , dwonflow over the post flare arcades ( innes et al . 2003",
    "; mckenzie & hudson 1999 ; mckenzie 2000 ; asai et al .",
    "2004 ) , inflow of small faint plasma structures and blobs , etc ( wang et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; wang & sheeley 2002 ; sheeley & wang 2002 ) .",
    "innes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observed a series of dark , sunward moving flows , which were seen against the bright extreme ultraviolet post flare arcades of the large eruptive flare on 1999 april 21 .",
    "asai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) examined the downflow motion above flare loops observed on 2002 july 23 , and found that the plasma downflow occurred when the magnetic energy was released .",
    "in all these examples , the reconnection is responsible for the downflows in the inner solar corona . in spite of such observed downflows in the inner corona , reconnection in the outer corona",
    "may also be responsible for downflows there .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported various small and fainter plasma flows moving through the corona , and found that these inward motions are the observational signature of the gradual closing - down of magnetic flux - tubes dragged outward by the cmes or other transient outflows .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the variety of small scale downflowing structures during the high solar activity ( e.g. , plasma blobs ) and interpreted that these downflows were due to the magnetic reconnection between the closed and open field regions of the corona .",
    "sheeley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported that the inflow rate was dominated by transient bursts , which were correlated with the existence of non - polar coronal holes and other signatures of the solar non - axisymmetric open field structures .",
    "wang & sheeley ( 2002 ) and sheeley & wang ( 2002 ) identified faint , inward - moving features , e.g. , collapsing loops , sinking plasma columns , falling plasma curtains , in and out pairs of oppositely directed plasma ejecta , and downflow of the core of cme at heliocentric distances from 2 - 6 @xmath2 , and interpreted them as an initiation stage of the large - scale magnetic reconnection .",
    "tripathi et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) also reported coronal downflows in the course of prominence eruption and associated coronal mass ejection on 2000 march 5 , and interpreted that the origin of such downflows may be due to the reconnection inside the bifurcating flux - rope .",
    "as said above , the cme core some time exhibits downfall depending upon the local magnetic field and plasma configurations , and the most probable reason may be the pre - settings of the large - scale reconnection in the outer corona .",
    "the cme itself can also produce several changes in the outer coronal magnetic fields in form of the deflection of coronal streamers , kink propagation in coronal rays , etc ( filippov & srivastava 2010 ) .",
    "filippov & srivastava ( 2010 ) analyzed the events of the interaction of cmes with the coronal rays observed by soho / lasco , and interpreted these deflections as the influence of magnetic field of a moving flux rope associated with the cme on the remote coronal rays . in the present paper ,",
    "we report multi - wavelength investigation of asymmetric filament evolution and eruption , associated cme , coronal downflows , and their relationship using the observations from solar dynamic observatory / atmospheric imaging assembly ( sdo / aia ) , solar terrestrial relation observatory / sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( stereo / secchi ) and solar and heliospheric observatory / large angle and spectrometer coronagraph ( soho / lasco ) c2 instruments on 2012 june 17 - 18 during 20:0005:00 ut .",

    "the two ribbons of the flare ( indicated by r1 and r2 at the snapshot of 21:06:36 ut ) are clearly visible .",

    "the velocity and acceleration profiles are derived by differentiating the above equation at each point along the height - time profile ( fig .",

    "the cme core shows continuous deceleration .",
    "the deceleration rate changes from the initial value of -48 m s@xmath3 to -19 m s@xmath3 at the maximum height .",

    "we also plot the velocity and acceleration profiles of the cme core w.r.t .",
    "radial distance .",
    "the initial velocity at @xmath02.54 @xmath2 is @xmath0312 km s@xmath1 , which continuously decreases with height and becomes zero at @xmath04.33 @xmath2 ( cf . ,",

    "the value of deceleration / acceleration during the motion of the core was not matching to the local gravitational acceleration @xmath15 ( wang & sheeley 2002 ) ( cf .",
    "this evidently shows that the gravity is not the dominant factor for the observed downward motion .",
    "we also observe the interaction of the cme with the coronal ray in the northward direction of the outward moving core . the red curve in the fig .",
    "10a shows the coronal ray deflection from its mean position at a height of @xmath03.1 @xmath2 .",
    "the deflection started around 22:12 ut on 2012 june 17 soon after the appearance of cme core in the lasco field of view and continued with the upward motion of the cme .",

    "the observations of the asymmetric filament eruption , formation of the two ribbon flare , and their relationship with the cme and the outer coronal downflows are discussed in detail in the previous section . in the present section ,",
    "we describe the possible physical scenarios and theoretical interpretations for the observed coronal dynamics .",
    "the asymmetric flux - rope eruptions are studied by various authors ( tripathi et al .",
    "2006 ; liu et al .",
    "2009 , and reference therein ) .",
    "we observed the whipping - like asymmetric filament eruption .",
    "the whipping like asymmetric filament eruption is characterized when active leg whips upward , and hard x - ray sources shift toward the end of the anchored leg ( liu et al .",
    "we do not have the x - ray observations in our case .",
    "however , we could not find any evidence of the transport of flare ribbon brightening ( low energy counterparts ) towards the encored leg of the filament .",
    "this is some what unique situation differing from the observations of liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in the present observational base - line , it is clear that the northern part of the filament has comparatively homogeneous overlying corona , while its southern part experienced the crossing overlying thin and brightened flux - tubes . in the south - east direction of it",
    ", there was a moderate active region whose arches were crossing above the southward part of the filament and made it initially suppressed . during the whipping motion of the southern part of filament",
    "these overlaying magnetic flux - tubes probably allow only the formation of a compact two ribbon flare beneath the eruptive part of the filament .",
    "this flare brightness does not spread much along the neutral line as in the case of large flares ( benz 2008 ) .",
    "the filament erupts asymmetrically and the two ribbon flare occurs beneath of it .",
    "the flare may be triggered due to reconnection in the vertical current sheet between surrounding coronal fields in the wake of the eruptive filament ( carmichael 1964 ; sturrock 1966 ; hirayama 1974 ; kopp & pneuman 1976 ; shibata 1999 , reference cited therein ) . as the reconnection progresses as per those canonical models , formation of post - flare loops , propagation of the brightening along the ribbons as well as their separation are evident in the lower part of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the eruptive filament further leads to a cme whose core is constituted by it .",
    "the degree of asymmetry in this eruption is large .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "8 that inspite of radial motion , the filament expands in the outer corona ( cme core ) almost at an angle of @xmath17 and constitutes the outer coronal dynamics in form of downflow .",
    "the core later on shows the downflow of its plasma .",
    "the physical reason in the present observational base - line may be two - fold , e.g. , ( i ) the self - consistent equilibrium of the flux - rope below a critical height , during its subsequent eruption in form of whipping motion and formation of the cme s core ( filippov et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "( ii ) the interaction of the moving cme core with the ambient medium that drags out its momentum ( wang & sheeley 2002 ) . before the start of downflow",
    ", cme core causes the deflection of a coronal ray in the northward direction in the lasco c2 field - of - view ( cf .",
    "fig .  9 ) .",
    "the deflection measurement has been carried out at a height of around @xmath03.1 @xmath2 .",
    "the ray started deflecting around 22:12 ut and reaches up to a maximum displacement of @xmath18 km at @xmath022:36 ut on 2012 june 17 ( cf .",
    "this was the period when cme core was trying to move ahead with the average velocity of @xmath0126 km s@xmath1 ( cf .",
    "10b ) . the coronal ray deflection and its re - storing may be most likely caused by the expansion of the cme - core magnetic field and its interaction with the radial field of the coronal ray ( filippov & srivastava 2010 ) .",
    "however , during the coronal ray restoring motion , the downflow of cme core starts when the coronal ray moved almost 50% towards its equilibrium position on @xmath0 01:00 at 18 june 2012 ( cf .",
    "figs .  9 and 10a ) .",
    "this was the time when cme core starts down flowing with an average speed of around 56 km s@xmath1 .",
    "both the southward opposite motion of coronal ray ( in projection ) , and coronal downflow , were progressed simultaneously later on , and finally ended at @xmath0 03:48 ut on 2012 june 18 .",
    "this interaction and co - temporal dynamics of the coronal ray and coronal downflow is , to the best of our knowledge , observed for the first time in the presented observations .",
    "however , the one - to - one relation between the coronal ray restoring and downflow is not established here as the downflow starts after two hour from the initiation of restoring motion of the deflected coronal ray towards its equilibrium position .",
    "therefore coronal ray deflection may be only the consequence of the upward moving cme , however , it does not start the downflow of cme core",
    ".    the most likely cause may be the self - consistent evolution of the flux - rope itself , which forms the cme core .",
    "we compare the observed evolution of the eruptive filament and cme with the model developed by filippov et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) for the non - radial flux - rope motion previously .",
    "it was applied to the event on 1997 december 14 whose initial phase was very similar to the eruption studied in the present paper . in the december 14 event ,",
    "the filament erupted from middle latitude in the southern hemisphere , while the cme was observed close to the equatorial plane . in the present case , the cme core propagates even at some angle to the north of the equatorial plane ( cf .",
    "in both cases , the filaments passed significant distances along the latitude direction .",
    "however on 1997 december 14 , the true fast cme was observed , while in the present case , on 2012 june 17 - 18 , the cme core is stopped at some height and then fall down .    in the axially - symmetric model of filippov",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , the flux - rope was represented by a thin current - carrying plasma ring ( torus ) with a total electric current @xmath19 located above the photosphere along a heliographic parallel .",
    "a similar model for a ring located in the equatorial plane was analyzed by lin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . after integrating over the torus volume",
    ", we can obtain the equation of motion of the torus as a whole , as well as an equation describing variation of its inner radius .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) with their origin at the solar center and the z axis directed along the rotational axis , the equations of motion for a toroidal segment with unit length take the form    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the mass of the filament per unit length , @xmath26 is the magnetic field produced by sources located beneath the photosphere and by currents in the solar - wind region , @xmath27 is the field produced by inductive currents in the photosphere that prevents the penetration of the coronal - current field into the sun , @xmath28 is the field produced by the current flowing along the ring axis , @xmath29 is the free - fall acceleration at the photospheric level , @xmath30 is the dissipation coefficient , and @xmath31 is the velocity .",
    "we used the same parameters of the model as in filippov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) except the mass of the filament per unit length .",
    "it was chosen as @xmath32 , a more typical value for an average filament , because we do not need to fit the result to the final velocity of @xmath33 .",
    "the global coronal field @xmath26 is represented by two spherical harmonics , dipole and octupole .",
    "these harmonics dominate in the global field in the epoch of solar activity minimum .",
    "our event does not occurr at minimum , however , the level of activity in june 2012 was not very high as the monthly averaged sunspot number was about 60 , thus the global magnetic field configuration was not typical for the maximum .",
    "the harmonic coefficients are chosen in such a way that the magnetic field strength is @xmath34 in the corona near the filament , and there is a null line at the height of @xmath35 above the equator . in this field ,",
    "a flux rope with the current of @xmath36 will be in equilibrium at the height of @xmath37 .",
    "the equilibrium is defined mainly by the components of the lorenz force in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the gravity force is about two orders of magnitude weaker than the electromagnetic forces acting on the filament",
    ". it does not appreciably affect the equilibrium position in the lower corona , however the filament mass is significant for the kinematics of eruption .",
    "each value of the current corresponds to two equilibrium points in this curve - one above and one below some critical point whose current @xmath38 corresponds to a single solution of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with zero left - hand terms .",
    "if the current exceeds the critical value , equilibrium can not be achieved in the corona .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "11 shows the evolution of the flux rope without dissipation after the loss of equilibrium due to the increase of the electric current strength on a small value ( about 2% ) over the critical value .",
    "we see that the true flux rope eruption started in the southern hemisphere and propagating into the northern hemisphere .",
    "it was pointed out by filippov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that there is a stable equilibrium position higher in the corona for the erupting flux rope , but the gained kinetic energy of the flux rope does not allow it to stop in the higher equilibrium position . however ,",
    "if we add some dissipation @xmath39 to the right hand side of the equations of motion , as it was done by filippov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for testing of the initial equilibrium stability , the flux rope can loose its momentum and stop at some height ( the right panels of fig .  11 ) .",
    "we choose the value of @xmath30 as @xmath40 in order to stop the ascending motion of the flux rope at the height of 4 @xmath2 . at the speed of @xmath41",
    ", it creates the drag force @xmath42 dyne per unit length or about an order of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force @xmath43 dyne at the height of 2 @xmath2 .",
    "although we did not apply additional efforts to fit to the observational data , we can see that the kinematics shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "11 is very similar to the observed kinematics presented in fig .",
    "we compare the segments of curves between the dashed vertical lines in fig .",
    "11d with the dotted blue line fitting in fig .",
    "10a and the segments of curves between the dashed vertical lines in fig .",

    "comparison of fig .  8 with the calculated trajectory in fig .",
    "11f also confirms the conclusion that the model rather adequately describes the observed event . however , the nature of the dissipation or the drag force is unclear for us .",
    "possibly it is the aerodynamic drag or includes some additional dissipative mechanisms .",
    "[ sec4 ] we have presented the multi - wavelength analysis and the relationship of whipping - like asymmetric filament eruption , the associated cme , and the outer coronal downflows in the form of cme core on 2012 june 17 - 18 . the summary of the obtained results of this study is as follows : +   + 1 .",
    "the observation shows a whipping like highly asymmetric filament eruption with active ( south - eastern ) leg and the anchored ( north - western ) leg .",
    "during the eruption , a two ribbon flare occurred underneath the eastern part of the filament .",
    "this supports well the standard flare model ( cshkp ) of reconnection .",
    "the deceleration profile of the cme core shows that the gravity is not only the force responsible for the downflow .",
    "the downflow of the cme core has been observed which may be due to the self consistent evolution of the flux - rope in the coronal magnetic field .",
    "coronal ray deflection occurs during the upward motion of the cme , however , it does not reveal exact correlation with the coronal downflows .",
    "+ recently liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented observation of two types of asymmetric filament eruptions , i.e. , whipping and zipping like configurations . in the whipping like eruptions ,",
    "active leg whips upward , and the observed hard x - ray source locations shift towards the anchored leg . while in the zipping like asymmetric eruption , active leg moves along the neutral line and the hard x - ray sources move away from the anchored leg . in our present observations",
    ", the filament eruption is whipping - type highly asymmetric eruption , however , without any significant propagation of flare brightening towards its anchored leg .",
    "whipped filament also rises from nearby its southern activated footpoint , and energy deposition in the form of flare ribbons occurred only beneath of it .",
    "the asymmetric eruption of the filament later produced a slow cme that deflects the coronal ray in the outer corona .",
    "thereafter , the coronal downflow is observed from @xmath04.33 @xmath2 towards the sun .",
    "previously , wang & sheeley ( 2002 ) , observed the cme core fallback during 1998 - 2001 .",
    "they found that the fallback events occur in impulsive but relatively slow cmes .",
    "the fall down of core material may be due to its interaction with the background plasma which removes the momentum of the cme core .",
    "mckenzie & hudson ( 1999 ) observed a downward flow above the coronal arcades during the decay phase of solar flare on 1999 january 20 , and interpreted it as cross sections of evacuated flux - tubes resulting form the intermittent reconnection following the associated cme .",
    "however , in the present case , we have a moderate cme beyond 2 @xmath2 with its core , formed by highly asymmetric filament eruption that may start downflowing due to its self - consistent evolution in the coronal magnetic field as shown in our model calculations ( fig .",
    "11 ) .    in conclusion , our present multiwavelength study provides a unique relationship between the asymmetric filament eruption , flare as per standard model , associated cme , and the initiation of coronal downflows around @xmath04.33 @xmath2 .",
    "such studies may have important implications on the physical conditions of the outer corona and its coupling through various types of transients and plasma dynamics occurred in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "new observations should be performed using future high - resolution observations from space and ground to shed new light on such significant phenomena and their relationship in the solar atmosphere .",
