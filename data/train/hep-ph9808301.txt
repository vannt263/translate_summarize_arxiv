    "the announcement by the super - kamiokande collaboration@xcite of evidence for neutrino oscillation ( and hence nonzero neutrino mass ) in their atmospheric neutrino data is a major milestone in the search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "an outstanding feature of these oscillations is the maximal mixing between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) in sharp contrast with the mixing pattern in the quark sector . also the inferred @xmath4 ev@xmath5 is lower than most `` see - saw motivated '' extrapolations from @xmath6 values in the small or large angle msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem@xcite : @xmath7ev@xmath5 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ev@xmath5 with @xmath10 .",
    "the solar neutrino problem provided the first indication for neutrino oscillation and this evidence keeps building up .",
    "it can also be resolved by the maximal @xmath11 vacuum oscillation with fine tuned small mass difference @xmath12 ev@xmath5 .",
    "maximal mixing with larger @xmath13 values yield an energy independent suppression of all solar neutrinos ( except when it is in the large angle msw range mentioned above ) . while this does not resolve the solar neutrino problem at present , it does considerably ameliorate it .",
    "all the above suggests considering maximal ( @xmath11 ) mixing alongside maximal ( @xmath14 ) mixing@xcite .",
    "three specific `` bimaximal mixing '' patterns@xcite having particularly simple forms are :    _ case ( a)@xcite : _ @xmath15 where @xmath16 ; we will call this the symmetric mixing pattern .",
    "_ case ( b)@xcite : _",
    "@xmath17 this has been called in the literature as bimaximal mixing@xcite .    _ case ( c)@xcite : _ @xmath18",
    "we call this democratic mixing .    in the above equations ,",
    "we have defined @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the weak eigenstates and @xmath22 , the mass eigenstates .",
    "our goal is to explore possible extensions of the standard model that may provide a theoretical understanding of the maximal mixing patterns .",
    "attempts to understand the pattern ( a ) , made in our previous paper@xcite were largely unsuccessful . also the chooz upper bound@xcite on @xmath23 oscillation with @xmath24 ev@xmath5 , tends together with super - kamiokande data , to disfavor this possibility .",
    "there has been several recent attempts to derive the second pattern ( b)@xcite . here we will show by using an extension of the standard model , that it is possible to generate the pattern ( c ) in a consistent and natural way .",
    "our motivation is quite clear : if nature presents us with such a neutrino mixing pattern , we must seek an extension of the standard model that can naturally lead to it .",
    "hopefully a theory that naturally provides this pattern will have other testable predictions .    in ref.@xcite , permutation symmetry was imposed on the charged lepton mass matrix and not on the neutrino mass matrices in order to motivate the pattern ( c ) .",
    "no underlying theoretical justification was discussed for such a hypothesis . in the framework of gauge theories ,",
    "such an assumption is hard to understand apriori since the charged leptons and the neutrinos are members of the same isodoublet of the standard model gauge group @xmath25 and therefore the permutation symmetry could lead to a similar mass matrix for both the charged lepton sector as well as the neutrino sector . if that happens , the neutrino mixing matrix which is given by @xmath26 could substantially differ from ( c ) .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate whether the above mixing pattern arises in a complete theory .",
    "also the putative mass pattern @xmath27 should be provided by the model rather than arbitrarily fixed .",
    "it is considerations such as these which motivate us to add this brief note to the exploding literature on neutrino models .",
    "we find that by combining the permutation symmetry @xmath28 with a @xmath29 symmetry in the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model , we can obtain the maximal mixing pattern ( c ) in a technically natural manner ( i.e. without setting any parameters to zero by hand ) . in the limit of exact permutation symmetry , all the neutrinos are degenerate as are the elctron and the muon . as a result",
    ", the mixing angles can be rotated away . however , once one admits permutation breaking terms to accomodate the electron muon mass difference , the neutrino degeneracy is removed and the democratic form ( pattern c ) of the maximal mixing pattern remains .",
    "in fact , the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath0 get related to the elctron and muon masses arising completely from radiative corrections . to avoid arbitrary deviations from the maximal pattern , we assume that the permutation symmetry ( but not the @xmath29 ) is softly broken .",
    "this adds only small , finite , corrections to the mixing pattern and one obtains a complete and realistic gauge theoretic derivation of the maximal mixing pattern c.",
    "we consider a left - right symmetric extension of the standard model with the usual fermionic field content@xcite .",
    "we omit the discussion of the quark sector for now . denoting the leptons by @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath31 transform as the @xmath32 doublets respectively under the left - right gauge group @xmath33 .",
    "the subscript @xmath34 stands for the generations .",
    "we choose the following set of higgs bosons to achieve the symmetry breaking : three sets of left and right doublets dnoted by @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) ; the @xmath37 vev will break the @xmath38 gauge symmetry down to the standard model @xmath39 group .",
    "we choose three bidoublets @xmath40 to break the electroweak @xmath41 symmetry and give mass to the quarks and charged leptons as well as the dirac mass for the neutrinos . in order to implement the double seesaw@xcite mechanism for neutrino masses ,",
    "we introduce three gauge singlet fermion fields , @xmath42 .    in order to get the desired pattern for lepton masses , we demand the theory to respect the symmetry @xmath43 for all dimension four terms .",
    "we assume that all interactions of dimension four are invariant under permutation of the three indices @xmath36 for the fields that carry the subscript @xmath34@xcite .",
    "this symmetry will be softly broken by terms of dimension @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that under left - right symmetry @xmath45 and @xmath46 the transformation of the various fields under symmetry @xmath47 is given in table i. the quark fields are assumed to be singlets under the above groups .",
    "the yukawa couplings invariant under the above symmetries are : @xmath48 it is then clear that after the @xmath40 acquire vev s , they will give dirac mass to the charged leptons and the neutrinos . to get the desired pattern of charged lepton masses and the dirac mass for the neutrinos , we choose the vev pattern for the @xmath49 s as follows : @xmath50 . on the other hand , for the fields @xmath51 , we choose @xmath52 . due to left - right symmetry",
    ", one can assure that @xmath53 .",
    "it is crucial that the the vev pattern for @xmath51 is stable since this is what distinguishes the neutrino sector from the charged lepton sector and leads to the maximal mixing pattern ( c ) of democratic type for the neutrinos .",
    "it is important for this that there be no tadpole terms involving the @xmath54 components of the @xmath51 fields .",
    "this is verified by making the observation that all the @xmath55 have same @xmath56 quantum number ; as a result terms like @xmath57 which could generate the tadpoles are not present in the potential .",
    "the above vev pattern has the consequence that all elements of the charged lepton mass matrix are nonzero whereas the dirac mass matrix for the neutrinos is diagonal . to see the resulting mixing matrix ,",
    "let us write the charged lepton mass matrix : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "three eigen vectors of this mass matrix can be written as : @xmath61 where the particles in the above equation with superscript zero denote that they are the weak eigenstates prior to the diagonalization of the mass matrix .",
    "note that this matrix is precisely the matrix in eq .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are : @xmath62 it is then easy to see that if the majorana mass matrix for the neutrinos is diagonal , the consequent neutrino mixing matrix determined by the diagonalization of the charged lepton matrix above and is precisely of type ( c ) described above .",
    "note however that the muon and the electron masses are equal .",
    "in order for them to be much less than the @xmath63 mass as observed , we must have @xmath64 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if instead of @xmath28 symmetry , one assumes @xmath65 then indeed one ends up with @xmath66 as has been noted already@xcite .",
    "as alluded to before , we must have permutation symmetry breaking terms to split their masses . before proceeding to that discussion ,",
    "let us turn to the neutrino sector to make sure that no mixing angles emerge in the neutrino sector that could vitiate the maximal pattern .",
    "equation ( 3 ) and the @xmath67 vev pattern imply that the dirac mass matrix for the three neutrinos is diagonal with all @xmath68 given by @xmath69 . in order to understand the small neutrino masses",
    "we must implement a seesaw mechanism .",
    "it turns out that in this case the appropriate one for us is the double seesaw mechanism discussed in @xcite .",
    "from the terms involving the gauge singlet fermions @xmath42 s in the lagrangian : @xmath70 the @xmath71 mass matrix comes out to be @xmath72 with @xmath73 providing the largest mass scale in the problem .",
    "each of the entries in eq .",
    "( 7 ) except the @xmath74 is a @xmath75 unit matrix . in the limit of exact permutation symmetry",
    ", @xmath76 would also be a unit matrix .",
    "the light neutrino eigenvalues are given by : @xmath77 it is important to emphasize that there is no mixing in the purely neutrino sector so that in the basis where the charged leptons are diagonal , we have the desired maximal mixing pattern .",
    "this in our opinion is the big model building challenge that we have solved in this article .",
    "clearly , if permutation symmetry had not been broken by the different @xmath42 masses , the mixing matrix would have been arbitrary .",
    "to get a feeling for the scale of new physics @xmath78 , we note that @xmath79 gev . therefore ,",
    "assuming @xmath80 , we get @xmath81 gev ; and for @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 ev . if we choose @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 ev , which is in the range required to solve the atmospheric neutrino puzzle .    at this stage",
    "it might appear that the muon- and electron - neutrino masses can be chosen at will by adjusting the @xmath88 .",
    "but this is not so since the muon and electron masses which are tiny at the tree level ( if we choose @xmath66 ) must also arise out of the mass splitting among the @xmath42 s at the one loop level .",
    "the radiative contributions to the muon and electron masses arise from the diagram of type shown in fig.1 and we can estimate this contribution to be : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the typical heavy higgs boson mass that appears in the loop .",
    "we have also used the fact the vevs of @xmath91 satisfy the relation @xmath92 .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    choosing @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we estimate @xmath97 note that since we need to get the entire masses for the muon and the electron from the one loop correction , we must choose @xmath98 gev and @xmath99 gev .",
    "this then implies that @xmath100 ev and @xmath101 ev .",
    "we thus see that @xmath102 relevant for solving the solar neutrino problem is @xmath103 ev@xmath5 .",
    "this is comfortably in the right range for solving the solar neutrino problem using the large angle msw solution .",
    "let us now discuss the vev pattern assumed in the preceding analysis .",
    "two points need to be discussed are ( i ) the specific vev pattern for the field @xmath51 that differentiates the neutrino dirac mass from the charged lepton mass matrix and ( ii ) the induced @xmath104 vev .",
    "note that due to the nontrivial transformation of the @xmath105 field under the @xmath106 symmetry , the only allowed terms involving it in the potential are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "similar thing happens for @xmath110 .",
    "note further that the @xmath56 symmetry forbids terms like @xmath111 .",
    "the absence of terms of the form @xmath112 guarantees that once we choose the vev of the form @xmath113 , there are no tadpole like terms that can destabilize that vacuum . finally the fact that under left - right symmetry @xmath114 guarantees there is a discrete symmetry between these two fields leading to a stable minimum with @xmath53 .",
    "turning now to the second point , note that the potential involving the @xmath115 fields has the form @xmath116 where sum over @xmath34 has been omitted for simplicity . minimizing this",
    "we get that @xmath117 .",
    "a few comments about the model are in order .",
    "\\(i ) it is worth pointing out that in presence of the permutation symmetry breaking terms in the singlet fermion sector , there will be small deviations from the equality of the @xmath118 s and consequently of the scalar doublet masses .",
    "but these effects are small and they do not alter any of our conclusions .",
    "\\(ii ) the quark fields are assumed to be singlets under @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , their masses arise from the @xmath120 couplings only and thus are not constrained by the patterns in the lepton sector .",
    "\\(iii ) the lightest of the singlet fermions @xmath121 which couples to electrons can be produced at lep energies but has a cross section of order @xmath122 which at the highest lep energies is about @xmath123 cm@xmath5 and is thus practically invisible .",
    "in conclusion , we have succeeded in constructing a natural gauge model for the democratic maximal mixing for neutrinos suggested by the present neutrino data if lsnd results are not included .",
    "the models also predicts a small mass difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath0 as needed for the large angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that a gauge model for understanding the democratic lepton mass matrix in an extension of the standard model has been constructed .",
    "the model is essentially an electroweak scale model with low scale for the right handed @xmath125 s and uses the double seesaw mechanism to generate small neutrino masses .",
    "some of the new fermions of the model are light in the sense of collider physics .",
    "but their couplings to known particles are weak and thus there is no conflict with existing data ."
