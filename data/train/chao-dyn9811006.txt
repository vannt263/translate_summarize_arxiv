    "the standard kolmogorov @xmath6 scaling law for energy cascading in 3d turbulence and the corresponding @xmath7 scaling law for enstrophy cascade in 2d turbulence is still debated .",
    "direct numerical calculations of the full navier - stokes equation is by and large still impossible for high reynolds number @xmath8 flows .",
    "however , the cascading mechanisms and its multi fractal nature can be analyzed in reduced wave - number models for very high reynold numbers with high accuracy . in this paper",
    "we investigate the goy shell model @xcite where the spectral velocity or vorticity is represented by one complex variable for each shell evenly spaced in @xmath9 in spectral space . for this type of model",
    "the kolmogorov scaling arguments can be applied as for real flow regardless of how realistically they mimic the dynamics of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the scaling behavior of the fields depends on the inviscid invariants of the model . in the simple model we are able to control which symmetries and conserved integrals of the dynamics that are present in the inviscid and force - free limit . in the models we interpret as simulating 3d turbulence there are 2 inviscid invariants , similar to energy and helicity @xcite , of which the first is positive definite and the second is not . for the models we interpret as 2d turbulence the 2 inviscid invariants , similar to energy and enstrophy ,",
    "are both positive definite .",
    "we will mainly be concerned with an investigation of the 2d like models .",
    "the specific parameter choice previously assigned to simulating 2d turbulence are such that the goy model does not show enstrophy cascading but rather a statistical equilibrium where the enstrophy is transported through the inertial sub - range by diffusion @xcite .",
    "we show that this is a borderline case for which , on one side , the model behaves as a cascade model and , on the other side , it behaves as a statistical equilibrium model , where the enstrophy spectrum is characterized by a simple equipartitioning among the degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "the difference in behavior is connected with the different typical timescales of the shell velocities as function of shell number .",
    "this probabily also influences the ( non - universal ) multi fractal behavior of the shell velocities .",
    "if timescales in the viscous sub - range are not smaller than in the beginning of the inertial sub - range , the low wave - number end , the model does not have a multi fractal spectrum .",
    "the goy model is a simplified analogy to the spectral navier - stokes equation for turbulence .",
    "the spectral domain is represented as shells , each of which is defined by a wavenumber @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a scaling parameter defining the shell spacing ; in our calculations we use the standard value @xmath12 .",
    "the reduced phase space enables us to cover a large range of wavenumbers , corresponding to large reynolds numbers .",
    "we have @xmath13 degrees of freedom , where @xmath14 is the number of shells , namely the generalized complex shell velocities or vorticities , @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamical equation for the shell velocities is ,    @xmath17    where the first term represents the non - linear wave interaction or advection , the second term is the dissipation , the third term is a drag term , specific to the 2d case , and the fourth term is the forcing . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath18 . we will for convenience set @xmath19 , which can be done in ( [ dyn ] ) by a rescaling of time and the units in @xmath20 space .",
    "a real form of the goy model , as originally proposed by gledzer @xcite , can be obtained trivially by having purely imaginary velocities and forcing .",
    "the goy model in its original real form contains no information about phases between waves , thus there can not be assigned a flow field in real space to the spectral field .",
    "the complex form of the goy model and extensions in which there are more shell variables in each shell introduce some degrees of freedom , which could be thought of as representing the phases among waves .",
    "however , it seems as if these models do not behave differently from the real form of the model in regard to the conclusions in the following @xcite .",
    "the key issue for the behavior of the model is the symmetries and conservation laws obeyed by the model .",
    "the goy model has two conserved integrals , in the case of no forcing and no dissipation @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the two conserved integrals by    @xmath22    by setting @xmath23 and using @xmath24 from ( [ dyn ] ) we get    @xmath25 @xmath26 where the roots @xmath27 are the generators of the conserved integrals . in the case of negative values of @xmath28",
    "we can use the complex formulation , @xmath29 .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 are determined from ( [ bc ] ) as    @xmath31 @xmath32 in the @xmath33 parameter plane the curve @xmath34 represents models with only one conserved integral , see figure 1 . above the parabula the generators are complex conjugates , and below they are real and different .",
    "any conserved integral represented by a real nonzero generator @xmath28 defines a line in the @xmath30 parameter plane , which is tangent to the parabula in the point @xmath35 . the rest of our analysis we will focus on the line defined by @xmath36 . the conserved integral ,    @xmath37    is the usual definition of the energy for the goy model @xcite .",
    "the parameters are then determined by @xmath38 , which with the definitions @xmath39 and @xmath40 agree with the notation of ref .",
    "the generator of the other conserved integral is from ( [ 2 ] ) given as ,    @xmath41    for @xmath42 the second conserved integral is not positive definite and is of the form ,    @xmath43    which can be interpreted as a generalized helicity . for @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 the model is the usual 3d shell model and h is the helicity as defined in ref . @xcite . by choosing @xmath11 such that @xmath46 we get @xmath47 ) for the helicity .",
    "for @xmath48 the second conserved integral is positive definite and of the form ,    @xmath49    which can be interpreted as a generalized enstrophy . for @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 the model is the usual 2d shell model and z is the enstrophy as defined in ref .",
    "the sign of @xmath52 , which is the interaction coefficient for the smaller wavenumbers , changes when going from the 3d - to the 2d case .",
    "this could be related to the different role of backward cascading in the two cases . to see this , consider the non - linear transfer of @xmath53 through the triade interaction between shells , @xmath54 .",
    "this is simply given by ,    @xmath55    with    @xmath56    the detailed conservation of @xmath53 in the triade interaction is reflected in the identity , @xmath57 . using ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] ) we have for the exchange of energy , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 ;    @xmath60    and for helicity / enstrophy , @xmath61 , with @xmath62 ;    @xmath63    we have @xmath64 for 3d like models and @xmath65 for 2d like models , the two situations are depicted in figure 2 , where the thickness of the arrows symbolize the relative sizes of the exchanges in the cases of @xmath44 and @xmath50 .",
    "the inertial sub - range is defined as the range of shells where the forcing and the dissipation are negligible in comparison with the non - linear interactions among shells .",
    "since we apply the forcing at the small shell numbers and the dissipation at the large shell numbers , the inertial range ( of forward cascade ) is characterized by the constant cascade of one of the conserved quantities .",
    "the classical kolmogorov scaling analysis can then be applied to the inertial range .",
    "there is , however , in the shell model , long range influences of the dissipation and forcing into the inertial subrange .",
    "this is an artifact of the modulus 3 symmetry , see equation ( [ ggg ] ) , and the truncation of the shell model which is not expected to represent any reality .",
    "these features are treated in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . denoting @xmath66 as the average dissipation of @xmath67 ,",
    "this is then also the amount of @xmath67 cascaded through the inertial range .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath67 does then , by the kolmogorov hypothesis , only depend on @xmath20 and @xmath66 . from dimensional",
    "analysis we have , @xmath68=s^{-1}$ ] , @xmath69=[e^{1,2}]s^{-1}$ ] , @xmath70= [ k^{\\alpha_{1,2}}u^2]=[k]^{\\alpha -2}s^{-2}$ ] , and we get ,    @xmath71    for the generalized velocity , @xmath72 , we then get the `` kolmogorov- scaling '' ,    @xmath73    the non - linear cascade , or flux , of the conserved quantities defined by @xmath74 through shell number @xmath75 can be expressed directly as ,    @xmath76    in the inertial range the cascade is constant , @xmath77 , so from ( [ cascade1 ] ) we get following ref .",
    "@xcite    @xmath78    where we have defined    @xmath79    the inertial range scaling requires @xmath80 to be independent of @xmath75 . solving ( [ cascade3 ] ) for @xmath81 and using ( [ cascade2 ] ) gives ,    @xmath82    inserting this into ( [ cascade1 ] ) gives for the cascade of @xmath58 in the two solutions ,    @xmath83 @xmath84 and correspondingly for @xmath61 ,    @xmath85    these are the two scaling fixed points for the model .",
    "the kolmogorov fixed point for the first conserved integral corresponds to the fluxless fixed point for the other conserved integral and visa versa .",
    "this is of course reflected in the fact that ( [ cascade3 ] ) is symmetric in the indices 1 and 2 . that these points in phase space are fixed points , in the case of no forcing and dissipation , is trivial , since @xmath86 .",
    "it should be noted that the kolmogorov fixed point ,    @xmath87    obtained from this analysis is in agreement with the dimensional analysis ( [ k41 ] ) .",
    "the scaling fixed points can be obtained directly from the dynamical equation as well . for @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is any period 3 function , we get by inserting into ( [ dyn ] ) with @xmath90 ,    @xmath91    and the generators reemerge , @xmath92 , giving the kolmogorov fixed points for the two conserved integrals , @xmath93",
    ".    the period 3 symmetry seems to have little implications for the numerical integrations of the model , except perhaps in accurately determining the structure function .",
    "the stability of the fixed point for energy cascade in the 3d case , @xmath94 , is characterized by few unstable directions , where the corresponding eigenmodes mainly projects onto the high shell numbers , and a large number of marginally stable directions which mainly projects onto the inertial range .",
    "this also holds in the case with forcing and dissipation @xcite . in the case",
    "where dissipation and forcing are applied for some values of @xmath95 the kolmogorov fixed point can become stable .",
    "biferale et al .",
    "@xcite show that there is a transition in the goy model , for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , as a function of @xmath95 from stable fixed point @xmath98 , through hopf bifurcations and via a ruelle - takens scenario to chaotic dynamics @xmath99 .",
    "until this point we have not specified which of the two conserved quantities will cascade .",
    "assume , in the chaotic regime where the kolmogorov fixed points are unstable , that there is , on average , an input of the same size of the two quantities , @xmath58 and @xmath61 , at the forcing scale , this can of course always be done by a simple rescaling of one of the quantities . if @xmath100 is a shell number at the beginning of the viscous subrange , we have that @xmath101,and the dissipation , @xmath102 , of the conserved quantity , @xmath53 , can be estimated as    @xmath103    the ratio of dissipation of @xmath58 and @xmath61 scales with @xmath104 as @xmath105 , so that , in the limit @xmath106 when @xmath107 , there will be no dissipation in the viscous sub - range of @xmath58 where @xmath61 is dissipated .",
    "therefore , a forward cascade of @xmath58 is prohibited and we should expect a forward cascade of @xmath61 . for the backward cascade",
    "the situation is reversed , so we should expect a backward cascade of @xmath58 .",
    "the situation is completely different in the 2d like and the 3d like cases . in the 3d like models @xmath61 is not positive definite , @xmath61 ( helicity ) is generated also in the viscous sub - range and for the usual goy model we do not see a forward cascade of helicity , see , however , ref . @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed @xmath6 energy spectrum observed in real 3d turbulence corresponding to the forward cascade of energy . in the 2d case",
    "we observe the direct cascade of enstrophy , while the inverse cascade of energy is still debated . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will concentrate on 2d like models where we will implicitly think of @xmath108 , with @xmath59 , as the energy and @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , as the enstrophy . with regard to the inverse cascade of energy one",
    "must bare in mind that in 2d turbulence the dynamics involved is probably related to the generation of large scale coherent structures , vortices , and vortex interactions .",
    "vortices are localized spatially , thus delocalized in spectral space .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate that 2d is marginally delocalized in spectral space @xcite . in the goy model",
    "there is no spatial structure and the interactions are local in spectral space .",
    "the model is therefore probably not capable of showing a realistic inverse energy cascade .",
    "we will thus only consider the forward cascade in this paper .",
    "figure 3 shows the scaling in the inertial sub - range of the model with @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "the cascades of the enstrophy and energy are shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is seen that enstrophy is forward cascaded while energy is not .",
    "in a statistical equilibrium of an ergodic dynamical system we will have a probability distribution among the ( finite ) degrees of freedom , assuming an ultraviolet cutoff , of the form , @xmath112 , where @xmath58 and @xmath61 are the conserved quantitied , energy and enstrophy .",
    "thus , the temporal mean of any quantity , which is a function of the shell velocities is given as @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 are lagrange multipliers , reflecting the conservation of energy and enstrophy when maximizing the entropy of the system , corresponding to inverse temperatures , denoted as inverse `` energy- '' and `` enstrophy - temperatures '' @xcite .",
    "the shell velocities themselves will in this description be independent and gaussian distributed variables with standard deviation @xmath116 .",
    "the average values of the energy and enstrophy becomes ,    @xmath117    for @xmath118 we will have equipartitioning of energy , @xmath119 and the scaling @xmath120 and for the other branch , @xmath121 , we will have equipartitioning of enstrophy @xmath122 and the scaling @xmath123 . in the case of no forcing and no viscosity",
    "the equilibrium will depend on the ratio @xmath124 between the initial temperatures @xmath125 . to illustrate this we ran the model without forcing and viscosity but with 2 different initial spectral slopes of the velocity fields , the larger the slope the higher the ratio of the energy temperature to the enstrophy temperature .",
    "figure 5 shows the equilibrium spectra for @xmath126 , in the cases of initial slopes -1 , -0.8 .",
    "the full lines are the equilibrium distribution given by ( [ stat ] ) for @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "for the forward enstrophy cascade the spectral slope is @xmath129 and the enstrophy equipartitioning branch has spectral slope @xmath130 .",
    "thus for the 2d case where @xmath111 we can not distinguish between statistical ( quasi- ) equilibrium and cascading .",
    "this was pointed out by aurell et al . @xcite and it was argued that the model can be described as being in statistical quasi - equilibrium with the enstrophy transfer described as a simple diffusion rather than an enstrophy cascade . this coinciding scaling is a caviate of the goy model not present in the real 2d flow where the statistical equilibrium energy spectrum scales as @xmath131 and the cascade energy spectrum scales as @xmath7 . for other values of @xmath4",
    "the scaling of the two cases are different , see figure 6 .",
    "this figure represents the main message of this paper .",
    "first axis is the parameter @xmath95 , along the line shown in fig .",
    "1 , defining the spectral ratio between the two inviscid invariants .",
    "second axis is the scaling exponent @xmath132 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line @xmath133 is the kolmogorov scaling exponent for energy cascade .",
    "the full curve is the scaling exponent for the enstrophy cascade , and the dotted curve corresponds to the enstrophy equipartitioning .",
    "all the 3d like models ( asterisks in figure 6 ) are near energy cascade scaling ( dashed line ) .",
    "statistical equilibrium corresponds to the line @xmath134 . the bold line piece , @xmath135 , represents parameter values where the kolmogorov fixed point is stable @xcite .",
    "the scaling for @xmath136 is slightly steeper than the kolmogorov scaling , which is attributed to intermittency corrections originating from the viscous dissipation @xcite .",
    "it seems as if there is a slight trend showing increasing spectral slopes for increasing @xmath95 .    for the 2d like models",
    "the scaling slope is also everywhere on or slightly above both the cascade - and the equilibrium slopes ( diamonds in the figure ) .",
    "the classical argument for a cascade is that given an initial state with enstrophy concentrated at the low wave - number end of the spectrum , the enstrophy will flow into the high wave - numbers in order to establish statistical equilibrium .",
    "the ultra - violet catastrophe is then prevented by the dissipation in the viscous sub - range .",
    "therefore , we can not have a non - equilibrium distribution with more enstrophy in the high wave - number part of the spectrum than prescribed by statistical equilibrium since enstrophy in that case would flow from high - to low wave - numbers .",
    "this means that the spectral slope in the inertial sub - range always is above the slope corresponding to equilibrium ( dotted line in figure 6 ) .",
    "consequently , the 2d model with @xmath50 separates two regimes , @xmath137 where enstrophy equilibrium is achieved and @xmath138 where the enstrophy is cascaded through the inertial range .    in figure 7 the spectra and the cascades",
    "are shown for different values of @xmath95 .",
    "the model was run with 50 shells and forcing on shell number 15 for @xmath139 time units and averaged .",
    "even then there are large fluctuations in the cascades not reflected in the spectra .",
    "the large differences in the absolut values for the cascades , @xmath140 , is a reflection of the scaling relation ( [ diss ] ) .",
    "we interpret the peaks around the forcing scale for @xmath141 as statistical fluctuation and the model shows no cascade .",
    "for @xmath142 we see an enstrophy cascade and what seems to be an inverse energy cascade .",
    "however , we must stress that we do not see a second scaling regime for small @xmath75 corresponding the inverse cascade .",
    "note that for @xmath143 energy and enstrophy are identical and we have only one inviscid invariant .",
    "so if a regime of inverse energy cascading existed in parameter space near @xmath143 the scaling exponents will be almost identical and coincide at @xmath143 .",
    "the two regimes corresponding to equipartitioning and cascade can be understood in terms of timescales for the dynamics of the shell velocities .",
    "a rough estimate of the timescales for a given shell @xmath75 , is from ( [ dyn ] ) given as @xmath144 .",
    "again @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath145 , becomes marginal where the timescale is independent of shell number . for @xmath146",
    "the timescale grows with @xmath75 and the fast timescales for small @xmath75 can equilibrate enstrophy among the degrees of freedom of the system before the dissipation , at the `` slow '' shells , has time to be active .",
    "therefore these models exhibits statistical equilibrium . for @xmath142 the situation",
    "is reversed and the models exhibits enstrophy cascades .",
    "time evolutions of the shell velocities are shown in figure 8 , where the left columns show the evolution of a shell in the beginning of the inertial subrange and the right columns show the evolution of a shell at the end of the inertial subrange .",
    "this timescale scaling might also explain why no inverse cascade branch has been seen in the goy model .",
    "the timescales at the small wave - number end of the spectrum , with the dissipation or drag range for inverse cascade , is long in comparison with the timescales of the inertial range of inverse cascade .",
    "therefore a statistical equilibrium will have time to form .",
    "the analysis suggests that parameter choices @xmath147 might be more realistic than @xmath50 for mimicing enstrophy cascade in real 2d turbulence .",
    "the numerical result that the inertial range scaling has a slope slightly higher than the k 41 prediction , is not fully understood . this is attributed to intermittency corrections originating from the dissipation of enstrophy in the viscous subrange .",
    "the evolution of the shell velocities in the viscous sub - range is intermittent for @xmath142 , where the pdf s are non - gaussian , while the pdf s for @xmath50 are gaussian in both ends of the inertial sub - range , see figure 9 .",
    "the deviation from the kolmogorov scaling is expressed through the structure function , @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the structure function is defined through the scaling of the moments of the shell velocities ;    @xmath149    where @xmath150 is the deviation from kolmogorov scaling .",
    "the structure function , @xmath148 , and @xmath150 for @xmath151 are shown in figure 10 . for @xmath142",
    "there are intermittency corrections to the scaling in agreement with what the pdf s show .",
    "we know of no analytic way to predict the intermittency corrections from the dynamical equation .",
    "our numerical calculations suggest that the intermittency corrections are connected with the differences in typical timescales from the beginning of the inertial sub - range , where the model is forced , to the viscous sub - range .",
    "the ratio of timescales between the dissipation scale and the forcing scale can be estimated by ; @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the number of shells beween the two .",
    "figure 11 ( a ) shows the numerical values of @xmath154 as a function of @xmath95 and figure 11 ( b ) shows @xmath155 as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "the vertical line indicates the crossover between statistical equilibrium and cascading . we must stress that caution should be taken upon drawing conclusions from this since the authors have no physical explanation of the appearent relationship",
    "the goy shell model has two inviscid invariants , which govern the behavior of the model . in the 2d like case",
    "these corresponds to the energy and the enstrophy of 2d turbulent flow . in the model",
    "we can change the interaction coefficient , @xmath95 , and tune the spectral ratio of enstrophy to energy , @xmath156 .",
    "for @xmath157 we can describe the dynamics as being in statistical equilibrium with two scaling regimes corresponding to equipartitioning of energy and enstrophy respectively .",
    "the reason for the equipartitioning of enstrophy in the inertial range ( of forward cascading of enstrophy ) is that the typical timescales , corresponding to eddy turnover times , are growing with shell number , thus the timescale of viscous dissipation is large in comparison with the timescales of non - linear transfer .",
    "thus , this choice of interaction coefficient is completely unrealistic for mimicing cascades in 2d turbulence . for @xmath158",
    "the model shows forward cascading of enstrophy , but we have not identified a backward cascade of energy . the usual choice @xmath50",
    ", @xmath111 is a borderline and we suggest that @xmath158 in respect to mimicing enstrophy cascade might be more realistic .",
    "we observe that the dynamics becomes more intermittent when @xmath158 , in the sense that the structure function deviates more and more from the kolmogorov prediction . for @xmath143",
    "we have @xmath159 , thus energy and enstrophy degenerates into only one inviscid invariant , this point could then be interpreted as a model of 3d turbulence . however , as is seen from ( [ pi1 ] ) , in this case the fluxless fixed point is the one surviving , but as is seen in figure 7 , bottom panels , this model also shows cascading .",
    "this choice for 3d turbulence model could shed some light on the dispute of the second inviscid invariant ( helicity ) being important @xcite or not @xcite for the deviations from kolmogorov theory , work is in progress on this point .",
