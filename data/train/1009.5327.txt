    "we study in this paper the asymptotic behavior of the steady - state waiting time distribution of an m / g/1 queue with subexponential service time distribution and first - in - first - out ( fifo ) discipline .",
    "the goal is to provide expressions that will allow us to identify the different types of asymptotic behavior that the queue experiences depending on different combinations of traffic intensity and overflow levels .",
    "we give our results for the special case of an m / g/1 queue with the idea that the insights that we obtain are applicable to more general queues and even to networks of queues .",
    "the special case of an m / g/1 queue with regularly varying processing times was previously analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that the behavior of @xmath2 , the steady - state waiting time distribution , can be fully described by the so - called heavy traffic approximation and heavy tail asymptotic ( see theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out in that work , the same type of results can be derived for a larger subclass of the subexponential family , in particular , for service time distributions whose tails decay slower than @xmath1 . as the main results of this paper show ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 for lighter subexponential service time distributions may include a third region where neither the heavy traffic approximation nor the heavy tail asympotic are valid , and where the higher order moments of the service time distribution start playing a role .",
    "the exact way in which these higher order moments appear in the distribution of @xmath0 is closely related to the large deviations behavior of an associated random walk and its corresponding cramr series .",
    "the approach that we take to understand the asymptotics of @xmath2 over the entire line is to provide approximations that hold uniformly across all values of the traffic intensity for large values of the tail , or alternatively , uniformly across all tail values for traffic intensities close to one . from such uniform approximations",
    "it is possible to compute the exact thresholds separating the different regions of deviations of @xmath0 , which for service time distributions decaying slower than @xmath1 are simply the heavy traffic and heavy tail regions , and , for lighter subexponential distributions , include a third region where neither the heavy traffic approximation nor the heavy tail asymptotic hold .",
    "similar uniform approximations have been derived in the literature for the tail distribution of a random walk with subexponential increments in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where the uniformity is on the number of summands for large values of the tail or across all tail values as the number of summands grows to infinity .",
    "the results in the paper are in some sense the equivalent for the single - server queue .",
    "to explain the idea behind our main results let us recall that one can approximate the tail distribution of the steady - state waiting time of a single - server queue with subexponential processing times , @xmath2 , via two well known approximations : the heavy traffic approximation and the heavy tail asymptotic @xmath3 respectively , where @xmath4 denotes the service time , @xmath5 the inter - arrival time , and @xmath6 the traffic intensity of the queue .",
    "we refer the reader to chapter x of @xcite and the references therein for more details on the history and the exact formulation of these limit theorems .",
    "the heavy traffic approximation is valid for the general gi / gi/1 queue and can be derived by using a functional central limit theorem type of analysis ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the theorem that justifies this approximation is obtained by taking the limit as the traffic intensity approaches one and is applicable for bounded values of @xmath7 .",
    "the heavy tail asymptotic is valid for the gi / gi/1 fifo queue with subexponential service time distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and is obtained by taking the limit as @xmath7 goes to infinity for a fixed traffic intensity , that is , it is applicable for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "one can then think of combining these two approximations to obtain an expression that is uniformly valid on the entire positive axis .    the approach we take in the derivation of the main theorems is to start with the pollaczek - khintchine formula for the distribution of the steady - state waiting time of the m / g/1 queue , which expresses it as a geometric random sum , and use the asymptotics for the tail distribution of the random walk .",
    "one of the difficulties in obtaining uniform asymptotics for the distribution of @xmath0 lies in the highly complex asymptotic behavior of the random walk .",
    "surprisingly , most of the cumbersome details of the asymptotics for the random walk disappear in the queue , but showing that this is indeed the case requires a considerable amount of work .",
    "the qualitative difference between queues with service time distributions with tails decaying slower than @xmath1 and their lighter - tailed counterparts comes from the asymptotic behavior of the random walk associated to the geometric random sum . the function @xmath1 has been identified as a threshold in the behavior of heavy tailed sums and queues in @xcite , and @xcite , respectively , to name a few references , and we provide here yet another example .    as mentioned before",
    ", the approximations we provide can be used to derive the exact regions where the heavy traffic and heavy tail approximations hold , but we do not provide the details in this paper since our focus is on deriving uniform expressions for @xmath2 under minimal conditions on the service time distribution .",
    "the setting we consider is the same from @xcite where the busy period was analyzed .",
    "more detailed comments about the third region of asymptotics that arises when the service time distribution is lighter than @xmath1 can be found in remark [ r.mainremarks ] right after theorem [ t.main ] . for clarity , we state all our assumptions and notation in the following section , and our main results in section [ s.mainresults ] .",
    "finally , we mention that the expressions given in the main theorems can be of practical use as numerical approximations for @xmath2 , and based on simulation experiments done for service times with a pareto ( @xmath8 ) or weibull ( @xmath9 ) distribution , they seem to perform very well ( see section 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the uniform approximations given here are far superior than the heavy traffic or heavy tail approximations individually even in the regions where these are valid , which is to be expected since they are based on the entire pollaczek - khintchine formula ; they are also easy to compute given the integrated tail distribution of the processing times and its first few moments ( cumulants ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the waiting time sequence for an m / g/1 fifo queue that is fed by a poisson arrival process having arrival rate @xmath11 and independent iid processing times @xmath12 .",
    "provided that the traffic intensity @xmath6 is smaller than one , we denote by @xmath13 the steady - state waiting time of the queue .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is such that its integrated tail distribution , given by @xmath15 is subexponential , where @xmath16 . the sequence @xmath17 will denote iid random variables having distribution @xmath18 .    define @xmath19 to be the cumulative hazard function of @xmath18 and let @xmath20 be its hazard rate function ; note that @xmath21 is the density of @xmath22 .",
    "just as in @xcite and @xcite , we define the hazard rate index @xmath23    all the results presented in this paper hold for subexponential distributions @xmath24 ( its corresponding integrated tail distribution @xmath18 ) satisfying the following assumption .",

    "@xmath26 , where @xmath27    assumption [ a.hazard ] is consistent with conditions b and c in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and also very closely related to definition 1 in @xcite .",
    "all three of these works study the asymptotic behavior of random sums with subexponential increments applied to either the study of the busy period of a gi / gi/1 queue or to ruin probabilities in insurance . also , by proposition 3.7 in @xcite , assumption [ a.hazard ] ( a. ) is equivalent to the function @xmath28 being decreasing on @xmath29 for any @xmath30 , which is the same as equation ( 3 ) in @xcite , where uniform asymptotics for the tail behavior of a random walk with subexponential increments were derived . as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , lemma  3.6 in @xcite implies that @xmath31 < \\infty\\ } \\geq \\liminf_{t \\to \\infty } t q(t)$ ] , so assumption  [ a.hazard ] ( b. ) guarantees that @xmath32 < \\infty$ ] for all @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , assumption [ a.hazard ] ( b. ) and lemma 3.6 in @xcite together imply that @xmath34 , which in turn implies that for some @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37    although the tail distribution of the busy period in queues with heavy tailed service times is related to that of its waiting time in the sense that it is determined by @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) , the approach to its analysis is rather different from that of the waiting time , so the only connection between the results in this paper and those cited above is the setting .",
    "this family of distributions includes in particular all regularly varying distributions , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and all semiexponential distributions , @xmath41 with @xmath42 ; in these definitions @xmath43 is a slowly varying function .",
    "the regularly varying case with @xmath44 was covered in detail in @xcite .",
    "some subexponential distributions that do not satisfy assumption [ a.hazard ] are those decaying  almost \" exponentially fast , e.g. @xmath45 .    before stating our main results in the following section , we introduce some more notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 . also , define @xmath48 and note that by proposition 3.7 in @xcite , @xmath28 is eventually decreasing for all @xmath49 , which implies that @xmath50 for all @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath51 this implies that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "also , we obtain the relation @xmath54 , or equivalently , @xmath55 . combining this observation with our previous remark about assumption [ a.hazard ] ( b. )",
    "gives that for @xmath56 and any @xmath57 we have @xmath58 < \\infty$ ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the idea of this paper is to use the pollaczek - khintchine formula to write the distribution of the steady - state waiting time as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a sequence of iid random variables having distribution @xmath18 , and then approximate @xmath62 by an appropriate asymptotic expression .",
    "the approximation that we use for @xmath62 depends on the pair @xmath63 , and for the heavy - tailed setting that we consider here , one can identify four different regions of deviations .",
    "the first region is the one described by the central limit theorem ( clt ) , i.e. , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the standard normal distribution function .",
    "the second region is the so - called cramr region , which provides additional correction terms to the clt approximation .",
    "when the distribution @xmath18 has finite exponential moments , the cramr approximation is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a power series with coefficients depending on the cumulants of @xmath68 known in the literature as the cramr series ( see @xcite , chapter viii ,  2 , or @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath18 is heavy - tailed , nevertheless , @xmath69 diverges for all @xmath70 and a truncated form of this series replaces @xmath71 . in the setting of this paper , only the terms up to @xmath72 ( as defined by ) are needed , and we obtain the following approximation for @xmath62 @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the coefficients of the cramr series corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "note that if @xmath53 , then approximations and are the same .",
    "the third region is known in the literature as the  intermediate domain \" , and the exact asymptotics for @xmath62 in this region can be considerably complicated ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "fortunately , the range of values corresponding to this region in the pollaczek - khintchine formula is negligible with respect to the rest , and we will only need to use an upper bound for @xmath62 .",
    "the fourth and last region is the heavy - tailed region , also know as the  big jump domain \" ( see @xcite and @xcite , for example ) , where @xmath78    in the discussion above we purposefully omitted describing the boundaries between the four different regions , since that alone requires introducing various ( complicated ) functions and their corresponding asymptotic behavior . in terms of the pollaczek - khintchine formula , it is enough to consider simpler versions of those thresholds .",
    "we start by defining the functions @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , and let @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "we give below some properties of the @xmath84 operator ; the proof is omitted but can be derived through straightforward analysis .",
    "[ l.rightinverse ] for any continuous function @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , define the function @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "then , the following are true    1 .",

    "@xmath84 is a right inverse of @xmath89 , that is , @xmath90 , for all @xmath91 .",
