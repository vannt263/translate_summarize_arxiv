    "there exist several approaches in the study of chaotic behavior of dynamical systems using the concepts such as entropy , complexity , chaos , fractal , stochasticity @xcite . in 1991 , one of the authors",
    "proposed information dynamics ( i d for short ) @xcite to treat such chaotic behavior of systems altogether .",
    "i d is a synthesis of the dynamics of state change and the complexity of systems , and it is applied to several different fields such as quantum physics , fractal theory , quantum information and genetics@xcite .",
    "a quantity measuring chaos in dynamical systems was defined by means of two complexities in i d , and it is called chaos degree . in particular , among several chaos degrees , an entropic chaos degree was introduced in @xcite , and is applied to logistic map to study its chaotic behavior .",
    "this chaos degree has several merits compared with usual measures of chaos such as lyapunov exponent .    in section2 , we review the complexity in i d and the chaos degree ( cd for short ) . in section 3 , we remind the entropic chaos degree and the lyapunov exponent ( le for short ) . in section 4 , the algorithm computing the entropic chaos degree is shown . in section 5 ,",
    "we compute cd and le for bernoulli shift , baker s transformation and tinkerbell s map , then we discuss the merits of the entropic chaos degree .",

    "once an input and an output systems are set , the situation of the input system is described by a state , an element of @xmath3 @xmath17 and the change of the state is expressed by a mapping from @xmath3 to @xmath18 , called a channel .",
