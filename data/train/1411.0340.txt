    "itinerant ferromagnetism ( fm ) is one of the central topics of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it has also become a research focus both experimental and theoretical of ultra - cold atom physics @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of itinerant fm has been a long - standing problem .",
    "stoner proposed the exchange interaction among electrons with parallel spins as the driving force for itinerant fm @xcite . along this direction ,",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) of the density functional theory has achieved great success @xcite .",
    "for example , the ground state magnetic moments of fm metals can be calculated accurately @xcite .",
    "the implementation of correlation effects in lda has also been improved by the methods of lda+u @xcite , lda+dmft(dynamical mean - field theory ) @xcite , and lda+gp ( gutzwiller projection ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , itinerant fm systems are also strongly correlated , and their physics is often non - perturbative .",
    "usually repulsive interactions need to be sufficiently strong to overcome the kinetic energy cost of polarizing electron spins , and thus itinerant fm has no well - controlled weak - coupling starting point .",
    "the stoner criterion overlooks correlation effects among electrons with opposite spins @xcite : electrons can delicately organize their wavefunctions to reduce repulsions and still remain unpolarized even in the presence of strong interactions .",
    "for example , the lieb - mattis theorem proves that the ground state of a rigorously one - dimensional ( 1d ) system is a spin singlet no matter how strong the interaction is @xcite .",
    "it is more appropriate to start with electron orbitals to construct lattice model hamiltonians to address the strong correlation aspect of itinerant fm .",
    "exact theorems establishing fm , which are usually based on lattice models , are indispensable to provide reference points for further investigations .",
    "well - known examples include the nagaoka theorem @xcite , which applies to the infinite @xmath2 hubbard models in two and above dimensions with doping a single hole on the half - filled background , and the `` flat - band '' fm in certain lattices with dispersionless band structures @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "fm arises because the spin polarized background maximally facilitates the hole s",
    "coherent hopping , while in the latter case , the band flatness reduces the kinetic energy cost for polarizing spin to zero .",
    "one central issue of itinerant fm is the role of orbital degeneracy which widely exists in fm metals .",
    "hund s coupling is a prominent feature in multi - orbital systems , which favors electrons on the same site to align their spins .",
    "however , hund s coupling is local physics which usually can not polarize itinerant electrons in the absence of local moments . under",
    "what precise conditions hund s coupling can lead to the global fm coherence in itinerant systems is still an open question .",
    "the difficulty in achieving unambiguous fm ground states is only one side of the story of strongly - correlated itinerant fm , the finite - temperature thermodynamic properties are another challenge @xcite . at first looking , it might not look so striking : the ferromagnetic susceptibilities show the standard mean - field curie - weiss ( cw ) law in the off - critical region as ( t)= , [ eq : curie ] where @xmath3 is the curie constant @xcite and @xmath4 is the curie temperature at the mean - field level .",
    "the cw law manifests spin incoherence , which is common in the paramagnetic state based on local moments .",
    "but it is difficult to understand in itinerant fm metals still possessing fermi surfaces .",
    "for example , the transport and the charge channel properties , such as resistance and compressibility , remain metallic , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are featured by the fermi surface physics . within the itinerant picture , the pauli magnetic susceptibility augmented by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) yields @xmath5 , but it is not commonly observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cw law in fm metals applies to a wide range of temperatures @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the fermi temperature ) which shows spin - incoherence well below @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is that rpa treats the paramagnetic phase as a weakly correlated fermi liquid state with slightly thermally broadened fermi distributions .",
    "actually , this phase is rather complicated : dynamic fm domains strongly fluctuate , which is beyond the rpa description and is difficult to handle analytically .",
    "the paramagnetic state of itinerant fm exhibits much higher entropy capacity than the usual weakly correlated paramagnetic fermi liquid state , which significantly suppresses the genuine curie temperature @xmath8 , or , the renormalized one , away from the mean - field value @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , @xmath8 is often significantly overestimated by weak coupling approaches @xcite .",
    "a key question is how itinerant systems can exhibit the cw law and further develop fm purely based on itinerant electrons without involving local moments such that the charge channel remains coherent ?",
    "significant efforts have been made , including the self - consistent renormalization theory including spin mode coupling @xcite , the direct exchange from the coulomb integral @xcite , spin incoherence due to hund s coupling @xcite , and the orbital - selective mott transition @xcite .",
    "an important progress is that the cw law can be obtained from the combined method of lda+dmft @xcite away from the critical region .",
    "however , none of these methods are non - perturbative in nature .",
    "another issue is the nature of the fm phase transitions in fm metals , which has been been widely studied but is still under intensive debates @xcite .",
    "compared to the superconducting phase transitions in which the fermion degree of freedom is gapped below transition temperatures , the fm phase transitions are more involved because systems remain gapless across transitions due to the existence of fermi surfaces .",
    "the fm domain fluctuations combined with the landau damping of particle - hole excitations around fermi surfaces complicates fm transitions .",
    "it would be important to perform a non - perturbative study .",
    "recently , the ground states of a multi - orbital hubbard model have been proved fully spin polarized in the strong coupling regime in the 2d square and 3d cubic lattices @xcite by two of the authors and lieb .",
    "it is showed that inter - orbital hund s coupling combined with electron itinerancy in the quasi-1d band structure drive the fm ground states .",
    "compared to the nagaoka fm , this new theorem proves a stable fm phase with nodeless ground state wavefunctions over the entire electron density region @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the occupation number per site , thus it sets up a solid starting point for further studying the strong correlation aspect of itinerant fm .",
    "it also opens up the possibility of performing sign - problem free quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations away from half - filling by employing the bases under which the many - body hamiltonians satisfy the perron - frobenius condition .",
    "although this theorem only sets up the ground state properties , it establishes an unambiguous fm phase as a starting point for further studying both thermodynamic properties and magnetic phase transitions over a wide region of electron density . in order to handle the strong magnetic fluctuations",
    ", qmc simulations would be the ideal method , however , they usually suffer the notorious sign problem for fermions and thus are generally speaking inapplicable for itinerant fm .",
    "remarkably , we prove that for the systems in which the ground state fm theorem mentioned above @xcite applies , the fermion sign problem can be eliminated in the entire electron density region .",
    "this provides a new opportunity to study the finite temperature thermodynamic properties and magnetic phase transitions in an asymptotically exact way .    for later convenience ,",
    "we briefly discuss the fm critical fluctuations which are particularly important in two - dimensions . according to the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm of critical phenomena ,",
    "@xmath8 is suppressed from @xmath4 but remains finite in 3d .",
    "as @xmath11 is lowered from @xmath4 and approaches @xmath8 , the system crosses over from the mean - field region to the critical region , and @xmath12 due to non - gaussian fluctuations and @xmath13 is the critical exponent . in 2d , @xmath8 remains finite if the system symmetry is reduced to the ising class , or , the easy axis class .",
    "however , for the isotropic class , thermal fluctuations suppress @xmath8 to zero according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case the mean - field @xmath4 is still an important temperature scale below which the fm order develops its magnitude .",
    "however , the orientation fluctuations of the fm order suppress the long - rang - order .",
    "in other words , this region is characterized by fluctuating fm domains and the correlation length increases exponentially as lowering temperatures .",
    "consequently , the fm susceptibility deviates from the cw law and crosses over into an exponential growth .    in this article",
    ", we will present a systematic non - perturbative study on thermodynamic properties and magnetic phase transitions of itinerant fm by performing the sign - problem free qmc simulations .",
    "our results show that itinerant fm can indeed exhibit both spin incoherence and charge coherence simultaneously without forming local moments .",
    "in other words , the system exhibits the feature of the cw metal as a combined effect of hund s coupling and electron itinerancy .",
    "the model we simulate can be realized in both @xmath0-orbital transition metal oxide layer and @xmath1-orbital ultra - cold atom optical lattices , which do not contain local moments as a priori .",
    "the spin magnetic susceptibility exhibits the cw law as a signature of spin incoherence , while , the compressibility weakly depends on temperature as a consequence of itinerancy .",
    "the mean - field curie temperature @xmath4 is extracted based on the cw law in the off - critical region , which is much lower than the temperature scale of charge coherence @xmath14 .",
    "the filling dependence of @xmath4 is calculated and the maximal @xmath4 reaches one tenth of the hopping integral .",
    "the fermi distribution functions in momentum space are calculated in the strongly correlated paramagnetic phase .",
    "the fermion occupation numbers are strongly suppressed from the saturated value even for wavevectors close to the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "when entering the critical region , for the su(2 ) symmetric models , @xmath15 grows exponentially .",
    "the true fm long range order is achieved by reducing the model symmetry to the ising class and the fm critical temperature @xmath8 is determined accurately by the finite size and critical scaling .",

    "we consider the case of the 2d square lattice : on each site there are two orthogonal orbitals forming a quasi-1d band structure . for simplicity ,",

    "thus different from the usual case that hund s coupling can only polarize electrons on the same site .",
    "remarkably , in this case it does polarize electrons in the entire system @xcite .",
