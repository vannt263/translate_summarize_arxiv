    "observational studies of galaxy formation and evolution have progressed at a breathtaking pace over the past couple of years .",
    "data from the refurbished hubble space telescope , the keck and other large telescopes are now providing quantitative information on essential properties of the galaxy population  number densities , luminosities , colours , morphologies and star formation rates  over a large span of cosmic time .",
    "these data are beginning to sketch out an empirical picture of galaxy formation and evolution from redshift @xmath7 to the present .",
    "evolution has now been established and quantified in : _",
    "( i ) _ the neutral hydrogen and metal content of the universe since @xmath7 ( lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek 1995 , storrie - lombardi 1996 , wolfe 1995 , lu 1996 ) ; _ ( ii ) _ the galaxy luminosity function since @xmath8 ( lilly 1995 ; ellis 1996 ) ; _ ( iii ) _ the morphology of field and cluster galaxies since @xmath9 ( e.g. abraham 1996 , dressler 1994 , smail 1997 ) .",
    "the most recent addition to this remarkable list of observational advances is the discovery of a large population of _ actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 _",
    ", identified by their redshifted lyman continuum breaks ( steidel 1996a , hereafter s96 ) .",
    "it is this population that we are primarily concerned with in this paper .",
    "one of the earliest windows on the physical processes at play in galaxy formation is provided by studies of primordial gas clouds detected in absorption against background quasars .",
    "the comoving density of neutral hydrogen present in damped lyman - alpha clouds peaks at @xmath0 when it was comparable to the mass in baryons seen in galactic disks today ( storrie - lombardi 1996 ) .",
    "the decline in the abundance of neutral hydrogen clouds seems to be accompanied by a gradual build - up of their metal content ( lu 1996 ) .",
    "a population of bright galaxies is certainly well established by @xmath10 ( lilly 1995 , ellis 1996 , kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ) . in the cfrs survey of lilly ,",
    "evolution is manifest in a systematic variation of the shape of the luminosity function of blue galaxies and a brightening of their characteristic luminosity with increasing lookback time .",
    "the luminosity function of red galaxies , on the other hand , seems to have changed little over this redshift interval , although the fraction of galaxies that have the colours of passively evolving ellipticals appears to fall to one third of its present day value by @xmath10 ( kauffmann 1996 ) .    on the whole",
    ", galaxies appear to be smaller and increasingly irregular at higher redshift ( driver 1995 , glazebrook 1995a , abraham 1996 , smail 1996 , odewahn 1996 , pascarelle 1996 , lowenthal 1997 . ) for example , the class of `` irregular / merger '' galaxies which are relatively rare at bright magnitudes makes up about a third to a half of all galaxies with @xmath11 .",
    "the median redshift at this apparent magnitude ( the faintest at which automated morphological classification is possible on high resolution hst images ) is @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the fraction of spirals in rich clusters at @xmath12 is higher than in present day clusters ( dressler 1994 ) .",
    "all these studies leave little doubt that the galaxy population has evolved significantly since @xmath10 .",
    "the discovery of a large population of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath13 provides the first opportunity for statistical studies of evolutionary processes in galaxies beyond @xmath10 .",
    "steidel and collaborators ( steidel & hamilton 1992 , 1993 ; steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; s96 ) searched for high redshift galaxies by selecting objects in a colour - colour plane constructed from images in customised @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 band filters .",
    "for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath17 , the lyman limit discontinuity passes through the @xmath14 filter .",
    "opacity due to intervening neutral hydrogen increases the strength of the lyman discontinuity regardless of the shape of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the galaxy ( madau 1995 ) .",
    "thus , a galaxy in this redshift range will be faint in the @xmath14 band ( thus becoming a `` uv - dropout '' ) and so will have a very red @xmath18 colour , whilst possibly having a blue @xmath19 colour if it is undergoing significant star formation .",
    "a similar strategy has been successfully implemented in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) by steidel ( 1996b ) and madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "the hst @xmath20 filter has a shorter median wavelength than the @xmath14 filter of the ground - based observations , and so colour selected objects in the hdf span a wider range of redshifts from @xmath21 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of the uv drop - out candidates by s96 on the keck telecope confirmed that these galaxies lie mostly in the expected redshift range , @xmath22 .",
    "their spectra resemble those of nearby starburst galaxies . from the apparent @xmath16-band magnitude , a dust - free model for the spectral energy distribution in the uv , and an assumption about the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , s96 inferred star formation rates in these galaxies in the range @xmath23 for a critical density universe , where we have expressed hubble s constant as @xmath24 .",
    "similarly low star formation rates have been inferred by lowenthal ( 1997 ) for 11 galaxies in the hdf at @xmath25 . from the width of saturated interstellar absorption lines ,",
    "s96 inferred tentative one - dimensional velocity dispersions in the range @xmath26 .",
    "they concluded that the lyman - break galaxies they discovered could be the progenitors of the spheroidal components of present day galaxies .",
    "the current state of empirical knowledge on galaxy formation has been nicely summarized by madau ( 1996 ) and madau ( 1996 ) in the form of a `` cosmic star formation history . '' combining a variety of surveys ( including the cfrs and the lyman - break galaxy surveys ) , they derived metal production and star formation rates as a function of redshift , from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "observed star formation rates over this redshift range are typically a few solar masses per year for individual galaxies .",
    "the integrated star formation rate never differs by more than an order of magnitude over this entire redshift range , although a peak of activity seems to have occured at @xmath29 .",
    "the total amount of metals produced by the observed populations is comparable to the amount of metals seen in massive galaxies today , suggesting that the bulk of the cosmic star formation has now been identified .    in this paper",
    "we employ the semi - analytic model developed in a series of earlier papers ( cole 1994 ; heyl 1995 ; baugh 1996a , 1996b ) , to investigate the significance of the lyman - break galaxy population within the context of hierarchical clustering theories of galaxy formation .",
    "we consider the circumstances under which such a population may form and we focus on the connection between these high redshift objects and galaxies seen in various evolutionary stages at lower redshifts .",
    "we use the available data to test in detail our earlier theoretical predictions for the way in which galaxies are built up from small fluctuations in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) . specifically , we test the prediction of white & frenk ( 1991 ) , lacey ( 1993 ) and cole ( 1994 ) that the bulk of the stars present in galaxies today formed relatively recently , with a median redshift of star formation of only @xmath30 .",
    "the results of these comparisons are very encouraging and suggest a general picture of galaxy formation and evolution which is consistent with the expectations from a broad class of hierarchical clustering cosmologies .    a more basic attempt to investigate whether the abundance of s96 lyman - break galaxies is consistent with cold dark matter models was recently carried out by mo & fukugita ( 1996 ) .",
    "they used the press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism to calculate the number density of halos with velocity dispersion in excess of @xmath31 , making simple assumptions about the time required for a galaxy to form in each halo .",
    "they concluded that a range of low - density cobe - normalized cdm models are compatible with the data .",
    "our semi - analytic galaxy formation scheme is briefly reviewed in section  [ s : method1 ] , where we discuss our procedure for generating mock catalogues of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the colour selection criteria of s96 are reviewed in section  [ s : col ] and the abundance of galaxies that meet these constraints in a variety of cosmological models is given in section  [ s : abun ] .",
    "the expected properties of high redshift galaxies  masses , star formation rates , sizes , clustering , etc  are presented in section  [ s : prop ] .",
    "our models predict the entire evolutionary history of galaxies and so , in section  [ s : fate ] , we illustrate the eventual fate of a few high redshift examples and examine the statistical properties of the descendants of the lyman - break objects . in section  [",
    "s : epoch ] , we recast the cole ( 1994 ) predictions for the cosmic star formation history in a manner that is directly comparable to the madau ( 1996 ) data , and we also compare our predicted evolution in the neutral gas fraction with observations",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "semi - analytic modelling is a novel technique for calculating _",
    "ab initio _ the evolutionary properties of galaxies in cosmological models in which structure forms hierarchically .",
    "the growth of dark matter halos by accretion and mergers is followed statistically , while physically motivated rules are used to describe the cooling of gas in these halos , the transformation of cold gas into stars , and the effects of feedback from massive stars on the dynamics of the gas .",
    "the spectrophotometric properties of the stars that form are calculated from a spectral synthesis model .",
    "the basic physical concepts , mathematical formalisms , and first applications of semi - analytic modelling are presented in white & rees ( 1978 ) , cole ( 1991 ) , lacey & silk ( 1991 ) , white & frenk ( 1991 ) , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni ( 1993 ) , and cole _",
    "the technique has now been successfully applied to a variety of problems in galaxy formation ( lacey 1993 ; kauffmann , guiderdoni & white 1994 ; heyl 1995 ; kauffmann 1995 , 1996a , b and baugh 1996a , b , frenk 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the basic rules that govern the physical processes in the galaxy formation scheme adopted in this paper are presented in detail in cole _",
    "( 1994 ) . in brief , when a dark matter halo collapses , its associated gas is assumed to be shock - heated and to settle into quasistatic equilibrium at the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "this gas cools radiatively over the lifetime of the halo and cold gas is turned into stars at a rate proportional to the instantaneous cold gas mass .",
    "feedback from supernovae and stellar winds returns some of the cold gas to the hot phase , strongly inhibiting star formation in low circular velocity halos . during a merger ,",
    "the dark matter halos coalesce , but the galaxies within them can survive longer , eventually merging on a timescale related to the dynamical friction time .    for this analysis , we have upgraded the cole ( 1994 ) model in various ways .",
    "the main modification is the replacement of the `` block model '' ( cole & kaiser 1988 ) as the description of the merger history of dark matter halos . in the new scheme we use a monte carlo method based on the analytical expression for the halo progenitor mass function derived from the  extended press - schechter theory \" ( bond 1991 ; bower 1991 ; see also lacey & cole 1993 ) to generate binary merger trees .",
    "each tree describes a possible merger history for a halo of specified final mass . at each branch in the tree",
    "a halo splits into two progenitors , but unlike in the `` block model , '' the mass ratio of the two progenitors can take any value .",
    "this technique enables the merger process to be followed with high time resolution , as timesteps are not imposed on the tree but rather are controlled directly by the frequency of mergers .",
    "it is similar in spirit to the method used by kauffmann ( 1993 ) , but has several advantages , including that it does not require the storage of large tables of progenitor distributions .",
    "the new merger scheme is fully described in lacey & cole ( in preparation ) .",
    "a further modification to the scheme is that the singular isothermal sphere model adopted by cole as a description of the dark matter halo density profile has been replaced by the analytical form proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) on the basis of high resolution n - body simulations . in the original cole model all the gas that could cool over the entire life of the halo",
    "was assumed to be available to form stars from the beginning of the halo lifetime .",
    "we now estimate the supply of cold gas available to form stars by calculating the cooling rate at a series of discrete timesteps in which successive shells of gas can cool .    in our scheme ,",
    "a cosmological model is specified by an assumption about the nature of the dark matter together with values for the cosmological parameters : the mean cosmic density ( @xmath32 ) , the cosmological constant ( @xmath33 ) , hubble s constant ( @xmath34 ) , the rms mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , and the mean baryon density in units of the critical density ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "our galaxy formation prescription requires specifying 6 physical parameters : ( i ) a star formation timescale ( @xmath38 ) , ( ii ) a  feedback parameter , \" ( iii ) the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars , ( iv ) an overall luminosity normalisation given by the ratio of the total mass in stars , including brown dwarfs , to the mass in luminous stars , ( v ) a merger timescale for galaxies , and ( vi ) the threshold mass for a galaxy merger to turn a disk into a spheroid ( see cole 1994 and baugh 1996b for further details . )",
    "the general strategy that we have adopted in this and previous papers ( baugh 1996ab , frenk 1996 , 1997 ) , is to fix the first 5 basic parameters of the model to obtain the best possible match to the local b - band and k - band galaxy luminosity functions and the sixth parameter to reproduce the local relative abundances of ellipticals , s0 s and spirals .",
    "it turns out that these requirements severely restrict the allowed range of parameter values , except for the imf which in any of the commonly used forms ( ie .",
    "salpeter ( 1955 ) , miller - scalo ( 1979 ) or scalo ( 1986 ) ) has little effect on the predicted _ local _ luminosity function . the evolution of the characteristic luminosity , @xmath39 , however , is sensitive to the choice of imf , which therefore affects predictions for the counts of faint galaxies ( see cole 1994 ) . for the most part",
    ", we have adopted the same values of the parameters as used in the fiducial model of cole et al .",
    ", allowing ourselves the freedom to use different forms for the imf .",
    "we again assume that feedback is a strong function of the halo circular velocity .",
    "the two exceptions are that we have slightly reduced the star formation timescale , @xmath38 , from 2 to 1.5 gyr and we have doubled the ratio of the galaxy merger timescale to the dynamical time in the halo .",
    "the former change leads to an abundance of lyman - break galaxies in better agreement with the data ( c.f . ",
    "3.2 ) while the latter change compensates for minor differences introduced by our new monte - carlo scheme for the halo merger trees . with this choice of parameters",
    ", our new model produces luminosity functions that are very similar to those published by cole we have updated the original bruzual - charlot stellar population synthesis model with their new version ( also for solar metallicity only ; bruzual & charlot 1993 , charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 . )",
    "fixing the model parameters by reference to a small subset of the data produces a fully specified model which can then be tested against other data , particularly high redshift data .",
    "thus specified , our model has predictive power and we have presented a number of specific predictions in earlier papers .",
    "two of these are particularly relevant to the present discussion .",
    "the first concerns the redshift distribution of a survey of faint galaxies limited to magnitude @xmath40 ( see figure  20 of cole 1994 ) .",
    "data have now been obtained by glazebrook ( 1995b ) and by cowie ( 1996 ) .",
    "our model predictions are in good agreement with these data , as may be seen in fig .  1 of frenk ( 1997 ) ( see also fig .",
    "15 of white & frenk 1991 and kauffmann , guiderdoni & white 1994 ) .",

    "typically , we generate between 5 and 20 different realizations for each mass , depending upon the press - schechter abundance .",
    "the galaxy formation rules are applied along the branches of each halo tree , starting at the highest redshift of interest and propagating through to @xmath47 .",
    "volume - limited samples or redshift catalogues are generated from the model output by weighting the galaxies in a halo tree of a given mass by its predicted press - schechter abundance at @xmath48 .",
    "mock catalogues consisting of galaxies selected according to any colour - magnitude criteria can be readily generated from the model output .    to construct mock catalogues with the selection criteria of s96 ,",
    "we calculate broad band colours for the model stellar populations using the same set of customised filters employed by s96 .",
    "( the filter functions were kindly provided by c. steidel . ) the dominant effect that determines whether a galaxy is a uv dropout is absorption of the galactic uv light by intervening cold gas .",
    "we calculate the effect of absorption on the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of high redshift galaxies using the procedure developed by madau ( 1995 ) . in this way , we are able to select model galaxies according to exactly the same colour criteria as applied to the observational data by s96 .",
    "for most of this study we have generated trees starting at @xmath49 .",
    "a high starting redshift is desirable in order to minimize inaccuracies at the high mass end of the mass distribution of progenitors introduced when the monte - carlo scheme is applied over a large range of expansion factor ( lacey & cole , in preparation ) .",
    "we have checked , however , that our results are insensitive to the exact choice of @xmath46 . to obtain the expected total number of galaxies in the apparent magnitude range observed by steidel et al . ,",
    "@xmath50 , we also generated mock galaxy samples from a grid of halo masses laid down at @xmath51 .",
    "at @xmath50 , the median redshift is @xmath52 .",
    "in this section we investigate the properties of the lyman - break galaxies that form in our models and , wherever possible , we compare these to the properties of the real lyman - break galaxies discovered by s96 . specifically , we consider the number density , masses , star formation rates and sizes of these galaxies and we present predictions for their clustering properties . to fully specify a model we need to adopt values for the cosmological parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and also a value for the baryon fraction , @xmath37 , and an imf .",
    "there are considerable uncertainties in these choices .",

    "these parameters are typical of those favoured by large - scale structure constraints . for example , all of our models produce approximately the correct abundance of galaxy clusters at the present day and , under standard assumptions , the low - density models also match the 4-year cobe microwave background anisotropy data ( bennet 1996 ; liddle 1996 ; white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; cole et al . 1997 . ) for our standard @xmath1 cosmology , we vary the normalisation of the primordial fluctuation spectrum , considering both the above value , @xmath56 , adopted in the fiducial model of cole ( 1994 ) , and the lower value , @xmath63 , preferred by eke , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) for consistency with the observed cluster x - ray temperature function .",
    "we consider models with two different baryon fractions , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the first agrees with the estimate by copi , schramm & turner ( 1996 ) from big bang nucleosynthesis and the second is consistent with the claim of tytler , fan & burles ( 1996 ) of a low primordial deuterium abundance in gas clouds at high redshift .",
    "we consider three possibilities for the imf , all of which are consistent with solar neighbourhood data , given the uncertainties in its past star formation history : miller - scalo ( 1979 ) , scalo ( 1986 ) and salpeter ( 1955 ) ( see figure  4 in cole 1994 for the specific parametrizations used ) .",

    "we compare in fig .",
    "16 our theoretical predictions with several observational estimates including those based on the data of gallego ( 1995 ) and madau ( 1996 ) already described , and also the @xmath98-band data of lilly ( 1996 ) for @xmath99 . in all cases ,",
    "we have used the observers estimates of the total luminosity density , which are based on fitting a schechter function to the luminosity function and extrapolating it to all luminosities .",
    "the lilly data refer to the luminosity density at @xmath100 .",
    "this is less directly related to the instantaneous star formation rate than the h@xmath79 or @xmath86 luminosities , because it is dominated by somewhat older stars .",
    "the @xmath101 rest - frame luminosity is sampled by the observed b - band flux only at @xmath102 , so the estimate at @xmath103 requires a modest extrapolation from longer wavelengths .",
    "this introduces an additional uncertainty .",
    "the constants used to convert @xmath104 to total sfr are also listed in table 5 .",
    "the upper limit plotted at @xmath105 is based on the number of @xmath106 dropouts in the hdf , which are candidates to be lyman - break galaxies at @xmath107 ( madau , private communication ) .",
    "after the original version of this paper was submitted , many more data points have been added to the star formation history diagram and we reproduce here a selection of them . at low redshift , treyer ( 1997 )",
    "have estimated the star formation density from @xmath108 ( rest - frame ) fluxes ; sawicki ( 1997 ) have used photometric redshifts of galaxies in the hdf to infer the star formation density from @xmath109 fluxes ; connolly ( 1997 ) have used both optical and ground based near - infrared imaging of the hdf to infer star formation rates from @xmath101 fluxes .",
    "( the use of infrared data is particularly important for the accuracy of photometric redshifts at @xmath110 . )",
    "apart from the sawicki points at @xmath111 , the level of agreement amongst these different determinations is remarkable , although it is suggestive that both the sawicki and connolly points at @xmath112 lie above those from the cfrs survey , in better agreement with our model predictions .",
    "( the cfrs survey , however , has more galaxies and therefore smaller error bars at these redshifts . )",
    "overall , the agreement between theoretical predictions and data in fig .",
    "16 is impressive .",
    "it must be borne in mind that these are genuine theoretical predictions that predate the observational data .",
    "the theoretical curve in the upper panel of fig .",
    "16 is simply the time derivative of the integrated curve for the fiducial cdm model plotted in figure  21 of cole ( 1994 ) .",
    "note , however , that the location of the observational data points depends on the assumed imf ; cole used a scalo imf whereas in  3.2 , we found a miller - scalo or salpeter imf to be preferable . for a given luminous star formation rate , @xmath113 ,",
    "a miller - scalo imf gives @xmath114 times the h@xmath79 flux , @xmath115 times the @xmath86 flux and @xmath116 times the @xmath101 flux compared to a scalo imf . comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "16 , we see that the main effect of changing the imf from miller - scalo to salpeter is to move the @xmath27 data point based on the h@xmath79 luminosity .",
    "both models  a and  g show the same qualitative trend as the data , with a broad peak in the total sfr at @xmath117 . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the model sfrs fall off somewhat more slowly than the data .",
    "the completeness of the observational data at these high redshifts , however , is difficult to establish .",
    "a further source of uncertainty is the possible presence of dust in the star - forming galaxies .",
    "even a modest amount of dust would cause attenuation of the ultraviolet flux , leading to a potentially severe underestimate of the star formation rate .",
    "tentative detections of the cosmic infrared background by puget ( 1996 ) and guiderdoni ( 1997a ) and upper limits on it ( kashlinsky , mather & odenwald 1996 ) provide only weak constraints on the amount of dust present in high redshift galaxies ( madau , pozzetti & dickinson , 1997 ; guiderdoni 1997b ) .",
    "monolithic collapse models ( e.g. eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) in which a significant fraction of the total star formation in the universe takes place at high redshifts enshrouded in dust ( e.g. meurer 1997 ) , appear to overpredict the total mass of heavy elements in place at early times ( madau 1997 ) , as inferred from observations of damped lyman-@xmath79 systems ( pettini , smith , king & hunstead 1997 ) .",
    "estimates of the factor by which star formation rates deduced from uv flux should be revised to account for the presence of dust span a range of values .",
    "the results are sensitive both to the form of the extinction law adopted and to the assumed age of the primeval galaxy which determines how intrinsically blue it is .",
    "primeval galaxies in our models are not , in general , ultraluminous starbursts since they never experience exceptional star formation rates . in this case , dickinson ( in preparation ) and pettini ( 1997 ) argue that the likely correction is around a factor of @xmath119 at @xmath120 for star formation rates inferred from @xmath86 fluxes .",
    "these corrections are a factor of @xmath121 smaller than those advocated by meurer ( 1997 ) . in fig .",
    "16 , we illustrate the effect of the pettini correction at high redshift by multiplying the points of madau ( 1996 ) by a factor of 3 ( open squares ) .",
    "the correction appropriate to the lower redshift points is also uncertain and we do not attempt to illustrate it in fig .",
    "it is likely to be smaller than at high redshift since the star formation rates are derived from longer wavelength data .",
    "a related observational constraint on the evolution of the galaxy population comes from observations of neutral hydrogen at high redshift using quasar absorption lines .",
    "17 compares the evolution of the cold gas fraction in our models with estimates by storrie - lombardi ( 1996 ) , derived from the statistics of damped lyman - alpha absorption lines .",
    "whereas kauffmann s ( 1996b ) semi - analytic models agree quite well with these data , our own models agree only in the qualitative sense that the comoving cold gas density has a broad peak at a redshift @xmath122@xmath123 .",
    "our models predict consistently more cold gas than is inferred from the observations . on the other hand",
    ", the observational results may underestimate the total cold gas density in galaxies because ( i ) they only include atomic hydrogen at column densities @xmath124 , and do not include ionized or molecular gas at all ; and ( ii ) dust obscuration may cause some absorption systems to be missed . regarding ( i ) ,",
    "all the gas in our model galaxies at @xmath125 is counted as `` cold '' ; the correction for ionized gas and for low column - density hi ( @xmath126 ) is probably not large , but the correction for molecular hydrogen might be significant . regarding ( ii ) , the chemical evolution models of pei & fall ( 1995 ) suggest that because of dust obscuration , the true neutral hydrogen density is 2 - 3 times higher than the `` directly measured '' value , moving the observational points in fig .",
    "17 much closer to the theoretical curves . the dotted - line set of errorbars in fig .",
    "17(a ) show plausible corrections for these effects , using the output from one of the models of pei & fall ( 1995 ) , following figure 2 of storrie - lombardi ( 1996 ) .",

    "the curve in the upper panel shows the evolution of @xmath127 with redshift in model  a. the dependence of @xmath128 with redshift in models b and  c which differ from  a only in the choice of imf , are identical to that in a. the curve in the lower panel shows results for model  g. the data points are observational estimates , based on damped lyman - alpha absorption lines from storrie - lombardi ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have applied an approximate scaling to their @xmath129 estimates to derive the corresponding values for the flat low-@xmath76 model  g. the data point at @xmath27 is based on the @xmath130 luminosity function of nearby galaxies derived from @xmath131 observations .",
    "the dotted - line errorbars in the upper panel show the corrections to the data suggested by storrie - lombardi to account for the effects of incompleteness and of dust obscuration , using a model from pei & fall ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have retained the same fractional errors on the corrected data points .",

    "the solid line is for model  a , the dotted for model  g and the dashed for model  c. [ fig : nphnb ]    an interesting issue is whether massive stars in young galaxies can , on their own , produce enough ionizing photons ( @xmath135 ) to re - ionize the igm by @xmath6 .",
    "( additional ionizing photons are produced by quasars , and possibly by pregalactic stars formed at high redshift via molecular hydrogen cooling , e.g. tegmark 1997 ) . a very simple criterion for establishing",
    "if re - ionization is possible by redshift @xmath136 is based on the ratio @xmath137 , where @xmath132 is the total number of ionizing photons produced per comoving volume up to redshift @xmath136 , and @xmath133 is the total comoving density of hydrogen atoms .",
    "when @xmath134 , just enough ionizing photons are produced to ionize each hydrogen atom exactly once .",
    "this criterion neglects absorption of photons within the emitting galaxies , recombination of hydrogen in the igm , and depletion of the igm by collapse of gas into dark halos .",
    "in particular , the fraction @xmath138 of ionizing photons that escape from a galaxy may be quite low : dove & shull ( 1994 ) estimate @xmath139 for our own galaxy , while leitherer ( 1995 ) estimate @xmath140 from far - uv observations of nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the photon number density , @xmath132 , is also sensitive to the form of the imf above @xmath141 .",
    "18 shows the dependence of @xmath137 on redshift for models a , c and g.",
    "we have used a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation to interpret recent data on galaxy formation and evolution within the context of hierarchical clustering theories , focussing primarily on the properties of the recently discovered population of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath142 .",
    "our modelling technique allows us to identify the role that this population plays within the general scheme of galaxy formation , and to relate these observations to other data at lower redshifts .",
    "our models are quite general , but they inevitably require a number of assumptions and simplifications most of which , in fact , reflect our poor understanding of the processes of star formation and feedback . within these limitations",
    "we attempt to represent the relevant physics using scaling laws that involve the smallest possible number of free parameters .",
    "our modelling strategy is based on fixing these free parameters by requiring that the models should match a small subset of the local data , particularly the field b - band galaxy luminosity function .",
    "thus specified , the models possess predictive power and can be tested against high redshift data .    the specific cold dark matter models that we have considered all share the feature that they reproduce the observed abundance of present day rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "this fixes the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations which determines the epoch at which structures on any mass scale form .",
    "current large - scale structure data allow a range of values for the cosmological parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by way of illustration ,",
    "we have explored in detail a critical density model and two low - density models , one open and the other flat .",
    "a second common feature of the models we have considered is that they all agree at some level with most data on the evolutionary properties of galaxies at relatively modest redshifts , @xmath143 , such as the evolution of the luminosity function ( baugh 1996a ) , and the counts of galaxies as a function of magnitude , morphological type , and redshift ( cole 1994 , baugh 1996b , frenk 1996 ) .",
    "several interesting predictions of the models have been corroborated by subsequent data , including , for example , the redshift distribution of @xmath40 counts ( frenk 1997 ) .",
    "an important prediction of semi - analytic models which also predated the acquisition of the relevant data is the cosmic star formation history , first discussed by white & frenk ( 1991 ) and calculated by cole ( 1994 ) and heyl ( 1995 ) for the specific models discussed here ( c.f .",
    "we showed in section  5 that madau s ( 1996 ) recent data agree well with these model predictions , although uncertainties remain in this comparison because of the unknown effects of dust obscuration and possible incompleteness in the observational samples at high redshifts .",
    "in particular , the possibility that a significant fraction of the total star formation may have been missed in recent surveys if it occured in dust enshrouded starbursts at very high redshift has been the subject of some recent debate .",
    "such a population is not predicted in our models , although a certain amount of dust obscuration at high redshift can be accommodated and may even be required : our models , in fact , predict star formation rates which are somewhat higher than those inferred from the data uncorrected for dust obscuration ( c.f .",
    "16 ) . the star formation rate in our models peaks around @xmath144 ,",
    "but it never varies by more than an order of magnitude over the entire range @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , the star formation rate at @xmath28 is almost identical to the star formation rate at the present day",
    ". nevertheless , half of all the stars present today only formed since @xmath146 .",
    "the significance of the lyman - break galaxies in the context of these models lies in the fact that at the epoch when these galaxies are observed , the process of star formation is just beginning in earnest .",
    "thus the lyman - break galaxies are the first massive objects to sustain appreciable star formation and , in this sense , they signal the onset of galaxy formation .",
    "the _ distribution _ of star formation rate at different redshifts provides even stronger constraints on models than the evolution of the integrated star formation rate .",
    "our models match existing data quite well , and further observational measurements of this fundamental quantity are very important . in both models and observations ,",
    "the quiescent star formation rates are relatively low even in the largest protogalaxies , with the majority of galaxies never forming stars at rates exceeding a few solar masses per year .",
    "the exception to this are galaxies that undergo a burst of star formation as a result of experiencing a major merger .",
    "however , predictions for the strength , duration and frequency of such bursts will require more detailed modelling that we have attempted so far .    in our models ,",
    "the lyman - break galaxies form from rare peaks in the density field at high redshift . as a result",
    ", we predict that their spatial distribution at @xmath0 should be strongly biased relative to the underlying mass , with a typical bias parameter , @xmath147 , and a comoving clustering length , @xmath4 .",
    "generically , we expect the lyman - break galaxies to be rotating disks , and a simple model for the origin of their angular momentum predicts typical half - light radii of @xmath148 .",
    "the lyman - break galaxies seen at @xmath0 evolve into the present day ordinary ellipticals and spirals that make up the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "their stars will typically be concentrated in the central regions of their descendants .",
    "these descendants are to be found preferentially in groups and clusters , reflecting their biased origin and strong clustering at high redshift .",
    "the appearance of the first protogalaxies at @xmath149 and the late conversion of most of the gas into stars fit in well with the observation that the neutral hydrogen content of the universe , as determined from measurements of damped lyman - alpha clouds , peaks at around @xmath150 and declines thereafter ( storrie - lombardi 1996 ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density in our models also exhibits this overall behaviour and agrees reasonably well with the data once corrections for incompleteness and a small amount of dust obscuration are included .",
    "related semi - analytic models by kauffmann ( 1996b ) agree even better with these data .",
    "our models are consistent with madau s ( 1996 ) view that , with the discovery of lyman - break galaxies , the bulk of the star formation ( and the attendant metal production ) in our universe has , in effect , been identified .",
    "only a small fraction of the star formation activity remains to be detected during the `` dark ages '' prior to @xmath91 .",
    "characterising such activity is , of course , of great importance for testing the general view that galaxies formed by hierarchical clustering . according to our models , the small percentage of stars that formed prior to the lyman - break galaxy epoch produce enough radiation to make at least a significant contribution to the uv flux required photoionize the intergalactic medium by @xmath28 .",
    "although a late epoch of galaxy formation in the standard cdm model was predicted long ago ( frenk 1985 , white & frenk 1991 ) , a surprising result of our analysis is that this is also true of the now popular low - density variants of this model . indeed , the star formation histories of the @xmath1 model and the flat @xmath57 model are remarkably similar .",
    "this is largely coincidental : the detailed star formation histories depend not only on the shape of the power spectrum , but also on its normalisation and on the way in which star formation and feedback are implemented in our galaxy formation models .",
    "the main conclusion of our analysis is that , regardless of the exact values of the cosmological parameters , cdm models that approximately reproduce the abundance of lyman - break galaxies , require massive galaxy formation to begin around @xmath149 .    in summary",
    ", we have argued in this paper that the main ingredients of a consistent picture of galaxy formation may now be in place .",
    "the key observation that has unlocked this paradigm is the discovery of a large population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 which signal the onset of the epoch of galaxy formation that extends well into the present day . at this time , data and theoretical modelling paint only a broad brush picture of how galaxy formation may have occurred .",

    "<S> we use a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering theories to interpret recent data on galaxy formation and evolution , focussing primarily on the recently discovered population of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath0 . for a variety of cold dark matter ( cdm ) </S>",
    "<S> cosmologies we construct mock galaxy catalogues subject to identical selection criteria to those applied to the real data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the expected number of lyman - break galaxies is very sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function and to the normalization of the primordial power spectrum . for reasonable choices of these and other model parameters , it is possible to reproduce the observed abundance of lyman - break galaxies in cdm models with @xmath1 and with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic masses , circular velocities and star - formation rates of the model lyman - break galaxies depend somewhat on the values of the cosmological parameters but are broadly in agreement with available data . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies generally form from rare peaks at high redshift and , as a result , their spatial distribution is strongly biased , with a typical bias parameter , @xmath3 , and a comoving correlation length , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical sizes of these galaxies , @xmath5 , are substantially smaller than those of present day bright galaxies . in combination with data at lower redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> the lyman - break galaxies can be used to trace the cosmic star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> we compare theoretical predictions for this history with a compilation of recent data . </S>",
    "<S> the observational data match the theoretical predictions reasonably well , both for the distribution of star formation rates at various redshifts and for the integrated star formation rate as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> most galaxies ( in our models and in the data ) never experience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year . </S>",
    "<S> our models predict that even at @xmath6 , the integrated star formation rate is similar to that measured locally , although less than 1% of all the stars have formed prior to this redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the weak dependence of the predicted star formation histories on cosmological parameters allows us to propose a fairly general interpretation of the significance of the lyman - break galaxies as the first galaxy - sized objects that experience significant amounts of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies mark the onset of the epoch of galaxy formation that continues into the present day . </S>",
    "<S> the basic ingredients of a consistent picture of galaxy formation may well be now in place .    </S>",
