    "the evolution of clusters of galaxies has important implications to our knowledge of the fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "as they are the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe , the evolution of clusters is highly sensitive to the physics of cosmic structure formation and the values of the fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "moreover , clusters are valuable laboratories to study the evolution of many galaxies at a common redshift .",
    "although a number of galaxies with luminosities @xmath15 are now observed out to redshifts @xmath16 ( @xcite ) , very few candidate clusters of galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed at redshifts near or above unity ( @xcite ) . at these very high redshifts ,",
    "the prevalence of clusters , proto - clusters , or other large scale structures in the galaxy distribution is as yet unknown , and the evolution of large scale structures may well be at a critical stage ( @xcite ) , where observations can directly constrain cosmological models .    at intermediate redshifts , powerful radio - galaxies",
    "are frequently located in rich clusters ( @xcite ) , therefore , a possible search strategy is to look for clusters around known powerful radio - galaxies . as part of a program to identify clusters and study their properties at redshifts larger than @xmath17 ,",
    "we report here the discovery of galaxies within @xmath18 mpc and 1000 kms@xmath13 from the 1jy radio galaxy mrc0316 - 257 ( @xcite ) , at @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 and @xmath21 are used throughout this letter .",
    "we have observed a @xmath22 field around mrc0316 - 257 with the multi object imaging spectrograph ( mos ) at cfht ( @xcite ) .",
    "deep broad band v and i images as well as narrow band images in a filter with central wavelength 5007  and bandwidth 96 , containing the @xmath7 line redshifted to @xmath0 , were obtained the night of 20 december 1995 .",
    "several images were obtained for each filter , after small telescope offsets were performed , to improve the flat fielding accuracy .",
    "total integration times were 2700 , 1200 , 5100 seconds in v , i and the 5007  filters , respectively .",
    "standard image processing was performed the next day , and the v and 5007  images were blinked visually to provide a list of cluster candidates for subsequent multi - slit spectroscopy during the nights 21 - 24 december 1995 . the narrow band 5007  images can be expected to identify galaxies with @xmath7 in a redshift range @xmath23 , foreground galaxies with [ oii]3727  in emission with a redshift @xmath24 , or the rarer occurence of galaxies with [ oiii]5007  with @xmath25 .",
    "the narrow band image is compared to the v band image of the mrc0316 - 257 field in figure 1 ( plate 1 ) .",
    "two galaxies exhibit strong excess emission in the narrow band filter , and were subsequently observed spectroscopically , together with more marginal candidates .",
    "multi - slit masks were prepared with the highest priority given to the cluster candidates as defined above , and other slits were placed on galaxies brighter than @xmath26 when no other candidate was available .",
    "the observations of about 30 galaxies per mask were performed with the o300 grism , with 300 l / mm and peak transmission at @xmath275900 ,  and slits @xmath28 wide , providing a spectral range of 4500 - 9000  and a resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "three masks have received cummulated exposure times of 19800 , 8700 , and 8700 seconds .",
    "data reduction of the spectra in the first mask obtained the night of 21 december 1995 was performed the following afternoon , and confirmed that these candidate galaxies had emission lines at @xmath275030 .",
    "these galaxies were subsequently reobserved in the following multi - slit mask for a total exposure time of 28500 sec .",
    "final data reduction was performed with the multired package implemented under iraf , and redshifts were measured and assigned classes as described in le fvre et al .",
    "the two galaxies common to 2 different masks were treated separately by averaging the flat - fielded and sky corrected 2d spectra obtained from each 2 mask .",
    "the @xmath30 detection limit in the shortest integration spectra is @xmath31 erg@xmath12sec@xmath13@xmath13  around 5000 , and our spectra would have allowed us to identify any emission line with a flux larger than @xmath32 erg@xmath12sec@xmath13 .",
    "a total of 51 galaxies have secure redshift measurements in the range @xmath33 ; 2 stars were identified , and we failed to measure redshifts for 45 galaxies .",
    "mccarthy et al . ( 1990 ) noted that @xmath7 was the only feature in support of their redshift for mrc0316 - 257 , while eales et al .",
    "( 1993 ) identified [ oiii]5007 from ir spectroscopy .",
    "our spectra confirm @xmath7 in emission , as well as civ1549 , heii1640  and ciii]1909  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the redshift of the radio - galaxy mrc0316 - 257 is therefore @xmath2 .",
    "the v image shows another galaxy of roughly equal magnitude 2.7 arcseconds away , while in the 5007  image the eastern galaxy disappears almost completely .",
    "in addition to the radio - galaxy , we have identified spectroscopically two galaxies with a redshift similar to the radio - galaxy .",
    "the first one , `` galaxy a '' , is 44 arcseconds away from the radio - galaxy .",
    "its spectrum shows a strong line at 5030.3 , and faint features with marginal s / n at the same redshift ( fig.2 ) .",
    "a cross  correlation of the spectrum of galaxy a , after subtraction of the 5030  emission line , with a template spectrum with line widths taken from @xcite ( 1996 ) , gives a marginal correlation at z=3.14 with a correlation coefficient r=2.8 .",
    "the observed equivalent width of the emission line is 230@xmath34 , which , if it was [ oii]3727  at z=0.350 , would indicate a rest frame @xmath35 , larger than any equivalent width for galaxies in the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) , or 3 times larger than for any galaxies at @xmath36 in the cfrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , all galaxies in the cfrs with rest @xmath37  have rest @xmath38  and @xmath39 , which would have been easily identified in our spectra at a redshift @xmath40 .",
    "the identification of the line at 5030  with @xmath7 at @xmath3 seems therefore to be secure .",
    "the second galaxy , `` galaxy b '' , is located 182 arcseconds from mrc0316 - 257 .",
    "its spectrum shows @xmath7 and civ1549 , and therefore gives a secure redshift @xmath4 .",
    "both civ1549 , and to a lesser extent @xmath7 exhibit a broad component , which indicates the presence of an agn .",
    "close examination of the images indicate that both mrc0316 - 257 and `` galaxy a '' are resolved under fwhm=1.5 arcseconds seeing , while `` galaxy b '' is only marginally resolved .",
    "after deconvolution from the observed psf , the half - light radii of mrc0316 - 257 and `` galaxy a '' , are @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 kpc respectively .",
    "the fact that galaxy b is quite compact supports the contribution of an agn .",
    "the v , i and @xmath7 images of galaxy a are strinkingly different : the peaks of continuum v and line emission are offset by 0.6 arcsec , with the peak of @xmath7 emission extending toward the sw , where little or no continuum light is detected in the v and i bands , and little or no emission is observed in i at the peak of @xmath7 emission , while several blobs of emission appear 3 arcseconds to the nw in the i band .",
    "in figure 3 we plot the ( v@xmath44i ) vs ( v@xmath445007 ) color - color diagram .",
    "besides mrc0316 - 257 , and the two associated galaxies identified in spectroscopy , two galaxies have significant excess emission in the 5007  filter ( v@xmath445007@xmath451.2 ) . one of these galaxies has a redshift @xmath46 , and the excess emission in the 5007  filter is coming from the [ oii]3727  emission line . the other galaxy ,",
    "galaxy c , has not been observed spectroscopically .",
    "therefore , in our imaging field of view of 78.2 arcmin@xmath47 , we have three confirmed galaxies at @xmath0 , above our detection thresholds of @xmath48  and @xmath49 , and a fourth galaxy , galaxy c , which remains a good but unconfirmed candidate galaxy at @xmath0 .    any estimate of the space density of @xmath50 galaxies from our observations is necessarily quite uncertain due to the small number of objects which we detect .",
    "the maximum redshift depth probed is set by the range over which our narrow band filter would detect the ly@xmath1 emission line , i.e. @xmath51 . under that assumption ,",
    "the resulting co - moving cosmological volume surveyed is therefore @xmath52mpc@xmath53 assuming @xmath54 .",
    "( for @xmath55 , the effective volumes are 7.4@xmath56 larger , and the densities correspondingly smaller . )",
    "however , the three galaxies which we have confirmed spectroscopically are confined to a much smaller redshift range , close to the radio galaxy : @xmath57 .",
    "this corresponds to a rest  frame velocity difference @xmath58 km  s@xmath13 , quite in line with expectations for galaxy clusters and/or `` walls '' of large ",
    "scale struture .",
    "it is therefore likely that the effective `` cluster '' volume is much smaller than the value given above . assuming @xmath59 , the corresponding co - moving volume",
    "would then be @xmath60mpc@xmath53 .",
    "we therefore may bracket the range of possible space densities by assuming @xmath61 ( mpc@xmath62 , or @xmath63mpc@xmath64 , with a `` best guess '' value of @xmath65mpc@xmath66 .",
    "the population of @xmath67 field galaxies identified by steidel _",
    "_ 1996 has a comoving space density of @xmath68mpc@xmath66 for @xmath69=0.5 . at face value",
    ", this would imply that our `` best guess '' space density represents an overdensity of @xmath70 compared to the field population at similar redshift .",
    "however , it is difficult to make a direct comparison between our `` cluster '' space density and the``field '' value since our galaxies were selected on the basis of strong ly@xmath1 flux , and have brighter continuum magnitudes ( @xmath49 ) than the steidel _",
    "_ objects ( which have @xmath71 @xmath72 ) .",
    "therefore the estimate given above for the cluster overdensity is almost certainly a substantial _ underestimate . _",
    "even our derived lower limit of @xmath73mpc@xmath66 for the 0316 - 257 field is substantially higher than the corresponding space density of field galaxies sharing the same continuum magnitudes and ly@xmath1 properties .    the rest frame @xmath7 equivalent widths are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , for the radio galaxy , and galaxies a and b respectively .",
    "while the radio - galaxy and galaxy b have resolved @xmath7 , with @xmath77  and @xmath78  respectively , and civ is resolved for galaxy b , with @xmath79  after deconvolution by the instrumental response , @xmath7 is unresolved at our resolution for galaxy a. this may indicate that @xmath7 in galaxy a is produced mainly by stellar photo - ionisation . even after correcting for the contribution of the lyman alpha line to the v band , galaxy a is extremely blue , with @xmath80 .",
    "this is very unusual for faint galaxies , and indeed galaxy a is by far the bluest object in our field of view , as can be seen from figure 3 .",
    "galaxy a is bluer than most or all of the z@xmath273 objects reported by steidel et al .",
    "it is also interesting that its lyman alpha emission is significantly stronger than that in most of the steidel et al .",
    "lyman break galaxies .",
    "the blue color and strong ly - a emission may indicate an object dominated by ob - stars in a strong starburst with very little dust .",
    "the complex morphology of galaxy a is quite different from the morphology of galaxies identified on the basis of the 912  discontinuity ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with complex spatial distribution of continuum and line emission as described in section 3 . while the evidence for old stars will have to be searched for at redder wavelength , this galaxy might well be forming its first stars and fit the definition of a proto - galaxy .",
    "we have spectroscopically identified 2 galaxies at the same redshift as the radio - galaxy mrc0316 - 257 , z@xmath81 .",
    "these galaxies exhibit @xmath7 in emission with @xmath82 .",
    "one galaxy is resolved with a size @xmath83 mpc , has unresolved @xmath7 , and extremely blue @xmath9 color , which might indicate that the main photo - ionising process is coming from a first generation of young stars in a low dust medium .",
    "the other galaxy is unresolved , and has broad @xmath7 and civ emission lines , indicating the presence of an agn .",
    "these observations of galaxies around mrc0316 - 257 provide tentative evidence for a region of high galaxy density , possibly indicative of clustering of galaxies occuring at @xmath19 .",
    "they indicate that the search for galaxies around very high redshift radio - galaxies is indeed possible from @xmath7 imaging techniques . however , the total number of galaxies identified with an observed @xmath7 luminosity @xmath11 erg@xmath12sec@xmath13 is small , indicating the limits of this technique , in agreement with previous searches .",
    "lyman break techniques , as successfuly applied by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , will be required to identify additional galaxies at the same redshift and confirm the existence of a cluster or proto - cluster of galaxies .",
