    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is turbulent on scales ranging from aus to kpc ( see elmegreen & scalo 2004 for a review ) , with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of its properties .",
    "mhd turbulence is generally accepted to be of key importance for fundamental astrophysical processes , e.g. star formation , propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays ( mckee & ostriker 2007 , lazarian et al . 2009 ) .",
    "a substantial insight into the scale density fluctuations has been obtained via studies of radio scattering and scintillations .",
    "it was shown in armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the spectrum of density inhomogeneties is consistent with the kolmogorov turbulence over a wide range of scales from @xmath1 @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath3 ( see also spangler & gwinn 1990 , wang et al .",
    "2005 , you et al .",
    "the theoretical explanation of this effect is provided within goldreich - sridhar ( 1995 ) model of turbulence , where kolmogorov spectrum of magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations is expected ( see also cho & lazarian 2003 , beresnyak & lazarian 2009 ) .",
    "but what is happening at larger scales ?",
    "the question was addressed by a number of recent studies .",
    "for instance , haverkorn et al . (",
    "2008 ) used the southern galactic plane survey data and concluded that the injection scale of the turbulence in the spiral arms of the galaxy should be rather small , e.g. order of a parsec , while a much larger , e.g. order of 100 @xmath5 , outer scale is reported for the interarm regions .",
    "this , however contradicts to the smooth power laws observed for velocity fluctuations in hi ( green 1993 , lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) and thus stimulates a further quest of density fluctuations at large scales .    in the paper",
    "below we address this question by analyzing the wisconsin h@xmath0 mapper ( wham ) data ( see madsen , haffner & reynolds 2002 ) .",
    "we check the consistency of the fluctuations of wham and those measured by scintillations and scattering to the kolmogorov cascade .    in",
    "what follows , we discuss the wham data in sect .",
    "2 , expected angular spectrum of fluctuations in sect .",
    "3 , determination of the spectrum s free parameters in sect .",
    "4 and provide discussions in sect .",
    "5 . in appendix",
    "a we describe the algorithm of correcting background level errors .",
    "the wisconsin h@xmath0 mapper has surveyed the distribution and kinematics of ionized gas in the galaxy above declination @xmath6 .",
    "the wham northern sky survey ( wham - nss ) has an angular resolution of @xmath7 and provides the first absolutely calibrated , kinematically resolved map of the h@xmath0 emission from the warm ionized medium ( wim ) within @xmath8  km / s of the local standard of rest @xcite .",
    "we used the publicly available wham integrated intensity data for high galactic latitudes .",
    "the choice is motivated by reducing the noise from localized regions , e.g. hii regions , in the galactic disk .",
    "the integrated wham map consists of patches of contiguously observed data of size 7x7 pointings .",
    "the background levels in the patches are different due to different observation conditions .",
    "such patching causes a systematic error , which requires a proper handling , especially in the low - signal area near the north galactic pole ( ngp ) .    our data handling included the equalization of background signal level in the adjacent patches of the emission map .",
    "the particular algorithm is described in the appendix [ sect : syserr ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the original and the processed data .",
    "one may notice that the original data is patchy and one expects these borders of the patches to contribute strongly into measured spectrum .",
    "the processed data exhibits fluctuations , but do not exhibit rectangular domains of varying intensity .    according to @xcite , dust extinction in the direction of ngp is only 3% for h@xmath0 and is neglected in our calculations .",
    "the processed data is used to estimate spectrum parameters .",
    "we do this by probing signal fluctuations at two different scales with subsequent fitting of the angular spectrum model .",
    "the latter has two free parameters , which depend on the outer scale of turbulence and amplitude of electron density spectrum .",
    "the results are tested for statistical consistency .",
    "this approach allows us to recover information about the density spectrum despite rather small dynamical range of scales characterizing the wham data .    as the actual observable for h@xmath0 data",
    "is the emission measure ( @xmath9 ) , we needed to handle the case of quadratic emissivity to bind the expected to be kolmogorov spectrum of @xmath10 to the angular spectrum of h@xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "we attempt to test whether the wham data is consistent with the hypothesis of the kolmogorov energy cascade originating at large spatial scales . to achieve this goal we , first of all",
    ", must relate the power spectrum of underlying density and the angular spectrum of intensity fluctuations . the latter is usually measured in terms of spherical harmonics . in  3.1 and  3.2",
    "we derive the necessary expressions and make use of the wham data in  3.3 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a homogeneous isotropic random field in a 3d space",
    ". then its mapping to the angular coordinates is given by the following expression :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a window function setting the layer thickness .",
    "the correspondent correlation function depends only on @xmath14 :    @xmath15    after some algebra we can get : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a power spectrum of @xmath11 .",
    "having calculated the angular power spectrum @xmath18 we obtain : @xmath19    if we choose @xmath13 in a gaussian form with the layer thickness @xmath20 @xmath21 we can write @xmath22 where @xmath23    after some algebra we can find the following asymptotic expression for the kernel @xmath24 : @xmath25 which holds for @xmath26 uniformly over @xmath27",
    ".    the expressions [ eq : mapgauss ] and [ eq : qappr ] give us a simple mapping from 3d power spectrum @xmath28 to the angular spectrum @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq : mapgauss ] ) analytically : @xmath32      as the @xmath33 emissivity is quadratic with respect to the underlying physical field ( electron density ) , we have to account for the related effects .",

    "if @xmath37 is a power spectrum of @xmath38 , we can write the following expression for the emissivity power spectrum @xmath17 , assuming that @xmath38 is a gaussian field : @xmath39 where @xmath40 let us find an approximation for @xmath41 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath37 has kolmogorov spectral index and a low - wavenumber cutoff at @xmath42 : @xmath43 then , @xmath41 can be approximated using the method of matched asymptotic expansion for the asymptotic limits @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath45 should decrease as @xmath46 with a scaling factor of @xmath47 , which can can be illustrated as follows . as the spectral index is greater than 3",
    ", the bulk of the integrated value of @xmath37 exists in a region near @xmath48 . for very large @xmath49 ,",

    "for those values of @xmath81 the dispersions calculated using the wham data are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where the instrumental error of 0.04 r is accounted for .    to estimate the consistency of our assumption of the kolmogorov turbulence present in warm gas sampled by wham we calculate the probability distribution of the free parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "( [ 3.5 ] ) in terms of @xmath75 , one gets @xmath97 where @xmath98    below we shall use eq .",
    "( [ 4.2 ] ) to derive the probability distribution @xmath99 that will be used to estimate the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 and their accuracy .",
    "if we write the elementary probability in the @xmath100 space as @xmath101 , we get the following jacobian of the transformation : @xmath102 which results in the expression for the probability : @xmath103 where one should substitute @xmath104 for its expression , i.e. @xmath105 .    the practical implementation of the finding probability distributions @xmath106 and @xmath107 is illustrated in figures 2 and 3 . the both curves were re - normalized .",
    "initially they had encompassed the area of 0.85 , which meant that the model spectrum was inconsistent with the observational data with the probability of 0.15 . using the calculated pdfs",

    "the big power law in the sky with the spectral index coincided with the one in kolmogorov turbulence was discussed in the paper of armstrong et al .",

    "astrophysical scales the plot in armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) contains either upper limits or unreliable data , for instance , rough estimates based on turbulent velocity .",
    "this paper contains the first piece of evidence that the spectrum of density fluctuations at very small scales shown in armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) agrees well with the spectrum of the density fluctuations measured at scales of @xmath2 m , if we assume that the scale height of the free - free emitting layer is @xmath112 .",
    "the found spectrum amplitude @xmath113 is within the error bar from the value @xmath114 found by @xcite from pulsar scintillations .",
    "this is a remarkable extension of the big power law in the sky .",
    "this is suggestive of the energy being injected at scales of @xmath115 in the galaxy and cascading up to very small scales . below",
    "we discuss whether this case is a plausible one .",
    "does this picture of the large scale turbulent energy cascade look reasonable ?",
    "density information alone can not answer this question .",
    "turbulence is a dynamical process , in which density can be used only as a tracer .",
    "more direct information is available through velocity studies .",
    "our estimation is also in agreement with the expected value of 100 pc associated with supernova explosions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "studies in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2009 ) of the velocity turbulence using the velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) provide a good fitting of the turbulence model when the injection scale is taken to be @xmath116 @xmath5 ( vcs uses fourier - transformed over velocity coordinate spectral data to get analytically predictable data measure , see @xcite . ) .",
    "in addition , mhd simulations in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) indicate that for subsonic turbulence the density spectrum follows well the velocity spectrum , which is kolmogorov .",
    "this is however is not true for supersonic mhd turbulence , for which , according to beresnyak , lazarian & cho ( 2005 ) the density spectrum gets shallow .",
    "we feel that the issue of the spectral slope does require further studies . with our limited dynamical range we could test the consistency of the spectral index to the kolmogorov one .",
    "discontinuous structures , e.g. ionized ridges of clouds make the spectrum more shallow .    what is the mach number of the free - free emitting layer in our galaxy ?",
    "this question was addressed by hill et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who compared the pdfs obtained via mhd simulations in kowal , lazarian & beresnyak ( 2007 ) and the pdfs of wham data . as a result",
    "a conclusion that the sonic mach number of turbulence in free - free emitting layer , which is also frequently called the reynolds layer , is around of 2 .",
    "this is close to the subsonic range and therefore we do not expect to see substantial deviations from the kolmogorov scaling for the random density .",
    "all in all , the arguments above are consistent with the idea that the large scale turbulence in the reynolds layer and small scale turbulence constituting the big power law in armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are the parts of the universal turbulence cascade .",
    "this is also consistent with other arguments , for instance , with the theoretical arguments on the energy injection in turbulence .",
    "both of the leading ideas on the injection of turbulent energy , i.e. via supernovae explosions and via the magnetorotational instability , inject energy at large scale , e.g. larger than 30 pc .",
    "this energy is bound to create a cascade in high reynolds number interstellar medium .",
    "therefore the emergence of the extended turbulent cascade is expected .",
    "the present study shows the consistency of the data with the kolmogorov cascade in interstellar gas spanning over 10 decades .",
