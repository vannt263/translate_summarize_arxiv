    "it is widely believed that density and temperature fluctuations in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are responsible for the forest of absorption lines observed in the spectra of qsos .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the results of numerical simulations that are able to reproduce accurately the statistical properties and main features of the observed high - resolution spectra ( cf . , weinberg 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "at the same time , observations of the high redshift forest with keck telescopes ( hu  1995 ; lu  1996 ; kirkman & tytler 1997 ) and of the local forest with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( shull , penton , & stocke 1999 ; penton , stocke , & shull 1999 ) have sufficient spectral resolution and signal - to - noise to permit a detailed study of the thermal properties of the igm and comparisons with the output of cosmological simulations .",
    "in hierarchical dark matter dominated cosmological models , the formation of the forest depends on two loosely related pieces of information : the evolution of the dark matter and the thermal history of the igm .",
    "is , instead , better known . ]",
    "recent work by croft  ( 1999 ) in large part solved the problem of recovering the power spectrum of the dark matter from the absorption spectra .",
    "thus , the thermal history of the igm remains the only piece of information still unrecovered from the observational data on the forest .",
    "this paper complements the work of croft  ( 1999 ) by attempting to recover the thermal history of the igm from the data .",
    "it has been shown ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) that in sufficiently low density igm ( cosmic overdensity @xmath5 ) the gas temperature is tightly ( to within a few percent ) related to the gas density , with a power - law relation of the form @xmath6 , which we will call an `` effective equation of state '' because it appears to relate the density and the temperature of the gas .. ] the thermal history of the igm can then be described with high precision by the time evolution of the two parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the most simple physical model of the photoionized igm adopted in all currently existing numerical simulations ,",
    "this evolution is determined by the balance of adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the universe and photoionization heating of hydrogen and helium .",
    "however , it is also possible that compton heating from hard x - rays ( madau & efstathiou 1999 ) , radiative transfer effects , and time - dependent  reionization can be important processes affecting the thermal history of the igm ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ; ferrara & giallongo 1999 ) .",
    "the most readily available piece of observational data is the joint distribution of the column densities and doppler ( @xmath0 ) parameters of absorption lines .",
    "since the column density of an absorption line strongly correlates with the density of the gas in which the line originates ( miralda - escud  1996 ; hernquist  1996 ) , we can use the column density of a line as a measure of the gas density . at the same time , the width of the line contains information about the gas temperature .",
    "thus , we can recover the information about the evolution of the  of the igm from the @xmath9 distribution of the forest .",
    "this was also noted independently by schaye  ( 1999 ) .    undoubtedly , a better way to recover the  could be developed , using the  absorption spectra rather than @xmath9 distributions .",
    "however , this method is not yet developed .",
    "in addition , @xmath9 distributions are readily available as published data , whereas the absorption spectra are not .",
    "thus , we proceed with analyzing @xmath9 distributions with the understanding that our results could in principle be improved upon by using the full information available in the absorption spectra .    at low redshifts ( @xmath10 ) the amount of the intergalactic gas that is shock heated is thought to be larger than at higher redshifts ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "this , in principle , can induce unrecovable systematic effects into our method .",
    "however , dav  ( 1999 ) have shown that the  applies down to redshift @xmath11 even if the fraction of gas that is shock heated and that does not belong to the simple power - law relation increases at low redshifts . a relation between the column density and the overdensity of clouds also holds at @xmath12 .",
    "we can thus be confident that we can measure the  of the igm at low redshifts as well .",
    "even at @xmath12 , there still exist a population of absorbers that are not shock heated and which define the lower cutoff of the @xmath9 distribution ( dav  1999 ) .",
    "the resulting lines are distinct , narrow features in the hst spectra ( penton 1999 ) ; it is this population that we select by our method . in other words ,",
    "the approach we adopt automatically selects against the shock - heated gas and thus is quite suitable for measuring the even at low redshift .",
    "the paper is organized in four sections . in   [ sec : method ] we describe our method to measure the  of the igm .",
    "we study the output of numerical simulations for several cosmological models in order to understand how the thermal broadening of the lines affects the @xmath9 distribution . in ",
    "[ sec : sim_results ] we describe the results of the method on the synthetic spectra created using the simulation outputs , and in   [ sec : z - evol ] we apply the method to real observations of the forest at @xmath13 . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we discuss the results and their implications on understanding the thermal history of the igm .",
    "we follow three logical steps to derive the .",
    "first , we analyze the result of several numerical simulations using the voigt profile fitting code autovp ( dav  1997 ) to build synthetic @xmath9 distributions used to check the method .",
    "we consider several distinct cosmological models with different values of the ionizing intensity at 1 ryd , @xmath14 ( in units of @xmath15 erg 2 s@xmath16 hz@xmath16 sr@xmath16 ) , and the .",
    "we also analyze different random realizations of the same model at the same or higher resolution .",
    "we use the hydro - pm approximation to model the low - density igm , which allows us to scan a large set of cosmological models and random realizations with sufficient numerical resolution , a task , currently unachievable with the full hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we demonstrate that the systematic errors introduced by the hpm simulations are completely negligible compared to other systematic and statistical errors present in the method and the observational data .",
    "we find that the thermal broadening @xmath17 km s@xmath18 of a line with peak overdensity @xmath19 ( we use the notation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the baryon density and @xmath22 is the mean baryon density ) corresponds to the value of @xmath23 at the maximum of the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "values of @xmath24 are possible because of the spread of the @xmath25 distribution and because the voigt profile fitting routine introduces some lines that do not correspond to density peaks .",
    "another reason why the cutoff of the @xmath9 distribution is not sharp is that errors on @xmath0 and @xmath26 smooth out the distribution .",
    "this effect is negligible for the simulated lines because we pre - determine the continuum flux , zero flux levels and higher signal to noise , but it is important for the observational data .",
    "second , we find an efficient way to locate the maximum of the @xmath9 distribution . in order to use all the information available , we use the maximum likelihood analysis ( mla ) method to fit a parametric two - dimensional function to the data points in the @xmath27 space .",
    "this allows us not only to locate the maximum of the distribution but also to study its shape .",
    "we will see that this could be a powerful way to extract information on the physics of the low - density clouds .",
    "we apply the mla method to the simulated lines and demonstrate that the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the  lie inside the @xmath28 confidence level of the values that we measure for all the models and random realizations .",
    "third , we apply the mla to real data sets at redshifts @xmath29 , and we measure the location of the maximum and the shape of the distribution .",
    "we account for the errors on @xmath0 and @xmath26 that , as already mentioned , spread the real shape of the distribution . at this point , we use the results of the simulations to interpret the @xmath0 values at the maximum of the distribution as due to thermal broadening .",
    "this gives us the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath26 but not the .",
    "we still need to know the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath21 , therefore we use the results we obtained from the simulations in conjunction with the density peak ansatz approximation to determine this relationship ( this is our second hypothesis based on the simulation results ) .",
    "it turns out that we only need to know the column density of the absorption lines with zero peak overdensity , @xmath31 , to derive the  within the observational accuracy .",
    "we use an approximate simulation technique called hpm , developed by gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) , to model the fluctuations in the low - density igm ( @xmath32 ) . in its essence",
    ", the hpm method uses a simple particle - mesh ( pm ) solver modified to account for the effect of gas pressure .",
    "the predefined  is then used to compute the gas temperature and pressure at every point directly from the value of the cosmic gas density at this point .",
    "thus , there is no need to introduce a special equation for the gas temperature as in a full hydrodynamic solver . as a result ,",
    "the hpm approximation is only about 25% slower ( due to the overhead of computing the equation of state ) than a simple pm solver .",
    "it is substantially faster than a full hydrodynamic solver ( due to both fewer computations at each time step and fewer time steps ) , while delivering results that are sufficiently accurate for our purposes .    in order to verify the accuracy of the hpm approximation ,",
    "we performed voigt profile fitting for the full hydrodynamic simulations and for the hpm simulation with the same initial conditions and resolution used in the original hpm paper ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) . figure [ fig : hcbn ] shows the @xmath9 distributions for the full hydrodynamic simulation and the hpm approximation plotted on top of each other .",
    "the two distributions agree quite well .",
    "figure [ fig : hcbb ] shows the comparison between the measured @xmath0-parameters of the individual lines from two simulations . while at high @xmath0 values the spread is significant , mostly due to the fact that the doppler profile fitting is not a uniquely defined procedure , at low @xmath0 values the hpm and the full hydrodynamic simulation agree on a _ line - by - line basis _ to better than observational uncertainties .    in order to estimate the systematic error in the position of the peak of the @xmath9 distribution introduced by the hpm simulation ,",
    "we have applied our method ( described below ) to the two distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcbn ] . we have found that the intercepts , @xmath33 , of the @xmath34 relations ( see ) agree within 0.5% , and the slopes , @xmath35 , agree within 3.5% .",
    "thus , the systematic error in the position of the introduced by the hpm simulation is completely negligible ( at least a factor of 10 smaller ) compared to the other systematic and statistical uncertainties ( as discussed below in more detail ) .    numerical resolution is very important for accurately modeling the forest ( gnedin 1998 ; theuns  1998 ; bryan  1999 ) .",
    "the hpm simulations used in this paper have a cell size of @xmath36 and resolve the filtering scale @xmath37 over which the baryonic fluctuation is smoothed , @xmath38 ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) by about a factor of three .",
    "this choice of the resolution scale has also been confirmed as sufficient by other authors using the full hydrodynamic simulations ( theuns  1998 ; bryan  1999 ) .",
    "we produce synthetic spectra of the forest at @xmath39 for eight of the 25 different flat cosmological scenarios simulated using the hpm approximation in gnedin ( 1998 ) .",
    "the first three models , scdm.2a , scdm.2d , and scdm.2e , are three random realizations of the same model , scdm.2l is the same cosmological model with a different , lcdm.3a is a cdm model with the cosmological constant , chdm.3a represents a class of cold+hot cdm models , and ocdm.1a is an open cdm model .",
    "all of these simulations have @xmath40 cells and thus have a box size of @xmath41 . in order to test the effect of box size",
    ", we also analyze a larger simulation of the scdm.2a model .",
    "this simulation , labeled scdm.l2a , has @xmath42 cells and box size of @xmath43 . as has been shown in gnedin ( 1998 ) , the @xmath43 size of the computational box is sufficient to reduce the cosmic variance in the column density distribution to a few percent .",
    "the parameters of the models are summarized in table  [ tab : s1 ] , where we preserve the labeling used in gnedin ( 1998 ) .",
    "we used the autovp voigt profile fitting routine ( dav  1997 ) to measure @xmath26 and @xmath0 for absorption lines along a thousand lines of sight in each simulation .",
    "this gives us about ten thousand absorption lines per simulation .",
    "we use this @xmath9 distribution to verify the ability of our method to recover the assumed .      -na scatter - plot ( black dots ) of the column density versus density at the peak of density fluctuations for the model lcdm.3a at @xmath39 , calculated by using the density peak ansatz approximation and the simulations to measure the second derivative at the peak of the density perturbations ( see   [ ssec : n - d ] ) .",
    "the long - dashed line corresponds to the best fit using constant weighting of the lines and the solid line using weighting @xmath44 to account for the 0.5 slope of the logarithmic column density distribution .",
    "there exists a tight correlation between the intergalactic gas density and temperature in the low - density regime , where shock heating is not important ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the density - temperature relation is well described by a power - law , @xmath45 where @xmath7 is the temperature of the gas at the mean cosmic density of baryons and @xmath8 describes how the temperature changes with density .",
    "it is clear that , if @xmath46 , the temperature of the igm is constant everywhere ( the isothermal case ) .",
    "the evolution of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 depends on the reionization history of the universe .",
    "thus , measuring the  would potentially allow us to uncover the evolution of the ionizing background in the universe , and @xmath9 distribution of the forest offers us a way to measure @xmath7 and @xmath8 as a function of redshift simply because the doppler @xmath0 parameter is related ( albeit indirectly due to peculiar velocities ) to the gas temperature , whereas the column density of an absorber is known to be tightly correlated with the gas density .",

    "the contour plot is the @xmath25 distribution re - mapped on the @xmath49 space using the  and ( [ eq : bt ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to peculiar velocities being set to zero .",
    "the solid line is the   rewritten in terms of the thermal width of the lines as a function of the column density derived using ( [ eq : bn ] ) to relate the column density and the gas density .",
    "as explained in the text , we use only absorption lines in a small range of the column densities .",

[",
    "fig : d - n ] and as explained in ",

    "it is evident that the solid line does not define the lower envelope of the @xmath9 distribution owing to small - number statistics and to the intrinsic spread of the @xmath25 distribution .",
    "however , both the solid line and the lower envelope track one another .",
    "indeed , because we decided to fit the @xmath25 distribution instead of finding its upper cutoff ( the cutoff toward high column densities ) , the thermal broadening @xmath57 will correspond to the peak of the @xmath9 distribution instead of its lower cutoff . in fig .",

    "armed with this finding , in the next section we will seek an efficient way to locate the maximum of the @xmath9 distribution and demonstrate that , within the errors of the measurement , we are able to recover @xmath57 .    when we apply this method to the observed forest in   [ sec : z - evol ] , we can only measure directly @xmath57 as a function of the column density @xmath26 .",
    "we do not have a relation between the column density and overdensity in this case .",
    "the parameters of the  are related to the measured @xmath35 and @xmath62 by the equations : @xmath63 in ",

    "we define a likelihood function @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the probability for the line @xmath66 to have a width @xmath67 and the column density @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the number of lines in the sample .",
    "if we describe the magnitude of the errors by a gaussian distribution , then the probability function @xmath70 observed is related to the true one by the double convolution : @xmath71~dn~db\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the errors on @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the correlation coefficient between the errors in @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "usually , the errors on the column density and doppler parameter tend to be anticorrelated ( @xmath79 ) , especially when the line is saturated , since the fit tends to preserve the equivalent width of the line .",
    "we adopt a parametric model for @xmath80 and the free parameters are determined by maximizing the likelihood function ( efstathiou  1988 ) .",
    "a simple and accurate method of estimating errors is to determine numerically the ellipsoid of parameter values defined by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath35-point of the @xmath83 distribution with @xmath84 degrees of freedom and @xmath85 is the confidence level wanted .",
    "the degrees of freedom are the number of lines minus the free parameters of the distribution . the parametric function , ( [ eq : pnb ] ) , that we adopt to fit the @xmath9 distribution , has nine free parameters , thus the ellipsoid of the errors is nine - dimensional .",
    "we are only interested in determining the errors on @xmath33 and @xmath35 . the rigorous way to find these should be to project the hyper - ellipsoid on the @xmath86 space but this is computationally expensive .",
    "we use an approximate method that consists of maximizing the likelihood function with respect to all the other parameters for each value of @xmath33 and @xmath35 .    in general ,",
    "the matrix of errors is not diagonal , and the errors on the parameters are correlated .",
    "the value of @xmath87 that makes errors on @xmath0 and @xmath35 uncorrelated ( , the ellipse has principal axes parallel to the cartesian plane and the matrix of errors is diagonal ) is the average column density of the sample of lines used in the fit .",
    "we choose @xmath87 in order to minimize the correlation of the errors .",
    "the value of @xmath87 changes in each mla mainly because the range of the column densities of the data - set changes .",
    "these are the main advantages of the method : ( i ) the mla method has well - defined asymptotic error properties ( , kendall & stuart 1961 ) ; ( ii ) there is no requirement to select bin widths ; ( iii ) it is possible to account for errors on both @xmath0 and @xmath26 ; ( iv ) we can also study the shape of the distribution ; ( v ) all the data are used ; ( vi ) there is no need to find the distribution cutoff that is not well defined because of artificial lines and metal lines .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it is difficult to test whether the assumed parametric form of @xmath80 is a good fit to the data . in this paper , we adopt this method but we have also used a classic minimum of chi - square algorithm to fit the function @xmath88 averaged over small intervals of the column densities , selecting several bin widths of @xmath26 .",
    "this preliminary study has been useful to choose the form of the parametric function that is a good fit to the data .    in the literature , the @xmath0 distribution is basically fitted with two types of parametric functions : ( i ) a gaussian with a low @xmath0 cut - off , ( , a three - free - parameter function ) ( kirkman & tyler 1997 ) and ( ii ) a one - parameter function of the form ( hui & rutledge 1999 ) : @xmath89 , \\label{eq : n(b)}\\ ] ] where @xmath90^{1/2}$ ] is the @xmath0 value at the peak of the function . here @xmath91 is the baryon smoothing scale , @xmath92 is the resolution width , @xmath93 is the linear growth factor ( @xmath94 in a flat cosmology ) and @xmath95 is the rms linear density fluctuation approximately at the jeans scale .",
    "we find that neither of these functions provides a good fit to the data .",
    "instead , we use ( [ eq : n(b ) ] ) with the exponents of @xmath0 in the power - law tail and in the exponential cutoff as free parameters .",
    "we notice that , as the column density increases , the power - law tail of the distribution becomes more narrow and the exponential cutoff becomes more sharp .",
    "we have also tried a simple power - law @xmath96 with a low @xmath0 cutoff , motivated by the fact that the exponential cutoff is very sharp , but we have found that this form of the distribution is not a good fit to the data .",

    "we do not use the hui & rutledge relation for @xmath105 because the jeans smoothing scale in this expression is needed only if we want to relate the dark matter density to the baryon density and temperature .",
    "we already include this smoothing scale in the @xmath106 expression that we derive in ",
    "[ ssec : n - d ] .",
    "we assume that the broadening of the lines due to the simulation / observation resolution is negligible in the range of the column densities considered .",
    "we also find that the values of the parameters @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are practically zero in all the mlas for the simulations and observations as well .",
    "the shape of the distribution is then determined by 6 parameters : @xmath33 and @xmath35 which determine the value of @xmath103 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 which are related to the power law tail , @xmath112 related to the exponential cutoff , and @xmath113 the slope of the column density distribution .",
    "we do not know the correlation coefficient @xmath78 of the errors on @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor ] , when we change @xmath78 between zero and -0.95 , the values of the parameters determined with the mla change by at most 20% , well below the observational accuracy or the accuracy of our method .",
    "the number of absorption lines in each simulation is about @xmath114 , but we are restricted to use lines in a range of the column densities approximately one decade wide .",
    "this reduces the number of lines to about @xmath115 .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath26 is determined for each simulation by imposing a maximum overdensity at the line center , @xmath116 , which is the limit below which hpm simulations produce accurate results",

    "the relative errors on @xmath0 and @xmath26 are about @xmath117 , smaller than typical observational errors , since we assumed a higher signal - to - noise ratio than is usually afforded by the observational data ( in order to test our method in more challenging conditions ) and because we do not have uncertainties due to continuum fitting and zero flux level .",

    "we note that the value of @xmath111 is surprisingly constant for all the models but one .",

    "abel & haehnelt ( 1999 ) have recently shown that radiative transfer effects can increase the  photoheating rate respect to the optically thin approximation by up to a factor 4 .",

    ", the latter model provides a remarkably good fit to the observed thermal history of the igm .",
    "other possible sources of heating in the igm are photoelectric dust heating ( nath , sethi , & shchekinov 1999 ) and compton heating by hard x - rays .",
    "recent results ( madau & efstathiou 1999 ) indicate that the second could be an important heating source at redshifts larger than @xmath186 but photoheating is dominant at lower redshifts . photoelectric heating of dust grains could be a minor source of heat but some recent observations show anly a small amount of dust in the high-@xmath154 forest ( outram  1999 )",

    "one of the intriguing predictions of many hydrodynamic simulations ( cf . ,",
