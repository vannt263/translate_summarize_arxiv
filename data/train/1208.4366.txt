    "as stars are born with the imprint of the elemental abundances in their gaseous birth environments , measurements of stellar metallicities within galaxies can be used to gain insight into their star formation and chemical histories @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we carry out an explicit test of the self - consistency between empirically derived star formation histories , observational scaling relations between gas phase metallicity ( @xmath4 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath5 ) , and star formation rate ( @xmath6 ) , and observed stellar metallicities at @xmath3 .",
    "it has long been known that there is a strong positive correlation between the luminosity or stellar mass of star forming galaxies and their galaxy - averaged gas - phase abundance @xcite .",
    "this relationship ( the `` mass - metallicity relation '' ) has now been measured for large samples of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for smaller samples of distant galaxies out to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the normalization , slope , scatter , and evolution of the observed mass - metallicity relationplace strong constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation , in particular on the physics of feedback from massive stars and supernovae .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the scatter in the observed mass - metallicity relation  can be reduced by considering the star formation rate as a third parameter @xcite .",
    "physically , the star formation rate is probably acting as a proxy for the galaxy gas fractions , as galaxies with higher gas fractions have both higher star formation rates and more diluted metals @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite find that galaxies up to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear to always lie on the same @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 `` fundamental '' relation , though this may begin to break down at @xmath9 ( @xcite , though see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is not yet clear whether or why a non - evolving mass  metallicity  star - formation rate relation should be generically expected , although some cosmological models do predict this ( @xcite ; m.  arrigoni et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "self - regulation due to stellar - driven outflows is usually invoked in this context @xcite .",
    "there is a long history in the literature of attempts to model the chemical evolution of galaxies using a `` classical '' approach , the simplest version of which is the `` closed box '' , in which galaxies start out with all of their mass in the form of pristine gas , and convert some fraction of that gas to stars , producing a certain `` yield '' of heavy elements along the way .",
    "it was quickly realized that the simplest closed box picture could not reproduce observations , in particular of the distribution of stellar metallicities in the solar neighborhood in our galaxy ( the `` g - dwarf '' problem ) , leading to modifications such as inflowing pristine or pre - enriched gas as well as outflows of gas and metals @xcite . while much has been learned from this approach , it has the obvious drawback that the results tend to be dependent on the rather arbitrary functions adopted for the inflow and outflow rates .",
    "another approach that has become fairly widely used is the coupling of detailed chemical evolution models with cosmological models of galaxy formation , realized in the form of either numerical hydrodynamic simulations @xcite or semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "these have the advantage that quantities such as the rate of inflow of gas into galaxies is motivated by the formation rate of structure in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm that provides the backbone for these models , and outflow rates are also governed by physically motivated scalings .",
    "however , they suffer from the drawback that currently , all cdm - based galaxy formation simulations , whether numerical or semi - analytic , apparently fail to reproduce the observed scaling of star formation history functional form with galaxy mass ( sometimes referred to as `` downsizing '' ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .    here",
    "we propose a different approach to modeling the buildup of metals in galaxies that sidesteps some of the problems with both the classical and cosmological methods .",
    "we make use of a family of parameterized empirical star formation histories , derived from observations of the stellar mass vs.  star formation rate relation at different redshifts by @xcite .",
    "these empirically - derived star formation histories are in good agreement with those derived from spectral energy distribution modeling and the evolution of the stellar - halo mass relation @xcite .",
    "we assume that the _ average _ star formation history for galaxies with a given stellar mass today can be represented by this smooth functional form .",
    "this assumption is supported by mounting observational evidence that galaxies with masses of roughly the milky way or lower ( @xmath10 few @xmath11 ) build up most of their mass through smooth accretion of gas , with mergers and starbursts playing a relatively minor role @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by results from cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "then , once stellar mass loss and recycling has been accurately accounted for @xcite , the growth of galaxies can be traced through cosmic time by stepping along these @xmath12 relations as a function of redshift .",
    "we make a second assumption , that galaxies always evolve _ along _ the @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 relation .",
    "that means that as galaxies evolve along their trajectories in @xmath5-@xmath6 space ( specified by their star formation history ) , we assume that the stars born at that moment form out of gas with a metallicity @xmath4 given by the @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 relation . in this way , we can build up the _ distribution function _ of stellar metallicities for galaxies with different masses at @xmath3 .",
    "we can also test whether the two assumptions of empirical star formation histories plus a non - evolving @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 relation lead to an average stellar metallicity relation at @xmath3 that agrees with observations . both of these quantities will be better constrained observationally over a wider range of galaxy masses , and to higher redshift , in the near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : relations ] , we describe our adopted and predicted scaling relations connecting galaxy stellar masses , star formation rates , and gas - phase metallicities across cosmic time . in  [ sec : stars ] we present the stellar metallicity distribution functions and evolution of the stellar metallicity - mass relation predicted by this model .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of relevant implications in  [ sec : conc ] .    throughout we assume a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( integrated over @xmath13@xmath14 ) and",
    "@xmath15@xmath16 @xcite , although we note that the 8.9 value found from helioseismology @xcite would lead to @xmath17dex lower @xmath18 values than stated here .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a flat @xmath19cdm cosmology with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the model we present here is based on two simple assumptions : 1 ) galaxies average star formation histories are given by the empirical functions provided by @xcite , in which their @xmath3 stellar mass determines the shape of their star formation histories .",
    "2 ) galaxies evolve along a `` fundamental '' @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 relation that is itself unchanging with redshift . taken together ,",
    "these pieces provide a unique enrichment history for an average galaxy of a given present day stellar mass @xmath22 . in this section",
    "we describe these two pieces of our model , where they come from , and some caveats , in a bit more detail .",
    "+     the starting point for the first piece of the model is measurements of galaxy stellar masses and star formation rates from @xmath0 to 2.5 by @xcite , from the cosmos survey .",
    "it is now well established that @xmath5 and @xmath6 show a fairly tight and nearly linear relationship which evolves in normalization , but very little in slope , over a very broad redshift range @xcite .",
    "these results of course represent snapshots of different galaxy populations at different cosmic times . @xcite first fit power laws to these snapshots in time , using the @xmath23 results measured by @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25gyr@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "he then characterized how _ individual _ galaxies would have to grow over time in @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 such that the evolution of these relations would be satisfied , accounting for mass loss and recycling from evolving stellar populations using the method presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , these @xmath23 relations can be integrated to give the star - formation history for a galaxy of a given stellar mass @xmath22 at @xmath3 , @xmath29 .",
    "the top left panel of figure[fig : scaling ] shows the fits representing the population averages at different redshifts , with the trajectories of individual galaxies of different @xmath22 overplotted .",
    "the two obvious limitations of this method are that it only describes galaxies that are actively forming stars at @xmath3 ( i.e. , there is no accounting for a galaxies that cease forming stars and `` fall off '' of these relations ) and that it is only valid up to redshifts and stellar masses where the @xmath5-@xmath6 relation is reliably measured . however , the majority of galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath30 are on the `` star forming main sequence '' @xcite , i.e. on the relations used to derive the @xcite star formation histories . based on observational estimates of merger rates @xcite , the scatter in the observed @xmath5-@xmath6 relation @xcite , and theoretical predictions @xcite ,",
    "galaxies in this mass range are expected to build up the majority of their mass through smooth accretion , with mergers and starbursts playing a minor role . on the second point ,",
    "the star formation histories @xcite  derives from @xcite s data are not entirely reliable at @xmath31 due to observational uncertainties ( i.e. , the redshifts for which @xmath6 has not been well - measured for @xmath32 ) .",
    "we further note that the star formation histories for @xmath33 galaxies at @xmath3 are entirely based on extrapolations , as the progenitors of these galaxies can not currently be observed at higher redshift .",
    "this is true to some extent at somewhat higher masses as well ( @xmath34 ) , with extrapolation becoming less important as @xmath22 increases .",
    "@xcitenotes that the star formation histories derived for @xmath35 galaxies predict a much larger fraction of recent star formation than those derived from resolved stellar population studies : the @xcite  star formation histories for these low mass galaxies imply that all of their star formation takes place at @xmath36 , while the resolved stellar population studies indicate that a significant fraction of past star formation occurred at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the other three panels show the predicted evolution of the @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xmath4-@xmath6 , and @xmath4-@xmath38 relations , where for the gas - phase metallicity we plot the observable @xmath15  as would be measured from star - forming h@xmath39  regions derived from the @xmath0 @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6 relation .",
    "while several fits to the @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6  relation exist in the literature , we choose to calculate metallicities from the double - quadratic fit @xmath40_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize fmr } } = \\vspace*{0.5em}\\\\ \\qquad 8.90 + 0.37m- 0.14s - 0.19m^2 + 0.12ms - 0.054s^2 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , fit to sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data by @xcite .",
    "@xcitepostulate that this so - called `` fundamental metallicity relation '' ( fmr ) holds at all redshifts , and show that the observed @xmath43 galaxies fall along this relation when extrapolated to higher star formation rates .",
    "equation([eqn : fmr ] ) is fit over the ranges @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( see @xcite for the exact @xmath46 $ ] bins used in their calculation ) ; we must extrapolate outside of this range in order to describe the metallicity evolution of @xmath47 galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "this parameterization is not @xcite s best fit to the data , but we find that this functional form is better suited to the necessary extrapolation than alternatives .",
    "specifically , equation([eqn : fmr ] ) will under - predict the metallicities for low - mass galaxies , compared to a more robust fit using @xmath48 as the independent variable , @xmath49_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize fmr},\\mu } = \\vspace*{0.5em}\\\\ \\qquad 8.90 + 0.39x - 0.20x^2 - 0.077x^3 + 0.064x^4 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this quartic parameterization leads to an up - turn in @xmath15  when extrapolated to low @xmath51 ; while no extrapolation in @xmath51 from @xmath3 to @xmath52 is needed to describe _ observed _ galaxies , extrapolation _ is _ required to describe the evolution of the local galaxies we wish to characterize .",
    "finally , @xcite describe the relation between stellar mass , gas - phase metallicity , and star formation rate as a plane , @xmath53_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize l10 } } = \\vspace*{0.5em}\\\\ \\qquad 0.891\\log{m_{\\star}}- 0.422\\log{\\dot{m}_{\\rm{sfr}}}+ 0.086 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] we choose , however , to not adopt this formulation because it gives even lower metallicities at high - redshift than equation([eqn : fmr ] ) , while overestimating metallicities at high @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that uncertainties in the calibration methods for determining @xmath15  compound the difficulty in accurately characterizing the @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these uncertainties not only affect the slope of the relation , but also its normalization at the @xmath54dex  level . thus it will certainly be possible to improve on the results presented here once the @xmath5-@xmath4-@xmath6  relation has been measured to lower masses ( e.g. , b.  andrews & p.  martini , in preparation ) and with more robust metallicity calibrations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; m.  dopita et al . in preparation ) .    from the top - right panel of figure[fig : scaling ] , it is obvious that on short timescales , galaxies evolve along the mean mass - metallicity relation(c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "though it is subtle , the mass - metallicity relationevolves slightly more rapidly at low masses than at high masses .",
    "the bottom two panels show that this is because massive galaxies asymptotically plateau in their metallicities , while low - mass galaxies are still rapidly evolving at late times .",
    "the galaxy tracks in the bottom - left panel of figure[fig : scaling ] show the metallicities at which galaxies are at the peak of their star formation . in ",
    "[ sec : stars ] , we integrate along these tracks to derive stellar metallicities as a function of cosmic time .",
    "because stars are born with the chemical imprint of the gas they formed out of , by tracing galaxies through the evolutionary tracks plotted in figure[fig : scaling ] , we are able to track  in an average sense  the buildup and change in stellar metallicities in different galaxies .",
    "figure[fig : stellar ] shows the distribution of the stellar [ @xmath1/h ] within individual galaxies of different @xmath5 at @xmath3 and the predicted relation between galaxy - averaged metallicities ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath5 . though the distribution of stellar [ fe / h ] has been well - measured for the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , [ @xmath1/h ] has not been as well characterized .",
    "the histograms in the top panel of figure[fig : stellar ] are based on _ all _ star formation , and thus are only applicable for comparing to metallicity distributions of low - mass stars , such as for the upcoming sdss - iii apo galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) observations of the milky way @xcite and @xmath56 dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group ( e.  kirby et al .  in preparation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our assumption that all galaxies of a given present - day stellar mass follow the same smooth star formation history may tend to underestimate the width of the ensemble - averaged stellar metallicity distribution function .",
    "it is well known that galaxies have somewhat stochastic star formation histories ( although apparently they typically do not deviate from the star forming main sequence by more than a factor of 23 ; @xcite ) , and that the overall shape of the star formation history can show considerable diversity from galaxy to galaxy , particularly for low mass objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these effects would tend to broaden the predicted metallicity distribution function and to lead to a corresponding galaxy - to - galaxy diversity in this quantity .",
    "however , they should not significantly affect our predictions for the galaxy- and ensemble - averaged mass metallicity scaling relations that we discuss below .",
    "the @xmath57 ( bright green ) distribution is included for comparison to the milky way @xcite ; we also show the distribution of [ o / h ] as measured for 72 local disk stars by @xcite , though we caution that it is unclear the extent to which these stars are representative of the entire milky way .",

    "the metallicity distribution functions turn over ; this is directly related to the decline in star formation rates at later times , resulting in the formation of relatively few higher - metallicity stars ( see the bottom - left panel of figure[fig : scaling ] ) .",

    "the stellar metallicity - mass relation is slightly steeper at higher redshift than at @xmath3 ; this evolution is driven by the relatively late buildup of stellar mass in low - mass galaxies relative to more massive galaxies , as can be seen in the top panel of figure[fig : scaling ] .",

    "this rather modest evolution is in stark contrast to the evolution seen at all stellar masses in the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation ( top - right panel of figure  [ fig : scaling ] ) ; this difference is primarily due to the earlier buildup of stellar mass in the more massive galaxies .",
    "we have combined empirically derived star - formation histories from observations of high redshift galaxies @xcite with the empirically determined relation between stellar mass , star formation rate , and gas - phase metallicity @xcite to derive the distribution of stellar metallicities at @xmath3 and the evolution of the galaxy - averaged stellar metallicity - mass relation ( figure[fig : stellar ] and tables[tbl : hist ] and [ tbl : mzevolve ] ) .",

    "this comparison , however , is hampered by both a lack of a well - measured @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath4 relation at low stellar masses , low star formation rates , and high star formation rates , and a lack of well - characterized @xmath1-element distribution functions in both the milky way and other star - forming field galaxies with @xmath82 . from the modeling side , upcoming characterizations of the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath4 relation to lower stellar masses and across a broader range of star formation rates ( b.  andrews & p.  martini , in preparation )",

    "upcoming surveys will also provide a more complete census of the stellar metallicity distribution function for the milky way ( e.g. , the sdss - iii apogee survey ) and local group dwarf galaxies ( e.  kirby et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we have assumed here that all of the scatter in @xmath15  at fixed stellar mass is related to variations in the star formation rate , but the resulting relation still has scatter that is correlated with , e.g. , galaxy size @xcite or environment @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scatter in @xmath55 at fixed stellar mass is known to correlate with galaxy age @xcite . in our framework , this can be seen as variations in galaxies star formation histories via the @xmath83dex  scatter in star formation rate at fixed stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this variation can be partially attributed to changes in environment @xcite , especially if environment introduces additional scatter to the @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have also assumed that the buildup of _ all _ of the stellar mass in a galaxy can be well described by equation([eqn : sfms ] ) .",
    "this is clearly not the case , as , e.g. , there are stars in the milky way that were formed before @xmath8 and with @xmath84 .",
    "however , these stars comprise a very small fraction of the total stellar mass or light , at least in the milky way , and could be addressed by more complete model of star formation histories , including minor mergers which bring in a populations of lower - metallicity stars .",
    "one of the strengths of the method presented here is that it does not require us to explain _ why _ the relationship between gas - phase metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rate apparently does not evolve with redshift by invoking carefully evolving gas fractions , accretion rates , or outflow efficiencies ( such as in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , integrating over the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation  does neatly predict what fraction of oxygen ever produced by a @xmath3 galaxy should be still locked up in stars , and how steeply this fraction should increase with stellar mass ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , by combining this kind of calculation with measurements of the mass - metallicity relation  and @xmath3  gas fractions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one can place constraints on the total amount of oxygen galaxies have expelled over their lifetime @xcite , though for star - forming galaxies , uncertainties in the gas - phase abundances and relevant gas masses make this calculation difficult .",
    "more globally , it is especially intriguing that the implied masses of both metals and all baryons expelled by galaxies over their lifetime appears potentially consistent with the oxygen mass observed in the circumgalactic medium of @xmath85 galaxies ( @xcite ; j.  werk et al .  in preparation ) .",
