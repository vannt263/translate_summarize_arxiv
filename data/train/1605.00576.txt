    "it is well known that the classical heat equation arises from the energy balance law @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the medium mass density and the medium specific heat respectively , together with the fourier law of heat conduction @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the obtained equation , even if widely used in different fields of the applied science , has the unrealistic feature to imply an infinite speed of heat propagation .",
    "different attempts to generalize the classical fourier law have been considered in the literature in order to avoid this unphysical paradox .",
    "the first relevant generalization , derived by cattaneo in @xcite is based on the following modification of the fourier law of heat conduction @xmath5 that , after substitution in , leads to the so  called _ telegraph equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath6 the related physical picture is described by the so  called _ extended irreversible thermodynamics _",
    "for completeness , we observe that is also named in literature maxwell  cattaneo law as it was firstly considered by maxwell and also cattaneo  vernotte law , since vernotte in @xcite considered the paradox of infinite speed of propagation at the same time of cattaneo .    a heuristic explanation of equation as a suitable modification of the classical heat flux law , is given by the idea that inertial effects should be considered in models of heat conduction , since the heat flux does not depend instantaneously on the temperature gradient at one point and therefore memory effects are not negligible .",
    "in this framework , a more general analysis about the role of memory effects in heat propagation , was then discussed in the classical paper of gurtin and pipkin @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the relation between the flux and the gradient of the temperature field is given by @xmath7 this equation describes a general heat flux history model depending by the particular choice of the relaxation kernel @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath9 $ ]",
    ", we recover the maxwell  cattaneo law .    again in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the linearized constitutive equation for heat propagation , based on equation , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy relaxation function . assuming that @xmath12 , this equation is related to finite speed of propagation equal to @xmath13 .",
    "we call the family of equations , depending by the particular relaxation kernel , a telegraph - type equation with memory .",
    "we consider also the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity coefficient @xmath4 in models of heat propagation with memory effects .",
    "in particular we assume that ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath14 this assumption typically leads to a different approach to the problem of finite velocity of heat propagation , _",
    "i.e. _ the application of nonlinear parabolic equation .",
    "it is possible to consider both the physical effects , namely memory and nonlinearity in the heat propagation problem , leading therefore to the nonlinear heat equation with memory @xmath15(x,\\tau ) d\\tau.\\ ] ] from now on we will take for simplicity @xmath16 .    in the pioneering papers by compte and metzler @xcite and",
    "then in the framework of the so  called fractional thermoelasticity @xcite , different interesting generalizations of the heat equation have been studied on the basis of physical and probabilistic derivations within the general theory of gurtin and pipkin of heat conduction with memory .    in the present paper",
    "we consider two interesting cases , corresponding to particular specializations of the relaxation kernel in equation .",
    "the first one is based on the application of a mittag  leffler relaxation function leading to a nonlinear generalized telegraph - type equation .",
    "the second case is related to the choice of a power - law relaxation function and leads to nonlinear fractional wave - type equation .",
    "we are able to solve the model equations in a simple analytic form by a generalized separating variable method in some particular interesting cases .",
    "in this section we study two classes of equations belonging to the family . the first one corresponds to a fractional cattaneo law introduced by compte and metzler in @xcite , presenting a long - time mittag - leffler relaxation function .",
    "the second one corresponds to the the choice of a power law decaying relaxation function , recently discussed by povstenko @xcite .",
    "as introduced in section 1 , the cattaneo law can be derived in the framework of the general theory of gurtin and pipkin @xcite by considering an exponential relaxation kernel .",
    "this corresponds to a short  tail memory relaxation function .",
    "a first heuristic generalization of the cattaneo law , in the framework of the fractional calculus , is based on the replacement of the exponential function with a mittag  leffler relaxation function , which corresponds to a long  tail memory relaxation function , according to the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed it is well  known that the one ",
    "parameter mittag ",
    "leffler function @xmath17 presents a power - law asymptotic slow decay ( for a complete review about this topic , we refer to the recent monograph @xcite ) .    by simple calculations , compte and metzler @xcite",
    "have shown that the generalized cattaneo law , obtained from the following relationship @xmath18 leads to the generalized telegraph equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 plays the role of a relaxation time constant coefficient .",
    "moreover a probabilistic derivation of such model in the framework of the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) have been discussed .",

    "we underline the physical meaning of the model equation , since two different physical effects are taken into account : ( i ) long - memory effects by means of a particular choice of the relaxation function in the gurtin - pipkin theory and ( ii ) nonlinearity due to the empirical dependence of the heat conduction coefficient .",
    "we underline that in many cases these two contributions are not taken into account at the same time ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "usually , the nonlinear theory for heat conduction is considered as an alternative to the cattaneo approach to avoid the paradox of infinite speed of heat propagation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the field of fractional calculus , this new physically motivated generalization of the telegraph equation opens new interesting problems both from the mathematical and the more applied point of view .",
    "we observe that , in rigorous terms , only in recent papers ( e.g. @xcite ) the existence problem of the solution of semilinear time ",
    "fractional wave equations have been considered , while for the nonlinear telegraph equation no results are present . here",
    "our aim is to introduce the problem from a physical point of view and discuss some particular cases in which this equation admits explicit solutions by means of the generalized separation of variables method @xcite .",
