    "<S> the meson production cross sections are estimated considering photon - photon interactions in hadron - hadron collisions at cern lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a large number of mesons with photon - photon partial decay width well constrained by the experiment and some mesons which are currently considered as hadronic molecule and glueball candidates . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the experimental analysis of these states is feasible at cern - lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern started high energy collisions two years ago . during this period a large amount of data </S>",
    "<S> have been collected considering @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 = 0.9 , 2.36 and 7 tev as well as @xmath2 collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev . </S>",
    "<S> currently , there is a great expectation that lhc will discover new physics beyond the standard model , such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should remember that the lhc opens a new kinematical regime at high energy , where several questions related to the description of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) remain without satisfactory answers . </S>",
    "<S> some open questions are the search for non-@xmath3 resonances , the determination of the spectrum of @xmath3 states and the identification of states with anomalous @xmath4 couplings . a possible way to study these problems is the study of meson production in two - photon interactions @xcite . in general , this process is studied in leptonic colliders . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is to use ultra - relativistic protons and nuclei , which give rise to strong electromagnetic fields and estimate the production of a given final state considering the photon - photon and photon - hadron interactions . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to study photon - photon interactions in proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions at lhc ( for a review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . recently , bertulani @xcite revisited this subject and proposed the study of the meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at lhc in order to constrain the two - photon decay widths . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend this previous study for the meson production in two - photon interactions in proton - proton collisions . </S>",
    "<S> initially we calculate the cross sections for mesons with photon - photon partial decay width well constrained by the experiment , which allows to constrain the theoretical methods and calibrates the experimental techniques . </S>",
    "<S> after we predict the cross sections for mesons which are currently considered as glueball and hadronic molecule candidates . </S>",
    "<S> our results shows that lhc can be used to investigate these states .    lets consider the hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath5 ) and at ultra relativistic energies ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> we expect the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant . in heavy ion colliders , </S>",
    "<S> the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other . in a similar way </S>",
    "<S> , it also occurs when considering ultra relativistic protons in @xmath6 colliders . </S>",
    "<S> the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( two - photon process ) or can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section . in the case of the production of a neutral state @xmath7 in two - photon interactions </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section is given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 characterizes the presence of a rapidity gap in the final state , @xmath10 is the squared center of mass energy , @xmath11 is the distribution function which is associated to the flux of photons generated by the hadron @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the photon and hadron energies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath17 is the photon - photon cross section given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spin , mass and the photon - photon partial decay width of the final state @xmath7 , respectively , and the @xmath22 function enforces energy conservation .    </S>",
    "<S> the main input in our calculations are the equivalent photon flux for a ultrarelativistic proton , @xmath23 , and the two photon partial decay widths , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> currently there are different models for the equivalent photon flux available in the literature ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general expression for the equivalent photon flux of an extended object is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum transfer from the projectile and @xmath26 its form factor . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath27 with @xmath28 the mass of the projectile . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the form factor cuts off the photon flux above @xmath29 gev@xmath30 . as its dependence on the photon virtuality </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath31 , the average virtuality is very small , which allow us to treat the processes as due to quasi - real photon photon collisions .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    considering only the electric dipole form factor for the proton , @xmath32gev@xmath33 , the following expression for the equivalent photon flux can be obtained @xmath34 \\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote this model by _ electric _ in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> if the term containing @xmath36 in eq . ( [ fluxgeral ] ) is disregarded , the equivalent photon spectrum of high energy protons is given as follow @xmath37\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression was derived originally by dress and zeppenfeld in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and will be denoted dz hereafter . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the author studied the effect of including the magnetic dipole moment and the corresponding magnetic form factor of the proton , obtaining a spectrum ( denoted _ electric + magnetic _ hereafter ) which is smaller than the dz one at small @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> another model considered in literature is the use of a minimum impact parameter , @xmath39 = 0.7 fm , in the photon energy spectrum produced by a point particle , which is given by @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are modified bessel functions and @xmath43 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we present a comparison between these different models for the photon flux . </S>",
    "<S> a basic characteristic of the distinct models for the photon spectrum is that they diminish with energy approximately like @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the photon spectrum is strongly peaked at low @xmath38 , so that the photon - photon center of mass energy , @xmath45 , is much smaller than the center of mass energy of the proton - proton system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the main contribution for the total cross section , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ totalcs ] ) comes from the small @xmath38 behaviour of the photon spectrum . in this region </S>",
    "<S> , the dz model predicts a larger photon flux . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the _ electric _ one , predicts the lower photon flux . </S>",
    "<S> the other two models , the _ electric + magnetic _ and @xmath39 = 0.7 fm models , predict intermediate values for the photon flux . at low @xmath38 ( @xmath46 ) </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the models is ever smaller than 20 % . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference increases at larger values of @xmath38 . at @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> the difference among the dz and _ electric _ models is @xmath48 25 % , increasing for @xmath48 100 % at @xmath49 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we will use the @xmath50 and @xmath51 photon fluxes in our calculations , which allow us to estimate the theoretical uncertainty in our predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> .cross sections for meson production at lhc energies considering the partial decay rates given by the particle data group @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     some comments are in order before the summary of our main results . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , meson production in two - photon interactions are clean events , with a final state characterized by two very forward protons , the meson ( or its decay products ) in the central detector and the presence of two rapidity gaps . </S>",
    "<S> two rapidity gaps in the final state also are generated in central exclusive processes ( cep ) by pomeron - pomeron interactions , where a pomeron ( @xmath52 ) is associated to a colorless object ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of meson production in @xmath53 interactions has been estimated in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in particular , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the central exclusive heavy quarkonia ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) production at the lhc has been studied in detail . in comparison with our predictions for @xmath56 production , </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in @xcite are at least three orders of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that the cep predictions describe the cdf data for the exclusive @xmath57 production @xcite . in the case of @xmath58 production , </S>",
    "<S> the cep predictions are a factor two larger . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we expect that for these final states the production to be dominated by @xmath53 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the production of light mesons in @xmath53 interactions still is an open question , since in this case the main contribution for the cross section comes from non - perturbative regime , which implies the use of phenomenological models in order to estimate the total cross section ( for some related studies see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath53 cross sections are strongly dependent on the treatment of the soft final states interactions and the associated survival probability . in contrast , the predictions for light meson production in @xmath4 interactions are much less sensitive to these effects . </S>",
    "<S> they are under theoretical control and can be considered a lower bound for the event rates of these final states . </S>",
    "<S> another aspect which we would like to comment is the experimental separation among @xmath53 and @xmath4 interactions . for both cases </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59-distribution is of the type @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the main distinction is associated to the slope @xmath61 which is almost 4 ( 40 ) gev@xmath62 for @xmath53 ( @xmath4 ) interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that photon - induced interactions take place larger impact parameters ( i.e. are less central ) than pomeron induced processes and , consequently , the exchanged squared momentum is smaller . as a consequence it is expected that the transverse momentum distribution of the scattered protons to be different @xmath4 and @xmath53 interactions , with the latter predicting large @xmath63 values . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation is corroborated by the results presented , for instance , in the refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the transverse momentum distribution has been quantified considering different final states . certainly , this subject deserves more detailed studies . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to emphasize that the atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located in a region away from the interaction point , which probably can eliminate many serious backgrounds .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , in this letter we estimated the the meson production in two - photon interactions at cern - lhc , which is characterized by two rapidity gaps in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained non - negligible values for the total cross sections , which implies that the experimental study is feasible . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that this process can be useful to test the glueball and hadronic molecule models . </S>"
