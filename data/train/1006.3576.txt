    "supernovae ( sne ) play a central role in astrophysics , not only as distance indicators for cosmology ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , but as prime synthesizers of heavy elements ( e.g. woosley 2007 ) , sources of kinetic energy , and accelerators of cosmic rays ( e.g. helder et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , many of the most basic facts about these events are still poorly understood .",
    "core - collapse ( cc ) sne are descended from massive stars , roughly in the range @xmath13 ( e.g. gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) , but the exact limits are not known , neither from theory nor from observation .",
    "it is not yet clear what are the physical parameters ( mass , binarity , rotation , magnetic field , and more ) that determine the variety of observed cc - sn subtypes ( iip , ib , ic , iin , iil ; see filippenko 1997 , for a review ) .",
    "type - ia sne ( sne  ia ) are linked by indirect evidence to the thermonuclear detonations of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) whose mass has grown to near the chandrasekhar limit ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) . however ,",
    "competing scenarios exist for the initial conditions and evolutionary paths that lead to this mass growth . in the single degenerate ( sd ) model",
    "( whelan & iben 1974 ) a wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion . in the double degenerate ( dd ) model ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) , two wds merge after losing energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves . in both scenarios ,",
    "many question remain regarding the ignition and development of the explosion itself .",
    "it is only recently that the relative and absolute rates of cc sne and sne  ia as a function of environment and cosmic time are starting to be measured accurately , and therefore the respective quantity , types , and times of their contributions to metal enrichment history are still poorly constrained .",
    "a fundamental function that could shed light on all of these issues is the sn delay time distribution ( dtd ) .",
    "the dtd is the hypothetical sn rate versus time that would follow a brief burst of star formation .",
    "the dtd is directly linked to the lifetimes ( i.e. , the initial masses ) of the progenitors and to the binary evolution timescales up to the explosion , and therefore different progenitor scenarios predict different dtds .",
    "furthermore , the dtds of different sn types dictate directly the mix of contributions of different sn types to metal enrichment throughout cosmic history .",
    "until recently , only few , and often - contradictory , observational constraints on the dtd existed .",
    "one observational approach has been to compare the sn rate in field galaxies , as a function of redshift , to the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) . given that the dtd is the sn `` response '' to a short burst of star formation , the sn rate versus cosmic time will be the convolution of the full sfh with the dtd .",
    "gal - yam & maoz ( 2004 ) carried out the first such comparison , using a small sample of sne  ia out to @xmath14 , and concluded that the results were strongly dependent on the poorly known cosmic sfh , a conclusion echoed by forster et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    with the availability of sn rate measurements to higher redshifts , barris & tonry ( 2006 ) found a sn  ia rate that closely tracks the sfh out to @xmath15 , and concluded that the dtd must be concentrated at short delays , @xmath16  gyr .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached , at least out to @xmath17 , by sullivan et al .",
    "in contrast , dahlen et al . ( 2004 , 2008 ) and strolger ( 2004 ) have argued for a dtd that is peaked at a delay of @xmath18  gyr , with little power at short delays , based on a decrease in the sn  ia rate at @xmath19 .",
    "however , kuznetzova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have re - analyzed some of these datasets and concluded that the small numbers of sne and their potential classification errors preclude reaching a conclusion .",
    "similarly , poznanski et al . (",
    "2007 ) performed new measurements of the @xmath19 sn  ia rate , and found that , within uncertainties , the sn rate could be tracking the sfh .",
    "this , again , would imply a short delay time .",
    "greggio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) pointed out that underestimated extinction of the highest-@xmath8 sne , observed in their rest - frame ultraviolet emission , could be an additional factor affecting these results .    a second approach to recovering the dtd has been to compare the sn rates in galaxy populations of different characteristic ages . using this approach , mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , scannapieco & bildsten ( 2005 ) , and sullivan ( 2006 ) all found evidence for the co - existence of two sn  ia populations , a `` prompt '' population that explodes within @xmath20  myr , and a delayed channel that produces sne  ia on timescales of order 5  gyr .",
    "naturally , these two `` channels '' may in reality be just integrals over a continuous dtd on two sides of some time border ( greggio et al .",
    "totani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have used a similar approach to recover the dtd , by comparing sn  ia rates in early - type galaxies of different characteristic ages , seen at @xmath21 as part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) project .",
    "they find a dtd consistent with a @xmath22 form , which is roughly generic for dd models ( e.g. greggio 2005 ; see  [ sspowerlawdtd ] , below ) .",
    "additional recent attempts to address the issue with the `` rate vs. age '' approach have been made by aubourg et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , raskin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , yasuda & fukugita ( 2009 ) , and cooper et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "both of the above approaches involve averaging , and hence some loss of information . in the first approach , one averages over large galaxy populations , by associating all of the sne detected at a given redshift with all the galaxies of a particular type at that redshift . in the second approach , a characteristic age for a sample of galaxies",
    "replaces the detailed sfh of the individual galaxies in a sn survey .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently presented a method for recovering the dtd , which avoids this averaging . in the method ,",
    "the sfh of every individual galaxy , or even galaxy subunit , is compared to the number of sne it hosted in the survey ( generally none , sometimes one , rarely more ) .",
    "dtd recovery is treated as a linearized inverse problem , which is solved statistically .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) applied the method to a subsample of the galaxies in the lick observatory sn search ( filippenko et al .",
    "2010 ; leaman et al . 2010",
    "; li et al .",
    "2010a , b ) , having sfh reconstructions by tojeiro et al . ( 2009 ) based on data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al , 2000 ) .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find a significant detection of both a prompt sn  ia component , that explodes within 420  myr of star formation , and a delayed sn  ia with population that explodes after @xmath23  gyr .",
    "maoz & badenes ( 2010 ) applied this method also to a sample of sn remnants in the magellanic clouds , compiled by badenes , maoz , & draine ( 2010 ) . treating the remnants as an effective sn survey conducted over @xmath24  kyr",
    ", they also find a significant detection of a prompt ( this time @xmath25  myr ) sn  ia component .",
    "a related dtd reconstruction method has been applied by brandt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to the sne  ia from the sdss ii survey . like maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , they detect both a prompt and a delayed sn  ia population .",
    "yet another approach for recovering the dtd , which is at the focus of this paper , is to measure the sn rate vs. redshift in massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the deep potential wells of clusters , combined with their relatively simple sfhs , make them ideal locations for studying both the dtd and the metal production of sne .",
    "optical spectroscopy and multiwavelength photometry of cluster galaxies has shown consistently that the bulk of their stars were formed within short episodes ( @xmath26  myr ) at @xmath27 ( e.g. , daddi et al . 2000 ; stanford et al . 2005 ; eisenhardt et al .",
    "thus , the observed sn rate vs. the elapsed cosmic time since the stellar formation epoch provides an almost ( see  [ sscomparisontopred ] ) direct measurement of the form of the dtd .",
    "furthermore , the record of metals stored in the intracluster medium ( icm ) constrains the number of sne that have exploded , and hence the normalization of the dtd .",
    "renzini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and renzini ( 1997 ) first pointed out that the large mass of iron in the icm could not have been produced solely by cc sne from a stellar population with a standard initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "either a `` top - heavy '' imf , or a dominant contribution by sne  ia is required .",
    "maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) revisited the problem , and tested the hypothesis that the main source of iron is sne  ia .",
    "accounting for the cc  sn contribution to the observed iron mass , they calculated the number of sne  ia , per present - day stellar luminosity , needed to have exploded over the entire past history of a cluster , in order to produce the observed iron mass .",
    "finally , they compared some simple theoretical dtds , normalized to produce this number of sne , to the then - available cluster sn  ia rates ( gal - yam , maoz , & sharon 2002 ; reiss 2000 ) .",
    "the low observed sn  ia rates out to @xmath15 implied that the large number of events , needed to produce the bulk of the iron , occurred at even higher redshifts , beyond the range of the then - existing observations .",
    "maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) therefore concluded that sne  ia can be the main source of iron only if most of them explode during the relatively brief time interval between star formation in massive clusters ( at @xmath28 ) and the highest - redshift cluster sn rate measurements ( at @xmath15 ) .",
    "in other words , the majority of sne ia ( at least those that occur in a galaxy cluster environment ) must have a short time delay , @xmath29gyr .",
    "a shortcoming of the work by maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) was the paucity and quality of the cluster sn rate data it was based on .",
    "the low-@xmath8 cluster sn rate by reiss ( 2000 ) was never published in the refereed literature .",
    "the cluster sn rates at @xmath30 by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , were based on very few events  two or three  discovered in archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "wfpc2 images of clusters .",
    "the large poisson and systematic uncertainties in the resulting rates precluded any detailed discrimination among model dtds .    over the past few years",
    ", the observational situation has improved dramatically .",
    "accurate cluster sn  ia rates have been measured in the redshift range of 0 to 1.5 , with smaller errors than the previous sole published study at @xmath31 by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in this paper",
    ", we utilize this wealth of new measurements for a renewed analysis of the cluster sn rate and its implications for the sn  ia dtd and for cluster metal - enrichment history .",
    "we show that the new data permit a direct comparison of the observations with the functional behavior of various dtds that have been proposed in the literature , whether parametrized - mathematical or phenomenological dtds , or dtds resulting from physical considerations at different levels of sophistication .",
    "we find that few of these models , in their simplest forms , are compatible with the emerging observational picture , and therefore we have reached the point where the observations discriminate among models . in  2 , below , we compile the existing cluster sn  ia measurements . in  3 , we review the existing measurements of the properties of clusters , particularly the gas - to - stellar mass ratio , that are relevant for estimating the present - day cluster iron - to - stellar mass ratio .",
    "this ratio , in turn , sets the number of sn  ia that have exploded in clusters , per unit stellar mass formed , which then fixes the normalization of the dtd . in ",
    "4 we use the rates and the normalization to recover the observational dtd . we take a forward - modeling approach starting in  5 , where we compare the observed rates to the dtd predictions of various `` single - component '' models that invoke a single mathematical form or physical progenitor formation channel . in  [ ss.noninst ] , we relax the assumption of a single , instantaneous , star - formation episode in clusters , and examine whether an extended star - formation history , combined with some single dtd , can reproduce the measurements . in  7 , we examine the ability of composite models , which mix diverse dtds , or multiple episodes of star formation , to match the observations .",
    "we summarize our results in  8 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 km s@xmath35 mpc@xmath35 .",
    "to perform our analysis , we first compile the cluster sn  ia rate measurements currently in existence .",

    "the mean redshifts are visibility - time - weighted means for the clusters monitored by each survey , i.e. , in the calculation of the mean , the redshift of each cluster in the survey sample is weighted by the effective time during which a sn  ia would have been visible in the survey ( see , e.g. , sharon et al . 2007 ) . before these recent measurements ,",

    "( 2010 ) , and now further suggested by the results above , the integral over the sn  ia rate from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , times the mean iron yield of sne  ia ( @xmath95 ; see below ) , gives just a small fraction , roughly 10% , of the present - day ratio of iron mass to stellar mass observed in clusters .",
    "it is then unavoidable that the large majority of cluster metals were produced within the first 1 - 2  gyrs after the formation of the cluster stars .",
    "the metals were produced by cc sne and perhaps by `` prompt '' sne  ia , but they were not produced by any sne with a larger delay , as the rate measurements show that only few such explosions took place at those later times .    in order to juxtapose the new cluster rates , compiled above , with model expectations , we revisit the question of the iron - to - stellar mass ratio in clusters , which dictates the normalization of the dtd .",
    "in addition to considering the latest data on cluster properties , our treatment will differ from the one in maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) in several respects , most notably in that we will use mass - normalized , rather than luminosity - normalized sn rates , and we will account for mass evolution due to stellar mass loss .",
    "stellar mass is , of course , more closely related to the number of stars than is blue luminosity , and is a more stable quantity .",
    "the mass of iron in clusters that is attributable to sne  ia is the sum of the iron masses in the icm and in stars , minus the mass of iron produced by cc  sne .",

    "another approach to making dtd predictions , followed by greggio ( 2005 ) , is to calculate analytical dtd models , based on stellar evolution arguments and on various parametrizations of the possible results of the complex common - envelope phases through which sn  ia progenitor systems must pass . for each of several sn  ia channels , she calculated the dtds that emerge when varying the values for the parameters describing the initial conditions , and the mass and separation distributions and limits of the systems that eventually explode .",

    "thus , only the two dd - close greggio ( 2005 ) models are consistent with the rates and the iron data .",
    "this is simply the result of the fact that dd models generically produce power - law dtds , and the power - laws required to fit simultaneously the observed rates and the normalizations need to have indices of @xmath297 or steeper .",
    "such indices can be obtained by emerging from the common - envelope phase with a steep power - law separation distribution , i.e. , with relatively more close pairs , as discussed in  [ sspowerlawdtd ] and seen in eq .",

    "naturally , we have examined a limited range of the greggio ( 2005 ) models , and it would be interesting to see if there are others ( e.g. greggio 2010 ) that do fit the data , and what are their parameters .",

    "this , in turn , means that a smaller fraction of the time - integrated sn number , dictated by the iron abundances , can be produced at early times . raising the model normalization , such that the iron constraints are met",
    ", then results in a poor fit to the sn rate data , compared to the instantaneous case . to try to mitigate this effect",
    ", we shift back by 1  gyr the time of initial star formation to @xmath302  gyr , corresponding to @xmath303 . nonetheless , in every case , the fit with an extended sfh is worse than in the case of an instantaneous burst .",
    "these results are illustrated with two examples .",
    "figure  [ figplsfhexp ] shows the predictions of a minimal - iron - normalized @xmath236 power - law dtd , with the exponential sfh starting at @xmath303 , and several characteristic exponential times @xmath304 .",
    "also shown , for comparison , is the @xmath191 instantaneous burst , shown before in fig  [ figplm1 ] . at late times , all the predictions have similar slopes , while at progressively shorter times , the rate dependence is shallower for the more extended sfhs .",
    "this leads to progressively greater overprediction of the observed rates .",
    "formally , @xmath305  gyr is ruled out , based on @xmath306 .",
    "conversely , if we ignore the iron constraints and find the best - fit normalization , then the integrated number of sne  ia is significantly lower than required by the minimal constraint ( e.g. , by a factor 2 , for @xmath307  gyr ) . in fig .",
    "[ figyungsfhexp ] , we show the same exercise for the sg - eld model of yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) . it might have been hoped that the convolution with an extended sfh could moderate the steep fall at late delays of this dtd , and thus provide a better fit to the observed weak time dependence of the rates . although the steep fall , predicted in the instantaneous burst case , is indeed moderated , the smoothing at short delays lowers the contribution from early times to the integrated sn numbers , forcing a higher overall normalization and a poor fit .    to summarize this section , the moderate slope of the observed sn rate redshift dependence at @xmath308 . , combined with the large time - integrated number of sne  ia indicated by the iron abundance , together call for a dtd that is sharply peaked at short delays , but with a low tail out to long delays .",
    "convolution of any of the few single - dtd models that satisfy these constraints with any simple sfh that is extended on timescales @xmath309  gyr only degrades the fits .",
    "we now examine to what degree the challenges of reproducing the observations can be overcome by the addition of free parameters that is implicit in the combination of multiple components  either two dtds ( as could be expected from the co - existence of two distinct physical sn  ia channels , e.g. , dd and sd ) , or two components of cluster sfh , as opposed to the single bursts assumed so far .",
    "the idea of two co - existing sn  ia channels , prompt and delayed , emerged several years ago from the observation of , on the one hand , a proportionality between star - formation rate ( sfr ) and sn  ia rate per unit stellar mass in star forming galaxies , and on the other hand , a non - zero sn  ia rate in early - type galaxies with no current star formation ( mannucci et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ) . as noted in  [ ss.intro ] , this observation does not necessarily imply the existence of two separate physical channels .",
    "instead , it could be the manifestation of a dtd from a single channel but with delays spread over a wide range of timescales .",
    "indeed , our analysis , above , shows that single parametrized dtds of power - law form , with indices somewhat steeper than @xmath213 can match the observational constraints ( as can some dd models that produce dtds of this type , if they are suitably scaled up ) .",
    "however , some of the other theoretical dtds , that individually are incompatible with the data because they predict no delayed sne , can be `` saved '' by incorporating them into a two - channel picture .",
    "for example , two of the models of yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) , he - eld and the sg - ch , predict no sne at long time delays .",
    "figure  [ figheeldpdd ] shows the predicted cluster rates from the combination of the he - eld model and the dd model , discussed in   [ ss.yungel ] .",
    "the raw sum of these two models , as before , produces a too - small fraction ( less than half ) of the total number of sne  ia indicated by the minimal iron constraint , and underpredicts all the sn rates below @xmath310 ( by a factor of 5 ) .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figheeldpdd ] , scaling up this composite dtd by factors of 2.1 or 3.6 can solve these problems for the minimal and optical iron cases , respectively . in this example , 60% of the sne ( and the iron ) are from the prompt he - eld sd component , and the rest from the dd component .",
    "similar combinations of two components can work using the other dtds we have considered , as long as one of the components is a dd model ( or a similar power law ) that can provide the sne with long delays .",
    "in addition to the choice of components , one can choose the relative scaling between them , providing a further adjustable parameter .",
    "the current data of course can not discriminate between the various possible prompt components as they make their contributions beyond the redshifts at which rate measurements exist .",
    "our experiments at combining different dtd are obviously not exhaustive , but the emerging picture is nonetheless clear .",
    "the observed sn rates and the iron mass in clusters can be explained simultaneously by combining `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' dtds .",
    "the sne  ia from the prompt component produce the majority of the iron mass in clusters .",
    "the sne from the delayed component produce only a fraction of the metals , and they are the events detected by current sn rate measurements , with their weak time dependence .",

    "sne  ia in all early types , whether in the field or in clusters , and at low or high redshifts , would be the prompt outcome of low levels of recent but unseen star - formation in these galaxies .",
    "however , a study by foerster & schawinski ( 2008 ) of the early - type hosts of sne  ia argues against this possibility .",
    "furthermore , the dtd reconstruction in nearby galaxies by maoz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) demonstrates a @xmath329 detection of a delayed sn  ia component , with delays of @xmath330  gyr .",
    "we therefore conclude that the scenario of a burst+constant sfh , combined with a prompt single - component dtd , is probably not a viable model .",
    "while it is capable of explaining the cluster sn rate data and the observed iron to stellar mass ratio , it is incompatible with other cluster observations .",
    "those observations indicate that , although about 10% of the stellar mass of clusters formed at @xmath331 , this activity did not occur in the central , quiescent , galaxies hosting the sne found by current surveys , and that the sfr falls steeply with cosmic time , in contrast to the flat sfh required to reproduce , under this scenario , the flat observed sn rate .",
    "measurements of galaxy - cluster sn  ia rates as a function of cosmic time provide a particularly direct avenue to obtain the dtd of sne  ia , with its implications for progenitor models and cosmic history .",

    "we have combined recently completed measurements of cluster rates between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the latest results on the iron mass content of clusters , to recover the sn  ia dtd , and to test a variety of model dtds , from purely mathematical parametrized forms , to dtds obtained from more detailed physical considerations .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "+ 1 . assuming that the bulk of the stars in clusters formed with a normal imf in a brief burst at @xmath94 , as indicated by optical spectroscopy of cluster galaxies , the sn  ia dtd can be directly recovered from the observations .",
    "the resulting dtd peaks at the shortest delays probed , @xmath3  gyr , decreases steeply at longer delays , and extends out to 11  gyr .",
    "the recovered dtd agrees remarkably well , both in shape and in absolute normalization , with dtds recently recovered using different techniques , in different environments : in field ellipticals ( totani et al .",
    "2008 ) ; in nearby galaxies ( maoz et al .",
    "2010 ) ; and in the magellanic clouds ( maoz & badenes 2010 ) .",
    "the current derivation is complementary to previous ones in that it recovers the dtd over its full time range , with good time resolution at delays @xmath332  gyr .",
    "the emerging picture is of a universal dtd that is not strongly dependent on environment or cosmic time , and can be well represented by a single power law , of index @xmath333 .",
    "+ 2 . comparing the data to theoretical or phenomenological dtds in a forward - modeling process , the best parametric description of the dtd is a power law , @xmath334 with index @xmath335 or @xmath336 , depending on whether we adopt a minimal - iron constraint or an optimal - iron constraint , respectively , based on cluster data .",
    "single - component dtds consisting of shallower power laws , such @xmath246 , can not simultaneously match the observed sn rates and the integrated sn  ia numbers dictated by the iron - to - stellar mass ratio .",
    "physical dd models from the bps simulations we have examined can match the observations , provided they are scaled up in numbers by factors of @xmath287 . on the other hand , sd models , on their own , fail because they do not produce sne at late delays , as implied by the data .",
    "our results thus provide strong support for the double - degenerate sn  ia progenitor scenario .",
    "the above conclusions are insensitive to the exact epoch of star formation in clusters , in the range @xmath337 .",
    "the conclusions also do not change if one replaces the instantaneous starburst with an exponentially decaying sfh , except that the model fits deteriorate with increasing star - formation timescale , and so the range of acceptable models shrinks .",
    "multi - component models , that either combine freely scaled versions of two dtds ( e.g. sd and dd ) , or two sfh models ( such as a burst plus a constant ) with a prompt dtd , have enough freedom to permit many combinations that can match the existing data .",
    "however , apart from the loss of simplicity involved , such combinations face other problems . for the composite dtd models , it remains to be seen if the required combinations and scalings are physically plausible . for the composite sfhs , a high sfr in the central regions of clusters , and which remains constant between @xmath12 ,",

    "all of the successful dtd models produce just a fraction of the time - integrated numbers of sne  ia at redshifts below 1.4 .",
    "a clear prediction of these models is , therefore , that sn surveys of clusters or proto - clusters at even higher redshifts , approaching the stellar formation redshifts of the clusters , should reveal a sharply rising rate of sne  ia .",

    "<S> knowledge of the supernova ( sn ) delay time distribution ( dtd )  the sn rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation  can shed light on sn progenitors and physics , as well as on the timescales of chemical enrichment in different environments . </S>",
    "<S> we compile recent measurements of the type - ia sn ( sn  ia ) rate in galaxy clusters at redshifts from @xmath0 out to @xmath1 , just 2  gyr after cluster star formation at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we review the plausible range for the observed total iron - to - stellar mass ratio in clusters , based on the latest data and analyses , and use it to constrain the time - integrated number of sn  ia events in clusters . with these data , </S>",
    "<S> we recover the dtd of sne  ia in cluster environments . </S>",
    "<S> the dtd is sharply peaked at the shortest time - delay interval we probe , @xmath3  gyr , with a low tail out to delays of @xmath4  gyr , and is remarkably consistent with several recent dtd reconstructions based on different methods , applied to different environments . </S>",
    "<S> we test dtd models from the literature , requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster sn rates and the observed iron - to - stellar mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> a parametrized power - law dtd of the form @xmath5 from @xmath6  myr to a hubble time , can satisfy both constraints . </S>",
    "<S> shallower power laws , such as @xmath7 can not , assuming a single dtd , and a single star - formation burst ( either brief or extended ) at high @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies 5085% of sne  ia explode within 1  gyr of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> dtds from double - degenerate ( dd ) models , which generically have @xmath9 shapes over a wide range of timescales , match the data , but only if their predictions are scaled up by factors of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> single degenerate ( sd ) dtds always give poor fits to the data , due to a lack of delayed sne and overall low numbers of sne . </S>",
    "<S> the observations can also be reproduced with a combination of two sn  ia populations  a prompt sd population of sne  ia that explodes within a few gyr of star formation , and produces about 60 percent of the iron mass in clusters , and a dd population that contributes the events seen at @xmath11 an alternative scenario of a single , prompt , sn  ia population , but a composite star - formation history in clusters , consisting of a burst at high @xmath8 , followed by a constant star - formation rate , can reproduce the sn rates , but is at odds with direct measurements of star formation in clusters at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the existence of a dd progenitor channel for sne  ia , if the overall predicted numbers can be suitably increased . </S>"
