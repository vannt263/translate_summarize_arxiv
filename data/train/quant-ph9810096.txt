    "the magnetic trapping and forced evaporative cooling of alkali metal vapors has lead to the bose - einstein condensation of a number of different atomic species @xcite . as a consequence , the many - body physics of confined , weakly interacting bose gases are now amenable to experimental investigation . to date most experimental and theoretical research on degenerate atomic gases has focused on bosons @xcite .",
    "recently , some exotic systems have been investigated experimentally , these include the bose condensation of spin mixtures of @xmath0rb using sympathetic cooling @xcite , and a report of spin domains of @xmath1na in an optical trap @xcite .",
    "there is now a growing interest in the properties of degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite and boson - fermion mixtures @xcite , although to date a degenerate atomic fermi gas has not been achieved .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the process of sympathetic cooling of an initially non - degenerate fermi gas to the quantum degenerate regime using a bose gas as coolant .",
    "sympathetic cooling of a fermi gas to degeneracy is necessary as a result of the suppression of s - wave scattering between identical fermions in spin symmetric states .",
    "evaporative cooling of a pure fermion gas trapped in a single hyperfine state , which depends on rethermalization through atomic collisions , is thus ineffective at temperatures sufficiently low that only the lowest few partial waves contribute .",
    "the fermi gas may instead be cooled by thermal contact with a cold bose gas , which may be either already condensed before thermal contact with the fermi gas , or evaporatively cooled in its presence .",
    "we investigate the dynamics using the quantum boltzmann equation ( qbe ) for the bose - fermi gas mixture .",
    "the qbe has been applied to describe the population dynamics for a bose gas by a number of authors who solved it by direct integration @xcite , trajectory simulation @xcite , and bird s simulation method @xcite .",
    "the first two sets of authors make the assumption that the distribution is ergodic at all times @xcite to simplify the numerical computation , whereas in bird s method collision dynamics are constructed from simulated particle trajectories . in this paper",
    "we solve the qbe in the ergodic approximation by direct integration of the coupled differential equations which describe the fermi and bose gas distribution functions .",
    "we consider an harmonically trapped gas of @xmath2 fermions with fermi temperature given by @xmath3 , which is in thermal contact with a similarly confined gas of @xmath4 bosons with condensation temperature @xmath5 . by evaporatively cooling the bose gas through @xmath6 down to a temperature @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the fermi gas will equilibrate to the fermi temperature provided @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of condensed atoms remaining .",
    "solution of the qbe gives both the energy and spatial distributions of the bose and fermi gases .",
    "an important limitation of our present treatment is the neglect of mean field effects on the dynamics .",
    "these are potentially important when the bose and fermi gas are degenerate and the mean field energy exceeds the trap frequency . in a recent paper mlmer @xcite has used a simple mean field model to study the spatial distributions of a bose - fermi gas mixture at @xmath11 .",
    "the distributions depend strongly on the relative sign and magnitude of the boson - boson and boson - fermion scattering lengths . a complete and numerically tractable approach to quantum kinetics which incorporates such mean field effects in addition to the population dynamics ,",
    "is still under investigation . a qualitative discussion of the influence of mean field effects on our results is given in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we discuss the equilibrium temperatures for an initially hot fermi gas placed in thermal contact with a cold bose gas .",
    "we also derive a simple dynamical model for the thermalization using the assumption that both gases are described by a maxwell boltzmann distribution at all times . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe a theoretical model based on the qbe for the fermi - bose mixture and the treatment of forced evaporative cooling . in section  [ sec3 ] we present results of solutions of the qbe which provide information on the kinetic temperature and spatial distributions of the mixture . using recent atomic data we also present some results for the sympathetic cooling of the @xmath12k/@xmath13k fermi / bose potassium isotopes .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "if two gases at different initial temperatures are brought into contact they will rethermalize to a common equilibrium temperature which can be obtained using conservation of particle number and energy ( over bar indicates average energy ) @xmath14 assuming that there are no losses during relaxation . for a bose - fermi gas mixture",
    "the equilibrium temperature @xmath15 can be found numerically using the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distribution functions as follows .",
    "given the number of bosons @xmath4 , and fermions @xmath2 , and the initial temperatures @xmath16 , @xmath17 we set @xmath18 at each iteration step and compute the fugacity @xmath19 for the fermi gas by solving @xmath20 with @xmath21 the degeneracy of states with energy @xmath22 .",
    "we then compute the mean energy @xmath23 for the fermi gas and determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the bose gas by the following iteration : set @xmath26 and compute @xmath24 from @xmath27 then compute @xmath25 by solving @xmath28 and repeat this iteration until @xmath29/n_b<10^{-7}$ ] and @xmath30/\\bar\\epsilon_b<10^{-7}$ ] .",
    "we then set @xmath18 and repeat the procedure until @xmath31 .    for temperatures @xmath32 and @xmath33 an approximate equation",
    "can be obtained using a classical maxwell boltzmann distribution for the fermi gas and a bose distribution with @xmath34 for the bose gas .",
    "this yields @xmath35 with the bose - einstein function @xmath36 . if @xmath37 we can approximate the bose - einstein distribution with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution to obtain an explicit expression for the temperature @xmath38 in fig . [ fig0 ] we show the equilibrium temperature as a function of the initial fermi gas temperature scaled in units of @xmath39 .",
    "the bose gas consists of @xmath40 atoms at initial temperature @xmath41 , where @xmath39 depends on the number of fermions which is varied between @xmath42 and @xmath40 . in terms of the bec temperature",
    "the initial temperature of the bose gas lies in the range @xmath43 .",
    "the full numerical results agree well with approximation eq .",
    "( [ approxt1 ] ) for @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the temperature range considered .",
    "this is shown by the curves at the bottom of the figure which almost overlap the approximate solution .",
    "the equilibrium temperature @xmath15 stays below the critical temperature @xmath6 and in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ approxt1 ] ) @xmath46 does not depend on the number of fermions .",
    "if we increase the number of fermions or alternatively the initial fermi gas temperature , the bose gas will be heated above @xmath6 and the equilibrium temperature shows the linear dependence on @xmath17 as derived in  ( [ approxt2 ] ) . from our numerical studies we find that fermi statistics become significant only for @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) , which in general can be reached with additional evaporative cooling of the gas mixture .",
    "we consider bose and fermi gases brought into thermal contact in a confining potential , at different initial temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we are primarily interested here in a regime prior to a stage of forced evaporative cooling , in which the bose gas as well as the fermi gas is non - degenerate .",
    "the thermalization may result in a significant alteration in the energy and spatial distribution of fermionic atoms in the trap .",
    "a simple dynamical description of the thermalization can be derived using the classical boltzmann equation in the ergodic approximation .",
    "the mean energy of component @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ergodic distribution function for component @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the density of states for an harmonic trap of mean frequency @xmath53 . for simplicity we asssume that both components see the same trapping potential .",
    "the time dependence of the energy of the fermi gas is then obtained by integrating the boltzmann equation @xcite over all energies @xmath54,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all energies written with upper case e are dimensionless , i.e , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and the natural timescale @xmath57 is given in terms of the bose - fermi _",
    "s_-wave collision cross section @xmath58 by @xmath59 .",
    "we have dropped the term which represents collisions between fermionic atoms assuming that the _ p_-wave contribution is neglibible at the low energies under consideration .",
    "to get some qualitative insight into the thermalization dynamics we need to further simplify the model .",
    "we assume that the component distribution functions are boltzmann - like at all times , and parametrized by time dependent fugacity @xmath60 and dimensionless temperature @xmath61 as follows , @xmath62 = z_k(t ) e^{-e/\\bar t_k(t)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the average energy and particle number for a trapped maxwell - boltzmann distribution are given by @xmath63 from which it follows that @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the fugacity of component @xmath51 can therefore be eliminated in terms of the particle number and mean energy .",
    "another simplification which results from the approximation is that the scattering of two bosons does not alter the average energy of the bose gas .",
    "it is convenient to write the average energy in terms of a dimensionless temperature , thus @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and the rational function @xmath68 the equilibrium temperature @xmath69 is obtained from @xmath70 . integrating from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ,",
    "we recover equation  ( [ approxt2 ] ) .",
    "the analysis shows that the timescale for relaxation is approximately @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the predictions of this simple dynamical model , with the full dynamics of the qbe as discussed in the following section .",
    "the solutions show that the time scale that describes equilibration is on the order of @xmath74 , as predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ tf ] ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "if forced evaporative cooling is applied to the gas mixture , atoms from the hot energy tail are removed .",
    "the rate of evaporation must be chosen to be much smaller than the relaxation rate of the gas as discussed above . another way to determine",
    "the relaxation time is to calculate the initial mean collision rate @xmath75 using the boltzmann collision integral .",

    "one sums over all initial energies @xmath76 , and divides by the number of particles to get the energy averaged rate per particle @xmath80 in qualitative agreement with the simple model above .",
    "we note , however , that the relaxation rate we have discussed here should not be regarded as the characteristic time scale for condensation @xcite .",
    "the qbe for a harmonically confined bose gas has been discussed elsewhere within the ergodic approximation @xcite .",

    "the collision matrix elements are approximately given by @xmath87 with @xmath88 the degeneracy of energy level @xmath86 , and @xmath89 is the minimum energy of all four energies involved in the scattering process , as defined earlier .",
    "although this approximation is not quantitatively accurate for the lowest several states of the trap , it is sufficient to illustrate the main qualitative features of sympathetic cooling . in an isotropic trap",
    "the degeneracy of the energy state @xmath90 , is @xmath91 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 , give the ratios of the cross sections for boson - boson and fermion - fermion scattering , respectively , to the boson - fermion cross section .",
    "exchange symmetry leads to @xmath94 since the _",
    "s_-wave cross section vanishes for identical fermions . of course , this is the reason we must employ sympathetic cooling with a bose gas refrigerant .",
    "evaporative cooling in magnetic traps is performed by inducing transitions to untrapped states with a radio - frequency field .",
    "this is modeled here by the following procedure .",
    "particles that are scattered into states with energy larger than the time varying cut - off energy @xmath95 are lost .",
    "the latter is a given decreasing function of time in the case of forced evaporative cooling .",
    "a particle may be scattered into a state with energy @xmath96 , by two - body scattering of atoms in states with energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 , in which @xmath100 , so that one particle is lost from the trap .",
    "similarly a particle in energy level @xmath101 can be scattered out of this energy level , @xmath102 , resulting in one particle loss from the trap when either @xmath103 , or @xmath104 .",

    "in this section we illustrate the dynamics of sympathetic cooling of bose - fermi gas mixtures , through their energy , state and spatial distribution functions .",
    "the spatial distributions of confined degenerate bose and fermi atomic gases are quite different .",
    "an ideal bose condensate has a size determined by the quantum width of the trap ground state @xmath111 , whereas the size of a fermi gas is governed by the fermi width @xmath112 , which scales as @xmath113 , as a result of the pauli exclusion principle . for an interacting bose gas , with positive scattering length ,",

    "these may be important in the final stages of cooling if the bose gas is already strongly condensed at this stage .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we present the rethermalization of a non - degenerate fermi gas immediately after it is placed in thermal contact with a bose gas which is initially at the bose condensation temperature @xmath6 .",

    "the gas then equilibrates to a non - degenerate state as can be seen from inspection of the peak of the spatial distribution function , @xmath118 , @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] compares the simple model of thermalization discussed in the last section with the qbe .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we consider the forced evaporative cooling of both gases .",
    "in contrast to figs . [ fig1 ] and",
    "[ fig2 ] there are @xmath45 bosons and @xmath42 fermions , initially .",
    "the forced cooling begins after the initial equilibration stage during which the boson temperature increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , following thermal contact of the two gases .",
    "the evaporative cooling time scale is chosen to be @xmath57 , which is much longer than both the relaxation time scale of the one component bose gas [ eq .",
    "( [ scatter ] ) ] and the relaxation time scale of the fermi gas with the bose gas [ eq .",
    "( [ tf ] ) ] .",
    "the bose gas energy distribution shows the formation of the condensate and the corresponding spatial distribution contracts to that of the condensate with a small thermal component .",
    "the degenerate fermi gas is then exposed and its spatial distribution is close to the zero temperature limit [ eq .  ( [ nrf ] ) ] which has a maximum density at the trap center @xmath119 .",
    "the inset shows the state occupancy for the fermi distribution with the characteristic smearing of the fermi surface at finite temperature , and near unit occupancy for low lying levels .",
    "it is interesting to note that evaporative cooling of the fermi gas still proceeds at later times when the spatial overlap between fermions and bosons is mainly in a small region at the center of the trap where the condensate is located .",
    "the collisions which result in cooling involve orbits of hot fermions through the trap center where they collide with cold condensed bosons . at this stage evaporation",
    "mainly results in depletion of fermions as can be seen in fig .",
    "we also simulate the case when the evaporative cooling involves only the loss of bose atoms from the trap .",

    "[ fig6 ] we consider the same initial conditions as for figs . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , but only ramp down the cut - off energy for the bosons .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same as in the former case where both bose and fermi gas particles evaporate , except that we end up with more particles left in the fermi gas . as mentioned earlier we have not included the effect of the bosonic mean field which can alter the spatial distributions of each component depending on the mean field strength , the ratio of the scattering lengths , and the particle numbers of both components @xcite .",
    "a possible experimental scenario for sympathetic cooling of a bose - fermi mixture involves two isotopes of potassium .",
    "recent calculations predict the _ s_-wave scattering length for the bosonic isotope @xmath13k to be @xmath120 ( nm ) with corresponding cross section @xmath121 and the _ s_-wave scattering length between @xmath13k and the fermionic isotope @xmath12k to be @xmath122 ( nm ) with cross section @xmath123 @xcite . using @xmath124 and @xmath125(hz )",
    "sets the time scale @xmath126(min ) .",

    "the density profile of an ideal bose gas is almost gaussian and the mean density of the ground state becomes @xmath129 .",
    "the ratio of the mean field strength to the trap energy is then @xmath130 further discussions of the influence of mean - field effects on our results is given below . in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we present an example of evaporative cooling for a spin polarized @xmath131k mixture of @xmath40 bosons and @xmath45 fermions at initial temperatures @xmath132 ( @xmath133k ) and @xmath134 ( @xmath133k ) and cut - off energy @xmath135 .",
    "we estimate the boson scattering rate using eq .",
    "( [ scatter ] ) which yields @xmath136 . from @xmath137 until @xmath138 the cut - off energy remains at @xmath139 . during the thermalization the bose distribution completely envelopes the fermi distribution which deviates significantly from its equilibrium distribution .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the number of fermions almost remains the same whereas a large number of bosons are evaporated .",
    "after @xmath138 the cut - off energy is ramped down exponentially with rate @xmath140 until @xmath141 ( s ) . at the early stages of the forced evaporation",
    "the number of bosons decreases until most of the bosons are in the condensate and evaporation mainly leads to depletion of fermions .",
    "the simulation shows that the fermi gas can be cooled to a temperature @xmath142 with more than @xmath143 fermions left in the trap .    in practice",
    "there are some additional issues that must be considered .",
    "the isotopes have different mass and magnetic moment , this means that in general the clouds will be displaced with respect to one another due to the combined effects of gravity and the magnetic trapping force @xcite .",
    "sympathetic cooling can only proceed efficiently if good overlap between the gases is maintained @xcite .",
    "even if we assume this has been achieved , the difference in magnetic moments will cause the trap frequencies to be different for the bose and fermi gas .",
    "for example if the bosonic @xmath13k ( @xmath144 , where i is the nuclear spin ) is polarized in the state @xmath145 , and the fermion isotope @xmath12k ( @xmath146 ) is polarized in the state @xmath147 , the trap frequencies would be in the ratio of @xmath148 . in our calculation",
    "we assume the trap frequencies and masses to be identical .",
    "for degenerate bose and fermi gases mean field effects can strongly influence the spatial distributions . here",
    "we discuss how these effects qualitatively change the stationary distributions presented above , using the zero temperature model discussed by mlmer @xcite . if the number of bosons is much larger than the number of fermions then as @xmath149 increases relative to @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , the fermion distribution is displaced further and further outside of the central core of the trap occupied by the bosons . when the particle numbers are similar the bosons are displaced outside the fermion region in the same limit .",
    "on the other hand , for large negative fermion - boson scattering length the stationary distributions may be unstable and dynamically change as a result . in the latter case mean",
    "field effects qualitatively change the nature of the problem , and thus our results will not apply .    in our simulations",
    "the number of bosons is always much larger than the number of fermions . in this case",
    "we can to first order neglect the influence of the fermions on the the boson spatial distribution .",

    "the corresponding spatial distribution of fermions can be found from the equation @xcite @xmath156^{2/3 } + ( 1-\\frac{a_{bf}}{a_{b } } ) v_{{\\rm ext}}(\\vec{r})+\\frac{a_{bf}}{a_{b}}\\mu = e_f\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is determined by @xmath158 .",
