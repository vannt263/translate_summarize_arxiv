    "recently , there is a strong interest in two - dimensional semiconductor systems with an inverted band structure , like narrow hgte quantum wells .",
    "this interest is mostly connected with the quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) effect regime  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the conventional quantum hall ( qh ) effect in high magnetic fields  @xcite , qsh regime is characterized  @xcite by presence of two spin - resolved , current - carrying helical edge states  @xcite even in zero magnetic field .",
    "the helical qsh edge states are regarded to be suitable for different applications like quantum computing and cryptography .",
    "experimental investigations of helical qsh edge states are mostly based on charge transport along the edge , which has been detected in local and non - local resistance measurements  @xcite and by a direct visualization technique  @xcite . in the last case",
    ", the edge current has even been demonstrated to coexist with the conductive bulk  @xcite , which is also possible from theoretical considerations  @xcite . despite the initial idea of a topological protection  @xcite",
    ", backscattering appears at macroscopic distances  @xcite , possibly due to the allowed two - particle process  @xcite or to the electron puddles  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that for possible applications , it is necessary to develop a technique of selective contacting of these edge states .",
    "a possible variant is to use spin effects : qsh edge transport is supposed to be essentially spin - dependent  @xcite even in zero magnetic field .",
    "strong coupling between the spin - resolved helical edge states and a ferromagnet can also be anticipated from theoretical considerations  @xcite .    here",
    ", we experimentally investigate spin - polarized electron transport between a permalloy ferromagnet and the edge of a two - dimensional electron system with band inversion , realized in a narrow , 8  nm wide hgte quantum well . in zero magnetic field , we observe strong asymmetry of the edge potential distribution with respect to the ferromagnetic ground lead .",
    "this result indicates that the helical edge channel , specific for the structures with band inversion even at the conductive bulk , is strongly coupled to the ferromagnetic side contact , possibly due to the effects of proximity magnetization .",
    "it allows selective and spin - sensitive contacting of helical edge states .",
    "stripes ( denoted as front , central , and back ) are placed at the 200  nm mesa step , with low ( 2 - 3  @xmath0 m ) overlap .",

    "both electrons and holes contribute to transport in this case .",
    "the carriers concentrations are low enough , about @xmath10@xmath6 and @xmath11@xmath6 for electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "electrons low - temperature mobility is about @xmath12@xmath8/vs , because the holes ( with lower @xmath13@xmath8/vs mobility ) provide efficient disorder screening  @xcite .",
    "our principal idea is to use side contact to the 2deg edge at the mesa step  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the usual procedure with annealed in contacts is not selective with respect to the edge state transport .",
    "annealed in provides high - quality ohmic contact primary to the bulk 2deg . thus , despite the edge current is allowed  @xcite to coexist with the conductive bulk  @xcite , edge state transport can only be investigated near the charge - neutrality point  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , without annealing procedure , the side contact is coupled to the 2deg edge at the mesa step , because the cdte layer on the top of the structure is a high - quality insulator at low temperatures .",

    "the measurements are performed at a temperature of 30  mk . to realize a spin - polarized transport , the permalloy stripes are initially pre - magnetized in the 2deg plane  @xcite .",
    "the sample is placed within a superconducting solenoid , so the initial in - plane magnetization can be changed by introducing relatively high ( above 1  t ) external magnetic field .",
    "the field is switched to zero afterward , so the measurements are performed in zero magnetic field .",
    "qualitatively similar results were obtained from different samples in several cooling cycles .",

    "examples of @xmath17 characteristics are presented in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] for transport across a single normal n-2deg ( a ) or ferromagnetic f-2deg ( b , c ) junction .    in a three - point technique ,",
    "the measured potential @xmath21 reflects in - series connected resistances of the grounded contact and the 2deg .",
    "this technique is especially convenient if the former term is dominant . in this case , the 2deg is equipotential , so the measured three - point @xmath17 curve is independent of the particular positions of the current / voltage probes .",
    "this is exactly that we have for the reference normal au-2deg junction , see fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( a ) .",

    "thus , the measured three - point @xmath17 curves in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( a ) reflect the behavior of the ( grounded ) au-2deg interface .",
    "these @xmath17 curves are obviously non - linear and are characterized by a high resistance ( about 10  m@xmath15 ) in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( a ) .",
    "the low - current resistive region with two kinks at about @xmath22  mv indicates a significant potential barrier ( depletion region  @xcite ) at the 2deg edge .",
    "similar high - resistive junctions we have obtained for other non - magnetic materials like sputtered nb and nbn  @xcite .    our most prominent experimental result is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) . if we ground the permalloy ferromagnetic side contact to the 8  nm hgte quantum well , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sample ] , the measured potential is strongly asymmetric . we obtain a significant signal @xmath1 , i.e. for the voltage probe placed between the current and ground ones , but @xmath2 is always zero .",
    "we observe the same behavior for both current polarities and for two different current probes in fig .",
    "[ sample ] , so the asymmetry between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is not connected with any absolute direction in the sample .",
    "this asymmetry is only determined by the mutual positions of the current and voltage contacts with respect to the grounded ferromagnetic lead .",
    "identical behavior is obtained for different ferromagnetic contacts and different 8  nm well samples .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the behavior , depicted in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) , is very unusual and is in a high contrast to the standard three - point resistance of a reference au contact in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( a ) .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath23 can not originate from bulk 2deg contribution to the measured potential : different signals @xmath24 would require the bulk 2deg resistance to exceed strongly the f-2deg interface contribution . because of high - resistive curves ( about 1  m@xmath15 corresponding resistance ) in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) , this is inconsistent with the metallic bulk conductivity ( below 1 k@xmath15 ) at @xmath5@xmath6 electron concentration in our samples .    to verify this conclusion experimentally ,",
    "similar measurements are performed for a 20  nm width hgte quantum well , see fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( c ) . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also different in this case , however , they are of the same order of magnitude : we do not observe @xmath16 in this case .",
    "both experimental @xmath17 curves correspond to about 1 k@xmath15 resistance , which is comparable with the bulk values .",
    "in other words , fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( c ) experimentally demonstrates the typical effect of bulk current contribution to a three - point signal in the case of low f-2deg interface resistance .",
    "the only difference between 8  nm and 20  nm hgte quantum wells is the conductive helical edge channel in the former case  @xcite . from the continuous evolution of the edge",
    "current when the system is driven away from the charge - neutral regime , demonstrated in ref .   by a direct visualization experiment",
    ", one can reasonably suppose that the edge current is still carried by helical spin - resolved edge states even at the conductive bulk 2deg .",
    "it requires low coupling between the edge states and the bulk , possibly because of the formation of a depletion region where the edge channel is laterally localized  @xcite .",
    "the depletion region of finite width is often present at the 2deg edge due to electrostatic effects  @xcite .",
    "this depletion region is also confirmed in our experiment by the zero @xmath16 for any distance to the potential probe in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) .",
    "since the conductive channel is present at the edge of a 8  nm hgte quantum well , the perfect ( @xmath16 for any current @xmath25 ) asymmetry of the edge potential @xmath26 , observed in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) , indicates that the grounded ferromagnetic side electrode is perfectly coupled to this channel .",
    "we verify the statement of ideal coupling of the ferromagnetic lead to the edge current by standard two - point characterization , see fig .",
    "it can be seen in the figure , that the two - point f-2deg - f @xmath17 curve , measured between two neighbor ferromagnetic contacts , coincides well with the three - point @xmath1 potential from fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) , so the interface contributions are negligible . in contrast , the experimental au-2deg - au @xmath17 curve in fig .  [ iv2p ] ( a ) corresponds to a roughly two times higher resistance than three - point potentials @xmath27 from fig .  [ ivnl ] ( a ) , so it mostly reflects the resistance of two resistive au-2deg interfaces",
    "we should conclude that only a ferromagnetic permalloy side contact is strongly coupled to the conductive helical edge channel in zero magnetic field : ( i ) the perfect ( @xmath16 for any current @xmath25 ) asymmetry of the edge potential @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) , is only observed for the 8  nm quantum well ; ( ii ) the coincidence between the two - point f-2deg - f @xmath17 curve with the three - point @xmath1 potential , see fig .",
    "[ iv2p ] ( b ) , directly indicates negligible f-2deg interface contributions .",
    "if the transport current is concentrated at the edge , it is flowing along the shortest edge to the ground lead and there should be no current flowing near the potential probe @xmath2 , so @xmath16 for any current @xmath25 .",
    "the potential @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) reflects therefore solely the resistance of the edge channel between two ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "it corresponds to about 1  m@xmath15 resistance , which is also well known for a transport along the helical current - carrying states at macroscopic distances  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention , that this 1  m@xmath15 resistance is still much smaller than the resistance for transport through the edge depletion region to the bulk ( cp . with fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( a ) ) , so the edge channel is still decoupled from the bulk even at macroscopic distances .",
    "this strong coupling is not defined by chemical composition of the metallic film or the fabrication technique : the sputtered permalloy film contacts the 20  nm hgte quantum well similarly to other non - magnetic materials .",
    "there should be a specific magnetic ( spin - dependent ) process , which couples the spin - polarized ferromagnetic side contact and the one - dimensional helical channel at the edge of a 2deg with band inversion : a proximity magnetization locally aligns  @xcite the spins of two helical edge states in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic contact .",
    "the spin - polarized electron flow from the ferromagnetic contact can be easily injected to the helical state with corresponding spin projection .",
    "the depletion at the interface decouples the bulk 2deg and makes the helical edge mode even more important .",
    "farther transport along the sample edge is diffusive at at macroscopic distances  @xcite , because of allowed backscattering  @xcite , so the injected electrons are flowing along the shortest edge to the ground lead .",
    "the coupling is independent of the magnetization direction , as we observe in the experiment , because it is the contact magnetization that defines the spin alignment direction , see fig .",
    "[ discussion ] .     at low currents .",
    "the zero - bias resistance peak is strongly affected by ( a ) temperature and ( b ) gate voltage .",
    "it disappears completely above 0.5  k , which is consistent with the non - linearity onset @xmath28  mv in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) .",
    "the measurements are performed in zero magnetic field for the 8  nm wide hgte well sample b with a metallic gate . ]",
    "the proximity magnetization can be directly identified in the experimental data .",
    "it opens a gap in the one - dimensional spectrum in the vicinity of the contact  @xcite , which can be seen as a @xmath28  mv width region of high resistance in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) .",
    "this gap only affects the edge channel resistance , and has no effect on its coupling to the ferromagnetic electrode .",
    "the zero - bias resistive region is demonstrated in detail in fig .",
    "[ ivgate ] as @xmath29 dependencies for the sample b with a metallic gate .",
    "it disappears completely above 0.5  k , which is consistent in value with the non - linearity onset @xmath28  mv in fig .",
    "[ ivnl ] ( b ) .",
    "in contrast , the linear branches of the @xmath30 curve are invariant below 1  k , which is also consistent with the reported temperature behavior of the diffusive helical edge state transport at macroscopic distances  @xcite .",
    "the zero - bias resistive region is strongly sensitive to the gate voltage , even if it low enough to have no effect on the bulk carrier concentration , see fig .",
    "[ ivgate ] ( b ) .",
    "the suppression is fully symmetric with respect to a gate voltage sign .",
    "we connect it with the edge state structure reconstruction  @xcite in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic contact ( denoted by a blue region in fig .  [ discussion ] ) , which , however , needs further investigations .",
    "a magnetic field above 0.2  t sharply increases the zero - bias resistive region .",
    "this behavior is consistent with a spectrum gap  @xcite due to proximity magnetization , the gap value can be estimated as @xmath28  mev .",
    "as a result , we experimentally investigate spin - polarized electron transport between a permalloy ferromagnet and the edge of a two - dimensional electron system with band inversion , realized in a narrow , 8  nm wide hgte quantum well . in zero magnetic field , we observe strong asymmetry of the edge potential distribution with respect to the ferromagnetic ground lead .",
    "this result indicates that the helical edge channel , specific for the structures with band inversion even at the conductive bulk , is strongly coupled to the ferromagnetic side contact , possibly due to the effects of proximity magnetization .",
