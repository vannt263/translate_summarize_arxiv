    "despite the great deal of attention lavished recently on magnetic quantum critical phenomena , relatively little work has been done on systems in which one of the phases has an extensive , spatially averaged , magnetic moment .",
    "in fact , the simple stoner mean - field theory  @xcite of the zero temperature transition from an unpolarized fermi liquid to a ferromagnetic phase is an example of such a study , and is probably also the earliest theory of a quantum phase transition in any system .",
    "what makes such phases , and the transitions between them , interesting is that the order parameter is also a conserved charge ; in systems with a heisenberg @xmath2 symmetry this is expected to lead to strong constraints on the critical field theories  @xcite . as we will discuss briefly below",
    ", a number of recent experiments have studied systems in which the quantum fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter appear to play a central role .",
    "this emphasizes the need for a more complete theoretical understanding of quantum transitions into such phases . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce what we believe are the simplest theoretical models which display phases and phase transitions with these properties .",
    "the degrees of freedom of these models are purely bosonic and consist of quantum rotors on the sites of a lattice",
    ". we will also present a fairly complete theory of the universal properties of the phases and phase transitions in these models , at least in spatial dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "our quantum rotor models completely neglect charged and fermionic excitations and can therefore probably be applied directly only to insulating ferromagnets . however , in @xmath0 , we will argue that the critical behaviors of transitions in metallic , fermionic systems are identical to those of the corresponding transitions in certain quantum rotor models .",
    "we now describe the theoretical and experimental motivation behind our work : + ( _ i _ ) the stoner mean field theory of ferromagnetism  @xcite in electronic systems in fact contains two transitions : one from an unpolarized fermi liquid to a partially polarized itinerant ferromagnet ( which has received some recent experimental attention  @xcite ) , and the second from the partially polarized to the saturated ferromagnet .",
    "a theory of fluctuations near the first critical point has been proposed  @xcite but many basic questions remain unanswered  @xcite , especially on the ordered side  @xcite ( there is no proposed theory for the second transition , although we will outline one in this paper ) .",
    "it seems useful to examine some these issues in the simpler context of insulating ferromagnets .",
    "indeed , as we have noted , we shall argue below that in @xmath0 , certain insulating and itinerant systems have phase transitions that are in the same universality class .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) many of the phases we expect to find in our model also exist in experimental compounds that realize the so - called `` singlet - triplet '' model  @xcite .",
    "these compounds were studied many years ago  @xcite with a primary focus on finite temperature , classical phase transitions ; we hope that our study will stimulate a re - examination of these systems to search for quantum phase transitions + ( _ iii _ ) all of the phases expected in our model ( phases a - d in section  [ sec : phases ] below ) , occur in the @xmath4 compounds  @xcite .",
    "these , and related compounds , have seen a great deal of recent interest for their technologically important `` colossal magnetoresistance '' .",
    "+ ( _ iv _ ) recent nmr experiments by barrett _ et .",
    "@xcite have studied the magnetization of a quantum hall system as a function of both filling factor , @xmath5 , and temperature , @xmath6 , near @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 state at @xmath9 is a fully polarized ferromagnet  @xcite and its finite temperature properties have been studied from a field - theoretic point of view  @xcite .",
    "more interesting for our purposes here is the physics away from @xmath10 : brey _ et .",
    "al . _ have proposed a variational ground state consisting of a crystal of `` skyrmions '' ; this state has magnetic order that is _ canted _",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ in addition to a ferromagnet moment , the system has magnetic order ( with a vanishing spatially averaged moment ) in the plane perpendicular to the average moment .",
    "a phase with just this structure will appear in our analysis , along with a quantum - critical point between a ferromagnetic and a canted phase .",
    "although our microscopic models are quite different from those appropriate for the quantum hall system , we expect the insights and possibly some universal features of our results to be applicable to the latter .",
    "there has also been some interesting recent work on the effects of randomness on itinerant ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "this paper shall focus exclusively on clean ferromagnets , and the study of the effects of randomness on the models of this paper remains an interesting open problem ; we shall make a few remarks on this in section  [ randomness ]    in the following subsection we will introduce one of the models studied in this paper , followed by a brief description of its phases in section  [ sec : phases ] .",
    "section  [ intro ] will conclude with an outline of the remainder of the paper .",
    "we introduce the quantum rotor model which shall be the main focus of the paper ; extensions to related models will be considered later in the body of the paper . on each site @xmath11 of a regular lattice in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "there is a rotor whose configuration space is the surface of a sphere , described by the 3-component unit vector @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) ; the caret denotes that it is a quantum operator .",
    "the canonically conjugate angular momenta are the @xmath15 , and these degrees of freedom obey the commutation relations ( dropping the site index as all operators at different sites commute ) @xmath16 = 0~~;~~ [ \\hat{l}_{\\mu } , \\hat{l}_{\\nu } ] = i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda } \\hat{l}_{\\lambda}~~;~~ [ \\hat{l}_{\\mu } , \\hat{n}_{\\nu } ] = i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda } \\hat{n}_{\\lambda } \\label{commute}\\ ] ] as an operator on wavefunctions in the @xmath17 configuration space , @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 we will be interested primarily in the properties of the hamiltonian @xmath20 where there is an implied summation over repeated @xmath21 indices , and @xmath22 is the sum over nearest neighbors , and the couplings @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are all positive .",
    "all previous analyses of quantum rotor models  @xcite have focussed exclusively on the case @xmath28 , and the novelty of our results arises primarily from nonzero values of the new @xmath29 couplings .",
    "a crucial property of @xmath30 is that the 3 charges @xmath31 commute with it , and are therefore conserved .",
    "indeed , @xmath30 is the most general hamiltonian with bilinear , nearest neighbor couplings between the @xmath32 and @xmath33 operators , consistent with conservation of the @xmath34 .",
    "we have also included a single quartic term , with coefficient @xmath35 , but its role is merely to suppress the contributions of unimportant high energy states .",
    "discrete symmetries of @xmath36 will also be important in our considerations .",
    "time - reversal symmetry , @xmath37 is realized by the transformations @xmath38 notice that the commutators ( [ commute ] ) change sign under @xmath39 , consistent with it being an anti - unitary transformation .",
    "all the models considered in this paper will have @xmath37 as a symmetry . for the special case @xmath40",
    ", we also have the additional inversion symmetry @xmath41 : @xmath42 the presence of @xmath41 will make the properties of the @xmath40 system somewhat different from the @xmath43 case .",
    "we will see later that @xmath41 is related to a discrete spatial symmetry of the underlying spin system that @xmath30 models .",
    "the utility of @xmath30 does not lie in the possibility of finding an experimental system which may be explicitly modeled by it .",
    "rather , we will find that it provides a particularly simple and appealing description of quantum phases and phase transitions with a conserved order parameter in a system with a non - abelian symmetry .",
    "further , we will focus primarily on universal properties of @xmath30 , which are dependent only on global symmetries of the states ; these properties are expected to be quite general and should apply also to other models with the same symmetries , including those containing ordinary heisenberg spins .    to help the reader",
    "develop some intuition on the possibly unfamiliar degrees of freedom in @xmath30 , we consider in appendix  [ twolayer ] a general double - layer heisenberg spin model  @xcite containing both inter- and intra - layer exchange interactions .",
    "we show that , under suitable conditions , there is a fairly explicit mapping of the double layer model to the quantum rotor hamiltonian @xmath30 . under this mapping",
    "we find that each _ pair _ of adjacent spins on the two layers behaves like a single quantum rotor .",
    "in particular @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the two layers and the @xmath47 are heisenberg spins .",
    "notice also that @xmath41 is a layer - interchange symmetry .    before turning to a description of the ground state of @xmath30 , it is useful to draw a parallel to another model which has seen a great deal of recent interest  the boson hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the latter model has a single conserved charge , @xmath48 the total boson number , associated with an abelian global @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the quantum rotor model @xmath30 has the 3 charges @xmath34 , and a non - abelian global @xmath2 symmetry . as we will see , the non - abelian symmetry plays a key role and is primarily responsible for the significant differences between @xmath30 and the boson hubbard model .",
    "it is also useful to discuss a term - by - term mapping between @xmath30 and the boson hubbard model .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath23 in @xmath30 are analogous to the on - site hubbard repulsion in the boson model .",
    "the latter model also has an on - site chemical potential term which couples linearly to @xmath50 , but such a term is prohibited by symmetry in the non - abelian rotor model .",
    "the @xmath25 term in @xmath30 has an effect similar to the boson hopping term , while the @xmath26 term is like a nearest - neighbor boson density - density interaction .",
    "there is no analog of the @xmath27 term in the boson hubbard model .",
    "we show in fig  [ phasediag1 ] the zero temperature ( @xmath6 ) phase diagram of @xmath30 in the @xmath51 plane at fixed @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath27 .",
    "this phase diagram was obtained using a mean - field theory which becomes in exact in the limit of large spatial dimensionality ( @xmath1 ) ; however , the topology and general features are expected to be valid for all @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 case will be discussed separately later in the paper ; in the following discussion we will assume @xmath52 .",
    "we will also assume below that @xmath53 symmetry is absent , unless otherwise noted . throughout this paper we will restrict consideration to parameters for which the ground state of @xmath30 are translationally invariant ground states",
    " this will require that @xmath27 not be too large .",
    "there are four distinct classes of phases :    ( a )    this is a featureless spin singlet and there is a gap to all excitations .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry remains unbroken , as @xmath54 clearly this phase will always occur when @xmath23 is much bigger than all the other couplings .",
    "( b )    these are ordinary ferromagnets in which the total moment of the ground state is quantized in integer multiples of the number of quantum rotors ( extensions of @xmath30 in which the quantization is in half - integral multiples will be considered later in this paper ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic order parameter chooses a direction in spin space ( say , @xmath55 ) , but the symmetry of rotations about this direction remains unbroken .",
    "the ground state therefore has the expectation values @xmath56 the value of @xmath57 is not quantized and varies continuously as @xmath26 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 are varied ; for the system with @xmath41 symmetry ( @xmath40 ) we will have @xmath58 in this phase . if we consider each quantum rotor as an effective degree of freedom representing a set of underlying heisenberg spins ( as in the double - layer model of appendix  [ twolayer ] ) , then @xmath57 determines the manner in which the quantized moment is distributed among the constituent spins .",
    "the low - lying excitation of these phases is a gapless , spin - wave mode whose frequency @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wavevector of the excitation .    that these phases occur is seen as follows : first consider the line @xmath61 .",
    "for very small @xmath26 , it is clear that the ground state is a quantum paramagnet.as @xmath26 is increased , it is easy to convince oneself ( by an explicit calculation ) that a series of quantized ferromagnet phases with increasing values of @xmath62 integer get stabilized .",
    "further in this simple limit the exact ground state in each one of these phases is just a state in which each site is put in the same eigenstate of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "there is a finite energy cost to change the value of @xmath63 at any site .",
    "now consider moving away from this limit by introducing small non - zero values of @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "these terms vanish in the subspace of states with a constant value of @xmath65 so we need to consider excitations to states which involve changing the value of @xmath65 at some site . as mentioned above such states",
    "are separated from the ground state by a gap . consequently , though the new ground state is no longer the same as at @xmath61 , it s quantum numbers , in particular the value of @xmath66 , are unchanged.the stability of the quantized ferromagnet phases up to finite values of @xmath25 and @xmath27 implies the existence of direct transitions between them which is naturally first order . in general a non - zero value of @xmath27",
    "will also lead to a non - zero value of @xmath67 .",
    "all of this should remind the reader of the mott - insulating phases of the boson hubbard model  @xcite . in the latter , the boson number , @xmath68 , is quantized in integers , which is the analog of the conserved angular momentum @xmath33 of the present model .",
    "however , the properties of the mott phases are quite similar for all values of @xmath69 , including @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath2 rotor model , the case @xmath71 ( the quantum paramagnet , which has no broken symmetry and a gap to all excitations ) is quite different from @xmath72 cases ( the quantized ferromagnets , which have a broken symmetry and associated gapless spin - wave excitations ) . as we argued above and",
    "as shown in fig  [ phasediag1 ] , the lobes of the quantized ferromagnets and the quantum paramagnet are separated by first - order transitions , while there were no such transitions in the phase diagram for the boson hubbard model in ref  @xcite ; this is an artifact of the absence of off - site boson attraction terms analogous to the @xmath26 term in ref  @xcite , and is _ not _ an intrinsic difference between the abelian and non - abelian cases .",
    "( c )    in this phase we have @xmath73 this occurs when @xmath25 is much bigger than all other couplings .",
    "we refer to it as the nel phase because the spins in the bilayer model are oriented in opposite directions in the two layers .",
    "more generally , this represents any phase in which the spin - ordering is defined by a single vector field ( @xmath17 ) and which has no net ferromagnetic moment .",
    "there are 2 low - lying spin - wave modes , but they now have a linear dispersion @xmath74  @xcite",
    ". the order parameter condensate @xmath75 does not have a quantized value and varies continuously with changes in the couplings .    from the perspective of classical statistical mechanics ,",
    "the existence of this nel phase is rather surprising .",
    "note that there is a linear coupling @xmath76 in @xmath30 between the @xmath32 and @xmath33 fields . in a classical system",
    ", such a coupling would imply that a non - zero condensate of @xmath33 must necessarily accompany any condensate in @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of a phase here , in which @xmath77 despite @xmath78 , is a consequence of the quantum mechanics of the conserved field @xmath33 .",
    "( d )    now both fields have a condensate : @xmath79 the magnitudes of , and relative angle between , the condensates can all take arbitrarily values , which vary continuously as the couplings change ; however if @xmath41 is a symmetry ( if @xmath40 ) then @xmath80 is always orthogonal to @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry of @xmath30 is completely broken as it takes two vectors to specify the orientation of the condensate . in the bilayer model , the spins in the two layers are oriented in two non - collinear directions , such that there is a net ferromagnetic moment .",
    "the low lying excitations of this phase consist of 2 spin wave modes , one with @xmath74 , while the other has @xmath59 .",
    "this phase is the analog of the superfluid phase in the boson hubbard model . in the latter model",
    "the conserved number density has an arbitrary , continuously varying value and there is long range order in the conjugate phase variable ; similarly here the conserved @xmath81 has an arbitrary value and the conjugate @xmath32 field has a definite orientation .    at this point",
    ", it is useful to observe a parallel between the phases of the quantum rotor model and those of a ferromagnet fermi liquid .",
    "this parallel is rather crude for @xmath52 , but , as we will see in secs  [ deq1 ] and  [ conc ] , it can be made fairly explicit in @xmath0 where we believe that the universality classes of the transitions in the rotor model and the fermi liquid are identical .",
    "the quantized ferromagnetic phases b are the analogs of the fully polarized phase of the fermi liquid in which the spins of all electrons are parallel .",
    "the canted phase d has a continuously varying ground state polarization , as in a partially polarized fermi liquid .",
    "finally the nel phase c is similar to an unpolarized fermi liquid in that both have no net magnetization and exhibit gapless spin excitations .",
    "finally , we point out an interesting relationship between phases with a non - quantized value of the average magnetization ( as in phase d of the rotor model ) , and phases with vanishing average magnetization ( phases a and c ) . notice that , in both the fermi liquid and the quantum rotor model , it is possible to have a continuous transition between such phases .",
    "however , in both cases , such a transition only occurs when the phase with vanishing magnetization has gapless spin excitations ; in phase c of the rotor model we have the gapless spin waves associated with the nel long range order , while in the unpolarized fermi liquid we have gapless spin carrying fermionic quasiparticles . phase a of the rotor model has no gapless excitations , but notice that there is no continuous transition between it and the partially polarized canted phase d. we believe this feature to be a general principle : _ continuous zero temperature transitions in which there is an onset in the mean value of a non - abelian conserved charge only occur from phases which have gapless excitations . _    the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "we will begin in section  [ mft ] by discussing the mean field theory which produced the phases described above . in section  [ struct ]",
    "we will perform a small fluctuation analysis of the low - lying excitations of the phases .",
    "we will turn our attention to the quantum phase transitions in @xmath52 in section  [ qpt ] , focusing mainly on the transition between phases c and d in section  [ ctod ] , and that between phases b and d in section  [ btod ] . in section  [ monopole ]",
    "we shall consider an extension of the basic rotor model ( [ hrotor ] ) : each rotor will have a ` magnetic monopole ' at the origin of @xmath82 space , which causes the angular momentum of each rotor to always be non - zero .",
    "we will turn our attention to the important and distinct physics in @xmath0 in section  [ deq1 ] .",
    "we will conclude in section  [ conc ] by placing our results in the context of earlier work and discuss future directions for research .",
    "some ancillary results are in 5 appendices : we note especially appendix  [ appcalc ] , which contains new universal scaling functions of the dilute bose gas , a model which turns out to play a central role in our analysis .",
    "in this section we will describe the mean - field theory in which the phase diagram of fig  [ phasediag1 ] was obtained .",
    "the mean - field results become exact in the limit of large spatial dimensionality , @xmath1 . rather than explicitly discussing the structure of the large @xmath1 limit ,",
    "we choose instead a more physical discussion .",
    "we postulate on every site a single - site mean field hamiltonian @xmath83 which is a function of the variational c - number local fields @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these fields are determined at @xmath8 by minimizing the expectation value of @xmath30 in the ground state wavefunction of @xmath86 .",
    "the mean - field ground state energy of @xmath30 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the ground state energy of the @xmath89 , all expectation values are in the ground state wavefunction of @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the co - ordination number of the lattice .",
    "we now have to minimize the value of @xmath91 over variations in @xmath85 and @xmath84 .",
    "this was carried out numerically for a characteristic set of values of the coupling constants .",
    "stability required that the coupling @xmath27 not be too large .",
    "further details may be found in appendix  [ mfta ] .",
    "here we describe the behavior of the local effective fields @xmath85 , @xmath84 in the various phases : + ( a ) _ quantum paramagnet : _",

    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath98 remains pinned at a fixed non - zero integer .",
    "this is clearly possible only because @xmath33 commutes with @xmath30 and @xmath89 , and @xmath64 is therefore a good quantum number .",

    ", there is no net ferromagnetic moment in this phase .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath89 of section  [ mft ] was diagonalized by determining its matrix elements in the basis of spherical harmonic states : @xmath513 with @xmath514 integers satisfying @xmath515 and @xmath516 .",

    "all matrix elements not obtainable by complex conjugation of the above are zero .",
    "notice that @xmath347 only has non - zero matrix elements between states with angular momenta @xmath108 and @xmath520 .",
    "in particular , matrix elements of @xmath347 between states with the same value of @xmath108 vanish ; this happens because @xmath347 is odd under @xmath41 , and the @xmath521 states have definite @xmath41-parity .",

    "it is convenient to write an effective action functional in terms of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 fields : the form of this functional can be guessed by symmetry and the usual landau arguments : @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 we have temporarily modified @xmath17 from a fixed - length to a `` soft- spin '' field ; this is merely for convenience in the following discussion and not essential . here",
    "@xmath118 is an external magnetic field whose coupling to the fields is determined by gauge - invariance  @xcite .",
    "the reason for splitting the lagrangian into pieces @xmath119 , @xmath120 will become clear below .    we can now look for static , spatially uniform , saddle points of @xmath121 . this gives three different types of solutions , corresponding to the phases a , c , and d ( the absence of a length constraint on @xmath17 is necessary to obtain all three saddle - points at tree level ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath85 and @xmath17 fields at these saddle points are identical in form to those discussed for these phases in section  [ mft ] ( with the reminder that we have temporarily specialized to @xmath112 so that @xmath41 is a good symmetry ) .",
    "note that there is no saddle point corresponding to the b phases : this is clearly a consequence of ignoring the non - analytic behavior of @xmath109 in @xmath105 .",
    "the low - lying excitation spectrum in the a , c , and d phases can now be determined by an analysis of gaussian fluctuations about the saddle points . while simple in principle , such an analysis is quite tedious and involved , especially in phase d. we will therefore not present it here ; we present instead a more elegant approach in which the answer can be obtained with minimal effort .",
    "recall that an efficient method of obtaining the properties of the nel phase is to use a non - linear sigma model in which the constraint @xmath122 is imposed .",
    "this eliminates high energy states from the hilbert space associated with amplitude fluctuations , but does not modify the low energy spectrum .",
    "we introduce here an extension to a hybrid sigma model which allows also for the existence of the canted phase d. notice from the mean- field solutions in sec  [ mft ] that the onset of the canted phase d is signaled by the appearance of an expectation value of @xmath85 in a direction orthogonal to the mean direction of @xmath17 , while the component of @xmath85 parallel to @xmath17 is zero in both the c ( nel ) and d phases ( note : the last restriction on components of @xmath85 and @xmath17 parallel to each other requires @xmath41 symmetry and @xmath112 ) .",
    "this suggests that the important fluctuations are the components of @xmath85 perpendicular to @xmath17 , while fluctuations which change the dot product @xmath123 are high energy modes .",
    "so we define our hybrid sigma model by imposing the two rotationally invariant constraints @xmath124 with these constraints , the degrees of freedom have been reduced from the original 6 real fields @xmath85 , @xmath17 to 4 .",

    "simple power - counting arguments do not permit any further simplifications to be made to this action . despite the apparent formidable complexity of its form , the rg properties of ( [ actionbtod ] ) are quite simple , as we shall now describe .",
    "we will consider the cases with and without @xmath41 symmetry separately .",
    "now we have @xmath325 .",
    "the non - analytic terms in the propagator of ( [ actionbtod ] ) disappear , and the remaining terms are identical to those in the action of a dilute bose gas with a repulsive interaction @xmath138 .",
    "the order parameter , @xmath127 , and the spectator modes , @xmath129 , are essentially independent , with all couplings between them contributing only `` irrelevant '' corrections to the leading critical behavior .",
    "the critical theory of the quantum transition in the dilute bose gas has been studied earlier  @xcite ( see appendix  [ appcalc ] ) , and also appeared as the fixed point theory in section  [ secrgmneq0 ] . a measure of the strength of the loop corrections is the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath350 ( the analog here of eqn ( [ defg0 ] ) ) @xmath351 ( where , as before , @xmath21 is a renormalization momentum scale , @xmath352 is a phase space factor , and the symbol @xmath23 is not to be confused with the coupling @xmath23 in ( [ hrotor ] ) ) , which determines the scattering amplitude of two pre - existing excitations .",
    "this amplitude undergoes a one - loop renormalization due to diagrams associated with repeated scattering of the two excitations , a process which leads to the @xmath237 function @xmath353 where @xmath229 and we have used the minimal subtraction method to define the renormalized @xmath23 ( this @xmath237 function is in fact exact to all orders in @xmath23see appendix  [ appcalc ] ) .",
    "the infrared stable fixed point is @xmath354 for @xmath225 , and @xmath355 for @xmath228 .",
    "the exponents take the same values as in section  [ secrgmneq0 ] @xmath356 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the present subsection and section  [ secrgmneq0 ] have very different interpretations of the order parameter . in section  [ secrgmneq0 ] the exponent @xmath181",
    "is associated with the field @xmath129 which is proportional to the ferromagnetic moment . here",
    "the @xmath181 refers to the the field @xmath127 , and the ferromagnetic order parameter scales as @xmath357 as we discuss below .",
    "the magnetization density order parameter @xmath358 , is defined by generalizing ( [ defcalm ] ) a space - time dependent external magnetic field @xmath359 . in the quantized ferromagnetic phase b , clearly @xmath360 .",
    "therefore , the _ deviation _",
    "@xmath361 can serve as another order parameter for the b to d transition .",
    "indeed , this order parameter scales as @xmath362 , and we can define an associated `` anomalous '' dimension @xmath363 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath364 , and so the identity  @xcite @xmath365 is always satisfied . as in ref  @xcite",
    ", we can also compute the behavior of the mean value of this conserved order parameter in the canted phase d. for @xmath228 , this behavior is universal and is given by @xmath366 where @xmath367 is a universal number ; we compute @xmath367 in an expansion in @xmath368 in appendix  [ appcalc ] . note that the magnetization density can increase or decrease into the ferromagnetic phase , depending upon the sign of @xmath323 ; this behavior is consistent with that of the mean field theory in section  [ mft ] .",
    "note also that ( [ calmval ] ) is independent of the magnitude of @xmath323 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath323 however does determine the width of the critical region within which ( [ calmval ] ) is valid .",
    "for @xmath369 smaller than @xmath370 , it becomes necessary to include the leading irrelevant frequency dependence in the propagator of ( [ actionbtod ] ) - a @xmath371 term .",
    "the point @xmath372 is a special multicritical point at which this new term is important at all values of @xmath373 ; this multicritical point has @xmath374  @xcite , and has @xmath375 continue to equal @xmath334 ( to leading order ) in phase d.      the theory without @xmath41 symmetry is somewhat more involved , and it is convenient to work with a more compact notation .",
    "we rescale @xmath376 , @xmath377 , and manipulate ( [ actionbtod ] ) into the form @xmath378 where @xmath379 , @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 .",

    "a key property of this perturbation theory , similar to that noted in section  [ secrgmeq0 ] , is that no terms sensitive to the ratio @xmath387 , as @xmath388 , @xmath389 , are ever generated . as a result the term multiplying @xmath383 in ( [ actionbtodn ] )",
    "does not undergo any direct renormalization . with this in mind",
    ", we define the renormalized field by @xmath390 , and the renormalized couplings by @xmath391 , @xmath392 , @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "it remains to compute the renormalization constants @xmath90 , @xmath395 , @xmath396 , and @xmath233 .",
    "in the perturbation theory in @xmath23 , the sign of @xmath252 ( which is also the sign of @xmath324 ) plays a crucial role .",
    "the physical interpretation of this sign is the following : when @xmath397 , the spin wave quanta , @xmath129 , and the order parameter quanta , @xmath127 , carry the same magnetic moment ; however for @xmath398 they carry opposite magnetic moments .",
    "this was already clear in the @xmath399 result ( [ calmval ] ) , where the condensation of @xmath127 lead to a decrease or increase in the mean magnetization density depending upon the sign of @xmath323 . for @xmath400 , it is then possible to have a low - lying excitation of a @xmath127 and a @xmath129 quantum , which has the same spin as the ground state .",
    "for the system without @xmath41 symmetry , such an excitation will mix with the ground state , and leads to some interesting structure in the renormalization group . in the actual computation ,",
    "the sign of @xmath252 determines the location of the poles of the propagator of ( [ actionbtodn ] ) in the complex frequency plane .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the propagator has two poles , and both poles are in the same half - plane for @xmath397 , while for @xmath398 the poles lie on opposite sides of the real frequency axis .",
    "we will consider these two cases separately below :     + for the case where the poles are in the same half - plane , we can close the contour of frequency integrals in the other half - plane , and as a result many feynman diagrams are exactly zero . in particular , all graphs in the expansion of the self energy vanish . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath401 there is still a non - trivial contribution to @xmath233 ( from the ` particle - particle ' graph ) : @xmath402 where , as before @xmath229 .",
    "these renormalization constants lead to the @xmath237 functions @xmath403 the vanishing of @xmath404 and @xmath405 is expected to hold to all orders in @xmath23 ; as a result , @xmath406 and @xmath252 are dimensionless constants which can modify the scaling properties .",
    "the exponents are however independent of the values of @xmath406 and @xmath252 , and are identical to those of the system with @xmath41 symmetry , discussed above in section  [ secrgbtod]a .",
    "the upper critical dimension is @xmath407 , and for @xmath228 the magnetization density obeys an equation similar to ( [ calmval ] ) @xmath408 the ` universal ' number @xmath409 now does depend upon @xmath406 and @xmath252 : the leading term in @xmath409 can be computed by using the gauge - invariance argument to deduce the modification of ( [ actionbtodn ] ) in a field , using ( [ defcalm ] ) to determine the expression for @xmath410  @xcite , determining the fixed point of @xmath411 , and then using the method of ref  @xcite  this gives @xmath412 this result should be compared with the first term in ( [ rescalcd ] ) , which is the value of @xmath367 for the bose gas .",

    "the prefactors of the these corrections , and also some amplitude ratios , will vary continuously with the value of @xmath428 along the fixed line .",
    "we now consider an extension of the rotor model @xmath30 in which each rotor has a ` magnetic monopole ' at the origin of @xmath82 space .",
    "our motivations for doing this are : ( _ i _ ) it allows for quantized ferromagnetic states in which the moment is a half - integer times the number of rotor sites .",
    "such phases will occur in cases in which each rotor corresponds to an odd number of heisenberg spins in an underlying spin model .",
    "( _ ii _ ) in @xmath0 ( to be discussed in sec  [ deq1 ] ) such rotor models will lead , by the construction of ref  @xcite , to nel phases described by a sigma model with a topological theta term .    following the method of wu and yang  @xcite , we generalize the form ( [ lrep ] ) of @xmath18 to @xmath441 where @xmath442 is chosen to have one of the values @xmath443 and @xmath444 is the vector potential of a dirac monopole at the origin of @xmath82 space which satisfies @xmath445 ( we considered this same function in sec  [ btod ] for different reasons ) .",
    "we will work exclusively on bipartite lattices and choose @xmath446 ( @xmath447 ) on the first ( second ) sublattice : we will comment below on the reason for this choice .",
    "it can now be verified that ( [ lrep2 ] ) continues to satisfy the commutation relations ( [ commute ] ) for all @xmath442 .",
    "however the hilbert space on each site is restricted to states @xmath448 satisfying @xmath449  @xcite . notice that there is a minimum value , @xmath442 , to the allowed angular momentum .",
    "another consequence of a non - zero @xmath442 is that it is no longer possible to have @xmath41 as a symmetry of a rotor hamiltonian .",
    "there is a part of @xmath18 in ( [ lrep2 ] ) which is proportional to @xmath114 , and this constrains @xmath18 , @xmath347 to have the same signature under discrete transformations : this rules out @xmath41 as a symmetry , even in models with @xmath40 .",
    "our insertion of the @xmath450 in ( [ lrep2 ] ) is also related to the absence of the @xmath41 symmetry for @xmath451 . because @xmath452 and @xmath32 have the same signature under all allowed symmetries for @xmath451 , their expectation values turn out to be proportional to each other on a given site , with the sign of the proportionality constant determined by @xmath450 ( we will see this explicitly below ) . in a @xmath451 model with @xmath446 on every site ,",
    "the spatial average of @xmath453 is proportional to that of @xmath454 and therefore to the net ferromagnetic moment ; as a result , such models turn out to have only quantized ferromagnetic phases .",
    "staggering of @xmath450 is a way of inducing a nel - like order parameter with no net moment ; then a spatially uniform value of @xmath455 represents a staggered mean value of the angular momentum @xmath456 , as expected from a nel order parameter .",
    "the staggering of @xmath450 was also present in the @xmath0 analysis of ref  @xcite , and was crucial there in generating the topological theta term .",
    "we present in fig  [ phasediag2 ] the mean field phase diagram of the hamiltonian @xmath30 ( eqn ( [ hrotor ] ) ) on a bipartite lattice with @xmath40 , @xmath18 given by ( [ lrep2 ] ) , and @xmath457 . because of absence of the @xmath41 symmetry ,",
    "a non - zero @xmath27 will not make a qualitative difference .",
    "other values of the @xmath442 are also expected to have a similar phase diagram .",
    "the caption describes the non - zero components of @xmath456 and @xmath453 in the various phases .",
    "the expectation values @xmath458 have exactly the same form as the @xmath459 in spin space , but the opposite signature in sublattice space ( _ e.g. _ a staggered configuration of @xmath460 implies a uniform configuration of @xmath461 and vice versa ) .",
    "the phases in fig  [ phasediag2 ] are closely related to those in fig  [ phasediag1 ] . as before we have the quantized ferromagnetic phases b ( albeit , now with half - integral moments ) , the nel phase c , and the canted phase d. the main difference is in the absence of a quantum paramagnetic phase a : this is clearly due to the minimum allowed value @xmath457 in the single rotor angular momentum .",
    "it is now possible to undertake an analysis of the low energy properties of the phases , and of the critical properties of the phase transitions , much like that carried out in secs  [ struct ] and  [ qpt ] for the @xmath462 case : such an analysis shows essentially no differences between @xmath462 and @xmath463 , at least for @xmath52 .",
    "the excitations of the phases b , c , and d in fig  [ phasediag2 ] are the same as those of the corresponding phases in fig  [ phasediag1 ] , as are the universality classes of the continuous phase transitions between c and d , and between b and d. one small , but important , point has to be kept in mind in this regard .",
    "the @xmath451 models are not invariant under the symmetry",
    "@xmath41 even when @xmath40 , and so the restrictions that the @xmath41 symmetry implies for the @xmath462 analysis of secs  [ struct ] and  [ qpt ] must not be imposed now .    in @xmath0 , there are significant differences between the @xmath462 and @xmath457 cases , and these will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the general topology of the mean - field phase diagrams figs  [ phasediag1 ] and  [ phasediag2 ] is expected to hold for all @xmath52 .",
    "as we have seen in sec  [ qpt ] , for @xmath228 fluctuations do modify the critical properties of the continuous transitions , but these modifications are computable in a systematic expansion in @xmath464 . in @xmath0 , fluctuations modify not only the transitions , but also the stability of the phases : as a result , we expect significant changes in the topology of the phase diagram itself .",
    "further , we also expect a sensitive dependence to the value of the monopole charge @xmath442 . in the following , we present a mixture of results , educated surmises and speculation on the nature of the phases and phase transitions in @xmath0 for different values of @xmath442 .",
    "the expected phase diagram is shown in fig  [ q0 ] .",
    "we discuss some of the important features in turn : + ( _ i _ ) there is no phase with nel order ( the analog of phase c for @xmath52 ) ; it has been pre - empted mostly by the quantum paramagnet a. fluctuations in the incipient nel phase would be described by a @xmath2 non - linear sigma model in @xmath465 dimensions ( without a topological term ) , which is known not to have a phase with long - range order .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) the quantized ferromagnetic phases , b , are stable even in @xmath0 .",
    "they have the usual @xmath59 spectrum of spin - wave excitations .",
    "+ ( _ iii _ ) the canted phase d has been replaced by a novel new phase e - the partially polarized ferromagnet .",
    "the phase e has true long - range order in the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath466 ; however the value of @xmath466 is not quantized and varies continuously .",
    "the canted phase d , in @xmath52 , also had long - range order in @xmath467 in the @xmath468 plane ; in contrast , in phase e ( @xmath0 ) this long- range order has been replaced by a quasi - long - range xy order _",
    "i.e. _ correlations of @xmath467 decay algebraically in the @xmath468 plane .",
    "the only true broken symmetry is that associated with @xmath466 , and the system is invariant with respect to rotations about the @xmath55 axis ( compare with phase d in which the @xmath2 symmetry was completely broken and there was no invariant axis ) .",
    "note that though there is no lro in the @xmath468 plane in phase e , the goldstone mode of phase d , associated with it s @xmath468 lro survives i.e. phase e has not only a gapless mode @xmath59 due to ferromagnetic long - range order , but also a gapless mode @xmath74 due to quasi lro in the @xmath467 field .",
    "all of these results follow from a straightforward analysis of the actions ( [ sigmabtod ] ) and ( [ lsigma2 ] ) in @xmath0 . + ( _ iv _ ) a few remarks about the universality class of the phase transition between phases b and e. the theory ( [ lsigma2 ] ) should continue to apply .",

    "+ ( _ v _ ) the phase transition between phase a and phase e is always expected to be first - order . the quantum paramagnetic phase a has no gapless excitations and a vanishing spin susceptibility .",
    "it is then difficult to conceive of a mechanism which could lead to a continuous condensation of the field @xmath113 in an action like ( [ landau ] ) and ( [ lsigma1 ] ) ( or ( [ landaum ] ) for @xmath470 ) : integrating out the @xmath471 fluctuations does not yield a negative contribution to the `` mass '' , @xmath472 , of the @xmath113 field , as the spin susceptibility is zero .",
    "the phase diagram is shown in fig  [ q1 ] .",
    "all of the phases are identical to those discussed above for @xmath462 .",
    "the only difference is in the behavior of the first - order line surrounding phase a : it bends down towards the origin of the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane , as the minimum possible value of the single site angular momentum always forces in quantized ferromagnetic phases for @xmath25 small enough .      the phase diagram is shown in fig  [ qh ] .",
    "the topology is now similar to the positive integer case , as are the phases b and e , and the transitions between them .",
    "the primary difference is that the quantum paramagnet a has been replaced by a critical phase f , which has no broken symmetries and power - law decay of all observables .",
    "fluctuations in phase f are described by the @xmath465 dimensional @xmath2 non - linear sigma model with a topological term with coefficient @xmath474 : this mapping follows from the analysis of ref  @xcite .",
    "finally , we make a few remarks on the transition between the critical phase f and the partially polarized ferromagnet e. as f has gapless excitations , this transition can be continuous .",
    "a ( strongly - coupled ) field theory for this transition is given by the action @xmath119 in ( [ landaum ] ) , supplemented by the constraints ( [ constraintsm ] ) and a topological term at @xmath475 in the unit - vector @xmath471 field . an alternative , hamiltonian point - of - view on the same transition is the following .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the critical @xmath465 dimensional @xmath2 non - linear sigma model is equivalent to the @xmath476 wess - zumino - witten model  @xcite at level @xmath477 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath478 where @xmath479 are the @xmath476 currents obeying a kac - moody algebra .",
    "we now want to induce a ferromagnetic moment into the ground state of this theory .",
    "the action ( [ landaum ] ) does this by coupling in a fluctuating magnetic field @xmath113 .",
    "such a field would couple here to the magnetization @xmath480 : integrating out @xmath113 would then induce a coupling @xmath481 which gives us the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath482 the model @xmath483 can also be used to describe the onset of ferromagnetism in an itinerant luttinger liquid .",
    "it has in fact been examined earlier by affleck  @xcite , where he obtained it as an effective model for the spin degrees of freedom in a @xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "affleck examined the rg flows of @xmath252 for small @xmath252 and obtained @xmath484 . in the mapping from the repulsive hubbard model , and also from our rotor model , the initial sign of @xmath252 is positive . from ( [ lflow ] ) , affleck concluded that @xmath252 is irrelevant for all positive @xmath252 , and that all such systems flow into the @xmath485 fixed point .",
    "we believe this conclusion is incorrect .",
    "it is clear from our arguments that for @xmath252 large enough , @xmath483 should undergo a phase transition to ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this suggests that there is a critical value of @xmath486 ( with @xmath487 and of order unity ) such that only systems with @xmath488 flow into the @xmath485 fixed point .",
    "systems with @xmath489 are in the ferromagnetic phase e. the nature of the critical point at @xmath486 , which controls the transition from phase f to e , is unknown : determining its structure remains an important open problem .",
    "this paper has introduced and analyzed the simplest model with heisenberg symmetry which exhibits zero temperature phase transitions , and whose phases contain a net average magnetic moment .",
    "the model contained only bosonic quantum rotor degrees of freedom and offers the simplest realization of a quantum transition with an order parameter which is also a non - abelian , conserved charge .",
    "the analysis focussed primarily on the hamiltonian @xmath30 in ( [ hrotor ] ) , although variations were also considered .",
    "the results are summarized in the phase diagrams in figs  [ phasediag1]-[qh ] .    some important properties of these phase diagrams deserve reiteration . notice that for @xmath52 , there is no phase which is simply a non - quantized ferromagnet , with no other broken symmetry .",
    "phase d has a non - quantized ferromagnetic moment , but it has an additional long - range order in the @xmath82 field in a plane perpendicular to the ferromagnetic moment .",
    "we believe this is a generic feature of insulating spin systems : ferromagnetic ground states either have an integral or half - integral magnetic moment , or have an additional broken symmetry . only in @xmath0",
    "does a phase like e appear : it has a non - quantized ferromagnetic moment , and is invariant under rotations about the ferromagnetic axis .",
    "however , even in @xmath0 there is a remnant of the broken symmetry in the @xmath82 field perpendicular to the moment : correlators of @xmath82 have a power - law decay in space , and the linearly - dispersing gapless spin - wave mode is still present ( in addition to the usual quadratically dispersing ferromagnetic mode ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that metallic , fermi liquids of course have no trouble forming non - quantized ferromagnets ; this is in keeping with popular wisdom that fermi liquids are `` effectively '' one dimensional .",
    "a second interesting property of the phase diagram was pointed out in section  [ intro ] : continuous zero temperature transitions in which there is an onset in the ferromagnetic moment only occur from phases which have gapless excitations .",
    "thus there is such an onset from phase c ( which has gapless spin waves ) to phase d , but no continuous transition between phases a and d.    we also examined the critical properties of the second order phase transitions in the model . in several cases ,",
    "the critical theories turned out to be variations on the theme of a simpler quantum phase transition : the onset of density in a bose gas with repulsive interactions as its chemical potential is moved through zero .",
    "this quantum transition had been studied earlier  @xcite .",
    "because of its central importance , we obtained some additional results on its @xmath8 universal properties in appendix  [ appcalc ] .    in the remainder of this section , we remark on issues related to those considered in this paper , but which we have not directly analyzed here .",
    "we discuss implications of our results for quantum phase transitions in ferromagnetic fermi liquids .",
    "as noted in section  [ intro ] , there are two quantum transitions in this system , and we will discuss them separately : ( _ i _ ) consider first the transition from a fully polarized fermi liquid to a partially polarized fermi liquid .",
    "this is rather like the transition from phase b to phase d in @xmath52 , and the transition from phase b to phase e in @xmath0 .",
    "let us suppose that all electrons in the fully polarized state are polarized in the ` up ' direction .",
    "then an order parameter for the transition is simply the density of ` down ' spin electrons . along the lines of the analysis in the rotor model",
    ", we can derive an effective action for the down spin electrons simply by integrating out the up electrons .",
    "it turns out that the up electrons only mediate irrelevant interactions between the down electrons : the effective action for the down electrons is simply that of a dilute gas of _ free _ spinless fermions  @xcite . a possible four - point interaction like the @xmath490 term for the bose gas",
    "is prohibited by fermi statistics ; further a singular term , like that appearing in the models without @xmath41 symmetry in section  [ secrgbtod]b , appears to be prohibited here because the large fermi momentum of the up electrons inhibits strong mixing with down electrons via emission of ferromagnetic spin waves .",
    "the properties of the free spinless fermion model are of course trivial , but it is quite useful to re - interpret them in the language of a quantum phase transition  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note here that the critical theory of free spinless fermions in @xmath0 is identical to that of dilute interacting bosons for the b to e transition in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this is in keeping with our assertion that in @xmath0 , the transitions in itinerant fermion systems are in the same universality class as those in certain rotor models .",
    "( _ ii _ ) consider now the onset of ferromagnetism in an unpolarized fermi liquid .",
    "a theory for this transition for @xmath52 was proposed by hertz  @xcite .",
    "this transition is similar to the transition between phases c and d studied in section  [ ctod ] . in the end , our analysis used a method very close in spirit to that use by hertz : simply integrate out all gapless modes not directly related to the order parameter .",
    "we have provided here some independent justification for such an approach in the rotor model , and our results provide support for the correctness of hertz s analysis for @xmath52 . precisely in @xmath0",
    ", we have no theory for the transition between phases f and e , but we have argued that it should be in the same universality class as that of the onset of ferromagnetism in a luttinger liquid of itinerant electrons . the critical theory of this transition is the main remaining open problem in the theory of phase transitions in quantum ferromagnets .",
    "essentially all the analysis of this paper was at @xmath8 , and it would be interesting to extend it to finite @xmath6 .",
    "the finite @xmath6 properties of the quantum paramagnetic phase a , the nel phase c , and the transition between them , have already been studied in some detail  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a field - theoretic analysis of the finite @xmath6 properties above a quantized ferromagnetic state b has appeared  @xcite .",
    "it remains , therefore , to study the canted phase d and its phase transitions at finite @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the transition between the b and d phase is similar ( although not identical ) to that in a dilute bose gas  @xcite  the finite @xmath6 analysis should therefore be related to that in ref  @xcite .",
    "the finite @xmath6 properties of the phase d itself should also be quite interesting , especially in @xmath491 where the long - range order disappears at any finite @xmath6 .",
    "this is also the case of direct relevance to the quantum hall effect experiments of ref  @xcite .",
    "the phase d could be modeled _",
    "e.g. _ by the action ( [ sigmabtod ] ) , supplemented by the additional constraint @xmath492 , which can be imposed once we are well away from phase b.      at @xmath8 , but in the presence of randomness , one might expect that between the quantized ferromagnetic ( b ) and canted phases ( d ) , there occurs a `` canted glass '' phase with a non - quantized magnetic moment , short - range mean nel correlations , but a diverging mean nel susceptibility ; this can be seen by arguments analogous to those in ref  @xcite .",
    "further , general arguments  @xcite imply that for arbitrarily weak randomness in @xmath493 and for sufficiently strong randomness in @xmath225 , all the first order lines in our phase diagram are replaced by second - order transitions ( implying , for instance , the absence of direct transitions between the quantized ferromagnetic phases ) .",
    "we thank a. chubukov and n. read for useful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by nsf grant no .",
    "dmr-92 - 24290 .",
    "consider a ` double layer ' model of spin @xmath494 heisenberg spins @xmath495 , @xmath496 on the sites @xmath11 of a @xmath1 dimensional lattice ; @xmath46 are two ` layer ' indices and @xmath497 are vector components .",
    "we study the hamiltonian @xmath498 where @xmath22 is a sum over nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "we will consider the case where @xmath499 is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath500 ) .",
    "then , neglecting the inter - site terms , each site has a tower of states with total angular momentum @xmath501 .",
    "this tower is very similar to that of a single quantum rotor , the main difference being that the latter does not have an upper bound on its allowed angular momentum .",
    "for the low energy properties of interest in this paper , the upper bound is not expected to be important .",
    "further , by constructing an on - site hamiltonian which is a polynomial in @xmath502 ( @xmath33 is the rotor angular momentum ) , it is possible to mimic the actual eigenenergies of the tower of states in the heisenberg system .    now consider the inter - site terms in @xmath503 .",
    "for the on - site tower , the matrix elements of the rotor operators @xmath33 and @xmath32 are similar to those of @xmath504 and @xmath505 respectively ( @xmath506 is some constant ) ; this correspondence becomes exact in the semiclassical theory .",
    "so we perform the replacement @xmath507 , @xmath508 in @xmath509 .",
    "this yields precisely the inter - site terms in ( [ hrotor ] ) with @xmath510 note that in systems with a layer interchange symmetry ( @xmath511 ) , the coupling @xmath27 vanishes .",

    "follow as the special case @xmath251 .    at the critical point ,",
    "the propagator of ( [ actionmneq0 ] ) is ( dropping the @xmath532 subscripts on the couplings ) @xmath533 where @xmath534 the order @xmath535 contribution to the self energy is therefore @xmath536 after a lengthy , but straightforward , evaluations of the above integral we find , to leading order in @xmath229 : @xmath537 the renormalization constants @xmath90 , @xmath234 , and @xmath395 in ( [ zvalues ] ) follow immediately from the above result .    similarly , the four - point vertex is @xmath538 which leads to the result for @xmath233 in ( [ zvalues ] ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath396 is very similar , and details are omitted .",
    "in this appendix we will study the bose gas described by the action @xmath539 this action undergoes a @xmath8 quantum phase transition , at @xmath540 , which plays an important role in the models considered in the main part of this paper . in @xmath228 , this quantum transition obeys a _ no scale - factor universality _",

    "the dimensionless number @xmath303 is arbitrary , and no universal quantity should depend upon it ; we shall keep track of the @xmath303 dependence as a check on the universality of our final results .",
