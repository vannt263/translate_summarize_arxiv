    "the significant attention was paid during the last years on investigation of the nonlinear coherent phenomena in the anisotropic media@xmath0 .",
    "distinctive feature of such the media is that the stationary states of quantum particles being contained in them possess no the parity .",
    "for this reason , the diagonal elements of the matrix of the dipole moment operator and their difference commonly referred to as permanent dipole moment ( pdm ) of the transition are distinct from zero .",
    "the study of the formation and dynamics of electromagnetic pulses in the anisotropic media has great practical importance .",
    "modern technologies give an opportunity to produce the semiconductor crystals with properties varying over a wide range .",
    "for example , an anisotropic medium , in which the modulus of the ratio between pdm and corresponding off - diagonal matrix element of the dipole moment operator lies for different quantum transitions within the limits from 0.15 up to 7.1 , is resulted in work@xmath1 . besides , one of the persistent trends in developing the laser physics is to obtain the most shorter pulses@xmath2 .",
    "the role of pdm in the second harmonic generation in asymmetric semiconductor quantum wells was recognized and extensively studied ( see , e.g.,@xmath1 and references therein ) .",
    "its relative influence on the conversion efficiency increases for larger pump / harmonic wavelengths , especially at higher pump powers .",
    "also , propagation in the resonant optically uniaxial media of the two - component electromagnetic pulses consisting of the short - wavelength ordinary and long - wavelength extraordinary components was investigated in@xmath3 .",
    "it was revealed that , in the conditions of strong interaction between the components , pulses can pass through the anisotropic medium in the modes distinct from the self - induced transparency .",
    "the propagation of one - component extremely short electromagnetic pulses of femtosecond durations through the media having pdm was considered in works@xmath4 . as opposite to the ultrashort pulses ,",
    "a high - frequency carrier wave is absent in the fourier spectrum of such the pulses .",
    "it was noted in@xmath5 that nonzero pdm may have a strong effect on the medium response for very short pulses , while an application of the usual scheme of the rotating - wave approximation eliminates its influence in the longer pulses case .",
    "complete integrability of the reduced equations for the two - level medium with pdm in the frameworks of the inverse scattering transformation method@xmath6 was established in paper@xmath7 .",
    "the pulse solutions of these equations on constant ( but not arbitrary ) background were obtained .",
    "the background was chosen in such a manner that the problem considered was reduced to the isotropic medium case .",
    "dynamics of these pulses at the pump presence was considered in@xmath8 .",
    "the system of the full maxwell  bloch equations was studied in work@xmath9 , where stationary extremely short pulses decaying exponentially and algebraically were found .",
    "an asymmetry caused by pdm on the polarity of these pulses was revealed .",
    "also , the effects of passing the extremely short pulses with a duration up to several oscillations of electromagnetic field through a medium possessing pdm were investigated numerically@xmath10 .",
    "it was shown that there exists solitary stable bipolar signal with a nonzero time area ( nonzero breather ) .",
    "the recent results summarized above make valuable to clarify the role of pdm in the formation the one - component pulses of the self - induced transparency ( including , the extremely short pulses and ultrashort ones as the limiting cases ) . in present report",

    "let s consider optically uniaxial medium , whose anisotropy is created by the electric field .",
    "it splits the energy levels owing to the stark effect , retaining the degeneration of electronic levels on the absolute value of projection @xmath11 of the total angular momentum .",
    "thus , @xmath12-transition ( @xmath13 ) and doubly degenerate @xmath14-transitions ( @xmath15 ) are formed in an electronic subsystem .",

    "suppose that only the extraordinary component @xmath18 of its electric field , which is parallel to @xmath17 axis , is distinct from zero .",
    "one can show that such the pulse will interact with the @xmath12-transition only . the system of reduced maxwell ",

    ", we ignore the relaxation and inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral line of resonant absorption .    system ( [ 1])([3 ] ) coincides with the reduced maxwell ",
    "bloch equations for the isotropic media@xmath19 if @xmath32 .",
    "one can see that the extraordinary component of electric field fulfills here two functions : it causes the quantum transitions and , simultaneously , shifts dynamically their frequency . in the case of the two - component pulses@xmath3 , these functions were executed by its short - wavelength ordinary and long - wavelength extraordinary components accordingly . in so doing ,",
    "the ordinary component generated extraordinary one due to pdm of the resonant @xmath14-transitions .",
    "it is convenient for subsequent consideration to introduce new variables @xmath33 then , equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) are rewritten as @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37    an integrability of equations ( [ rmb1])([rmb3 ] ) with arbitrary parameter @xmath38 in the frameworks of the inverse scattering transformation method@xmath6 was revealed in@xmath39 .",

    "constant @xmath59 is an initial population of the quantum level ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the formulas for variables @xmath61 and @xmath14 are cumbersome and omitted .",

    "quantities @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which characterize the frequency and duration of the pulse , can be regarded as its free parameters instead of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , one finds from equations ( [ omega_t ] ) @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 here the arithmetic root is taken in the definition of @xmath69 , and the signs of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are chosen in such a manner that @xmath72 . without loss of a generality , we shall suppose in the sequel that parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( or @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are positive . if @xmath73 , then solution ( [ u_br ] ) is nothing but the pulse with higher - frequency filling ( ultrashort pulse ) , while at @xmath74 variable @xmath49 may no change the polarity as it happens for the extremely short pulses .",
    "expanding the right - hand side of equation ( [ u_br ] ) in the taylor series at a neighborhood of point @xmath75 and retaining the first two terms , we come to formulas @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80 it follows from the expressions presented that the modulus of the fourier transform of @xmath81 achieves the maxima on odd harmonics of the basic frequency @xmath63 , while the modulus of the fourier transform of @xmath82 has them on even harmonics , including zeroth one . since the generation of the secondary harmonics due to pdm is nonlinear effect , they are more localized at the center of the pulse . in the case of breather - like pulses , an asymmetry induced by pdm manifests itself in that the signs of @xmath38 and the zero harmonic are opposite .",
    "similar asymmetry on the polarity of a signal for the extremely short pulses was revealed under analytical and numerical investigations in@xmath83 .",
    "the conclusions made above are most obvious for the pulses with slowly varying envelope",
    ". indeed , if condition @xmath73 holds , then formulas ( [ u_0 ] ) and ( [ u_1 ] ) become simpler : @xmath84 @xmath85 carrying out the fourier transform with expressions ( [ u_0_sve ] ) and ( [ u_1_sve ] ) : @xmath86 one obtains @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath94 .",

    "the width of the spectral lines is equal to @xmath99 , while the maximum values of @xmath100 are proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "thus , an efficiency of the secondary harmonic generation grows with reducing the carrier frequency of the pulse .",
    "this agrees with the results of the previous studies ( see , e.g.,@xmath1 ) .",
    "an influence of pdm on the pulses having the high - frequency filling is weak .",
    "this is due to the fact that an average value of the frequency detuning @xmath102 ( see formula ( [ rmb2 ] ) ) on the duration of such the pulse tends to zero .",
