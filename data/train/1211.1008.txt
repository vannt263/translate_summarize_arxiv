    "we computed for the high - mass ( red triangles ) and low - mass ( green squares ) subsamples and for the full sample ( dashed bars ) .",
    "generally , high - mass halos have larger at @xmath85  kpc with increasing significance as @xmath86 is lowered . note that , for @xmath87  kpc , low - mass halos have @xmath88 for all @xmath86 , whereas high - mass halos have @xmath890.1 .    in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fdbar ] , we plot , the cgm covering fraction in a @xmath7 bin with @xmath90 .",
    "we find that for high- and low - mass halos are statistically identical ; has no mass dependence for all @xmath86 at all @xmath7 .",
    "using the median fit between @xmath4 and @xmath91 obtained by @xcite , each @xmath86 converts to a mean minimum neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "however , we caution that we extrapolated below the minimum @xmath4 of their fit ( @xmath45   ) .",
    "the combined behavior of and strongly suggests that the absorbing cgm is self - similar with halo mass over the range @xmath92 .",
    "if so , in a fixed @xmath6 bin , the higher values for higher mass halos is naturally explained by the fact that the cgm of higher mass halos is probed at smaller @xmath7 , whereas lower mass halos are probed at larger @xmath7 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fdmax - mall ] , we present versus @xmath53 , where is the cgm covering fraction within impact parameter @xmath6 with @xmath93 .",
    "we computed for both proper coordinates ( black points ) and for co - moving coordinates ( open blue points ) .",
    "the behavior of is not sensitive to the choice of coordinates .",
    "we find that shows no definitive trend with @xmath0 , being consistent with a constant value within errors .",
    "we also computed , the cgm covering fraction within @xmath94 with @xmath93 .",
    "we plot versus @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : fdmaxmrv ] .",
    "again , a suggestion of self - similarity of the absorbing cgm is apparent ; is effectively constant with halo mass within errors , primarily depending on @xmath86 and the @xmath7 cut . though a suggestion decreasing with increasing @xmath0 is visually apparent , non - parametric rank correlation tests",
    "indicate that no correlation with @xmath0 is consistent with the data ( null hypothesis satisfied within @xmath95@xmath96 ) .",

    "the substantial scatter about the @xmath4@xmath6 anti - correlation is explained by a systematic segregation of halo mass on the @xmath4@xmath6 plane . with @xmath9 significance ,",

    "the combined behavior of @xmath4 versus @xmath7 , , and strongly suggests that the absorbing cgm is self - similar with halo mass over the range @xmath100 .",
    "the covering fraction is constant with @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the covering fraction is a constant with @xmath0 for all @xmath86 and @xmath7 cuts .",
    "the magnitude of the covering fraction depends only on @xmath86 and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 cuts , decreasing with increasing @xmath101 for fixed @xmath6 cut and with increasing @xmath6 cut for fixed @xmath86 .",

    "this behavior is in direct conflict with theoretical expectations of cold - mode accretion .",
    "if the absorbing cgm is self - similar with halo mass , it would imply that in cold gas is also self - similar with halo mass .",
    "if cold - mode accretion substantially diminishes above some @xmath103 @xcite , our results imply that the absorbing cgm must be sustained by other mechanisms in @xmath22 halos .",
    "a most obvious candidate is outflows , which are observed in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "simulations indicate recycling time scales on the order of 0.51.0 gyr that decrease with increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , galaxies in higher mass halos with quiescent star formation for longer than @xmath104 yr would not be expected to have detectable or strong absorption ( c.f .",
    "on the other hand , since the number of sub - halos increases in proportion to halo mass @xcite , it is plausible that absorption from sub - halos counteracts our ability to observe the cut off of cold - mode accretion in the central halos with @xmath105 .",
    "alternatively , the theoretical prediction that cold - mode accretion universally diminishes in higher mass halos may not be correct .    since @xmath106 and @xmath107",

    "that is , @xmath110 for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath111 for fixed @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the halo mass segregation we observe on the @xmath4@xmath6 plane , and is corroborated by the @xmath4-stellar mass correlation reported by @xcite for starburst galaxies and the stellar mass dependence on the halo cross section of absorbing gas @xcite .",
