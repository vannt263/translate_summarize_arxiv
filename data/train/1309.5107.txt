    "a fundamental observation from physics is that the spectral statistics of disordered quantum systems exhibit universal patterns . in the delocalized regime and on the microscopic energy scale of individual eigenvalues ,",
    "the correlation functions exhibit the celebrated wigner - dyson - mehta statistics , which depend only on the basic symmetry class of the model . above a certain critical energy scale @xmath2 , called the _ thouless energy _ , the correlations of the spectral density exhibit a different type of statistics , first predicted by altshuler and shklovskii in @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is only present in systems possessing a nontrivial spatial structure that gives rise to quantum diffusion .",
    "the first altshuler - shklovskii formula states that the variance of the number of eigenvalues @xmath3 in a spectral window of size @xmath4 about an energy @xmath5 behaves according to @xmath6 the second altshuler - shklovskii formula states that the correlation function in the regime @xmath7 behaves according to @xmath8 in this work and in its companion paper @xcite , we prove the altshuler - shklovskii formulas for a specific type of disordered quantum systems : random band matrices with independent entries .",
    "random band matrices interpolate between the mean - field wigner matrices and random schrdinger operators @xcite .",
    "they have a sufficiently rich spatial structure to be diffusive ( for a proof see @xcite ) , and are more amenable to rigorous analysis than random schrdinger operators .",
    "the detailed physical background of the problem and related mathematical works are presented in section 1 of the companion paper @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "here we only explain how this paper is related to its companion @xcite .",
    "the main tool in both papers is a diagrammatic expansion technique .",
    "the correlation functions are expressed as a sum of many terms , which can be conveniently represented using graphs .",
    "the resulting expansion is highly oscillatory : the sum of the absolute values diverges rapidly , although the sum itself remains bounded . to handle the oscillations , we apply two different resummation procedures before the resummed diagrams can be estimated individually in absolute value .",
    "the first resummation is performed using an expansion in chebyshev polynomials , and is motivated by the work @xcite . in the jargon of diagrammatic perturbation theory , this resummation step corresponds to the self - energy ( or tadpole ) renormalization .",
    "a similar resummation was used in @xcite to analyse the quantum diffusion of the unitary propagator . the quantity studied in the current paper  the local density - density correlation  is considerably more difficult to analyse because it arises from higher - order terms than the quantum diffusion .",
    "hence , not only does the leading term have to be analysed more precisely , but the error estimates also require a more careful analysis .",
    "most importantly , even for the error terms we need a second resummation , which bundles specific families of diagrams ( so - called ladder graphs ) that are strongly oscillatory . hence , apart from a few basic algebraic tools on nonbacktracking powers , the argument of the current paper is entirely different from the one in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we introduced the necessary diagrammatic representation ; for the convenience of the reader , we give a short summary of it in section  [ sec_41 ] . with the diagrams at hand ,",
    "the proof can be divided into two parts : ( i ) estimating all subleading diagrams , and ( ii ) analysing the asymptotics of the leading diagrams .",
    "most diagrams give rise to error terms , in the sense that they do not contribute in leading order . estimating them , using the two resummation procedures sketched above , constitutes part ( i )  the first , and most challenging , part of the proof .",
    "this estimate is presented in @xcite under some simplifying assumptions in order to highlight the main ideas .",
    "the argument of @xcite also singles out eight distinguished diagrams ( after all of the resummations have been performed ) that contribute in leading order . in section",
    "[ sec : part 2 ] , we give the complete estimates in part ( i ) by removing the simplifying assumptions made in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the asymptotic analysis of the leading diagrams ( called part ( ii ) above ) takes up most of section [ sec:3 ] of this paper . to ease readability",
    ", we strive to keep this paper self - contained ; in particular , when needed we review the setup and key notations introduced in @xcite .",
    "we refer back to @xcite only for a few explicit results , whose content we explain here .",
    "our main theorems on the altshuler - shklovskii formulas are stated in section [ sec : unimodular_results ] . in sections [ sec :",
    "clt_result ] and [ sec : gen1 ] we give two generalizations of our results , which are proved in section [ sec : generalizations ] .    in our first generalization , given in section [ sec : clt_result ] , we prove that the finite - dimensional marginals of mesoscopic eigenvalue densities agree asymptotically with those of a gaussian process whose covariance is given by the altshuler - shklovskii formulas .",
    "thus , high - order correlation functions factorize into two - point correlation functions .",
    "this may be interpreted as a central limit theorem for the mesoscopic eigenvalue densities .    in our second generalization ,",
    "given in section [ sec : gen1 ] , we consider a family of general random band matrices whose entries @xmath9 have arbitrary translation - invariant variances , i.e.  @xmath10 for some profile function @xmath11 .",
    "we find that density - density correlation depends on the matrix entries only through @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath12 the leading and subleading terms of the density - density correlation are universal , for @xmath13 only the leading terms are universal , and for @xmath14 the density - density correlation is not universal .",
    "the leading terms depend only on the second moments of @xmath11 , while the subleading terms depend in addition on the fourth moments of @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the general model from section [ sec : gen1 ] interpolates between real symmetric @xmath0 and complex hermitian @xmath1 models , and hence allows us to track the transition for the mesoscopic density - density correlation .",
    "the basic algebraic identity used in the first resummation ( see below ) is much simpler if the matrix entries are constant in absolute value ( unimodular case ) ; the proof in @xcite and in section  [ sec : part 2 ] are presented in this case .",
    "the general band matrix model from section [ sec : gen1 ] generates additional terms in the basic identity ( compare with ) ; they have an ultimately negligible contribution , but nevertheless give rise to structurally new diagrams .",
    "their treatment substantially complicates the analysis . in the proof of the quantum diffusion ,",
    "these complications were carefully treated in @xcite , where we extended the analysis of @xcite from the unimodular case to the general case . in section  [ sec : general_proof ] we sketch how to extend the current analysis of the correlation functions from unimodular case to the general one .",
    "moreover , in section  [ sec : heavy tail ] we explain how our analysis can also be applied to a special one - dimensional band matrix model which exhibits _ critical behaviour _ , in the sense that is supposed to lie at the metal - insulator transition point .",
    "we compute the so - called _ compressibility _ of the mesoscopic eigenvalue statistics for this critical model , and find that it coincides with the prediction from the physics literature .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : mean - field ] we explain how to extend our results to include the _ mean - field regime _ @xmath15 in addition to the _ diffusive regime _",

    "we shall investigate two regimes : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in the former regime , we prove that the correlation decay in the energy difference @xmath83 is universal ( in particular , independent of @xmath72 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 ) , and we compute the correlation function explicitly . in the latter regime , we prove that the variance has a universal dependence on @xmath72 , and depends on @xmath84 and @xmath85 via their inner product in a homogeneous sobolev space .",
    "the case * ( c2 ) * for the test functions is the more interesting one , since it corresponds to local densities on a definite scale .",
    "the heavy tail of the cauchy kernel * ( c1 ) * introduces unwanted correlations from the overlap of the test functions .",
    "nevertheless , we give our results for the specific case * ( c1 ) * as well since it corresponds to the imaginary part of the resolvent , a quantity often considered in the physics literature .",
    "moreover , the case * ( c1 ) * is pedagogically useful , since in that case the computation of the main term is considerably simpler .    throughout the following we use the quantities @xmath86 and @xmath87 interchangeably . without loss of generality",

    "we emphasize that this phase transition in the mesoscopic statistics does not coincide with the celebrated metal - insulator transition between the poisson and the wigner - dyson - mehta ( wdm ) behaviour for the microscopic eigenvalue statistics .",

    "the relation between the microscopic and mesoscopic statistics is in fact more intricate .",
    "we sketch it in the two following paragraphs .    in the diffusive regime",
    "the mesoscopic linear statistics are governed by the altshuler - shklovskii formulas irrespective of the microscopic statistics .",

    "this leads to additional terms for @xmath41 , which may be included in the argument of section [ sec : part 2 ] as follows .",

    "in defining the refining pairing @xmath643 of @xmath1171 as in section [ sec : refining_partition ] , we forgo the condition ( a ) of section [ sec : refining_partition ] by choosing the edge @xmath699 in step ( ii ) of @xmath690 to be simply the largest edge of @xmath698 ; otherwise the algorithm is unchanged .",

    "* section 5.1 ) .",
    "here we give a short summary .",
    "recall that the key observation behind the definition of a skeleton was that parallel straight bridges yield a large contribution but a small combinatorial complexity .",

    "the skeleton @xmath729 is obtained from @xmath644 by successively collapsing _ parallel straight bridges _ and _ antiparallel twisted bridges _ until none remains .",
    "we take over all notions from section [ sec_42 ] , such as @xmath1175 , with the appropriate straightforward modifications for tagged skeletons .",
    "as it turns out , allowing twisted bridges results in eight new dumbbell skeletons , called @xmath1176 below , each of which has the same value @xmath1175 as its counterpart without a tilde .",
    "they are defined in figure [ fig : antidumbbell ] .",
    "hence , for @xmath41 the leading term is simply twice the leading term of @xmath44 , which accounts for the trivial prefactor @xmath1177 in the final formulas .",
    "any other skeleton may be estimated by a trivial modification of the argument from sections [ sec : part 2 ] ; we omit further details .      in this subsection",
    "we outline how to prove the results of section [ sec : gen1 ] for general band matrices satisfying definition [ def : gen_band ] .",
    "the main difference is that , since @xmath49 is not unimodular as in section [ sec : setup1 ] , the key identity does not hold .",
