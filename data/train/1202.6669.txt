    "over the last decades , wireless communication proved to be an enabling technology to an increasingly large number of applications .",
    "the convenience of wireless and its support of mobility has revolutionized the way we access data , information services , and interact with the physical world . beyond enabling mobile devices to access information and data services ubiquitously ,",
    "wireless technology is widely used in cyber - physical systems such as air - traffic control , power plants synchronization , transportation systems , and human body implantable devices .",
    "this pervasiveness elevated wireless communication systems to the level of critical infrastructure .",
    "radio - frequency wireless communications occur over a broadcast medium , that is not only shared between the communicating nodes but is also exposed to adversaries .",
    "jamming is one of the most prominent security threats as it not only can lead to denial of service attacks , but can also be the prelude to spoofing attacks .    anti - jamming has been an active area of research for decades .",
    "various techniques for combating jamming have been developed at the physical layer  @xcite which include directional antennas , spread spectrum communication , power / modulation / coding control . at the time , most of the wireless communication were not packetized nor networked .",
    "reliable communication in the presence of adversaries regained significant interest in the last few years , as new jamming attacks and the need for more complex applications and deployment environments have emerged .",
    "several specifically crafted attacks and counter - attacks were proposed for packetized wireless data networks  @xcite , multiple access resolution  @xcite , multi - hop networks  @xcite , broadcast and control communication  @xcite , cross - layer resiliency  @xcite , wireless sensor networks  @xcite , spread - spectrum without shared secrets  @xcite , and navigation information broadcast systems  @xcite .    nevertheless , very little work has been done on protecting rate adaptation algorithms against adversarial attacks .",
    "rate adaptation plays an important role in widely used wireless communication systems such as ieee802.11 standard as the link quality in a wlan is often highly dynamic . in recent years",
    ", a number of algorithms for rate adaptation have been proposed in literature  @xcite , and some are widely deployed  @xcite .",
    "recently , rate adaptation for the widely used ieee 802.11 protocol was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical analysis of optimal jamming strategies against currently deployed rate adaptation algorithms indicate that ieee 802.11 can be significantly degraded with very few interfering pulses .",
    "the commoditization of software radios makes these attacks very practical and calls for investigation of the capacity of packetized communication under adaptive jamming .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the problem of determining the optimal rate control and adaptation mechanisms for a channel subject to a power constrained jammer .",
    "we consider a setup where a pair of nodes ( transmitter and receiver ) communicate using data packets . an adversary ( jammer )",
    "can interfere with the communication but is constrained by an instantaneous maximum power per packet ( @xmath1 ) and a long - run average power ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "appropriately coded packets can overcome interference and are lost otherwise . over - coding ( coding at low rates ) reduces the throughput , while under - coding ( coding at high rates ) increases the chances of loosing a packet .",
    "an important question is to understand the interaction between the communicating nodes and the adversary , determine the long - term achievable maximum throughput and the optimal strategy to achieve it , as well as the optimal strategy for the adversary . while , the capacity of a channel under a fixed - power jammer , and the optimal strategies for communication and jamming , derive from fundamental information theoretic results ( see section  [ sec : game_analysis ] ) , these questions are still open for a packetized communication system .",
    "our contribution can be summarized as follows :    * we formulate the interaction between the communicating nodes and an adversary within a game - theoretic context .",
    "we show the existence of the nash equilibrium for this non - typical game .",
    "we also show that the nash equilibrium strategies can be computed using linear programming .",
    "* we show that earlier information - theoretic capacity results for a jammed channel correspond to a pure nash equilibrium ( ne ) . *",
    "we further characterize the game by showing that , when both players are allowed to randomize their actions ( i.e. , coding rate and jamming power ) new mixed nash equilibria appear with surprising properties .",
    "we show the existence of a threshold ( @xmath0 ) such that if the jammer average power exceeds @xmath0 , the channel capacity at the ne is the same as if the jammer was using @xmath1 all the time .",
    "* we also show that the optimal ne strategies can be approximated by very simple ( e.g. , semi - uniform ) distributions . such strategies are very simple to implement in current hardware and software .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : system_model ] , we present our model for the communication link , communicating nodes and the adversary . in section [ sec : game_model ] , we introduce the players , the _ transmitter _ and",
    "the _ jammer _ , and their respective strategies and payoffs .",
    "we discuss how additional constraint on jammer s mixed strategy space makes our game model different from a typical zero - sum game . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we show that the nash equilibrium indeed exists .",
    "we also prove the existence of a threshold , @xmath0 , for the jammer and its effect on the game outcome . in section  [ sec : game_analysis ] , we study two particular cases . the case of a _ powerful jammer _ , when jammer s average power is greater than the threshold , and the case of a _ weak jammer _ , when jammer s average power is less than the threshold .",
    "we will also provide transmitter s optimal strategies in these two cases . in section  [ sec : continuous ] , we study the case where players have infinite number of pure strategies ( the continuous zero - sum game ) and finally",
    ", we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "in this section we introduce and define our system model .",
    "the overall system model is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the communication link between the transmitter and the receiver is an awgn channel with a fixed noise variance . beside the channel noise ,",
    "transmitted packets are being disrupted by an additive jammer .",
    "jammer s peak and average power are assumed to be limited to produce a more realistic model .",
    "the overall system model is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the communication link between the transmitter and the receiver is assumed to be a single - hop , additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with a fixed and known noise variance , @xmath3 , referred to the receiver s front end .",
    "furthermore , the communication link is being disrupted by an additive adversary , the _",
    "jammer_. the jammer transmits radio signals to degrade the capacity between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "we assume transmissions are _ packet - based _ ,",
    "i.e. , transmissions take place in disjoint time intervals during which transmitter s and jammer s state ( parameters ) remain unchanged .",
    "we assume packets are long enough that channel capacity theorem could be applied to each packet being transmitted , this is justified by today s internet protocols that use packet sizes of up to @xmath4 bytes .",
    "in section  [ sec : game_model ] we introduce and study a two - player zero - sum game in which transmitter - receiver goal is to achieve highest possible rate while jammer tries to minimize the achievable rate .",
    "radio jamming or simply _ jamming _ is deliberate transmission of radio signals with the intention of degrading a communication link .",
    "the effect of jammer on the communication link is reduction of the effective signal to noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver and hence decreasing the channel capacity .",
    "as long as reduction in effective signal to noise ratio is concerned , the jammer can use arbitrary random signals for transmission but , it can be shown @xcite that in the awgn channel with a fixed and known noise variance , a gaussian jammer with a flat power spectral density is the most effective in minimizing the the capacity between the transmitter and the receiver . in other words , in the communication game described above , the optimal strategy for the transmitter is to use a zero - mean white gaussian input with variance equal to @xmath5 , the transmitter power , and the best strategy for the jammer is is to use a similar distribution with variance @xmath6 , the jammer power .    a fairly large number of jamming models have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the most benign jammer is the _ barrage noise jammer_.",
    "the barrage noise jammer transmits bandlimited white gaussian noise with power spectral density ( psd ) of @xmath6 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the barrage noise jammer power spectrum covers exactly the same frequency range as the communicating system .",
    "this kind of jammer simply increases the gaussian noise level from @xmath3 to @xmath7 at the receiver s front end .",
    "another frequently used jamming model is the _ pulse - noise jammer_. the pulse noise jammer transmits pulses of bandlimited white gaussian noise having total average power of @xmath2 referred to the receiver s front end .",
    "it is usually assumed that the jammer chooses the center frequency and bandwidth of the noise to be the same as the transmitter s center frequency and bandwidth .",
    "the jammer chooses its pulse duty factor to cause maximum degradation to the communication link while maintaining the average jamming power @xmath2 . for a more realistic model",
    ", the pulse - noise jammer could be subject to a maximum peak power constraint .",
    "other jamming models , to name a few , are the _ partial - band jammer _ and _ single / multiple - tune jammer_.    however , we study a more sophisticated jamming model .",
    "the jammer in study is a reactive and additive jammer , i.e. , he is only active when a packet is being transmitted and silent otherwise .",
    "we assume that the jammer has a set of discrete jamming power levels uniformly distributed between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the jammer can choose any jamming power level given that he maintains an overall average jamming power , @xmath2 .",
    "the jammer uses his available power levels according to a distribution ( his strategy ) , he chooses an optimal distribution to minimize the achievable capacity of the communication link while maintaining his maximum and average power constraints , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .    for reasons given in section [ subsec : transmitter_model ] ,",
    "burst jamming ( transmitting a burst of white noise to disrupt a few bits in a packet ) is not an optimal jamming scheme .",
    "hence , we assume the jammer remains active during the entire packet transmission , i.e. , the jammer transmits a continuous gaussian noise with a fixed variance @xmath10 $ ] for each transmitting packet .",
    "transmitter has a rate adaptation block which enables him to transmit at different rates .",
    "popular techniques to increase or decrease the rate of a code are puncturing or extending . puncturing and extending increase the flexibility of the system without significantly increasing its complexity .",
    "considering jammer s activity , the transmitter changes his rate according to a distribution ( his strategy ) . changing the rate",
    "can be accomplished using techniques like rate - compatible puncturing .",
    "the transmitter chooses an optimal distribution to achieve the best possible average rate ( payoff ) .",
    "same as before , we assume transmissions are _ packet - based _",
    ", i.e. , transmissions are taken place in disjoint time intervals during which , transmitter s rate remain unchanged .",
    "transmitter s model is shown in figure  [ fig : transmitter ] .",
    "the interleaver block in transmitter s model is a countermeasure to burst errors and burst jamming .",
    "interleaving is frequently used in digital communications and storage devices to improve the burst error correcting capabilities of a code .",
    "burst errors are specially troublesome in short length codes as they have very limited error correcting capabilities . in such codes",
    ", a few number of errors could result in a decoding failure or an incorrect decoding .",
    "a few incorrectly decoded codewords within a larger frame could make the entire frame corrupted .",
    "fortunately , combining effective interleaving schemes such as cryptographic interleaving and capacity - achieving codes such as turbo codes and ldpc codes results in transmission schemes that have good burst error correcting properties ( see @xcite ) which make burst jamming ineffective .",
    "therefore , in our study we do not consider burst jamming and instead assume that the jammer remains active during the entire packet transmission .",
    "in this section we discuss the game setup in detail ; we introduce and define the players , their respective strategies and the constraints in the game .",
    "we present the game model and define and formulate the payoff function in a game theoretic frame work .",
    "as discussed in section  [ subsec : jammer_model ] , in the awgn channel , the additive white gaussian jammer is the optimal jammer , in the sense that the white gaussian jammer minimizes the channel capacity .",
    "henceforward , we will only consider the additive gaussian jammer .",
    "we present the jammer s strategy set and introduce the jammer s average power constraint and its impact on the mixed strategy space .",
    "the additional constraint makes our game model different from a typical two - player zero - sum game .",
    "we also introduce transmitter s strategy set and define the game utility function and the payoff matrix .",
    "we begin by introducing a discrete version of the game to prove basic concepts and conclusions .",
    "generalization to the continuous case is given in section  [ sec : continuous ]      the jammer has the option to select discrete values of jamming power , uniformly distributed over @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we assume there are @xmath12 pure strategies available to the jammer .",
    "hence , the jammer s strategy set ( set of jamming powers ) , @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 we can write the possible jammer power levels in vector form , hence the jammer s pure strategies vector , @xmath16 , is @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates transposition and @xmath19 is defined in . unlike typical zero - sum games in which there are no other constraints on the mixed - strategies , in our model , the jammer s mixed - strategy must satisfy the additional average power constraint , @xmath20 .",
    "hence , in this model , not all mixed - strategies ( and not even the pure strategies that are greater than @xmath2 ) are feasible strategies ( * ? ? ?",
    "if we let @xmath21 be the jammer s mixed - strategy vector and @xmath22 be the @xmath12-simplex , we have the following relations : @xmath23 by using the jammer s pure strategy vector we define the constrained mixed strategy space @xmath24 as @xmath25 which is a subset of the @xmath26-simplex that satisfies the average power constraint . by substituting the equality constraint in with the less than or equal sign",
    ", we define a new mixed strategy space which consists of all mixed strategies that result in an average power less than or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the new mixed - strategy space , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 it is obvious that @xmath29    a typical mixed strategy space with equality constraint , as defined in , is shown in figure  [ fig : jammer_mixed_space ] where @xmath30 . in this case",
    "jammer s mixed and pure strategy vectors are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    since by introducing the new mixed strategy spaces of and we are eliminating some mixed strategies that could have been otherwise selected , the existence of the nash equilibrium for this case must be first established .",
    "this is unlike a typical zero - sum game with a finite number of pure strategies in which the existence of the nash equilibrium is assured . in section  [ subsec :",
    "nash_existence ] , we provide an outline of the proof of the existence of the nash equilibrium in our game where the jammer s mixed strategy space is limited to @xmath24 or @xmath27 .",
    "the transmitter strategy set is a set of discrete transmission rates corresponding to different assumed jamming power levels , i.e , the transmitter chooses his rate , @xmath33 , from the set @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the jammer s power level assumed by the transmitter .",
    "if the actual jammer s power level is less than or equal to the assumed value of @xmath36 , then transmission at rate @xmath37 is possible , otherwise reliable transmission is not possible , the packet is lost , and the actual transmission rate drops to zero .",
    "same as the case with the jammer , we define the vector of mixed - strategies for the transmitter , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41-simplex with no additional constraints .      the _ payoff _ to the transmitter is defined assuming transmissions at the channel capacity . defining the payoff based on channel capacity ( or other variations of channel capacity )",
    "is a common practice in the games involving a transmitter - receiver pair and an adversary @xcite .    because transmissions occur in the presence of an adversary , recovery of the transmitted information at the receiver is not always guaranteed .",
    "the information can only be recovered when the actual jamming power , @xmath6 , is less than or equal to the jamming power level assumed by the transmitter , @xmath42 , i.e. , if and only if @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 , the corresponding transmission rate would exceed the channel capacity and the information would be lost .",
    "therefore , the transmitter s payoff function is given by @xmath45 since the game in study is a zero - sum game , the payoff to the jammer is the negative of the transmitter s payoff .",
    "we can formulate the payoffs in a payoff matrix where the transmitter and the jammer would be the row and column players respectively .",
    "the resulting payoff matrix , @xmath46 , is @xmath47 where @xmath37 is defined in .",
    "the expected payoff ( or the game value ) of the game is @xmath48    in defining we have assumed @xmath49 .",
    "as discussed below , without loss of generality , we can always assume that @xmath50 .",
    "[ lem : n_t ] let @xmath46 be the payoff matrix in the two - player zero - sum game defined by the utility function .",
    "the payoff matrix resulted by removing the dominated strategies is a square lower triangular matrix with size less than or equal to @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , if the power levels were uniformly distributed over @xmath52 $ ] , the size of the non - dominated payoff matrix would be the minimum of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "assume the jammer s power levels are arbitrary distributed over some range , @xmath55 $ ] , and @xmath56 . a typical case where @xmath56 is depicted in figure [ fig : dominate_strategies ] ( top ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dominate_strategies ] , the transmitter s pure strategies are mapped to the jammer s power levels for better visualization . between some of the transmitter s pure strategies",
    "there might be a pure strategy of the jammer but since @xmath56 , according to the _ pigeonhole _ principle , between at least two of the transmitter s pure strategies ( not necessarily any two pure strategy as sketched ) there must be more than one jamming power level ( shown as dashed or solid lines ending in squares ) .",
    "any of these jamming power levels ( or pure strategies ) could be used to terminate the information transmitted by the rate corresponding to the power level immediately to the left of them ( shown as solid line ending in circles ) . from these pure strategies",
    ", a rational jammer would choose the one with the lowest power level ( the solid line ) and hence , it would dominate the rest ( dashed lines ) .",
    "therefore , the number of non - dominated pure strategies for the jammer is at most equal to the the number of the transmitter s pure strategies ( first part of the lemma ) .",
    "if the pure strategies were uniformly distributed over @xmath57 @xmath58 $ ] , as sketched , for every transmitter s pure strategy there would be exactly one non - dominated strategy for the jammer and hence , there would be no intention for the jammer to use more pure strategies than the transmitter .",
    "the same discussion can be given for the number of pure strategies a rational transmitter should use for the case @xmath59 ( see figure [ fig : dominate_strategies ] ( bottom ) ) .",
    "henceforward , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath50 .    as a consequence of lemma [ lem : n_t ] , in our study ,",
    "we need to consider only square matrices which simplifies further studies and assumptions . in the section that follows",
    ", we will study the outcome of the game when jammer s average power assumes different values .",
    "in this section , we study the basic properties of the game .",
    "we will show that although we have put an additional constraint on the jammer s mixed strategy space , the existence of the nash equilibrium is still guaranteed .",
    "furthermore , we will show that by randomizing his strategy , the jammer can force the transmitter to operate at his lowest rate , given that he uses an average jamming power , @xmath2 , that is more than a certain threshold , @xmath60 .",
    "we also provide an upper bound for @xmath0 in this section .",
    "we begin this section by the following lemma that shows existence of the nash equilibrium under the additional average power constraint is guaranteed .    for the two - player zero - sum game defined by the utility function @xmath61 , given in and the payoff matrix @xmath46 , given by and the transmitter s mixed strategy , @xmath62 , and the jammer s mixed strategy , @xmath63 ( defined in and , respectively ) , at least one nash equilibrium exists .",
    "nash in his 1951 seminal paper , `` non cooperative games '' @xcite , proved that for any game with finite set of pure strategies , there exists at least one ( pure or mixed ) equilibrium such that no player can do better by unilaterally deviating from his strategy . in the proof of the existence of the nash equilibrium",
    ", no additional constraints were assumed on the mixed strategy spaces .",
    "but , in our game model , we are assuming an additional constraint on the jammer s mixed strategy space ; the jammer must maintain a fixed or maximum average jamming power ( corresponding to and , respectively ) .",
    "these additional assumptions change the jammer s mixed strategy space from the n - simplex to a subset of it .",
    "therefore , the nash equilibrium theorem can not be applied to our model directly and the existence of the nash equilibrium must be established .",
    "the proof of the existence of nash equilibrium hinges on the _ sperner s lemma _ and _ brouwer s fixed point theorem _ and a corollary of this theorem on simplotopes .",
    "sperner s lemma applies to simplicially subdivided n - simplexes .",
    "it can easily be shown that by using a _ radial projection _",
    ", the mixed strategy space in our model , which is a result of additional constraint of maintaining an average jamming power ( or maintaining a maximum average power ) , can be projected to an appropriate lower dimension m - simplex where @xmath64 .",
    "a similar argument can be used to generalize the brouwer s fixed point theorem to any arbitrary convex and compact set . since the additional average power constraint does not effect the convexity or compactness of the mixed strategy space",
