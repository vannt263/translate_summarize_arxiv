    "based on a work with littlewood  @xcite , hardy  @xcite showed that  @xmath6 is not hlder continuous with exponent  @xmath37 at irrational numbers and at some rational numbers . using the continuous wavelet transform ( of  @xmath6 ) , holschneider and tchamitchian",

    "our approach is based on the continuous wavelet transform of  @xmath0 related to the lusin wavelet , and is similar to the ones used to obtain the hlder continuity of  @xmath6 in  @xcite .",
    "this method has two advantages : we can consider both the cases @xmath51 and @xmath49 to study the uniform hlder continuity of  @xmath0 and then show the optimality of the so obtained exponent . in other words , we calculate the uniform hlder exponent of  @xmath0 for @xmath48 .",
