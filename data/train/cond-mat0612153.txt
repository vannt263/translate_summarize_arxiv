    "various forms of topological entanglement play a fundamental role in determining equilibrium and dynamical properties of single chain and multi - chain polymeric systems  @xcite , with relevant consequences also for biological matter . for instance , the presence of a knot can be an obstacle to the processes of duplication and segregation of dna in bacterials  @xcite .",
    "indeed , there exist topoisomerase enzymes whose function is precisely that of controlling the topology of circular dna  @xcite .",
    "the knots and links which are ubiquitous in higher molecular multi - chain melts and solutions can profoundly affect properties of such systems like viscosity or resistance to rupture @xcite .",
    "knots can even be found in the native state of some proteins @xcite . and may play an important role in their stabilization with respect to denaturating agents and in their folding dynamics .",
    "the description of the consequences of topological entanglement in polymer physics poses theoretical and numerical challenges which only relatively recently started to be faced with some success @xcite @xcite .",
    "an interesting issue addressed in the last years is that of establishing whether knots tend to be `` spread '' over the whole polymer or `` localized '' within a short portion of the chain ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "if properly quantified , the degree of localization of ( prime ) knots is expected to play an important role in the discussion of both equilibrium and dynamical properties of knotted macromolecules .",
    "for example , if the knot is localized to some degree in a long ring , the logarithmic correction to the ring entropy per monomer should drastically change with respect to that of the unknotted case @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the knot could behave in such a way that its average `` length '' grows with the @xmath13-th power @xmath14 of the total ring length @xmath1 .",
    "corrections to scaling associated to this length should then be expected for the long chain behavior of measurable quantities like the gyration radius @xcite .",
    "these corrections should be detectable as peculiar of rings with prime knot , but could not be predicted within the framework of approaches like the field theoretical renormalization group , which treats only the case of  phantom \" ring polymers with unrestricted topology .",
    "the size of the knot in a dna ring should also strongly affect the action of topoisomerases or the mobility of the ring in gel electrophoresis experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments of dna micromanipulation by optical tweezers have shown that it is possible to tie specific knots into the macromolecule @xcite and to observe their motion within a viscous solution  @xcite .",
    "for this problem the knowledge of the length of the entangled region is essential , since it directly affects the knot diffusion coefficient @xcite .    in spite of some early indications that prime knots in ring polymers in good solvent are likely to be localized in small portions of the chain @xcite , sufficiently direct and quantitative evidence of this property remained for long a major challenge",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty of locating the knot of a closed curve in a consistent way .",
    "a possible procedure is that of isolating a trial open portion of the curve and of checking whether the new ring obtained by joining its extremes with a topologically `` neutral '' closure still contains the original knot , or not .",
    "the knot length should then be identified with that of the smallest portion for which the knot remains .",
    "such procedure relies on the notion of knotted arc that is not well defined mathematically @xcite . indeed , since knots are embeddings of _ circles _",
    "@xcite , in a strict mathematical sense no open string can be knotted : continous transformations acting on such string can always bring it into an untangled shape . for a general closed curve knottedness",
    "is a global property : we can not state that a portion is knotted , but only that the whole curve is ( fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we show here , when dealing with a whole sample of closed curve configurations the notion of knot length may acquire a physical meaning , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "[ figure2 ]    a definition of knot length may be much more easy to give for flat knots @xcite , i.e. knots in ring polymers that are confined in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "physical examples include polymer rings adsorbed on a plane by adhesive forces @xcite or macroscopic necklages flattened under gravity onto a vibrating plane @xcite .",
    "the configurations of such adsorbed rings would be similar to the planar projections used in knot theory to compute topological invariants and classify knots  @xcite .",
    "under the simplifying assumption that the number of overlaps is restricted to the minimum compatible with its topology ( for example 3 for the trefoil knot ) , the length of the hosted flat knot can be unambiguously defined and its statistical behavior , as a function of the number of monomers of the ring , can be studied analytically  @xcite and numerically @xcite . in the good solvent regime flat knots",
    "were found to be strongly localized .",
    "this approach has also been extended to polymer rings that undergo collapse from the swollen ( high temperature ) to the compact ( low temperature ) regime and it was found that globular flat knots are delocalized @xmath15 @xcite . however , the results on localization and delocalization of flat knots apply to a model which is a too crude representation of knots in three dimensions , which are the challenge here .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we reported a preliminary investigation of the size of knots in a flexible polymer ring fluctuating in equilibrium in 3d . by modelling the ring configurations as self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) on a cubic lattice , we could take fully into account excluded volume .",
    "thanks to the inclusion of short range attractive interactions , upon lowering the temperature @xmath16 , the polymer ring did undergo a collapse transition from a coil to a globule shape at the @xmath17 point temperature @xcite .    to measure the average size of the knots in the high temperature swollen regime , we followed two different methods @xcite .",
    "the first one was based on the cutting - closing strategy already outlined above . in order to test the consistency of the results we also adopted a completely new strategy based on the entropic competition between two knotted loops into which a ring can be partitioned by a slip link .",
    "if each one of the two loops contains , e. g. , a prime knot , one expects a dominance of equilibrium configurations in which one of the loops is entropically tightened , while the other one gains almost the whole length of the ring .",
    "it is then tempting to identify this form of tightening of the loop with the entropic tightening of the knot it contains .",
    "this last tightening could also be the same as that occurring within a singly knotted fluctuating ring .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we gave evidence that in the swollen regime prime knots are weakly localized with @xmath18 .",
    "this result was obtained with the two independent methods above , by fitting the power law behavior of the average knot length as a function of the total ring length .",
    "similar methods were subsequently applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to an off - lattice model of open polyethylene chain , obtaining results for the localization of the trefoil knot in qualitative agreement with ours .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is to address the issue of the consistency of the method of knot localization study based on cutting and closing and that based on entropic competition of loops more systematically , by testing other knot types and , most important , by analyzing more globally the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the knot length measured in the different cases .",
    "another purpose of the present work is that of investigating the issue of scaling corrections for ring polymers with fixed topology .",
    "recently , an attempt was made to infer the localization properties of prime knots from the scaling correction detected in the force - extension plots of knotted polymers whose extremes are subjected to a force @xcite . however , the results appeared consistent with a power law behavior of the average knot length rather different from those we detected in ref @xcite by our direct measurement .",
    "moreover , the correction estimated there appeared weaker than the correction predicted by the field theoretical renormalization group methods for a polymer with unrestricted topology .    a further result , first established in @xcite is that below the theta temperature , in the collapsed phase , knots are delocalized @xmath19 .",
    "this important conclusion , further supported by results in ref .",
    "@xcite , calls for a more systematic discussion in view of the relevance of topological entanglement in globular polymers and biopolymers .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model and some details of the methods of simulation .",
    "the direct measure method will be introduced in section iii and section iv , where we will discuss also how one can discuss the pdf of the knot length .",
    "section v is dedicated to the knot length evaluation based on the entropic competition between two loops .",
    "this second method is the only one safely applicable in the low temperature collapsed regime , and we will present the result obtained for this regime in a further section ( vi ) . in section vii , we discuss the implications that the weak localization of knots in good solvent has on the scaling behavior of the mean square radius of gyration of polymer rings and on its corrections .",
    "we close in section vii with a general discussion of the results .",
    "we model flexible ring polymers in good solvent by self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) on the cubic lattice , i.e. closed lattice walks whose steps can visit each edge and each vertex of the lattice at most once @xcite .",
    "whenever necessary we introduce in our model an attractive interaction potential which lowers the total energy by @xmath20 whenever two nearest - neighbor lattice sites are visited by non - consecutive vertices of the sap .",
    "this attractive interaction is sufficient to induce a theta collapse at sufficiently low temperature @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a configuration @xmath21 with @xmath22 nearest neighbor interactions is then @xmath23 .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this work we addressed the problem of localization of knots in flexible ring polymers modelled by saps on cubic lattice .    in the swollen regime",
    "we showed that a statistical method of prime knot length determination based on isolating different portions of the sap as candidates to host the knot is consistent with an alternative criterion , based on the entropic competition between two knotted loops within the same ring . by a systematic analysis of the moments of the knot length pdf of different knots",
    ", we gave strong indication that the localization of a prime knot is characterized by an exponent @xmath18 describing how the average length grows as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 could be universal for different prime knots , or even for composite knots whose components are tightened to remain close to each other in the same loop .",
    "we have shown that the weak localization of a prime knot in a swollen ring determines a peculiar scaling correction exponent @xmath24 for the asymptotic scaling of the radius of gyration .",
    "this exponent implies a stronger correction compared to that occurring for phantom ring polymers with unrestricted knot type .",
    "we think that recent works in the literature , addressing subtle issues concerning the scaling of polymer rings with fixed topology @xcite , could sharpen their conclusions by taking into account in the numerical analysis the different scaling correction identified here .",
    "a remarkable advantage of the method of entropic competition between knotted loops is the possibility of dealing with the collapsed regime without risking to suffer too strong systematic errors in the determination of the knot length .",
    "thanks to a systematic analysis of data we could conclude that both prime and composite knots fully delocalize in the globular phase , confirming a previous prediction by the authors of the present work @xcite .",
