    "in a wide range of astrophysical problems heat is transported by both radiation and convection .",
    "examples include stellar envelopes and stellar cores , where convection may be coupled with rotation , pulsation , and diffusion . to be useful",
    ", a convection model must be both manageable and reliable .",
    "local convection models satisfy both criteria but they are restricted to regions of strong to moderately strong convection , while in most cases one needs to model moderately strong to weak convection .    numerical simulations ( @xcite , and @xcite ) have been applied to 2d and 3d stellar atmospheres .",
    "their successful reproduction of spectral line profiles and solar granulation statistics has proved their reliability .",
    "however , they are restricted to layers near the stellar surface @xcite because of the huge thermal time scales characterizing stellar interiors .",
    "in addition , they currently are too expensive for applications such as non - linear stellar pulsation calculations for rr lyrae stars @xcite or for use in everyday spectrum synthesis of large wavelength ranges or large parameter sets for a  m stars .",
    "hence , they do not satisfy the criterion of manageability for the whole range of problems where convection occurs .",
    "convection models based on the non - local , hydrodynamic moment equations provide a possible alternative .",
    "they describe the moments of an ensemble average of the basic fields : velocity @xmath0 , temperature @xmath1 , and density @xmath2 ( or pressure @xmath3 ) .",
    "dynamic equations for the moments are derived directly from the fully compressible navier - stokes equations ( nse , @xcite ) .",
    "the `` ensemble '' used in this averaging process consists of realizations of solutions of the nse @xcite , or of `` convective elements '' of different velocity and temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the moment equations entail higher order moments and thus require closure assumptions . to obtain a closed set of equations most convection models",
    "have invoked a mixing length .",
    "the models derived in canuto ( 1992 , 1993 , 1997 ) and in @xcite avoid a mixing length by providing a fully non - local set of dynamic equations for the second order moments .",
    "recently , @xcite has presented the first comparison of a variant of these convection models with numerical simulations of compressible convection for a stellar - like scenario .",
    "he used the downgradient approximation ( dga ) for the third order moments . to avoid its shortcomings , here we use a more complete model .",
    "it is based on a model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the latter was successfully applied to the convective boundary layer of the terrestrial atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we describe the physical scenario for our comparison and present results for two sample problems .",
    "we also consider the potential of such models for application to envelope convection in a and f stars .",
    "in @xcite the fully compressible nse were solved for a 3d plane parallel geometry with a constant gravity @xmath4 pointing to the bottom of a simulation box .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed horizontally .",
    "a constant temperature @xmath1 was prescribed at the top and a constant input flux at the bottom of the box ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the vertical direction , i.e.  top to bottom ) .",
    "top and bottom were taken to be impenetrable and stress free .",
    "a perfect gas law was assumed and radiation was treated in the diffusion approximation .",
    "stable and unstable layers were defined through @xmath7 , which initially was a piecewise linear function in units of the adiabatic gradient : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . to define the stability properties of the layers a rayleigh number @xmath10 for one zone where",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite is specified together with a prandtl number @xmath13 and an initial temperature contrast .",
    "this yields the radiative conductivity @xmath14 .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath15 are kept fixed and place regions of stable and unstable stratification at different vertical locations in the simulation box .",
    "a similar approach was used by @xcite and others . the comparison to simulations with a prescribed viscosity",
    "avoids the need to use a subgrid scale model . according to our numerical experiments with the moment equations",
    ", molecular viscosity can decrease the efficiency of convection as measured by @xmath16 by up to 15% and smooths out the numerical solution in stably stratified regions @xcite .",
    "using the reynolds stress approach , @xcite has derived a convection model which consists of four differential equations for the basic second order moments @xmath17 ( turbulent kinetic energy ) , @xmath18 ( mean square of temperature fluctuations , i.e.  thermal potential energy ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the convective flux ) , and the vertical turbulent kinetic energy @xmath21 .",
    "the model was rederived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cd98 ) using a new turbulence model based on renormalization group techniques . in cd98 notation ,",
    "the convection model reads ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 is the volume compressibility ( @xmath31 for a perfect gas ) , @xmath32 is the superadiabatic gradient , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . the @xmath35 s",
    "are time scales .",
    "we use ( 25a ) , ( 27b ) , and ( 28b ) of cd98 to relate the latter to the dissipation time scale @xmath36 .",
    "compressibility effects are represented by @xmath37 given by equations ( 42)(48 ) of @xcite .",
    "we neglected a few terms of @xmath38 that were too small to contribute to the solution of the moment equations @xcite . in equation ( [ eq_diffeps ] ) ,",
    "@xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a constant given by ( 24d ) of cd98 , for which we take the kolmogorov constant @xmath41 , while @xmath42 is given by the low viscosity limit of ( 11f ) of cd98 .",
    "we optionally included molecular dissipation by restoring the largest ( i.e.  second order moment ) terms containing the kinematic viscosity @xmath43 ( i.e.  @xmath44 , etc . ) .",
    "they are important when @xmath13 is of order unity rather than zero @xcite .",
    "hence , we included them in all the examples shown below .",
    "for the same reason , we optionally included a term in ( [ eq_epsilon ] ) that accounts for molecular dissipation effects .",
    "we use @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 where @xmath48 while @xmath49 elsewhere ( as in cd98 ) .",
    "the local limit of ( [ eq_epsilon ] ) , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , fails to yield reasonable filling factors @xcite and was thus avoided .    to calculate the mean stratification we solve @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "equations ( [ eq_hydrostat])([eq_temp ] ) are taken from equation ( 103 ) of @xcite ( excluding the higher order term in his equation ( 104 ) ) , and from equation ( 18c ) of cd98 ( for the latter , @xmath55 was substituted to @xmath56 to account for non - boussinesq effects , canuto , priv .",
    "communication ) . in the stationary limit , ( [ eq_temp ] )",
    "yields @xmath57 where the kinetic energy flux is given by @xmath58 and the radiative flux @xmath59 .",
    "non - locality is represented by the terms @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , which require third order moments ( toms ) .",
    "using the downgradient approach ( dga ) for the toms @xcite found qualitatively acceptable results for the convective flux and filling factors . but quantitatively the results were not satisfactory , which corroborated the shortcomings of the dga found in @xcite and in @xcite . to improve over the dga , one must solve the dynamic equations for the toms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we investigated both the fully time dependent case which requires 6 additional differential equations and various approximations of their stationary limit which do not entail further differential equations . here , we consider the following `` intermediate '' model for the toms : we take the stationary limit of the dynamic equations given in @xcite , but neglect the boussinesq terms which depend on @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this model is similar in robustness to the dga , but yields significantly better results .",
    "for the boundary conditions we impose @xmath64 at the top , while at the bottom @xmath65 .",
    "this choice permits stable numerical solutions which are consistent with the boundary conditions for the numerical simulations .",
    "the equation for the mean pressure is constrained by varying @xmath3 at the top such that for a given @xmath1 the resulting density stratification is consistent with mass conservation .",
    "we have used simulation data representing two configurations : model 3j , a convection zone embedded between two strongly stable layers @xcite , and model 211p , a stably stratified layer embedded between two unstable layers ( with a small stable layer at the bottom , @xcite ) . in both cases , radiation transports at least 80% of the input energy and @xmath66 .",
    "each unstable layer has a thickness of @xmath67@xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "model 3j has an initial adiabatic temperature contrast of 3.5 and encompasses 4.2 @xmath69 while model 211p has a contrast of 6.0 and encompasses about 4.8 @xmath69 .",
    "the numerical simulations were done for @xmath70 grid points and have successfully been compared to higher resolution simulations ( @xmath71 grid points , @xcite ) .",
    "all simulation data shown here are statistical averages over many dozen sound crossing times .",
    "the moment equations were solved by centered finite differences on a staggered mesh .",
    "solutions were calculated using 72 grid points and were successfully verified by comparing them with results obtained from higher resolutions of 128 to 512 grid points .",
    "time integration was done by the euler forward method until a stationary state was reached after 1.2 to 2.5 thermal time scales .",
    "verification of stationarity was done by testing whether all errors in time derivatives were formally less than @xmath72 in relative units at all grid points ( i.e.  far smaller than the truncation error ) and by checking the strict energy flux and mass conservation required for stationary solutions .",
    "[ fig1 ] compares the convective flux of model 211p with two convection models : the non - local model with intermediate tom and its local counterpart ( the stationary , local limit of the non - local model , see cd98 ) .",
    "clearly , only the non - local model successfully reproduces the simulations also in the central overshooting region which connects both convection zones of model 211p .",
    "[ fig2 ] compares the filling factor @xmath73 , i.e.  the relative area in each layer covered by upwards flowing material , of the numerical simulations of model 3j with the filling factor computed from the non - local moment equations . for the latter we used",
    "the prescription described in cd98 .",
    "as @xmath73 is an important topological quantity describing the inhomogenous nature of convection , the reasonable agreement found here is a very promising result .",
    "it illustrates the importance of improving the toms , because the dga used in @xcite only indicated a correct trend , while the more complete tom used here also provides a closer quantitative agreement .",
    "the local convection model predicts a structureless @xmath74 .",
    "[ fig3 ] compares the convective flux from numerical simulations for model 3j with solutions from the moment equations using the intermediate tom . clearly",
    ", the latter has improved over the dga @xcite both qualitatively and quantitatively . except for the overshooting region the dga barely differed from the local model which is shown here for comparison .",
    "though the present convection model provides a substantial improvement , the convective flux still falls short in the middle of the convection zone of 3j and the extent of the lower overshooting zone is underestimated .",
    "this may be due to neglecting effects of radiative losses on the time scales @xmath75 and @xmath76 as well as because several contributions to the toms are neglected in our `` intermediate model '' , or due to the boussinesq treatment of the toms in @xcite , or incompleteness of equation ( [ eq_epsilon ] ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] compares local length scales @xmath77 as used in mixing length theory with the length scale @xmath78 obtained with the non - local moment equations for the case of model 211p .",
    "obviously , there is no @xmath30 that brings the length scales in agreement .",
    "thus , there is no alternative but to solve at least the full equations ( [ eq_epsilon])([eq_diffeps ] ) to obtain @xmath79 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have found not only qualitative , but also quantitative agreement between numerical simulations and the non - local moment equations , provided one avoids the dga for the toms and employs the stationary solution of their dynamic equations as suggested in appendix b of @xcite and neglects boussinesq type factors ( involving @xmath32 ) .",
    "moreover , we have found the mean values for t , p , and @xmath2 to be accurate to within 2% in comparison with 4% found for local models with optimized mixing length parameter .",
    "convective and radiative flux are typically accurate to within 20% .",
    "the improvements are largest in regions of weak convection and in stably stratified layers .",
    "we have used the closure constants suggested in @xcite and cd98 except for @xmath80 , which was increased from 0.2 to 0.5 , because this improved the results for the planetary boundary layer ( canuto priv .",
    "communication ) and enhanced the numerical stability .",
    "we have not found the dga to be able to yield a similar agreement for both 3j and 211p even when tuning the closure constants individually for 3j and 211p .",
    "the situation is even worse for the local model . in @xcite",
    "we will deal with this problem in detail .",
    "finally , while each 3d simulation took between several days and several weeks on a modern workstation to obtain a thermally relaxed solution , the moment equations took a couple of minutes to half an hour .",
    "this holds true already for a low numerical resolution and for an explicit time integration method .",
    "the results found here are promising for the application of the non - local convection model in particular to envelope convection zones of a and f stars , because they feature a similar range of convective efficiency , thickness in terms of @xmath81 , and interaction among neighbouring convection zones . for a and f",
    "stars the thermal structure is not known in advance .",
    "hence , thermal relaxation and thus the gain on speed in comparison with numerical simulations is essential .",
    "the computational savings are very attractive also for problems studied on hydrostatic time scales , whenever the full information provided by a simulation is not needed .",
    "improvements of the convection model studied are possible , nevertheless it is a more promising basis for asteroseismological studies of pulsating a and f stars ( @xmath82 sct , @xmath83 dor , roap , etc . ) than local convection models and also a new basis for related work such as diffusion calculations .",
    "detailed results for a broader range of physical parameters , in particular for efficient convection and deeper convection zones , and thus of high importance also for other types of stars , have yet to corroborate this study .",
