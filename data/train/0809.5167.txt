    "recently , both the singly ionized barium ( ba@xmath0 ) and ( ra@xmath0 ) are proposed as suitable candidates for the parity non - conservation ( pnc ) experiments @xcite .",

    "it is also possible to calculate the above matrix elements accurately using a highly potential many - body method .",
    "ba@xmath0 and ra@xmath0 are heavy systems implying both the electron correlation and relativistic effects will be much stronger in these systems .",
    "variety of relativistic many - body methods have already been employed to calculate the e1 matrix elements in the considered systems @xcite .",
    "but the results obtained by all these works differ at significant precision for which they can be used to determine sub - one percent accuracy of the pnc amplitudes or other experimentally measured quantities like light - shift ratios @xcite in the considered systems .    in this work ,",
    "we have employed the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method to account more electron correlation effects through the non - linear terms for the determination of many e1 matrix elements in both ba@xmath0 and ra@xmath0 .",
    "these results are then used to evaluate the light - shift ratios in ba@xmath0 at two wavelengths on which experiments were conducted @xcite . by analyzing the trends of contributions to the light - shift ratios and transition probabilities , we try to give the upper limits to some of the important matrix elements by combining with the experimental result in that system .",
    "the matrix elements are further used to determine the lifetimes and static dipole polarizabilities in ba@xmath0 . by following the same procedure ,",

    "we employ the rcc theory for the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian in the single and double excitations approximation along with the important triple excitations ( ccsd(t ) method ) to calculate the atomic wave functions in both ba@xmath0 and ra@xmath0 . in this procedure",

    "correct results up to the second decimal places are crucial in obtaining the light - shift ratios correctly as will be shown below .",
    "first , we would like to briefly discuss here the important differences in the various works presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "geetha et al .",
    "@xcite have employed the same approach like ours , but they had used part numerical orbitals using grasp and part analytical orbitals using gaussian type orbitals ( gtos ) . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered pure analytical orbitals using gtos .",
    "another difference between these two works is that @xmath104 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn10 ] ) is truncated only at the effective one - body terms by geetha et al .",
    "@xcite , where other higher order terms have been considered in the present calculation .",
    "the main difference in the methods applied by dzuba et al .",
    "@xcite and ours have been discussed by geetha et al . in their work @xcite . in summary , they have employed the green s function technique which is also an all order perturbative method like ours . in their work ,",
    "the orbitals are also obtained analytically like the present work .",
    "however , the level of approximation in both the works could be different which can not be obviously distinguished .",
    "iskrenova - tchoukova and safronova @xcite have used linearized ccsd method with important triple excitations and orbitals have been constructed using the b - spline basis . as has been pointed out earlier , the non - linear terms can incorporate higher order correlation effects which are necessary @xcite to account in the considered heavy system .",
    "again , the procedure to consider partial triple excitations in their method and in the present work is different .",
    "we consider effects of partial triple excitations by estimating each time their contributions to the energy of the corresponding valence state and then solve the ccsd method amplitudes self - consistently which involves the above energy .",
    "however , iskrenova - tchoukova and safronova include them directly in the amplitude determining equations .",
    "guet and johnson have just applied the relativistic many - body method at the second order approximation ( mbpt(2 ) method ) using the b - spline basis to calculate their results in contrast to our method which is all order in nature @xcite .",
    "we have used our calculated reduced e1 matrix elements and experimental energies @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ eqn22 ] ) to obtain the dynamic vector dipole polarizabilities ( @xmath9 ) of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 states in ba@xmath0 at two different wavelengths ( of external electric fields ) and they are presented in table [ tab2 ]",
    ". only @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 intermediate states ( @xmath16 ) have been taken into account as they seem to be the most important contributing states as seen from this table .",
    "it can be noticed that the magnitude of @xmath9s of the @xmath105 state are larger than the @xmath106 state at both the wavelengths , but their differences are smaller when the frequency of the external field is small .",
    "again , the sign of these quantities are different at the smaller wavelength ( 514.53 nm ) , whereas they are opposite at the large wavelength ( 1111.68 nm ) . for both the states ,",
    "the largest contribution comes from the @xmath107 state .",
    "the next highest contribution arises from the @xmath110 state .",
    "the third largest contributions to @xmath9 of the @xmath106 state comes from the @xmath113 state .",
    "surprisingly , the rest of the contributions are dominated by the higher f - states compared to the p - states .",
    "we have given contributions from pure core correlations , core - valence correlations and higher states those are neglected as `` others '' .",
    "the core correlation effects are around 0.319 au and 0.147 au at the wavelengths 514.53 nm and 1111.68 nm , respectively .",
    "these contributions are evaluated using the mbpt(2 ) method .",
    "the possible errors due to the omission of the higher states may come from the neglected f - states which seems to be important in the determination of @xmath9 of the @xmath106 state .",
    "therefore , an approach similar to the one applied to determine the dynamic scalar and tensor polarizabilities @xcite will be more appropriate to use for the high precision light - shift ratio studies in the present system .    now considering the above results of @xmath9 for both the @xmath105 and @xmath106 states and using eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) , we obtain the light - shift ratios in ba@xmath0 as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where core correlations contribute around 0.6% and 1% at the wavelengths 514.53 nm and 1111.68 nm , respectively .",

    "514.53 nm and 1111.68 nm , respectively @xcite .",
    "our results match well with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "it shows that accounting core correlation effects are essential for the high precision results in the light - shift studies , although their magnitudes seem to be very small in comparison to the @xmath9 of the @xmath105 state .",
    "especially , their contributions are relatively larger at the higher wavelength ( smaller frequency ) .",
    "the errors quoted in our light - shift ratio calculations are obtained from the error bars given for the e1 matrix elements in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we are now in a position to analyze the accuracy of the e1 matrix elements by studying their contributions to the light - shift ratio calculations .",
    "since contributions from the @xmath107 state seems larger , we first analyze matrix elements involving this state . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we can find that different theoretical predictions of the magnitude ( sign is irrelevant for our observable ) @xmath120 range from 3.30 au to 3.37 au ( along with the error bar ) . now keeping all other matrix elements unchanged from our calculations",
