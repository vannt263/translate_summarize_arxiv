    "mid - infrared ( mir ) emission bands related to aromatic c  h and c  c vibrational modes were found in several astrophysical environments , ranging from planetary nebula , reflection nebulosities , circumstellar disks to even active galactic nuclei ( see , e.g. , the recent review of * ? ? ?",
    "inferred from their presence , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are believed to be an important component of interstellar dust , and , after h@xmath6 and co , they are probably the most abundant molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although these mir bands do not permit an identification of specific pah molecules , general information , such as size and charge state distribution or the aliphatic - to - aromatic ratio , can be inferred @xcite .",
    "based on energetic arguments , the mir emission bands were attributed to aromatic molecules containing about ( or at least ) 50 carbon atoms @xcite . besides the elaborately investigated ir properties of pahs",
    ", it is equally important to perform experimental studies in other wavelength regimes to test whether the pah model is compatible with observations .",
    "usually , neutral or ionized pahs possess no or only weak permanent dipole moments .",
    "therefore , strong spectroscopic fingerprints due to pure rotational transitions in the radio range are not expected . on the other hand , electronic @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 transitions give rise to distinct absorption bands in the uv - vis .",
    "the ism displays two clear spectroscopic features in this wavelength range : a growing number of yet unidentified diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) above 400 nm and a broad bump at 217.5 nm with almost fixed position , but varying strength and width for different lines of sight .",
    "these features are superimposed on a background with increasing extinction at shorter wavelengths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "below 400 nm , the extinction curve is smooth and no narrow bands that can be related to polyatomic gas phase molecules were found @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , electronic spectra of astrophysically relevant _ large _ pahs and mixtures of them measured in the laboratory under appropriate conditions are almost unavailable , mainly because sufficient quantities of suitable samples are difficult to obtain . @xcite and @xcite studied the uv - vis absorption properties of a few selected matrix - isolated pahs consisting of max .",
    "48 c atoms .",
    "these studies were guided by the search for possible dib carriers and were biased toward more exotic or elongated structures because of their strong absorption bands in the vis . by measuring the absorbance of mixtures of hot gaseous pahs with mean sizes around 31 c atoms",
    ", @xcite found that the strongest spectral feature is a broad bump at 210 nm , very close and similar in shape to the interstellar extinction bump at 217.5 nm .",
    "recently , we obtained analogous results for mixtures of comparably dimensioned pahs which were isolated in solid ne at low temperature @xcite .",
    "a strong uv bump was found around 200 nm accompanied by a rather featureless extinction curve if molecules with less than 22 c atoms were absent from the mixture .",
    "considering semi - empirical calculations , we argued that the bump position may shift to the red , eventually reaching 217.5 nm , for species large enough to be associated with the mir emission bands ( @xmath7 50 c atoms ) .",
    "this idea is furthermore supported by calculations applying time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) .",
    "@xcite showed that a pah mixture , comprising a limited number of different structures , could also give rise to a bump around 217.5 nm .",
    "while more than 400 dibs are known today , none of their carriers which are thought to be large carbon - bearing molecules in the gas phase , such as pahs and their ions , have been identified yet ( for a review on dibs see * ? ? ?",
    "an unambiguous identification requires the comparison with experimental spectra of the species under consideration .",
    "usually , this demands for the application of elaborate experimental techniques , like cavity ring down spectroscopy carried out at low temperature in the gas phase .",
    "so far , the spectra of only a few small pahs consisting of less than 25 c atoms have been recorded with this method ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when in their neutral charge state , such small molecules display their strongest absorption bands in the uv .",
    "as already mentioned , no sharp absorption bands were found in the uv part of the interstellar extinction curve implying a very small abundance of small neutral pahs @xcite .",
    "the cations , on the other hand , show additional strong bands in the vis wavelength range .",
    "however , these bands are usually too broad compared to the widths of most dibs .",
    "recent attempts to search for bands of the naphthalene ( c@xmath8h@xmath9 ) and anthracene ( c@xmath1h@xmath8 ) cations in interstellar spectra were proven to be unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "this article presents new experimental results on the uv - vis absorption properties of medium - sized to large pahs .",
    "supported by theoretical calculations , we attempt to solidify the connection between large pahs and the uv bump .",
    "bearing in mind that , for different lines of sight , the molecular population is affected by different physical conditions , like the strength of the uv field , it is important to address the question whether ionization has an effect on the bump position of pah mixtures .",
    "we approach this issue experimentally through photoionization of two matrix - isolated pahs , dibenzorubicene c@xmath0h@xmath1 ( dbr ) and hexabenzocoronene c@xmath2h@xmath3 ( hbc ) , which display strong absorption bands around 217.5 nm in their neutral state . for the first time , complete electronic spectra of pah ions spanning the full uv - vis range down to 200 nm will be presented .",
    "the spectrum of the hbc cation will be of particular interest as , in addition to its superior stability @xcite , this molecule has a size comparable to the pah size that was inferred from the aromatic ir emission bands .",
    "in this section , we shortly address the problem of the uv signature of pahs ( the bump below 230 nm ) and its size dependence using computational methods .",
    "previously , we already calculated the absorbance of artificial pah mixtures with different mean sizes by applying a semi - empirical method @xcite .",
    "the low computational costs of this method , however , may be accompanied by rather unprecise band positions and strengths .",
    "furthermore , size - dependent effects could partially be related to the model itself .",
    "this can be avoided by using more elaborate ab initio and td - dft methods which , on the other hand , can only be applied to a limited number of molecules .",
    "@xcite calculated the absorption spectra of 40 pahs in different charge states using a special treatment of td - dft implemented in the octopus software package @xcite .",
    "these spectra were later collected in an online database and used by @xcite to simulate artificial extinction curves for a dust model that includes pahs . in this model , the uv bump and the non - linear far - uv ( fuv ) rise of the interstellar extinction curve",
    "were solely attributed to electronic transitions in pahs . here",
    ", we used the td - dft implementation of the gaussian09 software @xcite which relies on basis sets to create the molecular orbitals .",
    "the computational effort of this method scales steeply with the number of electronic transitions to be calculated and , therefore , it is much more expensive compared to the octopus implementation when the spectrum has to be obtained over a large energy range . at present",
    ", it is the most accurate method to calculate electronic spectra of large pahs down to wavelengths of ca .",
    "200 nm , i.e. , for energies smaller than 6.2 ev ( 5 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) .",
    "we focused on seven selected pahs with compact structures , possibly representing the average pah population of the ism .",
    "as indicated by astronomical observations in the mid - ir , interstellar pahs are rather compact than elongated @xcite . the b3lyp functional @xcite in conjunction with the 6 - 31+g(d ) basis set was used to optimize the ground state geometries and to calculate the vertical electronic transition energies afterward .",
    "additional vibrational excitations can not be treated in this approach . however , at higher energies , a substantial band broadening is expected , resulting in spectra without discernible vibrational pattern even for cold matrix - isolated or gas phase molecules ( see , e.g. , section [ results ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the calculated electronic absorption spectra of compact pahs belonging to the d@xmath12 ( top panel ) and d@xmath13 ( bottom panel ) point groups .",
    "it should be taken into account that the uncertainty for the band positions at this level of theory can typically reach up to 0.3 ev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the moment , we limit the discussion to neutral species , as the ions demand higher computational efforts due to their open - shell structure . for each series ( d@xmath13 and d@xmath12 ) , the same symmetry - related selection rules apply , allowing direct comparison among the differently sized species . the theoretical stick spectra ( oscillator strength vs. energy , not shown ) have been convoluted with lorentzian functions with full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 3000 cm@xmath11 to obtain the spectra shown by solid lines .",
    "similar absorption spectra can be expected for weakly bonded pah clusters where vibrational patterns are smoothed out due to the van der waals interactions among the molecules . to illustrate this point ,",
    "the absorption spectra of thin films of coronene and hbc are shown for comparison ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "for the spectra represented by dashed lines , the fwhm for each transition was chosen to be proportional to the number of energetically lower - lying transitions while keeping the area of each band proportional to the corresponding oscillator strength .",
    "the purpose of this convolution is to reflect the increased lifetime broadening at higher energies and to visually enhance the weaker bands at longer wavelengths .",
    "this also resembles more closely the situation of matrix - isolated molecules as will be seen in section [ results ] .",
    "however , one should consider that the band intensity ( integrated cross section ) of real molecules in the visible is usually distributed over several vibrational bands reducing the peak intensities .    looking at both pah series , a strong uv peak around 217.5 nm for molecules with more than @xmath15 32 c atoms ( ovalene ) is apparent which is in agreement with the results of @xcite who showed that the cations and anions also display this uv peak ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . from the computational point of view",
    ", the transitions of large pahs that produce the uv bands around 217.5 nm are almost not affected when one electron is removed from the highest occupied orbital or added to the lowest unoccupied orbital .",
    "differences in the uv spectra of different charge states should mainly concern the bandwidths .",
    "this problem can not be assessed with theoretical calculations and will be addressed in section [ results ] . while the feature around 217.5 nm seems to be a common property among different sufficiently large pahs , bands at longer wavelengths depend more strongly on the specific molecular structure .",
    "the averaging over several pah molecules will produce a rather smooth extinction curve with a broad uv bump , possibly around 217.5 nm , as main feature .",
    "even though the species we chose for the calculations are not large enough ( due to computational limitations ) , a shift of their uv bump to even longer wavelengths , i.e. , beyond 220 nm , can be expected for increasing molecular sizes .",
    "it is known that also amorphous graphitic material and nanoparticles , usually containing both aromatic and aliphatic components , can feature a similar uv bump in the wavelength range between 220 and 260 nm @xcite .",
    "the varying band position might , at least partly , be related to the average size of the aromatic planes .",
    "however , the width of the bump in these nanoscopic and macroscopic materials is often quite broad due to several possible effects , such as particle agglomeration , van der waals and covalent bonding between the aromatic planes , or just broad size distributions of the aromatic planes .",
    "in the wavelength range below 200 nm , the spectra of large pahs share further characteristics .",
    "these characteristics can only be obtained by theory , as almost no experimental data are available . for the calculation of the fuv absorption bands of pahs , the method described in the previous section",
    "is computationally too expensive due to the high density of states in this energy regime .",
    "the determination of electronic transitions should now be based on the td - dft implementation of the octopus software package @xcite .",
    "compared to the calculations by @xcite , we chose slightly different parameters .",
    "the octopus code relies on numerical meshes instead of basis sets to calculate the wave functions in real - space and real - time .",
    "followed by an initial very short electromagnetic pulse , exciting all frequencies of the system , the time - dependent dipole moment is calculated from which the linear optical absorption spectrum , comprising all possible electronic bound - bound transitions , can be derived .",
    "the crucial parameters of the calculation are the functional ( here b3lyp ) , the volume of the numerical box ( sphere around each atom with radius 3  ) , the grid spacing ( 0.25  ) , the time integration length ( 20 @xmath16/ev ) , and the time step ( 0.002 @xmath16/ev ) .    here , we only want to emphasize the most important and securest information that can be extracted from these calculations and that concerns the compatibility of the fuv absorption properties of large pahs with the interstellar extinction .",
    "a more extensive discussion can be found in the publication by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", different fuv rises that are observed for the interstellar extinction in different lines of sight were interpreted to stem from different ionization states in the same pah population .",
    "the calculated pah spectra showed a tendency for a reduction of the absorption cross section in the gap between the highest - energy @xmath4  @xmath5 transitions and the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 fuv rise when going from anions over neutral molecules to cations .",
    "however , this effect seems to be more pronounced in smaller pahs and the majority of the 40 different molecules in this model contained less than 32 c atoms .",
    "also , no physical explanation was given for this behavior .",
    "using the octopus code , we calculated the spectra of neutral , cationic , and anionic hbc which are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the spectra are very similar to the ones obtained by @xcite who used the lda ( local - density approximation ) functional .",
    "the widths of the absorption bands are purely artificial and depend solely on the integration length used in the calculation .",
    "the area of each band , however , is directly related to the oscillator strength of the corresponding transition(s ) .",
    "the shown spectra of hbc below 8 @xmath10m@xmath11 are dominated by @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 transitions .",
    "the calculated energies of their band positions , however , are somewhat too low as becomes obvious upon comparison with the measured spectrum of a film - like hbc deposit . also , the calculated strength of the transition at 2.3 @xmath10m@xmath11 is underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "note that the broad bands of the hbc film will become much narrower if the molecules are isolated from each other in the gas phase or in a low - temperature matrix . by comparing with experimental gas phase spectra of anthracene",
    ", it was shown that the general trend of the broad @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 hump above 8 @xmath10m@xmath11 as calculated with the octopus code is in good agreement with measurements @xcite . in the energy range above 2 @xmath10m@xmath11 , the calculated spectra of differently",
    "charged hbc molecules are principally very similar to each other as this range is dominated by transitions where electrons are promoted from occupied to unoccupied molecular orbitals , i.e. , electrons overleap the band gap ( b- and c - type transitions ) .",
    "further to the red ( @xmath19 2 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) , additional transitions to the semi - occupied orbital of the cation ( a - type transitions ) , as well as combined transitions to and from the semi - occupied orbital of the anion , give rise to additional bands which are absent for the neutral molecule .",
    "for the interstellar extinction , no correlation could be observed between the bump at 217.5 nm and the non - linear fuv rise at shorter wavelengths @xcite . in order to ascribe the uv bump to a pah feature",
    ", the fuv absorption properties of pahs have to be compatible with the observed fuv rise of interstellar dust which is weakest for lines of sight with strong reddening ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . as is apparent from the calculated hbc spectra , the onset of the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 hump is at rather high energies ( 8 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) .",
    "the absorption gap between the strongest @xmath4  @xmath5 resonance and the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 absorption onset fits quite well to the observed fuv extinction properties of the interstellar dust .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical spectra illustrate that the effect which was described by @xcite , i.e. , the differently pronounced gap for different charge states , does not necessarily have to be true for larger species .",
    "certainly , alternative scenarios that could explain the observed variations of the strength of the non - linear fuv rise , such as changes in the composition of other dust components , especially aliphatic components in carbonaceous grains , have to be explored .",
    "this section addresses the question how photoionization influences the uv absorption bands of large pahs , especially the bump around 217.5 nm . according to the calculations presented before and the theoretical studies by @xcite the energies and strengths of the short - wavelength b- and c - type transitions of large neutral pahs ( @xmath20 450 nm in the case of hbc ) are almost unaffected upon removal or attachment of one electron .",
    "potential differences , e.g. , concerning the band shapes and positions , however , are only accessible via laboratory measurements . for this purpose , we used matrix isolation spectroscopy ( mis ) to measure the wavelength - dependent photoabsorption between 190 and 850 nm of hbc and dbr molecules isolated in solid ne at 7 k. the number of ne atoms relative to the number of molecules to be investigated ( isolation ratio ) was on the order of @xmath21 for dbr and @xmath22 for hbc , respectively .",
    "after preparation of the matrix doped with the neutral pah molecules , the sample was exposed to the fuv radiation ( 10.2  11.8 ev ) of a hydrogen - flow discharge lamp @xcite to create ions from the neutral parent molecules . during the irradiation of typically 15 min , the fuv intensity on the sample surface was roughly @xmath23 ",
    "@xmath24 photons m@xmath25 s@xmath11 .",
    "the applied low fuv doses , as well as the inability of the molecules to diffuse through the matrix exclude the possibility that more complex chemical alterations than simple one - photon induced reactions ( here only ionization ) take place . the setup for mis and fuv processing",
    "is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "parts of the spectrum of ionized hbc in ar matrix , which have been chosen for presentation because of a better signal - to - noise ratio , were recorded with a different setup @xcite . due to the close proximity of the molecules in the matrix , recombination reactions between already ionized molecules and released",
    "electrons limit the maximum ion yield to values somewhere below 20% after a certain fuv dose is reached . to disentangle the absorption bands of ionic and neutral species which , especially in the uv range , overlap each other , the following procedure was performed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] ) . the transmission spectrum measured",
    "after irradiation was first baseline - corrected against the spectrum before irradiation , i.e. , the spectrum of the neutral molecules .",
    "the spectrum thus derived in units of absorbance ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] ) displays positive features from species created during the irradiation ( ions ) and negative features from species that were destroyed ( neutrals ) .",
    "then , the contributions of the destroyed neutral molecules were simply subtracted by using an accurate fit obtained from the complete spectrum before irradiation .",
    "after subtraction , the spectrum contains only bands from species that were created during the irradiation .",
    "actually , this procedure works quite well in the uv range despite the strong overlap of bands of the neutral and ionized molecules . for instance , even the sharp lines at 308 nm ( 3.25 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) and 283 nm ( 3.53 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) from the oh radical ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] ) which was created by photodissociation of trace amounts of water are properly reproduced .",
    "problems can only occur in spectral ranges where the spectrum of the neutral precursor contains sharp bands that are represented by only one or two data points .",
    "for dbr , this is the case only at 540 nm ( 1.85 @xmath10m@xmath11 ) .",
    "the electrons released from the neutral parent molecules are usually trapped at defects and impurities in the matrix .",
    "therefore , cations are generally created in excess compared to anions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between cation and anion number densities depends on several parameters , such as the purity and crystallinity of the matrix , the isolation ratio , or the electron affinities of the molecules and impurities .",
    "the possible contribution of anions to our spectra will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "the measured spectra of neutral and ionized matrix - isolated dbr are displayed in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "detailed information on the spectroscopy , both in absorption and emission , of neutral dbr is given in another paper @xcite .",
    "dbr can be regarded as a planar fragment of the fullerene c@xmath26 ( with h - saturated dangling bonds ) , which was recently discovered in the planetary nebula tc 1 @xcite .",
    "the neutral molecule has several strong absorption peaks in the uv , one specific at 212 nm in close proximity of the 217.5 nm interstellar bump .",
    "therefore , it is an ideal test molecule to investigate how the high - energy @xmath4  @xmath5 transitions are affected by ionization .",
    "the theoretical spectra of neutral , cationic , and anionic dbr are presented in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "they were obtained in the same manner as the dashed spectra of figure [ fig1 ] , i.e. , using the td - dft approach of the gaussian09 program , applying the 6 - 311++g(2d , p ) basis set , and performing a convolution with lorentzians , where the widths were proportional to the number of energetically lower - lying states .",
    "the optimized ground state geometry of dbr in all three charge states was found to be c@xmath27 .",
    "the electronic ground state symmetries are @xmath28a@xmath29 ( neutral ) , @xmath30b@xmath29 ( cation ) , and @xmath30a@xmath31 ( anion ) . for the neutral and the cation , electronic transitions from the ground state to excited states of a@xmath31 and b@xmath31",
    "symmetry are dipole - allowed . for wavelengths shorter than 500 nm , the electronic excitation schemes of the various transitions are very similar for the neutral and the cation",
    ". computational differences mainly arise from the broader cation bands which are caused by the convolution procedure and the fact that the cation has several low - energy transitions unlike the neutral molecule . above 500",
    "nm the theoretical spectrum of the dbr cation is dominated by weak transitions where electrons are promoted to the semi - occupied orbital , e.g. , d@xmath32(b@xmath31)@xmath33d@xmath34(b@xmath29 ) at 673 nm , d@xmath35(b@xmath31)@xmath33d@xmath34(b@xmath29 ) at 613 nm , d@xmath36(b@xmath31)@xmath33d@xmath34(b@xmath29 ) at 567 nm , and d@xmath8(b@xmath31)@xmath33d@xmath34(b@xmath29 ) at 540 nm .",
    "two further dipole - allowed ( b@xmath31 ) and two dipole - forbidden ( a@xmath29 ) transitions are predicted beyond 900 nm , outside of the accessible scanning range .",
    "the symmetry - related selection rules that apply to the anion are somewhat different .",
    "due to its _ ungerade _ ground state , dipole - allowed transitions are only possible to a@xmath29 and b@xmath29 states .",
    "therefore , its calculated spectrum deviates more strongly from the spectra of the other two species . in view of the experimental spectrum of ionized dbr and the lack of strong absorption bands beyond 600 nm ,",
    "we conclude that much less anions were formed than cations and we ascribe the measured spectrum solely to the dbr cation .    except for a sometimes wrong ordering of states",
    ", it can be seen that the applied td - dft method works fairly well in the case of the neutral molecule .",
    "the s@xmath37(b@xmath31)@xmath33s@xmath34(a@xmath29 ) transition , for instance , is predicted at 536 nm , while the origin band is actually measured at 540 nm .",
    "two close - lying bands , s@xmath38(b@xmath31)@xmath33s@xmath34(a@xmath29 ) and s@xmath39(b@xmath31)@xmath33s@xmath34(a@xmath29 ) , are calculated to be at 448 and 427 nm .",

    "@xmath43 structure of the neutral precursor which essentially can be explained by similar excitation schemes of electronic c - type transitions for both molecules .",
    "because of a stronger broadening for all uv bands , the bump peaking at 215 nm appears even more pronounced for the cation compared to the neutral .",
    "the spectroscopy of matrix - isolated neutral hbc is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "because of its all - benzenoid structure , it is believed that hbc is more abundant in space compared to other similarly - sized pahs @xcite .",
    "the calculated spectrum of neutral hbc , obtained at the b3lyp / 6 - 31+g(d ) level of theory , reveals a good match with the mis measurements ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , both in terms of relative band strengths and positions .",
    "neutral hbc has a d@xmath44 ground state geometry .",
    "the intensity of its s@xmath39(e@xmath45)@xmath33s@xmath34(a@xmath46 ) transition , calculated to be at 364 nm , is actually distributed over a complicated vibrational pattern that involves a@xmath46 modes of vibration and vibrational excitations belonging to an energetically lower b@xmath45 state , to which electronic transitions from the ground state are dipole - forbidden .",
    "also the weak s@xmath37(b@xmath47)@xmath33s@xmath34(a@xmath46 ) transition , for which a peak of an undefined vibrationally excited state has been measured at 434 nm , borrows some intensity from the s@xmath48(e@xmath45 ) state .",

    "this also complicates the assignment of measured absorption bands on the basis of dft calculations as these methods can already fail to correctly predict the distorted geometry of a degenerate ground state ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the comparison of the measured spectrum of ionized hbc with the td - dft calculated spectra ( bottom panel in figure [ fig4 ] ) does not permit to exclude the presence of anion bands , in contrast to the case for dbr .",
    "the band system with observed origin around 830 nm in the ne matrix could have its theoretical counterpart in either cation or anion bands predicted around 740 nm . using the real - time , real - space implementation of td - dft ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) ,",

    "if the strong band broadening could be ascribed to a matrix - induced effect , larger bandwidths for the ar compared to the ne environment would be expected , as interaction - related effects are usually more pronounced for atoms with higher polarizabilities .",
    "the shapes and widths of these features , however , do not seem to depend on the rare gas atoms surrounding the molecule ( for @xmath20 550 nm ) , indicating an intrinsic effect , e.g. , very short lifetimes of the excited electronic states . on that supposition , low - temperature gas phase spectra of ionized medium - sized to large pahs , such as dbr and hbc , at wavelengths shorter than approximately 400",

    "we will take a closer look at this in the following subsection .",
    "a connection between large pahs and the dibs is often assumed .",

    "while the case of the neutral molecule is discussed in another article @xcite , cationic dbr does not exhibit sufficiently narrow bands - at least for wavelengths shorter than 900 nm .",

    "a comparable band shape has been found at 462 nm in ar matrix for the smaller coronene cation @xcite , which has an electronic structure similar to the hbc cation .",
    "the comparison of the band positions that were extrapolated for the gas phase with the synthetic dib spectrum of @xcite demonstrates that ionized hbc can safely be excluded as a potential dib carrier .",
    "basically , the obtained gas phase positions and @xmath67-values could be used to search for interstellar features of hbc cations , but we are skeptical whether such an endeavor would be successful .",
    "a search for interstellar hbc in its neutral charge state was already unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "we want to stress again that because of its size and superior stability ( most stable pah with 42 c atoms ) one would expect to observe features of neutral or charged hbc on the interstellar extinction curve if the pah hypothesis , i.e. , the assignment of the dibs to large pahs , would be correct .",
    "however , in view of the expected chemical variety for pahs of this size and the failure to detect hbc in interstellar spectra it seems unlikely that a few selected pah molecules ( out of several million possible structures ) could be abundant enough to be responsible for one or more of the roughly 400 dibs .",
    "additionally , pah spectra can be very complex with complicated vibrational and intermediate level structures which do not seem to be present in interstellar spectra .",

    "furthermore , electronic bands of cations appearing in the vis can be very broad ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) making it impossible to connect them with the narrower dibs . in summary , we would expect that the population of large interstellar pahs produces a smooth extinction curve as it was already observed for mixtures of sufficiently large pahs in inert gas matrices @xcite .",
