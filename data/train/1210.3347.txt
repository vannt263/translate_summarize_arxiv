    "if we assume the maximum bolometric correction estimated above as an upper limit and a plateau phase at @xmath61 for @xmath62  days , we constrain the total radiated energy during this period to be @xmath63  erg . however , we should note that the brightening could have started earlier than jul .  24 , in which case this could be a lower limit in the total radiated energy during this phase",

    "as shown in figure  3 , the transition in spectroscopic properties is coincident with the very rapid brightening observed in the optical light curves .",
    "this , most likely , marks the start of a strong interaction between the fast sn shock and a dense csm environment likely formed from material ejected in the previous lbv outbursts , as proposed by m12b .",
    "the timing of the rapid optical brightening is also coincident with the detection of x - ray emission from sn  2009ip ( campana & margutti 2012 ) , which is consistent with this picture . another possible signature of a strong ejecta - csm interaction is the decline of @xmath67  mag observed right before the spectral changes were seen and the light curve started to rise rapidly .",
    "moriya & maeda ( 2012 ) propose that this is an unavoidable consequence of a fast sn shock breaking out of a dense csm .",

    "2012 ) .",
    "the very early rapid optical brightening of the type  iin sn  2009ip is consistent with @xmath68 during a short 2-day phase , although this naturally depends on the @xmath69 used .",
    "this is the evolution expected for an homologously expanding ( optically thick ) black - body photosphere at constant expansion velocity and effective temperature .",
    "the luminous type  iin sn  2003ma and sn  2006gy show relatively similar evolution in their optical luminosity at early times before peak .",
    "in fact , smith & mccray ( 2007 ) modeled the early rise of sn  2006gy with c model .",
    "sn  2011ht rises at a slower rate in the optical , although it was observed to rise much faster in the uv - range ( roming et al .",
    "2012 ) . given the simplified assumptions that go into the @xmath70 scaling , we plan to explore more realistic models ( e.g. , moriya et al .",
    "2012 ) to fit the early time light curve of sn  2009ip in a future publication .    at later times , close to peak brightness ,",
    "the optical luminosity and light curve shape of sn  2009ip becomes more similar to sn  2011ht than sn  2003ma or sn  2006gy .",
    "mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2012a ) proposed that sn  2011ht belongs to a growing sub - class of type  iin sne ( type  iin - p ; including also sn  2009kn , kankare et al .",
    "2012 , and sn  1994w , sollerman et al . 1998 ) with long - lasting post - peak plateaus of @xmath57  days ( @xmath71  mag ) , and faint late - time decay slopes consistent with low @xmath72ni yield production ( @xmath73  m@xmath7 ) .",
    "perhaps we are seeing something similar in the case of sn  2009ip ( but see p12 ) , although there are important differences in spectroscopic properties compared to the small group of type  iin - p sne ( e.g. , sn  2009ip shows significantly hotter continuum and the narrow lines do not show p - cygni profiles ) .",
    "an interesting related issue that comes out from the recent observations of sn  2009ip before the rapid brightening and fast transition to narrow - line dominated spectrum , is whether surveys might be missing a relatively low - luminosity phase ( at least compared to the main peak ) in which the broad sn shock velocities are revealed . given the typical depth of transient surveys , this is certainly possible ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "17 in kiewe et al .",
    "in fact , smith et al .",
    "( 2011b ) proposed such an origin for the @xmath57  day plateau at @xmath74  mag observed before the main peak in the light curve of sn  1961v .",

    "9 with @xmath75-@xmath76 meter aperture telescopes from the coral towers observatory ( cairns , australia ) .",
    "using difference imaging analysis , we obtain precise @xmath17 and @xmath23-band light curves and are able to resolve well - defined brightening phases .",

    "the sn brightened between absolute magnitude @xmath77 and @xmath78 in 16  days .",
    "the changes that we observe in the light curves are correlated with the reported spectroscopic changes and the x - ray detection , and , most likely , mark the start of a strong interaction between the fast sn ejecta and the dense csm formed from material that was ejected in the pre - supernova lbv eruptions observed since 2009 .",
