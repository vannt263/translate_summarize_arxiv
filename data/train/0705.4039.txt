    "the nature of the ground state of two - dimensional carbon ( i. e.  graphene \" ) in a uniform magnetic field is an issue which has attracted a lot of attention lately .",
    "the interest mainly stems from the recent experimental observation @xcite of the additional plateaus in the hall conductivity at the values of zero and unity which are not naturally explained by the picture of non - interacting electrons alone @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind the formation of the gaps in the energy spectrum that apparently develop within the zeroth landau level has been a matter of debate .",
    "on one hand , the coulomb repulsion may on general grounds be expected to favor breaking of the sublattice @xcite , or ",
    "valley \" symmetry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which in the zeroth landau level are equivalent .",
    "if the zeeman coupling of the electron spin to the magnetic field is entirely neglected the sense of this symmetry breaking can be equal or opposite for the two projections of spin , depending on details of the interaction on the lattice scale .",
    "this would yield a staggered pattern of either charge or spin in the ground state , with the concomitant many - body gap in the quasiparticle spectrum @xcite .",
    "one could , however , also imagine the opposite limit of a strong coupling of the electron spin to the magnetic field , in which the gap in the spectrum at half filling would become essentially a single - particle zeeman gap .",
    "of course , such a ferromagnetic ground state is already favored by the repulsive coulomb interaction alone , due to the familiar physics of hund s rule @xcite .",
    "the interplay between different possible instabilities in graphene in magnetic field represents an important unsolved problem at the moment @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "i would like to point out and explore a surprising symmetry between different order parameters which may help its resolution .",
    "[ flowfig ]    i consider the minimal hubbard model for the interacting electrons living on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "although admittedly a simplification , the hubbard model already contains most of the relevant physics . without a magnetic field it exhibits both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states in its phase diagram @xcite , with the latter as stable at half filling @xcite . in a field , constraining the nel vector to lie parallel to it leads to a discontinuous transition between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states at a critical zeeman coupling , as discussed in the previous work by the author @xcite . here",
    "i calculate the ground state energy in the hartree - fock approximation , but for an _ arbitrary _ direction of the nel vector .",
    "an immediate , and maybe not entirely unexpected result is that the ground state energy at half filling is minimized when the nel order parameter @xmath4 is in fact _ orthogonal _ to the external magnetic field .",
    "restricting therefore @xmath4 to its easy plane @xmath5 and taking the magnetization @xmath6 to be parallel to the external magnetic field @xmath7 , the ground state energy at half filling becomes nearly symmetric with respect to an internal @xmath8 group of rotations of the three - dimensional order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this symmetry becomes exact in the zeroth landau level approximation , if the zeeman effect and the discreteness of the lattice are also neglected . with these realistic symmetry",
    "breaking effects included one finds that with the increase of zeeman coupling the system at half filling suffers a continuous quantum phase transition from the  mixed \" state with both @xmath10 and @xmath11 to a pure ferromagnet with @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . with a change in the chemical potential",
    "the third nel component @xmath13 eventually becomes finite and produces additional incompressible states at the filling factors @xmath1 .",
    "an observation of such , albeit according to our estimate , a rather weak nel order along the magnetic field at @xmath1 would provide a direct support for our theory .    motivated by a recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "i examine the dependence of the activation gap at filling @xmath1 on the in - plane component of the magnetic field , at the fixed perpendicular field .",
    "the present theory predicts such a gap to be completely independent of the in - plane component only if at the filling zero @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in which case it is simply given by @xmath16 .",
    "given that this seems to be the situation in the experiment , we conclude that for the experimentally relevant values of the parameters the ground state should have a finite @xmath13 at the filling factor @xmath1 , whereas it should be a pure ferromagnet at zero filling .",
    "this conclusion is in accord with the observed dissipative nature of the state at the filling zero , which can be understood in terms of the particular edge - state transport implied by such a ferromagnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "it is then also in agreement with one of the possible scenarios discussed previously in ref .",
    "( 9 ) , where the nel order parameter was constrained to lie only along the magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "i derive the expression for the ground - state energy of the system as a function of nel and uniform magnetizations , in the hartree - fock approximation . in the section",
    "iii the emergence and the breaking of the approximate so(3 ) symmetry by different terms in the hamiltonian is discussed .",
    "the discussion of the result as they pertain to experiment is given in the section v. finally , the main results are summarized in section vi .",
    "let me define the hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sites @xmath20 denote one triangular sublattice of the honeycomb lattice , generated by linear combinations of the basis vectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the second sublattice is then at @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the particle number and the magnetization vector at site @xmath20 .",
    "variables at the second sublattice are analogously defined in terms of fermion operators @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath29 is just the standard hubbard on - site repulsion , written here in the rotationally invariant form which will prove to be suitable for our purposes .",
    "here we are after the hartree - fock ground state of the hubbard model in the uniform magnetic field and at half filling . even at the highest laboratory fields @xmath30 the magnetic length is much larger than the lattice spacing , @xmath31 .",
    "it suffices therefore to consider only the continuum theory corresponding to the hubbard model .",
    "general form of the low - energy field theory of graphene has been discussed in detail before @xcite . for present purposes",
    "it will be enough to consider the hartree - fock ground state obtained after the usual decoupling of the interaction term in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic channels .",
    "we thus assume a uniform density ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , and allow for both the uniform ( @xmath34 ) and staggered magnetizations ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "standard manipulations @xcite give the ground state energy per unit area and at half - filling to be @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the ground state energy per unit area of the resulting single - particle hamiltonian @xmath38 @xmath39 represents the zeeman effect of the uniform magnetic field @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the electron g - factor .",
    "@xmath42 , with @xmath43 , is the standard dirac hamiltonian near the two fermi points in the spectrum of @xmath44 @xcite , @xcite . for simplicity , the magnetic field will be assumed to be orthogonal to the graphene plane , until further notice .",
    "we work in  graphene representation \" of the clifford algebra @xcite in which @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the standard pauli basis of two - dimensional matrices .",
    "likewise , @xmath49 represents the four - dimensional unit matrix . in our units",
    "the coupling constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 are both proportional to the original repulsion energy @xmath53 , and positive .",
    "although they are exactly equal at the lattice scale , as evident from the form of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , they in general will not be in the _ effective _ linearized dirac theory sensible only below a certain momentum cutoff @xmath54 .",
    "subscribing to the usual logic of the low - energy description , @xmath51 and @xmath52 must be considered only as effective parameters which themselves depend on the cutoff @xmath54 in a way that ensures the cutoff independence of all physical quantities .",
    "this observation will play a role in the selection of the ground state , as will be discussed shortly .    to proceed one",
    "needs the spectrum of the eight - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath55 .",
    "perhaps this is most easily computed by casting it into a block - diagonal form @xmath56 @xcite , with @xmath57 here we have chosen the third spin axis and the magnetization to be along the magnetic field , i. e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "next we note that @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "it is sufficient therefore to find the spectrum of the single four - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "after some algebra the eigenvalues of @xmath55 are this way found at @xmath69 with @xmath70 ^ 2 \\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the degeneracies per unit area of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "note that for @xmath77 the eigenvalues become the familiar relativistic landau levels split by the zeeman term , as expected .",
    "for @xmath78 , on the other hand , the spectrum reduces to the landau levels of the massive dirac hamiltonian , with the mass @xmath79 , also in agreement with the previous calculations @xcite .    at half filling then the ground state of @xmath55",
    "has all the eigenstates with negative energies filled , and all the others empty , so @xmath80= -\\frac{1}{2\\pi l^2 } \\sum_{\\sigma=\\pm 1 } [    e_{0 \\sigma }    +   2   \\sum_{n\\neq 0 }   e_{n\\sigma }   ] .\\ ] ] the variational hartree - fock ground - state energy is then determined by the least value of the expression in eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "let us minimize the hartree - fock ground state energy given by eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 8) , assuming @xmath81 . choosing @xmath79 and @xmath13 as independent variables and then differentiating with respect to @xmath13 yields @xmath82=0.\\ ] ] the left - hand side of the equation vanishes for @xmath83 , and otherwise is a negative definite function of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath84 is therefore the only solution .",
    "one can also show that this solution represents the _ minimum _ of the energy . restricting the nel vector then to be orthogonal to the magnetic field the ground state energy in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be rewritten as , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 @xmath89 , \\ ] ] @xmath90 ^2 \\ } ^{1/2 } } { \\pi l^2}.\\ ] ] this form makes it manifest that the hartree - fock ground state energy at half filling is nearly symmetric with respect to rotations of the three - component order parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the identification of this approximate internal @xmath8 symmetry is our central result .",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry is in the hubbard model broken by three terms of different physical origin : 1 ) the difference between the coupling constants @xmath52 and @xmath92 at the cutoff @xmath54 ( @xmath93 ) , 2 ) the finite zeeman coupling to the magnetic field @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , and 3 ) the @xmath96 landau level contribution ( @xmath97 ) . if one were to consider only the zeroth landau level , use the bare values of the couplings for which @xmath98 , and neglect the zeeman coupling , the hartree - fock ground - state energy would become perfectly @xmath8 symmetric . in particular , the antiferromagnetic state with the nel vector orthogonal to the external magnetic field and the ferromagnetic state with the magnetization along the same field would in this approximation appear as degenerate .",
    "clearly , the zeeman term favors magnetization .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that @xmath99 prefers the nel components @xcite .",
    "it is less obvious what the sign of the  easy - axis anisotropy \" , i. e. of @xmath100 , in @xmath93 should be .",
    "this is determined by the flow of the two coupling constants as the high - energy modes between the momenta @xmath101 and @xmath102 are integrated out essentially at zero magnetic field .",
    "since the leading instability of the hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice and at half filling as the interaction strength is increased is towards the antiferromagnetism , we may assume that in general @xmath103 in the low energy theory .",
    "this would also be in accord with the explicit renormalization group calculation for weak couplings @xcite .",
    "the ground state in the hartree - fock approximation is thus the result of the competition between the high - energy modes represented by @xmath104 and @xmath99 , and the zeeman coupling , which favor antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic solutions , respectively .",
    "since the effect of @xmath99 is in the same direction as of @xmath104 , to keep the algebra simple we will drop @xmath99 altogether and just assume @xmath105 in the eq .",
    "this is a particularly good approximation at the laboratory magnetic fields at which the inclusion of the higher landau levels is expected to provide corrections to our results of higher order in the small parameter @xmath106 . minimizing the energy in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , for @xmath107 we then find @xmath108 @xmath109 and for @xmath110 , @xmath111 @xmath112    where @xmath113 . with the increase of the zeeman coupling there is a continuous transition at which the nel order disappears , and the magnetization saturates to its maximum ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    note that if the nel vector is constrained to be along the magnetic field , so that @xmath114 , the above quantum critical point becomes replaced with the level crossing between the purely antiferromagnetic ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) and purely ferromagnetic ( @xmath83 , @xmath117 ) ground states @xcite .",
    "such a pure antiferromagnet would correspond to a local maximum of the energy in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , however .",
    "it seems always energetically favorable to compromise between the two competing magnetic orderings by orienting the nel vector orthogonally to the field .",
    "while it is not _ a priori _ clear at which side of the transition should the experimental samples lie at half filling , increasing sufficiently the component of the magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer should always place the system into the purely ferromagnetic state .",
    "the experimental fact that the system at the filling factor zero is dissipative suggests that this is probably already the case even for the magnetic field completely orthogonal to the graphene s plane @xcite .",
    "spin splitting as the origin of the measured gap at half filling has also been suggested very recently in ref .",
    "most importantly , the experiment of jiang et al . offers compelling evidence that the gap at filling factor @xmath1 is independent of the total magnetic field , and thus likely to be a consequence of interactions @xcite . and",
    "this is precisely what follows from our theory @xcite .",
    "when the chemical potential gets close to the energy of the first excited states laying at @xmath118 the hartree - fock ground state energy may always be lowered by developing a finite third nel component @xmath13 .",
    "this pushes half of the states in question below the chemical potential and opens a gap . this way an incompressible state at filling factors @xmath1",
    "would be formed irrespectively of whether @xmath119 was zero or finite at the filling factor zero .",
    "note , however , that the eq .",
    "( 7 ) implies that this mechanism is operative only in the @xmath76 landau level ; the states belonging to the other landau levels do not get split but only shifted in energy when @xmath115 .",
    "consequently , at weak coupling @xmath13 will become finite only in the @xmath1 state and otherwise not .",
    "the incompressible states that follow from the inclusion of a finite chemical potential into eq .",
    "( 3 ) lie therefore only at filling factors @xmath120 , @xmath1 , and all even integers .",
    "let us assume therefore a week third nel component @xmath13 at the filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "the activation gap at this filling then becomes @xmath121 for a small zeeman term , @xmath122 , eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) give then @xmath123 whereas when @xmath124 and @xmath14 , @xmath125 recalling that both @xmath126 and @xmath127 , whereas @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the total and @xmath130 the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , we see that the gap is independent of the field s in - plane component _ only _ in the latter case . the experiment is therefore consistent with @xmath3 at the filling factor @xmath1 , and with @xmath14 at the filling factor zero .",
    "this may not be very surprising in view of the equality between the couplings @xmath52 and @xmath51 at the lattice scale , which makes the critical zeeman coupling @xmath131 likely to be exceeded by the experimental value of @xmath94 @xcite .    finally , restoring a finite range to electron - electron interactions",
    "may replace the antiferromagnetic ground state discussed here with a charge density wave with the particle density alternating ( around the value of unity ) on the two sublattices . in this case",
    "the mean field phase diagram would remain the same as discussed previously in ref .",
    "provided that the on - site repulsion is indeed the dominant effect of the coulomb interaction in graphene , our prediction is that at filing factors @xmath1 and at magnetic fields @xmath132 the system has a weak nel component @xmath133 per electron .",
    "@xmath134 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the inherent weakness of the nel order derives from a small fraction of electrons occupying the relevant @xmath76 landau level , which is the sole source of antiferromagnetism in this case .",
    "the existence of such ordering at the fillings @xmath1 can be used to distinguish the present proposal from all others in the current literature on the subject .",
    "to summarize , the ground - state energy in the hartree - fock approximation to the hubbard model on honeycomb lattice and at half filling is nearly symmetric with respect to rotations between the components of the nel order orthogonal to and the magnetization parallel with the external magnetic field .",
    "the effects of the symmetry breaking terms originating from discreetness of the lattice , zeeman interaction , and @xmath96 landau levels were examined .",
    "it was shown that whereas the component of the nel order parameter parallel to the magnetic field always vanishes at half filling , it becomes finite ( only ) at filling factors @xmath1 , introducing this way a gap in the spectrum .",
    "the existence of such a weak nel order along the magnetic field @xmath135 per electron is proposed as a litmus test of the present theory .",
