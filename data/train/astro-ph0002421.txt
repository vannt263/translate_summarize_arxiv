    "bright infrared ( ir ) sources combined with 30 magnitudes of visual extinction have made the galactic center ( gc ) an attractive line of sight for the study of interstellar dust composition .",
    "absorption features in the spectra of gc ir sources have been used extensively to characterize interstellar grain material , including silicates ( becklin etal .",
    "1978 ; roche & aitken 1985 ) and hydrocarbons ( willner etal .  1979 ; mcfadzean etal .  1989 ; sandford etal .  1991 ; pendleton etal .  1994 ) .",
    "previous observations of the gc suggested the presence of absorptions expected in icy grain material , most notably the 3@xmath0 m band of h@xmath1o - ice ( e.g. , mcfadzean etal .",
    "1989 ) , but until recently , the explanation that one or more molecular clouds obscure the gc and contribute to its total extinction had not been completely accepted since the 3@xmath0 m feature has a substantially different profile than that observed in dense cloud sources ( tielens etal .  1996 ; wada etal .",
    "the presence of molecular cloud material in the gc was confirmed via detection of solid co@xmath1 feature by the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) ( gerakines etal.1999 ; de graauw etal .",
    "1996b ; lutz etal .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "solid organic material is a well - established component of the diffuse interstellar medium . the complex 3.4  feature , ubiquitous along sightlines which sample the diffuse ism in our galaxy and other galaxies ( e.g. pendleton etal .",
    "1994 , bridger , wright , & geballe 1993 ) , is identified with short - chained aliphatic hydrocarbons with a methylene / methyl ( -ch@xmath1-/-ch@xmath3 ) group ratio between 22.5 ( sandford etal .",
    "1991 ; pendleton etal .",
    "the ch deformation mode at 6.8  was detected in kao data ( tielens etal .",
    "1996 ) , although the weaker 7.3  band could not be confirmed at the time .",
    "one model proposes that organic refractory matter in the diffuse ism is the product of energetic processing of simple ices ( such as co , h@xmath1o , ch@xmath3oh ) in dense clouds ( e.g. , allamandola , sandford , & valero 1988 ; greenberg etal .",
    "1995 ; strazzulla , castornia , & palumbo 1995 ; moore , ferrante , & nuth 1996 ) .",
    "however , the discovery of spectroscopic similarity between diffuse interstellar and circumstellar organics has prompted a reassessment of the origin of organic matter in the ism ( lequeux & jourdain de muizon 1990 ; chiar etal .",
    "the striking similarity of the circumstellar and interstellar 3.4  features indicates that at least some of the organic carriers which lead to the 3.4 absorption in the diffuse ism originate as stardust ( chiar etal .",
    "the case for production of the 3.4  band carrier in dense clouds and thus its presence in organic refractory mantles is further weakened by the finding of adamson etal .",
    "( 1999 ) that , unlike the 9.7  silicate feature ( e.g. , aitken etal .",
    "1986 ) , the 3.4  feature along the line of sight toward sgra *  ( irs7 ) is not polarized .",
    "hence , the 3.4  band is not produced by a carrier residing in a mantle on a silicate core , but rather by very small ( unaligned ) grains .",
    "nevertheless , energetic processing of ices in dense clouds may still play some role in the production of interstellar organics since diffuse ism dust cycles into dense clouds fairly rapidly ( @xmath4 years ; mckee 1989 ; jones etal .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) is a possible candidate for the organic component of diffuse interstellar dust ( tielens etal .",
    "1996 ; pendleton etal .",
    "1994 ) , and several laboratory groups are attempting to produce hac analogs with a -ch@xmath1-/-ch@xmath3 ratio which matches the observed feature ( e.g. , furton etal.1999 ; duley etal .",
    "previous comparisons of hacs with the interstellar 3.4  feature have shown that many hacs produced in the laboratory are lacking in -ch@xmath3 groups relative to -ch@xmath1- groups , providing an unsatisfactory fit to the observed feature ( e.g. , pendleton etal .",
    "1994 ) . recently ,",
    "duley etal.(1998 ) have shown that the 3.38  -ch@xmath3 subfeature is strengthened at lower temperatures ( 77k ) , and the resulting hac with -ch@xmath1-/-ch@xmath5 , provides a better match to the 3.4 interstellar feature , compared with higher temperature ( e.g. , 300k ) hacs .",
    "recently , a feature near 6.2  was discovered along sightlines toward the gc quintuplet sources and several dusty late - type wc wolf - rayet stars , and has been attributed to the aromatic c - c stretch in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pah ) in the diffuse ism along the line of sight ( schutte etal .",
    "pahs are a certain component of the carbonaceous material in the galaxy , as shown by the dominance and ubiquitous presence of the family of pah emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3   in diffuse emission in the galactic disk ( giard etal.1988 ; ristorcelli etal .  1994 ;",
    "mattila etal .",
    "therefore , the detection of the aromatic c - c stretch at 6.2  in diffuse ism sightlines is not surprising ; its carrier may be in the form of gaseous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) or pah clusters with sizes up to a few thousand c atoms ( schutte etal .",
    "the corresponding c - h stretch at @xmath6  was not detected in absorption in the diffuse ism , although high signal - to - noise data , necessary to detect this weak feature , were not available for many sightlines .",
    "however , an absorption feature at 3.25 @xmath7 is detected in ground - based data in five heavily extincted molecular cloud sightlines ( sellgren etal .",
    "1995 ; brooke , sellgren , & geballe 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the composition of the hydrocarbon dust component as well as the molecular cloud ices , along the line of sight to the galactic center based on 2.513  spectra from the infrared space observatory s short wavelength spectrometer ( iso - sws ) .",
    "iso - sws had revealed the previously elusive 2.95  nh@xmath3  feature in dense cloud material along the gc line - of - sight .",
    "these observations have also provided us with the first meaningful observations of hydrocarbon modes at long wavelengths ( 58 ) corresponding to the well - studied 3.4  absorption feature , associated with the diffuse ism , allowing us to narrow down the list of possible hydrocarbon candidates (  [ aliphatics ] ) .",
    "we also present the first detection of aromatic absorption , at 3.28 , unassociated with molecular cloud dust .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sources ] we briefly discuss what is known about the nature of the sources , and in  [ obs ] we explain the data reduction , and present the iso - sws spectra of 3 sources in the galactic center . in the following sections , we discuss the nature of the molecular cloud ir absorption features (  [ molecular ] ) and hydrocarbon absorption features (  [ diffuse ] ) along the line of sight .",
    "finally , we discuss possible scenarios for the origin of hydrocarbons in the gc region (  [ discussion ] ) and summarize our results (  [ summary ] ) .",
    "in this paper we analyze spectra from iso - sws for three sightlines toward the galactic center : sgra*(and sgraw - irs3 ) , gcs3 , and gcs4 .",
    "the ir sources contained in the iso beam along the line of sight toward sgra *  and sgraw - irs3 , suffer visual extinction @xmath8 magnitudes ( rieke etal .",

    "gcs3 and 4 , located near the gc radio arc , approximately 14 ne of the galactic center , corresponding to a projected distance of about 30 pc ( assuming a distance of 8.2 kpc ) , were first discovered in the polarimetric study by kobayashi etal .",
    "visual extinction estimates are similar to that for the gc , @xmath9@xmath10 magnitudes ( figer etal .",

    "detailed imaging of the region revealed that gcs3 and 4 consist of a compact group of at least 5 ir sources , which have since become known as the infrared quintuplet ( nagata etal .",
    "1990 ; okuda etal.1990 ) , although more recent imaging and spectroscopic investigations ( moneti etal .  1992 , 1994 ) have shown that this region contains several bright and many faint ir sources .",
    "the nature of these objects is still a question of debate : several studies have suggested that the quintuplet cluster consists of young stars surrounded by thick shells or cocoons of hot dust ( e.g. , moneti etal .",
    "a very recent photometric study has proposed that these stars are actually massive late - type dusty wc wolf - rayet stars ( figer , mclean , & morris 1999 ) .",
    "infrared spectra of sagittarius a * ( lutz etal .  1996 ) , sagittarius a w - irs3 , and quintuplet ( afgl 2004 ) sources gcs3 and gcs4 were obtained with iso - sws in 1996 and 1997 .",

    "1996 ; wada etal .  1991 ; tielens & allamandola 1987 ) , the absence of this band in local sightlines through the diffuse ism sheds some doubt on that interpretation ( e.g. whittet etal .",

    "1998 ) . given the greater depth of the 3.0  ice band in sgra * , compared to gcs3 and gcs4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all_full ] ) , the 6.0  band of this source is likely to contain a dominant ice component .",
    "determination of the 6  profile for sgra *  depends heavily on the choice of continuum , leading to uncertainties in the red side of the profile and peak optical depth , and minor changes in the peak position .",

    "most of the 6  absorption in protostellar objects is explained by simple amorphous h@xmath1o - ice mixtures , so we first attempt to match the gc 3- and 6-  profiles with only pure h@xmath1o - ice ( using laboratory data from leiden observatory s database at : http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/@xmath17lab/ ) .",
    "this procedure shows that fitting the 6  band with pure h@xmath1o - ice causes the optical depth of the 3  band to be overestimated by a factor of 23.5 for all 3 objects .",

    "[ fig : bigfits ] ( bottom panels ) for sgra * and in fig .",
    "[ fig : quints ] for gcs3 ( top panels ) and 4 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the mixture used , amorphous h@xmath1o  at 30k is a realistic analog for ices in these sightlines , and provides the best fit to the sgra *  6  profile when the 3  spectrum is ignored .",
    "such a discrepancy between the 3 and 6  h@xmath1o - ice optical depth has been noted for some massive young stellar objects ( gibb etal .",
    "2000 ; keane etal .",
    "2000 ) . for these sources scattering at near - ir wavelengths in the disk - like environment of the protostar may reduce the apparent optical depth at 3.0   ( pendleton etal .",
    "for the galactic center sources , ice absorption is not local to the sources but rather occurs along the line - of - sight and , hence , this effect should not play a role .",
    "thus , we conclude that , despite the good fit , the 6.0  band can not be due to h@xmath1o - ice alone .",
    "the 3  band towards sgra *  shows an excess blue absorption wing relative to other observed interstellar ice bands ( cf .",

    "moreover , the 6.85  optical depth is very similar in the three galactic center sources despite the large differences in ice optical depth .",
    "therefore , we attribute the 6.85  feature to dust in the diffuse interstellar medium , related to the 3.4  aliphatic hydrocarbon feature , rather than molecular cloud ices .        all the gc sources show evidence for the presence of a 6.2   ( fwhm @xmath47 cm@xmath22 ) feature . this feature has been previously detected in iso spectra of gc sources and 4 wolf - rayet stars and",

    "the 6.2  profiles presented here were determined by first finding a satisfactory fit to the 3- and 6-  ice features as described in  [ ices ] , then subtracting this `` fit '' from the 6  absorption feature to obtain a residual spectrum ( figs .",

    "the excellent match of the red wing of the profiles gives us confidence that sgra *  does contain the same 6.2  feature seen in gcs3 , 4 and the wr stars .",

    "the source with the strongest ice bands ( sgra * ) has the smallest 6.2  feature .",
    "for all the sources studied , there appears to be a trend of increasing 6.2  feature depth with @xmath9  and @xmath48 ( schutte etal .",
    "1998 ) , however the depth of the 6.2  feature in the sgra *  spectrum seems to be anomalously weak with respect to its 9.7  silicate optical depth and its extinction , compared to sources in the solar neighborhood ( schutte etal .",
    "1998 ) and gcs3 and 4 .",
    "a depth of @xmath49 would be expected for sgra *  if this quantity was correlated with the silicate depth . in contrast , the observed depth is only 0.05 ( table  2 ) .",

    "we note that the total visual extinction ( @xmath9 ) also seems to vary independently of the 9.7  silicate band ( roche & aitken 1985 ) .",
    "presence of aromatic hydrocarbons can also be determined from observations of the complimentary 3.3  c - h stretch feature .",
    "this feature is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the aot6 spectrum of gcs 3 exhibits a weak absorption feature centered at 3.28 , with @xmath50cm@xmath22 , which we attribute to the c - h stretch in aromatic hydrocarbons ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gcs3_organics ] ) .",
    "the c - h stretch in solid methane occurs near 3.32 , far from the observed feature , therefore we can rule out methane as a possible candidate for the absorption .",
    "the lower resolution / signal - to - noise aot1 spectrum is also consistent with the presence of absorption centered at 3.28 .",
    "presence of this feature in the aot1 spectrum of gcs4 can not be ruled out .",
    "an absorption feature centered at @xmath51  ( @xmath52=74cm@xmath22 ) has been detected in molecular cloud sources and is attributed to aromatic hydrocarbon molecules at low temperature ( sellgren etal .",
    "1995 ; brooke etal .",
    "the difference in central wavelength and width between these different environments can not be accounted for by uncertainties in the continuum fit , but rather demonstrates the difference in the temperature and/or carrier of the aromatic material in these regions .",
    "although there is a strong pfund @xmath53 atomic hydrogen line at 3.30 , there is no evidence for an underlying absorption feature at 3.28 , to a limit of @xmath54 , in the sgra * spectrum .",
    "this limit is consistent with the weakness of the 6.2  aromatic band in sgra * , thus we conclude that the 3.28  and 6.2  feature are due to the same material .",
    "gas - phase pahs are not a likely carrier of the 3.28  absorption feature : based on the temperature dependence of the gas - phase pah profile determined in the laboratory by joblin etal .",
    "( 1995 ) , a temperature of 600 - 1300 k is implied for the feature observed toward gcs3 .",
    "while such a high temperature is consistent with pah emission - indeed 3.28  is also the position of the unidentified infrared emission feature - to get a pah absorption feature would require an extraordinarily large column of hot gas .",
    "comparison of the peak positions of matrix - isolated laboratory pahs given by hudgins & sandford ( 1998a,1998b ) with our astronomical data show that neutral pahs such as pyrene frozen in ices may be a good candidate for the observed feature .",
    "laboratory studies carried out in the astrophysics laboratory at nasa ames of pyrene in h@xmath1o  ice show a fair match to the 3.28 feature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sgra_pah ] ) .",
    "however , this does not provide simultaneously a good fit to the observed interstellar 6.2  band ( cf .",
    ",  [ nightmare ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : sgra_pah ] ) .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by schutte etal .",
    "( 1998 ) , neutral pahs have too weak an absorption feature to account for the observed strength of the 6.2  feature .",
    "for that reason , schutte etal .",
    "( 1998 ) attributed the 6.2  band to ionized pahs whose cc modes are intrinsically much stronger .",
    "nevertheless , this assignment still requires 10% of the available carbon in the form of pah cations for gcs3 and 4 .",
    "an origin of the 3.28  band in hacs is also possible .",
    "hacs , when heated , lose much of their hydrogen and their aromatic component grows in strength .",
    "the spectral characteristics of heat - treated hacs ( scott & duley 1996 ; blanco etal .",
    "1988 ) resemble those observed toward gcs3 . at present",
    ", we can not distinguish observationally whether free - flying , ionized pahs or hacs are the carriers of the 3.28  band in the diffuse ism .",
    "whereas the distribution of aliphatic hydrocarbon dust , detected via the 3.4 , 6.85 , and 7.25  features , toward the gc shows little variation , aromatic hydrocarbons identified via their c - h stretch ( 3.28 ) and c - c stretch ( 6.2 ) , however , may not be evenly distributed throughout the gc region (  [ aromatics ] ) .",
    "it has recently been proposed that the quintuplet sources are dusty late - type wc stars .",
    "wc stars are descendants of massive ( @xmath55m@xmath56 ) ob stars where substantial mass loss and mixing have uncovered freshly synthesized material at the stellar surface .",
    "these objects are rich in he , c , and o ( @xmath57 10:3:1 by number ) , but there is no evidence for h or n ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 relative to he by number ; willis 1982 ; nugis 1982 ; torres 1988 ) .",
    "thus , aromatic dust associated with the 6.2  c - c stretch feature , detected toward gcs3 , gcs4 , and the well - known wr stars , may instead be associated with the environment of these objects instead of the general diffuse ism .",
    "one of the ir sources ( irs6e ) included in the iso - sws beam centered on sgra *  has been identified as a late - type wc star ( krabbe etal .",
    "1995 ) ; this may explain the presence of a small amount of 6.2   absorption ( relative to its deep 9.7  silicate feature ) .",
    "however , while the wc stars may be responsible for producing the carrier(s ) of the c - c stretch ( 6.2 ) , they can not be a significant contributor to the carrier(s ) of the c - h stretch ( 3.28 ) .",
    "presently , the connection between 3.28 and 6.2  absorption features is not well established observationally .",
    "various models have been proposed for the origin and evolution of these dust components  ices , aliphatic , and aromatic dust  in the ism . of particular relevance are the processing of interstellar ices leading to organic grains ( greenberg 1989 ) and the processing of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( scott & duley 1996 ; blanco etal .",
    "ices are generally thought to form by accretion on preexisting silicate cores inside dense molecular clouds .",
    "these ices can be photolyzed by penetrating uv photons and may be converted into an organic refractory mantle .",
    "laboratory studies have shown that this process may lead to a material with ir characteristics matching the observed interstellar 3.4  bands well ( greenberg etal.1995 ; allamandola , sandford , & valero 1988 ) .",
    "however , such residues invariably show much stronger absorption in the 5 - 8 @xmath0 m range due to residual oxygen bonded to the carbon structures .",
    "such bands are not observed in the spectra of sources showing the 3.4 @xmath0 m feature ( figs .",
    "[ fig : gcs3_6mic ] , [ fig : sgra_diffuse ] ) .",
    "our results thus strengthen the argument ( chiar etal .",
    "1998b ; adamson etal .  1999",
    "; see  [ intro ] ) that the 3.4  carrier is not an organic refractory mantle produced by irradiation of ices in molecular clouds .",
    "alternatively , hac , which in structure is akin to soot , could be an important stardust component injected into the ism by low mass stars during the agb phase of their evolution , in agreement with the strength of the 3.4  absorption band in the protoplanetary object crl 618 ( chiar etal .",
    "1998b ) . extensive analysis of interstellar observations require that the amount of c locked up in hac relative to h - nuclei is @xmath60 ( furton etal .",
    "this depends on the extent to which the carbonaceous material is hydrogenated , but the adopted value h / c@xmath61 is most consistent with other hac properties ( furton etal.1999 ) . it has been suggested that hac could also be formed through accretionary processes in the diffuse ism but plausible chemical mechanisms have not been identified ( duley & williams 1995 ) .",
    "nevertheless , hacs are thought to evolve in the diffuse ism : under the influence of fuv irradiation ( or heating ) , hacs lose h and their structure is transformed from an aliphatic structure into a more aromatic structure ( ogmen & duley 1988 ; furton & witt 1993 ) .",
    "this process will be counteracted by hydrogenation . in photodissociation regions ,",
    "the astrophysical sites of these processes , both uv irradiation and exposure to atomic hydrogen will occur at the same time ( furton & witt 1993 ) .",
    "the relative amount of aromatic and aliphatic carbon is then set by the balance between these two processes and this will determine the relative strength of the 3.3 ( and 6.2 )  band compared to the 3.4  band .",
    "we note here that , if the 3.3 and 6.2 bands observed in gcs 3 are associated with the diffuse ism rather than circumstellar dust , we may actually be observing both the aromatic and aliphatic components involved in this process along these lines of sight .",
    "however , models of this type have problems too . in particular ,",
    "theoretical studies of dust destruction and observational studies of elemental depletions suggest that the lifetime of stardust is much shorter ( @xmath62 yr ) than the injection timescale by old stars ( @xmath63 yr ) , which suggests that dust formation in the ism is very important ( jones etal .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "now , in the models , ices accreted inside dense molecular clouds , would be rapidly destroyed when the molecular cloud is dispersed . in an evolutionary sense , ices would have little influence on the dust composition in the diffuse ism .",
    "however , it has been suggested that organic residues produced by uv photolysis of interstellar ices are rapidly carbonized ( h , o , and n are lost ) by the strong far - uv fields in the diffuse ism and that this leads to a hac - like mantle ( jenniskens etal .",
    "it remains puzzling then that , while interstellar ice , as well as silicate , features can be polarized , the 3.4  aliphatic hydrocarbon feature is not ( adamson etal .",
    "possibly , this might imply a link between the aliphatic hydrocarbon carriers of the 3.4  feature and the aromatic carrier of the 2175  bump which is also not polarized ( martin etal .",
    "1999 ) . in any case , a hac - like material with very little oxygen impurities , is the carrier of the 3.4 , 6.85 , and 7.25  features .",
    "further observations , particularly of the 3.28 , 3.4 , and 6.2 @xmath0 m bands will be instrumental in settling the origin and evolution of this component .",
    "we have identified molecular cloud and diffuse interstellar medium material along the line of sight to the galactic center using iso - sws data for 3 sightlines .",
    "the amount of molecular cloud material varies across the gc field , and the amount of diffuse ism material shows little variation .",
    "this is supported by our observations of the 3 h@xmath1o - ice feature which ranges between @xmath64 , and the 3.4  aliphatic hydrocarbon feature which ranges between @xmath65 .",
    "the line of sight towards sgra *  contains the largest column of molecular cloud material , relative to gcs3 and 4 , apparent from the depth of the 3  ice feature . towards all gc sources discussed in the present paper , co@xmath1 ice",
    "is detected , and co is present mainly in the gas phase . towards sgra * , solid ch@xmath2has also been firmly identified . as the amount of solid co@xmath1 relative to h@xmath1o  is higher toward the quintuplet sources compared to sgra * , there may be more than one molecular cloud associated with the overall gc region .",
    "however , the processes that control the solid co@xmath1 abundance are not well understood ( e.g. , whittet etal .",
    "1998 ; gerakines etal .",
    "1999 )    in many ways , the molecular clouds along the line of sight toward the galactic center are similar to local molecular clouds in terms of abundances of key solid state molecules ( table  6 ) . water - ice remains the most abundant solid state molecule ; the solid co@xmath1/h@xmath1o  ratio is within the range found for local molecular clouds ( gerakines etal .",
    "1999 ) ; ch@xmath3oh / h@xmath1o  is similar to that observed in quiescent clouds such as taurus ( chiar etal .",

    "iso - sws has for the first time detected the corresponding c - h deformation modes at 6.85 and 7.25  in the line of sight towards the galactic center .",

    "<S> hydrocarbon dust in the diffuse interstellar medium along the line of sight to the gc is characterized by absorption features centered at 3.4 @xmath0 m , 6.85 @xmath0 m , and 7.25 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> ground - based studies have identified the 3.4 @xmath0 m feature with aliphatic hydrocarbons , and iso has given us the first meaningful observations of the corresponding modes at longer wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated strengths of these three features suggest that hydrogenated amorphous carbon is their carrier . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute an absorption feature centered at 3.28 @xmath0 m in the gcs3 spectrum to the c - h stretch in aromatic hydrocarbons . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is not detected , and its c - c stretch counterpart appears to be weaker , in the sgra *  spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key questions which now arises is whether aromatics are a widespread component of the diffuse interstellar medium , analogous to aliphatic hydrocarbons . </S>"
