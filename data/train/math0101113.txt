    "[ s1 ] the tricomi operator @xmath1 one of the simplest examples of a partial differential operator of _ mixed type _ , is : ( i ) _ elliptic _ in the upper half plane ( @xmath2 ) ; _ parabolic _ along the @xmath3-axis ( @xmath4 ) ; and ( iii ) _ hyperbolic _ in the lower half plane ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "our aim is to obtain explicit solutions in the sense of distributions or generalized functions of the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dirac function at @xmath8 an arbitrary point in the plane . a solution @xmath9 of ( [ eq1c ] ) is said to be a _ fundamental solution relative to the point @xmath8 . _    in a previous paper @xcite we considered the case when @xmath10 and proved the existence of two remarkable fundamental solutions that clearly reflect the fact that the operator changes type across the @xmath3-axis . in this paper",
    "we study the general case when @xmath11 and compare our results to those of @xcite .    for sake of completeness and in order to make the reading of this paper independent of that of @xcite",
    ", we briefly review the contents of that paper .",
    "it is known that the equation @xmath12 defines the two characteristics for the tricomi operator that emanate from the origin .",
    "these characteristics , which are tangent to the @xmath13-axis at the origin , divide the plane in two disjoint regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( figure 1 ) defined as follows : @xmath16 the region `` outside '' the characteristics , and @xmath17 the region `` inside '' the characteristics .",
    "figure 1    the first fundamental solution is defined by    @xmath18    with @xmath19 and the second one is defined by @xmath20 with @xmath21 in the expressions of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 the constant @xmath24 is the value of the hypergeometric function @xmath0 at @xmath25    we remark that in @xcite the constants @xmath22 and @xmath26 were respectively denoted by @xmath27 at that time , we were unaware of the role played by the hypergeometric function @xmath0 in the study of fundamental solutions for the tricomi operator .",
    "we also observe that according to formula ( [ eq1b ] ) , a perturbation at the origin spreads out to the entire region @xmath28 inside the characteristics . on the other hand , according to formula ( [ eq1a ] ) , the same perturbation spreads out to the whole elliptic region ( @xmath2 ) and also to the hyperbolic region ( @xmath5 ) outside the characteristics . since the tricomi operator is invariant under translations along the @xmath3-axis , the same phenomena take place for fundamental solutions that correspond to the dirac measure @xmath29 concentrated at an arbitrary point @xmath30 on the @xmath3-axis",
    ".    it is well know that the tricomi operator describes the transition from subsonic flow ( elliptic region ) to supersonic flow ( hyperbolic region ) . in the extensive literature on the tricomi operator",
    "one finds in the works of several authors , among others , agmon @xcite , friedrichs @xcite , gelfand [ unpublished ] , germain and bader @xcite , landau and lifshitz @xcite , leray @xcite , and morawetz @xcite , a large number of examples of solutions to different problems that show the interaction between these two regions .",
    "it seems that the two distributions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the simplest of such examples .",
    "we now return to equation ( [ eq1c ] ) . in view of the invariance of the tricomi operator under translations parallel to the @xmath3-axis ,",
    "the problem of solving that equation is equivalent to that of solving @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an arbitrary real number and @xmath35 denotes the dirac measure concentrated at the point @xmath36    consider the case @xmath37 , that is , the point @xmath38 is situated in the hyperbolic region .",
    "we introduce the _ characteristic coordinates _ @xmath39 set @xmath40 and to let @xmath41 be such that @xmath42 note that @xmath43 represents the point @xmath38 in characteristic coordinates .",
    "as shown    figure 2    in figure 2 , two characteristics with equations @xmath44 pass through the point @xmath36 in characteristic coordinates , these are the two half - lines @xmath45 that originate from the point @xmath46    the characteristics ( [ ch1 ] ) meet the @xmath3-axis , respectively , at the points @xmath30 and @xmath47 two new characteristics originate from these two points , namely , @xmath48 which we call _ reflected characteristics .",
    "_ the corresponding equations in characteristic coordinates are @xmath49    the two characteristics through the point @xmath38 and the reflected characteristics divide the plane into four disjoint regions denoted by @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 and illustrated in figure 2 .    in this paper , we show existence of four fundamental solutions each supported by the closure of the corresponding region . of these solutions ,",
    "only two have physical meaning : the one defined in the region @xmath54 and the other defined in the region @xmath55 this situation is similar to what happens in the case of the wave operator in two dimensions where the two relevant fundamental solutions are the ones supported by the forward and backward light - cones . as we will see , it is the hypergeometric function @xmath0 that plays a crucial role in defining these four fundamental solutions .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we prove in section [ s2 ] that the function @xmath56 is a solution of @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the _ reduced hyperbolic _",
    "tricomi equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .    after replacing into ( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 by their expressions in ( [ ch0 ] )",

    "the region @xmath54 is entirely contained in the hyperbolic region where it is natural to use characteristic coordinates .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] is then proved , via integration by parts and by using the results of proposition [ pr1 ] . as a consequence of it",
    "we show that , as @xmath38 tends to @xmath65 @xmath62 tends , in the sense of distributions , to @xmath66 the fundamental solution defined by ( [ eq1b ] ) .",
    "the fundamental solutions supported by the closure of the regions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined and studied in section [ s4 ] . in both regions , it is necessary to take into account the singularities of @xmath69 along the reflected characteristics .",
    "the results of proposition [ pr2 ] , that describe the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric function @xmath0 as @xmath70 are then needed in the proof of theorem [ th3 ] .",

    ", we mention that in his paper @xcite , j.  leray described a general method , based upon the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables to find fundamental solutions for a class of hyperbolic linear differential operator with analytic coefficients .",
    "in particular , he showed how his method could be used to obtain , in the hyperbolic region , a fundamental solution for the tricomi operator relative to a point @xmath36 he also produced an explicit formula for the fundamental solution in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath0 .",
    "our method is simpler , more direct , and gives us global fundamental solutions that clearly reflect the change of type of the tricomi operator across the @xmath3-axis .",
