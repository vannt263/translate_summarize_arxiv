    "the presence of broad emission lines is a very distinctive feature of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) and seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "these lines are emitted by gas located in the vicinity of the central engine photoionized by the strong ionizing continuum radiation .",
    "the large width of the emission lines requires velocities well in excess of @xmath3 .",
    "line profile and relative intensity studies provide very imporant clues on the gas velocity distribution and on the physical conditions in the line emitting region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    a huge amount of information can however be gathered by studying the variability properties of the emission lines . because line emission is driven by the variable continuum from the central engine , the broad emission lines vary in response to the continuum variations . as different parts of the line emitting region",
    "respond with different delays depending on their locations , variability can be used as a tool to map the entire gas phase - space distribution @xcite .",
    "this provides very important insights on the global dynamics of the system , and much effort has been devoted to the development of analysis methods of emission line light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a very important recent result is the fact that the large emission line widths are to a large extent due to keplerian motions around supermassive objects , and that this effect provides a way to estimate black hole masses @xcite .    is a quite peculiar radio - loud qso that exhibits , depending on the wavelength domain , the properties of both blazars and seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has been intensively observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum for more than 3 decades as part of a large collaboration @xcite , and in particular throughout the mission of the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) satellite , which can observe at wavelengths close to the ionizing continuum , and is particularly well adapted to the study of important emission lines like  ( for sufficiently redshifted objects ) and .    in this paper , we extend a previous study of the ultraviolet and optical continuum emission @xcite , and focus on the  and  emission line variability based on archival iue spectra of c. previous works on  variability in c  provided conflicting results .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite detected significant line variability , @xcite found no compelling evidence of variability .",
    "these studies used only a part of the entire iue data set ; we add here about 5 years of data , which doubles the period of time with dense sampling . with the addition of these new data ,",
    "variability is now clearly detected , and an analysis of  is even possible .",
    "morevover , the sampling is now sufficient to perform detailed analyses of the light curves , which allow us to attempt to constrain the geometry and the velocity field of the emitting gas .    throughout this paper , the quoted wavelengths are observed wavelengths ,",
    "while the doppler velocities and the time lags are expressed in the rest frame of c , i.e. corrected for a redshift of @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is based on data from the c  database hosted by the geneva observatory and presented in @xcite .",
    "the data that are used here are the iue short wavelength ( swp ) spectra processed with the iue newly extracted spectra ( ines ) software @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of sparse observations from 1978 until 1985 , followed by ten years with an observation rate of about once every 2 weeks during two annual observation periods of 3 months , separated by 2 months .",
    "two swp observations were often performed consecutively to improve photometric accuracy . in total , 256 swp observations have been performed on 142 different days .      since the inclusion of low quality spectra adds noise or even spurious features to the results , we apply strict selection criteria .",
    "we first reject the small aperture spectra and those flagged as dubious in @xcite , to which must be added the swp46739ll spectrum , because of absence of guiding during the exposure . considering only the ranges between 1260 and 1560  for , and between 1680 and 1980  for , we discard spectra clearly contaminated by cosmic rays , those with 10 or more saturated spectral bins at the top of , as well as those with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) below 15 on average .",
    "the last two selection criteria are similar to the rejection of over- and under - exposed spectra applied by @xcite and @xcite . to ensure that differences between   and  are not due to a different sampling",
    ", we use an identical set of spectra for both lines .    as in those previous two studies",
    ", we correct for the iue wavelength scale uncertainty by applying small wavelength shifts ( @xmath5 ) to the 186 remaining spectra . overlooking this point",
    "can introduce spurious asymmetric line variability , and can change the line profile in the rms spectrum ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : profiles ] ) .",
    "the wavelength correction has been calculated by placing the gaussian fitted peak of the  line at its expected rest wavelength of 1407.7 .",
    "finally , after averaging all spectra taken within 12 hours , we end up with a set of 119 good quality swp spectra of c.      the  flux ( including ) is measured relative to a continuum defined by a straight line fitted to the points in two 50   continuum bands at 12601310 and 15101560 .",
    "we integrate the total line flux for doppler velocities up to 20000 , i.e.  from 1314 to 1501 .",
    "the  flux was measured similarly , with the continuum bands at 16801730 and 19401980 . to avoid strong contamination by ,",
    "we integrate  only for velocities up to 10000 , i.e. from 1732 to 1851 , the observed line center being at @xmath61791.4 .",
    "unfortunately , this wavelength is nearly coincident with an iue reseau mark . in the three spectra taken before 1980",
    ", this mark results in a very clear absorption - like feature , that we correct by interpolating linearly above the affected wavelength bins .",
    "the line flux uncertainty is calculated by taking into account both the flux error in each spectral bin and an estimate of the uncertainty induced by the fit to the continuum . as the resolution of iue is about 6  and the spectral bins are @xmath61.7  wide , the spectral bins are not completely independent .",
    "we take this into account by multiplying the uncertainty resulting from the individual flux errors by @xmath7 .",
    "it can be very easily seen that the uncertainty induced by the fit is expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wavelength range of line integration and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the continuum fit uncertainties at @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we also extract a continuum flux averaged over the 1250 - 1300  range . the same provision for non - independent spectral bins",
    "is taken to estimate the continuum flux uncertainty .",
    "the average uncertainties obtained with the above method are respectively 2% for the continuum , and 3.5% for  and .",
    "however , a _ structure function analysis _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives average uncertainties exceeding the above ones by factors 1.6 , 1.2 , and 2 respectively .",
    "this means that the ines uncertainties are slightly underestimated ( which we have confirmed using a single - bin , continuum light curve ) .",
    "we therefore apply these correction factors to our continuum , , and  light curves .",
    "we finally obtain average uncertainties of 3.5% , 4.5% , and 7% , respectively .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_rms]a we compare the average  emission line profile and the root - mean - square ( rms ) profile .",
    "the rms profile is defined as in @xcite .",
    "the rms  profile is comparably broader than the average profile , which indicates that the wings of this line are much more variable than its core .",
    "another significant difference is an excess in the blue wing variability ( around @xmath14 ) .",
    "the contamination of  by the  line in its red wing ( around @xmath15 ) is visible , but relatively small .",
    "the  rms profile shows similar features , but with a lesser s / n .",

    "the peak - to - peak variability of the  light curve is @xmath650% of the mean line flux ( @xmath660% for ) .",
    "this is about three times the value found by @xcite , whose study could not benefit from the data obtained after july 1992 . the relative variability , defined as the ratio of the standard deviation corrected for the average uncertainty to the mean flux @xcite , is @xmath18 for , @xmath19 for , and @xmath20 for the continuum .",
    "visual comparison between figs  [ fig : lcurve]a , [ fig : lcurve]b , and [ fig : lcurve]c shows that the  and  light curves vary on significantly longer time scales than the continuum , one huge bump lasting at least 4 years dominating the line variability . on short time scales however , the continuum and line light curves are quite similar , as each peak in the line light curves can be found in the continuum .",
    "the average post-1992 line flux is significantly higher than that observed until then .",
    "this variability on long time scales could not be observed in previous studies ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only based on earlier data . as a consequence , this study can explore new facets of ( in particular )  emission properties .",
    "we perform cross - correlation analyses with our data using two different methods : the interpolated cross - correlation function method ( iccf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as implemented by @xcite , and the @xmath21-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of a period with poor sampling ( before 1985 ) can in principle strongly affect the iccf because of interpolation .",
    "we checked however that the effect is negligible in our case by comparing the iccfs of the full data set with those using only post-1985 data .",
    "we therefore keep below the full set of data for consistency with the other analyses presented here .",
    "[ fig : croco ] shows the correlation between the 1250 - 1300   continuum and the  and  emission lines obtained with the two methods .",

    "the significance of the departure of the correlation point at lag @xmath22yr from the iccf is however only about 2@xmath23 .",
    "qualitatively , the correlations exhibit a rapid increase of the correlation for @xmath24 , as expected if the lines are driven by the uv continuum .",

    "[ fig : croco ] can be compared to fig .",
    "9c of @xcite .",
    "their cross - correlation drops to zero after a bit more than one year , much more rapidly than what we observe .",
    "this discrepancy is assuredly the result of the fact that long - time scale variability was absent ( or negligible ) in the data set they have used .",
    "@xcite , whose data set consists essentially of post-1992 observations , find a closer , but still smaller , value of about @xmath26yr for h@xmath0 , h@xmath27 , and h@xmath28 .",
    "it can be noted however that these low - ionization lines are expected to lie farther away from the central engine than  and .",
    "an interesting difference between the cross - correlations with   and  is that the cross - correlation is markedly lower for lags smaller than 0.5yr in the case of . in particular , the peak at 0.2yr visible in the  iccf is completely absent in the   iccf .",
    "the correlation at 0 lag is about 0.1 for , compared to more than 0.4 for",
    ". the other parts of the correlations are very similar in both lines .    if two time series are causally related by a response function ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : response ] ) , the width of the correlation peak is due in part to the response function , and in part to the autocorrelation of the driving time series ( technically , the correlation is the convolution of the autocorrelation with the response function ) .",
    "it is therefore important to test whether the broad correlation peaks in figs  [ fig : croco]a and b could be due to the autocorrelation of the ultraviolet continuum .",
    "[ fig : croco]c shows the autocorrelation functions ( acfs ) of the continuum , , and  light curves calculated using the same method as the iccfs .",
    "to get rid of the effect of uncertainties , which makes comparisons between acfs difficult , we normalized the autocorrelations so that they equal @xmath29 for a very small non - null lag @xmath30yr .",
    "the uv continuum acf shows a very narrow central peak with a fwhm of about @xmath31yr , dropping to almost @xmath32 at @xmath33yr .",

    "we find indeed that already the third eigenvector pseudo - light curves have a nearly flat sf , which means that they are most probably dominated by statistical fluctuations .",
    "in this analysis , we have used difficult techniques , some of them ( in particular the 2d response function ) pushing the data to their limit .",

    "[ fig : profile ] ) and those obtained with the pca ( fig .",

    "the same asymmetry at long lags is also evident in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "some asymmetry at small lags in the form of a small excess in the red wing is also observed in the iccf cross - correlations .",
    "however , their absence from zdcf cross - correlations and from the 2d response function and pca profiles makes the reality of this effect doubtful .    in the rest of the section ,",

    "the symmetric profile is easily explained in terms of non - organized velocity field , in particular keplerian motions around a central black hole .",
    "the existence of such velocity fields in agn has been shown by @xcite .",
    "the signature of keplerian motions in 2d response functions is a symmetric envelope whose width decreases as @xmath82 ( where @xmath42 is the lag ) .",
    "this general behavior is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : resp2d ] , where response at lags @xmath83yr occupies a much larger velocity range than that at longer lags . elliptical ( i.e. , with a continuous distribution of eccentricities between @xmath32 and @xmath29 ) , rather than circular , trajectories with random inclinations seem to match best our observations , as there is little response at large velocities for very small lags in the latter case @xcite .",
    "a keplerian disk emission is also often considered as a potential source of emission lines in agn .",
    "the accretion disk of c  is very probably close to face - on .",
    "superluminal velocities with @xmath84 @xcite indeed imply that the angle between the jet ( thought to be perpendicular to the disk ) and the line of sight is at most @xmath85 .",
    "in such situation , the predicted response function is much flatter than that of a spherical shell ( see fig .",
    "5d in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which does not match well the observed response functions .    the theoretical envelopes of a 2d response function for a keplerian circular velocity field with random inclinations for two different black - hole masses ( @xmath86 and @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : resp2d ] . these envelopes",
    "more or less define the observable upper and lower limits to the 2d response function of any cloud ensemble in gravitational equilibrium with random inclinations . while the 2d response function is too noisy to provide an accurate measurement of the black - hole mass",
    ", we note that there is significant response beyond the @xmath86-m@xmath2 envelope ( in particular at short lags ) , which is evidence that a @xmath1-m@xmath2 black hole might be required .",
    "because of the disk orientation , disk blr models would require a black hole 25 times more massive than circular or elliptic models , which can probably be ruled out .",
    "the existence of asymmetry requires that the velocity distributions on both sides of the accretion disk differ .",
    "taken at face value , the results of the three different analyses all imply that , under the assumption that the ultraviolet continuum entirely drives the line emission , there is a significant excess of line - emitting gas animated by blue - shifted velocities from 2000 to 10000  and responding with delays of a few years .",
    "this corresponds to the prediction for an infall where cloud velocity increases as clouds approach the black hole ( see fig .  2 @xmath87 from @xcite ; as the diagram is for outflowing gas , the symmetric around the @xmath88 axis",
    "must be considered ) .",
    "assuming free - fall of clouds stationary at infinite distance , it is possible to observe a given velocity for a given black - hole mass at lags 4 times larger than in the case of a circular velocity field .",
    "therefore , a 10000   velocity can be observed at a lag of 2yr if the black - hole mass is about @xmath89 m@xmath2 , which is slightly higher than the estimate using the symmetric part of the line .",
    "it must be noted however that infall should produce an excess of response and very strong variability at short lags for high redshifted velocities , which is not observed .",
    "indeed , table  [ tab : var ] shows that , on the contrary , the blue wings are much more variable . if the clouds were optically thick , this absence of redshifted line emission could be explained by intra - cloud obscuration masking the emission of the infalling clouds located between us and the continuum source ; however , for optically thin clouds , this argument is not valid .",
    "the ratio between short- and long - lag response is about twice as large in  compared to . to explain this difference",
    ", one would have to assume that the gas in virial motion has lower  emissivity compared to the free - falling gas ( due , for instance , to a lower metallicity ) .",
    "although this can not be excluded , we do not see a natural scenario resulting in such a configuration .",
    "the existence of blue - shifted , high - velocity clouds seems inescapable .",
    "however , the fact that they are found at large lags is only required under the assumption that all line emission is driven by the ultraviolet continuum .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed comparison between the ultraviolet and optical continuum properties of c  using the same iue data set as here and a very intensive optical campaign covering a large fraction of the iue campaign .",
    "they found that , while presenting strong similarities ( all peaks in the ultraviolet are found in the optical light curve ) , the optical light curve presents long - term variations that are absent in the ultraviolet .",
    "they concluded on the basis of spectral and polarimetric arguments that this slowly varying component ( called @xmath90 ) may be the synchrotron part of the blazar ( synchrotron optical flares have been detected on several occasions in c @xcite ) .",
    "the long - term variability properties of the line emission and of the @xmath90 component are remarkably similar ( see fig .  8 in * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that the slowly - varying line emission and the synchrotron radiation have the same origin , we readily find an explanation for the high , blue - shifted velocities : clouds that pass in the vicinity of the jet may be entrained by it , creating , because of the geometry of c , an outflow in the direction of the observer ( clouds on the other side of the disk , which should be similarly redshifted , may be masked by the disk ) .",
    "similar entrainment has been directly observed by @xcite in 3c  277.3 .",
    "line excitation by the jet is probably not due to its ionizing radiation : the synchrotron component is much weaker than the blue - bump in the ultraviolet domain , and the compton component emits significantly only at much higher energies .",
    "the large amount of infrared radiation emitted by the jet raises however the interesting possibility that it can be an important source of gas heating , and therefore of collisional excitation .",
    "this idea has been developed by @xcite , and the authors have found strong evidence that this type of excitation takes place in radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this model is that  is much more sensitive to collisional excitation than , which explains why the slowly varying component is comparatively much stronger in  than in .",
    "the correlation with the ultraviolet continuum at large lag would either be due to a statistical coincidence in the blue - bump and synchrotron light curves , or be the result of an unknown interaction between these two components .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the  and  emission line properties in c. using three different analysis methods , we find completely consistent results , namely that both  and   are correlated with the ultraviolet continuum up to large lags of @xmath91yr , that part of the lines follows quite closely the continuum variations , and that there is a strong excess of line emission at high , blue - shifted velocities ( up to @xmath3 ) and large lags ( up to 3yr at least ) .",
    "the most significant difference between  and  is that , in the latter , this asymmetric excess is comparatively much stronger .",
    "the  and  response function are roughly compatible with a spherically symmetric gas distribution between a minimum distance of @xmath92lyr and a maximum distance of @xmath93lyr .",
    "we find evidence of keplerian velocity distribution in the 2d response function of .",
    "it is marginally possible to explain the results using two separate gas components : one with a virial velocity distribution , and one with a motion consistent with a free fall .",
    "this requires a black - hole mass of a few @xmath1m@xmath2 . in both lines",
    ", we find evidence that the emission medium is optically thin .",
    "we suggest however that a completely different explanation might be preferred : the high , blue - shifted velocities are the result of entrainment of the surrounding gas by the jet , and correspond therefore to outflowing gas . in this picture , the gas is collisionally excited as it is heated by the infrared radiation from the jet .",
    "this readily explains the importance of this component in  compared to .",
    "an unanswered question is the relationship between the seyfert ( i.e. , blue - bump ) and blazar ( emission from the jet ) components in c. the correlation at large lag between the ultraviolet continuum and the blue - shifted line component might just be a statistical fluke , or might be the signature of a disk - jet interaction .",
