    "if the charm quark is sufficiently heavy , then lattice nrqcd is an efficient computational method for obtaining the spectrum of mesons with a single charm quark .",
    "recent studies of the s and p - wave meson spectrum have determined the contributions from first , second and third order in the inverse charm mass expansion.@xcite second and third order contributions were found to be statistically insignificant for the p - wave mesons , but the s - wave spin splittings ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) acquire substantial corrections at both second and third order .",
    "it is difficult to make a firm statement about convergence of the expansion from these findings alone .    in the present work ,",
    "the existing results are compared to a new study , where the nrqcd charm quark is replaced by a relativistic charm quark using a d234 fermion action.@xcite the new simulations use the same set of gauge field configurations and the same light antiquark propagators as were used in ref .",
    "@xcite , so the only differences are the heavy quark action ( nrqcd versus d234 ) and the operators used to create or destroy the various meson states .",
    "the s - wave masses have been discussed many times in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , but the p - waves have only recently been extracted from lattice data : the limit of an infinitely heavy quark was studied by michael and peisa@xcite , a subset of the p - wave charmed masses were found by boyle using the clover action ( he also extrapolated to the bottom region)@xcite , and two groups have used nrqcd to study the charmed and bottom meson spectra@xcite .",
    "the gauge fields of ref .",
    "@xcite , also used for the present study , are on @xmath2 anisotropic lattices with @xmath3 .",
    "the gauge action is classically improved by including rectangular plaquettes , and tadpole improved using the mean link in landau gauge .",
    "the coupling is fixed at @xmath4 , and the renormalized anisotropy is found to be @xmath5 .",
    "the light antiquark fields are also taken from ref .",
    "they are derived from a d234 action@xcite which removes leading and next - to - leading classical errors and is tadpole improved .",
    "two hopping parameters ( @xmath6 and 0.24 ) are used , corresponding to `` @xmath7 '' = 0.815(3 ) and 0.517(8 ) .",
    "the physical @xmath8 meson mass leads to @xmath9 fm , and the physical kaon mass implies @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite the heavy quark was described by nrqcd , and new results are presented here where a heavy d234 quark is used with @xmath11 , which is in the vicinity of charm . by interpolating the nrqcd results to this same heavy quark mass , a direct comparison of nrqcd and d234 results can be made",

    "[ fig : scompare ] , lowest order nrqcd    is seen to give smaller hyperfine splittings than d234 . the addition of @xmath20 terms tends to increase the nrqcd results , but @xmath21 contributions are larger in magnitude than the preceding order so the status of the nrqcd expansion for this observable is unclear .    the nrqcd results are shown in physical units in fig .",

    "neither plot gives a compelling defense for a convergent @xmath22 expansion , but convergence is not disproven by such plots either .",
    "the @xmath23 splitting receives insignificant corrections from second and third orders , but corrections to the spin splittings are significant . experimentally the @xmath24 splitting is 104 mev , and therefore agrees with the nrqcd determination , but the spin splittings are @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev . with or without nrqcd ,",
    "the quenched prediction is smaller than experiment .    ref .",
    "@xcite also provides results for the bottom mesons , and finds that the s - wave bottom masses are completely dominated by leading order in nrqcd so convergence is not disputed . as for charm , the spin splittings are smaller than experiment .",
    "in ref .  @xcite , nonleading corrections to p - wave heavy - light masses were found to be insignificant for both bottom and charm mesons .",
    "this leads one to expect agreement between d234 and nrqcd determinations of these p - wave masses .",
    "[ fig : pcompare ] shows all four of the p - wave masses in lattice units for both of the available light antiquark hopping parameters .",

    "@xcite has been carried over to the present work , and it chooses the best plateau by maximizing the quality factor ,      where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the number of timesteps in the proposed plateau region .",
    "the d234 @xmath27 meson becomes quite noisy at early euclidean times such that no clear plateau is evident , so the method of maximum @xmath31 chooses a `` plateau '' which begins too near the source .",
