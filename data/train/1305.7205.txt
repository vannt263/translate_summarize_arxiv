    "note , quadratic quasilinear interactions can also be handled , but with some extra decay assumptions . here",
    "@xmath3 are smooth functions which we will assume satisfy @xmath4    quasilinear equations of this form have arisen in several models .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough list , but we mention here works related to the superfluid thin - film equation @xcite , modeling ultrashort pulse lasers @xcite , and time dependent density functional theory @xcite . the model we will consider here numerically equates to setting @xmath5 , and hence @xmath6 this is a pseudo - attractive version of the superfluid thin - film equation , which is given by @xmath7 and can be seen as a leading order contribution to the ultrashort pulse laser models from @xcite .",
    "existence of solutions to quasilinear equations have been studied analytically in several cases , see @xcite and many others .",
    "the reason we choose to study is that , while similar to in that it is guaranteed to have small data local well - posedness from @xcite and hence can be used to verify our numerical convergence results for general quasilinear models , the dynamics of can lead to a breakdown of regularity due to a non - positive definite conserved energy .",
    "the model on the other hand has a positive energy quantity and , as a result , much more stable dynamics .",
    "the nonlinear flow will allow interesting singularities to form in the evolution for large enough initial data .",
    "in particular , we observe blow - up at a particular amplitude threshold , but these singularities are representative of a breakdown of regularity in the higher derivatives and hence not the standard self - similar style blow - up from the semilinear schrdinger equation . such a threshold was observed as an obstruction to local well - posedness using nash - moser type arguments in @xcite .",
    "we show analytically that this mechanism for instability is inherited by the strang splitting scheme through a rigorous convergence result and analysis of a finite frequency approximation .",
    "moreover , we observe numerically that this threshold for ill - posedness arises in several different types of initial configuration and is rather robust .",
    "however , we note that this threshold is not the numerically observed sharp threshold for long - time well - posedness , as indeed the dynamics are able to drive nearby solutions to this critical amplitude . these features of will be explored in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear part of the equation @xmath8 taking the complex conjugate , we have @xmath9 we calculate @xmath10 and hence under the evolution the amplitude is conserved .",
    "this will be a key property used to develop the numerical scheme .    to construct a stable numerical scheme",
    ", we consider a strang splitting method for the quasilinear schrdinger equation , which is a composition of the exact flows of the differential equations @xmath11 and @xmath12 more concretely , we approximate @xmath13 with @xmath14 for a step size @xmath15 by @xmath16 via @xmath17 we note that the scheme is explicit and symmetric , thanks to the amplitude preserving property of .",
    "one can use a fourier pseudo - spectral method for the spatial discretization , and hence the flow @xmath18 can be efficiently calculated using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and the flow amounts to changing the phase of the solution on each mesh point . while the pseudospectral numerical flow turns out to be stable , we note that there is a definite loss of derivatives associated with the nonlinear flow component in the middle step of the continuous strang splitting algorithm .",
    "this makes iteration of the approximation a challenge without taking smooth initial conditions .",
    "however , modifying the flow to take into account the pseudo - spectral frequency cut - off will allow us to do frequency cut - off dependent estimates .    due to the advantage of being structure - preserving , the strang splitting scheme @xcite and higher order splitting schemes ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "have been widely applied to a variety of nonlinear schrdinger equations , mainly semilinear schrdinger equations , modeling monochromatic light in nonlinear optics , bose - einstein condensates , as well as envelope solutions for surface wave trains in fluids . see for example @xcite .",
    "while we focus on the strang splitting scheme for quasilinear schrdinger equations , let us also mention that many other time discretization approaches to solve non - linear evolution equations have been developed , including crank - nicholson type schemes ( see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite and @xcite for applications in studying numerical blow - ups and nonlinear scattering ) , magnus expansion approaches ( @xcite and also the recent review article @xcite ) , exponential time - differencing schemes ( see e.g. @xcite ) , implicit - explicit methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the comparison study in @xcite , and many others .",
    "the convergence of splitting schemes for semilinear schrdinger equations was analyzed in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the previous works to the quasilinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we will prove the convergence of the time - splitting method to the original evolution for the superfluid thin - film equation by first proving convergence to a mollified flow , then using convergence of the mollified flow to full continous quasi - linear problem .",
    "the analysis follows the ideas in the seminal contribution by lubich in @xcite , where the main tools are the calculus of lie derivatives .",
    "however , we can not really treat even our mollified problem as fully semi - linear since the mollified equation estimates as a semi - linear problem introduce losses that depend upon the choice of frequency cut - off that we wish to avoid for the sakes of uniform estimates .",
    "we will emphasize on the regularity of the time flow , for which the behavior of the quasilinear schrdinger equation is different from the semilinear ones .",
    "this is a lie theoretic approach to the continuous time approximation and sobolev - based well - posedness results of the second author with j. metcalfe and d. tataru in order to model small initial data solutions of finite time intervals @xcite .",
    "the scheme is symplectic and is stable within a range of parameters , motivated by the analysis in @xcite , where the analysis is done purely in sobolev spaces @xmath19 for @xmath20 sufficiently large .",
    "in addition , the strang splitting method converges in the order @xmath21 for time step @xmath22 .    moreover , we are able to extend a linear instability observed in a quasilinear schrdinger equation in @xcite to the numerical scheme used to approximate it , justifying the accuracy of a numerically observed blow - up .",
    "we study the dynamics of this blow - up solution using both gaussian and plane - wave configurations of initial data to observe that the threshold for instability is not the sharp global well - posedness threshold for the equation and can indeed be reached through frequency dynamics on lower - amplitude solutions .",
    "this is not the standard blow - up through re - scaling of a nonlinear state , but is a frequency instability of sorts that causes high frequencies to grow exponentially in a method akin to a backwards heat map .",
    "the result is laid out as follows .",
    "we begin with a numerical study of the modified superfluid film equation in @xmath23 using the strang splitting scheme . to analyze the convergence of the scheme",
    ", we discuss the mollification argument and prove the convergence of the mollified numerical scheme to the mollified flow for small data in section [ sec : lie ] by using lie theoretic results and necessary multilinear estimates . to understand the blow - up behavior observed for large enough data , we analyze the stability and instability of the scheme in section  [ sec : stab ] . in section [ sec : reg ] , we discuss the regularity of the time flow of the quasilinear schrdinger equation and the time - splitting scheme . in @xcite an @xmath24 threshold for local well - posedness",
    "was observed through use of frchet derivatives in a nash - moser scheme .",
    "we will show this similarly arises in analysis about exact plane - wave solutions on the torus using analysis similar to that of @xcite . in order to establish the differentiability of the numerical solution with respect to time to sufficiently high accuracy",
    ", we rely on bounds in a much stronger topology in space . finally , we tie together the numerical scheme and full quasilinear flow by addressing the convergence of mollified quasilinear equations to the full quasilinear flow in section [ sec : mollify ] .",
    "to test the strang splitting scheme for quasilinear schrdinger equations and numerically study the regularity breakdown , we consider the modified superfluid thin - film equation ( see and also @xcite ) given by @xmath25 on the domain @xmath26 $ ] with periodic boundary condition .",
    "we have done similar computations for the ultrashort pulse laser equation as described in @xcite , but no further interesting features of the numerical analysis arose , so we do not present them here for clarity of exposition .",
    "let us consider initial conditions given by @xmath27 on the domain @xmath26 $ ] with periodic boundary condition .",
    "here @xmath28 is the width and @xmath29 is the amplitude of the gaussian profile .",
    "we calculate the solution up to time @xmath30 with parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the initial condition . a fourier pseudo - spectral method with @xmath33 spatial grid points is used . to verify the second order accuracy of the time - splitting scheme ,",
    "we choose different numbers of time steps and estimate the error by comparing the numerical solutions to a solution with @xmath34 .",

    ", we set to zero all fourier coefficients with amplitude below a certain threshold @xmath36 times the maximum amplitude of fourier coefficients . in practice , for this example , we find the threshold @xmath37 makes the scheme stable with @xmath38 ( recall that the solution is not stable for @xmath39 without fourier truncation ) .",
    "on the other hand , the filtering might introduce inconsistency to the numerical results .",

    "we increase the amplitude to @xmath40 while keeping @xmath41 .",
    "the numerical solution is calculated up to @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : umax_blowup ] shows @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 for different choices of time step sizes .",
    "the sudden jump and exponential increase of the magnitude of maximum around @xmath45 indicates a numerical `` blow - up '' of the solution .",
    "note that the onset point of the behavior does not depend on the choice of time step size , indicating that this is not due to numerical instability of the time integration .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath46 spatial grid points .",
    "the blow - up behavior persists for further refinement of the spatial discretization .    to investigate more closely",
    "the above observed `` blow - up '' , we study the solution around @xmath47 and the time when the `` blow - up '' occurs .",
    "we plot the absolute value of the solution in figure  [ fig : u_blowup ] .",
    "the numerical simulation indicates that the solution develops a `` focusing peak '' at @xmath47 with amplitude close to @xmath48 .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the solution to the pde becomes unstable for this family of initial conditions when the amplitude reaches around @xmath48 . to further confirm this",
    ", we compare the results for the initial condition with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the solution stays below the amplitude of @xmath48 as in figure  [ fig : noblowup ] .",
    "numerically , no blow - up is observed for @xmath51 .",
    "the instability for large time step size is caused by pollution in the fourier spectrum , but not the intrinsic instability of solutions to the pde .",
    "the only exact solution we are aware of for the superfluid equation is the family of wave trains : @xmath52 this is a solution to provided that @xmath53 since @xmath54 for the solution at any @xmath55 and @xmath44 , the splitting error of the strang splitting scheme vanishes , as the potential commutes with the @xmath56 operator .",
    "we study the instability by adjusting the amplitude @xmath29 of the initial data @xmath57 of the solution .",
    "figure  [ fig : planewave ] shows the simulation results for two solutions with initial conditions given by with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "even though the amplitudes of the two solutions only differ by @xmath60 , the behavior of the numerical solutions are completely different . while the numerical solution for the former is stable and accurate , the local truncation error kicks off instability in the latter case .",
    "this indicates again that @xmath48 is the threshold of instability .",
    "we also study multiple fourier mode solutions to observe if non - local interactions can vary the blow - up profile . hence , given a pseudospectral discretization scheme keeping the first @xmath61 fourier modes , we take initial data of the form @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the blow - up behavior of these solutions become more complicated ; in particular , oscillations begin to factor around the blow - up after an initial exponential growth of the maximum amplitude ( see figure  [ fig : multmodes ] ) .",
    "however , it seems that generically @xmath48 is still a threshold for blow - up .",
    "in this section , we prove the convergence of a modified strang splitting scheme to closely match the pseudospectral scheme used numerically for small data initial conditions . we suppose that the solution @xmath64 to the modified superfluid thin film equation in @xmath65 is in @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and wish to compare to a strang splitting flow defined such that an implicit frequency cut - off occurs at each stage of computation with the quasilinear nonlinearity .",
    "we show that the pseudo - spectral strang splitting is well approximated by a mollified superfluid thin film equation . as the analysis is somewhat dissimilar to that presented in this section related to the numerical algorithm , later in section [ sec : mollify ] , we will compare the evolution of the mollified superfluid thin film equation to .",

    "the importance of analysis of the fully discretized scheme moving forward is quite clear from the necessity of mollifying the strang splitting algorithm here .",
