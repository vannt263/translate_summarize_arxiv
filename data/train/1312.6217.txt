    "recent progress in cosmology and particle physics has eluded scientists for more exact science .",
    "the planck released data with relatively good precision , and the standard model of particle physics has been tested by the discovery of a higgs - like boson with a mass around 126 gev in both the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "our current understanding of the universe is based on the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) model and the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , called the standard cosmological model .",
    "although we might understand most of the observations in the standard cosmological model , dark matter ( dm ) and baryon asymmetry in the universe ( bau ) require new physics beyond the standard ( cosmological ) model .",
    "the dm and the bau have quite appealing scenarios .",
    "dark matter as a thermal relic @xcite is well motivated in the hot big bang model .",
    "dm particles would be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and freeze out below its mass scale in the expanding universe . the observed relic density @xcite",
    "can naturally be explained by the annihilation cross section provided its mass lies in the gev - tev range .",
    "the bau may be explained if three conditions proposed by sakharov @xcite are satisfied , namely baryon number violation , c and cp violation and departure from thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "the most appealing candidate to explain the bau must be leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the lepton asymmetry may arise in the same dimension - five operator relevant to the neutrino mass .",
    "the sphaleron processes convert a part of the lepton number to the baryon number , and an excess of baryons can be explained .    in this paper , we utilize both properties with the additional particle content in the standard model gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "a majorana fermion triplet has three components @xmath1 , and the neutral component is our dm candidate . since other components are in the same set , the @xmath2 is called the triplet dm . in this paper ,",
    "the symbol @xmath2 is also referred to as the dm unless otherwise noted . ]",
    "@xmath2 with a @xmath3 weak charge is considered as a dm candidate with lifetime around @xmath4 . the seesaw mechanism with a heavy triplet scalar ( higgs triplet ) @xmath5",
    "is employed to generate the neutrino mass @xcite and the lepton asymmetry @xcite by lepton number violating interaction at the mass scale of @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the standard two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) as a low energy effective theory .",
    "if our dm candidate is @xmath6- odd , it will couple to @xmath6-odd charged leptons with the higgs triplet .",
    "it can thus decay into three body final states ( two charged leptons and one neutral lepton ) by a @xmath5 exchange . since the dm candidate has a weak charge , dm particles can also annihilate into sm particles .",
    "the time evolution of dm number is governed by ( co)annihilations in the expanding universe , and its mass @xmath7 tev@xmath8 is constrained by the observed relic density .",
    "the decay process is negligible to the dm number evolution and its lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe , 13.7 gyr @xmath9 within the @xmath10cdm concordance model @xcite , the decay rate with lifetime around @xmath4 is much larger than annihilation rate at present .",
    "we examine whether cosmic ray anomalies in the positron spectrum can be accounted for by dm decay .",
    "the predictions in simple or single channels ( democratic decay , @xmath11 dominant decay , @xmath12 dominant decay ) could fit each experimental result of ams-02 or fermi lat , but are unlikely to fit both experimental results together .",
    "we calibrate our prediction by providing different branching ratios into each channel .",
    "this method allows us to fit ams-02 and fermi lat measurements simultaneously .",
    "there are several models to accommodate the decaying dark matter to account for the cosmic ray anomalies , dark matter in grand unification models @xcite , sterile neutrino dark matter @xcite , gravitino dark matter @xcite , goldstino dark matter @xcite and instanton - mediated dark matter @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we propose a model with a triplet fermion .",
    "the seesaw mechanism and the standard 2hdm are employed . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the time evolution of the dm number density in the expanding universe . in sec .",
    "iv , the cosmic ray anomalies in the positron spectrum are interpreted by dm decay .",
    "finally , our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "v. in appendix , baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis is studied within this model .",
    "our @xmath6-odd dm candidate @xmath2 is completely stable in the sm .",
    "the only interaction is an annihilation into sm particles through the operator @xmath13 . however ,",
    "if we mind the seesaw mechanism with at least a heavy higgs triplet @xmath5 for tiny neutrino mass , the dm candidate can have additional interactions in the standard 2hdm ( @xmath6 symmetric 2hdm ) .",
    "the standard 2hdm was built to avoid potentially large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) with @xmath6 symmetry @xcite , that is @xmath14 , @xmath15 and one higgs doublet @xmath16 are @xmath6-odd , and @xmath17 and the other higgs doublet @xmath18 are @xmath6-even .",
    "our @xmath6-odd dm candidate @xmath2 is thus allowed to couple to @xmath6-odd charged leptons with the higgs triplet @xmath5 .",
    "it can thus decay into three body final states by a @xmath5 exchange .",
    "the relevant potential which can describe interactions with new particles is given by @xmath19 where flavor indices are suppressed .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 stands for the left - handed lepton doublet , and the components of higgs doublets are @xmath21 with gauge charge @xmath22 in the gauge group @xmath23 .",
    "the fermion triplet @xmath24 and the higgs triplet @xmath25 were expressed in bilinear form , @xmath26 the second term describes the lepton number violating interaction by one unit @xmath27 .",
    "the third term does the lepton number violating interaction by two units @xmath28 .",
    "the rest of the terms are scalar cubic potentials .    in the low energy",
    "effective theory , the heavy scalar triplet is decoupled .",
    "it can be integrated out , and this handling gives rise to a sub - ev majorana mass of neutrinos as required by oscillation experiments .",
    "the tiny neutrino mass can be generated by the combination of @xmath29 and higgs cubic potentials , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of higgs triplet , and @xmath32 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath33 .",
    "this form is reduced to the usual standard form with @xmath34 gev for @xmath35 .",
    "the strongest upper limit on the mass of neutrinos comes from cosmology .",
    "the summed mass of the three neutrinos must be less than 0.23 ev @xcite from the analysis of cosmological data such as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "on the other hand , there exists at least one neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass of at least 0.04 ev @xcite from atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the mass scale of @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath36 gev , depending on the couplings @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the lepton asymmetry may arise in the lepton number violating operators relevant to the neutrino mass @xmath28 and dm decay @xmath40 .",
    "the details of lepton asymmetry in this model are studied in appendix .",
    "in the expanding universe , the number density of dms would decrease as long as the temperature remains higher than the dm mass .",
    "when the temperature dropped below the dm mass , the number density of dms would drop exponentially ( boltzmann suppression ) .",
    "if equilibrium was maintained until today , there would be very few dms left , but the dm number density would freeze out at some point and a substantial number of dms would be left today",
    ". detailed evolution of the boltzmann equation is necessary for an accurate prediction . in our model ,",
    "the dm can decay and annihilate .",
    "the time evolution boltzmann equation of dm number density is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the inverse temperature with dm mass @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the ( equilibrium ) number density in units of entropy density @xmath45 @xmath46 is the hubble parameter , @xmath47 is the dm decay rate ( width ) and @xmath48 is the effective annihilation cross section .",
    "we defined the @xmath49 notation as @xmath50 with the effective relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath51 which is constant in the adiabatic expansion universe .",
    "if we consider only the decay part of the boltzmann equation after freeze - out , dm particles are approximately decreasing with the rate @xmath52 in number .",
    "otherwise , they are decreasing with the rate @xmath53 in number for annihilation .",
    "the decreasing rate by annihilation @xmath54 @xmath55 is much larger than the one by decay @xmath56 .",
    "for example , the decreasing rate will be @xmath57 by decay and @xmath58 by annihilation in the present day universe @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the difference must be much larger at freeze - out .",
    "the annihilation dominantly contributes to the time evolution of the dm number density .",
    "we thus neglect the contribution of dm decay to the time evolution boltzmann equation .",
    "these small decreasings must be negligible to other astrophysical and cosmological observations as well .",
    "the triplet dm has three components @xmath61 , and each component must have the similar thermal history and be nearly degenerate .",
    "we need include coannihilation effects in the calculation of the relic density .",
    "the coannihilation effects can be described in the effective cross section @xcite with the following form @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 with @xmath66 internal degrees of freedom of dm components and @xmath67 is the cross section between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "four processes are related to the calculation of the effective cross section , @xmath70 annihilations .",
    "the mass difference between our dm components are @xmath71 mev @xcite .",
    "for such small mass difference , @xmath72 are negligible .",
    "the effective cross section @xmath73 becomes the average of all relevant cross sections in this case , and we get the effective annihilation cross section @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the weak fine structure constant . from the boltzmann equation ( 3 ) with the relation @xmath76 ,",
    "the dm relic density @xmath77 can be , according to the study of wino dm in @xcite and minimal dm in @xcite for annihilations through the operator @xmath13 , explained with dm mass around 2.7 tev .",
    "the dm decay and annihilation into sm particles in the universe would contribute to the observed cosmic rays .",
    "the decay rate @xmath78 is larger than the annihilation rate @xmath79 at present .",
    "the contribution of dm decay to the cosmic rays are considered .",
    "the dm can decay into three body final states through the lepton number violating interaction , and we get interested in the decay mode @xmath80 where @xmath81 are flavor indices as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the decay rate results in @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the scattering amplitude for this decay process and the angle bracket means averaging over initial spins and summing over final spins .",
    "all the final states are assumed to be massless .",
    "notice that the maximum energy which a produced particle can have is @xmath84 .",
    "the dm lifetime is @xmath85 as far as yukawa couplings are not seriously fine - tuned , the lifetime is of the order of @xmath4 for higgs triplet mass around @xmath86 gev .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    recently , the cosmic ray anomalies more clearly appeared in the positron spectrum .",
    "the ams-02 @xcite has observed a steep rise of the positron fraction over the theoretical expectation up to 350 gev in kinetic energy , and the pamela @xcite made new measurements with a steep rise that extend the previous measurements @xcite up to 300 gev .",
    "the ams-02 data show much higher precision and wider energy extension .",
    "their results must be consistent in their systematic errors , however the spectrum of ams-02 tends to be softer .",
    "both results must require additional sources of their origin in the galaxy .",
