    "charmonium spectroscopy has played a crucial role in the understanding of the quark - gluon structure of hadrons and the underlying theory of quantum chronodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the charmonium system is expected to be far less sensitive to the problems associated with relativistic effects and the large value of the strong coupling constant , @xmath8 , than the light quark ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) systems .",
    "formation cross - sections for charmonium states , their masses and widths are also favorable for precision measurements .",
    "the existing experimental data have defined the spin - independent one - gluon exchange part of the @xmath12 interaction quite well , however , the spin dependence of the @xmath12 potential is not very well understood . in particular , the @xmath13 spin  spin , or hyperfine interaction is not well understood , because there is little experimental data to provide the required constraints for theory .",
    "the primary experimental data required for understanding the @xmath12 hyperfine interaction is hyperfine , or spin - singlet / spin - triplet splitting : @xmath14 .    for nearly 20 years",
    ", the only hyperfine splitting known was that for the @xmath15 states of charmonium , @xmath16 very recently , belle , cleo and babar succeeded in identifying @xmath17 , with the rather surprising result that @xmath18 potential model and quenched lattice calculations predicted a larger @xmath19 [ 1 ] .",
    "it is of great importance to find out how the hyperfine interaction manifests itself in @xmath20 states , i.e. , to find @xmath21 . with scalar confinement",
    ", @xmath22 is expected .",
    "it is necessary to determine if this is true .",
    "the c.o.g . of @xmath23 states , @xmath24 ,",
    "is well measured , @xmath24=3525.3@xmath250.1 mev .",
    "what is needed is to identify @xmath26 and make a precision measurement of its mass .",
    "the crystal ball experiment at slac made a search for @xmath27 in 1982 [ 2 ] .",
    "the search was unsuccessful and they reported 95% confidence limits of @xmath28 0.32% in the range @xmath29 mev . the next search for @xmath27",
    "was made by the fermilab experiment e760 [ 3 ] in the reaction @xmath30 .",
    "it was claimed that a statistically significant enhancement was observed and that the data indicated @xmath31 mev .",
    "however , such an enhancement has not been confirmed by the successor fermilab e835 experiment , with significantly higher statistics [ 4,5 ] .",
    "the e835 experiment also searched for @xmath27 in the reaction @xmath32 .",
    "preliminary evidence at the @xmath333@xmath34 significance level has been recently reported with @xmath35 mev [ 5 ] .",
    "no positive evidence has been reported yet by belle and babar collaborations .",
    "it is fair to say that at present there is no convincing experimental evidence for @xmath27 observation .",
    "the above considerations have motivated us to search for @xmath27 in the @xmath36 data taken at cleo with estimated @xmath4 @xmath5 events , in the reaction    @xmath37    we search for this channel : ( a ) without using @xmath38 decays ( inclusive approach , see section 3.1 ) , and ( b ) using six dominant @xmath38 decay modes ( exclusive approach , see section 3.2 ) . in both methods we search for @xmath26 in the mass recoiling against @xmath39 from decay @xmath40 .",
    "this method benefits from the excellent resolution of the cleo calorimeter .",
    "two independent analyses have been performed , and results from the two are consistent .",
    "i will describe one of them in detail , and will later mention the differences between the two analyses .",
    "we use the following selection criteria : @xmath413 , @xmath422 .",
    "the selection of the showers and charged particles are done using the standard cleo quality cuts .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath39 s by requiring that the two photon invariant mass be in the range @xmath43=135@xmath2515 mev , and that the two photons have been succesfully fitted to @xmath44 .",
    "we require that there be only one @xmath39 in the event with a recoil mass in the expected @xmath26 mass range of 3526@xmath2530 mev .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 events are removed by cutting on the recoil mass of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we define hard @xmath49 s , the possible candidates from @xmath50 decays , by @xmath51 mev .",
    "we reject such @xmath49 s which make a @xmath39 or @xmath52 with any other @xmath49 s .",
    "we then require that the energy of hard @xmath49 should be in the range @xmath53=503@xmath2540 mev .",
    "the background in data has been fitted in three ways : ( a ) argus shape , @xmath54)$ ] , ( b ) second  order polynomial shape , ( c ) background shape from monte carlo .",
    "the significance levels are obtained as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the likelihoods of the fits with and without the @xmath27 resonance .",
    "the analysis on the monte carlo samples has been performed .",
    "the event selection criteria applied to the monte carlo samples were identical to those applied to the data .",
    "10,000 signal monte carlo events for the channel @xmath58 were simulated .",
    "the recoil mass distribution against @xmath39 in signal monte carlo , for input @xmath59=0 mev is well fitted with a double gaussian with parameters @xmath60=1.3 mev , @xmath61=3.7 mev , and the fraction of second gaussian was 0.43 .",
    "these parameters , which represent the @xmath39 recoil mass resolution at @xmath26 , are used to fit the signal in the data .",
    "the selection efficiency was about 16% .",
    "we also analyzed a sample of @xmath62 generic @xmath63 monte carlo events ( events containing all measured @xmath63 decays except those via @xmath27 ) in four separate samples , each with approximately the same size ( @xmath64 ) as the data .",
    "the signal monte carlo events were added in to the generic monte carlo .",
    "the study of these monte carlo events yielded good agreement between input and output values for both , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and showed that the analysis is sensitive to @xmath26 production .",
    "figure 1 shows recoil mass distribution against @xmath39 in data .",
    "the results of the fit are : @xmath67 mev , n@xmath68 ) = @xmath69 , significance(@xmath27 ) = 3.3 @xmath34 .",
    "an independent alternative analysis has been done .",
    "the main difference is that in this analysis instead of constraining the energy of the hard photon , the constraint is put in terms of recoil against @xmath70 ( @xmath38 mass ) .",
    "the results are consistent with those shown above .",
    "thus our preliminary cleo results from two inclusive analyses are : + @xmath71 @xmath65=3524.8@xmath250.7(stat)@xmath721(syst ) mev , + @xmath71 @xmath66 = ( 26)@xmath73 , + @xmath71 the significance of @xmath26 detection @xmath74 3 @xmath34 .",
    "estimates of systematic errors in @xmath65 have been made by studying the following : @xmath39 energy scale , background shapes , monte carlo input / output differences , non - resonant background , assumed @xmath26 width , binning effects , cut variations , and finally , the difference in @xmath65 in the two inclusive analyses .",
    "distribution of the recoiling mass against @xmath39 in data ( inclusive analysis ) .",
    "the curves are the results of the fit .",
    "the shape of the signal is assumed as double gaussian , and the shape of the background is assumed as argus shape ( see text ) . ]      six @xmath38 decay modes which have reasonably high pdg04 branching ratios have been studied : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , and @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) .    standard cleo selections are used for showers , tracks , and particle identification .",
    "the total energy  momentum conservation of the event has been required , and the invariant mass of the @xmath82 decay candidates are required to be close to the nominal @xmath82 mass ( within 50 mev ) .",
    "figure 2(upper plot ) shows the @xmath44 recoil mass distribution for the sum of the six exclusive channels .",
    "the fit results are : + @xmath71 @xmath65=3524.4@xmath250.9(stat ) mev , + @xmath71 n@xmath83=15.0@xmath254.2 , + @xmath71 the significance of @xmath26 detection @xmath33  5  @xmath34 .",
    "+ note that the significance is calculated using likelihood differences .",
    "the background estimation by using @xmath38 sidebands(closed circles in figure 2 , lower plot ) , or by using generic monte carlo events(open squares in figure 2 , lower plot ) , yield consistent results .",
    "no estimate of the systematic uncertainty in @xmath65 has been made so far .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath4 @xmath5 from cleo iii and cleo - c to search for @xmath84 production in the reaction @xmath40 , @xmath50 by two methods 1 .",
    "inclusive  which does not use @xmath38 decay modes , 2 .",
    "exclusive  which uses six hadronic decay modes of @xmath38 .",
    "+ in the recoil mass spectrum of @xmath44 , we see an enhancement in both analyses .",
    "+ @xmath71 in the inclusive analysis we obtain    @xmath65=3524.8@xmath250.7(stat)@xmath721(syst ) mev ,    @xmath66 = ( 26)@xmath73 ,    significance of @xmath26 detection @xmath743 @xmath34 .",
