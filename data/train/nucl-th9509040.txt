    "the ( equilibrium ) equation of state is the _ only _ input to the hydrodynamical equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) that relates to properties of the matter under consideration and is thus able to influence the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the final results are uniquely determined once a particular initial condition and a decoupling ( `` freeze  out '' ) hypersurface are specified .    in ultrarelativistic heavy",
    " ion collisions ( @xmath18 agev ) , the central region ( in the center - of - momentum frame ) is essentially free of ( net ) charges , due to the insufficient amount of baryon stopping @xcite , and the charge conservation equations in ( [ eom ] ) do not have to be solved explicitly to describe the fluid evolution in this particular region of space  time .",
    "moreover , the equation of state depends only on a single independent thermodynamical variable , for instance the temperature @xmath19 . from the pressure as a function of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,",
    "one derives the entropy density @xmath21 , and the energy density @xmath22 .    for this particular case , lattice qcd calculations @xcite provide fundamental information on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter .",
    "these calculations @xcite show a rapid increase of the entropy density as a function of temperature , @xmath23 , in a narrow temperature interval @xmath24 mev around a temperature @xmath25 mev , indicating the presence of a transition from hadronic degrees of freedom at low temperatures to quark and gluon degrees of freedom at high temperatures . for a first order phase transition ,",
    "the increase in @xmath26 is actually a discontinuity , and @xmath0 is zero , while for a second or higher order transition the change of the entropy density is continuous , and @xmath0 is finite",

    "we discuss the sensitivity of the structure of hydrodynamic flow to this uncertainty in the equation of state .",

    "@xmath37 the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) features a first order phase transition between the two phases at the phase transition temperature @xmath38 and reduces to the mit bag model equation of state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we vary @xmath0 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , consistent with the uncertainties in present lattice qcd data .",
    "the first study of the sensitivity of hydrodynamic flow on @xmath0 was done in @xcite .",
    "it was found that for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , matter is thermodynamically anomalous in the phase transition region and , consequently , that rarefaction shock waves occur in the one  dimensional expansion @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath43 , matter is thermodynamically normal everywhere and simple rarefaction waves form the hydrodynamically stable solution .",
    "the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , was that , for the particular initial conditions chosen in that work , those structural differences had little effect on the final flow pattern .",
    "this led the authors of @xcite to the conclusion that observables , such as the distribution of outgoing particles , would hardly be affected by the uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "renewed interest in the sensitivity of hydrodynamic flow on the equation of state has arisen as a consequence of the work of refs .",
    "it was demonstrated that a phase transition leads to a so - called @xcite `` softest point '' in the equation of state , defined by a minimum in the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "for the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) with @xmath1 , this point occurs at the phase boundary between mixed and pure quark  gluon matter ( see also section 2 ) .",
    "it was argued @xcite that at this point the comparatively small pressure prevents a fast expansion and cooling of the system .",
    "this leads to a maximum in the lifetime of mixed phase matter as a function of the initial energy density . on this basis",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the resulting enhanced emission of electromagnetic probes from this long - lived mixed phase could serve as a signature for the creation of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic heavy  ion collisions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the suppressed tendency for expansion at the softest point was shown to cause a minimum in the excitation function of the directed transverse collective flow in semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "it was proposed that this minimum would also be a unique signature for the phase transition .",
    "another important observable sensitive to the lifetime of the plasma is pion interferometry @xcite . in the standard `` slowly burning log '' scenario inspired by the small deflagration velocities associated with sharp transitions @xcite",
    "one expects a dramatic difference between `` out'' and `` side''correlations , which could serve as a signal of the phase transition .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the hydrodynamic flow pattern for one  dimensional expansion in greater detail than in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus on the question of the lifetime of different parts of the system as a function of the initial energy density @xmath45 and the width @xmath0 of the transition region . while one  dimensional hydrodynamics is not realistic for a detailed comparison with heavy  ion data , its simplicity allows us to study the influence of the equation of state on the hydrodynamic flow without additional effects originating from more complicated geometries .",
    "we confirm the observation made in @xcite that , for initial energy densities well above or below the softest point of the equation of state , the temperature profiles in the thermodynamically normal case ( @xmath46 ) look indeed similar to those in the thermodynamically anomalous case ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , we demonstrate that the temperature profiles are quite sensitive to a variation of @xmath0 for @xmath45 _ near _ the softest point of the equation of state . in particular , the lifetime of matter with temperatures near @xmath38 decreases rapidly for increasing @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lifetime of matter with temperatures well below @xmath38 remains large and may even grow for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the `` softening '' of the equation of state by the change of degrees of freedom across the transition region .",
    "thus , the detectability of the quark  gluon plasma via enhanced emission of electromagnetic probes may depend sensitively on @xmath0 , while other observables such as flow and correlation functions are expected to remain fairly insensitive to that uncertainty .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review properties of the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) in greater detail and establish the connection to thermodynamically normal or anomalous behaviour .",
    "section 3 presents the expansion solutions as functions of @xmath45 and @xmath0 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the lifetimes of parts of the system having different temperatures .",
    "section 5 concludes this work with a summary of our results .",
    "in this section we discuss the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) and its thermodynamical properties . the entropy density at the phase transition temperature is @xmath48 . with the definition @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "one can write @xcite @xmath51 ^ 3 \\left ( 1 + \\rho^{-1}\\ , \\tanh \\theta(t ) \\right)~,\\ ] ] and subsequently obtains pressure and energy density from @xmath52 the square of the velocity of sound is @xmath53 it is obvious that for @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( or , equivalently , @xmath56 ) the velocity of sound approaches the value for an ultrarelativistic ideal gas , @xmath57 . in the transition region ,",
    "@xmath58 decreases and has a minimum . in the limit @xmath37 , @xmath58 approaches zero at @xmath59 and assumes the ideal gas value elsewhere . in fig .  1 we show the energy density , the pressure , the entropy density , and the square of the velocity of sound as functions of temperature .",
    "note that above @xmath38 , the energy density approaches the stefan  boltzmann value for a quark  gluon gas from above , while the pressure approaches it rather slowly from below .",
    "both phenomena are observed in lattice data @xcite , and are a consequence of general thermodynamical relationships @xcite .    a way to classify the structure of one  dimensional hydrodynamical solutions",
    "@xcite is through the sign of @xmath60 ( an equivalent classifying quantity is the curvature of the poisson adiabat @xcite . ) for the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) we obtain @xmath61~.\\ ] ] matter is called thermodynamically normal if @xmath62 is positive and thermodynamically anomalous if it is negative .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the first case the hydrodynamically stable solution for the one  dimensional expansion of semi - infinite matter is a simple rarefaction wave , while in the latter case it is a rarefaction shock wave .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath0 , the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) features thermodynamically normal as well as thermodynamically anomalous regions , as discussed below .",
    "the hydrodynamical solution for the one  dimensional expansion of semi - infinite matter may thus consist of a sequence of simple waves and shocks .",
    "for the one  dimensional expansion of finite matter , the expansion solution is that for semi - infinite matter as long as the rarefaction waves have not reached the center of symmetry of the system ( usually taken to be the center of the coordinate system , @xmath63 ) .",
    "afterwards , the solution no longer consists only of simple waves and shocks but is more complicated ( see also next section ) .",
    "an analytic solution is so far only known for thermodynamically normal matter with a constant velocity of sound @xcite .    to see where matter described by ( [ eos ] ) becomes thermodynamically anomalous ,",
    "it is advantageous to plot thermodynamic quantities as a function of the energy density , since in the case @xmath1 , the mapping @xmath64 is not one - to - one .",
    "moreover , the beam energy fixes the initial energy density , while the initial temperature is determined only indirectly through the equation of state . in fig .",
    "2 we show the entropy density , the ratio @xmath44 , the velocity of sound ( squared ) , and @xmath65 as functions of @xmath66 . fig .  2 ( b ) serves to elucidate the notion of a `` softest point '' of an equation of state . for @xmath1 , @xmath67 in the hadronic phase . at the phase boundary between hadronic and mixed phase , @xmath68 ( for our choice of @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath44 starts to decrease , since @xmath69 in the mixed phase while @xmath66 increases . at the phase boundary between",
    "mixed and quark  gluon matter , @xmath70 ( for @xmath36 ) , @xmath44 assumes a minimum which is the so - called `` softest point '' @xcite . in the quark ",
    "gluon phase , @xmath44 increases again and reaches the asymptotic value @xmath71 for @xmath72 . for increasing @xmath0 , the softest point",
    "is shifted towards smaller values of @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the equation of state becomes `` less soft '' at that point , i.e. , the minimum value of @xmath44 increases .",
    "on the other hand , there is a `` softening '' at energy densities around @xmath73 .    figs .",
    "2 ( c , d ) show that , for @xmath1 , the velocity of sound and @xmath62 vanish in the mixed phase , @xmath74 .",
    "although matter with a vanishing @xmath62 is not thermodynamically anomalous in a rigorous sense , this nevertheless suffices to produce a rarefaction shock wave in the expansion @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0 being finite , but smaller than a critical value ) . ]",
    "@xmath75 , there are always regions where @xmath62 becomes negative , i.e. , where the equation of state is thermodynamically anomalous , and consequently , where rarefaction shock waves appear in the expansion . for @xmath0 larger than @xmath76 ,",
    "matter is thermodynamically normal everywhere and simple rarefaction waves form the hydrodynamically stable solution .",
    "nevertheless , since the velocity of sound varies appreciably in the transition region , fig .  2 ( c )",
    ", there will be modifications to a simple wave profile calculated with a constant velocity of sound .",
    "note especially in fig .  2 ( d ) that the region where matter becomes thermodynamically anomalous shrinks drastically even for tiny @xmath0 .",
    "to understand this we first expand the velocity of sound squared ( [ cs2 ] ) for small @xmath77 in the vicinity of @xmath59 , @xmath78 note that @xmath79 is _ not _ necessarily small in this limit , i.e. , one _ must not _ expand the hyperbolic tangents in this expression . in accord with figs .  1 ( d ) and 2 ( c ) , @xmath80 is of the order @xmath77 near @xmath38 .",
    "next , we determine the roots of eq .",
    "( [ sigts ] ) to lowest order in the small quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this yields a quadratic equation for @xmath83 with only one physical solution @xmath84 , corresponding to the upper boundary of the region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous .",
    "the lower boundary can not be obtained in our approximation , because @xmath80 is already large in the respective region of energy densities , cf .",
    "2 ( c , d ) .",
    "since @xmath85 is of order unity , an expansion of the hyperbolic tangent in ( [ cs2appr ] ) is indeed not possible . note that @xmath86 \\simeq -1.572\\ , \\delta t / t_c$ ]",
    "thus , matter with temperature @xmath59 is always thermodynamically normal for finite @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we calculate the energy density corresponding to the upper boundary to lowest order , @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "( this is the point where all curves in fig .  1 ( a ) intersect .",
    ") this result is remarkable in several aspects .",
    "first , the fact that @xmath85 is not small leads to a large shift of @xmath89 away from the point @xmath90 _ already to zeroth order in _ @xmath81 .",
    "we checked numerically that first order corrections in @xmath81 do not change the value for @xmath89 appreciably before our approximations break down anyway .",
    "second , this shift is _ negative _ , i.e. , away from @xmath91 which is the upper boundary in the case @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the size of the region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous does not change continuously in the limit @xmath37 , but increases abruptly when going from arbitrarily small @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in this sense ,",
    "the case @xmath92 is very special in that it features an exceptionally large region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous .",
    "in this section the one  dimensional hydrodynamic expansion of a finite slab of matter with ( homogeneously distributed ) initial energy density @xmath45 is investigated with emphasis on the dependence of the flow structure on @xmath45 and @xmath0 . to solve the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eom ] ) in ( 1 + 1)dimensions we employ the relativistic harten  lax  van leer ",
    "einfeldt ( hlle ) algorithm presented in @xcite with a grid spacing of @xmath93 ( @xmath94 being the initial size of the slab ) and a time step width of @xmath95 .",
    "this algorithm was shown @xcite to accurately reproduce hydrodynamic flow profiles for analytically solvable test problems where the equation of state has thermodynamically normal as well as anomalous regions .",
    "in particular , for the choice @xmath96 , the algorithm accurately reproduced the expansion solution for a finite system of size @xmath94 consisting of thermodynamically normal matter with a constant velocity of sound .",
    "( this solution was first provided by landau in purely analytical form @xcite , but can also be easily constructed semi - analytically via the method of characteristics @xcite . )    in the following figs .",

    "time structure of isotherms all states of mixed phase matter have the same temperature @xmath38 , cf .",
    "fig .  1 ( a ) .",
    "in this case , we define the @xmath98isotherm as the set of space  time points where @xmath19 has just infinitesimally dropped below @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "] in three columns corresponding to @xmath99 and @xmath40 .      in fig .",
    "3 we show the expansion solution for an initial energy density @xmath101 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "figs .  3 ( a , d , g )",
    ", this energy density corresponds to the boundary between hadronic and mixed phase matter .",
    "thus , thermodynamically anomalous regions of the equation of state are not reached during the expansion , and the expansion proceeds at first as a simple rarefaction wave .",
    "after this simple wave overlaps with its symmetric counterpart coming from the @xmath102direction , the hydrodynamical solution is identical to that given by landau @xcite .    for @xmath103 , figs .  3 ( b , e , h ) , the expansion seems to proceed rather similar to the previous case . fig .",
    "2 ( d ) shows , however , that around @xmath104 the equation of state has a region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous .",
    "thus , a rarefaction shock wave is bound to form in the expansion . since the anomalous region is confined to a very narrow range about @xmath73 , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( d ) , the shock is weak and difficult to resolve numerically . the best evidence for its existence can be found in fig .",
    "3 ( e ) , in that the slope of the rarefaction wave travelling into the slab is steeper than in the corresponding figs .  3 ( d , f ) where no shock occurs .    for @xmath105 ,",
    "3 ( c , f , i ) , matter is thermodynamically normal everywhere , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( d ) .",
    "consequently , the expansion initially proceeds as a simple rarefaction wave , as for @xmath1 .",
    "for such a wave , the matter velocity with respect to the wave profile equals the velocity of sound @xcite .",
    "thus , the head of the simple wave travels with the velocity of sound @xmath58 into matter which is initially at rest . in the respective range of energy densities , @xmath58 is considerably smaller for @xmath105 than for @xmath1 , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( c ) .",
    "therefore , as can be clearly seen in figs .",
    "3 ( c , f ) , it takes much longer for the simple rarefaction wave to reach the center @xmath63 than in figs .",
    "3 ( a , d ) .",
    "the delayed rarefaction can be also seen comparing figs .  3 ( g ) and ( i )",
    ": it takes about @xmath106 for the system at @xmath63 to cool below @xmath107 and about @xmath108 to cool below @xmath109 , while the corresponding values for @xmath1 are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the reason why there is no @xmath98isotherm in fig .  3 ( h ) and no @xmath98 and @xmath112isotherm in fig .",
    "3 ( i ) can be inferred from fig .  1 ( a ) : as long as the energy density is below @xmath113 , the temperature corresponding to that energy density is smaller for larger @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for @xmath103 , already the initial temperature is below @xmath38 , and for @xmath105 even below @xmath114 , cf .",
    "figs .  3 ( b , c ) . therefore , there simply are no corresponding isotherms in the space  time diagram .",
    "note that the temperature and cm energy density profiles show a minimum at @xmath63 for late times @xmath115 .",
    "as was explained in @xcite , this is essentially a relativistic effect . at finite @xmath116 ,",
    "matter is moving , while due to symmetry it is at rest at @xmath63 . moving matter",
    ", however , experiences relativistic time dilation and is thus less diluted and still hotter at a given time in the cm frame than matter at rest .",
    "of course , the degree of dilation a fluid element experiences is determined by its velocity .",
    "this velocity is , in turn , determined by the `` stiffness '' of the equation of state , i.e. , the ratio of pressure to energy density , since that ratio influences the acceleration of fluid elements .",
    "thus , for the typical energy densities occurring in fig .",
    "3 , matter velocities are smaller for larger values of @xmath0 , since the equation of state is softer , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "this explains why the minimum at @xmath63 ( or the time dilation effect , respectively ) is less pronounced ( and occurs at later times ) in figs .",
    "3 ( c , f ) than for instance in figs .  3 ( a , d ) .      fig .",
    "4 shows the time evolution of temperature and cm energy density , and the isotherms in the space  time diagram for an initial energy density @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath119 . for @xmath1 , figs .  4 ( a , d , g ) , the initial state is thermodynamically anomalous mixed phase matter .",
    "therefore , rarefaction proceeds via a shock wave , in front of which mixed phase matter is at rest .",
    "hadronic matter emerges from the shock in an accelerated state and is subsequently diluted by a simple rarefaction wave @xcite .",
    "note that the shock velocity is quite small , leading to a long lifetime of @xmath120 for mixed phase matter at @xmath63 .",
    "we can understand the value for the lifetime from the expression for the rarefaction shock velocity , eq .",
    "( 70 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reduces , for @xmath121 , to @xmath122 therefore , we expect for @xmath123 a lifetime @xmath124 , in accord with fig.4 ( g ) .    again , the expansion for @xmath103 looks similar , especially the temperature profiles , cf .",
    "figs .  4 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the difference is that now the initial energy density is well above the region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( d ) .",
    "therefore , the expansion has at first to proceed as a simple rarefaction wave , until the energy density has dropped sufficiently to reach that region .",
    "then , a rarefaction shock wave provides further dilution .",
    "this can be most clearly seen in the cm energy density profiles , fig .",
    "the reason why the temperature profiles , fig .  4 ( b ) , do not clearly exhibit this behaviour is that @xmath19 is proportional to a fractional power of @xmath66 , so that the range of high energy densities is not well resolved when plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "a clear indication for this behaviour , however , can be found comparing the space  time diagram fig .",
    "4 ( g ) , where the @xmath112 and @xmath98isotherms coincide , since both temperatures occur at the position of the shock , with fig .  4 ( h ) , where they are well separated due to the simple rarefaction wave preceding the shock . note that this has a drastic influence on the lifetime of matter with @xmath59 .",
    "such matter is thermodynamically normal for finite @xmath0 , as discussed in the context of fig.2 ( d ) , and consequently rapidly diluted by the simple rarefaction wave",
    ". the lifetime drops by more than a factor of 2 as compared to fig .",
    "on the other hand , the lifetime of matter with @xmath125 remains comparable to that in the case @xmath1 , since this temperature occurs on the rarefaction shock front , cf .",
    "4 ( b ) , as was also the case in fig .  4 ( a ) .",
    "we will discuss this phenomenon in more detail in the next section .",
    "for @xmath105 , figs .",
    "4 ( c , f , i ) , matter is thermodynamically normal everywhere and the hydrodynamically stable rarefaction solution is a simple wave ( until it reaches the center @xmath63 and overlaps with its counterpart from the @xmath102region ) . nevertheless , due to the variation of the velocity of sound in the phase transition region , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( c ) , the shape of the simple wave exhibits a `` bump '' faintly resembling a smeared version of the rarefaction shock occurring in the previous two cases .",
    "this bump , however , is moving rapidly in positive @xmath116direction , in contrast to the rarefaction shock in fig .  4 ( b ) , which is approximately stationary , or that in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , which is even slowly moving in @xmath102direction .",
    "this has the effect that the hot parts of the system ( @xmath126 ) cool faster than in the two previous cases .",
    "this can be understood with the help of fig .  2 ( b ) which shows that for the respective energy densities the equation of state is `` stiffer '' for increasing @xmath0 , thus increasing the system s tendency to expand and cool .",
    "on the other hand , the cooler parts ( @xmath127 ) keep their temperature longer for @xmath105 , cf .",
    "also figs .  4 ( g , h , i ) .",
    "the reason is that the equation of state for small energy densities ( low temperatures ) is softer than in the other two cases , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "thus , the acceleration and consequently the matter velocities are smaller , and therefore the rarefaction and cooling take longer .",
    "we finally mention that , since now @xmath128 , the initial temperature increases with @xmath0 , cf .",
    "fig .  1 ( a )",
    ", in contrast to the previous case , fig .  3 .",

    ", this energy density is just above the softest point of the equation of state , i.e. , the phase boundary between mixed and pure quark ",
    "gluon matter , @xmath132 .",
    "consequently , a simple rarefaction wave precedes the rarefaction shock wave travelling into hot quark  gluon matter @xcite .",
    "( the simple rarefaction wave is not visible in fig .  5 ( a ) due to the large time step chosen .",
    ") this has the consequence that matter is pre - accelerated before it enters the shock wave . in conjunction with the equation of state becoming increasingly stiffer for smaller energy densities in the mixed phase , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b )",
    ", this has the further consequence that the cm energy density develops a minimum at @xmath63 for given @xmath115 , cf .",
    "fig .  5 ( d ) , just as in fig .  3",
    "we note that , in agreement with the results of @xcite , the rarefaction shock is almost stationary for an @xmath45 this close to the softest point of the equation of state .",
    "this leads to a ( local ) maximum for the lifetime of matter with @xmath59 at @xmath63 . the particular value in fig .  5 ( g )",
    "can be again understood with the help of the approximate formula ( [ appr ] ) which gives @xmath133 .",
    "the temperature profiles for @xmath103 , fig .  5 ( b ) , look again similar to that of fig .  5 ( a ) , although the shock wave is no longer stationary , but at first advancing in @xmath116direction .",
    "the reason is that the shock strength is smaller than in the previous case ( due to the much narrower region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( d ) ) , which is especially obvious from comparing figs .  5 ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the shock , which is originally directed inwards , is too small to compete with the pre - acceleration of matter in the simple rarefaction wave preceding the shock , resulting in a net outward motion of the shock .",
    "this mechanism is also responsible for the positive shock velocity observed for higher @xmath45 in the cases @xmath1 and @xmath134 , see figs .  6 , 7 below .",
    "for later times , however , just before the high energy density matter in the center is completely consumed , the shock reverses its direction , due to the fact that the energy density ( or pressure ) in the interior has now become too small to keep it driving outwards .",
    "( this effect is also visible in fig .  5 ( a ) . )",
    "the energy density profiles , fig .  5 ( e )",
    ", do not show the minimum at @xmath63 typical for relativistic time dilation of moving matter .",
    "the reason is that in this case the equation of state is soft for the respective energy densities , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "as explained above , this leads to small ( i.e.  non - relativistic ) matter velocities and the absence of an appreciable amount of time dilation .    the expansion for @xmath105 , fig .",
    "5 ( c , f ) resembles the corresponding one in figs .",
    "4 ( c , f ) . in particular , the `` bump '' structure caused by the variation of the velocity of sound is again clearly visible . as in fig .  4",
    ", however , the expansion differs appreciably from the one for @xmath1 and @xmath134 in figs .",
    "5 ( a , b , d , e ) .",
    "the relative time scales of cooling are similar to the previous case @xmath135 , cf.figs .  4 ( g , h , i ) with figs .  5 ( g , h , i ) .",
    "note again the sharp decrease in the lifetime of matter with @xmath59 for @xmath103 as compared to the case @xmath1 , while matter with @xmath136 remains long - lived . for @xmath105 , also the lifetime of matter with temperature @xmath137",
    "is reduced , while matter that is even cooler still lives longer .",
    "6 shows the expansion for an initial energy density @xmath139 .",
    "this case is of interest since for initial energy densities of this order of magnitude a rather peculiar phenomenon occurs in the expansion for an equation of state with @xmath1 .",
    "one observes in figs .",
    "6 ( a , d ) that the rarefaction shock wave is now driven outwards by the pre - acceleration from the simple rarefaction wave , as was already discussed above .",
    "matter behind the shock experiences cooling typical for the landau expansion with a sufficiently stiff equation of state , i.e. , slower matter near the center @xmath63 cools more rapidly than faster matter at larger @xmath63 .",
    "this , however , has the consequence that as soon as the ( comoving ) energy density drops below @xmath73 , or equivalently , the temperature drops below @xmath38 , a second rarefaction shock wave develops that connects hadronic matter in the center with mixed phase matter behind the first shock .",
    "the occurrence of the second shock could have been expected , since matter changes from thermodynamically anomalous in the mixed phase to thermodynamically normal in the hadron phase . to our knowledge",
    "there is now , however , no general mathematical theorem rigorously proving the existence of this second shock , as was the case in the expansion of semi - infinite matter studied in @xcite .",
    "the shock has an interesting further consequence : just as the first shock expells hadronic matter outwards , the second accelerates matter _",
    "inwards_. therefore , there is an accumulation of matter in the center which is consequently _ reheated _ instead of cooled .",
    "this reheating of the center can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "6 ( g ) , where the triangle - shaped isotherm at small @xmath116 and @xmath140 is a _ re - occurrence _ of the @xmath112isotherm caused by reheating .",
    "in addition , also the @xmath141isotherm shows that the central region remains hot over a much longer period of time than for the expansion of matter without a phase transition .",
    "the reheating is considerably smaller for @xmath142 , cf",
    ".  figs .  6 ( b , e , h ) , and basically only discernible from the shape of the @xmath141isotherm .",
    "the reason is , of course , that the region in the equation of state , where matter is thermodynamically anomalous , is much narrower , cf .",
    "fig.2 ( d ) , so that the strength of the second rarefaction shock is smaller and consequently the acceleration of matter towards the center much weaker . for @xmath105",
    "there is no such an effect at all , and the fluid evolution is rather different from the cases @xmath1 and @xmath134 .      finally , we show in fig .  7 the expansion for @xmath144 .",
    "this case is similar to the one studied in fig .  13 in ref.@xcite , although we followed the fluid evolution over a much longer time . here , the acceleration from the simple wave travelling into the quark ",
    "gluon phase is rather large , leading to a shock wave in figs .",
    "7 ( a , b , d , e ) that is rapidly moving outwards . note that now also the temperature profiles for @xmath105 , fig .  7 ( c ) , resemble those in the case @xmath1 , fig .  7 ( a ) ( with the exception of the immediate vicinity of the rarefaction shock ) .",
    "the main reason is that the fluid motion is now dominated by the conversion of the large initial energy density into collective motion , so that the influence of the phase transition region on the structure of the hydrodynamic solution becomes less important .",
    "moreover , as in the cases considered previously , the variation of the velocity of sound in the phase transition region causes a `` bump '' structure that resembles a smeared shock .",
    "the similarity of the temperature profiles in figs .  7 ( a ) and ( c ) led the authors of @xcite to the conclusion that final state observables will not be much influenced by the precise value of @xmath0 .",
    "they reached the same conclusion studying the expansion with an initial entropy density @xmath145 ( fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) which corresponds , for @xmath1 , to an initial energy density @xmath146 . for this case",
    ", the expansion is similar to the one studied here in fig .",
    "that figure shows that the influence of @xmath0 on the expansion is negligible also for such small initial energy densities , confirming the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , however , the profiles are _ rather _ sensitive to the choice of @xmath0 for initial energy densities _ near the softest point of the equation of state_. in particular , the reheating phenomenon of figs .",
    "6 ( a , d , g ) does not occur at all for @xmath105 , cf.figs .",
    "6 ( c , f , i ) .",
    "we discuss the effect on the lifetime of matter with different temperatures in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the lifetimes of parts of the system having different temperatures .",
    "the `` lifetime '' is defined as the time it takes the system to cool below a certain temperature @xmath147 at @xmath63 .",
    "more precisely , the `` lifetime '' is the intercept of the isotherm @xmath148 in the @xmath149plane with the @xmath115axis , i.e. , @xmath150 .",
    "we choose the point @xmath63 to measure this time , since the motion of fluid cells at finite @xmath116 causes a time dilation which leads to a slower cooling when measured in the global cm frame of the system . in case",
    "there is more than one intercept , for instance when there is reheating of the center , fig .",
    "6 ( g ) , we choose the first .",
    "we investigate the lifetime in two different geometries . in subsection 4.1",
    "we study longitudinal expansion for fixed initial `` radius '' @xmath151 of the system . in subsection 4.2",
    "we investigate a more realistic geometry where the initial longitudinal size @xmath151 takes into account the lorentz contraction of the colliding nuclei .",
    "thus , @xmath151 varies with beam energy , and hence with the initial energy density @xmath45 .      in fig .",
    "8 we show the lifetime of parts of the system having temperature @xmath109 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 for the three different @xmath154 , and for an ideal gas equation of state without phase transition and constant velocity of sound @xmath155 as a function of the initial energy density @xmath45 . we measure the lifetime in units of @xmath151 .",
    "for the ideal gas calculation , fig .  8 ( d ) , there is of course no phase transition , and the temperature scale set by @xmath38 is arbitrary .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "8 ( d ) were obtained using @xmath156 .",
    "one observes that for initial energy densities smaller than @xmath157 , the lifetime of matter with temperatures @xmath158 is essentially independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the only exception is that for @xmath1 and @xmath134 the lifetime of matter having @xmath107 and @xmath136 is equal , while that is not the case for @xmath105 .",
    "the reason is obvious from figs .  4 , 5 : in the first two cases the rarefaction shock wave , once it reaches the center , abruptly cools matter to about @xmath159 , thus terminating the existence of matter having @xmath136 as well as @xmath107 simultaneously",
    "this can be clearly seen in the space ",
    "time diagrams figs .  4 , 5 ( g ) and ( h ) . in the case",
    "@xmath160 , rarefaction proceeds via simple waves which are continuous solutions and gradually cool the system , and thus matter with @xmath107 survives longer than hotter matter with @xmath136 .",
    "the second observation is that the lifetime of `` very hot '' parts of the system , i.e. , matter having temperature @xmath161 and @xmath153 , is also comparable for all three values of @xmath0 . these high temperatures occur , of course , only for sufficiently high initial energy densities .",
    "the reason for the similarity in the lifetimes is that a variation of @xmath0 has little effect on the equation of state for high energy densities ( or temperatures ) , cf.fig .  1 .",
    "consequently , also the fluid evolution must be similar for these high temperatures .    for initial energy densities near the softest point of the equation of state and for temperatures around @xmath38",
    ", however , @xmath0 has an appreciable influence on the lifetime .",
    "for instance , one clearly observes in fig .  8 ( a ) that the lifetime of matter with @xmath136 and @xmath162 has a maximum near the softest point , cf",
    ".  fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "this effect was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the context of fig .  5 above .",
    "it has been explained by the existence of a minimum in the velocity of the rarefaction wave travelling into the system , leading to the `` slow burning '' of hot matter also observable in figs .",
    "4 , 5 ( a , d ) .",
    "an alternative explanation was given in @xcite , namely that the small @xmath44ratio at this point reduces the system s tendency to expand .",
    "however , figs .",
    "8 ( b , c ) show that this maximum in the lifetime is rapidly washed out and eventually vanishes for increasing @xmath0 , although the @xmath44ratio still exhibits a minimum , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "this vanishing of the maximum in the lifetime of matter with a particular temperature is essentially explained by a gradual _ reduction _ of the lifetime when increasing @xmath0 : first , the lifetime of matter with @xmath59 is reduced when increasing @xmath0 from @xmath39 to @xmath134 , cf .",
    "figs.8 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "then , that of matter with @xmath136 is reduced when further increasing @xmath0 from @xmath134 to @xmath40 , cf.figs .",
    "8 ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the lifetime of cooler matter with @xmath163 is not appreciably influenced around @xmath164 .    in order to understand this reduction of the lifetime for increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "9 the time evolution of the temperature at @xmath63 for various values of @xmath0 and an initial energy density @xmath165 .",
    "this value is close to the softest point of the equation of state , i.e. , where the above mentioned effects on the lifetime are most drastic . in this representation ,",
    "the rather long lifetime of matter with temperature @xmath59 ( @xmath133 ) for a sharp first order phase transition can be seen in a particularly clear way .",
    "this _ temporal _ temperature profile changes _ smoothly _ with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the _ drastic _",
    "effect on the lifetime of matter with @xmath59 and @xmath136 observed in fig .",
    "8 is readily explained via fig .",
    "9 as follows .",
    "for @xmath1 the temperature stays constant ( and equal to @xmath38 ) over a rather long period of time @xmath166 , due to the small velocity of the rarefaction shock which consumes mixed phase matter and consequently takes a long time to reach the center @xmath63 , cf .",
    "fig .  5 ( a ) .",
    "after that , the temperature drops sharply , cf .  also fig .",
    "5 ( g ) .    for small finite @xmath142 ,",
    "however , the temperature is _ already slowly decreasing with time _ , cf .",
    "also figs .  5 ( b , e ) .",
    "this leads to a much shorter lifetime of matter with the particular temperature @xmath59 , although the system remains obviously rather hot , @xmath167 , for a time span @xmath168 that is only slightly smaller than in the previous case .",
    "this also accounts for the long lifetime of matter with @xmath136 as observed in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) . after that time",
    ", the cooling is again rather drastic due to the rarefaction shock which has then reached the center @xmath63 . for increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the cooling of hot matter becomes faster , which explains why the lifetime of matter with @xmath136 is eventually also appreciably reduced , cf .",
    "fig .  8 ( c ) .",
    "one also notes that the lifetime of matter with @xmath107 is not much influenced when increasing @xmath0 , in accord with our above observation in fig .",
    "on the other hand , matter with even lower temperatures may survive longer .",
    "in general , the more rapid cooling of matter with higher temperatures as well as the delayed cooling of matter with smaller temperatures is well explained by the increasing `` stiffness '' of the equation of state at higher energy densities and its `` softening '' at smaller energy densities for increasing @xmath0 , cf .  fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "an important conclusion to be drawn from figs .  8 and 9",
    "is that for increasing @xmath0 the maximum in the lifetime of matter with temperature around @xmath38 vanishes and that , for @xmath169 , there is no longer any irregularity that can be traced to the rapid variation of thermodynamical quantities in the phase transition region .",
    "in fact , in that case the shapes of the lifetime curves resemble those for the expansion of an ideal gas , cf .  figs .",
    "8 ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "however , the existence of a transition from hadronic to quark and gluon degrees of freedom , the softening of the equation of state induced by that transition , and the resulting delayed expansion causes the lifetimes to be larger by an overall factor @xmath170 , cf .  also fig .",
    "we will discuss possible implications for proposed quark ",
    "plasma signatures in the next section .    the curves in fig .",
    "8 ( d ) could also be calculated analytically employing landau s solution @xcite which gives @xmath171 where @xmath172}\\ , { \\rm d}u~e^{(1+\\beta)u}~i_0\\left(\\beta \\sqrt{u^2-c_s^2 \\alpha^2}\\right)~.\\ ] ] here @xmath173 for @xmath174 and @xmath175 is the fluid rapidity . at @xmath63",

    "8 ( d ) , it is sufficient to note that the integral is always dominated by contributions from the upper boundary . for @xmath178 one may thus use the asymptotic approximation @xmath179 in the integrand and obtains @xmath180 for fixed @xmath19",
    "thus , @xmath181 behaves ( at least asymptotically ) @xmath182 _ independent _ of @xmath183 .",
    "this behaviour is in accord with the one observed in fig .",

    "the first is the scenario employed in @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that half of the available cm energy , @xmath187 , is deposited in a cylinder of height @xmath188 and radius @xmath189 .",
    "thus , @xmath190 .",
    "the initial `` radius '' of the system is therefore @xmath191 with @xmath192 , @xmath193 mev , and @xmath194 fm , this leads to @xmath195 .",
    "10 shows the results of fig .  8 with",
    "the @xmath181scale converted according to this formula .",
    "one observes that the lifetime in units of the radius @xmath189 of the nucleus does not grow as rapidly with the initial energy density as in fig .  8 , due to the fact that the system s initial size is shrinking with the cm  frame lorentz  gamma ( leading to the factor @xmath196 in ( [ ed ] ) )",
    ". this suppression of the lifetime at high @xmath45 has the interesting effect that existing maxima in the lifetime of different temperatures as observed in fig .",

    ", we employ the one  dimensional shock model @xcite .",
    "since we presently consider baryon - free matter only , we model the `` ground state '' of the colliding nuclei as a ( massless ) pion gas at @xmath203 mev , i.e. , with pressure @xmath204 . the energy density @xmath45 of the hot",

    "one has , however , to consider that a single shock is not the hydrodynamically stable solution in thermodynamically anomalous matter @xcite .",

    "9 ) are less sensitive to variations in @xmath0 and even survive longer with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "both phenomena have been explained in terms of the change in the `` stiffness '' of the equation of state when varying @xmath0 . for a fixed initial system size ( independent of @xmath45 ) , increasing @xmath0 eliminates the maxima in the lifetime near the softest point of the equation of state ( see fig .",
    "8 ( c ) ) . on the other hand",
    ", if one accounts for the lorentz contraction of the initial size of the system , then such maxima in the lifetime persist even for finite @xmath0 .",

    "the lifetimes are also much longer ( a factor of @xmath170 ) in case a rapid change in the degrees of freedom occurs .",
    "experimental implications will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this work we have studied the one  dimensional hydrodynamic expansion of a finite system with an equation of state featuring a transition between ( baryon - free ) hadronic matter ( with 3 massless degrees of freedom ) and a quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( with 37 massless degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the system s evolution was studied as a function of its initial energy density @xmath45 ( which was assumed to be homogeneous ) and the width @xmath0 of the phase transition region in the equation of state . for @xmath47 , where @xmath75 , the equation of state has regions where matter becomes thermodynamically anomalous .",
    "thus , rarefaction shock waves appear in the one  dimensional expansion , in contrast to the case @xmath46 , where matter is thermodynamically normal for all energy densities and ( overlapping ) simple waves form the hydrodynamically stable expansion solution .",
    "temperature profiles are not very sensitive to @xmath0 for initial energy densities well above and below the softest point of the equation of state , in agreement with the results of @xcite . variations of @xmath0 have , however , an appreciable influence on the temperature profiles for @xmath45 near the softest point .",
    "in particular , rarefaction shocks are much weaker for finite @xmath0 than in the case @xmath1 and transform into `` bumps '' resembling smeared shocks in the thermodynamically normal case @xmath46 .",
    "the shock strength is much smaller because , as shown via eq .",
    "( [ ecrit ] ) , the region where matter is thermodynamically anomalous shrinks abruptly when @xmath0 becomes finite .",
    "the `` bump '' structures in the thermodynamically normal case appear due to the variation of the velocity of sound in the transition region . in general",
    ", the equation of state at high energy densities becomes increasingly stiffer for increasing @xmath0 , which leads to more rapid expansion and cooling of the hot parts of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "it becomes softer at smaller energy densities and thus the cooler parts of the system expand less rapidly and keep their temperature longer .",
    "the above results were obtained assuming one  dimensional geometry and neglecting the finite ( net ) baryon density in the stopping regime . nevertheless , we consider possible experimental consequences that may apply also in more realistic situations .",
    "the most important consequence from the experimental point of view is that the lifetimes of matter with temperatures near @xmath38 decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath0 , if @xmath45 is in the vicinity of the softest point of the equation of state .",
    "this will have an effect on the electromagnetic signature proposed in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the rate ( per unit volume ) of direct thermal photons with energy @xmath213 emitted from quark ",
    "gluon matter ( at rest ) is given by @xcite @xmath214 for a fixed photon energy of @xmath215 gev , a reduction of the temperature by @xmath216 , as seen in fig .",
    "9 when @xmath0 increases from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , would reduce the number of photons by a factor of @xmath217 ( for @xmath218 mev , @xmath219 ) .",
    "in addition , the rate integrated over space  time will be smaller by an even larger factor , because the space ",
    "time volume of hot matter also shrinks for increasing @xmath0 , cf .  figs .",
    "3  7 ( g , h , i ) .",
    "this makes a direct thermal electromagnetic signal of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma much more difficult to disentangle from background sources . on the other hand , after taking into account the expected lorentz contraction of the initial size of the system , _ all _ lifetimes assume a maximum as a function of @xmath45 at the softest point of the equation of state , cf .",
    "figs .  11 , 12 , independent of @xmath0",
    ". the detection of this feature is , however , complicated by the broadening of this maximum with increasing @xmath0 .    the generic feature that remains",
    "_ independent _ of @xmath0 is that the lifetimes of matter of any temperature are larger by a factor of @xmath170 as compared to the ideal gas case . in this respect , the interferometric signal of such long lifetimes associated with a phase transition to the quark ",
    "gluon plasma @xcite appears to be less sensitive to @xmath0 than hard electromagnetic probes .",
    "finally we comment on the signature proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the excitation function of the directed transverse flow has a minimum generated by the softest point of the equation of state , or in other words , the minimum in the function @xmath44 .",
    "such a minimum still exists even for finite @xmath0 , cf .",
    "fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "however , the intrinsic dynamical mechanism for the decrease of the transverse directed flow was the inertness of the mixed phase that prevented it to expand and deflect spectator matter .",
    "this inertness is weakened at finite @xmath0 and hot matter in the phase transition region expands and cools much more rapidly than in the case of a strong first order phase transition , although still much slower than if there were no transition at all , cf .",
