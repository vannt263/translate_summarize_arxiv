    "in the canonical model , t tauri systems comprise the central star , a rotating disk of gas and dust , a jet or outflow and possibly a residual circumstellar envelope ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in many cases ,",
    "the central star is still accreting material and this process , as well as the mechanisms driving the outflow , are dependent on and influence the properties of the inner disk ( @xmath01 au ) .",
    "several groups ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) have proposed models in which the stellar magnetic field truncates the disk at a few stellar radii .",
    "matter from the disk flows along the field lines and onto the star producing hot spots or rings that can explain observed ultraviolet photometric variability @xcite .    in the last several years",
    ", the technique of long - baseline infrared interferometry has been applied to the study of circumstellar material around young stellar objects .",
    "these observations are sensitive to hot material near the star itself . given the milliarcsecond resolution capability of the current generation of interferometers , these observations can in many cases spatially resolve the emission from the hot ( a few thousand kelvin ) material and are well suited for observations of the inner regions of young stellar objects .",
    "the first young stellar object to be observed using this technique was fu ori @xcite , followed by herbig ae / be stars @xcite and t tauri stars @xcite(hereafter paper 1 ) .",
    "the fu ori results were consistent with accretion disk models , while both the t tauri and herbig star results found characteristic sizes larger than expected from geometrically flat accretion disk models .",
    "more recent observations of herbigs @xcite have found earlier spectral type objects which are consistent with accretion disk predictions .",
    "measurements of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at optical through radio wavelengths probe a range of processes in young stellar objects including the stellar photosphere , accretion onto the star or disk , emission from gas and dust in the disk and emission from the outflow . in many sources , continuum emission from circumstellar or accreting",
    "material adds to the stellar spectrum , decreasing the stellar spectral features in an effect called veiling . for t tauri stars , the veiling in the infrared can very high , indicating substantial excess emission ( see e.g @xcite ) .    in paper 1",
    "we presented observations showing that the infrared emission from the t tauri stars t  tau  n and su  aur is resolved .",
    "the visibilities from t tauri stars can be difficult to model given the substantial stellar component , infrared variability and the possible presence of a significant extended component . in this paper , we present further interferometric observations of the t tauri stars t tau n , su aur , dr tau and ry tau using the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) and infrared photometry from the pomona college 1-meter telescope . in ",

    "for each object , a series of at least five dithered exposures was used to create individual sky images for each field .",
    "the sky background and instrumental noise was subtracted from all the images , and repeat exposures were median combined after shifting to a common astrometric reference frame to remove a majority of the background noise .",

    "if there is a large incoherent component for any of the sources , then our simple geometric fits will underestimate the inclination angle as an incoherent contribution is independent of baseline .",

    "ry tau was classified as a `` variability induced mover '' from hipparcos data and @xcite found a solution in which the possible companion had a minimum separation of 24 mas .",
    "however , the k band speckle interferometry survey of @xcite did not detect a companion for ry tau in the angular range of 01 to 10  and hst archival images of ry tau from wfpc2 show only a single point source . for the incoherent contribution from a companion to account entirely for the measured visibility",
    "the k band flux ratio would be 0.81 to 1.44 ( secondary / primary ) , but this could not account for the change in visibility with baseline length and orientation .",
    "another likely contributor of infrared emission is a circumstellar envelope .",
    "an envelope can be a source of scattered and thermally reprocessed starlight and can also veil emission from the central star and accretion disk ( see e.g. the models of @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , su aur , dr tau and ry tau are all class ii t tauri stars and have visual extinctions @xmath72 2 .",
    "in general , class ii sources are thought to have little or no envelope remaining ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ry tau shows near - infrared co lines in absorption @xcite which @xcite cite as evidence of no substantial envelope for other class ii sources .    to assess the possible presence of emission within the 1  pti fov",
    ", we examined hst archival images from the standard imaging pipeline . for each source , we found wfpc2 images taken with the f814w filter on the planetary camera ccd . no extended emission or",
    "additional sources were apparent in the images , however they are dominated by the central point source .",
    "azimuthal brightness averages were computed for comparison to a star extracted from the psf archive .",
    "the core of ry tau was saturated to such an extent that we were unable to find a matching saturated psf for comparison . although the scatter in the psf averages do not allow a precise comparison , especially in the core , su aur and dr tau are dominated by a central source ( figure [ psf ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the images of class i sources , such as the sample imaged by @xcite which show images dominated by scattered light from circumstellar material hundreds of au in extent .",
    "coronagraphic techniques have revealed some extended emission in ry tau @xcite and su aur @xcite but as detailed in the next section , this emission is unlikely to contribute substantially in the near - infrared .",
    "we have also calculated an example model with a disk and an envelope for ry tau (  [ rytau ] ) .",
    "as the wavelength range used for the sed comparison ranges from 0.365 microns to 3 millimeters , the model sed is sensitive to many model parameters , from the extinction to the outer disk size and mass .",
    "as expected , the infrared visibility is sensitive to only a few model parameters , particularly the inner radius , the inclination angle and the luminosity .",
    "each object is considered separately below , but the general conclusion is that these models , which include the contribution from extended emission , support the simple geometric models in the large value of r@xmath46 found for ry tau and su aur . in part",
    "this is because the models contain incoherent contributions at 2 microns ( here defined as flux from scales greater than 10 mas ) which were less than 6% for all sources , and could still reproduce both the sed and the infrared interferometry observations .",
    "high resolution infrared imaging observations would further constrain the extended emission component of these models .",
    "the k band excess flux from the models is also close to the veiling values used in ",
    "[ model ] , with f@xmath18/f@xmath73 values of 0.4 , 0.74 and 0.68 respectively for su aur , dr tau and ry tau .",
    "the second general conclusion is that emission from gas within r@xmath49 is a significant component of the near - infrared emission if r@xmath46 is large . for our three objects",
    "this is most evident in the ry tau model .",
    "the relative flux of the gas and dust components for ry tau can be seen in figure [ fig : slice ] , which shows a cut through the model image with the inner dust wall facing the observer on the left in the plot . in comparison , for the dr tau model",
    "a smaller r@xmath46 is necessary to match the high visibilities measured at pti and so r@xmath46 and r@xmath54 are similar .",
    "for dr tau , a smaller value of r@xmath54 than estimated from the stellar properties ( 2 r@xmath47 instead of 5 r@xmath47 ) was necessary to match the data .",
    "we have not explored the value of r@xmath54 extensively in these models , so these values should be taken as approximate .",
    "observations by @xcite of co fundamental emission for several single t tauri stars similar to our targets ( e.g. bp tau ) found the inner co radius to be smaller than the calculated corotation radius for 5 out of 6 sources with co inner radii of 0.02 to 0.09 au .",
    "modeling of herbig ae / be sources by @xcite found emission from the inner gas exceeded the stellar emission for accretion rates @xmath74 m@xmath55/yr .    to confirm the effect of the gas emission , a model was constructed for ry tau in which the gas was artificially removed from the region within r@xmath46 , which was set to match the measured pti visibilities .",
    "however , the sed fit for this model ( table [ model : table ] , model ry - d ) is not as good as for the model with gas emission .      for su aur ,",
    "both the sed and the measured visibilities are well fit by model su - a .",
    "figure [ model : plot ] shows the inner region of this model , with the star and the inner dust disk edge producing the k band emission . at an inclination angle of 60  the inner edge of the dust disk facing",
    "the observer is clearly brighter .",
    "we find r@xmath46 = 0.21 au , similar to the inclined ring model radius of 0.18 au from table [ table : fits ] .",
    "the gas emission is visible close to the star ( r@xmath75r@xmath47 ) but the emission is limited by the small surface area at this radius .",
    "recent observations by @xcite have traced extended emission at k out to radii of 26 .",
    "this study did not measure the scattered light within 1  so does not help constrain the pti data , but does suggest that a complete model for su aur would include an extended scattered component ; however , their measured k flux from 1  to 26 was only 4% of the 2mass k flux , so neglecting this component adds only a small error to the sed fit .",
    "it was not possible to fit both the pti data and the sed data well with these models .",
    "the best - fit model listed in table [ model : table ] underestimates the infrared visibility and underestimates the sed throughout the near and mid - infrared ( figure [ fig : sed ] ) . in order to produce an inner disk radius small enough to fit the pti data",
    ", the model must contain no accretion ( model dr - e ) , which drastically underestimates the sed and disagrees with the accretion diagnostics observed for the source @xcite .",
    "the infrared photometry ( table [ irphot : table ] ) does not reveal substantial variations recently , however the optical veiling for dr tau has been highly variable @xcite and as the sed data and pti measurements are not contemporaneous , there may be issues with source variability in our modeling . also note that the models in table [ model : table ] have a lower inclination ( @xmath76 ) than given by the geometric fits ( @xmath77 ) but within the uncertainty .",
    "we compared the photometry from @xcite which are averages of measurements from the literature to the optical and infrared contemporaneous sed from @xcite and the main deviation is slightly lower fluxes at @xmath78 for the contemporaneous sed , which does not improve our model fits . in the variability study by @xcite",
    "dr tau showed no trend in color with brightness changes , suggesting the variability is not due to large extinction changes .",
    "the variability of dr tau has been modeled as a hot spot on the stellar photosphere @xcite , but the models here do not attempt to model dr tau with that level of detail .",
    "ry tau has the largest r@xmath46 of the three sources and gas within r@xmath46 contributes substantially to the infrared emission .",
    "this second component in the disk emission means that the simple ring model is an _ underestimate _ of r@xmath46 .",
    "although this same gas component is present in the models for all three sources , the contribution to the k band flux is largest for ry  tau as r@xmath46 is larger than for the other two sources . for ry tau ,",
    "the best fit model was relatively close to the optimal parameters for both the pti and sed data .",
    "the pti data are best modeled by a higher total luminosity and accretion rate ( model ry - b ) than the sed data .",
    "a reflection nebulosity has been observed extending to @xmath240  from ry  tau at visible wavelengths .",
    "however , this is unlikely to contribute substantially at k as the reflection component is only 2% of the total flux at 0.9 @xmath3 m and scattering decreases with increasing wavelength . to test the effect of an envelope on the predicted visibilities and sed ,",
    "a model was calculated using the disk properties of model ry - a with an envelope using the same gas and dust radii , 0.01 times the disk mass and an infall rate of 1 @xmath79 m@xmath55/yr for the envelope .",
    "as seen in table [ model : table ] , this model does not fit either the sed or the visibilities as well .",
    "other models with higher envelope masses were also calculated and had even worse fits to the sed .",
    "it may be possible to better match the sed with a different disk and envelope combination , however we found no observational evidence for substantial near - infrared emission from an envelope .",
    "we note that @xcite have recently characterized ry tau as a g1 star , substantially earlier than previous spectral type determinations . however , their stellar properties ( r@xmath47 = 2.9 r@xmath55 , m@xmath47 = 2.0 m@xmath55 ) agree reasonably well with the values we used ( table [ table : source ] ) . we used a slightly lower effective temperature ( 5782 k compared to 5945 k ) and a higher luminosity ( 12.8 l@xmath55 compared to 9.6 l@xmath55 ) . a lower stellar luminosity would require a more massive disk and higher accretion to produce the same flux at longer wavelengths , but the general properties of a large r@xmath80 would not change .",
    "the accretion rate of the model presented here , @xmath69 m@xmath55/yr , is actually higher than the @xcite estimate of @xmath81 m@xmath55/yr .",
    "infrared interferometric observations of t  tauri stars are used to constrain the inner disk properties .",
    "detailed models were presented for su aur , ry tau and dr tau to reproduce both the interferometry observations and the spectral energy distribution .",
    "for both the simple geometric fits to the interferometry data and the monte carlo disk models which include accretion and scattering , the inner dust radius ranges from 0.05 to 0.3 au .",
    "extended envelopes were not needed to reproduce the sed for these sources , although additional high resolution infrared images would help in constraining the extended emission on larger scales ( tens to hundreds of au ) . however , the significant variations in the visibility with baseline length and orientation seen for su aur and ry tau require a resolved component to be present as an extended component produces a constant visibility reduction . although the models parameters given here may not be a unique solution to the data set used , they are consistent with the domination of the near - infrared excess by thermal emission from the disk , as expected for class ii sources .",
    "the su aur model agrees well with the size derived from geometric fits to the interferometer data alone .",
    "the sed and pti visibilities for dr tau can not both be fit with these models , perhaps due to source variability . for ry tau , the model predicts significant emission in the k band from gas within the inner dust disk radius .",
    "this gas emission at infrared wavelengths is generally not considered in the simple models used to fit interferometric data and when this emission is present results in an underestimate of the dust radius when using a simple ring model .",
    "future work will extend the observational database to study more sources and probe the innermost regions of disks .",
    "interferometric observations at a second wavelength would add additional constraints on the inner disk structure . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", we are extending the monte carlo codes to include gas opacity in the inner disk and self - consistently calculate its structure .",
    "the data and models presented in this paper clearly show that inner gas disks can not be ignored and are required when fitting observations that probe the inner regions of disks .",
