    "[ scalar-2004 ] that the _ new - type _",

    "nevertheless the dama annual signal modulation is one of a few available _ positive _ signatures of wimp - nucleus interactions and the importance of its observation goes far beyond a `` simple '' background reduction .",
    "therefore , to completely exclude the dama result , a new experiment , being sensitive to the modulation signal , would have to confirm or exclude this modulation signal on the basis of the same or much better statistics .",
    "furthermore , taking seriously the positive dama result together with the negative results of the cdms and edelweiss as well as the results of @xcite one can arrive at a conclusion about simultaneous existence and importance of both sd and si wimp - nucleus interactions .",
    "the accurate calculations of spin nuclear structure @xcite demonstrate that contrary to the simplified odd - group approach both @xmath131 and @xmath132 differ from zero , but nevertheless one of these spin quantities always dominates ( @xmath147 , or @xmath143 ) .",

    "i.e. _ at least _ to detect dark matter particles , one simultaneously needs to apply the front - end knowledge of modern particle physics , astrophysics , cosmology and nuclear physics as well as one should develop , and use over long time extremely high - sensitive experimental setups , and complex data analysis methods .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) nowadays are among the best motivated non - baryonic dark matter candidates . in particular , the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ,",
    "the neutralino , is a very good wimp candidate .",
    "the motivation for supersymmetry arises naturally in modern theories of particle physics .    to estimate the expected direct detection rate for these wimps any susy - like model , for example , an effective low - energy minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( effmssm ) , or some measured data , for example , from the dama experiment @xcite , can be used . on this basis",
    "the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron spin and scalar cross sections at zero - momentum transfer ( @xmath245 and @xmath246 ) can be calculated .",
    "these calculations one usually compares with measurements , which ( with the only exception of the dama result ) are presented in the form of exclusion curves  upper limits of cross section as functions of the wimp mass . in the case of non - observation of any dm signal",
    "an exclusion curve simply reflects the sensitivity of a given direct dm search experiment and potentially allows one to constrain some version of susy - like theory , _ if the curve is sensitive enough_. therefore the best exclusion curve is currently a clear aim of almost all dark matter search experiments ( dama , libra , and genius perhaps are / were the only exceptions ) .",
    "the main competition between the experiments runs in the field of these exclusion curves .    before 2000",
    "all exclusion curves were evaluated mainly in the one - coupling dominance approach ( when only one cross section was defined from the measured spectra for fixed wimp mass ) , which gave slightly pessimistic ( for spin - non - zero target experiments ) , but universal limits for all experiments .",
    "one would say that the competition between dm experiments was honest .",
    "the predictions from susy - like models were in general far from being reached by the data .    mainly after the paper @xcite was published in 2000 ( and as well after the dama evidence @xcite ) a new kind of exclusion curves appeared .",
    "in particular , for the first time these curves were obtained for the spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section limits when non - zero sub - dominant spin wimp - nucleon contributions were taken into account @xcite .",
    "this procedure obviously improved the quality of the exclusion curves .",
    "therefore a direct comparison of an old - fashioned exclusion curve with a new one could in principle mislead one to a wrong conclusion about better sensitivity of the more recent experiments .",
    "there is generally some possible incorrectness in the direct comparison of the exclusion curves for the wimp - proton(neutron ) spin - dependent cross section obtained with and without the non - zero wimp - neutron(proton ) spin - dependent contribution .",
    "furthermore the above - mentioned incorrectness concerns to a great extent the direct comparison of spin - dependent exclusion curves obtained with and without non - zero spin - independent contributions @xcite . taking into account both spin couplings @xmath160 and @xmath159 but ignoring the scalar coupling @xmath60 , one can easily arrive at a misleading conclusion especially for not very light target nuclei when it is not obvious that ( both ) spin couplings dominate over the scalar one . to be consistent , one has to use a mixed spin - scalar coupling approach as for the first time proposed by the dama collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that potentially misleading discrepancies between the results of different dark matter search experiments ( for example , dama vs cdms and edelweiss ) as well as between the data and the susy calculations can be avoided by using the mixed spin - scalar coupling approach , where the spin - independent and spin - dependent wimp - nucleon couplings are a priori considered to be _ both _ non - zero .",
    "the mixed spin - scalar coupling approach was applied to analyze the data from both hdms experiments with natural ge and with the neutron - odd group high - spin isotope @xmath0ge .",
    "the approach allows both upper limits for spin - dependent @xmath247 and spin - independent @xmath248 cross sections of wimp - nucleon interaction to be simultaneously determined from the experimental data . in this way visible improvement in form of exclusion curves is achieved relative to the traditional one - coupling dominance scheme @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the obtained @xmath249 and @xmath248 with parameter regions allowed from the observation of the annual modulation signature by the dama collaboration is demonstrated .",
    "the above - mentioned correlations between @xmath249 and @xmath248 can be considered as a new requirement , which demands that for any fixed wimp mass @xmath59 one should have @xmath239  and @xmath240 , simultaneously , provided @xmath250 are calculated in any underlying susy - like theory .",
    "for the first time a similar result for nai was mentioned by the dama collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , that without proper knowledge of the nuclear and nucleon structure it is not possible to extract reliable and useful information ( at least in form of these @xmath249 and @xmath248 cross sections ) from direct dark matter search experiments .",
    "however , astrophysical uncertainties , in particular the dm distribution in vicinity of the earth @xcite , make the problem of interpretation of results of the dm search experiments far more complicated . at the moment to have a chance to compare sensitivities of different experiments people adopted one common truncated maxwellian dm particle distribution , but nobody can prove its correctness . only in the case of indeed direct dm detection",
    "one can make some conclusions about the real dm particle distribution in the vicinity of the earth .",
    "furthermore , almost by definition ( from the very beginning ) , a modern experiment aiming at the best exclusion curve is doomed to non - observation of the dm signal .",
    "this is due to the fact , that a typical expected dm - signal spectrum exponentially drops with recoil energy and it is practically impossible to single it out from a background non - wimp spectrum of a typical ( semiconductor ) detector , which is as usual exponential as well .",
    "in fact , one needs some clear , or `` positive '' signature of wimp particles interactions with target nuclei .",
    "only exclusion curves are not enough .",
    "ideally this signature should be a unique feature of such an interaction ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "there are some typical characteristics of wimp particle interactions with a nuclear target which can potentially play the role of such positive wimp signatures ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "first of all wimps produce nuclear recoils , while most radioactive backgrounds produce electron recoils .",
    "nevertheless , for example , neutrons ( and any other heavy neutral particle ) also can produce nuclear recoils . there exist also some proposals which rely on wimp detection via electron recoils ( see for example @xcite ) .    due to the extremely rare event rate of the wimp - nuclear interactions ( the mean free path of a wimp in matter is of the order of a light - year ) one can expect two features .",
    "the first one is that the probability of two consecutive interactions in a single detector or two closely located detectors is completely negligible .",
    "multiple interactions of photons , gamma - rays or neutrons under the same conditions are much more common",
    ". therefore only non - multiple interaction events can pretend to be from wimps .",
    "the second one is a uniform distribution of the wimp induced events throughout a detector .",
    "this feature can also be used _ in future _ to identify background events ( from photons , neutrons , beta and alpha particles ) in rather large - volume position - sensitive detectors .",
    "the shape of the wimp - induced recoil energy spectrum can be predicted rather accurately ( for given wimp mass , for fixed nuclear structure functions and astrophysical parameters ) .",
    "the observed energy spectrum , pretending to be from wimps , must be consistent with the expectation . however , this shape is exponential , right as it is the case for many background sources .    obviously , the nuclear - recoil feature , the non - multiple interaction , the uniform event distribution throughout a detector and the shape of the recoil energy spectrum could not be a clear `` positive signature '' of wimp interactions .",
    "one believes that the following three features of wimp - nuclear interaction can serve as a clear `` positive signature '' .",
    "the currently most promising , technically reachable and already used ( by the dama collaboration ) `` positive signature '' is the annual modulation signature . the wimp flux and its average kinetic energy vary annually due to the combined motions of the earth and sun relative to the galactic center .",
    "the impact wimp energy increases ( decreases ) when the earth velocity is added to ( subtracted from ) the velocity of the sun .",
    "the amplitude of the annual modulation depends on many factors  the details of the halo model , mass of the wimp , the year - averaged rate ( or total wimp - nuclear cross sections ) , etc .",
    "in general the expected modulation amplitude is rather small ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) and to observe it one needs huge ( at best ton scale ) detectors which can continuously operate over 57 years .",
    "of course , to reliably use this signature one should prove the absence of annually - modulated backgrounds .",
    "one should , however , also be aware that seasonal modulation can also originate from other scenarios such as caustic rings of axions or neutralinos in the halo dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "another potentially promising positive wimp signature is connected with the possibility to measure the direction of the recoil nuclei induced by a wimp . in these directional recoil experiments",
    "one plans to measure the correlation of the event rate with the sun s motion ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the task is extremely complicated ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the third well - known potentially useful positive wimp signature is connected with the coherence of the wimp - nucleus spin - independent interaction .",
    "due to a rather low momentum transfer a wimp coherently scatters on the whole target nucleus and the elastic cross - section of this interaction should be proportional to @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the atomic number of the target nucleus .",
    "contrary to the @xmath253-behavior , the cross - section of neutron scattering on nuclei ( due to the strong nature of this interaction ) is proportional to the geometrical cross - section of the target nucleus ( @xmath254-dependence ) . to reliably use this @xmath253-signature",
    "one has to satisfy at least two conditions .",
    "first , one should be sure that the spin - independent wimp - nuclear interaction indeed dominates over the relevant spin - dependent interaction .",
    "this is far from being obvious ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "second , one should , at least , for two targets with different atomic number @xmath252 rather accurately measure the recoil spectra ( in the worst case integrated event rates ) under the same background conditions .",
    "currently this goal looks far from being realizable .",
    "developing further the idea of this third signature , one can also consider as a possible extra wimp - signature an observation of the similarity ( or coherent behavior ) of measured spectra at different ( also non - zero spin ) nuclear targets .",
    "this possibility relies on rather accurate spin structure functions for the experimentally interesting nuclei ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "also in the case of currently very promising event - by - event active background reduction techniques ( like in the cdms and edelweiss experiments ) one inevitably needs clear positive wimp signature(s ) . without these signatures",
    "one hardly can convince anyone that the final spectrum is saturated only by wimps .",
    "furthermore with the help of these extra signatures one can define the wimp mass from the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is known ( see for example the discussion in @xcite and earlier partly in @xcite ) that a proof of the observation of a dark matter signal is an extremely complicated problem . as pointed out above , on this way",
    "an interpretation of measurements in the form of exclusion curves helps almost nothing . of course , an exclusion curve is at least something from nothing observed .",
    "it allows sensitivity comparison of different experiments and therefore allows to decide who at the moment is the best excluder. but , for example , supersymmetric theory is , in general , very flexible , it has a lot of parameters , and one hardly believes that an exclusion curve can ever impose any decisive constraint on it .",
    "the situation is much worse due to the already mentioned famous nuclear and astrophysical uncertainties involved in the exclusion curves evaluation @xcite .",
    "this is why , from our point of view , it is not very decisive ( or wise ) to use very refined data and methods ( nuclear , astrophysical , numerical , statistical @xcite , etc ) and spend big resources fighting only for the best exclusion curve .",
    "this fighting could be only accepted , perhaps , in the case when one tries to strongly improve the sensitivity of a small detector having future plans to use many copies of it in a huge detector array with a total ton - scale mass .    as it already has been stressed in @xcite , in case of a positive dm signal",
    ", e.g. the detector hdms has no means to discriminate the signal from background . with a target mass of 200 g",
    "only , the statistical accuracy within 2 years of measurements is too low in order to see the annual modulation , which is nowadays the only available positive signature of wimp interaction with terrestrial matter .",
    "the same is completely true for any other potentially very accurate low - target - mass direct dark matter search experiment . to have a chance to see the annual modulation signature of wimp - nuclear interaction and to detect dark matter particles , as seems to have been done by dama ,",
    "one preferably needs either a genius - like huge setup @xcite which was planned to operate up to 1000 kg of hpge detectors of different enrichment of @xmath255ge and @xmath0ge ( in a large volume of ultra - pure liquid nitrogen ) , or , perhaps , a setup with a bit smaller mass , which is able to perform permanent data taking over at least several years under extremely low background conditions ( like for example , the genius - tf experiment @xcite , or a future enlarged edelweiss setup ) .",
    "the performing of such experiment seems , however , more difficult than originally expected @xcite .",
    "in this review paper the following main questions have been discussed .",
    "_ why do we want to improve the exclusion curves ? _",
    "the answer usually is : to constrain a susy - like theory .",
    "unfortunately this is an almost hopeless aim due to the huge flexibility of such theories and the inevitable necessity of extra information from other susy - sensitive observables ( for example , from lhc , or tevatron ) .",
    "almost all experimental groups presenting their exclusion curves try to compare them with some susy predictions .",
    "it is clear from this comparison ( see for example , fig .",
    "[ scalar-2004 ] ) that there are some domains of the susy parameter space , which are excluded already now by these exclusion curves .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is that nobody yet has seriously considered  or used otherwise  these constraints for susy . in short , at the present and foreseeable level of experimental accuracy , simple fighting for the best exclusion curve is almost useless , either for real dm detection , or for substantial restrictions for susy .    _ how far one can improve an exclusion curve ? _ it is almost a question of taste , when one should decide to stop speculations on the improvement of the exclusion curve .",
    "almost always one can find something to improve the exclusion curve .",
    "_ what one would like to see in the future beyond an exclusion curve ? _",
    "new generations of dark matter experiments right from their beginning _ should aim at detection _ of dark matter particles .",
    "this will require development of new setups , which will be able to register _ positive signatures _ of the dark matter particles interactions with nuclear targets .",
    "at least the dama @xcite and libra @xcite experiments are seen on the way . in order to",
    "be convincing , an eventual wimp signal should combine more than one of these positive wimp signatures @xcite .",
    "_ why one should try to obtain a real recoil energy spectrum ? _",
    "the spectrum allows one to look for the annual modulation effect , the only nowadays available positive dark matter signature , which can prove existence of dark matter particle interactions with terrestrial nuclei .",
    "there are also attempts to determine the wimp mass on the basis of measured recoil spectra @xcite .",
    "very accurate off - line investigation of the measured spectrum allows one to single out different non - wimp background sources and to perform controllable background subtractions .",
    "it seems that , at the level of our present knowledge the dark matter problem could not be solved independently from other related problems ( proof of susy , astrophysical dark matter properties , etc ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the huge complexity ( technical , physical , astrophysical , necessity for positive signatures , etc ) to solve the problem of dark matter one should not be afraid , but openly use a reliable model - dependent framework  for example the framework of susy , where the same lsp neutralino should be seen coherently or lead to effects in all available experiments ( direct and indirect dm searches , rare decays , high - energy searches at lhc , etc ) .",
    "only if such susy framework leads to a specific and decisive positive wimp signature , this could mean a proof of susy and simultaneous solution of the dark matter problem .",
    "it is on the other hand absolutely clear , that susy although in contrast to others being prefered , since requested by higher particle physics theories , such as superstrings , is not the only candidate for the origin of dark matter , and also other scenarios have to be investigated in a comparably thorough way .",
