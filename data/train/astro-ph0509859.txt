    "emission and absorption features at these wavelengths are also know in galactic sources with strong silicate features and have been attributed to the presence of crystalline silicates .    in order to investigate the presence of a crystalline component to the silicate absorption features in our sample , we infer the silicate optical depth spectrum by dividing out a local continuum from our _ irs _ spectra .",
    "we define the local continuum as a three point spline interpolation of continuum points at 5.6@xmath0 m ( 0.1@xmath0 m shortward of the wavelength range affected by the 6.0@xmath0 m water ice absorption feature ) , 7.1@xmath0 m ( in between the two hydrocarbon absorption bands at 6.90 and 7.25@xmath0 m ) , and the red cut - off of irs ll order 1 ( ranging from 29 to 36@xmath0 m , depending on the redshift of the source ) . for sources without discernable 7.7@xmath0 m pah emission ( e.g. iras08572 + 3915 and irasf001837111 )",
    ", we replace the 7.1@xmath0 m pivot by the continuum at 7.98.0@xmath0 m .",
    "the resulting spline interpolated local continuum is illustrated for iras08572 + 3915 in the lower panel of figure[fig1 ] .",
    "the effect of small changes in the adopted local continuum on the resulting silicate profile is illustrated by the shaded areas around the spline - interpolated continuum in the lower panel of figure[fig1 ] and on the resulting silicate profile in the third panel of figure[fig2 ] .",
    "the resulting optical depth profiles for the twelve sources in our sample have apparent 10@xmath0 m optical depths ranging from 2.1 for iras17068 + 4027 to 4.2 for iras08572 + 3915 , with a mean value of 2.5 ( see figure[fig3 ] and table[tab2 ] ) .    in order to derive the characteristics of these narrow features we have to account for the amorphous silicate features which dominate the absorption structure in this wavelength range .",
    "we have compared the general profile of the 10 and 18@xmath0 m amorphous silicate featues in these ulirgs with those in a sample of galactic background sources @xcite . however , because of the uncertainties in the placement of the continuum for these galactic sources , the derived interstellar 10 and @xmath10 m amorphous silicate features show differences in their relative strengths , and in the level of absorption between them",
    ". since fitting the ulirg data with a composite galactic spectrum would therefore introduce spurious artifacts , we have elected to represent the broad amorphous silicate features in the ulirg and galactic spectra with spline fits .",
    "deviations from these fits in the ulirg spectra , significantly larger than those seen among the galactic sources , would then argue strongly for a crystalline component .",
    "we have tested this procedure on the high signal - to - noise spectrum of the galactic center source gcs3 , and on laboratory absorption spectra of amorphous silicates .",
    "the residuals from the spline fits to these spectra are very small ( @xmath36% ) , validating our analysis to that level .",
    "the method is demonstrated in the top panel of figure[fig2 ] for laboratory spectra of amorphous olivines and pyroxenes @xcite .",
    "the spline fit traces the amorphous profile to better than 2% of the local optical depth , except for the 16@xmath0 m range , where the spline deviates by up to 6% .",
    "the resulting small artifacts are shown at the top of the panel .",
    "we also tested our method on the optical depth profile as seen towards the galactic background source gcs3 @xcite , depicted in the second panel of figure[fig2 ] .",
    "the silicates along this line of sight are thought to be @xmath1199% amorphous in composition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the laboratory profiles , the fit residuals for the gcs3 spectrum are dominated by spectral noise rather than fitting artifacts .",
    "the third panel of figure[fig2 ] shows the fit to the silicate profile of the ulirg iras08572 + 3915 .",
    "the red curve smoothly fits the maximum depth of the broad 18@xmath0 m feature , while ignoring the strong , narrow substructure around 11 , 16 , 19 and 23@xmath0 m . after subtracting the spline - interpolated amorphous component from the optical depth spectrum ,",
    "the features at 11 , 16 , 19 and 23@xmath0 m show up in the fit residual spectrum , clearly above the levels expected for artifacts introduced by the fitting procedure . in the lower panel of figure[fig2 ]",
    "we compare these residuals to known spectra of circumstellar and laboratory crystalline silicates .",
    "the adopted spline fits to the amorphous silicate profiles for the twelve ulirgs in our sample are overplotted in red in figure[fig3 ] , while the residual optical depth spectra are presented in figure[fig4 ] .",
    "the individual spectra in the latter figure are truncated at -0.1 optical depth in order not to be dominated by spurious optical depth structure introduced by emission features of 11.3@xmath0 m pah and 12.8@xmath0 m [ ne ii ] .",
    "these common features aside , the twelve spectra clearly show absorption structure at 16 , 19 and 23@xmath0 m that can not be attributed to observational artifacts ( i.e. fringing , flux calibration ) or imperfections in the spline fit to the amorphous component .",
    "a few sources ( e.g. iras063017934 , iras23129 + 2548 ) further show a weak feature at 2728@xmath0 m and only one source , iras08572 + 3915 , a strong feature at 11@xmath0 m ( see also figure[fig2 ] )",
    ". the latter feature may also be present in the other spectra , but its detection is complicated by the presence of emission from 10.51@xmath0 m [ s iv ] and 11.3@xmath0 m pah in the same wavelength range ( see figure[fig4 ] ) .",
    "further note the presence of absorption bands of gas phase c@xmath1h@xmath1 and hcn at 13.7 and 14.05@xmath0 m in the spectra of several of our ulirgs , most notably iras15250 + 3609 and iras23129 + 2548 .",
    "these bands are otherwise seen in dense , warm molecular clouds surrounding massive galactic protostars @xcite .    in figure[fig5 ]",
    "we show the average residual optical depth spectrum for our twelve sources and compare it to the observed crystalline silicate opacity profile of the young star is tau @xcite and the calculated opacity profile of forsterite @xcite .",
    "the relative strengths of the absorption bands in the ulirg spectra are different from those of the comparison profiles . in the ulirg spectra ,",
    "the features get progressively weaker towards longer wavelength , whereas no such trend exists for the comparison profiles ( see also figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] ) . a possible explanation for this trend could be dilution of the crystalline absorption spectrum by cold dust emission from a less obscured cooler component , either the other nucleus or the circumnuclear environment .",
    "nevertheless , the similarities between the ulirg profile and the comparison profiles in peak position and width are striking .",
    "we therefore conclude that the features observed at 11 , 16 , 19 , 23 and 28@xmath0 m in the ulirg spectra are indeed caused by the presence of crystalline silicates in their nuclear medium .",
    "the peak position of the 16@xmath0 m band , in particular , is sensitive to the mg / fe ratio of olivines @xcite .",
    "the peak position of this band observed in the ulirg spectra ( 16.1@xmath0 m ) falls close to the laboratory measured position of forsterite , the mg - rich end member of the olivines ( mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 ; 16.3@xmath0 m ; * ? ? ? * ) and much to the blue of the peak position in fayalite , the iron - rich end member of the olivines ( fe@xmath1sio@xmath2 ; 17.7@xmath0 m ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , in line with other observations of crystalline silicates in space , extragalactic olivines appear to be extremely mg - rich and fe - poor .",

    "comets also often show evidence for crystalline silicates in their spectra @xcite .",
    "in contrast , while stellar sources of silicate dust inject at least 5% of their silicates in crystalline form , the galactic _ interstellar _ silicate feature is exceedingly smooth , and there is no evidence for a crystalline absorption component in the galactic ism .",
    "this translates into an upper limit on the crystalline fraction in the galactic interstellar medium of 1% @xcite .",
    "this difference in crystallinity between silicates injected and silicates in the ism implies a rapid transformation of crystalline silicates into amorphous silicates in the interstellar medium ( @xmath24yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this transformation has been attributed to energetic processing of the dust by heavy cosmic ray ions @xcite or to ion bombardment in high velocity ( v@xmath111000km / s ) shocks @xcite .",
    "in particular , based upon laboratory experiments and estimated cosmic ray fluxes in our galaxy , the timescale for amorphization is estimated to be only 70 million years @xcite , considerably shorter than the timescale at which ( crystalline ) silicates are injected into the galactic ism ( 4 billion years ; * ? ? ? * )    these same processes  injection of crystalline silicates from stars and cosmic ray and shock amorphization  will play a role in the interstellar media of these ulirgs as well .",
    "possible explanations for the much higher crystalline silicate fraction in these ulirgs as compared to the milky way include a higher fraction of crystalline silicates injected and/or a delay in the interstellar amorphization rate .",
    "in particular , ulirgs are characterized by a high rate of star formation driven by merging events .",
    "in contrast to the local ism , the enrichment of the dusty interstellar medium will be dominated by the rapidly evolving massive stars and the contribution by the more numerous low - mass stars will lag on the timescale associated with the ulirg - merger event ( @xmath25 yr ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evidence for the presence of a large population of evolved massive stars in ulirg nuclei exists for the nearest ulirg , arp220 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies of sources in our galaxy have revealed that massive stars are prominent sources of crystalline silicates during the supergiant phase . in particular , the more extreme examples of this class , such as afgl4106 , nmlcyg and irc+10420 , have crystalline silicate fractions of the order of 0.15 @xcite .",
    "likewise , crystalline silicates have been observed in the ejecta of some lbvs , such as r71 and agcar @xcite .",
    "this episodic mass - loss phase dominates the dust injection by the most massive stars ( m@xmath1150m@xmath7 ) in the galaxy . finally , it is currently unknown how much crystalline silicate dust is injected by supernovae .",
    "indeed it is unknown how much dust is injected by sne .",
    "however , it is conceivable that the sne resulting from this starburst also inject a large fraction of their freshly condensed dust in the form of crystalline silicates .",
    "hence , a starburst may rapidly increase the crystalline silicate fraction in the nuclear region .",
    "of course , the high supernova rate in a starburst will drive strong shock waves into the local environment , which will sputter the dust , returning the atoms from the solid to the gas phase @xcite .",
    "however , likely , the destruction rate of crystalline and amorphous silicates are similar and hence , to first order , this will not affect the crystalline - to - amorphous fraction . more importantly",
    ", supernovae are thought to be the dominant source of cosmic rays and this may increase the rate at which crystalline silicates are transformed into amorphous silicates .",
    "however , cosmic rays freshly accelerated in the supernova remnants may leak away to the rest of the galaxy on a timescale of @xmath2610@xmath27 yr @xcite , limiting the rate of this solid - state conversion in the starburst environment .",
    "thus , the crystalline - to - amorphous conversion time - scale may actually be quite similar to the value calculated for the local milky way ( 70 million years ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that over time , as the merging event ages and the starburst intensity decreases , the fraction of crystalline silicates will decrease on a similar time - scale .",
    "thus , we attribute the high fraction of crystalline silicates in these ulirgs as compared to others to the relative ` youth ' of these systems ; e.g. , the amorphitization process may lag the merger - triggered , star - formation - driven dust injection process .",
    "all 17 ulirgs with @xmath28(10@xmath0m)@xmath112.9 in our ulirg sample of 77 galaxies show crystalline silicate structure in their irs spectra . at lower silicate optical depth",
    ", the number of clear detections falls sharply . above @xmath28(10@xmath0m)=2 , 18 out of 23",
    "ulirgs definitely show the 16@xmath0 m crystalline feature . above @xmath28(10@xmath0m)=1 ,",
    "this is 20 out of 46 and for the entire ulirg sample only 21 out of 77 .",
    "we note that a complete analysis of this fraction is hampered by possible radiative transfer effects in the silicate features ( as evidenced by the strong variation in the ratio of 10to18@xmath0 m peak optical depths ) , the presence of 1618@xmath0 m uir emission in some sources with non - negligible pah emission @xcite and by the challenge to detect weak 16@xmath0 m absorption features at low contrast and low signal - to - noise .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that crystalline silicates are a common component of the nuclear interstellar medium during the strongly obscured evolutionary phase of the ulirg phenomena .",
    "crystalline silicates can also be a sign of high - temperature grain processing . in a ulirg , both a central agn and hot , young stars are potential sources of high - energy photons capable of heating the dust in the ism .",
    "x - ray and far uv photons from a central agn will produce a hot , inner region . however , an agn as the source of grain processing in our ulirg sample is problematic for two reasons .",
    "first , interferometric 10@xmath0 m spectra of the seyfert-2 nucleus of ngc1068 do not show any indication for crystalline silicates in its inner warm  2pc region @xcite .",
    "second , the crystalline silicates are seen in absorption in our spectra , implying that they are located in the cooler , outer regions . this would require a large scale mechanism to transport the inner toroid material outwards and distribute it over the surrounding medium . the extended nature of a starburst does not require such a mechanism and therefore seems a more likely source of processed material than a central source .",
    "crystalline silicates are also a characteristic of the circumstellar planetary disks surrounding young stellar objects such as herbig aebe stars and t - tauri stars . again , in order to be seen in absorption , this material will have to be transported outwards into the surrounding cold medium , presumably through jets and winds @xcite",
    ". there is , however , no indication in galactic sources for such large scale transport of crystalline silicates . on the contrary , for herbig",
    "aebe stars the emission features of crystalline silicates are strongly concentrated towards the inner 2au of the disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we deem high - temperature crystallization of existing amorphous silicate grains unlikely as the source of the high crystalline silicate fraction in ulirgs .",
    "in this work , we report the discovery of crystalline substructure at 11 , 16 , 19 , 23 and 28@xmath0 m in the amorphous silicate features towards twelve deeply obscured ulirg nuclei .",
    "these features indicate the presence of the mineral forsterite ( mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 ) .",
    "previously , crystalline silicates have only been observed in circumstellar environments .",
    "we infer the fraction of crystalline silicates in our sample from the peak optical depths of the 10@xmath0 m amorphous and the 16@xmath0 m crystalline bands and find a crystalline - to - amorphous ratio ranging from 0.07 to 0.15 , with a median value of 0.11 .",
    "these numbers are likely upper limits , since foreground emission and radiative transfer effects will cause the apparent 10@xmath0 m silicate optical depth to be a lower limit to the true optical depth .",
    "the crystalline - to - amorphous ratio in our twelve deeply obscured ulirgs is 715 times larger than the upper limit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the milky way .",
    "this suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates into the ism is short in a merger - driven starburst environment ( eg .",
    ", as compared to the total time to dissipate the gas ) , pointing towards evolved massive stars ( red supergiants , lbvs and type ii supernovae ) as prominent sources of crystalline silicates .",
    "furthermore , the timescale for amorphitization of crystalline silicates , which is known to be fairly rapid in the ism of the milky way ( @xmath2610@xmath29 yr ) , is at most of similar order in starburst environments .",
    "we expect that over time , as the merging event ages and the starburst decreases in intensity , the fraction of crystalline silicates will decrease rapidly .",
    "thus , we attribute the high fraction of crystalline silicates in these ulirgs , as compared to others , to the relative ` youth ' of these systems .",
    "finally , other galaxy types may also exhibit crystalline silicate features far above the upper limits set for the crystalline silicate fraction in the ism of our galaxy ( @xmath31% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the possible detection of a 23@xmath0 m crystalline emission feature in the quasar pg1351 + 640 , reported by @xcite , may be a signpost of more detections to come .",

    "<S> we have studied the infrared spectra of a sample of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies . here , we report the discovery of weak , narrow absorption features at 11 , 16 , 19 , 23 , and 28@xmath0 m , characteristic of crystalline silicates , superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18@xmath0 m due to amorphous silicates in a subset of this sample . </S>",
    "<S> these features betray the presence of forsterite ( mg@xmath1sio@xmath2 ) , the magnesium - rich end member of the olivines . </S>",
    "<S> previously , crystalline silicates have only been observed in circumstellar environments . </S>",
    "<S> the derived fraction of forsterite to amorphous silicates is typically 0.1 in these ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> this is much larger than the upper limit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the milky way , 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates into the ism is short in a merger - driven starburst environment ( e.g. , as compared to the total time to dissipate the gas ) , pointing towards massive stars as a prominent source of crystalline silicates . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , amorphization due to cosmic rays , which is thought to be of prime importance for the local ism , lags in vigorous starburst environments . </S>"
