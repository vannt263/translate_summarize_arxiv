    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) have been recognized as manifestations of a small class of known neutron stars dubbed `` magnetars '' , commonly believed to be powered by the decay of their strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "nearly two decades of observations show that this population of objects rotate slowly in comparison to the classical rotation - powered pulsars , with periods @xmath1212 s , large period derivatives @xmath13@xmath14 , and highly variable x - ray emission .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are notably larger than their rotational energy loss , implying that their powering mechanism can not be rotation but rather magnetic field decay , with surface dipole magnetic fields ( inferred from @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) exceeding the quantum critical value @xmath17  g .",
    "other models have been also proposed to explain magnetars , including accretion from a fallback disk @xcite or quark stars . to date , there are only 26 known magnetarspulsar / magnetar / main.html ] @xcite . despite being a small sample among the known neutron star population , magnetars have attracted wide and growing interest in the last decade , among both the observational and theoretical communities , continually providing us with surprises and unexpected discoveries that are shaping our understanding of the diversity of neutron stars and blurring the distinction between them .",
    "this growing diversity includes , in addition to the magnetars and `` classical '' rotation - powered pulsars , high - b radio pulsars , rotating radio transients , x - ray dim isolated neutron stars , and the central compact objects ( ccos ) , with the latter recently dubbed as `` anti - magnetars '' and showing evidence for a much lower magnetic field ( @xmath1810@xmath1910@xmath20  g ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of recent observations showed that a super - critical dipole magnetic field ( @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 ) is not necessary for neutron stars to display magnetar - like behavior ( e.g. , the discoveries of two low - b magnetars : sgr  0418@xmath245729 and swift  j1822.3@xmath251606 ; * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the discovery of a handful of transient magnetars ( i.e. , previously missing magnetars discovered following an outburst typified by xte  j1810197 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we further point out its low - b magnetar nature .",
    "the previous _ xmm - newton _  observations in 2004 and 2007 did not detect 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317 .",

    "september 25 to 2013",
    "september 27 , and we do not detect the source with either the x - ray telescope or the burst alert telescope .",
    "furthermore , we have not found any optical or infrared counterpart within @xmath136 ( the 1@xmath100 positional uncertainties for 90% of the points sources in the 3xmm catalog ) radius of the source in the digital sky survey-2 , the allwise source catalog , the two micron all sky survey images and all - sky point source catalog , and the glimpse i spring 07 catalog and archive .    the foreground absorption given by the best - fit rcs model , @xmath137 , is consistent with that of snr kes  79   ( 1.541.78 @xmath138 , @xcite ; 1.501.53 @xmath139 , ) , suggesting that 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  is likely located at a distance similar to that of kes  79 .",
    "hence , we adopt a distance @xmath140 of 7.1  kpc toward 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317 , the same as that inferred for kes  79 @xcite , and subsequently parameterize the physical properties with @xmath140/7.1  kpc .",
    "the data show a spectral evolution of the new source .",
    "the average x - ray flux of 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  in the 110 kev band was around @xmath141 in 2008 and decreased to around @xmath142 in 2009 .",
    "the corresponding luminosities are thus inferred to be @xmath143 @xmath144 and @xmath145  @xmath144 , respectively , both of which rule out rotational energy loss ( @xmath146 ) as the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "this is one of the defining properties of magnetars .",
    "along with the variation of the luminosity , the temperature @xmath147 and the x - ray emitting radius @xmath132 in the blackbody scenario decreased as the flux decreased .",
    "the softening of the x - ray emission has been observed in transient magnetars during the outbursts decay ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have thus provided firm evidence for 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  being a new , transient magnetar , namely the slow pulsations , the x - ray luminosity higher than the spin - down power , the x - ray spectra characterized by a blackbody / rcs model that softened as the luminosity decreased , the lack of detection of any optical or infrared counterpart , and non - detection in archival x - ray observations prior to the 2008 september 19 _ xmm - newton _  observation .    with a period of 11.5587126 ( 4 )  s ( at mjd 54728.75 ) , 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  has the second longest period among currently known magnetars ( after axp  1e  1841@xmath25045 with @xmath148  s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the longest period among the nine known transient magnetars . the low dipolar magnetic field @xmath149",
    "g deduced from the period and period derivative suggests that this is the third low - b magnetar discovered so far , joining sgr  0418@xmath245729 and swift  j1822.3@xmath251606 .",
    "given that the source was not detected during the 2007 march 20 _ xmm - newton_observation but clearly detected in the 2008 september 19 observation , we conclude that an outburst likely occurred between these two periods .",
    "it is unclear when the outburst of 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  started prior to the 2008 observation and whether the source was entering the quiescent stage during 2009 . since the spectrum of 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  during the 20082009 observations did not require an additional power - law or hotter blackbody component , as is commonly observed ( although with a few exceptions ) in magnetars in quiescence , including 1e  1841@xmath25045 @xcite and since the source is currently not detected by _",
    "swift _ , the source should remain in the outburst decay phase during the _ xmm - newton _   observations reported here .",
    "indeed , the blackbody component dominates the emssion for a handful of magnetars during the later phases of the outburst decay @xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - detection of 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  in the x - ray observations before 2007 march 20 supports that the source was in quiescent state .",
    "the non - detection of it by _ chandra _  acis - i during 2001 sets the @xmath150 upper limit of the source s count rate to @xmath151 counts@xmath152 ( 110 kev ) , which corresponds to an unabsorbed flux @xmath153 ( assuming @xmath154 and a temperature @xmath155  kev that is similar to that inferred for the low - b magnetar swift  j1822.3@xmath251606 during quiescence ; @xcite ; a lower flux would be obtained if the quiescent temperature is larger ) .",
    "the luminosity of 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  in its quiescent stage is thus roughly estimated to be @xmath156 ( 110  kev ) , which is a factor of over 68 lower than that during 2008 .",
    "this significant flux variation was commonly seen in several other magnetar outbursts .",
    "one explanation of the outburst involves the fast release of the energy in the crust @xcite .",
    "another explanation is given by the untwisting magnetosphere model , which predicts a hot spot forms at the foot - prints of the current - carrying bundle of field lines , and the spot shrinks with the decrease of luminosity and temperature @xcite .",
    "it can interpret the decreased emitting area ( @xmath132 from @xmath130  km to @xmath134  km ) along with the spectral evolution found in this study .",
    "it is well known that a 105 ms x - ray pulsar cxou 185238.6@xmath24004020 @xcite is located at the center of snr  kes  79 , and is identified as an  anti - magnetar \" with a dipole magnetic field @xmath157  g @xcite .",
    "considering the similar @xmath114 inferred for both 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317  and kes  79 , it would be interesting to explore whether cxou 185238.6@xmath24004020 or 3xmm  j185246.6 + 003317   is associated with kes 79 .",
    "note that in both cases the two objects could once be in a binary system or have no relation with each other . given a dynamical age @xmath1587.5 kyr @xcite or a sedov age @xmath159 kyr ( p. zhou et al .",

    ". however , the magnetar has a characteristic age @xmath165  myr , and the low quiescent luminosity ( @xmath166 , assuming @xmath147=0.1 kev ) suggests a large age of the magnetar ( 0.11  myr ) estimated from a magneto - thermal evolution model @xcite , which makes the association rather unlikely .",
