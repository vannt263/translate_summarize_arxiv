    "the use of tfs reduces significantly the sky contamination , an important limitation of broad band surveys , because they cover a small wavelength range , thus increasing the contrast between the emission lines and the continuum , and allowing a moderate 2d coverage in a single pointing depending on the instrument .",

    "osiris is the spanish day one instrument for the gtc 10.4 m telescope . with a field of view of 8.5x8.5 arcminutes and sensitive in the wavelength range from 3650 through 10000 @xmath13 ,",
    "osiris is a multiple purpose instrument for imaging and low - resolution long slit and multiple object spectroscopy ( mos ) .",
    "the main characteristic of osiris is the use of two tfs , one for the blue ( 3700 - 6700 @xmath14 ) , and another for the red ( 6400 - 9600 @xmath14 ) that overlap in wavelength and allow to cover most of the full osiris wavelength range @xcite .",
    "tunable narrow - band filters , also known as fabry - perot filters ( fpfs ) , consist essentially of two glass or quartz parallel plates with flat surfaces enclosing a plane ",
    "parallel plate of air .",
    "the inner surfaces are coated with films of high reflectivity and low absorption .",
    "the general equation for the intensity transmission coefficient of an ideal fpf ( an airy function ) , as a function of wavelength is :    @xmath15^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the transmission coefficient of each coating , @xmath17 is the reflection coefficient , @xmath18 is the plate separation , @xmath19 is the refractive index of the medium in the cavity , usually air with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the angle of incidence .",
    "the instrumental response of an ideal fpf , given by equation 1 , is periodic in wavelength and formed by airy profiles , as show in fig .",
    "1 . see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed theory explanation .",
    "according to the osiris characteristics , the available tf fwhm as function of wavelength span in a range from @xmath228 to @xmath2220 .osiris@xmath23tf@xmath23filter@xmath23widths ]",
    "we can define scanning tunable imaging as taking a set of images of the same fov with the tf tuned at different contiguous wavelengths , which is similar to low resolution mos spectroscopy .",
    "each wavelength is shifted by a certain fraction of the tf fwhm with respect to the others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as part of the preparatory activities for otelo",
    ", we simulate the scanning using a tunable filter with different fwhm of the spectra of several hii galaxies , aimed at selecting the best combination of tunable filter fwhm and sampling .",
    "this combination will allow deblending h@xmath4 from [ nii]@xmath56583 lines with a flux relative error lower than 20@xmath6 ( 5@xmath0 error ) , which is the maximum error for reliable sources and flux emission - line detection according to the project requirements ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the low fwhm of the tf , it will be possible to estimate the object s chemical abundances using the n2 method even for very low metallicity systems .",
    "as a first step , we generated the response of the tf ( an airy function ) , with equation 1 , observing that a difference of at least 3  in fwhm is required for obtaining significant differences in the recovered lines - flux error .",
    "then we perform several tests with fwhms of 6 , 9 , 12 , and 15  . however , according to the characteristics of osiris as explained in sect .",
    "2 , a fwhm of 6  is not available , and a fwhm of 15  gives errors larger than 25@xmath6 for [ nii]/h@xmath4 , which is out of our upper limit error .",
    "therefore , we selected fwhms of 9 and 12 @xmath13 , as shown in fig 2 .    , in solid and dot - dash lines , respectively . ]",
    "we generated synthetic spectra based on data from real hii galaxies , with h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath56583 lines in emission centered on 6563 and 6583  respectively , fwhm(h@xmath4)=4.7  , and [ nii]@xmath56583/h@xmath4=0.43 , which correspond to a maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath24 ) of 215 km / s .",
    "median values of @xmath24 decrease from 300 to 220 to 175 km / s for the sa , sb , and sc types , respectively @xcite , then , our synthetic spectra are representative of spiral galaxies .",
    "we redshifted the spectra to z=0.24 and z=0.4 , the two redshifts of the chosen atmospheric windows of 150 and 180  width , respectively .",
    "the wavelengths at z=0.24 and z=0.4 are of 8138 & 9188  for h@xmath4 , respectively , and of 8163 & 9216  for [ nii]@xmath56583 , respectively . at redshift zero , h@xmath4 and",
    "[ nii]@xmath56583 lines are separated by @xmath2220 . as redshift increases ,",
    "the separation between both lines increases as 1+@xmath25 ( 25  at z=0.24 and 28  at z=0.40 ) , making it easier to deblend h@xmath4 from [ nii ] .",
    "+ the intermediate observed redshift populations at 0.24 and 0.4 are representative of the transition from the relative quiet local universe to the starbursting universe at z@xmath221 .",
    "for instance , galaxies at redshift 0.4 have shown lower metallicity and higher sfr than those of the local universe @xcite .    to add a continuum , we used h@xmath4 ews of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50  , with the ew defined by ew@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the continuum flux density at the h@xmath4 line , and @xmath28 is the h@xmath4 flux of the elg @xcite .",
    "the adopted ews assure the inclusion of several morphologies and types of galaxies @xcite , as shown in table 1 .    finally , to add noise to the spectra , we considered the equation of the signal  to  noise ( @xmath29 ) of a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) , or the @xmath30ccd equation@xmath31 @xcite :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the total number of photons ( signal ) , @xmath34 is the number of pixels under consideration for the @xmath29 calculation , @xmath35 is the total number of photons per pixel from the background or sky , @xmath36 is the total number of dark current electrons per pixel , and @xmath37 is the total number of electrons per pixel resulting from the read out noise .",
    "we can see from equation 2 that if the total noise for a given measurement is dominated by the first noise term , @xmath33 , the equation 2 becomes @xmath38 , which is a measurement of a single poisson behaved value .",
    "therefore , we add a poisson noise to the simulated spectra .",
    "we adopted a @xmath29 of 5 , which ensures the detection of the object within an error of @xmath39 .",
    "the magnitude error of the observed object is @xmath40mag @xmath41 , which means a 0.2 magnitude error for a @xmath29 of 5 .",

    "in this work we generated spectra of typical star forming galaxies with different ews ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50  ) , at redshifts 0.24 and 0.4 , which are the two windows of the otelo survey for the h@xmath4 line .",
    "we convolved those spectra with the tunable filter response of the osiris instrument of fwhm of 12 and 9 , subtracting the continuum , and estimating the relative errors of the recovered h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath56583 fluxes .",
    "we have concluded the following :    * using an airy function with fwhm larger than 15  , the errors of the recovered fluxes are larger than @xmath22 25@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the convolutions were performed using a fwhm of 9 and 12 . * as a result of the convolutions , it was not possible to recover the fwhm of the h@xmath4 or [ nii]@xmath56583 lines , because the fwhm of the airy function is larger than that of those lines . however , if the fwhm of any observed line is larger or of similar size than that of the convolved function ( e.g. , quasars ) , it will be possible to recover the fwhm of the observed line through a deconvolution . in those cases , to estimate the observed flux of the line , all the data  points of the pseudo  spectrum will be used . * the resulting pseudo  spectra show a decrement of the integrated flux at the edges , which is an effect of the limits of the wavelength window that in a real case would correspond to the wavelength limits of the order sorted used . *",
    "the initial wavelength and the sampling interval are of the highest importance , because both will determine how near the airy function will be with respect to the observed emission line .",
    "the estimated flux error of the detected sources will be smaller when the peak of the airy function is close to the peak of the emission line of the source . * the highest difference in wavelength of the pseudo ",
    "spectrum peak ( detected line ) with respect to the observed one , will be half of the sampling interval .",
    "this means that for a sampling of 6  , the redshift error of the pseudo  spectra will be of @xmath42x@xmath43 .",
    "however , a fit to the pseudo  spectrum would reduce the error . * as a result of the convolutions , an airy function with fwhm of 9  allows minimizing contamination by closer lines , but generates large errors when recovering the h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath56583 fluxes . however , the error of the line ratio is smaller than that using a fwhm of 12 .",
    "* an airy function with fwhm of 12  produces smaller errors when recovering the fluxes of the lines .",
    "however , it favours the cross contamination of the fluxes of both lines . also , the error of the line ratio h@xmath4/[nii]@xmath56583 is larger than that using a fwhm of 9  .",
    "* as a result of our simulations , we concluded that the combination of an airy function of fwhm of 12  , sampling every 5 , will allow separating the h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath56583 emission lines with an error lower than 20@xmath6 .",
    "however , in the appendix , the flux error estimates of the emission lines fluxes up to a sampling of 10  are also presented . *",
    "although we selected the combination given above , according to fig .",
    "8 , sampling every 5 , 6 , and 7  , would give acceptable errors in the flux line measurements as well .",
    "* in order to test our method , we selected spectra from four sdss - dr7 galaxies at redshifts 0.24 and 0.4 , and convolved them with an airy function of fwhm of 12  and sampling every 5 , obtaining in all cases errors lower than 20@xmath6 , even in those cases where the [ nii]@xmath56583 line was weak ( e.g. [ nii]/h@xmath4=0.16 ) .    as a result of our simulations we concluded that with the osiris s tf is possible to estimate metallicities using the n2 method in galaxies spanning a wide range of ews and morphological types , to discriminate star forming from agn galaxies , and to estimate the sfr using the h@xmath4 flux . the selected combination of tf fwhm and sampling that will allow deblending h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath56583 lines , and estimating their fluxes with an error lower than 20@xmath6 , is a tf fwhm of 12  and a sampling of 5 .",
