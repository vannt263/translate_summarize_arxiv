    "neutral atoms such as @xmath13he interact via long - range interactions  the familiar van - der - waals interactions .",
    "their origin is well understood ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . owing to quantum mechanical charge fluctuations ,",
    "either atom has a fluctuating dipole moment producing an electric field that the respective other one experiences .",
    "although the averages of the dipole moments are zero , those of the squares are nonzero , as a consequence of which a fluctuation - induced ( van - der - waals ) interaction results .",
    "casimir showed in 1948 that analogous fluctuation - induced interactions occur between macroscopic metallic objects in empty space due to the disturbance of the electromagnetic ground - state energy by these objects @xcite . considering a pair of parallel",
    "grounded metallic plates of surface area @xmath14 at a separation @xmath3 in vacuum , he found that the ( unmeasurable , infinite ) electromagnetic vacuum energy per surface area @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) aquires an ultraviolet finite @xmath3-dependent change @xmath16 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{720}\\,\\frac{\\hbar c}{l}\\,\\frac{1}{l^2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are three - dimensional wavevectors ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two - dimensional and one - dimensional components parallel and perpendicular to the plates , respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions that the electromagnetic fields must satisfy on the plates imply that @xmath20 is quantized , taking the values @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the sum @xmath23 runs over one or two polarizations depending on whether @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the form of the result is easily understood : the factor @xmath26 gives us an energy scale .",
    "thus , dimensional considerations imply that the change of the ground - state energy per area must be of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a pure number , called casimir amplitude .",
    "this amplitude is independent of microscopic details , i.e. , universal .",
    "the associated casimir force per area becomes @xmath29 this force depends on gross features such as the space dimension ( @xmath30 ) , the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves and geometry .",
    "it is tiny unless the separation drops below microns . since in micromechanical and microelectromechanical devices such small separations are realized , such casimir forces should be taken into account and are of technological interest @xcite .",
    "the reader may find an extensive account of the theory and measurements of casimir forces and a list of references in @xcite .",
    "thirty years after casimir s pioneering work @xcite , fisher and de gennes pointed out in a seminal paper @xcite that analogous effective forces can be generated by long - wavelength , low - energy classical thermal fluctuations of systems near critical points between macroscopic objects immersed into them such as plates and container walls .",
    "the subject of such critical casimir forces has attracted considerable attention during the last 25 years .",
    "early attempts to detect such forces focused on their indirect confirmation through their effects on wetting layers @xcite .",
    "subsequently , bechinger s group accomplished direct measurements of critical casimir forces between a wall and colloidal particles immersed into binary fluid mixtures near their consolute points @xcite .    just as the casimir forces of qed ( qedcf ) , critical casimir forces ( ccf ) exhibit universal properties .",
    "they depend on gross features of the medium that mediates them , namely , the universality class of the associated bulk critical behavior , on gross features of the immersed macroscopic objects or walls , which usually are encoded in the large - scale boundary conditions of the continuum field theory , and geometry . despite obvious analogies between qedcf and ccf",
    ", there are a number of crucial differences between them . though pointed out previously ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , these differences are not always fully appreciated .",
    "a first obvious difference is that ccf originate from thermal rather than quantum fluctuations .",
    "quantum fluctuations do not contribute to the leading large - distance asymptotic behaviors unless one is dealing with fluctuation - induced forces near quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "a second important difference is the following : the universal properties of qedcf can normally be modeled by effective free field theory in which interaction of the electromagnetic fields with macroscopic objects such as metallic plates are taken into account via boundary conditions . in the case of ccf ,",
    "one usually must deal with interacting classical field theories such as @xmath2 theories .",
    "this is dictated by the requirement that the bulk critical behavior is properly described .",
    "a further difference is that unlike qedcf , ccf are not normally fully fluctuation induced .",
    "the reason is that the order parameter @xmath31 may acquire a nonzero average in a strip geometry  either in the low - temperature regime ( if the system has long - range order ) or even generically at all temperatures as in the case of classical fluids and binary fluid mixtures owing to the explicit breaking of the @xmath32 symmetry by boundary fields @xcite . if @xmath33 , then this average will react to changes of the separation between boundary planes , producing thereby an effective force even in landau theory .",
    "if so , the ccf consists of a non - fluctuating background plus fluctuation - induced contributions .    in the present paper",
    "we shall focus on the case of ccf in systems whose critical behavior can be described by an @xmath1 invariant hamiltonian .",
    "our interest in this problem derives from several sources .",
    "first of all , the @xmath34 case is of direct relevance for experiments that measure ccf in @xmath13he near the superfluid @xmath35 transition via the thinning of wetting layers @xcite .",
    "second , we believe that this problem represents a much closer analog to qedcf than that of binary fluid mixtures . this is because the order - parameter profile @xmath36 of @xmath13he remains zero for all temperatures @xmath6 whenever the thickness @xmath3 of the strip is finite .",
    "third , we consider this challenging problem to be of fundamental importance .",
    "what makes it quite hard is that it involves difficulties beyond those usually encountered in studies of ccf in systems with free boundaries , namely , the requirement to simultaneously treat bulk , boundary , and finite - size critical behaviors .",
    "the additional complication one must cope with in the case of three - dimensional strips with @xmath1 symmetric hamiltonian is the subtle dimensional crossover of a three - dimensional bulk ( @xmath5 ) system with long - range order ( lro ) at low temperatures to an @xmath7 strip with no lro at any @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to elucidate these problems and show how they can all be handled within one and the same approach , namely , the exact solution for @xmath0 .",
    "we will explain why the @xmath37 solutions for the scaling functions of the residual free energy and the ccf under free boundary conditions ( fbc ) are considerably harder to obtain than their analogs under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and that the behaviors of the former differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those of the latter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the @xmath1 @xmath2 model on a strip , specify the boundary conditions , and discuss its finite - size phase diagram .",
    "we then recall that the model can be solved exactly in the @xmath0 solution in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a selfconsistent one - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "we consider a model defined by the reduced hamiltonian @xmath38=\\int_{\\mathfrak{v}}\\!{\\mathrm{d}}^dr\\,\\big[\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\bm{\\phi})^2+\\frac{{\\mathring{\\tau}}}{2}\\phi^2+\\frac{g}{4 ! n}\\phi^4\\big]+\\frac{{\\mathring{c}}}{2}\\int_{\\mathfrak{b}_1\\cup\\mathfrak{b}_2}\\!{\\mathrm{d}}^{d-1}y\\,\\phi^2\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , is a real - valued @xmath41-component order - parameter field defined on the @xmath42-dimensional strip @xmath43 $ ] .",

    ", we have chosen the same value of @xmath56 on both boundary planes .",
    "relaxing this condition by choosing different values of @xmath57 on @xmath58 would be straightforward @xcite but not necessary here because we shall focus on the case in which the large - distance behavior is governed by a fixed point corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions ( dd ) on both planes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which can be studied by setting @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the model under pbc along the @xmath62-direction , @xmath63 is defined in a similar fashion ; in this case the boundary term involving @xmath64 in eq .   is absent since there are no boundaries .",

    "these models are superrenormalizable .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities in multi - point cumulants can be absorbed in the bulk critical value @xmath68 ( pbc and fbc ) and an analogous special value @xmath69 ( fbc ) by introducing the renormalized quantities ( pbc and fbc ) @xmath70 and ( only fbc ) @xmath71    if one regularizes by means of a large - momentum cutoff @xmath72 , these shifts vary as @xmath73 and @xmath74 . at @xmath75",

    ", we shall not have to bother with this matter .",
    "however , bulk and surface free energies require subtractions ( additive counterterms ) to cancel their uv singularities even when @xmath67 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to occasional remarks at appropriate places and otherwise refer the reader to more detailed expositions in the literature .      keeping in mind that quantities such as free energies and the partition function require a regularization of uv singularities to be well defined",
    ", we introduce the partition functions formally through the functional integral @xmath77\\,{e}^{-\\mathcal{h}[\\bm{\\phi}]}$ ] and the reduced free energy @xmath78 per surface area @xmath79 and number of components .",
    "we can then define the limit @xmath0 of the free energy ( area ) density @xmath80 , the bulk free energy density @xmath81 , the excess free energy density @xmath82 , the surface free energy @xmath83 , and the residual free energy @xmath84 through @xmath85 the bulk free energy @xmath81 is independent of the boundary conditions ( pbc or fbc ) .",
    "the other four free energies differ for fbc and pbc .",
    "specifically , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 depend also on the surface interaction constant @xmath56 , while @xmath89 .      the hamiltonian   of the @xmath1 @xmath2 theory is invariant under the continuous @xmath1 symmetry . according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite",
    ", such a symmetry can not be spontaneously broken at any temperature @xmath6 in bulk systems with short - range interactions if @xmath90 . however , for @xmath91 a phase with long - range bulk order ( bulk lro ) exists below a critical temperature @xmath92 .",
    "rigorous extensions of the mermin - wagner theorem imply that classical ferromagnetic @xmath1 models on networks can not have a spontaneous magnetization at any @xmath6 if random walks on the same structure are recurrent , i.e. , return to their starting point with probability one @xcite .",
    "since random walks in a three - dimensional rectangular cuboid of cross - sectional area @xmath93 and finite thickness @xmath3 are recurrent , no lro phase is possible for @xmath66 at any @xmath6 when @xmath7 . at @xmath66",
