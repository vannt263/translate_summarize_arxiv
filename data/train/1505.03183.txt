    "the ability to reliably prepare multi - particle entangled states is crucial for applications in quantum information science @xcite and quantum enhanced metrology @xcite .",
    "dicke states @xcite constitute a particularly robust class of maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "their preparation has been demonstrated with photons @xcite and ions @xcite . however , these approaches are difficult to scale up to many particles . in experiments with neutral atoms dicke states",
    "have been prepared using spin - changing collisions @xcite or cavity - based quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the successful preparation of a dicke state is heralded by light . in those experiments ,",
    "the success probability is extremely low if high fidelity is to be achieved .",
    "ensembles of rydberg atoms with long - range interactions offer a platform that could overcome both the problem of scalability and low success probability .",
    "first demonstrations of the preparation of a @xmath0 state ( or first dicke state ) @xcite with rydberg atoms have been reported @xcite , however , they face the problem that due to the probabilistic loading of traps the atom number is not know precisely . since the collective rabi coupling depends on the atom number this leads to relatively low fidelity of the state preparation .",
    "we propose a scheme in which the successful preparation of a @xmath0 state is heralded by the detection of an ion , making use of the possibility perfect rydberg blockade in small ensembles of atoms .",
    "this scheme achieves near - unity preparation fidelity and the atom number uncertainty only deteriorates the success probability , which is still much larger than in experiments with atoms in optical cavities .",

    "the coupling laser causes ac stark shifts , which differ between different rungs of the dicke ladder .",
    "this makes it possible to tune the the probe laser to resonance between the collective ground state @xmath1 and only one dressed excited state . ]",
    "the proposed @xmath0 state preparation scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](a ) . in brief , an ensemble of @xmath2 atoms",
    "is confined to a volume smaller than the rydberg blockade radius , such that only one atom can be excited to a rydberg state , and all atoms are initialized in the ground state @xmath3 .",
    "the ensemble is then excited to a collective state containing one rydberg excitation @xmath4 and one excitation in a metastable intermediate state @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently , the number of rydberg excitations is measured by field ionization and detection of the removed ion .",
    "the remaining @xmath6 particles are then left in the state @xmath7 .",
    "the key point of this scheme is that the successful preparation is _ heralded _ by the detected ion",
    ". the excitation step will not always be successful due to fluctuating atom numbers or other imperfections , but if the rydberg atom was detected , one can be sure that the @xmath0 state was prepared successfully .",
    "otherwise the preparation scheme can be repeated until the preparation is successful .",
    "essential for this scheme is the ability to drive rabi - oscillations between two collective states without populating any other states .",
    "this is achieved by strongly laser coupling the intermediate and the rydberg state ( @xmath8 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) , which causes ac - stark shifts of the collective states .",
    "these shifts differ between states with different numbers of excited atoms since the effective rabi - couplings between these states are collectively enhanced for higher excited states .",

    "we assume perfect rydberg blockade @xcite , which means that the rydberg - rydberg interactions are only reflected by the fact that many - body states with more than one atom in the rydberg state are excluded from the hilbert space .",

    "the effective detuning can be compensated ( approximately ) by modifying the probe detuning to @xmath71 ( as also done in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi_osc ] ) .    in order to demonstrate that this fidelity is not decreased much by fluctuations in the atom number @xmath2 we calculated the mean fidelity for a poissonian atom number distribution with mean @xmath72 for @xmath73mhz .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity](b ) .",
    "the weighted average over the poisson distribution gives an infidelity of @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 obtained for @xmath59 with an optimal @xmath42-pulse .",
    "this also illustrates that the excitation time can be chosen much smaller than @xmath42-pulse without loss of fidelity , but only at the expense of a smaller success probability , which makes the scheme robust not only with respect to atom number fluctuations but also to imperfect control of the spatial and temporal shape of the probe laser pulse .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity](c ) we show the infidelity as a function of @xmath8 for different atoms numbers keeping @xmath65mhz fixed .",
    "the infidelity decreases as @xmath76 and becomes smaller than @xmath77 for rabi frequencies exceeding @xmath78mhz . by estimating the off - resonant admixture of states containing rydberg excitations other than @xmath31 we find that @xmath79 presents an upper bound on the infidelity .",
    "so far we have assumed perfectly coherent dynamics .",
    "however , in a realistic scenario various sources of decoherence , such as spontaneous emission , finite laser line - widths , and atomic motion will be present . in the following we discuss the effect of such imperfections on the fidelity of our protocol . in order to include decoherence effects",
    "the system is described by a density operator obeying the master equation ( me ) @xmath80+\\mathcal{l}[\\rho ] \\,.\\ ] ] decoherence effects can be included via lindblad terms @xmath81=\\gamma_k\\left(s_{k}\\rho s_{k}^\\dagger - 1/2\\left\\{s_{k}^\\dagger s_{k},\\rho\\right\\}\\right)\\ ] ] where , e.g. , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for spontaneous emission from the intermediate ( rydberg ) level , respectively , and @xmath84 for single - atom dephasing of the rydberg state ( @xmath85 is the atom index ) . to account for dephasing effects that do not affect all atoms independently but the ensemble as a whole",
    ", we consider projectors on the collective states @xmath86 .",
    "decay of the intermediate level leads to incoherent population transfer from @xmath31 to singly excited states involving the unwanted state @xmath87 and thus decreases the fidelity .",
    "decay from the rydberg state will harm the proposed scheme less , since such a decay leaves the system in a state without rydberg excitation and thus does not produce false heralds .",
    "the infidelity as a function of decay rates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity](d ) for @xmath57 atoms , @xmath73mhz , and @xmath65mhz",
    ". the infidelity increases linearly with the time - integrated decay probability ( @xmath88 ) , where the proportionality factor is about a factor of five smaller for the dependence on @xmath63 compared to @xmath62 .",
    "other decoherence effects include finite laser linewidths , atomic motion , and stray electric fields stark shifting the rydberg state .",
    "these effects can result in single - atom or collective dephasing .",
    "collective dephasing here means , that the coherences between the symmetric dicke state are damped but no coupling to asymmetric states is caused as the perturbing process also conserves the exchange symmetry of the atoms .",
    "such process do not harm our scheme much .",
    "single atom dephasing , on the other hand , leads to the distribution of population into states outside the symmetric dicke state manifold and therefore reduces the probability to prepare the symmetric state @xmath31 .",
    "again , the infidelity increases linearly with the dephasing rate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity](d ) . to avoid imperfection due to decoherence",
    "short excitation times ( large @xmath51 ) are required . on the other hand",
    "we have seen that in order to minimize couplings to unwanted state small ratios of @xmath89 are favorable .",
    "thus , in order to reach the maximum fidelity of @xmath0 state preparation for given @xmath8 and given rates of the decoherence process , the effective rabi frequency ( or duration of the protocol ) can be optimized and the maximum fidelity for given atomic parameters depends crucially on the achievable coupling laser strength .",
    "another possible issue is whether the ion and electron that might traverse the atomic ensemble after ionization would degrade the fidelity by inducing local stark shifts or collisions with the remaining atoms . in order to assess this effect we performed classical monte carlo trajectory simulations assuming that the ionizing electric field is ramped from @xmath90 to @xmath91kv / cm in @xmath92ns @xcite . as an example we use the differential @xmath93-polarizability @xmath94 of @xmath95sr clock transition @xcite to estimate the induced local phase shifts .",
    "the ion leaves a trap of diameter @xmath96 m in about @xmath97ns . for a trap of volume @xmath96m@xmath98 containing @xmath59 atoms ,",
    "the probability to induce a significant phase shift in an atom - ion collision turns out to be smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "the ionizing electric field itself also does not affect the coherence between states @xmath3 and @xmath5 significantly .",
    "the proposed scheme assumes that one operates in the regime of perfect rydberg blockade , meaning that the interaction shift is much larger than the laser line widths and coupling strengths @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the ensemble size should not exceed a few micrometers .",
    "at the same time the mean distance between the particles must not become too small such that effects of the interaction of the rydberg electron with the surrounding ground state atoms can be neglected .",
    "this limit the atom numbers that can be used to a few tens or hundreds .",
    "a more detailed account of the effects of imperfect blockade and ground - rydberg state interactions are left for future studies .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the most important requirement for achieving high fidelities in the proposed scheme is a small spontaneous decay rate from the intermediate level @xmath5 .",
    "note that using , e.g. , the @xmath101 state of rubidium as intermediate state is not possible due to its fast decay rate of tens of mhz .",
    "two possible ways to overcome this problem are outlined in the following .    using rubidium or other alkali atoms ,",
    "one possibility is to use two hyperfine ground states as @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the coupling to the rydberg state can then either be achieved by a two - photon transition via an ( off - resonant ) optically excited state or by directly coupling to rydberg state using a laser in the uv - range @xcite .",
    "the transition between the two lower states can either be driven by microwaves or by a two - photon raman transition .",
    "such schemes have recently been successfully implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "the raman scheme might also allow for a doppler free implementation @xcite .",
    "a second possiblity is to use alkaline earth ( like ) atoms , such as ca , mg , sr , or yb , that are promising because of their metastable triplet @xmath102-states , which have been extensively used in optical atomic clocks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . many alkaline earth ( like ) species have been laser - cooled to microkelvin temperatures and their transitions from the @xmath103 ground state to states @xmath104 or even the doubly forbidden @xmath105 offer a wide range of linewidths ( see e.g. table v in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from the intermediate state",
    ", @xmath106 rydberg states can be excited by blue or near uv - lasers .",
    "the rydberg interaction potentials are similar to those of alkaline atoms for s - states ( near - isotropic van der waals ) @xcite .",
    "atomic structure calculations for these states have recently been reported @xcite .",
    "also , there have been first experiments using rydberg states of @xmath95sr @xcite .",
    "the greatest challenge for both implementations will be to build strong enough blue lasers . here , recent efforts in the context of rydberg dressing and direct rydberg excitation from the ground state could lead to significant advances in the near future @xcite .",
    "for example , tunable , solid - state lasers producing @xmath107 of narrow - band cw light have been developed for this wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "we also note that most experiments the trapping potential would be anti - trapping for the rydberg states and thus has to be switched off during the preparation sequence involving the population of rydberg states . for a further processing of the prepared @xmath0 states it might be necessary to recapture the ensemble after the preparation , which may pose an additional experimental challenge .",
    "however , if recapture or operation in a trap with magic wavelength rydberg trapping could be achieved , this would allow to repeat the preparation sequence [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](a ) ] without having to reload the trap in every cycle but by re - initializing the internal state of the atoms by optical pumping into the ground state .",
    "this might reduce the atom number in the sample in cases where a rydberg atom was present but was not detected due to the finite efficiency of ion detection .",
    "note , however , that current experiments reach 90% detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have proposed a scheme for the preparation of a maximally entangled @xmath0 state heralded by the detection of an ion .",
    "this scheme could be implemented using small clouds of ultracold alkali or alkaline earth atoms in a small optical dipole trap .",
    "so far , we restricted ourselves to the low @xmath108 part of level structure of the artificial atom created by the coupling laser .",
    "higher excited collective states could be prepared using a sequence of probe pulses with different frequencies or by employing adiabatic preparation schemes @xcite . due to their multi - particle entanglement ,",
    "higher excited dicke states have many applications in metrology @xcite and quantum information science @xcite .",
    "dicke states are not spin squeezed in the conventional sense @xcite , but nevertheless their entanglement is useful for sub - shot - noise interferomentry . in general , the maximum fringe contrast that can be obtained is a spectroscopic measurement with a given input state is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the quantum fisher information @xcite",
    ". for dicke states of @xmath2 spins with @xmath111 excitations , one obtains @xmath112 , so for a @xmath0 state @xmath113 we have @xmath114 , which means that the fringe contrast can be enhanced at most by a factor @xmath115 compared to the shot - noise limit .",
    "thus , ideally one would like to prepare the state with @xmath116 , corresponding to @xmath117 in the notation used above .",
    "this state enables spectroscopy at the heisenberg limit @xcite and is also useful for quantum information processing tasks , such as @xmath118 telecloning or open - destination teleportation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian of the artificial atom can be mapped to the jaynes cummings model , where the role of the @xmath19-excitation is taken by the photons and the @xmath20-state corresponds to the state of the two - level atom in the cavity . in the dicke basis",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath119 thus , the probe field @xmath120 would account for a coherent external drive of the cavity while the coupling laser part resembles the hamiltonian of a single atom in a cavity , where @xmath108 is the number of cavity photons and the atomic ground ( excited ) state corresponds to the absence ( presence ) of a rydberg excitation .",
    "one could envision an experiment , in which first a probe pulse is applied which creates a coherent superposition of the states @xmath121 ( binomial distribution ) . then switching on",
    "the coupling laser would induce collapse and revival dynamics of the rydberg population , characteristic for the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "another interesting question concerns the motional state of the ensembles after the removal of the rydberg atom .",
    "can the ionization be done in a coherent way , such that a superposition of different position states is created instead of an incoherent mixture ?",
