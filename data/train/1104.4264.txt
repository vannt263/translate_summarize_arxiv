    "x - ray binaries show different spectral states depending on the different contribution of the emission components .",
    "the neutron star low mass x - ray binary ( ns lmxbs ) spectra are complex and difficult to explain , and the precise origin of the spectral components are still debated .",
    "different models in fact can describe the same observed spectra .",
    "historically , concerning the soft x - ray range ( 1 - 20 kev ) , two main models were used for the x - ray spectra of lmxbs : the `` eastern model '' consists of the sum of an optically thick multi - temperature disk , plus a comptonized blackbody originating from the neutron star or boundary layers between the disk and the neutron star @xcite ; the `` western model '' uses a comptonised spectrum due to repeated inverse compton scattering of the soft seed photons by hot electrons with a thermal distribution of velocities , plus a single temperature blackbody emission @xcite .    in",
    "the past years observations also in the hard x - ray bands ( @xmath220 kev ) indicated that broad - band spectral studies are necessary to model and explain all the components and features observed in the soft and hard spectral states of ns lmxbs . during the soft spectral state the soft thermal component is predominat .",
    "the thermal component could come from differents emission regions or combination of these , such as either the optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk that emits as a black body with a local temperature depending from the disk radius ( t(r)@xmath3 ) , or the thermal surface of the ns , or the ns boundary layers .",
    "indeed the emission regions of these components are generally known although difficult to discern from the observed spectra . during the hard spectral state the soft component decreases or is even not detected , while the contribution of the comptonization component due to the repeated compton upscattering of the soft photons in a hot electron cloud ( corona ) is predominant in the spectra .",
    "the hard component could extend above 200 kev , and in some cases no cut - off at high energy is observed @xcite , which is the signature for non - thermal emission .",
    "the spectral state transition from soft to hard state is often modelled in terms of a gradual increase of the electron temperature of the comptonising region which is typically in the range of 3 - 10 kev for the soft states and it increases to the range 10 - 100 kev for the hard ones .",
    "moreover , depending on the geometry of the binary system and on the position of the disk respect to the observer , the additional reflection component could be present in the spectra of the lmxbs .",
    "this is due to compton reflection of the hard x - ray by material of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "recently lin et al . ( 2007 ) applied a new model for the high - luminosity soft states of lmxbs with ns , ispired to the black hole binaries ( bhbs ) behaviour .",
    "this model consists of blackbody plus multicolor disk blackbody with no need for a strong comptonized emission .",
    "however , as the luminosity decreases , the comptonized component is required also for this model .",
    "4u  172834 is a lmxb of the atoll class @xcite containing a ns as indicated by the observation of type - i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the detection of eddington - limited bursts allowed a distance estimate of 4.4 - 5.1 kpc @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the persistent emission of 4u  172834 over a wide energy band has been studied with different satellites in the past years : einstein @xcite , _ granat _",

    "@xcite , _ chandra _ , _ rxte _ @xcite and _ integral _ @xcite .",
    "the broad - band spectra were modeled with a disk blackbody emission plus a thermal - comptonization component with varying optical depth and electron temperature @xcite .",
    "residuals from the fit in the 6 - 9 kev interval were interpreted either as a broad ( @xmath4 0.3 - 0.7 ) gaussian emission line at 6.7 kev or as two absorption edges of ionized iron at 7 and 9 kev @xcite .",
    "4u  172834 is one of the few atoll sources detected in the radio band up to now @xcite .",
    "the radio and x - ray fluxes follow a correlation similar to that found for black - hole binaries ( bhs ) and z sources which are typically more luminous than atolls @xcite . z and bh",
    "sources could show a non - thermal tail in the x - ray energy spectra ; the presence of this hard tail seems to be correlate with the position of the source in the color - diagram and the radio properties @xcite .",
    "the analysis of non - thermal spectral components in atoll sources is , in general , more complex than in brighter x - ray binaries due to the low statistics involved , though _ integral _ recently provided important results @xcite .",
    "the hard tail component could originate from a hybrid thermal / non - thermal population of electrons in a corona near the compact object ( @xcite ) as already revealed in the atoll 4u 182030 in its hard state @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the hard tail component could originate from non thermal electrons coming from the base of a jet @xcite .",
    "the bulk motion comptonization model ( bmc ) @xcite applied usually for bh , was recently used also in ns ( comptb model ) and represents an alternative physical explanation of the detected hard tails @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyse data from a year - long rxte / integral monitoring campaign of 4u  172834 and show a non - thermal tail detected in the x - ray spectra of this source .",
    "the _ integral _ monitoring of 4u  172834 consists of two parts : the first ( february - april 2006 ) is part of galactic centre deep exposure observations and the second of key program pointings as well as public data ( general program ) ( 2006 august - october and 2007 february - april ) .",

    "for spe1 the @xmath16 is worse than that of a simple comptonization component and for spe2 the best - fit temperature of the blackbody is very low and difficult to constrain . in conclusion the comptt+bb model can be applied to the soft states for which the blackbody temperature decreases and the electron plasma temperature increases from spe6 to spe4 . for the hard states : the spectral parameters ( @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 ) do not change monotonically from spe3 to spe1 ( as the source becomes harder ) as in general observed for these type of sources , moreover the @xmath16 is not good ( see spe1 results ) .",

    "we try to use two different hard component as described in the following models ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) . in both cases to fits the data using the double blackbody it is necessary to freeze the soft component parameters ( either the temperature or the normalization values ) otherwise the fits with the double blackbody model are not costrained . moreover the double blackbody is any more necessary for the hard states ( in fact only one is sufficient to take into account the soft emission ) .",

    "the simultaneous _ rxte _ and _ integral _ long monitoring observations allow us to study over a broad energy band ( 3200 kev ) the different spectral states of 4u  172834 selected according to the position on the pca hardness - intensity diagram , as well by the _",
    "integral _ high energy behavior of the source .",
    "in general the observed spectra of 4u  172834 turned out to be difficult to model .",
    "in particular at low energy the presence of the blackbody or disk blackbody emission are difficult to constrain because the pca is sensitive for e@xmath2 4 kev , and at high energy there seems to be a non - thermal component during the hard state that needs to be investigated .",
    "a number of models provide statistically satisfactory fits to our data .",
    "we prefer models that provide spectral parameters with physical meaning and at the same time evolve regularly through the source states .",
    "the simplest spectral model that describes well the observed spectral states is the sum of blackbody and comptonization ( comptt ) emission for the soft states and comptonization with the addition of the power law for the hard states . in the soft spectra",
    "the comptonization would arise from a corona with a low electron temperature of about 47 kev and high optical depth of 23 , with input seed photons of temperature 0.60.8 kev .",
    "the blackbody temperature @xmath18 is 2.32.5 kev and consistently higher than the seed photons temperature which gives rise to the comptonization processes .",
    "this indicates that the blackbody emission could come either from inner parts of the disk or from the boundary layer while the seed photons could be due to the emission from the outer part of the disk or from the ns surfarce directly .",
    "the compatibility of the boundary layer temperature predicted from the spreading layer model @xcite with the obtained @xmath18 supports the hypothesis that the blackbody component originates from the boundary layers . only the most luminous soft state could be also modelled with a double thermal emission ( simple blackbody plus disk blackbody emission ) . in this last case",
    "the temperature of the blackbody is still compatible with the boundary layer emission while the disk emission has lower temperature ( 1.7 kev ) and would come from the outer part of the disk .",
    "the hard spectra can be described by a thermal comptonization with a temperature of the electrons of @xmath1 610 kev and optical depth of 3 , plus a power law with photon index of @xmath1 1.82.5 . as the spectrum becomes harder , the temperature of the electrons increases and the optical depth decreases .",
    "the seed photon temperature does not change much during the soft to hard spectral variation indicating the same emission region ( in this case the hypothesis of the ns emission origin could be suitable ) .    by combing the results of these two models for the hard and soft states , we note that the variation of the physical parameters values is quite monotonic ( within the error values ) . during the hardening the blackbody temperature , @xmath18 ,",
    "decreased ( until it is no longer detected in the hardest states ) , the comptonization component increased in temperature , @xmath19 , and decreased in optical depth , @xmath17 , while the seed photons temperature value , @xmath20 , did not vary significantly .",
    "the detection of a hard tail component for this atoll source , even if not the emission prominent in our data , represents an important results , but our data do not allow us to establish a proper origin .",
    "the detection of radio emission during the hard state could indicate the link of this non - thermal emission with a jet formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , as the bhcs show hard states associated with jet formation , this could be also the case for atoll sources .",
    "radio emission was already observed from 4u  172834 but unfortunately during our observations no radio coverage was available for this source .",
    "alternatively , the hard states could be also modelled by a blackbody component with temperature of 1 kev plus a comptonization ( compps ) with higher electron temperature ( 2026 kev ) and a high energy tail due to a hybrid thermal - non thermal composition of the electron plasma .",
    "hence the hybrid thermal - non thermal composition of the electron population in the corona appears as a plausible explanation for the hard tails detected .",
    "we found that the hard states could also be modelled without the use of the comptonization component but with the use of the phenomenological model consisting of a blackbody plus a broken power law with a high energy cutoff as already used by lin et al .",
    "2007 .    in the hardest spectrum ( spe1 )",
    "the relative flux contribution above e@xmath260 kev is about 10@xmath7 , i.e. similar to the value in the hard state of 4u  182030 and , in general , is of the same order of other hard tail flux contribution in ns systems @xcite @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that this source presents flux variations that not always reach the same value of hardness , as shown by the hardness intensity diagram .",
    "this indicates that the hardest spectrum characterised by the power law component can not always be reached by the source , this could explain the difficulty to detect this component in previous observations of the source .",

    "<S> we report results of a one - year monitoring of the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) source ( atoll type ) 4u  172834 with _ integral _ and _ rxte_. three time intervals were covered by _ integral _ , during which the source showed strong spectral evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the broad - band x - ray spectra in detail by fitting several models in the different sections of the hardness - intensity diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the soft states are characterised by prominent blackbody emission plus a contribution from a comptonized emission . </S>",
    "<S> the hard states are characterised by the presence of an excess flux with respect to the comptonization model above 50 kev while the soft component is fainter . to obtain an acceptable fit to the data this excess </S>",
    "<S> is modeled either with a power law with photon index @xmath0 @xmath1 2 or a comptonization ( compps ) spectrum implying the presence of hybrid thermal and non - thermal electrons in a corona . </S>",
    "<S> this makes 4u  172834 one of the few lmxbs of atoll type showing non - thermal emission at high energy . from our analysis , it is also apparent that the presence of the hard tail is more prominent as the overall spectrum becames harder . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss also alternative models which can discribe these hard states .    </S>",
