    "tunnelling emerges .",
    "abdullaev and kraenkel analyzed the nonlinear resonances and chaotic oscillations of the fractional population imbalance between two coupled bec s in a double - well trap with a time - dependent tunneling amplitude for different damping @xcite .",
    "they also considered the chaotic atomic population resonances and the possibility of stabilization of the unstable - mode regime in coupled bec s with oscillating atomic scattering length @xcite . in a previous paper , we investigated the chaotic and frequency - locked population oscillation between two coupled becs @xcite .    although many papers appear in the field of the tunnelling between coupled becs , because of the nonlinearity in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , few of them address the question of calculating the tunnelling rate and the crossover temperature between different tunnelling regimes .",
    "however , the tunnelling rate and the crossover temperature of the spin systems have been studied systematically with the imaginary - time path - integral method , including models with applied magnetic field @xcite and without @xcite . for a two - state system described with linear schr@xmath3dinger equation , it is easy to visualize the effects of coupling between two states by introducing bloch s spin vector formalism @xcite .",
    "can we introduce a generalized bloch vector for two coupled becs described with the nonlinear schr@xmath3dinger equation to map it onto a spin system , and then calculate the tunneling rate and the crossover temperature with the imaginary - time path - integral method ? if the coupled becs is equivalent to a spin system , the tunnelling process is related to the decay of the metastable mqst state to the ground state .",
    "more interestingly , the crossover temperature corresponds to the transition from the classical or mean - field regime to the second quantization regime . in the next section , by introducing a generalized bloch spin vector , the coupled becs is mapped onto an uniaxial spin with an applied magnetic field . in section iii , the tunneling rate is calculated with the imaginary - time path - integral method , and the crossover temperature is estimated . in the last section , a brief discussion and summary is given .",
    "consider the experiments of jila @xcite , two bose - einstein condensates in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spin states of @xmath6 are coupled by a two - photon pulse with the two - photon rabi - frequency @xmath7 and a finite detuning @xmath8 .",
    "where , @xmath9 is the driven frequency of the two - photon pulses , @xmath10 is the transition frequency between two hyperfine states . in the rotating frame , ignoring the damping and the finite - temperature effects , the coupled two - component bec system can be described by a pair of coupled gpes @xmath11 where , the free evolution hamiltonians @xmath12 @xmath13 and the mean - field interaction hamiltonians @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 is the scattering length between states @xmath18 and @xmath19 and it satisfies @xmath20 .",
    "weak coupling is defined by the rabi frequency satisfying @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the geometric - averaged angular frequency for the trapping potential . in this regime",
    ", we can write the macroscopic wavefunctions using the variational ansatz @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xmath13 . in the ansatz",
    ", the functions @xmath25 describe the spatial distribution of the @xmath26 component , the complex coefficient functions @xmath27 are spatially uniform and contain all time - dependence in the macroscopic quantum wave - functions @xmath28 .",
    "the symbols @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the populations and phases of the @xmath26 condensate , respectively . because the coupling is very weak , the spatial distributions vary slowly in time and are very close to the adiabatic solutions to the time - independent uncoupled case for gp equations @xmath31 , being slaved by the populations@xcite .",
    "thus , the complex coefficient functions @xmath32 obey the nonlinear two - mode dynamical equations @xmath33 the parameters satisfy @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the terms in @xmath38 describe population transfer ( internal tunnelling ) between two bec states , whereas the terms in @xmath39 , which depend on the numbers of atoms in each bec state , describe the mean - field interaction between atoms .",
    "when @xmath40 and @xmath41 equal zero , these coupled equations can also describe the becs in a double - well potential @xcite .",
    "similar to the coupled two - state system obeying the linear schr@xmath3dinger equation , we introduce a generalized bloch spin vector @xmath42 with the components @xmath43 obviously , @xmath44 is a conserved quantity when finite - temperature and damping effects can be ignored . rescaling the time @xmath45 to @xmath46 , the bloch spin vector satisfies @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . regarding the atom in one condensate as spin - up state and the atom in the other condensate as spin - down state , the coupled becs can be described with the quasi - spin @xmath50 . in this language ,",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath51 depicts the population difference , and the transverse components @xmath52 and @xmath53 characterize the coherence .",
    "thus the effective hamiltonian for the quasi - spin is @xmath54 the above hamiltonian is similar to the one of a uniaxial spin with an applied magnetic field @xcite , it indicates that the mean - field interaction brings the anisotropy @xmath55 , the coupling causes an effective transverse magnetic field @xmath38 along axis-@xmath56 , and the asymmetry or the detuning induces an effective longitudinal magnetic field @xmath57 . in the symmetric case",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 , it is consistent with the one derived from the second quantized hamiltonian in @xcite .",
    "in conventional spherical coordinates , the spin components can be written as @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "thus , the corresponding effective hamiltonian is formulated as @xmath63 based upon the analysis of a spin in a uniaxial magnetic field @xcite , we know that there are stationary states if some angles @xmath64 satisfy @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the condition @xmath67 locates the stationary states in the @xmath68 plane @xmath69 .",
    "the existence of multiple stationary states in this quasi - spin system is equivalent to the existence of multiple metastable mqst states in the coupled becs . near the metastable states the potential describes a  canyon ",
    "satisfying @xmath70 the parameters obey @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as stated in the previous section , the parameter @xmath74 , therefore @xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to the equal - phase mode @xmath77 and the anti - phase mode @xmath78 in the coupled two - component becs , respectively . in the case of @xmath79 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is just the negative detuning @xmath80 , thus @xmath81 and @xmath82 correspond to the red detuning and the blue detuning of the coupling laser , respectively .",
    "the @xmath66 is equivalent to @xmath83 , that is , @xmath84 .",
    "for some critical points where both the first and the second derivatives of @xmath85 equal zero , an appreciable tunnelling rate appears .",
    "this gives @xmath86 here , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are critical values for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . solving the above equations , one can obtain @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the system has an instanton solution at the critical point @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "this critical point stands on the separatrix between the single stable regime and the multiple - stable regime .",
    "it separates the metastable multi - mqst behavior between the single - stable population oscillation in the coupled two - component bec .    according to the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath89",
    ", we obtain that the condition for the existence of multiple stationary states is @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "one can easily find the small oscillations around these stationary states with nonzero time - averaged values for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these oscillations correspond to the phase - locked mqst states with time - averaged relative phase @xmath100 or @xmath2 and multiple stationary states correspond to multiple metastable mqst states with fixed nonzero population difference and relative phase @xmath100 or @xmath2 .",
    "the appearance of multiple stationary sates indicates , only for some proper parameters , that multiple metastable mqst states exist . for simplicity we only consider the case where the parameter @xmath90 is slightly lower than the fixed critical value @xmath88 , @xmath101 , @xmath102",
    "this requires that the rabi frequency , the detuning , the scattering lengths , and the total atomic number in the coupled bec system must cooperate with each other to approach the critical values for the emergence of multiple metastable mqst states .",

    "for fixed value of @xmath55 and @xmath103 , the tunnelling exponent @xmath114 decreases with the increasing of the intensity of the coupling laser . in fig .",
    "2 , we show how the tunnelling exponent @xmath114 depends on the angle @xmath106 .",
    "in the region between @xmath100 and @xmath2 , the ratio @xmath126 decreases from positive infinity to zero when the angle @xmath106 equals @xmath127 , which corresponds to the symmetric case @xmath128 , and then increases to positive infinity when the angle @xmath106 is close to @xmath2 .",
    "it is almost flat when the angle @xmath106 is not close to @xmath100 , @xmath127 and @xmath129 .",
    "this angular dependence indicates , in the case of fixed value of @xmath130 , that the tunnelling exponent increases with increasing latexmath:[$%     the result for the angle @xmath106 close to @xmath127 , which corresponds to the symmetric case @xmath132 , should be taken with great caution because the coefficient @xmath133 in the taylor expansion series @xmath134 is equal to zero . in this case",
    ", the problem corresponds to the tunnelling between two equivalent minima which correspond to the angle @xmath135 equal @xmath100 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus the potential can be expanded into the form of @xmath136 and the tunnelling exponent @xmath114 is expressed as @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the tunnelling exponents @xmath138 and @xmath139 only hold for the asymmetric case where @xmath140 .    to confirm our prediction from the quasi - spin model , we perform a numerical simulation of the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "a qualitative change in the stationary - state behavior occurs at @xmath141 .",
    "when @xmath142 , there are no metastable states for any effective detuning @xmath57 . however ,",
    "when @xmath143 , metastable states exist in the region @xmath144 $ ] for proper relative phase , where @xmath145 satisfies @xmath146 .",
    "see the left column of fig .",
    "two stationary states , indicated as @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the figure , are stable and the other one @xmath149 is unstable .",
    "adiabatically changing the effective detuning @xmath57 from @xmath150 to @xmath151 ( @xmath122 is a very small positive number ) , in the space of the fractional population difference @xmath152 and the relative phase @xmath153 , a trajectory in the vicinity of @xmath148 becomes a large orbit @xmath154 encircling @xmath147 . from the views of instanton method ,",
    "the tunnelling exponent is determined by the canonical action of the orbit , i.e. , @xmath114 follows from the path integral @xmath155 over the continuum of trajectories which are close to the instanton solution . at different bifurcation points @xmath145 ,",
    "the numerical results show @xmath156 , this confirms our previous prediction from the quasi - spin model ( see the right column of fig .",
    "there are two important aspects which must be noted .",
    "the one is that these results for tunnelling are only valid in the low barrier limit for the quasi - spin model , i.e. , @xmath157 .",
    "this means that the above results only hold in the region which approaches the critical point of emergence of multiple metastable mqst states .",
    "the parametric dependence of the general case is still an open problem .",
    "the other is the validity of the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) semiclassical approximation .",
    "the semiclassical approach can only be used in the case of small tunnelling probability , that is , @xmath158 . in this low barrier limit , from the taylor expansion series @xmath134 one can obtain the following tunnelling amplitude by using the theory developed by caldeira and leggett @xcite , @xmath159 here , @xmath160 is the angular frequency of small oscillations near the bottom of the inverse potential .",
    "apparently , when the angle @xmath106 is close to the @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) , which corresponds to small rabi frequency or large detuning of the coupling laser between two becs , the tunnelling amplitude @xmath163 approaches to zero , see fig .",
    "as presented in above , in the case of @xmath106 close to @xmath127 which corresponds to the symmetric case @xmath132 , the potential is not in form of @xmath164 but in form of @xmath136 because the coefficient @xmath133 in the taylor expansion series @xmath134 equals zero .",
    "therefore , the above formula for the tunnelling amplitude only holds for the asymmetric case @xmath165 . generally , contrary to the tunnelling exponent @xmath114 , the tunnelling amplitude @xmath163 is sensitive to the structure of quantum levels in the potential",
    "therefore , for the case of the full potential @xmath108 and @xmath166 , the estimation of @xmath163 is still an open problem .",
    "population transfer between two states in a bistable system can occur either due to classical thermal activation which depends on the system temperature or due to quantum tunnelling which does not depend on the system temperature .",
    "there exists a phase transition from the thermal regime to the quantum regime which occurs at the crossover temperature @xmath167 . above @xmath168 ,",
    "quantum effects are very small and the population transfer rate follows the arrhenius law , @xmath169 here , @xmath170 is the height of the energy barrier between two states and @xmath171 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "below @xmath167 , the population transfer is purely quantum , @xmath172 with @xmath114 independent of the system temperature .",
    "thus the transition occurs when @xmath173 . neglecting the prefactors and equating the exponents , the crossover temperature can be estimated as @xmath174 the transition region is approximately the temperature interval @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "this crossover resembles a first - order phase transition of the tunnelling rate @xmath110 because it is accompanied with the discontinuity of @xmath176 at @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "there is another regime for tunnelling , the thermally assisted tunnelling ( tat ) , in which the particle strides over the barrier to the bottom of the potential with lowering temperature @xcite .",
    "the transition from the classical regime to the tat regime resembles a second - order classical - quantum phase transition of the tunnelling rate @xmath110 because it is accompanied with a discontinuity of @xmath177 and no discontinuity of @xmath176 at the crossover temperature .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature can be estimated as @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath160 are the period and the angular frequency of small oscillations near the bottom of the inverse potential , respectively @xcite . in the low barrier limit @xmath180 , from the taylor expansion series @xmath134",
    ", one can obtain the barrier height @xmath181 where , @xmath182 comparing both crossover temperatures , one can easily find that they differ by a factor @xmath183 , which means that they are of the same order of magnitude and can both be used to estimate the crossover temperature .",
    "below , from the experimental parameters in the experiments of jila @xcite , we will give a quantitative estimation for the tunnelling rate and the crossover temperature .",
    "in those experiments , the atomic mass @xmath184 kg , the time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) magnetic trap has an axial frequency @xmath185 hz and a radial frequency @xmath186 hz , the @xmath187-wave scatter lengths @xmath188 nm , @xmath189 nm and @xmath190 nm , and the total atomic number @xmath191 . to obtain the numerical values conveniently , we choose the natural units of the problem , in which , time is in units of @xmath192 , length is in units of the size of the geometric - averaged harmonic - oscillator length @xmath193}=\\sqrt{\\hbar /(\\overline{% \\omega } m_{rb})}$ ] , energy is in units of the geometric - averaged trap level spacing @xmath194 , and mass is in units of rb atomic mass @xmath195 .    due to gravity acting besides the top",
    ", the centers of two condensates will displace along the vertical direction and the two equilibrium displacements are generally not the same .",
    "thus , if the interparticle interaction is absent , the lowest single - particle state has the familiar wave function , @xmath196 where , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 is the offset between two potential centers along the vertical axis , @xmath200 @xmath201 are the oscillator lengths .",
    "the offset @xmath202 between two condensates can be varied by adjusting the magnitude of the rotating magnetic field . in the presence of interatomic interaction ,",
    "the dimensions of the condensates are changed .",
    "the spatial parts of the macroscopic quantum wave functions are in the shape of @xmath203 the variational parameters @xmath204",
    "@xmath205 @xmath206 depend on the scattering length , the total atom number , and the trapping potential and they have almost the same numerical values as @xmath207 . for proper values of the offset @xmath199 ,",
    "the numerical results of @xcite show that the spatial distributions @xmath25 and their overlap only weakly depend on the total atom numbers in each condensate . for simplicity , in the following calculations ,",
    "the variational parameters @xmath208 are replaced by the oscillator lengths @xmath207 .",

    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath55 equals zero , thus the metastable multi - mqst behavior will never appear , but some running - phase mqst states may still exist .",
    "this indicates that , to insure the existence of multiple metastable mqst states , a finite offset must be kept between two condensates .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of this kind of mqst requires @xmath215 . because @xmath216 and @xmath217 , this inequality indicates that the rabi frequency and the detuning of the coupling pulses must be relatively small . choosing the total atom number @xmath218 , the half offset @xmath219 , the rabi frequency @xmath220 hz , and the detuning @xmath221 hz",
    ", one can get @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "thus , the corresponding tunnelling exponent @xmath114 and crossover temperature @xmath168 are around @xmath226 and @xmath227 nk , respectively .",
    "obviously , the crossover temperature @xmath167 , which corresponds to a phase transition from classical tunnelling to quantum tunnelling , is far below than the critical temperature @xmath228 nk for bose - einstein condensation in a dilute gas of @xmath229 .",
    "the generalized bloch equation @xmath230 and its stability analysis will help to control the population transfer and realize the single - qubit operation with becs qubit .",
    "theoretically , any two - state quantum system can serve as a qubit , many of them have been realized experimentally . to make use of two quantum states ,",
    "the coherence and superposition between them is the most essential qualification .",
    "the experimental observation of coherence and superposition between two becs indicates the possibility of encoding two coupled becs as a qubit .",
    "however , because of the mean - field interaction among bosonic condensed atoms , the qubit operations become very difficult to perform . to accomplish a single - qubit operation ,",
    "it must be possible rotated arbitrarily in the hilbert space .",
    "this requires the atomic populations can be transferred arbitrarily . from the bloch equations ( 4 ) , we find that mqst prevents the arbitrary rotation of the state vector . and even if there no mqst , when @xmath231 , the complete population inversion can not be accomplished with linear operations .",
    "thus , to accomplish a linear qubit operation , one has to adjust the parameter @xmath55 to zero by varying the atomic scattering length with a feshbach resonance @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mean - field interaction gives a density - shift to the original energy levels and , according to rabi s theory , the arbitrary rotation of the state vector can be performed easily .",
    "thus , if one encodes the qubit states @xmath232 and @xmath233 as the condensate wavefunctions for two condensates in a double - well potential or two hyperfine - state condensates coupled with raman pulses @xcite , an arbitrary one - bit linear operation can be realized when the anisotropy is absent @xmath234 and an arbitrary one - bit nonlinear operation can be realized when the metastable multi - mqst behavior is absent @xmath235 .",
    "this means that , to perform an arbitrary one - bit transformation , it at least needs choosing proper parameters to avoid the emergence of the metastable multi - mqst behavior .",
    "the tunnelling of the quasi - spin model described by the hamiltonian @xmath211 has also been investigated by mapping it onto a particle moving in an asymmetric double - well potential @xcite . using this approach , garanin et .",
    "al . have explored some new fascinating feature of this uniaxial spin model in the strongly biased limit @xcite .",
    "they find that there exist two different regimes for the classical - quantum transition of the tunnelling rate and the kind of transition depends on both the strength and the direction of the magnetic field . in this article",
    ", we directly analyze the tunnelling in the low barrier limit for the quasi - spin model , which corresponds to the effective magnetic fields near their critical values for appearance of metastable states .",
    "this requires that all physical parameters of the coupled becs collaborate with each other to approach the critical point of appearance of multiple metastable mqst states .",
    "the symmetric case @xmath128 of the coupled becs corresponds to the unbiased case @xmath236 of the anisotropic spin model , which has been investigated in details by mapping it onto a particle moving in a symmetric double - well potential @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic quantum tunnelling of two - component becs has also been investigated by the kasamatsu group . using a numerical approach ,",
    "they have analyzed the tunnelling between two kinds of metastable stationary states , a symmetry - breaking state ( sbs ) and a symmetry - preserving state ( sps ) , in uncoupled two - component becs @xcite . to improve the usual gaussian variational method ,",
    "they have introduced a collective coordinate approach and then calculated the tunnelling rate within the wkb approximation . in that system ,",
    "the populations of the two components can not be converted into each other because of the absence of coupling .",
    "this means , the tunneling does not occur between two components but between stationary states with different spatial configurations .",
    "thus , this kind of tunnelling originates from the quantized spatial structure of the hamiltonian . in our model , due to the coupling",
    ", the population can be transferred from one component to the other .",
    "furthermore , we assume the coupling is very weak , thus both components stay in their ground stationary states through the full process .",
    "the metastability ( metastable mqst ) is the result of the cooperation between the coupling and the mean - field interaction ( including both the intra - component and the inter - component interaction ) .",
    "correspondingly , the tunneling from the metastable self - trapped state to its ground state of the coupled two - component becs is caused by the quantized structure of their field operators .    in conclusion",
    "a system of coupled becs ( two becs in a double - well potential or two internal state becs coupled with laser pulses ) has been mapped to a spin in a magnetic field by introducing a generalized bloch vector .",
    "the mean - field interaction , the coupling and the asymmetry or the detuning are relevant to the anisotropy , the transverse magnetic field and the longitudinal magnetic field , respectively . the corresponding generalized bloch equation is obtained .",
    "the analysis of this generalized bloch equation will be propitious to control the population transfer and realize the quantum computation with coupled becs . based upon experience from the well - studied tunneling of spin systems , the detailed information about the tunnelling between two metastable mqst states in coupled two - component becs",
    "can be obtained with the imaginary - time path - integral method .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath167 at the critical point for a transition from the classical thermal regime to the quantum regime was obtained .",
    "when the system temperature decreases through @xmath167 , the population conversion goes from classical thermal activation regime to purely quantum tunnelling regime .",
    "this means , below the crossover temperature @xmath167 , the quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields take the dominant position .",
    "we also find that the tunnelling rate can be adjusted by varying the coupling and the trapping magnetic field .",
