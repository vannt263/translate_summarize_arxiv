    "h dibaryon is a compact bound ( or resonance ) state of six quarks , @xmath9 , with spin@xmath10 , isospin@xmath10 and strangeness@xmath11 , proposed by jaffe in 1977@xcite . the lowest two baryon threshold with these quantum numbers is the s - wave , spin - singlet @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) state .",
    "the reason why the h dibaryon is interesting is that the quark model dynamics , which describes the ground state hadrons very well , suggests a strong attractive force in this channel .",
    "in particular , the flavor su(3 ) singlet configuration of the six quarks is favored most by the color - magnetic force ( @xmath14 ) , which is responsible for the spin splittings of the pseudo - scalar and vector mesons as well as the octet @xmath15 and the decuplet @xmath16 baryons .",
    "it is also shown that the fermi - dirac statistics for quarks allows all six quarks can occupy the lowest orbit making a fully symmetric orbital state and therefore no pauli blocking effect may induce short - distance repulsion among the quarks .",
    "thus a compact six - quark - like state is expected in the quark models@xcite .",
    "the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) also allows color - singlet six - quark states .",
    "recent lattice calculations have indeed suggested existence of either a bound or resonance state around the @xmath12 threshold , although the physical quark - mass point calculations are yet to come@xcite .",
    "against all these theoretical indications , long experimental efforts in searching the h dibaryon were unsuccessful so far .",
    "the observation of the double hypernucleus has given an upper bound for the binding energy@xcite , while an enhancement is observed in the @xmath12 production around and above the threshold.@xcite .",
    "under these circumstances , it is interesting to explore possibilities of finding the h dibaryon in various production mechanism@xcite . in this paper , we investigate the radiative fusion production of h , @xmath17 , in an environment of finite temperature baryon gas .",
    "suppose that a heavy ion collision produces significant number of strange baryons in a temperature @xmath18 .",
    "then through the radiative fusion , the h dibaryons may be produced associated with emitted characteristic photons .",
    "the goal is to calculate the production rate from the finite-@xmath18 @xmath19 gas into h dibaryons . in the present calculation",
    "we assume that our final state is a @xmath6n bound state and the radiative transition is through mixing of @xmath6n ( intermediate ) states with @xmath12 states .",
    "our setup here is as follows .",
    "the final state is a spin - singlet s - wave bound state of @xmath6 and n. the radiative decay occurs most strongly from the p - wave @xmath6n ( @xmath20 ) states .",
    "we consider both the spin singlet ( @xmath21 ) and the spin - triplet ( @xmath22 ) @xmath6n states .",
    "they mix with the p - wave @xmath12 states , which due to the pauli principle is always spin - triplet ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "then overall , the transition goes from @xmath23 to @xmath6n@xmath24 to @xmath25 .    in order to calculate the production rate ,",
    "we apply the imaginary time method ( itm )  @xcite , in which imaginary time is identified with inverse temperature .",
    "this method allows us to replace the sum of the initial scattering - state distribution at finite temperature by solving a schrdingier - type differential equation with the imaginary - time variable .",
    "the advantage of the itm is that it takes into account the contributions of all the excited initial states automatically without approximation and explicit treatment of them , for instance , discretizing the continuum energy spectrum .",
    "this advantage was demonstrated in the study of the triple - alpha radiative capture process  @xcite , which plays a key role in synthesizing @xmath26 in stars  @xcite . in particular , at low temperatures the reaction rate of this process is very difficult to calculate , since direct capture of the three - alpha particles through their scattering states becomes important , but formal scattering theory of the three - charged particles is not available .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation at high temperatures , in which the reaction proceeds through the so - called hoyle state , the resonant @xmath27 state at @xmath28 mev in @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "however , the itm that does not require any boundary condition of the three - charged particles could overcome this difficulty and was found to be very powerful method .    in this study",
    ", we extend the itm mentioned above in coupled - channel calculations , in which the three - channel initial states , @xmath29 and @xmath1n@xmath30 , are considered .",
    "we show that the coupled - channel itm reduces conputational time significantly , since it does not require solving scattering initial states explicitly . the calculated transition rate at high temperatures is shown to be insensitive to the energy positions of the h dibaryon , though the h dibaryon is assumed to be bound in this calculation , due to a constraint of the present method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in sect .",
    "2 , we summarize the formulation of the coupled - channel itm .",
    "the hamiltonian for the initial states is taken from the nijmegen potentials supplemented by an anti - symmetric spin - orbit ( als ) force .",
    "the als is necessary to mix the spin 0 @xmath6n state with spin 1 .",
    "the final state energy , i.e. , the h dibaryon mass , and its wave function are computed by assuming a simple gaussian potential for @xmath31 @xmath6n system .    in sect .",
    "3 , we present details of our calculation , solving the imaginary time differential equation step by step .",
    "our main results are shown , i.e. , the reaction rates for various temperatures , contributions of the initial channels , as well as dependencies of the results on the choices of parameters of the model .    in sect .",
    "4 , conclusions are given .",
    "in this paper , we consider the transition process in the heavy ion collisions . as mentioned in introduction , h dibaryon is assumed to be @xmath32 bound state of @xmath1 and n as the final state of the radiative capture reaction .",
    "@xmath33 states are thus not assumed to change into the h dibaryon directly by emitting a photon , though they are thermally distributed as the initial states .",

    "<S> we consider @xmath5 transition to h from @xmath6n @xmath7 scattering states which mix with @xmath8 . in order to calculate the transition rates , we formulate a coupled - channel imaginary time method by extending the one - channel formula originally proposed by yabana and funaki . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary time method allows us to avoid the sum over all the excited thermal initial states , and thus to save computational time significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the transition rates are given as a function of temperature and the unknown binding energy of the h dibaryon , which we take as a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the transition rate is not sensitive to the choices of the h binding energy or the strengths of the channel coupling for temperatures 3 mev or higher . </S>"
