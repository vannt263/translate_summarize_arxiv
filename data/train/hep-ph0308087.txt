    "a knowledge of the partonic structure of the proton is an essential ingredient in the analysis of hard scattering data from @xmath9 or @xmath10 or @xmath11 high energy collisions .",
    "however , only the @xmath12 ( or scale ) dependence of the parton distributions can be calculated from perturbative qcd .",
    "perturbative qcd can not fix their absolute values . moreover , non - perturbative techniques are still far from being able to predict reliable magnitudes .",
    "rather , to determine the distributions , it is necessary to resort to global analyses of a wide range of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data .",
    "the bjorken @xmath13 dependence of the distributions is parameterized at some low scale , and a fixed order ( either lo , nlo or nnlo ) dglap evolution performed to specify the distributions at the higher scales where data exist .",
    "much attention is now being devoted to obtaining reliable uncertainties on the parton distributions obtained in this way .",
    "one obvious uncertainty is due to the systematic and statistical errors of the data used in the global fit .",
    "we will call these the _ experimental _ errors on the parton distributions and on the physical observables predicted from them .",
    "in fact , these so - called experimental uncertainties of the partons have so far been the main focus of attention .",
    "they have been estimated by several groups @xcite@xcite , working within a nlo framework using a variety of different procedures .",
    "for instance , in a previous paper @xcite we estimated the parton errors using a hessian approach in which we diagonalised the error matrix and then used the linear propagation of errors to estimate the uncertainty on a variety of typical observables .",
    "we confirmed that this simple approach works well in practice by using a more rigorous lagrange multiplier method to determine the errors on the physical quantities directly .",
    "we also compared our results with those obtained in similar analyses performed by the cteq collaboration  @xcite .    besides the _ experimental _ errors , there are many other sources of uncertainty associated with the global parton analysis .",
    "these are the concern of the present paper .",
    "they may loosely be called _ theoretical _ errors .",
    "that is , we use theoretical errors to denote all uncertainties on the predicted observables other than those that arise from the systematic and statistical errors of the data that are included in the global fit .",
    "the various theoretical errors may be divided into four categories .",
    "uncertainties due to ( i )  the selection of data fitted , ( ii )  the truncation of the dglap perturbation expansion , ( iii )  specific theoretical effects ( namely @xmath14 , @xmath2 , absorptive and higher twist corrections ) and ( iv )  input assumptions ( such as the choice of parameterization , heavy target corrections , whether isospin violation is allowed and the form of the strange quark sea ) .",
    "these theoretical errors are discussed in turn in the following four sections .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : implications ] , we study the implications of the error analysis for determining the value of @xmath15 from the global fit , and for the accurate predictions of particularly relevant observables at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "in principle , if the dglap formalism is valid and the various data sets are compatible , then changing the data that are included in the global analysis should not move the predictions outside the error bands . in practice",
    "this is not the case . as an extreme example , consider the analysis of the h1 and bcdms deep inelastic data for @xmath16  @xcite . the absence of the other fixed target data and , in particular , the tevatron jet data from the global parton fit results in a gluon which is much smaller for @xmath17 , and hence larger at small @xmath13 , from those obtained in global fits to a wider range of data .",
    "another example occurs in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where fitting to a small subset of the total data ( namely h1(94 )  @xcite , bcdms  @xcite and e665  @xcite data for @xmath18 ) yields a surprisingly low value @xmath19 , and a very hard high @xmath13 down - quark distribution",
    ". even fits of different groups , at the same perturbative order , to basically the same data lead to unexpectedly sizable differences in partons and in predictions for observables .",
    "for example , compare the mrst2002 and cteq6 predictions at nlo for the cross sections for @xmath4 and higgs boson production at hadron colliders , shown in fig .",
    "15 of ref .",
    "we see that the cteq6 values at the tevatron are more than @xmath20 smaller for @xmath4 production and 8% smaller for higgs production ; differences which are larger than expected from an analysis based on the experimental errors of the data used in the fits .",
    "we begin by investigating the stability of the global parton analysis to different choices of the data cuts ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , defined such that data with values of @xmath4 , @xmath13 or @xmath12 below the cut are excluded from the global fit , with the implicit assumption that the remaining data can be described by pure leading - twist dglap evolution .",
    "we find the minimum values of the data cuts for which this stability occurs .",
    "the kinematic variable @xmath4 is the invariant mass of the system @xmath24 recoiling against the scattered lepton in deep inelastic lepton ",
    "proton scattering @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that w^2 q^2(1-x)/x . [ eq : wsquared ] in the remainder of this section , all fits are performed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) unless otherwise stated . in section  [ sec : change ] we discuss what happens when we use the nnlo formalism .      in the original mrst global analyses we have fitted to data with @xmath27 , assuming that this was sufficiently high to avoid resonance structure , large @xmath2 effects and associated higher - twist corrections",
    "however , we had no quantitative justification for this precise choice , and , noting that it resulted in a systematically poor fit to slac data with @xmath28 , we subsequently raised the cut to @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "this provided an acceptable description of the slac data . in order to make a more systematic investigation of the stability of the fit to varying this cut",
    ", we performed a series of global analyses with @xmath30 ranging from 12.5 to @xmath31 . when raising the cut from 12.5 to @xmath32 we find @xmath33 to the remaining data improved by only 4 , while an increase of @xmath30 from 15 to 20 or @xmath31 resulted in no significant improvement . taking these results at face value ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath34 is a conservative choice and that there is no reason to eliminate even more data .",
    "however , inspection of the description of the slac and bcdms data in this low @xmath26 region shows a lack of compatibility of the two data sets in the region where they overlap ; specifically for @xmath26 in the interval @xmath35 for the higher values of @xmath13 .",
    "thus the stability achieved at @xmath36 corresponds to the slac data completely disappearing from the fit .",
    "hence , while the resulting fit describes the bcdms data well , an extrapolation to only slightly lower @xmath26 values gives a very poor description of the slac data .",
    "this implies that the achieved stability is an artifact of the incompatibility of the two data sets for @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , when phenomenological higher - twist contributions are introduced into the analysis they still have significant impact for @xmath38 , see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "this implies that a genuinely conservative choice of cut would be @xmath39 .",
    "however , because a good description is obtained of the only available data in the @xmath40 interval we may set @xmath41 without prejudicing the analyses .",
    "future measurements of @xmath18 at hera in this kinematic domain would clearly be valuable .      in table  1",
    "we show the values of @xmath33 for global analyses performed for different values of @xmath22 , together with the number of data points fitted .",
    "each column represents the @xmath33 values corresponding to a fit performed with a different choice of the cut in @xmath13 . for example , if only data above @xmath42 are fitted , then the total @xmath43 , with a contribution of @xmath44 coming from the subset of data with @xmath45 , and @xmath46 from the subset with @xmath47 , etc .",
    ".[tab : t1 ] each column shows the @xmath33 values obtained from a nlo global analysis with a different choice of @xmath22 , together with the number of data points fitted and the value of @xmath48 obtained .",
    "the first @xmath33 entry in a given column is the total @xmath33 , and the subsequent entries show the contributions to @xmath33 from subsets of the data that are fitted .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 , shown in the final row , is a measure of stability to changing the choice of @xmath22 , as explained in the text . in these analyses",
    "we take the default cut in @xmath12 , that is @xmath50 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are a number of conclusions which can be drawn from the table .",
    "first , we can see that there is no clear evidence for any significant higher - twist contributions for @xmath51 .",
    "even though it may be argued that the form of the higher - twist corrections at small @xmath13 is rather more complicated than the simple parameterization of ( [ ht ] ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , they would have to be of roughly the same qualitative form , and the lack of any indication of them appears compelling .    at nlo there is a strong indication of a negative higher twist contribution for @xmath52 .",
    "this is required in order to make @xmath53 large enough for the nmc data in this region .",
    "however , the sizes of the @xmath54 s in this region decrease significantly when going to nnlo , because both the coefficient functions and splitting functions at nnlo lead to increased evolution in this range , and the evidence for higher twist at nlo seems to be really an indication of a lack of important leading - twist , higher - order corrections .",
    "the main higher - twist corrections appear , as expected , at high @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath55 there is a slight indication of a negative higher - twist correction at nlo , but this diminishes at nnlo and effectively disappears at nnnlo .",
    "hence this is presumably just an indication that leading - twist perturbative corrections are important .",
    "a transition is apparent for @xmath56 , and for @xmath57 there is a definite positive higher - twist contribution .",
    "however , this contribution has a tendency to decrease from one order to the next .",
    "indeed at nnnlo the required higher - twist contribution at very high @xmath13 is similar to that achieved simply from target - mass corrections @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this very high @xmath13 domain , the correction to the higher - twist coefficient when going from nnlo to nnnlo is as large , if not larger , as when going from nlo to nnlo ( the nlo to nnlo correction is smaller than the lo to nlo ) .",
    "it is easily verified that this is indeed because the nnnlo correction to the structure function is as large at nnnlo as at nnlo for this range of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "this shows that the divergent high-@xmath13 perturbative series discussed in section  4.2 reaches its minimum at about nnnlo , and this represents the essential ambiguity in this series .",
    "hence the renormalon contribution to the higher twist @xcite , which comes from this ambiguity of the perturbative series , is roughly of the same size as the nnnlo contribution ( at least in the region of parameter space we are probing ) .",
    "indeed , the prediction for the higher - twist contribution as a function of @xmath13 in @xcite is very similar to that obtained from the approximate nnnlo contribution .",
    "this implies that at very high @xmath13 it is pointless to go beyond nnlo ( or certainly nnnlo ) in the perturbative series , since at this order the perturbative series and higher - twist corrections become indistinguishable .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that this is a special feature of high @xmath13 , i.e. , low @xmath26 , and does not imply the same is true for other regimes of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    to conclude , by going to higher and higher orders in the leading - twist perturbative expansion we see that the only strong evidence for higher - twist corrections is in the region of high @xmath13 and low @xmath26 .",
    "all shortcomings of low - order perturbative calculations seem to be reduced , if not removed , simply by working to higher orders .",
    "moreover , our particular knowledge of high @xmath13 coefficient functions leads us to believe that we have reached the stage where the perturbative expansion and higher twist corrections are not really separable .",
    "this is further illustrated by a method which goes beyond the standard logarithmic resummation using the ` dressed gluon exponentiation ' approach of @xcite , which takes into account some all - order information on the kernel of sudakov resummation itself . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this combined resummation of sudakov logarithms , renormalon contributions and higher twists was confronted by data on the nachtmann moments ( i.e. corrected for target mass ) of the structure function extracted from low @xmath12 data . while it is impossible to estimate precisely the higher twist contributions ,",
    "one allowed description is that where the sudakov resummation alone is necessary to explain the high - moment data .",
    "over the years we have adopted parameterizations with more and more free parameters , as required by the increase in precision and kinematic range of the data , and by the new types of data that have become available .",
    "perhaps the biggest single extension of the parameterization was the contribution added to the gluon that allowed it to become negative at small @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently other groups have investigated the influence of parton parameterizations on parton uncertainties @xcite , with various conclusions . in @xcite , which describes a fit to a fairly limited set of data , it is found that there is no real improvement to the quality of the fit once the number of parameters specifying the input parton distributions has increased past a certain number , 10 in this case . in @xcite , however , a new type of parton parameterization is used , and it is claimed that this is necessary in order to obtain the best fit to the tevatron jet data .",
    "our studies do not support this claim .",
    "although the fit to the tevatron jet data in @xcite is indeed better than in @xcite , and even in @xcite ( where the high @xmath13 gluon has been improved ) , we believe very little of this is due to the parton parameterization .",
    "there are various differences between the cteq6 and mrst2002 approaches to global fits including the choice of @xmath12 cuts , the data sets included in the fit , the treatment of errors ( particularly those of the e605 drell - yan data ) and even the definition of @xmath58 at nlo . in @xcite",
    "we discussed in detail the effect of making our starting point for the fit more and more like that for cteq6 , and discovered that when we did so our fit to the jet data became of almost similar quality to that of cteq6 when using our own parameterization ( without any of the `` kinks '' found in some previous best fits to jet data @xcite ) .",
    "some of the further cuts we have introduced in the course of the investigations in this paper have led to even better fits to the tevatron jet data .",
    "hence , we do not feel that these particular data require us to alter our parton parameters to obtain the best possible fits .",
    "however , we do note that the fact that our parameterization does allow the input gluon to be negative does have important consequences compared to the cteq analysis .",
    "it means that the cteq6 gluon is always larger at very small @xmath13 than ours ( even though their starting scale is a little larger , @xmath59 , our gluon is still negative at this @xmath12 ) , and from the momentum sum rule must be smaller elsewhere , in practice at intermediate @xmath13 .",
    "this does lead to predictions which are significantly different to ours , examples being the higgs cross section at the tevatron and lhc as seen in fig .",
    "15 of @xcite .    indeed , there is considerable evidence that we have , if anything , too much flexibility in the parton parameterizations .",
    "when attempting to diagonalize the error matrix for partons when all the parameters were left free we discovered that many were extremely correlated ( or anti - correlated ) leading to some very flat directions in the eigenvalue space @xcite .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain a stable error matrix we found that it was necessary to observe the departures away from the best fit while allowing only 15 of our nominal 24 parton parameters to vary .",
    "a similar effect has , in fact , also been seen in @xcite , where when producing the error matrix only 16 out of a possible 22 parameters are allowed to vary , and in @xcite , where only 20 out of 26 parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "similar problems are not seen by other groups @xcite , all of whom use smaller data sets and a smaller number of parton parameters , implying that they have either the correct number of parameters for the flexibility required by their data , or potentially slightly too few .",
    "variations in the parton parameters would lead to some pathological behaviour ( particularly for the gluon ) , implying that the fit is on the verge of the same type of redundancy problems as in @xcite and @xcite . ]",
    "the redundancy observed when calculating the error matrix does not mean that all the other parameters can simply be dispensed with , since it is necessary to allow most to vary in order to obtain the best fit itself , and to allow the partons to have a sufficiently flexible shape .",
    "it just means that not all the parameters need to vary in order to investigate small deviations from the best fit partons .",
    "for example , starting with our previous parameterization for the gluon xg(x , q_0 ^ 2 ) = a_g(1-x)^_g(1+_g x^0.5+_g x)x^_g , it was necessary to add a term of the form -a_-(1-x)^_-x^_- , in order to let the input gluon be negative at small @xmath13 .",
    "only 3 parameters were needed to investigate small variations , but more parameters are certainly needed in order to obtain the gluon for the best fit . however , the total of 7 free parameters we have for the gluon ( @xmath60 is fixed by the momentum sum rule ) do have some genuine degree of redundancy .",
    "we have noticed in the course of performing many fits that , for any fixed value of @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , we can obtain optimum descriptions of the data which are practically identical in quality . in these",
    "fits all gluon parameters are significantly different , but the gluon distributions produced are practically identical ( at least between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is perhaps the clearest example of a single parameter which is essentially redundant , but we have other similar examples .",
    "hence , we conclude that our input parameterizations are sufficiently flexible for the present data .",
    "we do not seem to have the optimum parameterization for both finding the best fit and also investigating fluctuations about this best fit .",
    "for a fully _ global _ fit , however , no - one else seems to have it either . to achieve",
    "this would require fewer parameters than at present .",
    "this might then influence our error analysis using the hessian approach somewhat , but we feel it is unlikely to affect our best fit partons very much at all .",
    "when fitting the ccfr @xmath66 and @xmath67 data  @xcite we have to use some model for nuclear shadowing corrections . the form that we use for the heavy target correction factor",
    "is deduced from a @xmath12-independent fit to the emc effect for the scattering of muons on a heavy nuclear target ( a=56 ) . to be explicit ,",
    "we parameterize the correction as r_ht  =  \\ {    l l 1.238 + 0.203_10x & for  x<0.0903 + 1.026 & for  0.0903<x<0.234 + 0.783 - 0.385_10x & for  0.234<x .    .",
    "in order to investigate the uncertainty arising from this correction we perform a series of fits , maintaining the central plateau in @xmath68 , but changing the slopes in @xmath69 in the high and low @xmath13 regions .",
    "in addition , we allow the normalisation to vary within the experimental error , as usual .",
    "we study the quality of the fit as a function of the value of the heavy target correction at the lowest @xmath13 value ( @xmath70 ) , for which ccfr data exist .",
    "this data point receives the largest heavy target correction , that is @xmath71 for our standard fit .",
    "this is a very similar , but larger , correction to that for the highest @xmath13 value ( @xmath72 ) for which data exist .",
    "[ fig : f5a ] shows the global @xmath33 as a function of the value of @xmath68 at @xmath70 . clearly our standard shadowing assumption , although near to the minimum , is not the absolutely optimum choice of shadowing correction .",
    "the data prefers a value of @xmath73 of @xmath74 , i.e. a slightly smaller correction than our usual choice , and the improvement in the fit is about @xmath75 units of @xmath33 .",
    "most of this improvement comes from the fit to the ccfr data on @xmath76 , which has always had a tendency to lie underneath the theory when shadowing corrections are applied ( see for example fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "the main effect of the slightly reduced shadowing is just to bring these data in line with the theory ( although there are some other minor improvements ) and the parton distributions themselves are not changed much at all , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : htpart ] . by the nutev collaboration actually tend to lie a little above those of ccfr in the lowest @xmath13 bins , and hence lie rather closer to the default theory curves with our standard shadowing correction @xcite . ]",
    "similarly the deuterium data is corrected for shadowing effects .",
    "these prescriptions are not unique . in our fits",
    "we normally use the parameterization in @xcite which uses a theoretical model to estimate the nuclear shadowing corrections at relatively small @xmath13 .",
    "there are other alternatives for models of this type of shadowing .",
    "there has also been a prescription for deuterium shadowing corrections extracted by the slac e139/140 experiments @xcite .",
    "this is an empirical extraction which uses a model @xcite in which binding effects are assumed to scale with nuclear density .",
    "this gives a relatively large shadowing correction for deuterium , especially at large @xmath13 , and was used as a basis for an analysis of the @xmath77 ratio in @xcite . the validity of this extraction is rather controversial ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but we use the results simply as an estimate on the uncertainty of the deuterium shadowing corrections .",
    "as such , a fit with this shadowing correction applied to the deuterium data gives an estimate of the model uncertainty from this source on the high @xmath13 valence partons , particularly @xmath78 .",
    "this particular correction leads to a larger neutron structure function at high @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the largest change in the parton distributions is in the high @xmath13 down quark distribution , which increases significantly . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deutshaddv ] this increase is a little smaller at high @xmath13 than the uncertainty due to errors on experimental data that was estimated using the hessian matrix method in @xcite . from the constraint on",
    "the number of valence quarks the increase in @xmath79 at high @xmath13 must be compensated for elsewhere , and indeed we see that it is smaller than the default for @xmath80 , but is well within the bounds of the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the change in the @xmath81 distribution must lead to a modification of the @xmath81 distribution in order to obtain the best overall global fit .",
    "this modification is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : deutshaduv ] .",
    "although it is proportionally much smaller than the change in @xmath79 , @xmath81 is much better constrained by data , and the change due to the different shadowing correction can be as big as , or even slightly larger than the uncertainty due to experimental errors on data .",
    "however , this is mainly so at @xmath82 where the direct constraint on valence quarks is quite small since sea quarks dominate , and the estimated uncertainty from the hessian method for valence quarks alone is likely to have limitations related to parameterizations .",
    "hence , for the down and up quark distributions we conclude that model errors on shadowing corrections in deuterium are typically of the same size as the errors due to the experimental errors on deuterium structure function data .",
    "finally we note that the quality of the global fit when using the deuterium corrections in @xcite is 12 units in @xmath33 , better than the default fit .",
    "there is a slight improvement in the total fit to deuterium data , mainly to the bcdms data , but a slight deterioration in the fit to e605 drell - yan data .",
    "there is also a slight improvement in the fit to high-@xmath83 tevatron jet data .",
    "this is to be expected since the increased down quark distribution at high @xmath13 leads to an increase in the highest @xmath83 jet cross - section , which is what is required .",
    "however , the improvement is limited since an increase in @xmath78 at high @xmath13 increases the momentum carried by the down quark . from the momentum sum rule",
    "this makes it harder to have a large gluon distribution at high @xmath13 , which the fit would like . in practice",
    "a compromise is reached , i.e. an even greater enhancement in @xmath79 at high @xmath13 would slightly improve the fit to deuterium , and so other data , but actually makes the fit to tevatron jet data worse .",
    "the relatively small improvement in the global @xmath33 from this model of deuterium shadowing , partially limited by tension between different data sets and parton distributions , leads us to conclude that there is no strong supporting evidence for the model . nevertheless , the small pull of the evidence is in favour of some deuterium shadowing at high @xmath13 .",
    "global fits have traditionally assumed that the shape of the input strange quark sea distribution is the same as the average of the input @xmath84 distribution .",
    "the primary experimental constraint on the strange distribution is provided by data on dimuon production in neutrino  nuclei deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "these data are consistent with the shape assumption , and in addition constrain the magnitude of the strange distribution to be approximately half of @xmath85 at low @xmath12 . for this reason",
    ", we conventionally choose s(x ) = ( |u(x ) + |d(x ) ) at @xmath86 .",
    "we now investigate the sensitivity to this input assumption .",
    "first , we check the validity of our choice by expressing s(x ) = ( |u(x ) +    strange sea provided by ccfr  @xcite , for various different fixed values of the parameter @xmath87 .",
    "the variation in @xmath33 is shown as a function of @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] .",
    "the continuous and dashed curves correspond to including all ccfr data or omitting those ccfr data at the lowest @xmath12 value , @xmath88",
    ". the latter may be more appropriate since nlo leading - twist distributions might become unreliable at such a low scale .",
    "we see that our default choice of @xmath89 is near the minimum when the @xmath88 ccfr data are included , but is perhaps a little large when these data are omitted .",
    "the choice @xmath90 appears optimum for both data selections .",
    "we therefore make a set of partons available with this value . in the future ,",
    "nutev dimuon data will better determine the strange sea .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the variation of @xmath87 on the quality of our standard global fit ( in which the contribution of the dimuon data is not included ) .",
    "this is shown by the ( shallower ) dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] .",
    "we see that the minimum is obtained for @xmath91 and that the @xmath33 is about 8 lower than for the mrst(2002 ) set .",
    "hence this is a rather small improvement in the fit and leads to a very small change in the parton distributions .",
    "this value of @xmath87 is near the limit of acceptability as determined by the dimuon data .",
    "we conclude that the level of uncertainty of parton distributions , and related quantities , is rather small , particularly as it weakened by evolution to higher @xmath12 .",
    "isospin symmetry implies that the parton distributions of a neutron are obtained from those of the proton simply by swapping the up and down quark distributions , i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in the absence of any obvious evidence to the contrary",
    "this is always assumed to be true in global fits .",
    "there are many sets of data in the global fit which would in principle be sensitive to any isospin violation .",
    "these are the various sets of deuterium structure function data ( slac , bcdms , nmc ) , the ccfr neutrino structure function data from isoscalar targets , the e605 drell  yan data on a copper target , and the na51 and e866 drell  yan asymmetry and @xmath95 asymmetry measurements involve drell  yan production on deuterium , as well as hydrogen , targets . ] data . however , in the global fit , all of these data sets are well described , implying that isospin symmetry breaking is small .",
    "this may be illustrated as follows .",

    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "there is a slight decrease in the value of @xmath48 with increasing @xmath22 , but the effect of this on the higgs cross section is completely outweighed by the large increase in the gluon in the relevant @xmath13 range .",

    "[ fig : hlhc ] that , when @xmath23 is increased to @xmath172 , corresponding to our conservative set of nlo partons , the higgs cross section is only increased by 1% .",

    "this arises because the @xmath12 cut of @xmath172 eliminates the nmc @xmath174 data for @xmath175 , which prefer a steeper rise of @xmath176 with @xmath12 , and hence a larger gluon in this range ( as well as a larger value of @xmath48 ) .",
    "nevertheless the value for the ` conservative ' set represents a non - negligible increase in the higgs cross section compared to the prediction of the default set .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : wtev ] we also see that the nlo prediction for the cross section for @xmath4 production at the tevatron also rises steadily as @xmath22 is increased , saturating at an increase of about 2% for @xmath177 .",

    "again , when we also impose @xmath178 the predicted value of the cross section decreases .",
    "the increased value of @xmath179 allows the input quarks to be larger for @xmath180 ( too large for the nmc data now cut out ) , and the improvement in the quality of the fit requires less increase in @xmath181 .",

    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig : htev ] and [ fig : wtev ] that the predictions for @xmath4 and @xmath166 production at the tevatron are much more stable to variations of @xmath22 .",
    "the reason is that the increased evolution of quarks for @xmath186 , due to the nnlo contributions to the splitting and coefficient functions , requires much less change in the gluon , and consequently in @xmath187 in this range .",
    "the additional imposition of @xmath188 , however , reduces the higgs cross section significantly , by about 5% , even though at nnlo it leads to only a slight decrease in the value of @xmath48 .",
    "this is because the loss of the nmc @xmath174 data for @xmath175 below @xmath12 of @xmath172 has resulted in a large reduction in the gluon for @xmath189 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnlocon ] .",
    "the prediction for the @xmath4 cross section also falls , by about 1% , for the same reason as at nlo .",

    "as a consequence , the ` conservative ' parton predictions show slightly greater convergence with increased perturbative order , than the default predictions .    at the lhc , the cross sections for @xmath4 and @xmath166 production at central rapidity sample partons at @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively ,",

    "however , the _ total _ cross sections sample a wide range of rapidity , and in fact probe down to @xmath194 for @xmath4 production and @xmath195 for @xmath166 production , and hence the predictions using the ` conservative ' partons are not guaranteed to be reliable .",
    "we present such predictions to exhibit where the reliability does break down , and to what extent .",
    "we notice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hlhc ] ) that the predictions for the higgs cross section at the lhc are actually rather stable to changes in the value of @xmath22 at both nlo and nnlo . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fgluons ] this is not too surprising . at the high scales that are needed for higgs production , the nnlo gluon is hardly changed compared to the default .",

    "hence , there is only a slight increase in the prediction for the higgs cross section compared to the default .",
    "when the additional cut in @xmath12 is applied , in order to obtain the conservative sets , both the nlo and nnlo predictions decrease slightly due to the decreases in @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig : wlhc ] , the story is rather different . at nlo",
    "there is a steady , and rather dramatic decrease in the predicted cross section as @xmath22 is increased .",

    "the reason for this is clear from examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] . for the sets with @xmath196 the quark distributions for @xmath51",

    "also the gluon at small @xmath13 and low @xmath12 is reduced , and therefore the evolution of the quarks is slower than the default set . hence , although at @xmath201 the quarks at the central rapidity value of @xmath202 are actually much the same as in the default set , they quickly become reduced at smaller @xmath13 , and very much so for @xmath203 .",
    "however , much of the total cross section comes from @xmath4 rapidities corresponding to such low @xmath13 for one of the two quarks contributing to the reaction , and , as a consequence , the contribution to the cross section at high rapidities is much reduced .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wrap ] , which shows the differential cross section as a function of the @xmath4 rapidity . at central rapidity ,",
    "the cross section is even increased slightly , but it falls away very quickly with increasing @xmath204 , resulting in the @xmath199 loss for the total . however , at nnlo there is far greater stability .",
    "there is a slight decrease in predicted cross section with increasing @xmath22 , which can be understood from the small decrease in the quarks for @xmath13 in the region 0.00010.005 , as compared to the default set , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnlocon ] .",
    "however , as we have already commented for the gluon , the change in the very low @xmath13 partons with increasing @xmath22 is very much reduced at nnlo , because the nnlo contributions themselves include important corrections to the small-@xmath13 behaviour of the partons and structure functions .",
    "we believe that the variation of the predicted cross sections with the value of @xmath22 and @xmath23 gives a rough indication of the theoretical uncertainty due to the parton distributions . from the nnlo prediction for the cross section for @xmath4 production at the tevatron , we see from fig .

    "this gives a _ total _ error of about @xmath2052% , which would imply that observing the @xmath4 production rate at the tevatron ( and comparing with the nnlo prediction ) could serve as a valuable luminosity monitor .",
    "the theoretical error , from the partons , for nnlo higgs production at the tevatron is rather larger ( about 5% ) , due to the adjustment of the gluon over the whole @xmath13 range and changes in @xmath151 , when the input assumptions to the fit are varied .",
    "the variation at the lhc is relatively small for the higgs cross section , which does not probe partons at too low @xmath13 , and is swamped by the higher - order corrections to the partonic cross section .",

    "cross section at the lhc at nlo implies that important theoretical corrections are required .",
    "the reduction of this variation to @xmath206 at nnlo implies than much of this correction has occurred in going from nlo to nnlo .",

    "this disagrees with our predictions by @xmath208 , which is larger than the total quoted error in @xcite ( @xmath209 for the tevatron and @xmath116 for the lhc ) .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is almost certainly due to the absence of a number of sets of data which determine the precise form of the quark distributions in the partonic fit  @xcite that is used .",
    "hence , in our spirit of determining parton distributions , we would deem this to be a removable discrepancy . ]",
    "the results in section 4 imply that even at nnlo additional theoretical precision could be obtained by further theoretical corrections , e.g. a correct inclusion of @xmath1 terms at higher orders",

    "we found that this was best achieved by imposing separate cuts on @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath26 of the data fitted .",
    "* for @xmath26 , stability was achieved by raising the cut from our default value of @xmath211 to just @xmath32 . however , in the region of low @xmath26 , we noted that there exists some incompatibility between the data sets . * for @xmath13 ,",
    "stability was achieved only for the relatively high value of @xmath212 . when this cut was applied , the gluon distribution above this @xmath13 value increased , relative to the default set , at the expense of the loss of the gluon at smaller @xmath13 .",
    "this improved the quality of the fit to the tevatron jet data , and also to the structure function data for @xmath213 due to an increase in @xmath187 .",
    "the @xmath214 required was the same at nnlo as at nlo , but the modification of the gluon was considerably smaller at nnlo . * for @xmath12",
    ", stability is reached for @xmath21510  @xmath216 at both nlo and nnlo , the convergence to stability being quite gradual as @xmath179 is raised .",
    "the slow convergence indicates that higher - order corrections , rather than higher - twist effects , are important at relatively low @xmath12 .    at both nlo and nnlo we also considered combinations of the above types of cuts .",
    "thus we found the full kinematic region where fixed - order dglap analysis is appropriate , together with the corresponding sets of conservative partons . at nlo",
    "the domain is given by @xmath38 , @xmath217 and @xmath47 , whereas at nnlo it is given by @xmath38 , @xmath218 and @xmath47 . , but raising @xmath30 to @xmath32 has a negligible effect on the partons .",
    "] within these regions these conservative sets of partons are most reliable , but should not be used outside the domain .",
    "indeed , outside the region they may be completely incompatible with the data . however , we note that , although the nlo and nnlo regions of stability are similar , the nnlo partons are far closer to the default partons outside the stable domain , indicating smaller theoretical uncertainty at nnlo .",
    "complementary to the above empirical study , we also made an explicit investigation of the following variety of possible theoretical corrections .",
    "* higher - order parametric @xmath1 corrections to the splitting functions were found to improve the quality of the fit .",
    "this occurs both at small @xmath13 , as expected , and also at larger @xmath13 where the partons are allowed to re - adjust to a form similar to that of the conservative parton set ( with @xmath219 ) .",
    "the required corrections were not the same at nnlo as at nlo , being overall a little smaller at nnlo , reflecting the important small @xmath13 contributions introduced at nnlo . *",
    "shadowing ( or absorptive ) corrections were introduced , but found to have little effect when the default partons were used as the starting point . if the input gluon was forced to be even very slowly increasing at small @xmath13 , then evolution is too rapid even with shadowing corrections included .",
    "further study would require the simultaneous description of diffractive structure function data .",
    "* parametric higher - twist contributions were introduced and quantified .",
    "these decreased as we progressed to higher perturbative order , and , at nnlo , were only evident for @xmath220 .",
    "however , at both nlo and nnlo , the change in the input partons is similar to that invoked by increasing @xmath179 .",
    "the high @xmath13 , or equivalently low @xmath26 , higher - twist contribution is intrinsically related to the @xmath2 resummation .",
    "this is because the latter is inherently divergent and the ambiguity in the perturbation series must cancel that in the higher - twist contribution .",
    "we found that the effect of the well - determined nnnlo high @xmath13 contribution was important , and reduced the high @xmath13 , higher - twist contribution still further .",
    "however this nnnlo contribution demarks the perturbative order beyond which the series fails to converge .",
    "hence we conclude that resummation beyond nnnlo becomes indistinguishable from higher - twist corrections at high @xmath13 .    as well as",
    "the theoretical corrections to the standard dglap evolution there are other potential sources of uncertainty in the fitting procedure . among these we considered the following .",
    "* we found our input parameterization was sufficiently flexible to accommodate the data , and indeed there is a certain redundancy evident .",
    "hence we conclude that the form of our parameterization does not significantly constrain the description , though a more efficient parameterization may be possible .",
    "allowing our input gluon to be negative at small @xmath13 does have important consequences however . *",
    "heavy - target corrections are required when fitting to neutrino data .",
    "we found that , although our default choice was not quite optimum , changes resulted in different data sets becoming more compatible with each other , and led to only minimal changes in the partons . * shadowing corrections are also required when fitting to deuterium structure functions .",
    "we found that there was a small amount of evidence for some high @xmath13 shadowing , and that the uncertainty in valence partons , particularly @xmath79 at high @xmath13 , due to the model uncertainty in deuterium shadowing is similar to the uncertainty due to the experimental errors on the data .",
    "* the input strange quark sea distribution is parameterized as @xmath221 , where the default choice was @xmath222 . we found that both the global fit and the description of the ccfr dimuon data prefer a smaller value of @xmath223 .",
    "this choice , which gives a smaller strange sea distribution and slightly larger @xmath224 , will be implemented in future fits .",
    "however it leads to only very small changes in most physical quantities .",
    "* the possibility of isospin violations was investigated in both the sea and valence quark sectors . in the former case , we found an that increase of @xmath225 ( and a corresponding decrease of @xmath226 ) , in comparison to the default set , was preferred by the data at the 8% level .",
    "in fact the acceptable range of @xmath227 allowed an increase up to 18% and a decrease down to 8% .",
    "for the valence quarks there was no significant improvement in the fit due to possible isospin violations , though a slight preference for @xmath228 and @xmath229 at high @xmath13 was noted .",
    "changes in @xmath230 of up to @xmath231 were permitted . from conservation of quark number",
    "the percentage violation for @xmath232 is half that for @xmath230 . for both valence and sea quarks",
    "the consequent change in the proton distributions in the isospin - violating sets of partons is always 2% or less .",
    "we observed that the possible isospin violation was certainly sufficient to account for the nutev @xmath233 anomaly , and that the slight preference in the type of violation for valence quarks is indeed in the correct direction to reduce this anomaly .",
    "we also discussed the possibility that @xmath234 , noting that other studies have indicated a small inequality , the most recent of these again being in the correct direction to help resolve the nutev @xmath233 anomaly .",
    "we note that the most significant theoretical errors come from possible corrections to the fixed - order dglap framework . hence within the region of applicability",
    ", the conservative partons are the most reliable , and the variation of partons , and of physical observables , under changes in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , give some indication of the theoretical uncertainties , both inside and outside the conservative domain .",
    "the most reliable extractions of @xmath48 therefore follow from the conservative fits and are equal to _ s^nlo(m_z^2 )  =  0.1165 0.002(expt ) 0.003(theory ) , _",
    "s^nnlo(m_z^2 )  =  0.1153 0.002(expt ) 0.003(theory ) . in the nlo case",
    "this is considerably below our default determination , showing that the increase in @xmath151 is mimicking theoretical corrections beyond nlo dglap .    as additional tests of theoretical stability",
    ", we examined @xmath4 and higgs cross sections at the tevatron and the lhc . at the tevatron",
    "we only sample partons in the conservative domain .",
    "nevertheless the nlo predictions vary significantly as @xmath22 and @xmath23 are changed due to the re - adjustment of the partons .",
    "the nnlo predictions are much more stable , implying less theoretical uncertainty at nnlo .",
    "indeed , the estimated total theoretical and experimental uncertainty of about @xmath2052% on @xmath191 at the tevatron offers an attractive and precise luminosity monitor .    for non - central @xmath4 and higgs production at the lhc , we probe partons below the conservative @xmath196 . for @xmath190 ,",
    "which samples the gluon not too much lower than @xmath235 , we still have reasonable stability , especially at nnlo . on the other hand @xmath191 samples",
    "quarks further below @xmath235 and the nlo prediction can vary by up to 20% with different choices of cuts .",
    "this implies that the theoretical uncertainty at small @xmath13 at nlo is rather large .",
    "however , at nnlo , @xmath191 is much more stable ( varying by about 3% ) , suggesting that the theoretical uncertainty has been considerably reduced by the inclusion of nnlo splitting and coefficient functions .",
    "we hope to confirm that this is still the case when the complete nnlo splitting functions become available .",
    "assuming that this is so , the total theoretical and experimental uncertainty at the lhc is about @xmath2054% .",
    "therefore again it can serve as a good luminosity monitor .",
    "work on resummations may be able to reduce the theoretical uncertainty still further .",
    "therefore we conclude that theoretical uncertainties can be dominant in some kinematic regions , especially when the physical quantity probes partons at small @xmath13 and/or small @xmath12 .",
    "there seems to be considerable advantage in working at nnlo , as compared to nlo , but for real precision a few observables may have to await theoretical developments in low @xmath13 and/or low @xmath12 physics .",
