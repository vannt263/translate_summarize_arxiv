    "the correlation of qso emission line properties with luminosity is a straightforward yet potentially highly informative test of standard physical models for agn . since the discovery of an anti - correlation between the equivalent width ( @xmath9 ) of the  1549 emission line and continuum luminosity ( @xmath10 ) by baldwin ( 1977 ) ,",
    "a significant amount of effort has been expended quantifying this relationship ( hereinafter referred to as the baldwin effect ) , and investigating similar correlations with other qso emission lines ( baldwin , wampler & gaskell 1989 ; zamorani et al .",
    "1992 ; green , forster & kuraszkiewcz 2001 ) .",
    "the results have revealed that the anti - correlation with luminosity is relatively weak , typically @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and large scatter .",
    "similar correlations have been seen in most other broad emission lines including  2798 ,  1909 , + ] 1400 and  with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it has also been claimed @xcite that the baldwin effect may be dominated by an even stronger anti - correlation with redshift .",
    "however , in the magnitude - limited qso samples that have been studied to date , it is extremely difficult to disentangle the effects of redshift and luminosity .",
    "it it typically only possible to access 11.5 magnitudes at any given redshift , given the steep slope of the qso luminosity function for magnitude - limited samples with @xmath14 ( boyle , shanks & peterson 1988 ) .",
    "a further limitation of existing studies is that it is difficult to study the correlation with luminosity and/or redshift for weaker lines , in particular the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the spectra used in such analyses are typically survey quality , i.e. relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath15 ) and thus narrow emission lines can be difficult to detect in individual spectra .",
    "composite qso spectra have been generated from most large qso surveys over the past decade @xcite , providing a detailed picture of the ensemble average spectral properties of the qso sample .",
    "typical @xmath16s in these spectra approach or even exceed 100 , with even relatively weak emission lines ( e.g.  3426 ) easily detectable .",
    "however , previous surveys have been too small ( comprising 1000 qsos or less ) to generate composite spectra as a function of both luminosity and redshift with which to examine correlations . with the recent advent of much larger qso surveys such as the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz , croom et al .",
    "2001 ) and and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , vanden berk et al .  2001 ; schneider et al.2002 ) we may now use composite , rather than individual spectra , to investigate the correlation of qso spectral properties with luminosity and redshift in much greater detail that has hitherto been possible .    in this paper we describe the result of an analysis of composite qso spectra based on the almost 22000 qsos observed to date ( january 2002 ) in the 2qz .",
    "the bulk of these objects lie around the break in the luminosity function , thus providing a better sampling in luminosity at any given redshift than qso surveys at the bright end of the lf ( e.g. the large bright quasar survey ; hewett , foltz & chaffee 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , we have also included a few hundred brighter qsos observed with the new 6-degree field ( 6df ) multi - object spectrographic facility on the uk schmidt telescope ( croom et al . in preparation ) to increase the luminosity range studied at any given redshift to typically 34 magnitudes . as well as providing a wide baseline over which to study correlations such as the baldwin effect",
    ", this sampling of the qso @xmath17 plane provides an opportunity to disentangle the effects of luminosity and redshift .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data used in our analysis , while in section 3 we discuss the methods used to generate the composite spectra and measure the spectral line equivalent widths . in section 4",
    "we present the results of our analysis , we then discuss these in the context of theoretical models in section 5 .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      given that the above analysis appears to suggest that the dominant correlation is with @xmath18 we now derive correlations between @xmath19 with @xmath18 for the composites sub - divided only on the basis of luminosity ( fig . [ fig_lumcomp ] ) .",
    "this can potentially reduce the noise and scatter in the correlations if @xmath9 is truly only correlated with @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting correlations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_magbincorr ] .",
    "the correlation coefficients and best fit parameters are listed in table [ table_corrfitmagbin ] . we see evidence of significant correlations in many lines , with some exceptions .",
    "the lines which do not show correlations are , , , ,  and .",
    "we also note that in some cases , most notably , +  and , the dispersion about the best fit correlation is much larger than would be expected give the errors on individual points .",
    "this suggests that other parameters may cause extra dispersion in the relation , or that a simple power law fit is not actually a good description of the underlying physics .",
    "we now attempt to understand the above measured correlations in the context of simple physical models for agn emission and host galaxy properties . we will start by considering the host galaxy , and then look at the narrow line and broad line regions in turn .",
    "the  absorption line is possibly the most simple to interpret , as it can only be due to the stars present in the host galaxy of the qso .",
    "we clearly see that as the agn luminosity increases , the strength of the  declines , consistent with a picture in which the host galaxy does not increase in luminosity as fast as does the agn . if the host galaxy was constant in luminosity , the slope of the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath18 would be 0.4 .",
    "our best fit slope is @xmath20 , which is therefore consistent with host galaxy luminosity increasing slowly . in this analysis",
    "we make the assumption that the average spectral properties of the agn host galaxies do not change significantly with luminosity ( or redshift ) .",
    "we also assume that there is no significant aperture effect introduced by the 2-arcsec diameter of the 2df fibres used to obtain the spectra .",
    "based on the imaging results of schade , boyle & letawsky ( 2000 ) , we expect that galaxy hosts for qsos in this luminosity range ( @xmath21 ) will be bulge - dominated with effective radii ranging from 1  2kpc for qsos at @xmath22 and 3  6kpc for qsos with @xmath23 . in both cases",
    "the projected size of the bulges are is approximately the same size on the sky ( @xmath24 0.75 ",
    "1.5-arcsec diameter ) and significantly less than the fibre diameter .",
    "if we also assume that the majority of the continuum emission is due to the qso , we can derive a simple relation for the expected correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath18 .",
    "we can set @xmath25 , that is , the qso luminosity is proportional to the host galaxy luminosity to some power . if @xmath26 then the host galaxy has a constant luminosity . converting to magnitude and @xmath19",
    "we then find @xmath27 taking our fitted value for the slope of the correlation we find that @xmath28 .",
    "this then implies that qso and host galaxy luminosity are correlated .",
    "this has in fact been found from direct imaging studies of qso host galaxies .",
    "schade et al . ( 2000 ) find @xmath29 for a sample of low redshift x - ray selected agn , with large scatter .",
    "this is a somewhat shallower slope than we find , however , we are in fact deriving the slope for the relation @xmath30 , not @xmath31 . we can instead construct a model which assumes an exact power law correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "however this does depend on us having some knowledge of the expected equivalent width for  in the host galaxy , without the agn component .",
    "we can not make an accurate assessment of the spectral properties of the host galaxy , as we have only fit one feature .",
    "instead we use a  line strength derived from the mean galaxy spectrum in the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "this has an equivalent width for  of @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum @xmath9 found for  in our analysis is @xmath35 , thus at the faintest luminosities the the host galaxy could be contributing a significant fraction of the continuum . if the equivalent width of the line in the galaxy spectrum is @xmath36 , then @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the absolute b - band magnitudes from the total ( agn+host ) and host components .",
    "assuming a linear relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that @xmath41 implies that @xmath42 which can be solved numerically for @xmath39 , and substituted into eq .",
    "[ eq_ca2 ] .",
    "the resulting best fit is @xmath43 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ca2 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "this fit is very similar to the previous power law fit ( dotted line ) , only diverging at faint magnitudes .",
    "also plotted is the relation found by schade et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of @xmath44 , this is clearly discrepant with our data . reducing the intrinsic strength of  to @xmath45  does not remove this discrepancy .",
    "we note that schade et al . have demonstrated that for low redshift agn ( @xmath46 ) at about @xmath47 the host galaxies are in almost all respects no different to normal galaxies .",
    "the one difference found is a bias towards spheroidal morphologies .",
    "this could imply that the stellar populations in agn host galaxies are older than in average galaxies , but this is by no means certain given that agn activity could also be accompanied by enhanced star formation .",
    "it is also possible to use the measured  line together with a mean galaxy spectrum to determine the expected spectral properties of other features not produced by the agn , in particular , the narrow forbidden oxygen emission lines . in the mean 2df galaxy redshift survey spectrum",
    "the flux emitted in  5007 is about a factor of two lower that the flux absorbed in .",
    "however , even in our faintest composites where the host galaxies contribute the most , the  line has an @xmath9 a factor of over 4 greater than .",
    "thus , assuming that the host galaxy sed is similar to that of a normal galaxy implies that the  emission is coming from the agn , rather than the host galaxy .",
    "the situation regarding the  3727 line is different . in the mean galaxy spectrum",
    "the line has a relative flux which is similar to that in the  line , and has an equivalent width of @xmath48 . comparing the correlations of  and",
    "we find that close to the faint end of the distribution , at @xmath49 , the  @xmath9 is 70100% of what would be predicted from the host galaxy .",
    "as the  correlation with @xmath9 is flatter than that of the simple assumption of a constant host galaxy sed would predicit that the increased fraction of the  flux is emanating from the agn at higher luminosities ( @xmath50% at @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , the difference is not as large as in the case of the  line and it is possible to speculate that the  line is formed in powerful star - forming regions and the star - formation rate in the host galaxy is increasing with agn luminosity . in this case",
    ", all the  emission could be due to the host galaxy .",
    "the  line would then provide a very useful diagnostic tool for the study of star formation in high redshift qsos .",
    "a further test of this would be to investigate the velocity distribution of the different narrow lines . if , for example , the  line has a significantly lower velocity dispersion , more consistent with typical galaxies , than this would be good evidence of for the  being due mostly to the host galaxy .",
    "here we proceed by assuming that a major fraction of the  line emission originates in the nlr of the agn .",
    "the former possibility of the starburst origin will be investigated further by corbett et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the lines that are thought to be emitted within the nlr of the agn are , ,  and  ( see however comment about  in the previous section ) .",
    "of those , only  and  show clear and significant correlations with @xmath18 .",
    "the partial correlation anaylsis for both lines is consistent with the hypothesis that the correlation is solely due to variations in @xmath18 , with no correlation with redshift .",
    "the slope of the  correlation for the magnitude only divided composites is @xmath52 , consistent with the correlation found in the @xmath53 composites , which has a slope of @xmath54 .",
    "this line has the highest ionization potential ( here and below we consider the lower ionization potential ; the energy required to ionize the lower ionization ion ) of any of the narrow lines we investigate ( 126.21  ev ) .",
    "the  line has the lowest ionization potential and the other two have intermediate values : 63.45  ev for   and 54.93  ev for .",
    "the  line shows only a marginal detection of a correlation ( 97% significant ) and has a significantly flatter slope , @xmath55 .",
    "the line shows no evidence of a correlation and all the measured equivalent widths in the @xmath18 composites are within a range of @xmath56 . plotting the measured slope as a function of ionization energy for these narrow lines ( open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig_ionslope ] ) we see no obvious trend",
    ". however , if much of the  emission is due to star formation , as suggested in the earlier section , there may be a correlation in a sense that a steeper slope corresponds to higher ionization energy . given the small number of points and the additional assumption about , we can not use this trend to infer the nlr physics .",
    "previous analyses have tentitively detected correlations between narrow line strength and luminosity @xcite . however , these were generally in data sets with a large fraction of non - detections , as they used single objects instead of composite spectra .",
    "the suggested correlation of line intensity with luminosity in  demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] does not appear to be borne out in the correlation analysis involving equivalent width measurements .",
    "the apparent variation could be due to a real variation in the velocity width of the  lines while the total flux remains approximately constant .    a simple interpretation of the  and  correlation involves the disappearing nlr model",
    "this idea is based on the fact that the nlr size scales with the source luminosity to some power @xmath57 which is reasonable given the similar correlation found for the broad line region ( blr ) @xcite and the actual observed nlr size in a number of sources .",
    "luminosity scaling suggests @xmath58 where the lowest value is obtained from the similarity of the narrow line spectrum in low and high luminosity agn ( e.g. netzer 1990 ) and the @xmath59 is the value obtained by kaspi at al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the blr . for nearby low luminosity seyfert 1s , @xmath60  pc .",
    "thus , the 5 magnitude range in @xmath18 observed in our sample translates to @xmath61  kpc for the highest luminosity agn , i.e. the scale of the entire galaxy , and indeed , recent hst imaging of the nlr in several radio - loud quasars shows equation ( 9 ) to hold for r@xmath62 up to @xmath2410 kpc with @xmath63=0.5 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the nlr gas , if was there in the first place , has long left the galaxy and most high luminosity agn contain weak or non - existent nlrs .",
    "moreover , if @xmath59 as suggested here , and if the nlr density is independent of size , we can perhaps explain the decreasing equivalent width of  as due to a decreasing ionization parameter with luminosity .    the  @xmath9 correlation with luminosity is marginal although with the right trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig_magbincorr ] ) .",
    "however , the above simplified model does not explain the different behaviour of the  line that shows no obvious correlation .",
    "we note , however , that the ,  and  lines are measured over a larger magnitude range , compared with , because the  lines are lost off the red end of the spectrum at much lower redshifts ( and hence lower luminosities in a flux limited sample ) than the other emission lines .",
    "thus , the reality of the model will have to be tested when more line measurements of higher luminosity agn are available . needless to say ,",
    "if the model suggested here is confirmed by future observation , it will have serious implications for searches for luminous _ type 2 _ qsos which simply may not have luminous narrow emission line regions .",
    "lastly we consider emission from the blr .",
    "most of the strong emission lines we analyze emanate from this region and we will discuss each of the lines in turn .    the  line is the only one to show a clear correlation with redshift ( top left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_zcorr ] ) .",
    "we see an increase in strength with redshift .",
    "however , this is likely to be due to a combination of increased  forest absorption and our normalization of the continuum .",
    "as we have no knowledge of the continuum shape of our spectra , we can not extrapolate a power law slope from the red to the blue side of .",
    "thus , if absorption increases , our continuum point on the blue side of the line will be increasingly depressed , resulting in an over - estimate of the line flux",
    ". the  line , close to  will also be effected by this problem , and is generally dominated by the errors in subtracting the  components .",
    "previous work @xcite has found correlations between the strength of and redshift , with higher redshift qsos having weaker .",
    "francis & koratkar attribute this largely to an increase in  forest absorption in their flux calibrated spectra . in our composite spectra , which are continuum divided",
    ", this same  forest absorption causes an underestimate of the continuum level .",
    "this in turn produces the positive correlation of @xmath9 with redshift .",
    "the + ] lines had to be fit as one feature , as they could not be de - blended .",
    "apart from this they are relatively clear of contamination .",
    "this blend shows no evidence whatsoever for any correlation with luminosity , with equivalent widths which are constant to @xmath64% over a factor of @xmath65 in luminosity .",
    "this is in disagreement with green et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who find a significant correlation with @xmath66 .",
    "we find a shallower slope which is consistent with zero .",
    "we note that green et al .",
    "measure their correlation over a range which is only a factor of @xmath67 in luminosity .",
    "the  line shows a highly significant correlation of equivalent width with luminosity , @xmath68 . the blend ( ,  and )",
    "correlation is flatter , with @xmath69 .",
    "however , this blend also shows apparent significant correlations with redshift which could be , in some part , due to the combination of lines taken . for , we find @xmath70 with significant departures away from the correlation at low luminosity , @xmath71 . checks of the individual line fits show no obvious systematic problems , and it appears that these deviations from the simple power law are real .",
    "if they were also present in the  or  lines and occurred at the same luminosity we would not see the effect as the faintest qsos which have these lines visible are too bright ( @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) .",
    "an alternative cause is a change in the sed , e.g. of the host galaxy , but this effect is not seen in the narrow  emission line which spans a similar range in luminosity .",
    "however , we also note that the  emission line lies on top of the broad  emission feature which we have treated as continuum .",
    "this  emission may contribute a significant proportion ( @xmath2425% ) of this continuum emission and hence any variation in the strength of the emission as a function of luminosity will affect the  equivalent width measurements .",
    "perhaps the biggest surprise of this analysis is the balmer line correlation which is markedly different to that of the broad uv emission lines .",
    "although the broad  line shows no significant correlation , the equivalent widths of the  and  lines show a _ positive _ correlation with luminosity .",
    "there is a hint that the strength of the correlation increases for lower order balmer lines with @xmath74 and @xmath75 for  and  respectively .",
    "this _ inverse baldwin effect _ has not been seen before .",
    "note that for the  line we included the narrow component and the  4363 line in the equivalent width , while for  we subtract of the narrow component .",
    "however , the positive correlations with luminosity remain if the narrow component is subtracted from the emission line or the narrow component is included .",
    "we plot the measured slopes of equivalent width dependence on luminosity against the ionization potential ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig_ionslope ] ) for all the major emission lines in this study . excluding the  line , which could be contaminated by emission from the host galaxy , we see a correlation between the slope of the baldwin relation and the ionization potential .",
    "a possible explanation for this effect is that the sed of the ionizing continuum may steepen towards lower energies with increasing luminosity , resulting in more photons being available to ionize hydrogen but relatively fewer with energies greater than 64ev available to ionize .",
    "alternatively , the ionization parameter may change as a function of luminosity , as discussed below .    on the other hand ,",
    "the correlations we measure between equivalent width and luminosity may be caused by changes in the continuum flux under the lines rather than the line flux itself .",
    "we plot the slope of the equivalent width dependence on luminosity vs. the rest wavelength of the features in question ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lamslope ] ) . in this case",
    ", there may be a trend for the slope of the baldwin relation to increase with decreasing wavelength .",
    "however , the broad lines show a much flatter correlation with wavelength than the narrow lines ( even excluding ) ; arguing against an effect caused by simple continuum variation .",
    "our results imply that either ( a ) l()/l ( ) increases with luminosity , ( b ) l(4860)/l(1550 ) decreases with luminosity or a combination of the two .",
    "we have no way of directly answering this question since our data are not flux calibrated and we can not measure the above luminosity ratios .",
    "however , we can refer to earlier findings discussing the line and continuum luminosities in smaller , less complete samples .",
    "earlier studies of agn seds ( e.g. vanden berk et al . 2001 and references therein ) show that the slope of the power law continuum changes dramatically near to the  and  lines .",
    "blue - wards of about 4500  the continuum slope has @xmath76 , while red - wards of this point the slope is more like @xmath77 .",
    "this has been interpreted as due to the different continuum processes contributing to the sed at different wavelengths @xcite . at short wavelengths",
    "most of the emission is due to accretion disks ( e.g. laor & netzer 1989 , and references therein ) while at longer wavelengths dust emission , combined with non - thermal emission in radio - loud sources , is more important . having this in mind we can speculate that the relative contribution is luminosity dependent in a sense that the accretion disk contribution is more important at long wavelengths in higher luminosity sources .",
    "this is exactly the trend observed by laor ( 1990 ) in his study of the continuum emission in high luminosity agn .",
    "other ideas are related to the accretion disk inclination @xcite , changes in the ionizing luminosity as a function of luminosity @xcite ( considered above ) or emission by optically thin gas @xcite .",
    "most of these models predict a similar trend for all lines albeit with a different slope . no existing model , except for the one involving changes in the relative luminosity of the two components ,",
    "can explain the observed difference between  and .",
    "another possibility is to test the dependence of optical and uv line ratios , such as l()/l ( ) , on luminosity and continuum shape as was done for example by netzer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for a small ( 20 ) sample of radio loud agn .",
    "that study shows a clear correlation of l()/l ( ) with l(4861)/l(1216 ) .",
    "however the small size of the sample , and the small luminosity range , prevents any clear conclusion .",
    "finally , we note that the  luminosity range and the luminosity range are very different , with almost no overlap , because of the @xmath78 correlation in our sample .",
    "it is therefore possible that the _ real _ baldwin relationship for _ all lines _ is more complicated than previously assumed , showing both rising and falling branches .",
    "this may be related to the unusual shape of the @xmath79 curve of the  line seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_magbincorr ] .",
    "this idea can only be studied by obtaining good  measurements in high luminosity agn .",
    "we have used composite qso spectra to make the most accurate determination of line and continuum correlations to date .",
    "we see the baldwin effect in a number of lines . in general the equivalent width correlations",
    "are primarily with luminosity and not redshift .",
    "the broad uv lines generally show strong anti - correlations with luminosity , although somewhat flatter than previous determinations .",
    "the balmer line equivalent widths , in contrast , show an inverse baldwin effect , and are positively correlated with luminosity .",
    "we postulate that this difference could be due to a different combination of disk and non - disk components in agn of different luminosity .",
    "some , but not all , narrow forbidden lines also show anti - correlations with luminosity .",
    "a possible explanation is that the nlr becomes more extended , and fainter by comparison , at high luminosity .",
    "this has important implications concerning the possible detection of type 2 qsos at high redshifts . by comparing the strength of the  absorption line to the  emission line via a mean galaxy spectrum",
    "we find that at low luminosities most , if not all , of the  flux could come from the host galaxy and not the agn .",
    "this raises the possibility that a large fraction of the observed  in high luminosity agn is due to enhanced nuclear star - formation . using the  line and assuming a constant sed for the host galaxy , we are able to derive the correlation between host galaxy and agn luminosity which is @xmath80 .    a number of areas have still to be investigated .",
    "first is the detailed shapes and positions of the lines , which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( corbett et al . in preparation ) .",
