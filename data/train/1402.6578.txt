    "recently a new charged charmoniumlike state , the @xmath8 , was observed by the belle  @xcite and besiii  @xcite experiments in a study of @xmath9 at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies around 4.26  gev .",
    "it was soon confirmed with the cleo data at a cm energy of 4.17 gev  @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath8 state has a strong coupling to charmonium and is charged , it can not be a conventional charmonium state .",
    "this observation has stimulated a number of distinct interpretations .",
    "these include a tetraquark state  @xcite , @xmath10 molecule  @xcite , hadroquarkonium  @xcite , and other configurations  @xcite .",
    "more recently , besiii observed another charged charmoniumlike state , @xmath11 , in @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "these states , together with similar states observed in the bottomonium system  @xcite , indicate the existence of a new class of hadrons .",
    "a strange partner of the @xmath13 , called @xmath14 , may exist in the above scenarios .",
    "the mass of a @xmath15 @xmath16 molecular state was first predicted  @xcite using qcd sum rules with @xmath17  gev/@xmath18 , which is very close to the @xmath19 threshold of 3.976  gev/@xmath18 . using the same qcd sum rules , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the decay widths of the @xmath20 to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 , assuming the @xmath14 to be a tetraquark state .",
    "such a state is also predicted in the single - kaon emission model  @xcite .    using a data sample of 673  fb@xmath2 collected at or near @xmath24  gev , belle has observed abundant @xmath7 signal events via initial state radiation ( isr )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is one very broad structure in the @xmath25 mass spectrum ; fits using either a single breit - wigner ( bw ) function , or the @xmath26 plus a second bw function yield resonant parameters that are very different from those of the currently tabulated excited @xmath27 states  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath28 distribution is not shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the updated measurement of the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 between threshold and 6.0  gev/@xmath18 and examine possible resonant structures in the cross section of the process @xmath0 as well as in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 systems .",
    "the results are based on the full belle data sample with an integrated luminosity of 980  fb@xmath2 collected on or near the @xmath3 ( @xmath41 , 2 , ... , 5 ) .",

    "we require four well reconstructed charged tracks with zero net charge .",
    "the impact parameters of these tracks perpendicular to and along the beam direction with respect to the interaction point are required to be less than 0.5  cm and 4.0  cm , respectively . for each charged track , a combined likelihood ratio from various detector subsystems is formed to identify different particle species ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "tracks with @xmath45 are identified as kaons with an efficiency of about 92% ; about 4% are misidentified pions  @xcite .",
    "similar ratios are also defined for leptons  @xcite . for electrons from @xmath46 ,",
    "one track should have @xmath47 and the other @xmath48 ; for muons from @xmath49 , at least one track should have @xmath50 ; in cases where the other has no muon identification ( @xmath51 ) , in order to suppress fake muon tracks , the cosine of the polar angle of each muon track in the @xmath52 cm frame is required to be less than 0.7 . events with @xmath53 conversions are removed by requiring @xmath54 for the @xmath30 tracks . in @xmath55 , @xmath53 conversion events are further suppressed by requiring the invariant mass of @xmath30 to be larger than 1.05  gev/@xmath18 ; this also removes the events with a @xmath56 meson in the final state . in @xmath49 , the invariant mass of @xmath30",
    "is required to be outside a @xmath57  mev/@xmath18 interval around the @xmath56 nominal mass to remove events with a @xmath56 meson in the final state , possibly produced via @xmath58 .",
    "there is only one combination of @xmath43 in each event after the above event selections .",
    "the isr events are identified by the requirement @xmath59  ( gev/@xmath18)@xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 represents the four - momentum of the corresponding particle in the @xmath31 cm frame .",
    "clear @xmath33 signals are observed in both @xmath55 and @xmath49 modes , as shown in fig .",
    "we define the @xmath33 signal region as @xmath63  gev/@xmath18 ( with the mass resolution of lepton pairs being about 17  mev/@xmath18 ) , and the @xmath33 mass sideband as @xmath64 or @xmath65  gev/@xmath18 , which is three times the width of the signal region . here ,",
