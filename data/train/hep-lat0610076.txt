    "light quarks chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures .",
    "chiral symmetry is restored in a chiral phase transition at finite temperature which separates the confined hadronic phase from the deconfined quark - gluon plasma . in qcd with heavy quarks , on the other hand , chiral symmetry",
    "is strongly broken explicitly and the @xmath6 center of the @xmath3 gauge group plays an important role @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the limit of infinite quark masses , i.e.  for @xmath3 yang - mills theory , the center becomes an exact discrete global symmetry . in this limit ,",
    "one finds a weak first order deconfinement phase transition with spontaneous breaking of the @xmath6 center symmetry in the high - temperature deconfined phase @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existence of an exact center symmetry necessarily implies the existence of a finite temperature deconfinement phase transition .",
    "quarks with a large ( but finite ) mass break the center symmetry explicitly , and hence the symmetry reason for the phase transition disappears . indeed , when the quark mass reaches typical qcd energy scales , the first order deconfinement phase transition is weakened further and turns into a crossover at a critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the role of the center symmetry for confinement and deconfinement ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . for this purpose , we study gauge theories with the exceptional gauge group @xmath2  the smallest simply connected group with a trivial center @xcite .",
    "the lie group @xmath2 has 14 generators .",
    "eight of them correspond to the 8 gluons of the @xmath3 subgroup .",
    "the other six gluons transform as @xmath7 and @xmath8 of @xmath3 and thus carry the same color quantum numbers as quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "indeed , just like the quarks in qcd , the extra gluons render the center of @xmath2 trivial by explicitly breaking the @xmath6 symmetry of the @xmath3 subgroup .",
    "due to the triviality of the center , a static @xmath2 quark in the fundamental @xmath4 representation can be screened by three @xmath2 gluons . as a consequence , the flux string connecting static @xmath2 quarks breaks already in the pure gauge theory by the creation of dynamical @xmath2 gluons .",
    "hence , the static potential levels off at large distances and the asymptotic string tension vanishes .",
    "still , just like full qcd , the theory remains confining even without an asymptotic string tension .",
    "this follows rigorously from the behavior of the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter @xcite in the strong coupling limit of lattice gauge theory @xcite and is expected to hold also in the continuum limit .",
    "it should be pointed out that in @xmath2 yang - mills theory the polyakov loop is no longer an order parameter for deconfinement . in particular , it is non - zero ( although very small ) already in the confined phase .",
    "this is another consequence of the fact that a @xmath2 quark can be screened by at least three @xmath2 gluons .    since the center of @xmath2 is trivial , in contrast to @xmath3 yang - mills theory , there is no symmetry reason for a deconfinement phase transition . in particular ,",
    "the low- and high - temperature regions could be connected by a smooth cross - over .",
    "however , one can not rule out a finite temperature phase transition . since there is no symmetry reason for such a transition , it is interesting to ask what dynamics may imply it .",
    "topological objects like instantons , merons , monopoles , or center vortices have often been invoked to address such questions @xcite .",
    "while instantons , merons , or monopoles still exist in @xmath2 gauge theory , due to the triviality of the center , twist sectors and the concept of center vortices do not apply here . in any case , irrespective of a particular topological object , the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath2 yang - mills theory may result from the large mismatch between the number of degrees of freedom in the low- and the high - temperature regimes @xcite . in the low - temperature phase",
    "the gluons are confined in color - singlet glueballs whose number is essentially independent of the gauge group . in the deconfined gluon plasma , on the other hand , these degrees of freedom are liberated and their number is determined by the number of generators of the gauge group . in particular , for a large gauge group there is a drastic change in the number of relevant degrees of freedom at low and high temperatures .",
    "this can cause a first order phase transition . indeed , while @xmath9-d @xmath10 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement phase transition in the universality class of the 3-d ising model , higher @xmath1 groups lead to first order transitions of a strength increasing with @xmath11 .",
    "however , while changing the size of the gauge group , one simultaneously changes the center @xmath0 and thus the possibly available universality class . in order to disentangle the effects of changing the size of the group and changing the center , @xmath12 yang - mills theories",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "all symplectic groups @xmath12 have the same center @xmath13 and thus , for symmetry reasons , a deconfinement phase transition must occur . for @xmath9-d @xmath14 yang - mills theory one",
    "finds the above - mentioned second order transition in the 3-d ising universality class . despite the fact that this universality class is available for all @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and most likely all other @xmath12 yang - mills theories have a first order deconfinement phase transition",
    "this shows that the order of the phase transition does not follow from the nature of the center ( which is @xmath13 for all @xmath11 ) but is a truly dynamical issue . while @xmath15 ( which has 10 generators ) leads to a weak first order phase transition , @xmath16 ( with 21 generators )",
    "has a much stronger transition .",
    "we attribute this to the larger number of liberated gluons in the deconfined phase of @xmath16 yang - mills theory .",
    "these arguments suggest that yang - mills theory with the gauge group @xmath2 ( which has 14 generators ) should also have a first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "indeed , in this paper we present numerical evidence for a first order deconfinement phase transition in @xmath2 yang - mills theory .",
    "first results on this subject have been published in @xcite .    since the gauge group @xmath3 has the nontrivial center @xmath6 , for symmetry reasons it must necessarily have a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "however , in contrast to the @xmath10 case , for @xmath3 no universality class seems to be available . in particular , the @xmath17-expansion does not reveal a @xmath6-symmetric fixed point .",
    "this led svetitsky and yaffe to conjecture that the deconfinement phase transition should be first order @xcite .",
    "indeed , monte carlo simulations of @xmath3 yang - mills theory on the lattice show a weak first order transition .",
    "similarly , the 3-d 3-state potts model also has a weak first order transition @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask if the first order deconfinement phase transition in @xmath3 yang - mills theory is again due to a large number of deconfined gluons , or if it is merely an unavoidable consequence of the nontrivial center symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we address this question by interpolating between @xmath3 and @xmath2 yang - mills theory . for this purpose",
    ", we spontaneously break @xmath2 down to @xmath3 with a higgs field in the fundamental @xmath4 representation .",
    "when the higgs field picks up a vacuum value @xmath5 , it gives mass to the 6 additional @xmath2 gluons , while the ordinary 8 @xmath3 gluons remain massless .",
    "the mass of the additional gluons increases with @xmath5 , such that for @xmath18 they are completely removed from the spectrum . in this limit",
    "the @xmath2 yang - mills - higgs theory reduces to @xmath3 yang - mills theory .",
    "the numerical simulations to be presented below result in the phase diagram of figure [ phasediag ] .",
    "the two axes correspond to the inverse gauge coupling @xmath19 and the hopping parameter @xmath20 of the fixed length higgs field in the @xmath4 representation .",
    "the simulations are performed at fixed euclidean time extent @xmath21 .",
    "hence , varying @xmath19 effectively changes the physical temperature . at @xmath22",
    "the @xmath2 yang - mills theory reduces to @xmath3 with its weak first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "as @xmath20 is lowered , in addition to the 8 @xmath3 gluons , 6 @xmath2 gluons of decreasing mass begin to participate in the dynamics . just like dynamical quarks and anti - quarks ,",
    "they transform in the @xmath7 and @xmath23 representation of @xmath3 and thus explicitly break the @xmath6 center symmetry . as in full qcd",
    ", this leads to a weakening of the deconfinement phase transition , which even seems to disappear at a critical endpoint . due to finite size effects",
    ", the location of the endpoint and even its existence can not be determined unambiguously from our monte carlo data .",
    "at @xmath24 we are in the pure @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "although @xmath2 has a trivial center , we find a clear first order phase transition . despite the fact that the polyakov loop is not a true order parameter , in the sense that it vanishes in the confined phase , it jumps from a very small non - zero value at low temperatures to a large value at high temperatures .",
    "hence , although the low- and high - temperature regions are not distinguished by different symmetry properties , the transition shares the important features of a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "of course , as we stressed before , in @xmath2 the low - temperature confined phase has string - breaking and thus no asymptotic string tension .",
    "we attribute the existence of the transition to the large mismatch between the number of the relevant degrees of freedom in the two phases .",
    "while there is a small number of glueball states at low temperatures , there are 14 deconfined @xmath2 gluons at high temperatures .",
    "as @xmath20 increases , at some point 6 @xmath2 gluons pick up a mass and are progressively removed from the dynamics .",
    "this reduces the mismatch in the number of degrees of freedom and implies a weakening of the @xmath2 deconfinement phase transition . again , due to finite size effects , the existence of a critical endpoint can not be derived unambiguously from our monte carlo data .",
    "the data suggest the existence of an endpoint and thus of a crossover region ( indicated in figure 1 by the dotted part of the line between the points a and b ) , but we can not rule out a very weak first order transition . in any case , the @xmath2 transition disappears ( or weakens substantially ) before the @xmath3 transition appears .",
    "this suggests that , unlike the @xmath2 transition , the @xmath3 transition is not due to a large mismatch in the number of relevant degrees of freedom . for @xmath3 , due to the nontrivial @xmath6 center symmetry , a deconfinement phase transition must exist .",
    "it is of first order because no universality class ( which should be visible in the @xmath17-expansion ) seems to be available .    at @xmath25",
    "the theory reduces to an @xmath26-invariant nonlinear @xmath27-model which shows spontaneous symmetry breaking down to @xmath28 at the critical point denoted by c in figure 1 .",
    "the dotted line emerging from this point is a crossover or perhaps a phase transition which we have not investigated in much detail . despite the fact that @xmath2 has a trivial center , in the deconfined phase there are metastable minima of the effective potential for the polyakov loop .",
    "although these minima are irrelevant in the infinite volume limit , they may influence the physics at finite volume . in order to correctly interpret the results of numerical simulations at high temperatures ,",
    "the existence of these metastable minima must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , they obscure the physics around the dotted line connected to c in figure [ phasediag ] .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic features of the group @xmath2 are discussed and @xmath2 gauge theories are introduced both in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "deconfinement in @xmath2 yang - mills theory is investigated and monte carlo results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 the 1-loop effective potential for the @xmath2 polyakov loop",
    "is derived analytically at high temperatures . in section 5 a higgs field",
    "is added in order to break @xmath2 down to @xmath3 and thus to investigate how the exceptional deconfinement of @xmath2 is related to the familiar deconfinement of @xmath3 yang - mills theory .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm for updating @xmath2 lattice gauge theory is described in an appendix .",
    "in this section we discuss some basic properties of the group @xmath2 , and construct @xmath2 yang - mills and gauge - higgs theories both in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "@xmath2 is the smallest among the exceptional lie groups @xmath2 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "it is physically interesting because it has a trivial center and contains the group @xmath3 as a subgroup .",
    "the group @xmath2 has rank 2 , 14 generators , and the fundamental representation is 7-dimensional . since @xmath2 is real it must be a subgroup of the rank 3 group @xmath26 which has 21 generators . the @xmath33 real orthogonal matrices @xmath34 of @xmath26 obey the constraint @xmath35 and have determinant 1 .",
    "the elements of @xmath2 satisfy the additional cubic constraint @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a totally anti - symmetric tensor whose non - zero elements follow by anti - symmetrization from @xmath38 restricting to the @xmath3 subgroup , the fundamental and adjoint @xmath2 representations are reducible and decompose as @xmath39 under the subgroup @xmath3 , 8 of the 14 @xmath2 gluons transform like ordinary gluons , i.e.  as an @xmath40 of @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining 6 @xmath2 gauge bosons break up into @xmath7 and @xmath41 and thus have the color quantum numbers of ordinary quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "although these objects are vector bosons , they have similar effects as quarks in full qcd .",
    "in particular , they explicitly break the @xmath6 center symmetry and make the center of @xmath2 trivial . due to the trivial center , the decomposition of the @xmath2 tensor product of three adjoint representations contains the fundamental representation @xmath42 as a consequence , three @xmath2 gluons can screen a single @xmath2 quark , and hence the flux string can break already in the pure gauge theory . further properties of the group @xmath2 can be found in @xcite .",

    "hence , we expect the first order deconfinement phase transition line to terminate at a critical endpoint before the additional @xmath2 gluons have become massless . as we further lower the mass of the additional 6 @xmath2 gluons by decreasing the value of the hopping parameter @xmath20 , a line of first order phase transitions ( connected to the deconfinement phase transition of @xmath2 yang - mills theory ) reemerges .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath3 transition , which is an unavoidable consequence of the nontrivial @xmath6 center symmetry , we attribute the @xmath2 transition to the large mismatch between the relevant degrees of freedom between the low- and the high - temperature regions . as 6 of the 14 @xmath2 gluons are progressively removed from the dynamics by the higgs mechanism , this mismatch becomes smaller and the reason for the phase transition disappears .    in the @xmath25",
    "limit the gauge degrees of freedom are frozen and the lattice theory reduces to the 4-d @xmath26 nonlinear @xmath27-model .",
    "this model has a second order phase transition that separates the symmetric phase at small values of @xmath20 from the @xmath122 broken phase at large @xmath20 . at large but finite values of @xmath19",
    "this transition is expected to extend to a line of first order transitions .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations on lattices with time extent @xmath21 and spatial sizes @xmath90 ranging from 14 to 24 , measuring the probability distribution of the polyakov loop . as discussed earlier , figure [ ymhist ] shows this distribution for the @xmath2 yang - mills theory in the region around the phase transition .",
    "the corresponding distributions in the @xmath2 gauge - higgs model are shown in figure [ critg2hym ] .",
    "-2.mm .05 cm ( a ) 4.cm ( b ) 4.cm ( c ) +    the three parts of figure [ critg2hym]a correspond to the same small value of @xmath123 at different temperatures ( i.e.  different values of @xmath19 ) . as in @xmath2 yang - mills theory , the polyakov loop is very small in the low - temperature confined region ( bottom panel in figure [ critg2hym]a ) .",
    "as we increase the temperature towards @xmath124 , a deconfined peak with a large value of the polyakov loop emerges ( middle panel in figure [ critg2hym]a ) , and finally at high temperatures the confined peak disappears ( top panel in figure [ critg2hym]a ) . at larger values of the hopping parameter ( @xmath125 )",
    "the situation is different .",
    "as displayed in figure [ critg2hym]b there is now only one peak ( although there is a small bump in its shoulder ) . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the peak progressively broadens and then , in a restricted range of intermediate temperatures , it changes its skewness from positive ( bottom panel in figure [ critg2hym]b ) to negative ( top panel in figure [ critg2hym]b ) .",
    "when the temperature is increased further , the peak shrinks again in the deconfined region . at even larger values of the hopping parameter ( @xmath126 )",
    "the situation changes again .",
    "the 6 additional @xmath2 gluons are now quite heavy and begin to decouple from the dynamics of the remaining 8 @xmath3 gluons . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath6 center emerges as an approximate symmetry which becomes exact in the pure @xmath3 limit .",
    "this manifests itself by an additional peak due to the presence of metastable @xmath6 images of the deconfined phase ( top panel in figure [ critg2hym]c ) .",
    "the metastable states become stable phases only at @xmath127 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath3 is embedded as @xmath128 in the real 7-dimensional representation of @xmath2 .",
    "the additional peak thus represents the sum of the two nontrivial @xmath6 images of the deconfined phase which explains its large height .",
    "still , at finite @xmath20 , the presence of the additional metastable peak is a finite size effect that disappears in the infinite volume limit .",
    "note that , for very large values of @xmath20 , the critical coupling of the @xmath2 gauge - higgs model at @xmath129 has to approach the critical coupling of the @xmath3 yang - mills theory at the same @xmath81 .",
    "taking into account a factor 7/6 due to the different normalization of the trace between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we have indeed verified this feature .",
    "we have investigated the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "this is interesting because @xmath2 is the smallest simply connected group with a trivial center . due to the trivial center",
    ", there is no symmetry reason for the existence of a finite temperature phase transition in @xmath2 yang - mills theory .",
    "still , using monte carlo simulations , we have found a clear signal for a first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "interestingly , @xmath3 is a subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , exploiting the higgs mechanism , @xmath2 can be broken down to @xmath3 , and one can thus interpolate between @xmath2 and @xmath3 yang - mills theories . remarkably , the @xmath2 phase transition disappears ( or at least weakens substantially ) before the @xmath3 transition emerges . from this observation",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 deconfinement phase transitions arise for two different reasons .",
    "the @xmath3 transition is an unavoidable consequence of the @xmath6 center symmetry which gets spontaneously broken in the high - temperature phase . as the 6 additional @xmath2 gluons ( transforming as @xmath7 and @xmath23 of @xmath3 )",
    "enter the dynamics , the @xmath6 center symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "just as in qcd with heavy quarks , this leads to a weakening of the deconfinement phase transition and possibly to its termination in a critical endpoint .",
    "we attribute the existence of the @xmath2 transition to a different mechanism : the transition arises due to a large mismatch in the number of the relevant degrees of freedom at low and high temperatures . in particular ,",
    "in the confined phase there is a small number of glueball states , while in the deconfined phase there is a large number of 14 deconfined gluons .",
    "when the higgs mechanism gives mass to 6 of these gluons , they are progressively removed from the dynamics .",
    "consequently , the mismatch in the number of degrees of freedom is reduced and the reason for the @xmath2 deconfinement phase transition disappears .",
    "our study contributes to the investigation of the deconfinement phase transition in yang - mills theories with a general gauge group .",
    "remarkably , in @xmath9 dimensions only @xmath10 yang - mills theory has a second order phase transition .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 yang - mills theories with any higher @xmath11 seem to have first order deconfinement phase transitions .",
    "although all @xmath12 yang - mills theories have the same nontrivial center @xmath13 , only @xmath14 has a second order phase transition , while @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and most likely all higher @xmath12 yang - mills theories have a first order transition . as for @xmath2",
    ", we have attributed this to the large number of deconfined gluons in the high - temperature phase @xcite .",
    "let us also discuss @xmath130 ( or more precisely @xmath131 ) yang - mills theories .",
    "since @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , we can limit the discussion to @xmath26 and higher . as far as we know , such theories have never been simulated . still , due to the large size of the gauge group ( just like @xmath16 , @xmath26 has 21 generators ) , we expect a strong first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "this finally leads us to the other exceptional groups @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , two of these  namely @xmath29 and @xmath32  have a trivial center , just like @xmath2 , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 have nontrivial centers @xmath6 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "however , independent of the center , since all these groups have a large number of generators , we again expect strong first order deconfinement phase transitions .",
    "we dedicate this work to peter minkowski on the occasion of his @xmath136 birthday . he was first to point out to one of us that @xmath2 has a trivial center .",
    "this paper is based on previous work with him on exceptional confinement in @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "we like to thank p.  de  forcrand , k.  holland , o.  jahn , and p.  minkowski for interesting discussions .",
    "this work is supported in part by the schweizerischer nationalfonds .",
    "there are several ways to simulate @xmath2 lattice gauge theory . in particular , cabbibo and",
    "marinari s method of updating embedded @xmath10 subgroups suggests itself .",
    "there are two ways in which @xmath10 subgroups can be embedded in @xmath2 . in the first case",
    ", the fundamental representation of @xmath2 decomposes as @xmath137 this applies to those three @xmath10 subgroups of @xmath2 that are simultaneously subgroups of the @xmath3 embedded in @xmath2 .",
    "then , just as in @xmath3 , cabbibo and marinari s method can be applied using a heat bath algorithm . in this way we have updated the @xmath3 subgroup of @xmath2 . however , there is a second case in which the fundamental representation of @xmath2 decomposes as @xmath138 due to the presence of the @xmath10 adjoint representation @xmath7 , in this case one can not apply the heat bath algorithm . instead of applying the metropolis algorithm",
    ", we use a look - up table of randomly distributed @xmath2 gauge transformations ( together with their inverses ) to rotate the @xmath3 subgroup through @xmath2 . combined with the heat bath update of the @xmath3 subgroup described above",
    ", this method is ergodic and obeys detailed balance .",
    "alternatively , one could use just a metropolis algorithm or perform updates in @xmath139 subgroups .",
    "due to round - off errors , it is important to occasionally project the link variables back into @xmath2 .",
    "this can be accomplished in a straightforward manner by going to the algebra of @xmath2 . however , there is a more efficient method that uses an explicit representation of the @xmath2 matrices  @xcite based on the fact that @xmath3 is a subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , a @xmath2 matrix @xmath34 can be expressed as the product of two matrices @xmath140 .",
    "the matrix @xmath141 belongs to the @xmath3 subgroup while the matrix @xmath142 is in the coset @xmath143 describing a 6-dimensional sphere .",
    "these matrices are given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a 3-component complex vector and @xmath146 is an @xmath3 matrix . the number @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 , while the @xmath149 matrices @xmath150 and @xmath151 are @xmath152 where @xmath153    the projection can be performed by obtaining the number @xmath61 and the vector @xmath145 from the matrix element @xmath154 and the 3-component vector @xmath155 .",
    "the matrix @xmath146 can then be derived from the @xmath156 matrices @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "finally , we note that using this parametrization one can see that @xmath34 indeed depends on 14 real parameters since the vector @xmath145 and the @xmath3 matrix @xmath146 depend , respectively , on 6 and 8 real parameters .",
