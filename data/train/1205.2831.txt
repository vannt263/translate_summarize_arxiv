    "linearly polarized ( lp ) ultraviolet ( uv ) or visible light is known to have a profound effect on the physical properties of some photosensitive materials such as compounds containing azobenzene and its derivatives  @xcite . in particular , such materials may become dichroic and birefringent under the action of lpuv light . over the past few decades this phenomenon    the so - called effect of _ photoinduced optical anisotropy _ ( poa )    which has a long history dating back almost a century to the original paper by weigert  @xcite has been attracted much attention for both technological and fundamental reasons .",
    "poa is of primary importance in the development of tools dealing with the light - controlled anisotropy and the materials that exhibit poa are very promising for use in many photonic applications  @xcite .",
    "poa also lies at the heart of the _ photoalignment _ ( pa ) technique which is employed in the manufacturing process of liquid crystal displays for fabricating high quality aligning substrates  @xcite .",
    "this method avoids the drawbacks of the traditional mechanical surface treatment and uses lpuv light to induce anisotropy of the angular distribution of molecules in a photosensitive film  @xcite .    when the irradiated layer is brought in contact with a liquid crystal ( lc ) , the surface ordering originated from the photoinduced anisotropy manifests itself in the anisotropic part of the surface tension known as the anchoring energy and determines the anchoring characteristics such as the anchoring strengths and the _ easy axis _ , @xmath0 , that defines the direction of preferential orientation of lc molecules at the surface .",
    "in this way , the light can be used as a means to control the anchoring properties of photosensitive materials .",
    "this is the light - induced anisotropy of the orientational distribution of molecules that reveals itself in poa and can be described as the _ photoinduced orientational ordering _ in photosensitive materials .",
    "such ordering , though not being understood very well , can generally occur by a variety of photochemically induced processes .",
    "these typically may involve such transformations as photoisomerization , crosslinking , photodimerization and photodecomposition ( a recent review can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of photoinduced ordering underlying poa and related photoaligning properties therefore can not be universal .",
    "rather they crucially depend on the material in question and on a number of additional factors such as irradiation conditions , surface interactions etc .",
    "these factors combined with the action of light may result in different regimes of the photoinduced ordering kinetics leading to the formation of various photoinduced orientational structures .",
    "the photoalignment has been studied in a number of polymer systems including dye doped polymer layers  @xcite , cinnamate polymer derivatives  @xcite and side chain polymers containing chemically linked azochromophores ( azopolymers )  @xcite .",
    "poa observed in similar polymers  @xcite was found to be long term stable so that the photoinduced anisotropy does not disappear after switching off the irradiation .",
    "most of the above mentioned polymer systems represent azocompounds that exhibit poa driven by the _",
    "trans_-_cis _  photoisomerization . in theoretical models",
    "@xcite , they are treated as ensembles of the stable _ trans _",
    "isomers characterized by elongated rod - like molecular conformation and the bent banana - like shaped _ cis _  isomers .",
    "the mechanism of photoisomerization implies that the key processes behind the photoinduced orientational ordering of azo - dye molecules are photochemically induced _ trans_-_cis _",
    "isomerization and subsequent thermal and/or photochemical _ cis_-_trans _   back isomerization of azobenzene chromophores .",
    "owing to pronounced absorption dichroism of photoactive groups , the photoisomerization rate strongly depends on orientation of the azo - dye molecules relative to the polarization vector of the pumping light , @xmath1 .    when the _ cis _  isomers are short - living ,",
    "the _ cis _  state becomes temporary populated during photoisomerization but reacts immediately back to the stable _ trans _",
    "isomeric form .",
    "the _ trans_-_cis_-_trans _",
    "isomerization cycles are accompanied by rotations of the azo - dye molecules that tend to minimize the absorption and become oriented along directions normal to the polarization vector of the exciting light @xmath1 ( the molecules with the optical transition dipole moment oriented perpendicular to @xmath1 are almost inactive ) .",
    "non - photoactive groups may then undergo reorientation due to cooperative motion  @xcite .    from the above",
    "it might be concluded that the photoinduced orientational structures will be uniaxially anisotropic with the optical axis directed along the polarization vector , @xmath1 .",
    "experimentally , this is , however , not the case . for example , constraints imposed by a medium may suppress out - of - plane reorientation of the azobenzene chromophores giving rise to the structures with strongly preferred in - plane alignment  @xcite .",
    "another symmetry breaking effect induced by polymeric environment is that the photoinduced orientational structures can be biaxial  @xcite ( a recent review of medium effects on photochemical processes can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "it was recently found that , similar to the polymer systems , the long - term stable poa in the films containing photochemically stable azo - dye structures ( azobenzene sulfuric dyes ) is characterized by the biaxial photoinduced structures with favored in - plane alignment  @xcite . unlike azopolymers , photochromism in these films is extremely weak so that it is very difficult to unambiguously detect the presence of a noticeable fraction of _ cis _  isomers .    over the last decade",
    "the photoaligning properties of such azo - dye ( sd1 ) films has been the subject of intense studies  @xcite .",
    "it was found that , owing to high degree of the photoinduced ordering , these films used as aligning substrates are characterized by the anchoring energy strengths comparable to the rubbed polyimide films . for these materials , the voltage holding ratio and thermal stability of the alignment turned out to be high .",
    "the azo - dye films are thus promising materials for applications in liquid crystal devices .",
    "the anchoring characteristics of the azo - dye films such as the polar and azimuthal anchoring energies are strongly influenced by the photoinduced ordering .",
    "in particular , the easy axis is dictated by the polarization of the pumping lpuv light , whereas the azimuthal and polar anchoring strengths may depend on a number of the governing parameters such as the wavelength and the irradiation dose  @xcite .    in a lc cell with the initially irradiated layer",
    ", the easy axis may rotate under the action of secondary irradiation with reorienting lp light which polarization differs from the one used to prepare the aligning layer .",
    "this effect    the so - called _ light - induced reorientation of the easy axis _    is governed by the _ photoinduced reordering _ of azo - dye molecules triggered by the reorienting light and may be of considerable interest for applications such as lc rewritable devices  @xcite .",
    "note that slow reorientation of the easy axis ( the light - induced easy axis gliding ) on the photosensitive layers prepared using the pa technique was originally observed on poly-(vinyl)-alcohol ( pva ) coatings with embedded azo - dye molecules  @xcite .",
    "for the azo - dye films , similar results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper the kinetics of photoinduced reordering underlying",
    "the light - induced easy axis reorientation on the azo - dye films will be our primary concern .",
    "in particular , we apply a generalized version of the theoretical analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to examine how the initial ordering of azo - dye molecules and the characteristics of reorienting light affect the regime of kinetics and the photosteady states .",
    "there are two phenomenological models formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite by using different theoretical approaches : ( a )  the two - state model is based on the above discussed mechanism of photoisomerization with short living excited _ cis _  state which is characterized by weak photochromism and negligibly small fraction of _ cis _  molecules that rapidly decays after switching off irradiation ; and ( b )  the diffusion model describes the light - induced reorientation of azo - dye molecules as rotational brownian motion governed by the light intensity - dependent mean - field potential .",
    "it turned out that predictions of the models are quite similar and they both were successfully used to interpret the experimental data .",
    "this equivalence points to the fact that , in the limiting case of short - living _ cis _  states , the photoisomerization cycles with orientation dependent isomerization rates may generally be viewed as a random walk on the sphere described by the fokker - planck equation for rotational diffusion . for our purposes , the latter will be conveniently employed to perform the theoretical analysis and to model the kinetics of reordering .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly recapitulate the theory  @xcite introducing the diffusion models where the process of photoinduced reordering is treated as a rotational diffusion in the effective mean - field potential . then , in sec .",

    "these include dielectric and kerr effect relaxation of polar liquids  @xcite , rotational diffusion of a probe molecule dissolved in a liquid crystal phase  @xcite and the molecular reorientation in liquid crystal phases  @xcite .",

    "there is also a local maximum peaked at the point @xmath164 in the interval ranged from @xmath149 to @xmath163 . referring to fig .",

    "it is the boundary point of the basins of attraction of the two steady states . in particular",
    ", this means that the order parameter harmonics @xmath116 converges to either @xmath149 or @xmath163 depending on whether its initial value @xmath167 is below or above the boundary value @xmath168 .    at @xmath169 and @xmath170 ,",
    "the initial data   are represented by two sets of real valued harmonics . from eq .",
    "it is evident that the only difference between the sets is the sign of the odd numbered harmonics . in particular , we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 at @xmath173 and @xmath170 , respectively .    at @xmath169 and @xmath174 ,",
    "the harmonics characterizing the equilibrium state , @xmath149 , is the attracting point for the order parameter harmonics and the azimuthal angle of the principal ( easy ) axis , remains intact , @xmath175 .",
    "the latter comes as no surprise because the polarization vectors of the initial irradiation and of the reorienting light are parallel , @xmath176    interestingly , orientation of the easy axis may stay unchanged even if the vectors , @xmath1 and @xmath145 , are perpendicular and @xmath177 .",
    "this occurs when the initial ordering is high , so that @xmath178 is greater than @xmath168 , @xmath179 . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : p1 - 90 ] , in this case , the attracting point is the metastable harmonics @xmath163 rather than the equilibrium one @xmath149 and @xmath175 .",
    "it can also be seen from the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : p1 - 90 ] that , in the opposite case of low ordered initial states with @xmath180 , the order parameter harmonics @xmath116 relaxes back to the equilibrium value @xmath149 .",
    "so , at @xmath180 , the azimuthal angle , @xmath181 , defines the steady state easy axis which is normal to the direction of its initial orientation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : p1-thresh ] , we show that , when the initial ordering is sufficiently high , the process of reorientation crucially depends on whether the photoexcitation parameter , @xmath58 , which is proportional to the intensity of the reorienting light , @xmath2 , exceeds its critical value , @xmath182 .",
    "this critical value determines the intensity threshold , @xmath183 , and the easy axis reorientation is suppressed at @xmath184 in the low intensity region below the threshold where @xmath185 .",
    "similar threshold behavior has been previously observed in a number of experimental studies on light - induced easy axis reorientation in nematic liquid crystal cells with photosensitive polymer substrates  @xcite . for azo - dye films , the experimental data of refs .",
    "@xcite also suggest the presence of a threshold when the polarization vector @xmath1 is directed along the initial easy axis ( see the subsequent section for more details ) .",
    "our result that under certain conditions highly ordered initial distributions may relax to the metastable stationary state offers a possible explanation for this .    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1 - 89 ] , it is seen that small deviations of the angle @xmath146 from @xmath186 have a destructive effect on metastability of the attracting point even if @xmath187 .",
    "it turned out that the basin of attraction of the metastable state is unstable with respect to fluctuations of the polarization azimuth @xmath3 .",
    "in the vicinity of the critical angle @xmath170 , the presence of the metastable state manifests itself as appreciably retarded relaxation to the equilibrium state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rho1 - 89 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the shape of the azimuthal angle   vs time curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha-89 ] points to a time delay in the process of principal ( easy ) axis reorientation .",
    "in the previous section we have examined the experimentally important predictions of the model .",
    "these predictions can , in principle , be tested and , in this section , we discuss some of our recent experimental results on the reorientational dynamics of the electrically assisted light - induced azimuthal gliding of the easy axis at varying polarization azimuth of lpuv reorienting light  @xcite .",
    "such gliding is found to take place on photoaligned azo - dye layers when irradiation of nematic lc ( nlc ) cells with lpuv light is combined with the application of ac in - plane electric field  @xcite .",
    "since the effects of electric field is well beyond the scope of the theoretical approach under consideration , the regime of purely light - induced reorientation will be our primary concern and we deal with the data measured in the electric field - free regions    in our experiments , lc cells ( @xmath188 m ) of sandwich like type were assembled between two amorphous glass plates .",
    "the upper glass plate was covered with a rubbed polyimide film giving the strong planar anchoring conditions .",
    "a film of the azobenzene sulfric dye sd1 ( dainippon ink and chemicals )  @xcite was deposited onto the bottom substrate on which transparent indium tin oxide ( ito ) electrodes were placed . the electrodes and the interelectrode stripes ( the gap was about @xmath189 m and the in - plane ac voltage was @xmath190  v with @xmath191  khz )",
    "were arranged to be parallel to the direction of rubbing ( the @xmath48 axis ) .",
    "the azo - dye sd1 layer was initially illuminated by lpuv light at the wavelength @xmath192  nm . the preliminary irradiation produced the zones of different energy dose exposure @xmath193  j/@xmath194 characterized by relatively weak azimuthal anchoring strength .",
    "the light propagating along the normal to the substrates ( the @xmath195 axis ) was selected by an interference filter .",
    "initial orientation of the polarization vector of the actinic light , @xmath196 , was chosen so as to align azo - dye molecules at a small angle of 4 degrees to the @xmath48 axis , @xmath197  deg .",
    "the lc cell was filled with the nematic lc mixture e7 ( merck ) in isotropic phase and then slowly cooled down to room temperature .",
    "thus we prepared the lc cell with a weakly twisted planar orientational structure where the director at the bottom surface @xmath198 is clockwise rotated through the initial twist angle @xmath197  deg which is the angle between @xmath198 and the director at the upper substrate ( the @xmath48 axis ) .",
    "in addition to the electric field , @xmath199  v/@xmath200 m , the cell was irradiated with the reorienting lpuv light beam ( @xmath201  mw/@xmath194 and @xmath192  nm ) normally impinging onto the bottom substrate . for this secondary lpuv irradiation , orientation of the polarization plane",

    "this time interval is short enough to ensure that orientation of the easy axis remains essentially intact in the course of measurements .",
    "the measurements were carried out at a temperature of 26@xmath203c .",
    "the case where the reorienting light is linearly polarized along the initial surface director @xmath198 and @xmath184 , was studied in refs .",
    "it turned out that , by contrast to the electrically assisted light - induced gliding , the purely photoinduced reorientation is almost entirely inhibited at @xmath184 . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fit - diff - bstb ] , the latter is no longer the case for the reorienting light with @xmath204 .",
    "thus the result is that , as opposed to the cases with non - vanishing electric field and @xmath205 , the purely photoinduced reorientation of the easy axis has been completely suppressed when the polarization plane is parallel to the initial easy axis . from the above discussion , our model predicts similar behavior that occurs in the bistability region where the reorientation is characterized by the threshold for the intensity of reorienting light .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit - diff - bstb ] shows the easy axis angle measured as a function of the irradiation time at various values of the polarization azimuth .",
    "the measurements were performed in the region outside the interelectrode gaps where the ac electric field is negligibly small . in the zero - field curves ,",
    "the easy axis angle increases with the irradiation time starting from the angle of initial twist , @xmath206 , and approaches the photosteady state characterized by the photosaturated value of the angle close to @xmath3 .",

    "we conclude this section with the remark concerning the phenomenological model formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the effect of the electrically assisted photoinduced gliding of the easy axis .",

    "the value of the characteristic time , @xmath226  min , estimated for @xmath227  deg differs from the one @xmath228  min obtained for other two angles , @xmath229  deg and @xmath230  deg . from the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit - diff - bstb ] , the case with @xmath231  deg is distinctive in initial ordering of the film .",
    "this result points to the fact that the coupling strength of the easy axis @xmath222 depends on the photoinduced order parameter of the initially irradiated azo - dye layer .",
    "such dependence was one of the key assumptions taken in ref .",
    "@xcite when applying the phenomenological model  @xcite to interpret the experimental data for photoaligned azo - dye layers prepared at different initial irradiation doses .",
    "in this paper we have studied the kinetics of orientational reordering that takes place in the azo - dye films under the action of lpuv reorienting light . in our theoretical approach ,",
    "the process of reordering is described in terms of a rotational brownian motion and we have employed the 2d diffusion model formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite to explore the peculiarities of the photoinduced reordering in the regime of purely in - plane reorientation .",
    "orientational ordering of azo - dye molecules is characterized by the in - plane ( 2d ) order parameter tensor  .",
    "this tensor is expressed in terms of the order parameter harmonics , @xmath72 , that enters the formula   giving both the value of the scalar order parameter , @xmath73 , and the azimuthal angle , @xmath138 , of the principal ( easy ) axis , @xmath232 .",
    "it is found that dynamics of the order parameter harmonics essentially depends on the initial ordering and the polarization azimuth of the lp reorienting light . in the long time",
    "limit , the order parameter harmonics approaches its steady state value reaching the regime of photosaturation .",
    "we have proved that , in the steady state , the easy axis azimuthal angle is dictated solely by the polarization azimuth , @xmath3 , ( see eq .  ) , whereas the photostationary value of the scalar order parameter is determined by the photoexcitation and intermolecular interaction parameters , @xmath233 and @xmath59 , defined in eq .  .",
    "in the @xmath58-@xmath59 plane , inequalities   define the bistability region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bifur](b ) ) with two locally stable stationary states : equilibrium and metastable ones .",
    "an experimentally important bistability effect is that the easy axis reorientation is inhibited when the intensity of the reorienting light linearly polarization along the initial easy axis is below its critical ( threshold ) value .",
    "such threshold behavior was observed in our experiments where the easy axis angle was measured as a function of the irradiation time at varying polarization azimuth of lpuv reorienting light .",
    "an alternative phenomenological model that also predicts the presence of the reorientation threshold was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that model ,",
    "the threshold effect comes about from the interplay between two competing easy axes .",
    "by contrast , in our model , the bistability appears as an intrinsic property of the reordering process in azo - dye films that manifests itself as the threshold of reorientation .",
    "there is another interesting bistability effect that occurs when the light is switched off ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath234 . in this case , owing to the rotational symmetry of the two - particle interaction  , the easy axis angle , @xmath138 , becomes undetermined and plays the role of the degeneracy parameter .",
    "the lpuv light field lifts the degeneracy and the dynamics of the angle turned out to be predominately governed by the photoexcitation parameter , @xmath58 .",
    "for the scalar order parameter which is related to the magnitude of the order parameter harmonics , @xmath156 , the rate of relaxation is typically at least twice faster than that for the easy axis angle . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1 - 65-mono ] , depending on the initial conditions , temporal evolution of this order parameter can be non - monotonic .",
    "these effects can also be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : distr-65-mono ] and  [ fig : distr - bstb ] that show how the orientational angular distribution of azo - dye molecules evolves in time .    by numerically solving the dynamical system for the angular distribution harmonics",
    "we have fitted the experimental data on the light - induced azimuthal gliding of the easy axis at the photoaligned azo - dye sd1 layer . in our analysis ,",
    "the photoinduced reordering of azo - dye molecules was assumed to be the key factor dominating the easy axis reorientation .    despite the fact that good agreement between the computed curves and the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit - diff - bstb ] ) counts in favor of our simplified approach , a deeper insight into complicated molecular mechanisms behind the gliding under consideration requires additional experimental studies and a more systematic theoretical treatment of the processes involved .",
