    "the linear theory applies on very large scales @xcite .",
    "however , the linear theory is not sufficiently accurate for purposes in the precision cosmology .",
    "accurate predictions of statistical measures of galaxy clustering beyond the linear theory are provided by nonlinear theories .",
    "the method of numerical simulation is one of the most straightforward ways of investigating nonlinear dynamics .",
    "however , they are not free from numerical artefacts and systematics , such as finite - volume effects , finite - resolution effects , and so forth .",
    "fortunately , the analytical perturbation theory is applicable on large scales where density fluctuations are small .",
    "thus the nonlinear perturbation theory of gravitational instability attracts renewed interests in recent years .",
    "the nonlinear perturbation theory have been developed since decades ago @xcite .",
    "the traditional perturbation theory is formulated in eulerian space , and such theory is referred to as the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) .",
    "the perturbation theory in lagrangian space is also formulated @xcite , which is called the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) .",
    "the first - order lpt corresponds to the classic zeldovich approximation @xcite .    in these years ,",
    "the renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) @xcite and other approaches @xcite have been developed to improve the accuracy of perturbation theory in nonlinear regime , partially taking into account higher - order effects of the spt .",
    "some of those approaches are based on the reformulation of fluid equations using the propagator , the vertex , and a source @xcite , which provides a way to use standard tools of field theory .",
    "nevertheless , various levels of approximations and ansatz should be employed in those approaches .",
    "the rpt and its variants mentioned above significantly improve the perturbation theory of dark matter in real space . however , one of the most important applications of the perturbation theory is to interpret the large - scale clustering of galaxies or other astronomical objects , observed by redshift surveys .",
    "the observable quantity in redshift surveys is the distribution of objects in redshift space .",
    "even though the rpt and its variants could be powerful in predicting the nonlinear power spectrum of dark matter in real space , one could not directly compare the theoretical prediction with observations .",
    "there are two obstacles to the comparison between the improved perturbation theories and observations .",
    "the first one is the redshift - space distortions : the redshift as a measure of the radial distance is contaminated by peculiar velocities .",
    "it is straightforward to take them into account in the spt framework @xcite .",
    "however , the spt in redshift space breaks down at larger scales than in real space and the applicability range of scales is fairly narrow @xcite , since the spt does not sufficiently reproduce the nonlinear smearing effects , known as the fingers - of - god ( fog ) effect @xcite .",
    "nonlinear modelings of the redshift - space distortions beyond the spt are proposed @xcite , in which the fog effects are phenomenologically put by hand .",
    "it is found in those studies that the fog effects can be represented by putting a gaussian damping factor in front of the power spectrum .",
    "it is shown that the gaussian damping factor in redshift space is naturally derived from the lpt @xcite , where the phenomenological gaussian factor should be modified and additional mode - coupling terms should be taken into account in nonlinear redshift space .    the second obstacle to the comparison between perturbation theories and observations is the biasing .",
    "any astronomical objects which can be observed are biased tracers of underlying mass distributions . in the galaxy redshift surveys , the tracers are galaxies .",
    "the exact relationship between the distribution of mass and that of galaxies depends on the complex , nonlinear process of galaxy formation which is not clearly understood",
    ".    analytic models of biasing have been proposed , including the model of local eulerian bias @xcite , the halo model @xcite , peaks model @xcite , etc .",
    "the first model is a purely phenomenological parameterization of the bias , assuming a local relation between the mass and galaxy distributions .",
    "the last two models are relatively more physical than the first one , and are categorized as the lagrangian bias , i.e. , the locations of the galaxy formation are specified in initial density fields . the location of a peak , for example",
    ", is displaced by the dynamical evolution of density fluctuations . in the framework of spt , the local eulerian bias is usually adopted @xcite .",
    "however , as shown below in this paper , the halo model and the peaks model are not compatible with the local eulerian bias in nonlinear regime , because the gravitational evolutions are nonlocal process in general .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : biases ] , the relation between the eulerian and lagrangian biases is shown .",
    "the relation between eulerian and lagrangian biases .",
    "the eulerian bias is expressible by the lagrangian bias ( dotted arrow ) and vice versa ( dashed arrow ) , only when the biases are allowed to be nonlocal .",
    "note that nonlinear evolutions and formation of objects are nonlocal processes in nonlinear regime . ]",
    "the final mass density field is the result of nonlinear evolutions from the initial mass density field .",
    "the final number density field of objects , which are observable such as galaxies , is the result of nonlinear evolutions and formations of those objects .",
    "the sites of the formation in lagrangian space define the initial number density field .",
    "thus the initial number density field also depends on the redshift of observation .",
    "the lagrangian bias corresponds to the relation between the initial mass density field and the initial number density field , while the eulerian bias corresponds to the relation between the final mass density field and the final number density field .",
    "the initial number density field is constructed only when the formation process is known .",
    "for example , the halo model and the peaks model give prescriptions of constructing the initial number density field from the initial mass density field ; i.e. , these models specify the lagrangian bias . in the halo model with the peak - background split @xcite , the initial number density",
    "is locally determined by initial mass density field .",
    "thus the halo model corresponds to a local lagrangian bias . in the peaks model ,",
    "the sites of the formation is not locally determined , since the peaks are defined not only by local values , but also by spatial derivatives of the field @xcite .",
    "thus the peaks model corresponds to a ( semi-)nonlocal lagrangian bias .",
    "such models of lagrangian bias are more physically motivated than the eulerian bias .",
    "the bias depends on the properties of observed objects , such as the mass and luminosity .",
    "the lagrangian bias schemes described above actually depend on the mass ( or the peak hight ) of collapsed objects .    the local lagrangian bias and the local eulerian bias are not compatible to each other in nonlinear regime .",
    "this fact is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : biases ] .",
    "the eulerian bias is expressible by the lagrangian bias ( dashed arrow ) and vice versa ( dotted arrow ) .",
    "the relations involves nonlinear evolutions of mass , and nonlinear evolutions and formation of observed objects .",
    "nonlinear evolutions and formations are nonlocal processes . therefore , the eulerian bias should be nonlocal even when the lagrangian bias is local .",
    "the local biasing schemes are compatible only in the case that the linear theory and a local approximation of formation process are valid .",
    "such conditions do not apply in generally nonlinear regime .    in reality , the bias is definitely nonlocal .",
    "for example , the galaxies are largely affected by their environment @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality should be taken into account in a precise modeling of the bias .",
    "the exact forms of the nonlocality in formation processes of observed objects have not been fully understood .",
    "it requires a lot of future work with analytic , numerical , and observational studies of complicated astrophysical processes to understand the exact nonlocality of bias .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to formulate a nonlinear perturbation theory which can handle both the eulerian and lagrangian nonlocal biases in general .",
    "there mainly two merits in this formulation .",
    "first , one can distinguish general properties of nonlinear clustering which do not depend on details of formation processes from those which largely depends on models of bias .",
    "second , it is straightforward to predict observable quantities in any models of bias .",
    "effects of redshift - space distortions and primordial non - gaussianity are also included in the formalism .",
    "resummation techniques in the presence of nonlocal bias are introduced as well .",
    "the resummations of bias are shown to be essential to handle the nonlocal bias in a general way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , both eulerian and lagrangian perturbation theories in real space are extended to include both the nonlocal bias and the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "diagrammatic methods with graphical representations are introduced .",
    "the relation between the perturbative kernels of ept and lpt with nonlocal bias is derived as well . in sec .",
    "iii , the formalism of the previous section is extended to include the effect of redshift - space distortions .",
    "techniques of the vertex resummations in our formalism are introduced in sec .",
    "iv , and finally , some models of the lagrangian bias are considered , illustrating how higher - order bias factors are evaluated in our formalism .",
    "in the following , the density contrast of observed objects x at a comoving , eulerian position @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath1 . the observed objects x can be any astronomical objects such as galaxies , quasars , absorption lines , 21 cm emissions , and so forth , which are selected and catalogued in a given redshift survey .",
    "the density field of the objects is not generally a local nor linear function of the underlying mass density contrast @xmath2 .",
    "instead , they are nonlocally and nonlinearly related to each other in general . in other words ,",
    "the density contrast @xmath3 of objects is a functional of the mass density contrast @xmath4 .",
    "the functional relation between density fields of mass and objects is deterministic on scales we are interested in .",
    "one might think that the formation process of objects is determined not only by the density field of mass , but also by other physical factors such as the local radiation density and its spectrum , merger histories of galaxies , etc . however , the dynamical evolutions in the structure formation are deterministic , and the initial density field uniquely determines all the subsequent states of the universe , including the above complex factors .",

    "thus we have a deterministic functional relation @xmath11 = { \\cal f}_{\\rm x}[{\\cal f}_{\\rm    m}^{-1}[\\delta_{\\rm m}]]$ ] .",

    "( [ eq:4 - 151 ] ) identically vanishes .",
    "the last term is proportional to @xmath391 , since @xmath392 .",
    "thus , the scale dependence of the first - order bias function should have a form , @xmath393 where @xmath394 this form is exact for peaks bias models @xcite , and higher - order powers of @xmath395 with @xmath78 do not appear .",
    "it is easily understood that the first bias function of peaks should have the form of eq .",

    "the explicit evaluations of the above coefficients are tedious . in ref .",

    "similar techniques should be also useful in our formalism , which we leave for future work .",
    "in this paper , the standard nonlinear perturbation theory of the gravitational instability is extended in several directions .",
    "one of the main extensions is the inclusion of the nonlocal bias , which is a general framework of biasing .",
    "nonlocal biases both in eulerian and lagrangian spaces are formulated and consistently included in ept and lpt , respectively .",
    "the nonlinear eulerian and lagrangian biases are compatible only in the framework of nonlocal bias .",
    "the relations among perturbation kernels of ept and lpt with nonlocal biases are derived .",
    "effects of redshift - space distortions and primordial non - gaussianity are also included in our formalism .",
    "therefore , our formalism provides a complete theory to predict the observable quantities in redshift surveys , once a model of bias and cosmology are given .",
    "the concept of vertex resummations in the presence of nonlocal bias is introduced .",
    "we show that the vertex resummation of the bias extends the applicability of the formalism to the case when the bias function(al ) can not be expanded into a taylor series .",
    "this extension is essential for handling , e.g. , the threshold bias and the peaks model , in which the bias involves singular functions such as the heaviside s step function , dirac s delta function , etc .",
    "calculation of perturbative bias functions in our formalism is exemplified by considering some models of local and nonlocal models of lagrangian bias , such as the threshold bias model , the multivariate bias model , the halo model , and the peaks model .",
    "the scale dependence of bias functions are straightforwardly obtained in our formalism once a model of nonlocal bias is given .",
    "the scale dependence of eulerian bias arises both from the nonlocal lagrangian bias and nonlinear evolutions .",
    "the formalism of the present paper provides a basic methodology for future applications of the perturbation theory .",
    "for example , the scale - dependent bias in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity has been derived by adopting either halo models @xcite or the local eulerian bias @xcite .",
    "our formalism allows to calculate the scale - dependent bias in any models of bias in a consistent manner @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum with bao in any given models of bias can be calculated with our formalism .",
    "the result of applying our formalism to a local lagrangian bias is equivalent to the work in ref .",
    "more precise modeling of the bias would be required in future analysis of the bao in the galaxy power spectrum to constrain the nature of dark energy .",
    "our formalism provides a way to perturbatively calculate the nonlinear power spectrum , bispectrum , trispectrum , and other polyspectra .",
    "these polyspectra are fundamental statistics and any other statistics in the large - scale structure , such as the correlation functions , counts - in - cells , genus statistics , etc",
