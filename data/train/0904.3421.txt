    "supermassive black holes ( mbhs ) at the centers of bulges and elliptical galaxies played an important role during galaxy formation and evolution , as revealed by remarkable correlations between their masses and some host galaxy properties ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al . 2000 ) and by many studies ( e.g. , merloni et al . 2004 ; sazonov et al . 2005 ; di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 , hopkins et al .",
    "an important aspect of the coevolution process is the interaction between the energy emitted by the accreting mbh and a galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) continuously replenished by normal stellar mass losses . in the absence of feedback from a central mbh ,",
    "this ism develops a flow directed towards the galactic center , accreting @xmath0 yr@xmath1 in a process similar to a `` cooling flow '' ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 , david et al .",
    "1991 , pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "therefore a few basic questions arise : 1 ) what is the fate of the large amounts of gas accreting towards the center during the galaxies lifetime , and not observed at any wavelength ( e.g. , peterson & fabian 2006 ) ?",
    "just @xmath21% of the mass made available by stars is in the mass of present epoch mbhs ( ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "2 ) how much radiative and mechanical energy output from the mbh can effectively interact with the surrounding ism ?",
    "3 ) what are the resultant masses of the mbhs at the present epoch ? and finally , 4 ) why bright agns are not common in the spheroids of the local universe , given the expected mass accretion rate ( e.g. , fabian & canizares 1988 , di matteo et al .",
    "2003 , pellegrini 2005a ) ?",
    "recently , the interaction of the mbh with the inflowing gas has been studied with high resolution 1d hydrodynamical simulations by ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) , ciotti , ostriker & proga ( 2009 , hereafter paper i ) and ciotti & ostriker ( 2009 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "these simulations included a detailed and physically based treatment of the radiative energy output from the mbh and its transfer in the ism , and of the mechanical energy from agn winds .",
    "they showed recurrent brief flaring of the nucleus , with the galaxy seen alternately as an agn / starburst for a small fraction of the time and as a `` normal '' quiescent elliptical for much longer intervals .",
    "accretion feedback proved effective in suppressing long lasting cooling flows and in maintaining mbh masses within the range observed today ( since gas is mostly lost in outflows or starbursts ) ; a major role in regulating the flow evolution was played also by type ia supernovae ( hereafter snia s ) .    here",
    "we present a preliminary investigation of the spectral and morphological appearance of this class of models in the x - ray band .",
    "in particular , we focus on the hot ism and the nucleus during the galaxy s lifetime , both in quiescence and during outbursts of activity , and we compare their properties with the observations collected for galaxies of the local universe by @xmath3 and more recently by @xmath4 .",
    "section 2 briefly describes the chosen representative model , section 3 its observational properties and a comparison with observational results , section 4 summarizes the conclusions .",
    "we anticipate here some general results for this class of models , and a more extensive description will be given in pellegrini , ciotti & ostriker ( 2009 , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "the main properties of feedback modulated galactic accretion flows are given in ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) and recently in papers i and ii , together with a full description of the code used for the simulations .",
    "briefly , the code integrates the time - dependent 1d eulerian equations of hydrodynamics , with a logarithmically spaced and staggered radial grid , extending from 2.5pc from the central mbh to 250 kpc .",
    "the code calculates self - consistenly the source and sink terms of mass , momentum and energy , associated with the evolving stellar population ( stellar mass losses and snia s events ) , nuclear starbursts , accretion and mbh feedback .",
    "gas heating and cooling are calculated for a photoionized plasma in equilibrium with an average quasar spectral energy distribution ( sazonov et al . 2005 ) , the resulting radiation pressure and absorption / emission are computed and distributed over the ism from numerical integration of the radiative transport equation .    of interest here",
    "is that the adopted radiative efficiency of material accreting on the mbh at a rate @xmath5 is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the eddington - scaled accretion rate , so that @xmath8 at large mass accretion rates ( when @xmath9 ) , and declines in a riaf - like fashion @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( as for radiatively inefficient accretion flows , narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the mechanical feedback implemented is that of quasar outflows [ e.g. , chartas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ] , as modelled numerically by proga ( 2003 ) .",
    "the mechanical efficiency scales with the eddington ratio ( @xmath12 , reaching a maximum value for @xmath13 of @xmath14 to @xmath15 in different models .",
    "note that only the mechanical feedback due to the broad line region wind is activated ( the nuclear jet properties will be inserted in a future work ) .    here",
    "we consider a representative model from the latest set of simulations ( paper ii ) , for an isolated typical elliptical galaxy with a central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath16 km s@xmath1 , a b - band luminosity @xmath17 , a stellar mass described by the jaffe law with a mass - to - light ratio @xmath18 , an effective radius @xmath19 kpc , a dark matter halo with equal amount of dark and visible mass within @xmath20 , a standard snia s rate ; the maximum value of the mechanical efficiency is set to @xmath21 .",
    "the simulations begin at a galaxy age of @xmath22 gyr ( i.e. , a redshift @xmath23 , the exact value depending on the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation , usually put at @xmath24 ) and soon agn outbursts develop , each followed by an abrupt drop of the accretion rate , and by times during which the galaxy is replenished of gas by the stellar mass losses .",
    "the typical behavior of the gas during an outburst starts with the off - center growth of a shell of denser gas ( at a radius of @xmath25 kpc ) that progressively cools , falls and reaches the center ( i.e. , a cooling collapse occurs ) .",
    "then a radiative shock quickly [ in @xmath26 yrs ] produces an outward moving shell of cold and dense gas , that slows down until it falls back towards the center , accumulating far more material than the first shell , and giving origin to a larger accretion and feedback episode . after some more events of this kind , a major shock leaves behind a very hot and dense center , and causes substantial galaxy degassing .",
    "the gas then cools and resumes its subsonic velocity , the density starts increasing again and the cycle repeats .",
    "overall , during outbursts both hotter and colder regions are continuously created , the hotter ones mainly at the center ( due to gas compressed by the falling shells , or to shocks ) and the colder ones due to the gas in the falling shells or in the radiative shocks .",
    "we remark that the representative model has fairly standard input parameter values , and its general properties described below are typical of this class of models . a large set of runs exploring the impact of different values for the feedback parameters ( e.g. , the wind opening angle , the peak mechanical efficiency and its dependence on @xmath27 ) showed present - day properties similar to those of the adopted representative model ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "we consider in turn the evolution of the luminosity of the nucleus ( section  [ nuc ] ) , of the total luminosity and emission weighted temperature of the hot gas ( section  [ global ] ) , of the temperature profile ( section  [ temp ] ) and of the surface brightness profile ( section  [ bril ] ) .",
    "the emission is calculated over the full @xmath4 sensitivity band ( 0.38 kev ) , and in two separate bands , 0.32 kev and 28 kev , by means of the apec code within the package xspec for the x - ray data analysis ( see paper iii for more details ) .    since in the simulations",
    "the treatment of feedback is physically based , not arbitrarily chosen and tuned to reproduce observations , any agreement or discrepancy of the resulting model properties with observations is relevant to improve our understanding of the mbh ",
    "ism coevolution .",
    "the time evolution of the bolometric nuclear luminosity shows strong intermittencies at an earlier epoch , reaching the eddington value , and becoming rarer and rarer with time , until a smooth , very sub - eddington phase establishes ( fig .  [ lnuc ] ) .",
    "this behavior follows from the secular decrease of the stellar mass loss rate ( fig .",
    "[ lnuc ] ) , which produces longer and longer times for the replenishment of the galaxy with gas . towards the present epoch ( a galaxy age of @xmath28 gyr ) the mass accretion rate is @xmath29/yr , that is @xmath30 ,",
    "therefore accretion has entered the riaf regime and @xmath31 ( sect .",
    "[ outbur ] ) .",
    "the nuclear bolometric luminosity is @xmath32 erg s@xmath1 and its @xmath33 , in agreement with the fact that in the local universe the fraction of mbhs approaching their eddington limit is negligible .",
    "for example , in the statistically complete palomar spectroscopic survey of 486 nearby galaxies only @xmath34% of ellipticals show emission line nuclei , mostly of low level ( @xmath35 erg / s ) ; for liners , a sub - sample largely dominated by ellipticals , @xmath36 ranges from @xmath37 to @xmath38 erg s@xmath1 , with a peak at @xmath39 erg s@xmath1 , and the median derives from the nuclear 210 kev emission , with @xmath40 as appropriate for low luminosity agns , and @xmath41 from mbh masses estimated from the mbh-@xmath42 relation . ]",
    "@xmath43 ( ho 2008 ) .",
    "seyferts excluded , nuclei of all types have @xmath44 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore the representative model may need a reduction of its @xmath36 , in addition to that produced by the adopted low radiative efficiency of riafs , to be more representative of the typical low luminosity nucleus of the local universe .    indeed , many nuclei of nearby ellipticals studied in detail in the x - ray band show emission at an extremely low level .",
    "their 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath45 , for a sample within @xmath34 mpc , with or without radio emission and residing in all kinds of environments , range from few@xmath46 erg s@xmath1 to @xmath47 erg s@xmath1 , with @xmath48 as low as @xmath49 the most common ( pellegrini 2005a , b ; see also soria et al . 2006 ; gallo et al .",
    "@xmath45 of the model at the present epoch can be derived from @xmath36 adopting a correction factor appropriate for the spectral energy distribution of a riaf , that is @xmath50 for low luminosity mbhs ( mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath51 erg s@xmath1 , and @xmath52 , both values again quite higher than typically observed .",
    "a reduction of the model nuclear luminosity could be accomplished by inserting the mechanical feedback and fig . 1 in paper i ) . ] of a jet or of a nuclear wind",
    ", that should naturally develop in low radiative efficiency accretion ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) , and should reduce further the mass accretion rate ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , the bondi accretion rate for the hot ism around many nearby mbhs , coupled to the riaf radiative efficiency , corresponds to luminosities still higher than observed , indicating the need for a reduction of the mass that actually reaches the mbh ( loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 , pellegrini 2005a , pellegrini et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "another indication of the relevance of mechanical feedback is the observed link between the radio luminosity and the x - ray gas asymmetry index for @xmath34 nearby ellipticals ( diehl & statler 2008a ) .    finally , note that @xmath53 is observed to be independent of the mbh mass and of the bondi accretion rate ( pellegrini 2005a ) .",
    "likely , neither bondi accretion nor simple riafs realistically describe the interaction between the outgoing energy flux and the incoming mass flux at the nucleus , while the fluctuations typical of feedback cycles can account for the observed lack of relationship .",
    "the time evolution of the gas emission shows peaks during outbursts , that become broader and less high with time increasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "soft and hard emission oscillate in phase and present the same overall behavior , with the hard one keeping @xmath54 times lower .",
    "hard emission during outbursts would be difficult to distinguish from the contribution of unresolved binaries even with @xmath4 , if extended ( e.g. , trinchieri et al . 2008 ) , but it could be detected if centrally concentrated ( see also sect .",
    "[ bril ] ) .",
    "the largest compilation of the global x - ray emission of early type galaxies of the local universe is based on @xmath3 observations of a relatively unbiased sample of 401 objects , homogeneously analyzed ( osullivan et al .",
    "the best fit correlation with the b - band luminosity of the emission mostly due to hot gas ( @xmath55 ) , after subtraction of the stellar contribution , predicts @xmath56 erg s@xmath1 for @xmath17 as the model galaxy .",
    "however at this @xmath57 , due to the large scatter around the best fit , the observed @xmath55 ranges from @xmath58 erg s@xmath1 up to few @xmath59 erg s@xmath1 ( though @xmath60 few@xmath61 erg s@xmath1 belong to galaxies with an important contribution from the intragroup or intracluster medium ) . at an age of @xmath62",
    "gyr the model has @xmath63 erg s@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , on the lower end of the observed range .",
    "this indicates that degassing is too efficient in the simulations , at least at the present epoch .",
    "this problem would be alleviated by an external pressure from an outer medium ( e.g. , vedder et al .",
    "1988 ) , a more appropriate `` boundary '' in fact for ellipticals that usually are not isolated ( it will be considered in future simulations ) .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the evolution of the soft ( @xmath64 ) and hard ( @xmath65 ) emission weighted temperatures within the optical @xmath20 , and their complex behavior during outbursts .",
    "the sharp and high peaks in @xmath65 correspond to the onset of very hot regions , while the decrements in @xmath64 are due to a dense cold shell preceeding the major burst and to cold gas swept by the radiative shocks produced by the outburst ( see sect .  [ outbur ] ) .",
    "the 0.38 kev emission weighted temperature ( not shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is almost coincident with @xmath64 , except for those short times with a very hot gas component .",
    "@xmath3 observations showed a correlation , though with a large degree of scatter , between the temperature weighted with the soft emission of the whole galaxy ( @xmath66 ) and the central @xmath42 ( osullivan et al . 2003 ) , predicting @xmath67 kev ( with observed values from @xmath68 to @xmath69 kev ) for @xmath16 km s@xmath1 as for the model galaxy . at the present epoch",
    "the model has @xmath70 kev , lower than the best fit prediction but within the observed range , and @xmath71 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "likely the observed @xmath66 refers to a region less extended radially ( and typically also hotter ) than used for the model galaxy .",
    "average temperatures within @xmath20 have been obtained with @xmath4 ( athey 2007 ) , whose high angular resolution allows for a better subtraction of the point ( stellar ) source contribution and then gas temperatures closer to the true ones . for 22 athey s galaxies with log @xmath57=10.5 to 10.8 , similar to that of the model ,",
    "the average 0.38 kev emission weighted temperature is @xmath72 kev , close to @xmath64 though slightly lower .    summarizing ,",
    "the gas content of the model is lower than the average observed for a galaxy of its size ; this shows the need for a lower snia heating , or a higher / more concentrated gravitating mass , or the confining effect of an external medium .",
    "the average temperatures instead agree reasonably with observations , and modifications to the model should not increase the average temperature within @xmath20 , while they could increase a little that over the whole galaxy .",
    "the emission - weighted and projected temperature profiles are shown during quiescent inter - burst periods in fig .",
    "[ t2 ] , and during the last outburst at @xmath73 gyr in fig .",
    "[ t3 ] . during quiescent times",
    "the profiles are smooth , with the temperature monothonically decreasing for increasing radius ( from @xmath69 kev at a radius of @xmath74 pc to @xmath75 kev at @xmath76 kpc ) .",
    "negative temperature gradients are typical of inflowing gas in steep potentials ( e.g. , pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) , just due to compressional heating .",
    "diehl & statler ( 2008b ) suggest that negative temperature gradients could be the sign of localized heating by a central , weak agn .",
    "in fact in the models , even during quiescent times , accretion is present ( though with a low radiative efficiency , sects .",
    "[ outbur ] and [ nuc ] ) , and this has an additional heating effect over gravitational compression on the gas at the center .",
    "negative gradients are commonly observed among ellipticals , as revealed by @xmath4 for an increasing number of galaxies ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 , athey 2007 , diehl & statler 2008b ) , and the temperature roughly halves from the center to the galaxy outskirts , as in the model .",
    "a few galaxies have central temperatures of @xmath69 kev ( as in fig .  [ t2 ] ) , while most show temperatures between 0.5 and 1 kev at their innermost radial bin .",
    "however , the model temperature calculated as an average for a central bin extending out to 0.5a few kpc , as for observed galaxies , will be lower than 1 kev .",
    "while a more detailed comparison is postponed to paper iii , we conclude here that no additional heating seems to be required in the central region ( as found in sect .",
    "[ global ] ) .",
    "in other observed profiles the temperature increases outward , or keeps roughly flat , or is `` hybrid '' , firstly decreasing from the central value to a minimum and then increasing out to the edge of the galaxy ( diehl & statler 2008b ) .",
    "these profiles could be produced in the model by environmental effects currently not included ( e.g. , vedder et al .",
    "1988 , mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "a temperature decreasing towards the center is also observed , but is never shown by the model during quiescence . a central drop in temperature and a shape resembling the hybrid profile",
    "are shown during particular phases of outbursts , when the major shock is moving outwards or the cold shell is forming ( see fig .",
    "[ t3 ] that illustrates the messy temperature distribution during the @xmath77 gyr of an outburst , consequent to the gas flow behavior described in sect .",
    "[ outbur ] ) .",
    "we noted ( sect .",
    "[ nuc ] ) that the stationary hot accretion phase needs a reduction of the accretion rate , as can be provided by a jet .",
    "in a recent @xmath4 analysis the temperature profiles outside @xmath78 showed gradients that switch monothonically from positive to negative going from high to low radio luminosities within three @xmath20 ( diehl & statler 2008b ) .",
    "to be consistent with this result , the jet addition to the simulations should heat the gas outside @xmath79 .    finally note that the temperature profile of the elliptical ngc3411 shows an intriguing off - center dip ( osullivan et al .",
    "2007 ) that is highly unusual for standard cooling flow models but is present in a few profiles in fig .",
    "this dip corresponds to a ripple in the observed x - ray brightness profile , that is also a frequent feature in the model ( sect .",
    "[ bril ] ) .      the evolution of the surface brightness profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ brilou ] , right before and during the last major outburst , and in fig .",
    "[ brilfin ] , during the subsequent slow evolution until the present epoch quiescent state . in fig .",
    "[ brilou ] curves labelled 1 and 2 show two subsequent times of the off - center shell formation , lasting @xmath80 gyr .",
    "curve labelled 3 shows a shock moving outwards after the major outburst ( in the upper panel ) and the presence of very hot gas at the center ( lower panel ) ; this phase lasts for @xmath81 yr .",
    "curve labelled 4 shows the result of the degassing caused by the passage of the shock waves : the galaxy has a low gas density and subsonic perturbations remain at a radius of a few tens of kpc ; the time is @xmath50 gyr since the outburst started .",
    "note how the main features in the profile are above the levels of background and of unresolved stellar emission ( described in the caption of the figures ) .",
    "the high - temperature , high - density phase at the center ( curve 3 ) is very brief , and unlikely to be observed .",
    "disturbances as shells and ripples lasting @xmath50 gyr are more likely to be observed .",
    "in fact , many nearby galaxies show these characteristics in their images , as recently proven with @xmath4 studies ( diehl & statler 2008a , machacek et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "interestingly , three bright ellipticals imaged with @xmath4 ( loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) all show a flattish x - ray brightness profile within the central 310 arcsec ( @xmath82 kpc ) , that is not possible to reproduce with inflow models , while it resembles the profile of the `` pre - burst''phase ( curves 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ brilou ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the x - ray properties of a galaxy model representative of a recent investigation of feedback modulated accretion including the combined heating of radiation and agn winds ( papers i and ii ) , and we have compared them with observations of the local universe . besides important achievements as limiting the growth of the mbh mass to observed values ( papers i and ii ) , thanks to the present analysis these models also reveal important aspects of the mbh ",
    "ism coevolution , as detailed below .    at the present epoch a highly sub - eddington ( @xmath83 ) phase establishes with accretion in the low radiative efficiency regime .",
    "though within the range observed , the nuclear emission is quite larger than the most frequently observed values [ @xmath84 .",
    "this suggests that an additional mechanism reducing further the mass available for accretion is important , as could be provided by a nuclear jet or wind from a riaf .    during the many outbursts",
    ", the gas emission @xmath55 presents peaks that become broader as time increases ; sharp peaks and decrements are shown respectively by the hard and soft emission weighted temperature . at the final quiescent times , @xmath55 is on the lower side of those observed , which suggests degassing may be less efficient , or the confining agents ( gravitating mass , external medium ) more efficient .",
    "the emission weighted temperatures instead compare well with observations .",
    "the profiles of brightness and temperature ( decreasing outward ) in quiescence resemble those of many local galaxies .",
    "outbursts produce features in the brightness profile that are detectable with @xmath4 , last for @xmath50 gyr , and could match part of the widespread gas disturbances observed in local galaxies .",
    "the hot bubbles inflated at the center produce central peaks in the hard band brightness profile , but their short duration makes them difficult to observe .    in conclusion ,",
    "a form of feedback lowering further the nuclear luminosity during the stationary hot accretion phase seems important .",
    "this should not increase the central temperature that is already consistent with observed values .",
    "a jet interacting mainly outside @xmath85 would then be preferable ; it should also heat the gas there , to bring the overall temperature profile in accord with those observed ( increasing outward ) at high radio luminosities .",
    "the additional feedback should not lower @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we comment on how @xmath55 and the gas temperature might scale with galaxy properties , and with how much scatter . a change of the mass content and distribution , snia rate and external pressure will have an impact on the gas content , and also on the possibility of having outbursts until the present epoch , or no outbursts at all .",
    "for example , the snia heating may keep small galaxies in an outflow so that outbursts never happen ; due to a larger dark matter content , galaxies as the representative model may never experience a huge degassing , and may host nuclear outbursts until the present epoch .",
    "in general , we expect a trend of @xmath55 with @xmath57 mainly determined by the galaxy structure and snia s heating , as described by older studies ( e.g. , pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) , to which scatter is added by feedback , but only for luminous galaxies ( as the representative model ) .",
    "the frequency of outbursts at the present epoch is difficult to estimate , given the many parameters involved , but it should be very small ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "the hot gas disturbances shown by @xmath4 have been mostly attributed to an ongoing or recent jet activity ( e.g. , diehl & statler 2008a , b ) , though evidence for this is not always present ( e.g. , ngc4552 , machacek et al .",
    "2006 ) . a statistically complete sample of galaxies with information on the nature of activity and of the gas disturbances will hopefully be built soon from the large @xmath4 database .",

    "<S> the centers of elliptical galaxies host supermassive black holes that significantly affect the surrounding interstellar medium through feedback resulting from the accretion process . the evolution of this gas and of the nuclear emission during the galaxies lifetime has been studied recently with high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these included gas cooling and heating specific for an average agn spectral energy distribution , a radiative efficiency declining at low mass accretion rates , and mechanical coupling between the hot gas and agn winds . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a short summary of the observational properties resulting from the simulations , focussing on 1 ) the nuclear luminosity ; 2 ) the global luminosity and temperature of the hot gas ; 3 ) its temperature profile and x - ray brightness profile . </S>",
