    ", we base the low energy description on an effective orbital only model in the regime of strong on site coulomb repulsion . due to the many competing couplings involved in the problem",

    "this analysis provides an unbiased insight on the character of the ground - state configurations as the microscopic interactions are treated without any approximation and on equal footing .",
    "then , considering an embedded cluster approach where the intra - plaquette hamiltonian is solved via ed while the inter - plaquettes interaction is treated within a self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) approximation , we extract the phase diagram for the allowed broken symmetry configurations .",
    "+ there are two main aspects behind the general complexity of the problem we faced ; i ) the heisenberg - like hamiltonian for pseudospin-1 that we considered is marked by directional exchanges that in two - dimensions , due to the peculiar connectivity via the oxygen ligands of the @xmath2 centers , lead to antiferromagnetic correlations that are highly frustrated ; ii ) the tetragonal and the orthorhombic crystal field terms act like effective orbital fields that do not commute between each other . in this respect , even considering the case of a s=1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian , one can notice that the application of two non - commuting fields would produce a problem that can not be solved exactly even in one - dimension .  @xcite we underline that our orbital case refers to a spin-1 like system thus it intrinsically contains extra degrees of freedom whose interplay with the presence of two - non - commuting fields adds extra difficulties and different scenarios as compared to the spin-1/2 situation . + in particular , the octahedral distortions lift the pristine orbital degeneracy and set orbital patterns that privilege exchange along the easy axis @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to lowering the local number of active degrees of freedom , that is reduced to the only two orbital configurations that can be effectively connected along the selected direction .",
    "given this scenario , we show that the application of the field along the hard axis restores the local orbital fluctuations among the whole @xmath2 subspace , by reintroducing the extra configuration that was quenched by the balance between orbital exchange and crystal field amplitudes . + special attention",
    "is devoted to analyzing the consequences of activating two or three of the @xmath2 local orbital configurations on the evolution of orbital order .",
    "one of the main findings is that a polarizing orbital field destabilizes antiferro - orbital ordered phases , both when applying the field along the easy or the hard axis .",
    "however , we show that depending on the axial direction , we get two fundamentally different mechanisms : for a field applied along the easy axis @xmath21 , the effect of the field is mainly to reorient the orbital moments inducing ferro - orbital correlations in the direction of the transverse applied field . due to the orbital configurations",
    "involved , this situation still has the features of an orbitally ordered state , where nearest - neighbor antiferro - orbital correlations are strongly suppressed .",
    "on the contrary , in the hard axis @xmath22 case , the activated configuration along @xmath14 reduces the amplitude of the ordering orbital moments in zero field up to reach an orbital disordered phase .",
    "+ we finally consider possible connections between the symmetry breaking associated with the orbital ordered state and the peculiar magneto - conducting behavior of layered ruthenates .",
    "+ the paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we introduce and write down the microscopic model ; in sec .",
    "iii we present , for a @xmath23 plaquette , the numerical results obtained for the phase diagram as function of the microscopic parameters stressing the role played by the purely structural distortions and their interplay with external magnetic field while in sec .",
    "iv we present embedded mean field calculations based on exact diagonalization of 2x2 plaquette ; the last section contains a discussion of the results presented and the conclusions .",
    "based on the assumption that the planar spin configuration is not substantially modified by the applied field , we consider the coupling between the field and the local orbital angular momentum contribution as the dominant one . in particular , starting from different orbital ordered ( oo ) ground states at zero field",
    ", we will study how these configurations are modified as a consequence of the induced orbital  flip \" via the coupling between the applied field and the orbital angular momentum along different symmetry in - plane directions .",
    "then , by means of these results , we will consider the evolution of the ground state under the external field , and in turn use such investigation to discuss the possible implications with respect to the anomalous cmr phenomenon observed in the ca@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7 .    as mentioned in the introduction , to investigate the correlations developing within the orbital sector , we start from a situation where the system is fully polarized and all the spins are aligned along a given crystallographic direction , in accordance to the observed a - type configuration . in this frame , the attention is focused on the orbital degree of freedom , out of the competition between the coulomb repulsion ( orbital exchange ) , octahedral distortions , and the effect of the orbital field . in particular , having in mind the ca - based ruthenates , the case of flat octahedral configuration with orthorhombic distortions is considered .",
    "in such a scheme we can explore the interplay between orbital exchange and the quenching of orbital correlations provided by structural distortions .",
    "the specific model hamiltonian we refer to is built up by the following contributions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the orbital exchange interaction , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the crystalline fields terms , describing local @xmath18-axis tetragonal distortions and in - plane orthorhombic deformations , respectively , and @xmath28 represents the coupling of the orbital angular momentum to the external field .",

    "due to the connectivity via intermediate oxygen ligands , only two out of the three @xmath2 orbitals can be effectively connected for each axial direction .",
    "the spin / orbital model for ca - ruthenates can be directly derived from the one adopted for cubic vanadates  @xcite , by performing a particle - hole transformation within the @xmath2 sector , in a way to map the problem of four electrons to that of two holes and consequently the doublon states in ` no hole ' configurations . in this way",

    "[ fig : pdhhardce ] , and found that the onset of wo region grows linearly with @xmath166 .",
    "these aspects underline that the softening of afo correlations is here caused by the reduction of onsite orbital momentum due to the new activated flavor , instead of by the field - induced fo correlations .",
    "we have here presented a study of field tunability of orbital correlations for layered ruthenates in an insulating ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution of the possible orbital patterns under the effect of the external magnetic field coupled to the local angular momentum only .",
    "numerical calculations on a 2@xmath12 cluster and of a cluster embedded in a periodic environment reveal that the competing effects driven by orbital exchange and crystal field put the system on the verge of a fo / afo behavior , a circumstance that makes the character of oo in absence of an applied field quite elusive . this outcome may be supported by recent resonant x - ray scattering measurements on ca@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7  @xcite , where no appreciable signal of staggered fo or afo is found within experimental resolution .",
    "we argue that this feature is at the origin of the soft behavior and the easy field- tunability of the oo phases .",
    "particularly , afo exchange leaves the place to strongnext - nearest neighbors fo correlations when an external orbital field is applied along the easy axis , while we get a tendency to a isotropic weak antiferro - orbital correlated state for the hard axis .",
    "an interpretation of these results can be summarized as follows : the orthorhombic deformations tend to remove the orbital degeneracy and lead to an ordered state where only two local @xmath2 configurations are active .",
    "the effect of the polarizing field is to keep the orbital correlations in the two - orbital sector when the field is along easy - axis ; otherwise , along the hard - axis the field forces the system to allow for all possible local orbital fluctuations .",
    "the latter situation is responsible for demolishing the oo ground state set by the competition between coulomb and crystal field interactions . speaking on a general ground , in many",
    "multi - orbital mott insulators the metal - insulator transition occurs as a symmetry breaking phase transition leading to magnetic , orbital and charge orderings .",
    "we speculate that a possible connection may exist between the demolition of long range oo by an applied field and a likely metallic behavior and that this connection may be of interest when referred to unconventional magneto - conducting properties of ca@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "+ we finally point out some important remarks about a quantitative connection of our calculation to the physical parameters regime expected in the layered ruthenates , and specifically of ca@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7 . according to our results , the evolution of region boundaries between afo , c - afo or wo behaviors is mainly concentrated within the windows @xmath167 and @xmath168 . checking the range of the microscopic parameters that bias",
    "the proposed orbital patterns is not easy since the amplitude of @xmath115 , @xmath68 and @xmath166 is difficult to be directly measured and require a model derivation .",
    "an explicit @xmath169 evaluation for ca@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7 is not yet available . for the closest members of ruddlesden - popper series according to their physical and structural properties , ca@xmath6ruo@xmath20 and sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath7 respectively ,",
    "one ends up with the following @xmath169 estimates @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172  @xcite .",
    "these values set the ratios @xmath173 and @xmath174 , whose orders of magnitude are compatible with our choices of analysis for the regions of phase diagrams where major changes occur .    99 s. maekawa , t. tohyama , s.e .",
