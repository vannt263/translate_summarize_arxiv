    "dwarf irregular ( dim ) galaxies serve as laboratories of star formation without the influence of spiral density waves or shear .",
    "they have evolved relatively slowly over time and chemically resemble the outer parts of present - day spirals .",
    "ultra - low surface brightness dims may represent the slowest evolving galaxies in the universe .",
    "if dims evolve via periodic starbursts , then they could dominate intermediate redshift surveys .",
    "they are so numerous and contain such a large fraction of their mass in gas , that the most distant dwarfs may dominate the faint qso absorption lines .",
    "they are like the proposed building blocks of spiral galaxies in the cold dark matter theory .",
    "for all of these reasons , dim galaxies are an important component of the universe .",
    "normal dim galaxies span a range of a factor of @xmath0 in star formation rate per unit area , yet detailed studies of their stellar populations suggest that most evolve with a star formation rate that varies by only a factor of a few over time ( ferraro et al.1989 ; tosi et al .  1991 ; greggio et al .  1993",

    "some show evidence of higher amplitude variations , however ( israel 1988 , tolstoy 1996 , dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997 , greggio et al .",
    "1998 , tolstoy et al.1998 ) . what distinguishes",
    "dwarf galaxies with high star formation rates from those with low rates ?",
    "we believe this variation , which is also present to a lesser extent in spirals ( kennicutt 1989 ; rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2000 ) , indicates there is a fundamental aspect of star formation that is missing from the current theory .",
    "what governs star formation locally within a galaxy is also not clear .",
    "dense , star - forming clouds and h@xmath1ii  regions form near the central regions , yet the detectable stars extend far beyond this , with the gas going out further still . does star formation also occur in the outer disk but without showing prominent h@xmath1ii  regions ?    in a differentially - rotating disk",
    "there is a critical column density @xmath2  above which the disk is unstable to ring - like perturbations in the radial direction ( toomre 1964 ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) and martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) determined the analogous column density for star formation using a sample of sc spiral galaxies .",
    "they found that the ratio of observed gas density @xmath3  to critical gas density @xmath2  has a characteristic value at the radius where significant star formation ends .",
    "presumably gas is too stable to form stars further out .    motivated by the success of the toomre gravitational instability model for spiral galaxies , we and others applied it to dim galaxies ( hunter & plummer 1996 ; meurer et al .  1996 ; van zee et al.1997a ; hunter , elmegreen , & baker 1998 ) .",
    "the results suggested that dims should not be forming stars at all : most have @xmath3@xmath4@xmath2  throughout .",
    "the model also fails to predict where star formation ends or which galaxies have higher rates .",
    "a related result was found for spiral galaxies : stars continue to form beyond the radius where the gas surface density drops below the threshold ( ferguson et al .",
    "these results implied that processes other than large - scale spontaneous instabilities are important in tiny galaxies and the outer parts of spiral galaxies , leading us to examine more local effects .",
    "these include triggering from supernovae and other stellar pressures and gravitational collapse following turbulence compression ( see review by mac low & klessen 2004 ) . also likely to be important",
    "is the thermal state of the gas , that is , whether cool clouds can form at the local pressure and radiation field ( e.g. , elmegreen & parravano 1994 ; wolfire et al .",
    "2003 ; schaye 2004 ) .    in a study of the dim ngc 2366 ( hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden 2001a )",
    ", we found that star formation occurs primarily where the gas column density exceeds 6 m_@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ( also see van der hulst et al .",
    "1993 ; van zee et al .  1997a ; meurer et al .",
    "this threshold corresponds approximately to the presence of a cool phase of h@xmath1i , which may be a second requirement for star formation .",
    "we also found that the peak densities in regions of star formation are equal to the local tidal densities for gravitational self - binding of a co - rotating cloud against galactic tidal forces .",
    "this binding condition may be more fundamental than the toomre condition because it is local , 3-dimensional , and does not involve ring or spiral arm generation as an intermediate step toward star formation .    to address the question of what regulates star formation in tiny galaxies , we have conducted a multi - wavelength survey of a large sample of reasonably normal , relatively nearby galaxies without spiral arms .",
    "the data consist of ubv and h@xmath7  images for the entire sample , and jhk images , h@xmath1imaps , co observations , and h@xmath1ii  region spectrophotometry for a sub - sample .",
    "the h@xmath7 , ubv , and jhk image sets act as probes of star formation on three different times scales : h@xmath7  images trace the most recent star formation ( @xmath810 myrs ) through the ionization of natal clouds by the short - lived massive stars ; ubv , while a more complicated clue , is dominated by the stars formed over the past gyr for on - going star formation ( gallagher et al .  1984 ) ; and jhk integrates over the lifetime of the galaxy ( hunter & gallagher 1985a ) .    so far , we have used these data to conduct several case studies ( ngc 2366 : hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden 2001a ; ddo 88 : simpson , hunter , & knezek 2005a ; ddo 43 : simpson , hunter , & nordgren 2005b ) as well as studies of the h@xmath1ii  region luminosity function and distributions ( youngblood & hunter 1999 , roye & hunter 2000 ) , gas abundances ( hunter & hoffman 1999 ) , pressures of h@xmath1ii  regions relative to the background galactic disk ( elmegreen & hunter 2000 ) , and v - band and h@xmath7  power spectra ( willett , elmegreen , & hunter 2005 ) .",
    "the h@xmath7  data of the entire sample were presented previously ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "here we present the ubvjhk imaging data of the full sample .",
    "the 136 sample galaxies are listed in table [ tab - sample ] where we have grouped the galaxies into three categories : im94 systems , blue compact dwarf ( bcd)24 systems , and sm18 systems .",
    "the morphological classifications were taken from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991@xmath9rc3 ) .",
    "irregular galaxies were first described by hubble ( 1926 ) as `` lacking both dominating nuclei and rotational symmetry '' with the `` magellanic clouds [ as ] the most conspicuous examples . ''",
    "the sm class was created when de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) described an extension of `` the spiral sequence into the irregular types '' which he noted as `` sbd or sbm . ''",
    "this extension was motivated by the `` recognition of spiral structure in the magellanic clouds and objects of similar type '' ( de vaucouleurs 1954 ) .",
    "the sm class was later described by de vaucouleurs ( 1963 ) as `` the transition stage toward the magellanic irregulars i m ( whether barred or not ) . ''",
    "the bcd class is not part of the rc3 morphological system , but rather was imposed on galaxies after the identification of compact , high surface brightness `` hii galaxies '' that are dominated by nebular emission lines ( sargent & searle 1970 ) .",
    "some bcds have properties similar to those of i m systems ( kunth 1985 ) . to select bcds that are comparable to the i m galaxies we used the width at 20% intensity of the integrated hi profile w@xmath10 to select systems that are comparable in mass to i m systems ( w@xmath10@xmath8175 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the galaxies were chosen to be relatively nearby , and biased to systems containing gas .",
    "the sample is not complete , but it spans a large range in galactic parameters and is representative .",
    "the galaxy characteristics include a range in integrated luminosity ( m@xmath12 of @xmath139 to @xmath1319 ) , average surface brightness ( 20 to 27 mag / arcsec@xmath14 ) , current star formation activity ( 0 to 1.3 m_@xmath5  yr@xmath11 kpc@xmath6 ) , and relative gas content ( 0.02 to 5 m_@xmath5/l@xmath15 ) .",
    "a more complete description of the sample and of its selection is given by hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) where we present the h@xmath7imaging data .",
    "four galaxies observed in h@xmath7  are not included here because we do not have broad - band imaging of them ( ngc 1705 , ngc 2101 , ngc 3109 , f567 - 2 ) , and two additional galaxies ( ddo 125 and mrk 67 ) have been dropped because they are interacting with companions . on the other hand , two galaxies without h@xmath7  imaging",
    "are added to the broad - band imaging sample ( f473-v1 and f620-v3 ) .",
    "the distances to the galaxies in our sample and references from which the distances are taken are given in table [ tab - sample ] .",
    "we used distances determined from variable stars or the tip of the red giant branch , if they were available .",
    "other distances were determined from the radial velocity relative to the galactic standard of rest v@xmath16 ( rc3 ) and a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 . while this might not be the most modern version of the hubble constant and we do not correct for virgo - infall , we have retained the distances that were used in the presentation of the h@xmath7  survey data ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) and in several papers presenting hi data ( simpson et al .  2005a , b ) so that combining data from the various wavelengths is straightforward .",
    "two galaxies  f473-v1 and f620-v3have no distance determination .    for comparison to spiral galaxies",
    "we have used the sample compiled by kennicutt ( 1983 ) .",
    "this sample of 74 galaxies spans the range of morphologies from sab to sd .",
    "kennicutt has measured h@xmath7  fluxes for these galaxies .",
    "other properties were obtained from rc3 and fisher & tully ( 1981 ) . for the spirals , @xmath17 , the average b - band surface brightness within an isophote of 25 magnitudes in 1 arcsec@xmath14 ( discussed below in fig .",
    "[ fig - histsb25 ] ) , has been converted from the value in the rc3 to one that matches the definition of surface area used here , i.e. the area of the projected ellipse used for the denominator of the surface brightness calculation in the rc3 has been replaced here with the area of the circle having a radius equal to the semimajor axis .",
    "foreground reddening e(b@xmath13v)@xmath18 was determined from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) and values are given in table [ tab - sample ] .",
    "the reddening law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) was adopted with a@xmath19e(b@xmath13v)@xmath20 , where the total e(b@xmath13v)@xmath20 is that due to foreground plus internal reddening .",
    "an internal reddening correction of e(b@xmath13v)@xmath21=0.05 was adopted for all sample galaxies .",
    "for the kennicutt ( 1983 ) sample of spirals , an extinction correction was made to face - on orientation using the formulation of tully et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the minor - to - major axis ratios given by rc3 .",
    "we then adopted a face - on internal e(b@xmath13v)@xmath22 of 0.2 mag .",
    "note that this is a change from our treatment of spirals in hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) where we adopted a single internal reddening of 0.3 mag after kennicutt ( 1983 ) with no correction based on inclination . for 8 spirals",
    "the difference compared to our previous treatment is an increase in e(b@xmath13v)@xmath20 of 0.10.2 mag , and for 4 spirals the increase is as high as 0.5 mag .",
    "but for the other 63 galaxies the change is less than 0.1 mag , sometimes to a greater reddening correction and sometimes to a smaller correction .",
    "ubv images of our sample galaxies were obtained by one of us ( dah ) in 27 observing runs , all but two of which took place 1997 to 2002 .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "most galaxies were observed in u , b , and v , but three have only b and v and 6 have only v images .",
    "one galaxy is shown in figure [ fig - images ] for illustration .",
    "all of the data are available from http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/images/ , and a few ubv color images constructed from the ubv can be seen at http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/ubv.html .    most of the observations were made with a site 2048@xmath232048 ccd binned @xmath24 on either the lowell observatory 1.1 m hall telescope or the lowell observatory 1.8 m perkins telescope .",
    "three galaxies  f565-v2 , f563-v1 , and f561 - 1were observed with a ti @xmath25 ccd on loan from the u. s. naval observatory , flagstaff station coupled with a 4:1 focal reducer . in most cases several images were obtained of each galaxy in each filter .",
    "the telescope position was usually offset 20  between each observation in order to average over flat - fielding defects .",
    "the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using twilight sky flats .",
    "the counts in the twilight sky flats were high enough that they contribute much less than 1% uncertainty to the galaxy images .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "for some galaxies observed on cloudy nights , frames of the galaxy were taken on separate clear nights for purposes of calibration .",
    "the multiple images of a galaxy in each filter were aligned and averaged with an algorithm to eliminate cosmic rays but preserve the photometric integrity of the image .",
    "the scale , seeing ( fwhm of isolated star profiles ) , and rms of the photometric calibration of the final images are given in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration is not included in the photometric uncertainty of extracted quantities .",
    "a few galaxies were kindly imaged for us by p. massey using the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope and either a 2048@xmath232048 tektronix ccd or the noao ccd mosaic imager , an array of 8 2048@xmath234096 site ccds . in the case of the mosaic imager",
    ", the galaxy was centered on and completely contained within one of the ccds . for the mosaic imager ,",
    "dome flats and twilight sky flats were used to remove the pupil ghost as well as determine the pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the images were corrected for geometrical distortions and stacked to produce a single final image in each filter .",
    "( see massey and collaborators `` local group survey : mosaic reduction notes '' at http://www.lowell.edu/users/massey/lgsurvey/splog2.html for details on how they have reduced mosaic imager data ) .",
    "the mosaic imager data were calibrated using field images and standard stars observed at the lowell observatory 1.1 m telescope .",
    "p. massey also obtained b and v images of ic 1613 for us with the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) curits schmidt 61 cm telescope and a site @xmath26 ccd .",
    "in addition , sextans a was observed by us with the ctio 0.9 m telescope and these data are described by hunter & plummer ( 1996 ) .",
    "ic 4662 and ddo 214 images were obtained with the ctio 1.5 m and reported by hunter et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "we also observed ddo 214 at lowell observatory , and we have treated the two sets of observations of ddo 214 separately for purposes of comparing photometry and other derived parameters .",
    "however , the images obtained at lowell observatory go deeper and are preferred for that reason , while the ctio observations include u. images of ngc 6822 were taken by c. claver with the prime focus direct imager on the ctio 4 m telescope and a tektronix @xmath26 ccd .",
    "these data were calibrated with images obtained with the lowell observatory 1.1 m telescope .",
    "finally , v - band images of haro 3 were obtained as part of service observing on the kpno 0.9 m telescope with a tektronix @xmath26 ccd .    before performing surface photometry , we edited foreground stars and background galaxies from the final ubv images , interpolating across the edited region .",
    "usually , the v - band image was done by hand , and then the cursor log file produced from that was used to remove objects from the other two filters . in that way",
    ", objects were removed in the same manner from each filter .",
    "one uncertainty in the galaxy surface photometry of the outer regions is in distinguishing galactic from other objects .",
    "we then made a two - dimensional non - linear fit to the background and subtracted it from the image to produce a sky - subtracted final image for analysis ( after bell et al .",
    "2000a and de jong & van der kruit 1994 ) .",
    "sky subtraction is an important source of uncertainty in our surface photometry .",
    "therefore , to gain confidence in our results , we have explored the uncertainty in the sky .",
    "first , we computed half of the difference between the maximum and minimum in the fit to the sky over the images ( not just in the region of the galaxy but excluding a border around the edges of the images ) .",
    "the average in this quantity is 1.2% of the sky .",
    "this is the contribution to the uncertainty that would result if we did not remove the large - scale variation at all , and obviously we have done better than that by fitting and subtracting the background .",
    "second , we have taken the uncertainty of the sky from poisson statistics of the sky counts ( formula given in  3.3 ) : the square - root of the sky counts times the gain of the ccd . for each of our images the poisson statistics",
    "yields a greater uncertainty  an average of 2.2% per pixel  than those from the difference between the maximum and minimum in the sky fit .",
    "thus , we assume that our sky uncertainty is dominated by poisson statistics , especially after removal of the large - scale variations , and poisson statistics is the uncertainty that we use throughout this paper .",
    "using this uncertainty gives us confidence in the results that stand out above the sky .",
    "this confidence will be important in our discussion of outer disk profiles , where the galaxy intensity is far below the sky intensity but well above the uncertainty of the sky intensity .",
    "the average poisson variation in the galaxy counts , combined with the average uncertainty in the sky fit , suggests that the average uncertainty in the photometric measurement of our galaxies is of order 0.020.03 mag .",
    "jhk images of 41 galaxies in our sample ( 26 i m , 12 bcd , and 3 sm ) were obtained by one of us ( dah ) in 9 observing runs 1996 february to 1998 may .",
    "seventeen galaxies were observed in only j or , in the case of ddo 35 , only h. twelve galaxies were observed in j and h , and 12 in j , h , and k. the observations are listed in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "one galaxy is shown in figure [ fig - images ] for illustration .",
    "all of the data are available from http://www.lowell.edu / users / dah / images/. these images were obtained using the ohio state infrared imager - spectrograph ( osiris ) on the perkins 1.8 m telescope .",
    "the instrument consisted of four mosaiced detectors to create a total array of 256@xmath23256 pixels .",
    "observations were made with a pixel scale of 1.50  for a total field of view of 6.4 .",
    "zero - second dark frames were subtracted from all of the data , the image pixel values were corrected for non - linearity effects , and pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations were removed using observations of a white screen in the dome .",
    "since osiris consists of four detectors , separate linearity corrections were determined for and applied to each quadrant of an image .",
    "non - linearity was of order 3% at levels of 15,000 counts .",
    "we took images of the white screen in the dome both with and without the screen illuminated , and subtracted the latter from the former in order to remove stray background light before forming the flat - field correction .",
    "observations of the galaxies consisted of several integrations of approximately 5 , 10 , and 20 seconds for k , h , and j - bands , respectively . for large galaxies that occupied most of the field of view , the telescope was moved about 5away for sky observations every few minutes or less .",
    "periodically the direction and length of throw to sky were varied , and the center of the galaxy was moved around in steps of 10 .",
    "the purpose of these steps was to allow the pattern of stars in the sky observation and the locations of hot pixels relative to the galaxy to change so that they could be removed . for small galaxies",
    ", the telescope was nodded between images to place the galaxy alternately on one - half of the array and then the other , allowing sky to be determined while also observing galaxy .",
    "the object frames were sky - subtracted , aligned , and averaged .",
    "`` ukirt '' standard stars from the list compiled by s.  courteau were used to calibrate the photometry , and so the photometry is on the ukirt system .",
    "the california institute of technology ( cit ) photometric system is 8% bluer in j@xmath13h and 4% bluer in h@xmath13k compared to the ukirt system .",
    "each star was observed 4 times with the star placed in each quadrant of the detector array in turn , and sky for a specific observation was taken from the observations with the star in the other quadrants .",
    "we checked our photometry by comparing with the ir photometer observations of ngc 4449 made by hunter & gallagher ( 1985a ) with a 16  aperture .",
    "our imaging data yielded j and h magnitudes that were 0.24 magnitudes brighter than those obtained by hunter and gallagher , but the j@xmath13h color difference was zero .",
    "we observed a few spiral galaxies in jhk for comparison .",
    "these include ngc 3274 ( sabd ? ) , ngc 4027 ( sb(s)dm ) , ngc 4684 ( s(r)b0@xmath27 ) , ngc 4800 ( sa(rs)b ) , and ugc 2984 ( sbdm@xmath27 ) .",
    "we did not obtain ubv observations for these systems .",
    "in addition , we observed the h@xmath1ii  region ngc 5471 in m101 and the globular cluster ngc 6229 for examples of a very young and a very old stellar population , respectively .",
    "surface photometry was performed on all of the broad - band and h@xmath7  images .",
    "because i m galaxies are lumpy , automatic ellipse fitting routines seldom perform well on these galaxies .",
    "therefore , we determined the center of the galaxy , position angle , and ellipticity from a contour in the outer half of the v image which was block - averaged by factors of a few to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "the center is simply the geometrical center of this isophote and the major axis is the longest bisector that passes through the center that , as much as possible , symmetrically divides the galaxy .",
    "one exception was ddo 40 for which an inner contour was used instead because the outer extended starlight did not seem to fairly represent the bulk of the galaxy .",
    "we then fixed these parameters and integrated in ellipses that increase in semi - major axis length in approximately 10  steps .",
    "the center , position angle ( p.a . ) , minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath28 , and ellipse step size are given in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "bad pixels due to unsubtracted or poorly subtracted foreground stars , satellite trails , or other flaws were masked and not used in the photometry .",
    "the flux in each ellipse was scaled from the actual area used to the expected area of the ellipse to account for such masked pixels . in the cases of ddo 143 ,",
    "haro 36 , and mrk 16 , much of the galaxy image was obliterated by a very bright nearby star .",
    "since we wished to compare the surface brightness photometry between these various images , we geometrically transformed the ubjhk and h@xmath7  images to match the v image and used the same elliptical integration parameters as were used for v. the exception was that in a few cases h@xmath7  required more ellipses ( see especially , ngc 1569 ) .",
    "the surface photometry was fit with @xmath29 which represents an exponential disk and r@xmath30 is the scale - length of the disk .",
    "the range of radii to fit was determined for each galaxy from examination of a plot of @xmath31 or @xmath32 as a function of radius .",
    "deviations from a linear relation in the center or in the outer parts or excursions due to a very large star - forming region as in ngc 2366 were excluded from the fit .",
    "the fit was made with uniform weighting of each radial data point . in some galaxies",
    "@xmath31 is best fit with two lines instead of one . in those cases ,",
    "each fit was done separately , and , again , the range of radii to fit for each line was determined by examining the @xmath31(r ) plot .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the surface photometry at each annulus was determined assuming poisson statistics , and is the sum of the squares of the uncertainties in the galaxy counts in each of the two ellipses that form the annulus and in the sky for each ellipse , divided by the galaxy counts in the annulus , @xmath33 : @xmath34 where subscript @xmath35 and @xmath36 refer to the first and second ellipses that bracket the annulus in question , @xmath37 is the sky - subtracted counts , @xmath38 is the average sky per pixel in the image , @xmath39 is the area of the ellipse in pixels , and @xmath40 is the gain of the ccd .",
    "an example of our surface photometry is given in figures [ fig - sb ] and [ fig - colors ] .",
    "ngc 2366 was chosen for this example because it has a complete ubvjhk data set .",
    "plots of all of the surface photometry can be obtained from http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/sbplots .",
    "integrated photometry is given in table [ tab - integrated ] .",
    "the integrated photometry is given at several different radii for each galaxy , including the half - light radius r@xmath41 and radii appropriate to the jhk images .",
    "usually , k does not go as deep as h ; h as deep as j ; or j as deep as v. therefore , photometry values are reported at the maximum extents for reasonable uncertainties in each of the jhk passbands .",
    "the largest radius listed is the maximum extent of the v - band measurements .    in table",
    "[ tab - structure ] we report various structural parameters measured from the surface photometry .",
    "this includes the exponential disk fits to both v ( first line ) and j ( second line ) , if available .",
    "some galaxy profiles were best fit with two lines , rather than a single line . in these cases ,",
    "r@xmath30 and @xmath42 labeled as `` primary '' are those derived from the fit to what we considered to be the part of the profile that represents the bulk of the underlying stellar disk .",
    "the second fit is labeled `` secondary . ''",
    "r@xmath43 is the radius at which the two fits cross , and the column labeled `` sec ? ''",
    "tells whether the secondary fit is to the outer part of the profile ( `` o '' ) or to the inner profile ( `` i '' ) . in the case of the bcds , we have assumed that the inner part of the disk is dominated by the intense star formation there and so the outer galaxy is a truer representation of the underlying stellar disk ( see , for example , noeske et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the case of",
    "the i m and sm galaxies that do not have centrally concentrated and intense star formation , we take a change in the outer disk , which usually occurs at low surface brightness levels , to represent a deviation from the basic underlying stellar disk , as is seen in some spirals ( pohlen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "double - exponential disks may contain important information concerning star formation processes in galaxies . a star formation model that reproduces this profile",
    "is suggested in a companion paper ( elmegreen & hunter 2005 ) . because breaks in surface photometry profiles at low light levels could be caused by over or under subtraction of sky",
    ", it is important to demonstrate that these breaks are not artifacts of data handling .",
    "first , we note that many of the breaks occur at relatively high surface brightness levels where small errors in the determination of sky do not have much effect .",
    "second , we have done ultra - deep imaging of three of our sample of i m galaxies in order to examine the outer parts of the disks in more detail ( hunter , elmegreen , & anderson 2006 ) .",

    "third , we have verified that the double exponentials are present in the data by making intensity cuts 11 pixels wide along the major axes of seven of the systems .",
    "differences between the two sides of the galaxy are sometimes apparent in these cuts , which is to be expected for irregular galaxies .",
    "however , the break in the exponential profile is still clear on each side .",
    "this result implies that the azimuthal - averages used for the exponential fits in our full sample are not introducing false breaks that make them look like double exponentials .",
    "such false breaks were suggested to be a possible source of smoothly tapering outer disk structure by van der kruit ( 1988 ) , who noted that edge - on galaxies usually have very sharp outer truncations .",

    "however , some irregular galaxies exhibit peculiar features that go beyond the norm for the class , and these are identified in table [ tab - stuff ] .",
    "several of the galaxies are curved or have crescent shapes : ddo 215 and f533 - 1 .",
    "there are a few that have elongated structures extending from or curving around part of the galaxy ( ddo 25 , ddo 169 , f620-v3 , ngc 2552 , ugc 5716 , ugc 8276 ) that look like spiral - arm fragments or tidal tails .",
    "others have broad , asymmetrical extensions ( ddo 27 , ddo 35 , ddo 40 , ddo 63 , ddo 99 , ddo 214 , f651 - 2 ) or peculiar twists ( ddo 48 ) .",
    "one galaxy , ddo 165 , has a sharp , curved southern edge .",
    "some galaxies are simply messy with strong central regions and lower surface brightness scatter ( ddo 9 , ddo 34 , ddo 68 , ugc 199 , ugc 8055 , ugc 11820 ) . in all ,",
    "18 of the 94 i m galaxies ( 19% ) have noticeable large - scale morphological peculiarities , as do 5 of the 18 ( 28% ) sm systems .",
    "oddly , none of the 24 bcd systems show these kinds of peculiarities even though the unusual intensity and pattern of star formation of the class suggest that these galaxies have incurred interactions .",
    "the sample with morphological peculiarities has the same distribution of current star formation rates as the rest of the sample , but tends to be bluer .",
    "we have compared the position angles of the morphological major axis of the h@xmath1i  and of the optical components of those survey galaxies with h@xmath1i - line interferometric data in the literature .",
    "we eliminated galaxies with @xmath59 since the optical position angle is poorly determined when the image gets round .",
    "we have also eliminated galaxies with no clear rotation since the h@xmath1i  kinematical axis is then poorly determined . that left 31 i m and 6 sm galaxies ( no bcds ) .",
    "of these the majority have position angle differences that are less than 30 ; seven galaxies have differences of 4080 . of these 7 galaxies ,",
    "3 are barred .",
    "since bars can rotate with respect to the rest of the disk , a misalignment between the major axis of the bar and the outer disk is not unusual .",
    "the misalignment in the remaining 4 galaxies ( ddo 26 , ddo 53 , ddo 86 , ddo 168 ) may indicate a past disturbance .",
    "these galaxies , 13% of the ims with h@xmath1i  interferometric data , are not marked as having morphological peculiarities , but the h@xmath1i  kinematics are also peculiar in two of them ( ddo 26hunter & wilcots 2002 , ddo 168broeils 1992 ) .",
    "these galaxies , combined with the fraction that show unusual morphological structures , mean that as many as one - third show some abnormality .",
    "the most common phenomena that would account for these distortions to galaxy disks are interactions with other galaxies or extragalactic h@xmath1i  clouds .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that our sample is biased against obviously interacting systems .",
    "dwarfs are also much more susceptible than giant spirals to disruption by the pressures of star formation .",
    "this follows from the low surface densities and interstellar pressures in dwarf galaxies , the lower levels of dust absorption at low metallicity , and the brighter uv fluxes from metal - poor massive stars .",
    "interstellar turbulence at typical velocities should also be more disruptive in dwarfs than in spiral galaxies because the rotation speeds of the dwarfs are lower . when the turbulent speed is a large fraction of the rotation speed ,",
    "the epicyclic radius becomes a large fraction of the disk scale",
    ". then turbulent excursions that produce shells , holes , and cloud complexes are large compared to the disk scale - length , resulting in a more irregular overall appearance .",
    "some fraction of disk galaxies are barred , and irregular galaxies are no exception .",
    "however , identifying bar structures in irregular systems is harder than in spirals because the symmetry provided by spiral arms is missing .",
    "furthermore , bars in i m galaxies can be comparable in size to the optical galaxy ( ngc 1156 : hunter et al .",
    "2002 ; ngc 2366 : hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden 2001a ; ngc 4449 : hunter , van woerden , & gallagher 1999 ) , so a large - scale boxy appearance due to a bar could be hard to distinguish from inclination effects .",
    "the contour plots that were used to determine the surface photometry parameters were also examined for the signs of a bar structure .",
    "a boxy appearance turning to rounder isophotes in the outer parts and/or a twisting of isophotes from the inner galaxy to the outer galaxy were considered strong signs of a bar .",
    "bar structures were often apparent in color - color ratio images as well , since many of the bars are blue and lined with h@xmath1ii  regions .",
    "if a galaxy appears to be barred , the bar length , minor - to - major axis length ratio , and change in position angle between the bar and the outer galaxy , if any , are given in table [ tab - stuff ] . characteristics of the bar were measured from a contour plot of the v - band image that was block - averaged by factors of a few to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "the edge of the bar was taken to be the contour at which the shape ceased to be boxy and became more spherical and/or where the position angle changed .",
    "these changes were generally obvious but rarely sharp . the ambiguity in the end of the bar is quantified in the uncertainty in the bar s length .    in all",
    ", 22 of our 94 i m galaxies ( 23% ) show evidence for a bar structure while 3 of 24 bcds ( 12% ) and 9 of 18 ( 50% ) sms do . given the sample sizes , the percentage of bcds and sms with bars is not more than one sigma different from that of the ims . the semi - major axis of the bar r@xmath60 relative to the disk scale - length r@xmath49 is shown in figure [ fig - rbrd ] .",
    "r@xmath60 is most often 1.52r@xmath49 for i m galaxies ; the range is 0.85r@xmath49 to 3.5r@xmath49 and 7 of the 22 barred i m galaxies have r@xmath60 greater than 2r@xmath49 .",
    "thus , the bars in i m galaxies are relatively large , and in some cases occupy most of the optical galaxy .",
    "the bars in the sm sample are smaller with a typical length of 11.5r@xmath49 and only one galaxy has a bar greater than 2r@xmath49 .",
    "bar minor - to - major axis ratios @xmath61 range from 0.33 to 0.80 for i m galaxies with a typical value being 0.60.7 . bars in our sm galaxies have similar shapes .",
    "we have made profile cuts through the major and minor axes of the bars , centered on the optical center of the bar determined from the bar s outer isophotes in v. these profiles are illustrated in figure [ fig - barcuts ] . in some cases , the major and minor axes profiles are similar to each other , meaning that the bars are relatively thick .",
    "most of the major axis profiles are exponential , as in late type galaxies in general ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) , but a few are flat , such as ddo 35 , ddo 154 and ddo 133 .",
    "there are no other obvious difference between these two cases .",
    "because of the spectacular offset bar in the nearby i m galaxy lmc , it is often assumed that bars in i m galaxies are generally offset from the galaxy centers . in our sample of barred galaxies , we found that the optical centers of the bars in 68% of the i m galaxies , 100% of the bcds , and 67% of the sms lie within 500 pc of the center of the galaxy defined by the outer v - band isophotes in the plane of the sky .",
    "only 14% of the ims ( 3 galaxies ) and 22% of the sms ( 2 galaxies ) have bars whose centers lay more than 1 kpc from the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "the majority of i m galaxies with measurable offsets ( 57% , 8 galaxies ) have offsets that are less than half of a disk scale - length .",
    "only one has an offset that is greater than r@xmath49 .",
    "the 4 sm galaxies with measurable offsets lie between 0.4r@xmath49 and 0.6r@xmath49 .",
    "we conclude that the offset feature of bars is not a general phenomenon of late - type galaxies .",
    "bars in i m galaxies appear to trigger a substantial amount of star formation .",
    "figure [ fig - barsim ] shows histograms of the integrated star formation rates , the average surface brightnesses inside r@xmath49 , and the ratios of the radial extents of the h@xmath1iiregions to r@xmath49 for the barred and unbarred samples .",
    "the medians for these three quantities , respectively , are @xmath62 m_@xmath5  yr@xmath11 kpc@xmath6  ( the logarithm of the integrated star formation rate normalized to the area within r@xmath49 ) , @xmath63 v - magnitude arcsec@xmath6 , and @xmath64 for barred ims , and @xmath65 m_@xmath5  yr@xmath11 kpc@xmath6 , @xmath66 v - magnitude arcsec@xmath6 , and @xmath67 for non - barred ims .",
    "bars apparently increase the areal star formation rates and surface brightnesses by a factor of 2 to 3 , and they increase the radial extents of the h@xmath1ii  regions by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this increase may simply reflect the increased density of gas in a bar compared to a non - barred central region , although gas shocking in a bar flow or gas pileup at the end of a bar could be additional triggers ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1980 ) .",
    "slight shifts like these in star formation properties are also seen for bcd galaxies , but the statistics are too poor to make a conclusion . there is no obvious trend for the sms .",
    "past studies of the distributions of projected optical minor - to - major axis ratios @xmath28 have derived the intrinsic shape of i m galaxies under the assumptions that there is one intrinsic shape and that galaxies are oriented at random on the sky .",
    "however , different studies have come to quite different conclusions .",
    "hodge & hitchcock ( 1966 ) and van den bergh ( 1988 ) found that i m galaxies are modestly thick disks with an intrinsic ratio @xmath54 of 0.30.4 rather than the 0.2 value generally adopted for spirals .",
    "staveley - smith , davies , & kinman ( 1992 ) suggested from gas kinematics that the disk is thicker than this , with @xmath69 . on the other hand , binggeli & popescu ( 1995 ) and sung et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that i m galaxies are triaxial in shape , similar to dwarf ellipticals .",
    "the distribution of projected @xmath28 for our sample of galaxies is shown in figure [ fig - ba ] .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are relatively low only for i m galaxies , which show a peak at @xmath70 to 0.6 .",
    "although intrinsically flat , some edge - on i m galaxies might be mis - identified as type sm or even in some cases sd . in any case , the decrease at low @xmath28 in figure [ fig - ba ] is consistent with an intrinsic thickness equal to @xmath71 times the major axis length ( hodge & hitchcock 1966 ; van den bergh 1988 ) .",
    "the decrease at large @xmath28 could be caused by an intrinsically triaxial shape .",
    "the random projection of circular disks would give a flat distribution of @xmath28 up to @xmath72 , which is not observed .",
    "figure [ fig - wl2 ] shows a model for the distribution of axial ratios that fits the observations for i m galaxies .",
    "the model calculates the distribution of projected @xmath28 for random orientations of triaxial ellipses that have intrinsic ratios of width ( w ) to length ( l ) uniformly distributed in the range 0.7 to 1 , and intrinsic ratios of thickness ( z ) to length uniformly distributed in the range 0.29 - 0.67 ( see discussion of triaxial models in elmegreen et al .",
    "if this is the explanation for the distribution of apparent axial ratios in i m galaxies , then they are triaxial with an average ratio of around @xmath73 .",
    "this is similar to what sung et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found@xmath74 ( see also binggeli & popescu 1995 ) .",
    "however , figures [ fig - sblongrd_bamv ] and [ fig - babmva_longrd ] suggest the situation is slightly more complicated than this . here",
    "we plot @xmath51 , integrated m@xmath58 , 2.5r@xmath49 , and ( b@xmath13v)@xmath75 , all as functions of @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the average v - band surface brightness within @xmath52 , normalized to the area in the ellipse that integrates the light at 2.5r@xmath49 , rather than the circular area in the plane of the galaxy used for the values given in table [ tab - stuff ] ; @xmath51 is smaller ( brighter ) than @xmath50 listed in table [ tab - stuff ] by @xmath76 .",
    "the three galaxy types are plotted with different symbols and colors , and the lines are averages for each type in intervals of 0.1 in @xmath28 .",
    "the top part of figure [ fig - sblongrd_bamv ] indicates that the @xmath51 values for i m galaxies at the peak of the @xmath28 distribution are clustered near the limit of detection , which is at the lower part of the panel .",
    "the two figures further show that the sizes and luminosities are smallest at the peak of the @xmath28 distribution . outside of these regions in the figures ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath28 values is more uniform .",
    "this suggests that the smallest and faintest i m galaxies could be triaxial , but the larger and brighter ims are more disk - like .",
    "an alternative possibility for this distribution is that we have observed only the edge - on examples of the ims that have very low intrinsic surface brightness .",
    "an edge - on projection of a disk has a higher apparent surface brightness than the face - on projection , in proportion to the ratio of optical path lengths .",
    "thus the extremely faint i m s could be visible only when viewed edge - on ( see elmegreen et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the bottom part of figure [ fig - sblongrd_bamv ] indicates that all galaxy types in our sample brighten slightly as @xmath28 increases , and correlation coefficents are consistent with this .",
    "the increase follows from the near - constant values of surface brightness and size as a function of @xmath28 for each type .",
    "larger @xmath28 then corresponds to larger projected area and more exposed galaxy .",
    "such a correlation is expected to appear whether or not we select against the face - on versions of the lowest surface brightness galaxies .",
    "it would not appear if the galaxies were optically thin , but the largest increase is for the bcds , which probably have the most opacity .",
    "the bottom part of figure [ fig - babmva_longrd ] suggests that ( b@xmath13v)@xmath75 for bcd galaxies reddens with increasing @xmath28 . this color does not change noticeably for the other types .",
    "the origin of this seems to follow from the radial distribution of colors for bcds ( see figure [ fig - shallowouter_bcd ] below ) if the inner starburst parts of these galaxies are more spherical than the outer old red disk .",
    "then the change from edge - on to face - on will brighten up the red outer disk but not brighten the inner blue starburst as much .",
    "the result is an overall redder color along with the total brightening for more face - on cases .",
    "the integrated colors are shown in color - color plots : ubv in figure [ fig - ubv ] , jhk in figure [ fig - jhk ] , and vjh in figure [ fig - vjh ] .",
    "the irregular galaxies are bluer in ubv than spirals , as is well known ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs , & buta 1983 )",
    ". there is , however , a large range0.5 mag  in the ubv colors within the sample . in j@xmath13h , the colors fall between those of an h@xmath1ii  region , which represents a very young stellar population , and those of a globular cluster , which represents a very old stellar population .",
    "the spirals that were observed for comparison lie near the globular cluster .",
    "the h@xmath13k colors of these objects are not well separated .",

    "show a radial gradient in at least one color .",
    "surface photometry with a gradient that could be equally well fit with a constant color within the uncertainties is not counted .",
    "also , a variation from a constant color of only 12 annuli was not counted as a gradient since these are probably due to individual star - forming complexes .",
    "gradients are also seen in 13 of 24 bcds ( 54% ) and 14 of 18 ( 78% ) of our sms . for these galaxies ,",
    "the color gradients are given in table [ tab - colgrad ] .",

    "most of the i m galaxies , covering the entire range of observed m@xmath12 , have zero gradients .",
    "however , for those galaxies in our sample that do exhibit gradients , we see that the color gradient correlates with m@xmath12 only in the sense that the sm galaxies are both systematically more luminous and also systematically have negative color gradients ( redder in the central regions ) .",
    "similarly , there is a correlation of color gradient with r@xmath49 only in the sense that the sm systems extend to bigger systems compared to bcds and i m galaxies and dominate the negative side of the plot .",
    "however , it is plausible that the spiral galaxies , which are more luminous and larger than our sample galaxies , would extend the sm part of parameter space on our plots , placing our sample as part of the correlations seen by these researchers .",
    "like , macarthur et al .",
    "we see no correlation with @xmath56 .",
    "another striking feature of some of the survey galaxies is that color gradients are not correlated among the different pass - bands as might be expected if different colors emphasize different stellar populations .",
    "an example of this is shown for ngc 2552 in figure [ fig - colorsvar ] .",
    "in addition , three of the bcds have b@xmath13v and u@xmath13b profiles with opposite gradients .",
    "we have not measured the jhk colors as far out in radius as the ubv colors , so we do not know what the jhk are doing in the outer parts , where one might see changes in the optical colors . however , among the galaxies with j , h , or k measurements in addition to ubv , at least one jhk color , including v@xmath13j , does not show the same sort of general trends or variations as the optical colors in 12 of the i m galaxies , while in another 14 the colors are correlated . among the bcds , 1 shows different passbands doing different things , and in 11 systems the colors track each other . among the sms ,",
    "2 galaxies show different trends in different colors and in 1 they follow the same trend . in most spiral galaxies , on the other hand ,",
    "the colors are strongly correlated ( de jong 1996c ) .",
    "however the color - color diagrams in bell & de jong ( 2000 ) and macarthur et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show kinks in some of the radial profiles of spirals as well .",
    "color gradients are the result of a mixture of stellar age gradients , metallicity gradients , and extinction gradients .",
    "the generally blue centers of the bcds are probably the result of recent star formation following some major inflow of gas ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "the mixed color gradients in the other types may reflect a patchy history of star formation .",
    "extinction gradients should cause all of the disk colors to vary in the same way with radius .",
    "figure [ fig - bruzual ] shows b@xmath13v and v@xmath13j colors from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models using the padova1994 evolutionary tracks and the chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the five different curves are for different metallicities , as indicated by the colored lines . on the left",
    "are the galaxy colors for a single burst stellar population that has aged for the time indicated on the abscissa . on the right",
    "are models with star formation rates decaying exponentially , as @xmath77 , starting 10 gyr ago ( at @xmath78 ) and continuing until today ( at @xmath79 yr ) .",
    "when the decay time is small , the stars are all old and the colors resemble the single stellar population models for large ages . when the decay time is large , the models are like continuous star formation .",
    "starburst models have colors indicated by the low age asymptote in the left - hand panels .",
    "the figure has the usual result that both increasing age and decreasing metallicity cause a population of stars to redden",
    ". however , there are cases where b@xmath13v can get redder while v@xmath13j gets bluer , as observed for 3 of our i m galaxies .",
    "this may happen , for example , when the inner region has a dominant age of @xmath80 yr and a moderately high metallicity ( e.g. @xmath81 ) while the outer region has a dominant age of @xmath82 yr and a lower metallicity .",
    "thus , the changes in color gradients within a galaxy probably reflect the large - scale bubbling of star formation activity around the galaxy over time , and the uncorrelated behavior of colors reflects how recently star formation has occurred in a given annulus .",
    "azimuthally - averaged color profiles are not always an adequate indicator of color structure in the galaxy . for example , color profiles are uniform with radius in ngc 2366 and ngc 4449 . yet , hunter et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001a ) found that both of these barred systems have a bright , blue ridge that crosses from one corner of the rectangular inner bar to the opposite corner .",
    "figure [ fig - cross ] illustrates this with color - ratio images .",
    "these are the only two i m galaxies that we have found that show this kind of color structure , but they do provide a caution that motivated us to carefully examine two - dimensional color - color ratio maps of each galaxy in our sample .",
    "( all of the color ratio images are available from http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/colormaps/ ) .    for most of our galaxies",

    "the optical ubv ratio images are punctuated with blue spots that correspond to h@xmath1ii  regions while the jhk ratio images do not show structure .",
    "some variations from this picture are the natural consequence of variations in the evolutionary status of individual star - forming regions . in some galaxies , especially the bcds ,",

    "the disks measured at high redshift show breaks at about 1.8 scale - lengths ( prez 2004 ) , more like the i m galaxies than local spirals .    in table",
    "[ tab - twomu ] we also present the ratio of the inner scale - length r@xmath99 to outer scale - length r@xmath100 in v - band for the two - part exponentials . in pohlen",
    "et al.s spirals this ratio is 2.0@xmath470.2 which is similar to the ratio for our i m and sm galaxies with the steepening exponential disk .",
    "van der kruit and shostak s ratios bracket pohlen s ratio with values of 1.6 and 2.6 .    what causes this break in the surface brightness profile ?",
    "we compared the locations of the break to the h@xmath7  surface brightness profiles in order to see what was happening with the star formation activity at that radius .",
    "we see that , of the 40 galaxies with complex profiles , in 15 most of the detectable h@xmath7  ends within one annulus of the location of the break . in another 18 galaxies ,",
    "the h@xmath7  surface photometry drops more rapidly beginning approximately around r@xmath43 .",
    "thus , in 83% of these galaxies there is some change in @xmath89 , and this would be a satisfying explanation to the change in stellar surface brightness .",
    "however , in 7 of the galaxies the h@xmath7  profile does not change or h@xmath7  ends well before the break .",
    "furthermore , there are 30 ims ( 32% ) , 11 ( 46% ) bcds , and 1 ( 6% ) sm that also exhibit a change in the drop off rate of @xmath89 or h@xmath7  ends well before @xmath31 , and yet they do not show a break in their v - band surface brightness profiles .",
    "pohlen et al .  (",
    "2002 ) also could not find a convincing correlation with h@xmath7  in spirals .",
    "h@xmath7  is a measure of the current star formation , whereas the broad - band colors integrate the star formation over longer periods of time .",
    "therefore , one might expect a better correlation between the breaks in the surface brightness profiles and changes in color profiles . among those galaxies with nearly flat inner profiles",
    "5 of 10 show a change in b@xmath13v where the break in @xmath31 occurs .",
    "all of these become redder beyond the break . of those with an exponential that becomes steeper ,",
    "7 become redder after the break , 1 becomes bluer , and 11 do not change .",
    "the galaxy with the flat outer profile shows no change in color with radius .",
    "we have also compared the broad - band and h@xmath7  surface photometry to the surface density of the neutral gas @xmath101 .",
    "we plot @xmath31 , @xmath89 , and @xmath101 in figure [ fig - withhi ] for all survey galaxies with h@xmath1i  surface density profiles @xmath101 available from the literature ( see the references listed in the figure caption ) .",
    "this includes three galaxies with breaks in their exponential profiles ( ddo 75 , ddo 105 , and ddo 168 ) and 9 that have single exponential profiles .",
    "one can see that azimuthally - averaged @xmath101 has very little correspondence with what is going on in the optical , including the breaks in the exponential profiles , as well as changes in ubvjhk colors ( not shown in the figure but discussed in  4.3.3 ) . generally , @xmath101 changes very slowly over the optical galaxy , and when the change is more rapid , there is no correspondence with optical changes .",
    "similarly , there is no correlation between where the break in the surface brightness profile occurs and changes in the h@xmath1i  rotation curve of the galaxy ( from the references in the caption to figure [ fig - withhi ] and swaters 1999 ) .",
    "the break occurs after the rotation curve turns over in 5 galaxies , during the solid body part of the rotation curve in 4 galaxies , and about at the turn over in the rotation curve in 1 galaxy .",
    "five galaxies show no measurable rotation .    in a separate paper ( elmegreen & hunter 2005 ) we present a model of star formation in outer galaxy disks that reproduces the observed double exponential profile and the correlation between break radius and galaxy magnitude .",
    "the model is based on the concept that both gravitational instabilities and compression trigger star formation , and that in the outer disk , beyond the kennicutt ( 1989 ) surface density threshold , only the compression from low level turbulence and sporadic supernovae remain .",
    "because of this , the star formation rate in the outer disk does not drop suddenly at the threshold , but has a more gradual , exponential - like decline .",
    "dalcanton et al .  ( 2004 ) proposed that large spiral galaxies have thin dust and gas layers and small irregulars have thick dust and gas layers or no obvious dust layers because the large galaxies are more gravitationally unstable and this enhanced instability makes the gaseous velocity dispersions in those galaxies smaller .",
    "while it may be that spirals are more unstable than irregulars (  1 ) , this is probably not the explanation for the difference in gas layer thickness . as recognized by dalcanton et al .",
    ", thickness depends only on the velocity dispersion and gravitational acceleration perpendicular to the plane , while stability depends on the epicyclic frequency as well .",
    "thus thin gas layers can be in either stable or unstable disks , as can thick gas layers , depending on the ratio of the perpendicular crossing time ( which is the thickness divided by the velocity dispersion ) to the epicyclic time .",
    "this ratio is the toomre stability parameter @xmath102 .",
    "figure [ fig - histsb25 ] suggests that the reason for the dalcanton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) correlation between gas layer thickness and galaxy type is that normal spirals have @xmath103 times higher surface densities than irregular galaxies , corresponding to a difference in surface brightness of 2.8 magnitudes in 1 arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , the velocity dispersions of the gas ( @xmath88 ) do not vary much among these different types , regardless of stability .",
    "thus , the gaseous scale height , which is proportional to @xmath104 , is high in irregulars because the surface density is low .",
    "this is related to our previous observation that the general interstellar medium pressure is lower in irregulars than in spirals ( elmegreen & hunter 2000 ) : the larger scale height makes the average space density lower and the pressure lower for a given gas column density and velocity dispersion .    in a disk composed of both gas and stars with small ratios of the gaseous to stellar ( @xmath105 ) velocity dispersions and masses , the gravitational acceleration perpendicular to the plane is determined mostly by stars and it increases linearly with height @xmath106 approximately as @xmath107 for constant @xmath108 ( this is an approximation to the @xmath109 distribution of an isothermal stellar disk of scale height @xmath110 ) . the scale height @xmath111 for the gas is then given by @xmath112 , which reduces to the relation @xmath113 .",
    "it follows that an approximate relation between the stellar and gaseous scale heights and velocity dispersions is @xmath114 .",
    "if the gaseous dispersion is somewhat uniform between galaxy types , and the stellar dispersion is higher in large spirals ( dalcanton et al .",
    "2004 ) , then the ratio of the gaseous to the stellar scale heights is smaller in spirals than in irregulars , making the dust lanes look much thinner in spirals compared to the background stellar disk .",
    "the absolute gaseous scale height is also larger in irregulars because the stellar disk thickness is larger (  [ sect : axes ] ) .",
    "all of these differences are unrelated to the degree of disk stability .",
    "another reason dwarf galaxies have imperceptible dust lanes is that the metallicity is low , making the extinction low per unit gas column density , and the line of sight depth is low because of the small galaxy size .",
    "thus , the total opacity to dust is much lower in edge - on dwarfs than in edge - on spirals .",
    "an exception may be for the starburst cores of bcds , which could have a significant opacity because of the high average gas density .",
    "these points suggests that the dalcanton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) correlation between dust lane thickness and galaxy rotation speed may be explained in general terms by variations in the stellar surface density and line - of - sight opacity .",
    "there is no obvious reason for the reported suddenness of the transition at a rotation speed of 120 km s@xmath11 , but it could be from the combination of these two effects .",
    "that is , the interstellar medium for an edge - on galaxy could become nearly optically thin between the center and the edge at about the same rotation speed as the average stellar surface density starts to drop by a factor of 10 . for example , this drop occurs in figure [ fig - mvmu0_primary ] at about m@xmath115 mag , and this corresponds to a rotation curve speed of @xmath116 km s@xmath11 from figure 1 in hunter , hunsberger , & roye ( 2000 ) .",
    "observations of 136 i m , bcd , and sm galaxies have been compiled to provide a large sample for statistical studies of galaxy colors , disk structures , and star formation processes in the most abundant types of galaxies in the universe .",
    "the main results are :    \\1 .",
    "the average and central surface brightnesses of i m galaxies are generally lower than in spiral galaxies by a factor of @xmath117 ( @xmath118 mag in 1 arcsec@xmath119 ) . the extrapolated central surface brightness for the main exponential part of the disk begins to drop below the standard freeman value for spirals at @xmath120 fainter than @xmath121 mag . the low surface brightness of i m galaxies makes their disks and dust lanes thicker than in spirals , as observed by dalcanton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "overall , i m galaxies are bluer than spirals .",
    "however , they show a wide range of colors , complex color gradients , and complex color patterns , indicating an irregular mixture of stellar population ages , extinctions , and possibly metallicity gradients .",
    "large - scale variations in colors",
    "are clear indications of the manner in which star formation can bubble around the galaxy on scales of kiloparsecs .    \\3",
    ". a normal fraction of i m galaxies are barred ( 23% of our ims , 12% of our bcds , and 50% or our sms ) , but these bars tend to be larger than in spirals , relative to the disk scale length , sometimes occupying the entire bright part of the disk .",
    "the bars are also clearly associated with an excess of star formation in the i m galaxies .",
    "the bars are not often offset from the center of the galaxy .",
    "\\4 . in spite of a bias against obviously interacting systems in our sample , approximately one - third of the i m systems",
    "show large - scale morphological peculiarities that may be an indication of past interactions .",
    "the radial profiles of surface brightness are usually well represented by an exponential over a large fraction of the disk , but many galaxies show two exponentials or other complex patterns . some have flat profiles in the inner regions and a single exponential beyond that , others have two exponentials with either the inner one shallower or the inner one steeper .",
    "the cases with steeper inner exponentials also have significant blue excesses there , indicative of recently enhanced star formation in the centers .",
    "the cases with shallow inner exponentials show no obvious indications of their origin in peculiar star formation patterns , color gradients , h@xmath1i  profiles , or rotation curve features .",
    "star formation models that combine gravitational instabilities with turbulence compression reproduce these profile features ( elmegreen & hunter 2005 ) .",
