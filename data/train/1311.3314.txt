    "the dynamics of open quantum systems attracts nowadays considerable attention .",
    "it is relevant not only for a better understanding of quantum theory but it is fundamental in various modern applications of quantum mechanics such as quantum communication , cryptography , computation and quantum metrology .",
    "any realistic quantum system is an _",
    "open system _ since it always interacts with its environment or",
    " rest of the world \" .",
    "the proper descriptions of such systems is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "there are several excellent books @xcite and review articles @xcite devoted to this subject . in this paper",
    "we provide an introduction to the dynamics of open quantum systems based on local - in - time master equation .",
    "there are several approaches to the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "it is clear that each description presents a departure from the standard von neumann equation @xmath0\\ , \\ ] ] which governs the evolution of the _ closed system _ fully characterized by the system hamiltonian @xmath1 ( by @xmath2 we denote the density operator ( density matrix ) at time @xmath3  see the next section for the notation ) and @xmath4 throughout the paper . introducing a linear map acting on the space of density operators ( sometimes called a _ superoperator _ ) @xmath5 $ ] the von neumann equation may be rewritten in a more compact way as @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is called a _ generator _ of the evolution . a natural way to depart from the world of _ closed systems _",
    "is to change the corresponding equation of motion by changing the generator .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide basic introduction to so called time - local master equation @xmath8 which is fully characterized by the time - dependent generator @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , von neumann equation is a special case of this general scheme .",
    "there is an alternative approach ( see e.g. @xcite ) which is based on the following non - local equation @xmath10 fully characterized by the so called _ memory kernel _ @xmath11 .",
    "usually , the non - local character of ( [ nm ] ) is attributed to the presence of quantum memory effects : this simply means that the rate of change of the state @xmath2 at time @xmath3 depends on its history ( starting at @xmath12 ) .",
    "note that time - local master equation ( [ m ] ) with constant generator @xmath7 is reobtained when @xmath13 .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in the theory of open quantum systems is to find conditions on @xmath9 and @xmath11 that ensure that solutions to ( [ m ] ) and ( [ nm ] ) are physically legitimate . in the present paper we deal with conditions for time - local generator @xmath9 only .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that the problem of necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath9 is open . our aim is to show why this problem is difficult , what is already known and what are the perspectives .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce basic notation and recall basic notions we use in this paper like states , linear positive maps , quantum channels and all that .",
    "section [ sec - how ] provides the description of quantum evolution in terms of time - local master equation .",
    "sections [ sec - c1 ] , [ sec - c2 ] and [ sec - c3 ] characterize classes of local generators for which the corresponding conditions for @xmath9 may be easily formulated .",
    "we analyze time independent generators characterizing markovian semigroups in section [ sec - c1 ] , so called commutative dynamics in section [ sec - c2 ] , and markovian evolution in section [ sec - c3 ] .",
    "section [ sec - gen ] provides a discussion on the general structure of time - local generator : we analyze a simple qubit dynamics to show an intricate structure of the corresponding local generator .",
    "final conclusions are collected in the last section .",
    "we begin by introducing basic notation and terminology .      in this paper",
    "we consider a quantum system living in finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath14 isomorphic to @xmath15 .",

    ". any density matrix may be therefore decomposed as follows @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 provides a probability distribution .",
    "it should be stressed that the above decomposition is highly non - unique .    to illustrate a concept of density operators let us consider the following    a 2-level system ( qubit ) living in @xmath31 . any hermitian operator @xmath19 may be decomposed as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pauli matrices .",
    "as usual @xmath35 denotes a unit matrix in @xmath18 .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that @xmath19 is entirely characterized by the bloch vector @xmath36 .",
    "this representation already guaranties that @xmath22 .",
    "hence , @xmath19 represents density operator if and only if the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath37 are non - negative .",

    "one finds @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a projector complementary to @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 . since any @xmath77 is a convex combination of rank-1 projectors it proves the positivity of @xmath81 .",
