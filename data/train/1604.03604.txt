    "higher - curvature corrected theories of gravity are an interesting alternative to einstein gravity . in higher than four - dimensional spacetimes , the low - energy limit of the heterotic string theory predicts the gauss - bonnet - type ( second order in curvature ) correction to the einstein action .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory shows a number of qualitatively new interesting features .",
    "first , unlike schwarzschild or kerr black holes , small black holes in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory are unstable against small gravitational perturbations @xcite .",
    "the graviton can experience time advance when gauss - bonnet corrections are taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "the anti - de sitter spacetime , which is unstable against nonlinear perturbations in einstein gravity @xcite , restores stability in the gauss - bonnet theory @xcite .",
    "finally , hawking radiation of even softly gauss - bonnet - corrected black holes occurs at the evaporation rate which is many orders slower than that of the black hole in the higher - dimensional einstein theory @xcite .",
    "special attention in the literature is devoted to the issue of gravitational stability of black holes ( see reviews in @xcite and references therein ) , because stability is a necessary criterium of viability of a black hole s model .",
    "analytical analysis of black holes ( in)stability is not an easy task even for relatively simple black - hole solutions , so that for the most of cases numerical treatment through consideration of the black hole oscillation ( _ quasinormal _ ) spectrum @xcite comes into play .",
    "the quasinormal modes of black holes were extensively studied by theorists during the past years .",
    "now there is a strong indication that quasinormal modes have been recently experimentally observed in the gravitational - wave signal from an event that might be a merger of binary black - hole system @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that the gravitational - wave signal is consistent with the einstein theory of gravity . at the same time , the binary black hole evolution was simulated by ligo and virgo collaborations only within the einstein theory , leaving the possible consistency of alternative theories to further investigation @xcite .",
    "simple estimations of orders show that rather large indeterminacy of the black hole s parameters should leave the window for alternative theories of gravity open @xcite .    being an essential criterium for four - dimensional asymptotically flat or de sitter spacetimes , the ( in)stability of black holes in @xmath0-dimensional asymptotically de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes gains additional interest due to the renown gauge - gravity duality , which can be formulated either in terms of ads - cft @xcite or ds - cft @xcite correspondences .",
    "the ( in)stability of asymptotically flat einstein - gauss - bonnet black holes was studied in @xcite where it was shown that the small black holes are unstable against gravitational perturbations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the time - domain picture of evolving of the instability showed that , unlike other black holes instabilities , it develops at relatively late time after a long period of damped quasinormal oscillations @xcite .",
    "further study of the black holes instability for the lovelock generalization @xcite of gauss - bonnet gravity was performed in @xcite , while quasinormal modes were studied in @xcite .    here",
    "we shall make the next step and analyze ( in)stability of black holes in gauss - bonnet gravity , allowing for the positive , nonzero cosmological constant and corresponding to the de sitter asymptotic - term have also nonasymptotically de sitter solutions , which are not considered here . ] .",
    "higher - dimensional analogue of the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole ( given by the tangherlini - de sitter metric ) is stable in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "here we shall show that this is not so for the gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "looking at the already known instability of asymptotically flat small gauss - bonnet black holes , instability of gauss - bonnet - de sitter solution could also be expected at least in some region of parameters . here",
    "we shall show that in addition to this expected instability , there is a new type of instability which occurs owing to the nonzero cosmological constant and does not take place for asymptotically flat higher - dimensional gauss - bonnet or schwarzschild ( tangherlini ) black holes .",
    "we suppose that this instability , triggered by the @xmath3-term in the gauss - bonnet theory , might have the same origin as the instability of higher - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes , which was found in @xcite and later studied for the regime of large @xcite and arbitrary @xcite numbers of spacetime dimensions @xmath4 . here , through the thorough study of the quasinormal spectrum of gravitational perturbations , we shall find the parametric regions of instabilities of the einstein - gauss - bonnet - de sitter black holes in various spacetime dimensions .",
    "in addition to the stability study , there is another motivation to study quasinormal modes of gauss - bonnet - de sitter black holes . in @xcite ,",
    "s. hod made a proposal stating that there exists a universal bound on the relaxation rate .",
    "according to hod s proposal , in the quasinormal spectrum of any black hole there is always a mode whose damping rate ( given by the absolute value of the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency @xmath5 ) is not higher than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hawking temperature of the black hole .",
    "hod s inequality is satisfied for the asymptotically flat gauss - bonnet ( gb ) as well as for schwarzschild - de sitter black holes ( though for the gb case this check seems never been published ) .",
    "therefore , the natural question would be  whether this inequality is satisfied also for the gauss - bonnet - de sitter solution .",
    "here we shall show that the scalar type of gravitational perturbations has the fundamental ( lowest damping ) mode which is above hod s minimum . at the same time",
    "the other two ( vector and tensor ) types of perturbations satisfy the inequality .",
    "we shall argue that this rather signifies the nonviolation of hod s proposal by the gauss - bonnet - de sitter black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ft ] , the main information about the einstein - gauss - bonnet - de sitter background is given .",
    "section  [ sec : grav ] briefly reviews the perturbation equations and the main properties of the master wave equations .",
    "section  [ sec : timeint ] is devoted to description of the numerical time - domain integration method which we used for analysis of evolution of perturbations .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] relates the obtained results and the found regions of instability .",
    "section  [ sec : hod ] discusses the obtained data for quasinormal modes and the validity of hod s proposal . in the conclusion ,",
    "we sketch the obtained results and ongoing work in this direction .",
    "the natural generalization of the einstein theory of gravity to the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime was carried out by lovelock @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian has the following form ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the @xmath4-dimensional kronecker delta and riemann tensors , @xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath12 are arbitrary constants of the theory .    here we shall be limited by the well - known gauss - bonnet theory , that is the lovelock theory truncated at the second - order term in the curvature .",
    "we use geometrized units @xmath13 and define @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this limit describes the low - energy regime of the heterotic string theory .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet lagrangian takes the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a positive coupling constant .    as part of the lovelock theory ,",
    "gauss - bonnet gravity is self - consistent in five and six dimensions . in a more general context , which includes string theory and gauge / gravity duality , we do not need to be always limited by the @xmath19 cases only .",
    "thus , although we shall concentrate on five- and six - dimensional cases , part of our computations will include higher than six - dimensional black holes .",
    "an exact static vacuum solution of the einstein - gauss - bonnet equations can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-dimensional line element of @xmath23 manifold of constant curvature @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27\\equiv\\frac{\\alpha n ( n - 1 ) ( n - 2)}{4 } \\psi^2 + \\frac{n}{2}\\psi - \\frac{\\lambda}{n + 1 } = \\frac{\\mu}{r^{n + 1}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a positive constant proportional to the black - hole mass .",
    "this quadratic equation has two solutions , given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 . in this paper",
    "we shall study only the asymptotically de sitter solutions , i.e. ,  when @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "various properties of this metric were , in particular , studied in @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the accurate computation of @xmath26 requires higher precision for the arithmetic operations . in order to decrease the relative error in ( [ psi ] ) we use its alternative equivalent form ( for @xmath31 ) @xmath33 which apparently allows us to perform all the computations using standard 32-bits floating - point arithmetics .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath34 limit of gauss - bonnet gravity leads to the higher - dimensional solution of the einstein theory  schwarzschild - tangherlini spacetime @xcite @xmath35    for @xmath36 we have a compact ( spherical ) black hole with the event horizon radius @xmath37 , which corresponds to the smallest positive root of the equation @xmath38 . measured in units of length for any value of @xmath4 , this quantity is convenient for parametrization of the black hole mass , which can be expressed as @xmath39 in the de sitter spacetimes the span of the spatial coordinate is limited by the cosmological horizon @xmath40 , which we use in order to parametrize the cosmological constant as @xmath41    in the limit @xmath42 we obtain the extremal value of the cosmological constant , which is given as follows @xmath43 limit @xmath44 corresponds to the asymptotically flat spacetime ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "hereafter , we measure all the quantities in units of the event horizon , i.e. ,  we introduce dimensionless parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while frequencies are measured in the units of inverse horizon radius @xmath48 .",
    "the linear perturbations @xmath49 around the background @xmath50 ( [ gbg4 ] ) can be written as @xmath51    taking the variation of the einstein - gauss - bonnet equations for vacuum solutions , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 one can find the gauss - bonnet contribution to the einstein tensor . then it is convenient to represent the tensor components of @xmath49 with respect to the transformation law under rotations on the @xmath55-sphere .",
    "the linear perturbations , then , can be classified into _",
    "tensor _ , _ vector _ , and _",
    "scalar _ types , each of which can be treated independently from the others . after a lot of algebra and separation of variables",
    "@xcite , the perturbation equations can be reduced to a number of second - order master differential equations with some effective potentials , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the tortoise coordinate , @xmath58 and @xmath59 stands for @xmath60 ( tensor ) , @xmath61 ( vector ) , and @xmath62 ( scalar ) perturbations .",
    "the explicit forms of the effective potentials @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are given @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the multipole number and @xmath68",
    "in our case the dynamical wave equation has a cumbersome form . therefore",
    ", proving of ( in)stability analytically is a difficult task , so that numerical analysis of the quasinormal spectrum must be undertaken instead . the most straightforward way to achieve",
    "this is to use the integration of the master equation in the time domain which takes into consideration contributions from all the modes .",
    "we shall use here the discretization scheme proposed by gundlach , price , and pullin @xcite .",
    "this method was used for calculation of quasinormal modes in a great number of works @xcite .",
    "comparisons of the time - domain numerical data with the accurate frequency - domain calculations show excellent agreement not only in cases when a black hole is stable , but also near the onset of instability ( see for example @xcite ) . rewriting ( [ gp9 ] ) in terms of the light - cone",
    "coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one finds @xmath71    the discretization scheme has the following form @xmath72+\\mathcal{o}(\\delta^4),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the points of a square in a grid with step @xmath77 in the discretized @xmath78-@xmath61 plane : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . with the initial data specified on two null surfaces @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 , we are able to find values of the function @xmath85 at each of the points of the grid",
    ". since quasinormal modes and the asymptotical behavior of perturbations do not depend on initial conditions ( as confirmed by several numerical simulations ) , we shall consider the gaussian wave initial data on the @xmath61-axes ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this discretization scheme requires a number of operations which is proportional to @xmath86 , what implies that the corresponding accumulated error is @xmath87 . by decreasing the step @xmath77 for the same initial data",
    ", we check the convergence of the integration scheme . here",
    "we present the resulting profiles for the sufficiently small step @xmath77 , such that its further decreasing does not change the time - domain picture .",
    "another source of error comes from numerical truncations in computations . in order to check the stability of the algorithm",
    ", we compare the profiles found with the floating - point arithmetics of different precision .",
    "in particular , we observe that the single - precision ( 32-bits ) arithmetics is sufficient for our computations . we have also compared the obtained time - domain profiles for @xmath45 with those obtained with the high - precision code in @xcite and found that the difference is smaller than the discretization - scheme error order .    in order to catch the threshold of instability , we had to obtain a great number of time - domain profiles for various values of parameters .",
    "a typical damped ( stable ) and growing ( unstable ) time - domain profiles near the threshold of instability are shown on fig .  [ profile-1 ] .",
    "here we shall consider the results of our numerical time - domain integration in terms of stability or instability of gauss - bonnet - de sitter black holes at various values of parameters .",
    "we observed instability in scalar and tensor channels of perturbations , while the vector sector showed no growing time - domain profiles .",
    "the effective potential for the tensor - type perturbations has a negative gap outside the black hole , near its event horizon .",
    "although , intuitively , increasing of the multipole number @xmath88 should lead to a higher barrier of the effective potential , this is not the only effect that comes from increasing of @xmath88 .",
    "the higher @xmath88 is , the deeper the negative gap , so that , quite conterintuitively , the higher @xmath88 are more unstable .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the instability region in the tensor channel , we have to consider the limit @xmath89 , corresponding to the most unstable solution . in order to distinguish this instability , which develops at higher @xmath88",
    ", we shall call it the _ eikonal instability _ , emphasizing the fact that the regime of geometrical optics @xmath90 corresponds to the most unstable solution .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that for lovelock theories the negative - energy bound state in the @xmath89 limit exists in the region ( outside the black - hole horizon ) for which the initial conditions _ on spacelike surfaces _ can not be consistently imposed .",
    "although , for the initial conditions on the _ null surfaces _ considered in the present paper , the solutions of the equation ( [ timedomain ] ) are well - defined ( yet summing over @xmath88 is divergent ) and correspond to unstable time - domain profiles .",
    "thus , the parametric region of what we call `` the eikonal instability '' coincides exactly with the region where the perturbation equations become nonhyperbolic .",
    "however , for practical purposes , within a linear approximation it does not matter whether the configuration is unstable or has the region where the initial conditions are ill - defined . in the regime of small perturbations , we are unable to tell what occurs once we observe a profile infinitely growing in time .",
    "however , we are able to demonstrate the parametric region in which the black holes are stable and find the onset of instability ( at which he damping rate approaches zero ) .",
    "as the problem of non - hyperbolicity of the perturbation equations occurs only when the `` eikonal instabilty '' takes place , this gives us an additional reason to distinguish the `` eikonal instability '' from the other type of instability which is not related to this problem .    from fig .",
    "[ tensor-6 ] , we can see that small black holes are always unstable against tensor - type perturbations in @xmath2 spacetimes . for higher @xmath4 , as well as for @xmath1 ,",
    "tensor - type perturbations show no instability",
    ". apparently , the critical value of the fraction @xmath91 , corresponding to the threshold of instability at a given @xmath92 , approaches to some constant for large @xmath92 . in this sense , there should exist a minimum value of @xmath91 , designated as @xmath93 , such that black holes with @xmath94 are stable against tensor perturbations in gauss - bonnet gravity for any values of the coupling constant @xmath92 .      analyzing the time - domain profiles , we see that unboundedly growing perturbations , signifying the instability , correspond to the nonoscillatory regime near the threshold of instability .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the statement , proved in @xcite , that _",
    "unstable modes can not be oscillatory _ when perturbing spherically symmetric static black holes .    in the gravitational perturbations of the scalar type we observe the new instability for all @xmath95 .",
    "this instability occurs for sufficiently large value of the gb - coupling and cosmological constant ( fig .",
    "[ instabilitys ] ) . unlike the eikonal instability it occurs for the lowest multipole number @xmath96 and ,",
    "therefore , is not related to the above mentioned nonhyperbolicity problem of perturbation equations . since this instability does not take place for asymptotically flat gauss - bonnet black holes we shall call it , for briefness , _",
    "@xmath3-instability_.    scalar - type gravitational perturbations of the five - dimensional black holes are different from higher - dimensional cases , because only in @xmath1 spacetimes both types of instability , the eikonal one and the @xmath3-instability , take place . from fig .",
    "[ instabilitys5 ] , we can see that there are two regimes of instability :    * _ small _ @xmath1 black holes are unstable once the gb - coupling is larger than some critical value ( for a given @xmath91 ) @xmath97 the instability region is dominated by the eikonal @xmath89 regime . *",
    "_ large _ @xmath1 black holes are unstable for values of the coupling @xmath92 above some critical ( at a given @xmath91 ) .",
    "this instability happens only @xmath96 modes .",
    "close to @xmath98 @xmath99 both types of instability `` merge '' in such a way , that there seems to be no values of @xmath100 for which the black hole is stable for _ arbitrary gb - coupling _ , like it happens in @xmath2 tensor - type mode .",
    ".scalar type of gravitational perturbations : critical values of @xmath92 corresponding to the threshold of instability . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "several years ago shahar hod formulated an interesting proposal @xcite stating that the _ damping rate of the fundamental quasinormal frequency _ of any black hole in nature is constrained by the value of its hawking temperature in a specific way .",
    "namely , he argued that @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the hawking temperature . for static spherically symmetric black holes @xmath103 using numerical and analytical results for quasinormal modes of four- and higher - dimensional schwarzschild @xcite , schwazrschild - de sitter @xcite and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter black holes @xcite , hod illustrated that his inequality is fulfilled for asymptotically flat black holes as well as for nonasymptotically flat ones .",
    "the arguments were based on semiclassical consideration and thermodynamic ideas .",
    "it is tempting to understand whether hod s proposal is valid for more general black hole solutions . in our case , we choose the @xmath1 gauss - bonnet - de sitter black hole in the range of parameters which corresponds to a gravitationally stable configuration .",
    "the breakdown of the inequality at the onset of instability would be a perfect proof of the proposal .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ qnmt ] we noticed that the lowest mode of the scalar type of gravitational perturbations has the imaginary part @xmath104 for which    @xmath105    for @xmath106 in the range @xmath107 , which is inside the stability region according to fig .",
    "[ instabilitys5 ] .",
    "nevertheless , vector and tensor perturbations in the stable sector ( for @xmath108 ) , unlike scalar perturbations , do not break down the conjecture , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ qnmtvt ] .",
    "thus , if we admit that it is possible to `` create '' perturbation in such a way that only the scalar type of gravitational perturbation would be excited , while vector- and tensor - type gravitational modes would have zero excitation factors , the counterexample for this proposal would be provided . even though all three types of perturbations can be treated completely separately within the linear approximation",
    ", we do not believe that it would be possible to prepare such process of `` purely scalar - type gravitational perturbation '' in a real process .",
    "the main reason for this is that such an ideal separation of gravitational perturbations into three independent channels ( scalar , vector , and tensor ) is impossible taking into account the essentially nonlinear nature of the real perturbation process .",
    "such a separation into three channels would also be impossible even in the linear approximation : although a classical black hole preserves all the geometrical symmetries given by a set of killing vectors , tiny quantum fluctuations definitely break down the exact symmetries .",
    "in other words , if due to specially prepared initial perturbations only one of the channels ( scalar ) is excited , then the other two channels ( vector and tensor ) inevitably acquire some , whatever small , but nonzero , excitations .",
    "therefore , by showing that at least some of the types of gravitational perturbations obey hod s proposal , we rather confirm the proposal than disprove it .",
    "this certainly does not mean that counter - examples can not be found in the future .",
    "we can also see that the higher the value of the @xmath92-coupling , the quicker the hawking temperature grows with respect to the oscillation frequency .",
    "the decay rate of oscillation , @xmath109 , reaches a constant value when approaching the extremal state .",
    "indeed , the imaginary part of the qnm approaches zero for extremal black holes , so that @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "here we have performed a thorough analysis of gravitational quasinormal spectrum of asymptotically de sitter black holes in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "usage of the time - domain integration allowed us to take into consideration contributions of all the modes in the signal and , thereby , to judge about the ( in)stability of the black hole ( what would be much more difficult to do by working in the frequency domain ) .",
    "gravitational perturbations are known to be reduced to the independent master equations for scalar , vector , and tensor types relatively the rotation group on @xmath55-sphere .",
    "it has been shown that the scalar channel of the gravitational perturbation has a new kind of instability at sufficiently large values of the cosmological constant @xmath3 , which we called `` the @xmath3-instability '' , because it does not take place for asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "it is possible that this instability has a similar origin as the instability of the higher - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes @xcite , though there are apparent distinctions between these two instabilities : reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes are unstable in @xmath112-dimensional spacetimes only at relatively large values of the electric charge , while black holes in the gauss - bonnet theory are unstable even being neutral and in @xmath113 and @xmath114 dimensions as well .",
    "in addition , we have found that scalar and tensor channels also have instabilities owing to the nonzero gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "this instability occurs at high multipole numbers @xmath88 and , therefore , was called `` the eikonal instability '' .",
    "it was demonstrated that the quasinormal frequencies of the scalar type of gravitational perturbations do not obey hod s inequality and the lowest mode in this channel of perturbation has higher damping rate than the one prescribed by the proposal",
    ". however , the other two channels , vector and tensor , have lower - lying modes what , thereby , confirms hod s proposal .",
    "apparently , it would be impossible to create the process of perturbation which would excite only the scalar channel and leave unperturbed the other two .",
    "if such a `` selective '' perturbation could be prepared or even theoretically modeled , hod s proposal would be violated .    in the forthcoming papers",
    "@xcite , we shall complete the investigation of the ( in)stabilities of black holes in gauss - bonnet gravity and consider perturbations of the electrically charged asymptotically flat , de sitter , and anti - de sitter black holes in gauss - bonnet gravity . some of these cases require application of different numerical approaches and",

    "<S> analysis of time - domain profiles for gravitational perturbations shows that gauss - bonnet black holes in a de sitter world possess a new kind of dynamical instability which does not take place for asymptotically flat einstein - gauss - bonnet black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the new instability is in the gravitational perturbations of the scalar type and is due to the nonvanishing cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the quasinormal spectrum in the stability sector shows that although the scalar type of gravitational perturbations alone does not obey hod s conjectural bound , connecting the damping rate and the hawking temperature , the vector and tensor types ( and thereby the gravitational spectrum as a whole ) do obey it . </S>"
