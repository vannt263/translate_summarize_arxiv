    "metallic ferromagnetism is one of the oldest problems in solid - state physics . despite all progress in solid - state theory over the last century  @xcite , we are still far away from a definite theory for transition metals like iron , cobalt and nickel .",
    "it is generally accepted that the magnetic order in metals is a consequence of the interplay between the electrons kinetic energy and their mutual coulomb interactions .",
    "therefore , it does not come as a surprise that a complete theory for this many - particle effect is difficult to develop .",
    "nevertheless , it is commonly believed that at least the ground - state properties of itinerant magnets can be described by ( effective ) one - particle theories such as hartree - fock theory or ( spin-)density - functional theory ( sdft ) .",
    "however , serious doubts are in order , as a closer look on available experimental data reveals .",
    "for example , sdft fails to reproduce even qualitatively the electronic band - structure of nickel , one of the simplest itinerant ferromagnets  @xcite ; for a summary , see ref .  .",
    "for iron , the agreement is better but can not be considered as satisfactory either . in any case , the same physical mechanism is acting in both systems , and a convincing theory should cover all elements of the iron group equally well .",
    "single - particle theories are not very satisfactory also from a purely theoretical point of view : it is well known that they significantly overestimate the stability of ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "for example , hartree - fock theory for one - band hubbard models gives a ferromagnetic ground state above some moderate interaction strength .",
    "in contrast , many - body theories show that ferromagnetism in one - band hubbard models occurs , if at all , only for very large coulomb interactions or very peculiar choices of the one - particle density of states  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the stoner mechanism is less prominent in itinerant ferromagnets than implied by single - particle theories .    as already argued by van vleck  @xcite and",
    "confirmed recently  @xcite , an essential ingredient for metallic ferromagnetism is the local ( hunds - rule ) exchange coupling of electrons , a generic feature of electrons in degenerate bands .",
    "in contrast to the one - band case , ferromagnetism occurs for moderate coulomb - interactions in a generic two - band model provided that local hunds - rule terms are included .",
    "therefore , even a qualitative understanding of the 3@xmath0-elements requires a careful consideration of their atomic open - shell structures .    in our recent work  @xcite",
    "we have developed a variational approach which allows us to examine multi - band hubbard models with an arbitrary number of correlated orbitals per lattice site . for a realistic description of the 3@xmath0-elements a minimal model",
    "includes the 3@xmath0 , 4@xmath1 , and 4@xmath2 bands .",
    "when applied to nickel , our theory provides results which agree much better with experiments than all previous sdft - calculation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , our approach reproduces the experimental fermi - surface topology of nickel and removes all other qualitative sdft deficiencies .",
    "since our variational many - body approach provides a reasonable description of the ground state , it may serve as an appropriate starting point for the study of excitations in itinerant ferromagnets .    as observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite , the spectrum of itinerant ferromagnets displays low - lying spin - wave excitations .",
    "these excitations are generally considered to be the driving force for the transition from the ferromagnetic phase into the paramagnetic phase at the curie temperature .",
    "therefore , their correct description is also very important for our understanding of finite - temperature properties of itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "unfortunately , almost all established theories which are used for the analysis of spin - waves in transition metals are based on effective single - particle theories which do not necessarily provide a satisfactory description of the ground state .",
    "the textbook approach to the problem of itinerant ferromagnetism is a hartree - fock theory for the ground state which is then combined with a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the description of spin - excitations  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .   the rpa - method has been applied to iron and nickel starting from a sdft calculation for the ground state .",
    "later , a similar method has been used to analyze data from electron energy - loss spectroscopy for the same materials  @xcite .",
    "another common approach starts from energy calculations for static spin deformations of the ferromagnetic ground state within the sdft .",
    "the spin - wave energies are identified as the energy difference between these `` frozen - magnon '' states and the ground state@xcite . despite their conceptual shortcomings both sdft - based approaches",
    "are able to reproduce the experimental data surprisingly well .",
    "very recently  @xcite one of us has proposed a spin - wave theory which starts from the variational ground state of multi - band hubbard models as introduced in ref .  .",
    "this theory allows us to determine the spin - wave spectrum for systems with an arbitrary number of correlated orbitals per lattice site .",
    "the main advantage of this new approach lies in its foundation on a true many - particle description of the ground state . in this way",
    ", we are able to provide a consistent picture of the ferromagnetic fermi liquid and its spin - wave excitations .    in order to obtain a better understanding of our own but likewise of the sdft - based methods it is crucial to apply them for a generic but simple model system .",
    "to our knowledge such an analysis has not been performed yet .",
    "even a comparison between the two well - established sdft methods is still lacking . in this work",
    "we analyze the hartree - fock / rpa theory and compare it with our variational many - body approach .",
    "although the rpa is generally considered as the `` standard '' method for the description of magnetic excitations in itinerant ferromagnets   there exists no systematic derivation for multi - band hubbard models . in sect .",
    "[ rand ] , we derive the general rpa equations from a decoupling scheme and a standard diagrammatic viewpoint .    in sect .",
    "[ comp ] we provide numerical results for a generic two - band model and show that both methods lead to qualitatively different results . for generic values of the magnetization , the hartree - fock /",
    "rpa treatment incorrectly predicts an instability of the collinear ferromagnetic phase against some spiral ordering . in our variational approach",
    "the spin - waves always have positive energy and their stiffness decreases with increasing correlations .",
    "the case of a one - band model with fully polarized bands allows us to pinpoint the origin of these discrepancies : the hartree - fock theory allows for ferromagnetism with small local moments and large longitudinal spin - fluctuations due to stoner excitations .",
    "these are actually absent in a realistic correlated - electron description where charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",

    "for the same set of parameters @xmath112 and @xmath110 the underlying ground states are completely different and , therefore , a comparison of the spin - wave properties would not make sense .",
    "thus , it appears to be more reasonable to consider the results of both methods for the same magnetization per band , @xmath119 the density of electrons per band and spin direction in the paramagnetic phase is given by @xmath120 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the variational spin - wave dispersion in @xmath121-direction is shown for four different magnetizations .",
    "here we used the same tight - binding parameters as in our analysis of the ground - state properties in  .",
    "the average electron density per orbital and spin direction in the paramagnet is @xmath122 .",
    "we keep the ratio @xmath123 fixed and consider different values @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 ( bandwidth @xmath128 ) which correspond to a magnetization per band of @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "the last value belongs to the almost fully polarized ferromagnet ( @xmath133 ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the spin - wave dispersion drastically depends on the magnetization . the data can be fitted very well to @xmath134 in qualitative agreement with experiments on iron - group metals . in the case of a strong ferromagnet",
    ", we obtain @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "this is the right order of magnitude in nickel where @xmath139 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the spin - wave dispersion is almost isotropic which also agrees with experimental observations . in our variational",
    "many - body approach , the spin - wave stiffness _",
    "decreases _ as a function of  @xmath110 .",
    "this does not come as a surprise because the effective coupling between the sites decreases when the electron hopping between the sites becomes less effective .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the results for the spin - wave dispersion in the rpa are shown for three different values of  @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast to our variational approach , the rpa predicts a _ negative _ slope of the dispersion for non - saturated ferromagnetism , @xmath140 .",
    "note that for @xmath141 the system has just attained the fully polarized state ( compare fig .",
    "7 of ref .  ) .",
    "but even in this case , a well - defined rpa spin - wave excitation does not yet exist .",
    "it requires a further increase of  @xmath110 until the fully polarized collinear hartree - fock ground state appears to be stable . since the rpa probes the ` local ' stability of a mean - field state it is conceivable that another ferromagnetic hartree - fock state with some spiral order has a lower energy than the collinear state",
    ". however , ferromagnetic phases with spiral order are not generic for transition metals .",
    "we argue that this prediction of exotic ferromagnetic spin structures is an artifact of the hartree - fock approach .",
    "in fact , as we have demonstrated for our two - band model  @xcite , hartree - fock theory predicts ferromagnetism in regions of the @xmath142  phase diagram where the paramagnetic phase is actually stable .    in the case of a stable collinear ferromagnetic hartree - fock ground state ,",
    "the rpa spin - wave stiffness _ increases _ as a function of  @xmath110 , again in contrast to our variational approach . for all generic cases",
    ", @xmath143 holds in the limit of infinite coupling . in our case , @xmath144 , as compared to @xmath145 .",
    "the variational and rpa results differ significantly in the strong - coupling limit , too . nevertheless , there are some intermediate coupling strengths @xmath146 , @xmath147 where the variational and the rpa spin - wave stiffness agree .",
    "such accidental agreements may also occur when rpa results are compared to experimental data .    in some special cases where the fully polarized state is a one - particle product state we find @xmath148 for all finite values of @xmath110 , @xmath112 , and @xmath149 for large couplings .",
    "this is also the case in the one - band system ; see below .",
    "the study of the one - band model allows us to elucidate the origin of the qualitatively different results for the spin - wave dispersion . in the case of the one - band model ,",
    "@xmath150 the results of sect .",
    "[ rand ] simplify significantly .",
    "the hartree - fock energies can be written as @xmath151 and the susceptibility  ( [ 7.19a ] ) becomes    @xmath152    for the spin - wave energies @xmath153 the denominator in @xmath154 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath155 to the leading ( second ) order in @xmath14 we can expand  ( [ 8.5 ] ) in powers of @xmath156 because @xmath157 is fulfilled for our low - lying spin - wave excitations , see  ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "this expansion leads to @xmath158 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{8.8 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is to be compared with our variational spin - wave dispersion .",
    "however , such a comparison is somewhat questionable , since the existence of a stable ferromagnetic phase is hard to obtain in our variational approach .",
    "nevertheless , let us assume that a given one - band model with a special density of states may have a fully - polarized ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "then we obtain the following expression for the variational spin - wave dispersion @xmath159 this expression differs from @xmath73 in  ( [ 8.8 ] ) by the second term , i.e. , for @xmath160 we find @xmath161 the energy difference @xmath162 is always _ negative _ and vanishes for @xmath163 , i.e. , for @xmath164 .",
    "it is essentially this contribution which eventually leads to negative values of the rpa spin - wave stiffness for finite  @xmath110 in the two - band model .    from a formal point of view",
    "the origin of the differences between both theories is obvious : for a fully polarized ground state of the one - band model the variational dispersion is identical to the _ exact _ first moment of the spectral function @xmath165 .",
    "however , the rpa predicts the existence of spectral weight around @xmath166 , the so - called `` stoner - excitations '' .",
    "thus , the spin - wave pole of the rpa must have a lower energy than @xmath106 , since , otherwise , the rpa could not give the correct first moment of @xmath12 .",
    "for this reason we need to address the issue of whether or not the rpa - theory correctly describes the _ high - energy physics _ of itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "first , it should be noted that the _ existence _ of the energy scale @xmath167 is an artifact of the hartree - fock theory which survives in the rpa . from ground - state concepts like the magnetic condensation energy",
    "we infer that such an energy scale is an artificial feature of mean - field theories , and irrelevant within a many particle description of itinerant ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "second , the misleading _ relevance _ of this energy scale stems from the overestimation of longitudinal fluctuations in mean - field theories .    in order to see the second point",
    ", we consider again the spectral function @xmath12 ,  ( [ swf ] ) , which provides the energy distribution of the spin excitations . in a spin - wave state",
    "the local moments do not depend on momentum , i.e , @xmath168 .",
    "in particular , this implies for the fully polarized one - band model that there are no doubly occupied lattice sites in @xmath169 .",
    "the temporal development of this state is now crucial : in a strongly correlated many - particle system , longitudinal fluctuations are substantially suppressed because charge fluctuations are energetically too costly at large  @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the length of local spins @xmath170 is basically conserved also as a function of time .",
    "our variational method correctly captures this generic behavior : fast longitudinal fluctuations are small and may be neglected at least for small values of  @xmath14 . in contrast , longitudinal fluctuations are always present in mean - field theory since electrons with opposite spin meet each other with non - zero probability .",
    "recall that hartree - fock theory predicts a ferromagnetic ground state for much smaller interaction strengths than a proper many - body treatment .",
    "the presence and importance of considerable longitudinal spin fluctuations within hartree - fock and rpa then leads to the prediction of an instability of the collinear ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath171 ) , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "these findings also explain the qualitatively different behavior of the spin - wave stiffness as a function of  @xmath110 . in the variational approach",
    "we find a stable ferromagnetic ground state with well - defined local moments .",
    "the interaction of these ` spins ' is mediated by hopping processes .",
    "similar to the well - known large-@xmath110 antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath172 in the case of the half - filled hubbard model , we find that the effective spin - coupling @xmath173 in ferromagnets is reduced with increasing  @xmath110 because hopping processes are more and more suppressed as they induce charge fluctuations . note",
    "that the coupling @xmath173 remains finite in the limit @xmath163 because we are dealing with a non - integer band - filling where electron transfers are never completely suppressed .",
    "in contrast to this generic behavior , the hartree - fock theory misleadingly predicts a ferromagnetic ground state already for rather small interaction strengths where local moments are only partially generated .",
    "the rpa dynamics of the ` hartree - fock spins ' is considerably determined by longitudinal fluctuations . with increasing interaction strength the local moments",
    "are stabilized even within hartree - fock theory .",
    "consequently , the rpa spin - wave stiffness increases and eventually overshoots the value from our variational approach .",
    "the basic mechanism for a reduction of @xmath173 in our variational description remains completely hidden in the rpa because the reduction of the electron transfer amplitudes due to the electrons mutual coulomb interaction is not contained in a hartree - fock mean - field approach .",
    "in this work we have derived the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the analysis of spin - wave properties in general multi - band hubbard models with a collinear ferromagnetic ground state . the equation - of - motion technique and the diagrammatic approach lead to identical expressions .",
    "we have applied our analytical results to model systems with one and two correlated orbitals per lattice site .",
    "this allows us to compare the rpa results with those of a recently introduced variational approach to spin - wave excitations of gutzwiller - correlated many - body ground states .",
    "the numerical analysis of the two - band model reveals significant qualitative differences between both methods . in the rpa ,",
    "the spin - wave stiffness is negative for non - saturated ferromagnetism . with increasing correlations the rpa spin - wave energies",
    "are shifted upwards and the rpa spin - wave stiffness eventually becomes positive in the saturated ferromagnet .",
    "our variational correlated - electron approach shows a completely different behavior .",
    "the spin - wave energies are always positive and the spin - wave stiffness decreases with increasing interactions .",
    "the same discrepancies occur in the one - band case where a fully analytical evaluation of the spin - wave dispersions is possible .",
    "we conclude that the hartree - fock / rpa theory provides an inadequate description for spin - wave properties in correlated electron systems . in our view , the main problem is the mean - field character of the underlying hartree - fock theory . in this approach",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state lacks well - developed local moments , and , therefore , high - energy longitudinal fluctuations of the local spins are large and relevant . as a consequence ,",
    "rpa theory predicts an instability of the collinear ferromagnetic ground state against some spiral order .",
    "our many - body approach reveals quite a different picture . in the region of stable ferromagnetism",
    "we find well - defined local moments .",
    "spin excitations in these systems are transversal fluctuations of the local moments whose length is essentially conserved in space and time .",
    "consequently , the stiffness of the variational spin - wave dispersion is always positive and decreases for increasing interaction strength .",
    "the popular `` frozen - magnon '' approximation for the examination of spin - wave excitations in itinerant ferromagnets can be considered as a mean - field theory in which the conservation of the local spins is introduced by hand . in this way ,",
    "the overestimation of longitudinal fluctuations in the hartree - fock / rpa approach is eliminated by construction .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the frozen - magnon approximation would lead to the same results as our variational approach if we chose a hartree - fock variational wave - function instead of our gutzwiller wave - function",
    ". a more detailed analysis of the frozen - magnon approach will be the subject of a forthcoming study  @xcite ."
