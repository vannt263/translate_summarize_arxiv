    "granular flows involving elongated particles are very important in agriculture , industry or natural processes . in a shear flow",
    "the interparticle contact forces often lead to orientational ordering and alignment of the particles .",
    "while the basic properties of granular flows have been widely studied for rapid ( collisional ) , quasistatic and intermediate regimes @xcite , the flow properties of samples consisting of elongated objects is not well understood .",
    "after early experiments on grass seeds @xcite and rice grains @xcite , recent numerical studies focused on shear flows of ellipsoidal particles @xcite .",
    "these latter studies revealed the topology of the contact forces @xcite for sheared ellipsoidal particles and also described how the stresses and the corresponding particle orientations depend on the aspect ratio of the ellipsoids @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have demonstrated the basic properties of the shear induced order focusing on the time and ensemble averaged properties only .",
    "we compared these to various systems including colloids , nanoparticles or nematic liquid crystals .",
    "we have also shown that the shear alignment results in a considerable reduction of the effective friction of the material .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the behavior of individual particles : we detect their rotation induced by the shear flow , and measure the average rotation speed as a function of particle orientation during stationary shear and also during the transient when shear is applied to an initially unoriented or misoriented system .",
    "we also present the basic properties of the shear aligned state for an extended set of materials .",
    "details of our experimental and numerical methods are given .",
    "the granular material was placed in a so called cylindrical split bottom cell ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "in this geometry a circular plate at the bottom of the container is rotated with a constant speed .",
    "if the granular layer is thin enough ( compared to the size of the rotating plate ) the middle part of the granular sample will rotate with the plate like a rigid body .",
    "the outer part of the sample ( near the walls of the cylindrical container ) remains stationary .",
    "the region in between these undisturbed parts is continuously sheared and is called the shear zone ( or shear band ) .",
    "the shear zone is indicated with dark gray in fig .",

    "the length to diameter ( or aspect- ) ratios of the particles were @xmath12 = @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( rice grains ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( glass cylinders ) , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( wooden pegs ) .",
    "two experimental methods were used to visualize and characterize the shear - induced alignment : ( i ) complete 3d imaging of the sample with x - ray computed tomography ( ct ) and ( ii ) optical imaging of the particles at the upper surface of the system with a digital camera .",
    "pegs were investigated by x - ray ct , glass cylinders and rice particles by optical imaging .",
    "the diameter of the rotating plate was @xmath13 , while the container diameter was @xmath14 in both experiments .",
    "we used a typical filling height of @xmath15 .",
    "the complete 3d arrangement of all particles in the shear zone was determined experimentally for three samples ( pegs with @xmath16 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) using x - ray ct @xcite . for these measurements we used a medical angiography system , i.e. , a rotational c - arm based x - ray device equipped with a flat - panel detector .",
    "the spatial resolution of the device was between 1.5  pixel / mm and 2 pixel / mm .",
    "the primary purpose of these experiments was to show that the order and alignment data extracted from surface particles are representative for the global order in the shear zone , with only slight variations .",
    "the particles were detected by applying a watershed algorithm to the recorded images .",
    "the particles orientation was defined as the direction of the largest eigenvector of the individual moment of inertia tensors .",
    "the shear - induced orientational order is monitored by diagonalizing the symmetric traceless order tensor : @xmath17 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a unit vector along the long axis of particle @xmath19 , and the sum is over all @xmath20 detected particles .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of is the primary order parameter @xmath21 .",

    "the top surface of the whole sample was monitored with a digital camera using a frame rate of 18 fps . as an illustration ,",
    "a section of an image is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) .",
    "the shear rate @xmath2 is not constant across the shear zone , but it changes with the radius @xmath3 measured from the center of the cell .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the tangential velocity of the material .",
    "the tangential velocity @xmath25 was determined using a self developed piv ( particle image velocimetry ) code and the time averaged shear rate was calculated .",
    "this shear rate profile is presented in fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) .",
    "the shear zone was divided into about 20 bands ( widths 0.19 cm @xmath26 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) .",
    "the average shear rate was determined for each band .",
    "the orientation and in - plane length of colored tracer grains ( 6@xmath27 of the sample ) were detected , yielding about 60,000 particle positions in each band for each type of grain .",
    "this way , a single experiment with constant rotation speed @xmath28 provides information about the shear rate dependence of the alignment @xcite . in order to cover a wide range of shear rates ,",
    "the experiments were repeated at three different values of @xmath28 .      in order to monitor changes in the mechanical resistance of the sample against shearing , we continuously measured the torque needed to maintain a constant rotation rate of the bottom plate during the evolution of the alignment .",
    "this has been done the following way : the driving motor was mounted on a rotating table . to keep the body of the motor fixed and let the plate rotate in the sample container",
    ", we use a load cell attached to the body of the motor .",
    "we measure the torque needed to hold the motor while the granular material is sheared with a constant speed by the rotating bottom plate .",
    "discrete element method ( dem ) simulations were performed to complement the experiments .",
    "a modified version @xcite of the general purpose molecular dynamics code lammps @xcite was used to generate stiff elongated particles by gluing spheres together .",
    "long particles generated such way have parts with concave curvature and thus are prone to interlock if their structure is identical .",
    "therefore we prepared polydisperse samples by allowing the variation of the following quantities : the radius of the spheres by 10% , the length of the particles by 10% , and the overlap of the spheres between 30 - 70% of the radius .",
    "we also varied the number of spheres required to build up a long particle .",
    "the dynamics of 700 - 1200 elongated particles was modeled in simple couette flow , where the parallel walls were moved in the opposite directions as indicated in fig .",
    "[ numdemo ] by the arrows .",
    "the walls consisted of twice as large spheres as the average particle diameters . in the other two directions periodic boundary conditions were chosen .",
    "the particles were confined with constant pressure during shear .",
    "the generated shear rate was relatively uniform across the sample @xcite .",

    "the distribution of the alignment angles @xmath1 ( measured in the shear plane with respect to the local direction of the streamlines ) is presented for cylinders with length to diameter ratios of @xmath29 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and and rice with @xmath30 , @xmath5 , and @xmath9 in figs .",
    "[ dist](a)-(c ) and figs  [ dist](d)-(f ) , respectively .",
    "the first thing to note is the aspect ratio dependence of the distributions .",
    "the graphs show that increasing @xmath12 leads to a narrower distribution , i.e. a higher degree of shear induced ordering .",
    "the time and ensemble averaged particle orientation @xmath31 was determined by fitting the data by a gaussian ( with the constant offset subtracted ) , and is illustrated with a vertical ( blue / gray ) line in fig .",
    "[ dist](a)-(f ) .",
    "thus , asymptotically the average orientation encloses a small angle @xmath31 with the streamlines , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) for @xmath32 .",
    "the second interesting observation is that for cylinders ( @xmath33 and @xmath9 ) the distribution is broader than for ellipses with similar aspect ratio .",

    "this suggests that these grains align with their longest extension ( diagonal ) in the preferential direction .",
    "since we determine the particle orientation by measuring the orientation of the symmetry axis , the distribution of the detected angles has two peaks , approx .",
    "@xmath35 apart , which correspond to the two particle configurations illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dist1_4](b ) for @xmath36 .",
    "the effective average alignment angle in this case is between the angles corresponding to the two peaks , i.e. around @xmath37 .",
    "getting back to the case of longer cylinders , the above described effect could be one of the factors leading to a widening of the distributions ( especially for the case of cylinders with sharp edges ) compared to the case of rice with similar aspect ratio ( compare figs .",
    "[ dist](c ) and [ dist](f ) ) .",
    "figure  [ dist ] also illustrates the typical scatter of the angular distributions obtained by the two methods ( optical or x - ray measurements ) .",
    "data for all rice samples as well as for cylinders with @xmath38 were obtained by optical detection and the histograms presented were created using about 200,000 data points , while the data for pegs with @xmath29 and @xmath9 were collected from the surface region of the whole shear zone by x - ray ct ( about 10,000 data points ) . due to the smaller number of data points ,",
    "the scatter of the distributions is larger in these latter cases .    as explained before , the center @xmath31 of the orientational distribution was     of the particles with respect to the streamlines and ( b ) the order parameter @xmath21 as a function of the shear rate @xmath2 .",

    "[ theta - gamma ] , @xmath31 and @xmath21 ( as well as @xmath40 , not displayed ) are practically shear rate independent across more than three decades of @xmath2 .",
    "the slight decrease of @xmath21 observed for two samples of rice @xcite is not observed here for cylinders .",
    "the data points were collected using three different rotation rates ( @xmath41 0.26 , 0.52 and 4.2 rad / s ) of the bottom plate .",
    "the spatial variation of @xmath2 in the shear zone allows to span a relatively wide range of @xmath2 for each rotation rate , as marked in fig .",

    "the fact that the average orientation of the particles in the aligned state is shear rate independent is similar to the well studied _",
    "flow alignment _ of nematic liquid crystals .",
    "we have quantitatively compared our observations to the properties of nematics in @xcite , here we only wish to stress that the strong similarities with nematics indicate that the shear alignment is robust and is of geometrical origin . namely , even if the aspect ratios of the building blocks ( molecules and granulates ) are similar , there are other important differences between the two systems , e.g. , thermal fluctuations are important for molecules while they are negligible in the granular case . also ,",
    "the interparticle forces have very different character : the molecules experience attractive forces ( dipole - dipole , van der waals ) , while the granular particles investigated here interact only via hard core repulsion and friction .    as seen in fig .",
