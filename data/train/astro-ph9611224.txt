    "models for structure formation are based on the growth of small primordial density fluctuations by gravitational instability on a homogeneously expanding background universe . depending on the nature of the dark matter and",
    "whether the primordial fluctuations were adiabatic or isothermal , the first mass scale to collapse could be as small as one solar mass ( very heavy cold dark matter particles ) or as high as @xmath6 ( hot dark matter scenarios ) . in cdm cosmogonies",
    "the fluctuation spectrum at small wavelengths has only a logarithmic dependence for mass scales smaller than @xmath7 , which indicates that the small scale fluctuations in this model collapse nearly simultaneously in time .",
    "this leads to very complex dynamics during the formation of these structures , that can be studied accurately only by using realistic numerical computations to model the fluid motion and micro ",
    "physical processes as well as the dark matter component .",
    "we have recently been able to develop methods that allow us to study the problem in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "we describe this code briefly in section [ 3d ] but first review the process of formation during small scale structure collapse in the following section . a more extensive discussion of our results is given in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the cooling in small scale fluctuations is dominated by the rotational / vibrational modes of hydrogen molecules . in primordial gas at low temperatures ( @xmath8k ) molecular hydrogen can not be destroyed efficiently unless there is a radiation flux higher than @xmath9 in the lyman werner bands . once self - shielding is important , even higher",
    "fluxes would be needed .",
    "the dominating h@xmath10 producing gas phase reaction is the dissociative attachment reaction : @xmath11 in the absence of an external uv background one can integrate the rate equations to find the molecular hydrogen fraction formed during the collapse of primordial gas clouds with neutral hydrogen number density @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13 , and initial free electron fraction @xmath14 to be @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denote the rates for photo - attachment to and recombination of hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the production of h@xmath10 only depends logarithmically on time with a typical time scale of one initial recombination time .",
    "the temperature dependence is due to the ratio of recombination and formation time scales , which is a measure of the number of electrons available to produce . a typical fraction of @xmath18 is produced during the collapse of structures with virial temperatures greater than @xmath19 . for initial ( virial ) temperatures",
    "higher than @xmath20 the charge exchange with protons will efficiently destroy h@xmath10 , and will not be applicable .",
    "however , during the collapse of clouds with such high virial temperatures the final fraction will , nevertheless , be @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we achieve high spatial and mass resolution with the two  level hierarchical three  dimensional code ( hercules ) that we have developed for cosmology @xcite .",
    "this code is designed to simulate structure formation in an expanding dark matter dominated universe with newtonian gravity , multi  fluid hydrodynamics , radiative cooling , non  equilibrium chemistry and external radiation fields .",
    "furthermore , the code independently evolves the following nine species : neutral hydrogen @xmath22 , ionized hydrogen @xmath23 , negatively  charged hydrogen @xmath24 , hydrogen molecules @xmath25 , ionized hydrogen molecules @xmath26 , neutral helium @xmath27 , singly ",
    "ionized helium @xmath28 , doubly ",
    "ionized helium @xmath29 and free electrons @xmath30 .",
    "the 28 most important chemical rate equations ( including radiation processes ) are solved in non ",
    "equilibrium for the abundances of each of the nine species .",
    "the reaction rates and an extensive discussion of the chemistry model are provided in @xcite .",
    "we have also implemented a comprehensive model for the radiative cooling of the gas that includes atomic line excitation , recombination , collisional ionization , free  free transitions , molecular line excitations , and compton scattering of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) by electrons .",
    "we apply our code to high redshift pre  galactic structure formation and evolution , investigating specifically the collapse of the first high@xmath0 bound objects with total masses in the range @xmath31 .",
    "our model background spacetime is a flat ( @xmath32 ) cold dark matter dominated universe with hubble constant @xmath33 km  s@xmath34  mpc@xmath34 , baryonic fraction @xmath35 , and a hydrogen mass fraction of 76% .",
    "the baryonic matter is composed of hydrogen and helium in cosmic abundance with a hydrogen mass fraction of 76% and ratio of specific heats @xmath36 . the initial data for the baryonic and dark matter perturbations is the harrison  zeldovich power spectrum modulated with a cdm transfer function and normalized to the cluster scale @xmath37 .",
    "the data is initialized at redshift @xmath38 using bertschinger s",
    "@xcite constrained realization procedure to construct 3 and 4@xmath0 fluctuations in cubes of comoving length 1024kpc , 512kpc , and 128kpc , with total masses of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we reproduced the work of tegmark 1996 with the same cooling function @xcite we have used in our cosmological hydrodynamics code so that we can compare their findings directly to our 3d numerical results .",
    "( we note that tegmark used a modified form of the hollenbach and mckee ( 1979 ) cooling function . )",
    "figure 1a is analogous to fig .",
    "6 of tegmark 1996 but includes the mass evolution in our numerical results for the 4@xmath0 perturbations .",
    "the dotted lines are found by adding up the total mass @xmath42 found in cells with dark matter overdensities exceeding 200 .",
    "it is obvious that the use of a different cooling function has a very strong influence on the predicted mass that can collapse .",
    "although , the quantitative results are very different , the shape for these two different @xmath43 curves is rather similar at redshifts @xmath44 .",
    "the slopes are consistent with @xmath45 indicating a constant virial temperature since @xmath46 .",
    "a constant virial temperature in turn implies a roughly constant final fraction given by . for the case in tegmark ,",
    "the virial temperature in that regime is @xmath47 which yields @xmath48 which they argued to be roughly a constant universal value which , if exceeded , allows the cloud to collapse at its free fall rate . using the lepp and shull cooling function",
    "we find that the virial temperature needed to fulfill the tegmark requirement for collapse is @xmath49 for redshifts @xmath50 .",
    "this translates to a molecular fraction of only @xmath51 .",
    "our simulations , however , show that , although we used the lepp and shull cooling function , the fraction at the time when the baryons are collapsing into the dm potential wells is also about @xmath52 .",
    "hence , we find roughly the same critical fraction as derived by tegmark ( 1996 ) even with a very different cooling function .    in figure 1b we test against results from the @xmath53 ( open circles ) and the @xmath54 simulations .",
    "the fit is astonishingly good , although the initial temperature ( or redshift ) is somewhat difficult to pick out in this case since the heating due to adiabatic compression is slow and the initial ( virial ) temperature is not as well defined as in the case of collapse on larger mass scales .",
    "analyzing the time derivative of one finds for large times that @xmath55 which , for the spherical collapse model , translates to @xmath56 when we compare the slopes for different mass scales at the present time .",
    "this explains that the divergence of the two graphs in figure 1b for low redshifts is due to differences in collapse mass and redshift .",
    "it has been stressed by various authors that early small scale structure might influence the entire pregalactic medium and subsequently play an important role for structure formation on larger mass scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they are in principle capable of ionizing a large fraction of the pregalactic medium as well as to enrich it with metals .",
    "we hope to achieve the required dynamical range in future work to estimate the imf using adaptive mesh refinement techniques and so be able to quantify the feedback of collapsing small scale structure .",
    "we happily acknowledge discussions with m.j .",
    "rees and max tegmark .",
    "this work is done under the auspices of the grand challenge cosmology consortium ( gc3 ) and supported in part by nsf grant asc-9318185 .",
    "the simulations were performed on the cray - c90 at the psc , and the convex-3880 at the ncsa ."
