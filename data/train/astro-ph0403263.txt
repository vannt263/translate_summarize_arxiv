    "over 20 years have passed since @xcite first showed aluminum abundance variations on the red - giant branch ( rgb ) of the globular cluster ngc  6752 , and yet the nature of these inhomogeneities remains a mystery .",
    "observations since then continue to show aluminum ( and sodium and magnesium ) variations in other clusters ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "although variations in carbon and nitrogen were previously known , these could be described through a simple mixing mechanism proposed by @xcite , where rotationally induced meridional circulation currents could carry nuclearly processed materials such as c , n , and o from around the hydrogen - burning shell ( h shell ) of a red giant across the radiative zone to the outer convective envelope . heavier elements such as mg , na , and al were nt thought to be processed around the h shell , and any variations in them were taken as evidence that some kind of primordial pollution affected the surface abundances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". continued work on key nuclear reaction rates @xcite , however , suggested that these elements could be processed around the h shell under the same conditions that the cn and on nuclear cycles operated . using these results , as well as the widely accepted rates of @xcite , separate groups showed that it is possible to account qualitatively for the observed variations that showed na , al , and n anticorrelated with c , o , and , in some cases , mg @xcite .",
    "the challenge has always been describing the results _ quantitatively _ ; in particular , producing [ al / fe ] as high as 1.5 dex without overproducing [ na / fe ] , and depleting @xmath0 mg to the observed levels in m13 @xcite , all while remaining within the acceptable proton - capture rates @xcite . despite any latitude afforded by the reaction rate uncertainties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mixing theory still relies on non - solar abundance ratios in the star prior to mixing @xcite , thus , at least partly relying on primordial influences .",
    "theories other than meridional circulation have been put forth @xcite , but a detailed discussion of each is beyond the intent of this paper .",
    "regardless of the physics behind any mixing mechanism , the question still remains : are the al ( and na , mg ) variations caused by mixing , primordial sources , or a combination of both ? we might be able to answer this question by looking at another long outstanding problem in globular cluster astronomy , namely , the second - parameter effect . first pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the second - parameter effect refers to the phenomenon where the horizontal - branches ( hb ) of two clusters with similar metallicity ( the first parameter ) have markedly different color distributions .",
    "possible second parameters that have been investigated include age , initial helium abundance , cno abundance , and mass loss ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among others , but none is applicable to all clusters .",
    "one recent suggestion hypothesizes that if deep mixing ( i.e. , mixing that penetrates the h shell ) occurs , then helium will be brought to the surface affecting the hb morphology by making mixed stars both bluer and brighter ( sweigart 1997a , b ) .",
    "unfortunately , helium can not be measured in rgb stars because of their low surface temperatures , and helium settling on the hb precludes an accurate measurement in the hotter stars .",
    "however , models by @xcite , which use standard ( albeit , uncertain ) reaction rates , show that aluminum can be produced only in the h shell of giants within the last magnitude of the rgb , implying that an increase in helium in the envelope must also be accompanied by an increase in aluminum . from this",
    "we can postulate that , if [ al / fe ] variations are produced internally and not primordially , al could be a good surrogate to measure he mixing on the bright rgb , and if he mixing is indeed the second parameter , a relationship should exist between the ratio of al - strong to al - normal stars ( the al ratio ) and the ratio of blue to red hb stars ( the hb ratio ) .",
    "it is the _ distribution _ of abundances as a function of magnitude that is critical in determining the whether this correlation exists and what its cause might be .",
    "this current work attempts to provide some fresh data on clusters that have been historically under - studied . both m80",
    "( ngc  6093 ) and ngc  6752 possess blue hbs relative to other clusters at similar metallicity .",
    "for example , @xcite compared hubble @xmath1 m80 photometry directly with m13 and m3 , with the result that m80 s hb is very similar to m13 , while m3 lacked the extended blue tail of the other two clusters .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite presented extensive strmgren photometry of ngc  6752 , m13 , and m3 , showing extensive blue tails in the former two compared with the latter .",
    "neither m80 nor ngc  6752 had been studied extensively for abundances until @xcite and @xcite determined [ al / fe ] for 39 stars in ngc  6752 in total , extending the data of @xcite .",
    "these were significant results because they probed less evolved stars near the main - sequence turnoff , on the subgiant branch , and at the base of the rgb , which are below the point that mixing theories predict that aluminum can be produced . using a non - lte analysis , @xcite observed dwarfs with [ al / fe ] as low as @xmath2 dex from the al  i resonance lines , and subgiants with [ al / fe ] as high as @xmath3 dex from the doublet at @xmath48773/74   .",
    "in fact , the resonance line analysis for the dwarfs yielded [ al / fe ]  @xmath5  ( s.e.m . )  dex , while the subgiants gave [ al / fe ]  @xmath6  dex ( s.e.m . ) .",
    "the results for the dwarfs are uncertain due to the difficulty of analyzing resonance lines with non - lte corrections of as much as @xmath7  dex ; yet , the results are still surprisingly low . what causes the drastic change from the main sequence to the subgiant branch : atmospheric effects , the different choice of lines , or an actual physical phenomenon ?",
    "the @xcite results are more in line with the results of @xcite and with other clusters .",
    "we discuss implications of the aluminum data in ngc  6752 in more detail in section  [ sec : final_look ] .",
    "m80 , on the other hand , has no published abundances and is in need of further investigation , especially given its similarities to m13 in metallicity and hb morphology .",
    "the rest of the paper is outlined according to the following : we begin with a description of the observations in section  [ sec : obs ] , followed by our data reduction techniques in section  [ sec : ccd ] .",
    "we then discuss membership criteria in section  [ sec : rv ] . after culling the data",
    ", we show the results of our abundance analysis in section  [ sec : analysis ] and give our final conclusions in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "between 1999 and 2001 we used the ctio blanco 4 m telescope with the hydra multi - object spectrograph in the echelle mode to observe 105 stars near ngc  6752 and 47 stars near m80 . in the end , only a subset of these spectra were of sufficient quality to determine both cluster membership and abundance information .",
    "we describe the observations in the following two subsections , and discuss the radial velocity membership criteria in section  [ sec : rv ] .",
    "our observations were taken during two different epochs , between which the instrument underwent substantial changes .",
    "the first run was during the commissioning phase of hydra in 1999 , and only concentrated on ngc 6752 giants , while the second run occurred in 2001 , and involved both clusters .",
    "the different instrument parameters for each epoch are listed in table  [ tab : t01 ] .",
    "the net effect of the change between the two runs is the higher resolution offered in 2001 by placing slit plates in front of the large fibers and using the longer focal - length camera .",
    "the resolution was measured using the fwhm of narrow emission lines in the comparison lamps .",
    "both observing runs utilized the echelle grating .",
    "comprehensive membership surveys were available for neither m80 nor ngc 6752 when stars were selected for observation with hydra , limiting our ability to ensure that fibers were assigned to actual cluster members and not to field stars .",
    "both clusters are located at relatively low galactic latitude ( + 19 degrees for m80 and 25 degrees for ngc 6752 ) , and field star contamination is likely without proper motion or radial velocity information . for ngc 6752 , we used the @xmath8 photographic photometry of @xcite to select likely cluster members .",
    "this cluster has a large tidal radius of 55.34 @xcite , compared with the 40 field of view for hydra , ensuring that most stars in the aperture were likely to be members .",
    "since no wide - field photometry exists for m80 , we obtained @xmath8 ccd photometry of nine 13@xmath913 fields centered on m80 with the ctio 0.9 m telescope prior to our hydra run .",
    "the weather was not photometric , but we were able to obtain reasonable estimates of colors ( @xmath10 005 ) , and accurate astrometry after tying the system to the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "as a best guess for determining actual members of both clusters prior to our runs , we combined the existing photometry with the available proper motion data . for both clusters , we received accurate astrometric data from d. dinescu ( 1998 , 2001 , private communication ) , which also included proper motion information .",
    "the average proper motions for 998 ngc 6752 stars in the dinescu sample were @xmath11  =  @xmath12  ( @xmath13 )  mas  yr@xmath14 , and @xmath15  =  @xmath16  ( @xmath13 )  mas  yr@xmath14 , around the cluster center .",
    "we selected for observation only stars with @xmath17  mas  yr@xmath14 , and @xmath18  mas  yr@xmath14 for observing .",
    "dinescu s data for m80 were for stars in an annulus far outside the small cluster , and were less useful for selecting probable members .",
    "the final lists of stars that we ultimately determined to be cluster members and that had spectra with sufficient s / n to analyze reliably are given in tables  [ tab : t02 ] and [ tab : t03 ] .",
    "the star identification in the first column in table  [ tab : t02 ] , as well as the photometry for the ngc  6752 giants are from @xcite , while the alternate name in column 2 is from dinescu s work .",
    "the colors for ngc  6752 are corrected assuming e(@xmath19 ) = 0.04 , as listed by @xcite .",
    "the exposure times and s / n near 6700   are listed for each observing run separately . for m80 , the star number and photometry are our own , with e(@xmath20 magnitudes assumed @xcite . despite the rather large list of stars that we observed ,",
    "only 21 made it past the cutting room floor .",
    "the main obstacle to obtaining more spectra was the need for both high s / n and high resolution , which was aggravated by varying observing conditions and intermittent mechanical difficulties during the commissioning of hydra .",
    "the data from both epochs were processed in similar fashion using the reduction routines in iraf @xcite , beginning with the usual overscan and bias corrections .",
    "we made our flat - field image by combining several daytime sky flats that were exposed by using diffusing filter in place of the echelle filter , removing the spectral shape in the x and y directions by curve - fitting , and boxcar filtering the remainder , which left us with a smooth milky flat that contained only pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the data images were then divided by this flat .",
    "the object spectra were extracted using the iraf task apall with variance weighting , background subtraction , and cosmic - ray cleaning parameters turned on .",
    "the fiber - to - fiber response functions were calculated using the msresp1d task , where the individual fiber responses in an averaged quartz flat were determined with reference to an averaged twilight sky flat . to remove fiber - to - fiber variations as well as most of the instrument profile",
    ", these responses were then divided through the extracted spectra to create normalized spectra .    to determine the dispersion solutions for both epochs , we used etalon exposures bracketed around our object exposures throughout the night .",
    "these nighttime etalon spectra were calibrated with `` master '' etalon spectra that were acquired early during the first night of each run and were themselves calibrated from a thar lamp for the first epoch , and a henear lamp for the second epoch . the dispersion solution for a gas - filled lamp",
    "was applied to the extracted master etalon spectra , which were then averaged together to form one spectrum .",
    "the individual lines in the averaged master etalon spectrum were then measured and used to calibrate the individual spectra from the master etalon image so that every fiber used the same set of lines in its dispersion solution .",
    "these master etalon spectra were then used to calibrate the nighttime etalon spectra .",
    "we checked the quality of our etalon solutions by comparing ones taken on two different nights and found that both fiber - to - fiber and night - to - night dispersion solutions remained consistent to less than 0.002   .",
    "we prefer using the etalon because of its superior precision .",
    "for example , during the second epoch the henear exposure only contained 17 usable lines over @xmath21300  , with most lines on the red side of the spectrum , while the etalon contained 95 strong unblended lines uniformly spaced over the spectrum .",
    "the typical rms for the henear lamp was around 0.03  while the etalons were better by an order of magnitude .",
    "sky spectra were obtained by pointing @xmath2120 of the available fibers at empty fields during the program star exposures . after extraction and calibration , the skies were averaged together to build a clean single background spectrum , which was subtracted from the object spectra .",
    "finally , the program star spectra were flattened with a high order spline that was fitted through the continuum .",
    "no telluric line corrections were made since there were no telluric lines in our spectra during the second epoch and the ones appearing in the earlier data are outside our window of interest .",
    "after extracting and calibrating the spectra , we measured radial velocities in order to determine cluster membership . while the etalon lamps gave very high precision wavelength calibrations , they are uncertain in absolute wavelength .",
    "raw radial velocities were determined for each star using strong lines in our highest s / n ratio spectra .",
    "we calibrated the velocity scale for each cluster observation by setting the mode of the velocity distribution equal to the published radial velocity , using @xmath22  ( @xmath13 )  km s@xmath14 for m80 and @xmath23  ( @xmath13 )  km s@xmath14 for ngc 6752 @xcite .",
    "we accepted for further study all stars that that had radial velocities within 22 and 15  km s@xmath14 of the cluster means for m80 and ngc 6752 , respectively , and which have sufficient s / n ratio for reliable abundance determinations ( typically above 100 for epoch 1 and 60 for epoch 2 ) .",
    "we determined a set of lines to measure by examining the spectra with the highest s / n from each set of cluster giants .",
    "the lines were identified and compared with the solar spectrum of wallace , hinkle , & livingston ( 1993 ) , and with table  ii of @xcite , from which the oscillator strengths were chosen , with the following exceptions : the wavelengths and excitation potentials of the fe i lines come from @xcite , and we use the atomic data for the eu  ii line at @xmath246645   that is consistent with hyperfine splitting , as described in sec  [ sec : results ] .",
    "this produced an eu oscillator strength that is + 0.22  dex stronger than the value listed by @xcite and is @xmath25 dex stronger than the @xcite value .",
    "for the other lines , we used only those that @xcite cites as having an uncertainty in log @xmath26 of less than 0.05 dex , and stayed away from strong blends where the separate cores of each line could not be individually detected in our spectra .",
    "we measured equivalent widths using gaussian fits with the iraf routine splot and made use of the splot deblending algorithm for lines that overlapped , but appeared visually distinct .",
    "the line list and equivalent widths are given in table  [ tab : t04 ] for ngc  6752 , and table  [ tab : t05 ] for m80 .",
    "to check for consistency from epoch to epoch , we measured the equivalent widths of 12 lines in the spectra of seven ngc 6752 giants that were observed during both runs , and show the results in figure  [ fig : f01 ] , where the solid line represents perfect agreement .",
    "the average difference between the two datasets is @xmath27 m ( 1  @xmath28 ) , in the sense of the 2001 data minus the 1999 data . considering the different instrument capabilities between the two epochs and the different s / n quality of the datasets",
    ", we consider this to be good agreement .",
    "we explored two methods of determining model atmosphere parameters : spectroscopically from fe  i lines , and photometrically from @xmath8 colors .",
    "each method proved equally challenging , yet both provided consistent results .    to derive atmospheric models from fe  i lines , we employed the usual approach of removing dependencies of the derived abundances on both the excitation potentials and the reduced widths to derive @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we used moog @xcite , the lte analysis routine , in conjunction with marcs @xcite , the plane - parallel stellar atmosphere code , to determine all the abundances in this paper .",
    "the gravities were determined by interpolating between effective temperatures in a 12 gyr isochrone with [ fe / h]@xmath31 and @xmath32~=~+0.3 $ ] , provided to us by r. bell [ 1999 , private communication ; see houdashelt , bell , & sweigart ( 2000 ) ] .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is two - fold : first there are only a handful of fe  i lines available in the spectra , and usually only enough in the brightest ( and coolest ) stars to determine parameters .",
    "second , recent work has revealed possible problems with determining [ fe / h ] using fe  i lines due to nlte effects @xcite , which are most exaggerated at lower metallicities and for low excitation - potential lines .",
    "the @xcite results , however , are from main - sequence turn - off stars and it appears from their work and from @xcite that the `` overionization '' problem that might cause difficulties in less evolved stars probably is nt a concern here .",
    "we also derived @xmath29 photometrically with the color - corrected @xmath8 data from @xcite for ngc 6752 , using the bell isochrone discussed above , which provides transformed colors in @xmath33 and @xmath34 . from this @xmath29",
    "we determined an appropriate log  @xmath35 from the isochrone , and then found @xmath30 via the empirical formula given by @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath30  @xmath36  km s@xmath14 .",
    "this approach provides microturbulent velocities that are , on a star - by - star basis , systematically higher by @xmath37@xmath13  km s@xmath14 than those determined via fe  i lines .",
    "as discussed below , this has little effect on the final results .",
    "comparing @xmath29 from the spectroscopy with @xmath29 from the photometry for 11 ngc 6752 giants that had spectra with s / n@xmath38 and at least 11 fe  i lines over a range of excitation potential from 1.0 ev to 4.8 ev , we found an average difference of @xmath39  ( @xmath13 )  k , with the spectroscopic determination yielding the lower values on average .",
    "removing the most discrepant case , star 277 , reduces @xmath29@xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath29@xmath42 to @xmath43  ( @xmath13 )  k. the agreement is quite good given the uncertainties in the photometry and small number of fe  i lines , indicating that either approach is sufficient for determining model atmosphere parameters .",
    "a similar analysis for the m80 giants shows the spectroscopic temperatures to be @xmath44  ( @xmath13 )  k lower on average than the photometric determinations .",
    "the brightest giant studied in ngc 6752 , star 3589 in the buonanno photometry , also has a color that is both too red for our isochrone at its magnitude , and inconsistent with the next brightest giant , star 2403 , which is only 0.1 magnitudes below it on the rgb ; however , @xmath29 determined from the spectrum of star 3589 is only 25  k cooler than star 2403 , indicating that its color is either in error , and it most likely belongs on the bright rgb , or that it is a variable star .",
    "the model atmosphere parameters for our giants are listed in table  [ tab : t06 ] for both clusters , with the method chosen for deriving the parameters indicated in column 5 .",
    "where possible , we used the photometrically derived parameters , but occasionally had to rely on the spectroscopic models when the photometry appeared questionable .",
    "this preference allowed us to utilize spectra that had lower s / n ratios than would be required to derive @xmath29 and @xmath30 spectroscopically . because of the lower resolution of the first epoch data , we still , nonetheless , needed high s / n ( @xmath45 ) to derive abundances , while a factor of two lower s / n was sufficient for the second - epoch data .",
    "finally , we examine the sensitivity of our abundances on our choice of model atmosphere parameters , as shown in table  [ tab : t07 ] .",
    "the top row shows a reasonable estimate for the uncertainties in @xmath29 , while giving even wider latitude in @xmath46log  @xmath35 and @xmath46@xmath30 .",
    "the variations are determined using the model and data from star 2240 in ngc  6752 , which has a @xmath29 that is near the median value for our sample .",
    "since the sensitivity to the parameters is not symmetric , we report in the table the worse result of either increasing or decreasing a given parameter .",
    "only the 2001 data are used in this test since the spectrum has both a full complement of lines and a high s / n .",
    "the results are not surprising : @xmath29 plays the biggest role in the error budget , with the low e.  p. lines of ti  i and cr  i being the most sensitive , while the ionized lines are little affected . except for ti  ii and eu  ii ,",
    "an increase in @xmath29 leads to an increase in [ abundance / h ] .",
    "uncertainties in log  @xmath35 lead to only small errors for even the pressure - sensitive ions with some elements increasing with log  @xmath35 ( al , ca , ti  i , and cr ) and others decreasing ( ti  ii , fe , ni , la , and eu ) . finally , uncertainties due to @xmath30 are quite small , which is consistent with the many weak lines employed in our analysis . increasing @xmath30 desaturates the line thereby increasing the derived abundance , which is what we find in our results , with [ al / fe ] having zero dependence within the @xmath30 uncertainties",
    "of course , the three parameters are not uncorrelated , so variations in one necessarily lead to variations in the others ( as can be seen by the formula for @xmath30 , which is a function of @xmath29 ) and the sensitivities reported in table  [ tab : t07 ] can be be modified to reflect this in the total uncertainty due to the atmospheric models . since the focus of this study is primarily on aluminum , we note that the model uncertainties introduce only @xmath21  0.1 dex uncertainty in the [ al / fe ] ratio .      in table",
    "[ tab : t08 ] we present the abundances of 11 stars in ngc  6752 and 10 in m80 .",
    "these were accepted as cluster members after determining that their derived [ fe / h ] ratios were consistent with the anticipated metallicities of each cluster , around @xmath47  dex .",
    "we estimate that the abundances are uncertain by about 0.15 dex after accounting for line - to - line scatter , uncertainties in oscillator strengths and atmospheric parameters , and instrumental errors .",
    "the abundances for the ngc  6752 data are averaged together when available by giving the second - epoch results twice the weight of the first to account for the factor of two improvement in resolution . with the exception of star 3589",

    "of course , m80 was observed during only the second epoch and the results were derived with the models listed in table  [ tab : t06 ] .",
    "the iron abundances assume a solar value of log  @xmath48 , and the rest of the abundances are on the @xcite scale .",

    "3011 and m80    5 , for which we fit synthetic spectra as required by the very weak lines .",
    "all other abundances were determined via the equivalent width force - fitting routine in moog .    for lines that are indistinguishable from noise",
    ", we include estimates for upper limits to [ al / fe ] for several stars in table  [ tab : t08 ] .",

    "this approach alleviates the challenge of trying to decide when a fit of a perfect synthetic spectrum to a real , noisy spectrum is actually measuring data or measuring noise .",

    "the results appear to indicate that the data might be a marginal detection of a weak al  i feature at @xmath526696 ; however , we choose to err on the side of caution and consider this an upper limit .",
    "the motive for deriving upper limits is to determine whether or not these stars might still be al rich or whether they actually are al normal and the al lines are undetectable because of temperature , s / n ratio , or resolution .",

    "this number is consistent with the results of @xcite for m5 , where the mean [ eu / la ] is @xmath57 .",
    "we do note that a straightforward comparison of lanthanum and europium abundances with the work of other authors is inhibited by the fact that different authors use different atomic data , particularly when correcting for hfs effects , where the data are scarce and change frequently .",
    "still , the mean [ eu / fe ] for m80 is higher than seen in m13 , which has @xmath58>~=~+0.44~{\\pm}~0.11 $ ]  ( @xmath13 ) @xcite , or in either ngc  288 or ngc  362 , which are enhanced by @xmath210.55 dex @xcite . in both papers",
    "the authors use a log @xmath26 of @xmath59 , which if put on our scale would cause their abundances to decrease by 0.22 dex , making the discrepancy even larger .",
    "finally , we note via the @xmath526707   li  i feature that no cluster stars showed evidence for having enhanced lithium , as observed by @xcite in m3 , and is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "* we observed 21 giants in the globular clusters m80 and ngc  6752 with spectra of sufficient quality to determine abundances . * both m80 and ngc 6752 display a spread of aluminum abundances , having mean abundances of @xmath60  dex and @xmath25  dex , respectively .",
    "the abundance spreads are 0.43 ( @xmath13 ) dex for m80 and 0.36 ( @xmath13 ) dex for ngc  6752 .",
    "* the aluminum data can not resolve the discrepancy in the [ al / fe ] values near the main - sequence turnoff and the subgiants as observed by @xcite . *",
    "no trends between [ al / fe ] ratios and magnitude are discernible in our small sample . *",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] value for m80 is @xmath61 , which is the first spectroscopic determination for this cluster . for ngc  6752 ,",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] is @xmath62 , which is consistent with previous results . *",
    "the fe - peak elements chromium and nickel follow iron closely . *",
    "the [ ca / fe ] enhancements are consistent with the @xmath54-enhancements observed in other clusters . *",
    "the [ eu / la ] ratio is constant for both clusters at @xmath56 dex , which does not appear unusual ; however , both [ eu / fe ] and [ la / fe ] are enhanced in m80 relative to ngc  6752 .",
    "now that we ve derived aluminum abundances in m80 and ngc  6752 , are we any closer to answering whether or not the variations are the result of primordial pollution , mixing processes , or both ?",
    "perhaps when combined with the results of @xcite we can get some insight into just how complicated this problem really is ( we do not include the gratton data here since they were biased by use of the @xmath53 index to select stars . )",
    "given the differences in the quality of the data between the two studies , and the still small number of stars that have been analyzed , it is difficult to draw firm conclusions .",
    "if mixing is an ongoing phenomenon , then one would expect that the al ratio would increase with decreasing magnitude , as it appears to in m13 @xcite ; unfortunately , the small numbers make this difficult to discern at this point .",
    "an interesting result also comes from both @xcite and @xcite , who show that stars on the subgiant / lower red giant branch may have just as much al in them as stars on the upper rgb , where mixing is theoretically possible .",
    "these results might suggest that all al anomalies are the result of pollution , but this raises yet another question : can it be demonstrated that a globular cluster main sequence star , subgiant , or lower red giant exists that has strongly enhanced al and is not depleted in c and/or o ? that is ,",
    "if the cno variations are the result of deep mixing and the al ( and na ) anomalies are primordial , there should be stars that show uncorrelated abundance patterns .",
    "but , if the cno and na - al anomalies are both caused by primordial scenarios , then why does evidence exist , in clusters where it s been studied , that the total c@xmath63n@xmath63o remains constant from star to star independent of the na or al content @xcite , and how does one explain @xmath64c ratios near the cn cycle equilibrium value in many other clusters @xcite ? on the other hand , if the anomalies are all created _ in - situ _ , what is the physics behind them that can occur without completely contradicting well - established basic theories of stellar evolution ? it used to be that one could side with one scenario or the other ,",
    "then the data became more complicated , and one would say that it was somehow a mixture of both primordial and evolutionary scenarios . maybe in the end that will be the final conclusion , but we are far from proving it ; too many questions remain to be answered and too many observations remain to be made .",
    "we thank d. dinescu for providing us with valuable proper motion data , p. palunas for aiding us with coordinate system transformations , and s. keller for helping us with our photometry .",
