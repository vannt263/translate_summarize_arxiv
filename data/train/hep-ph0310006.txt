    "three - family structure of fermions is one of the most puzzling features of the standard model .",
    "the other puzzles comes from the baryonic asymmetry of the universe and from astrophysical observations of the dark matter , whose particles are most probably beyond the standard model . here",
    "we make an attempt to connect these three phenomena in the framework of the @xmath0 scheme with four families of fermions .",
    "we discuss why the classification scheme based on the @xmath0 groups is preferrable and how it leads to the non - baryonic dark matter in the universe if the universe is baryonic asymmetric .",
    "breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry between four generations to its @xmath14 subgroup separates the fermions of the fourth generation from the fermions of the other three families .",
    "if the charge @xmath6  the generator of the @xmath15 group  is conserved in the process of baryogenesis , as it occurs for example in electroweak baryogenesis , the formation of the baryon asymmetry automatically leads to formation of dark matter made of the massive fourth - generation neutrinos . in such scenario",
    "the mass density of the dark matter in the universe essentially exceeds the mass density of the baryonic matter .",
    "in the current standard model three families ( generations ) of fermions have identical properties above the electroweak energy scale .",
    "each family contains 16 weyl fermions ( 8 left and 8 right ) which transform under the gauge group @xmath16 of weak , hypercharge and strong interactions respectively .",
    "in addition they are characterized by two global charges : baryonic number @xmath17 and leptonic number @xmath18 .",
    "the grand unification theories ( gut ) unify weak , hypercharge and strong interactions into one big symmetry group , such as @xmath19 , with a single coupling constant .",
    "there is , however , another group , the minimal subgroup of @xmath19 , which also elegantly unites 16 fermions in each generation , a type of pati  salam model @xcite with the symmetry group @xmath20 .",
    "this left - right symmetric group preserves all the important properties of @xmath19 , but it has advantages when compared to the @xmath19 group @xcite . in particular , the electric charge is left ",
    "right symmetric : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the difference between baryon and lepton numbers ( the generator of @xmath23 color group ) , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are left and right isotopic spins ( generators of the groups @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "also the @xmath28 group nicely fits the classification scheme of quantum vacua based on the momentum - space topology of fermionic propagators @xcite .     as bound states of @xmath29-fermions and @xmath30-bosons .",
    "numbers show the electric charge . ]    according to terazawa @xcite the 16 fermions of each generation can be represented as the product @xmath31 of 4 bosons and 4 fermions in fig .",
    "[ firstfamilyfig ] .",
    "the terazawa scheme is similar to the slave - boson approach in condensed matter , where the spinons are fermions which carry spin and holons are bosons which carry electric charge @xcite . here",
    "the `` holons '' @xmath30 form the color @xmath23 quartet of spin-0 @xmath32-singlet particles with @xmath33 charges of the @xmath23 group and electric charges @xmath34 .",
    "the `` spinons '' are spin-@xmath35 particles @xmath29 , which are color @xmath23 singlets and @xmath32-isodoublets .",
    "as bound states of @xmath29-fermions and @xmath30- and @xmath6-bosons . ]",
    "what is missing in this scheme is fermionic families .",
    "the natural extension , which also uses the @xmath0 symmetry , is to introduce the group @xmath2 in the family direction ( fig .",
    "[ familiesfig ] ) .",
    "this requires the introduction of additional 4-th generation of fermions .",
    "then the family charge @xmath6 comes as one of the generators of @xmath2 in the same way as the @xmath33 charge comes as one of the generators of @xmath23 color group : @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is assigned to ordinary matter in three generations , while @xmath5 corresponds to the fourth generation .",
    "the total number 64 of weyl fermions , each being described by 2 complex or 4 real functions , satisifies the @xmath38 rule , which probably reflects the importance of the clifford algebra in the undelying physics @xcite .",
    "this is another advantage of classification based on @xmath32 and @xmath0 groups .",
    "this extension also fits the terazawa scheme which is modified by addition of extra boson .",
    "all 64 fermions are now represented as the product @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ familiesfig ] , where @xmath6 is the quartet of bosons with @xmath6 charges of the @xmath2 .",
    "let us assume that the breaking of @xmath2 symmetry occurred in the same way as the breaking of the color group : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the group generated by charge @xmath6 .",
    "then all the charges of the fourth - generation fermions are the same as that of the ordinary - matter fermions in first three generations except for the family charge @xmath6 .",
    "this separates out the 4-th generation in the same manner as leptons  the fourth color ",
    "are separated from quarks .",
    "the 4-th generation fermions can not mix with ordinary fermions in the first three generations in the same manner as leptons can not mix with quarks .",
    "this is the main difference from the democratic scheme of sequential generations , which assumes that all generations are equal .",
    "the important consequence of such a discrimination between the generations is that the excess of the baryonic charge in the universe must be accompanied by the uncompensated neutrinos of the 4-th generation .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath6 charge is strictly conserved .",
    "this certainly occurs in the process of electroweak baryogenesis , in which the baryons and leptons are created due to the anomalous non - conservation of the baryonic and leptonic numbers , while the chiral anomaly conserves the charges @xmath6 and @xmath33 ( this does not depend on whether @xmath2 is a local or global group ) .",
    "the conservation of these two charges gives @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are ( algebraic ) densities of quarks and leptons belonging to the ordinary matter in three generations ; and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are that of the fourth generation . from eqs.([fcharge ] ) one obtains the densities of the fourth - generation quarks and leptons in terms of the ordinary matter ( which mainly belongs to the first generation ) : @xmath48 if in our universe @xmath49 , i.e. the leptonic charge of electrons is compensated by that of antineutrinos , one obtains @xmath50 where @xmath7 is the algebraic number density of baryons in our universe .",
    "this means that any excess of the baryonic charge in the universe is accompanied by the excess @xmath51 of the neutrinos over antineutrinos in the fourth generation ( we assume that the mass of the 4-th generation neutrino is smaller than that of the 4-th generation electron , @xmath52 ) .",
    "if this is correct , the 4-th generation neutrinos adds to the mass of our universe and may play the role of the dark matter .",
    "the mass @xmath11 of the 4-th generation ( dark ) neutrino can be expressed in terms of the mass of baryon ( nucleon ) @xmath53 and the energies stored in the baryonic matter ( with fraction @xmath54 of the total mass in the flat universe ) and non - baryonic dark matter ( with fraction @xmath55 ) : @xmath56    masses of the 4-th generation of fermions must be below the electroweak energy scale , since the masses of all the fermions ( ordinary and of 4-th generation ) are formed due to violation of the electroweak symmetry , as follows from the topological criterion of mass protection ( see chapter 12 of ref .",
    "there is also the lower constraint on the 4-th neutrino mass which comes from the measured decay properties of the @xmath12-boson : @xmath57 gev ( see e.g. @xcite and somewhat stronger constraint @xmath58 gev from the @xmath12-resonance lineshape in @xcite ) .",
    "then the fourth generation contribution to the dark matter must be @xmath59 since in our spatially flat universe @xmath60 , this gives the constraint on the baryonic mass in the universe : @xmath61 . on the other hand , since the baryonic density in the luminous matter is @xmath62 , the constraint on the dark matter mass is @xmath63 .",
    "there are , however , the other constraints on the mass of @xmath64 of heavy neutrino obtained from particle and astroparticle implications of the 4-th generation neutrinos @xcite , from which it follows that @xmath64 must be larger than 200 gev . for the early limits on heavy neutrino contribution to the density of dark matter , which follow from consideration of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation ,",
    "see refs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the electroweak data fit prefers the 50 gev neutrinos @xcite , though the masses as high as 200 gev are not excluded .",
    "one must also take into account that the dark matter contribution @xmath55 is only a fraction of unity , as follows from observational data on cmb angular temperature fluctuations @xcite",
    ". on the other hand the baryonic content of dark matter is about 10 times bigger than the baryon density in the visible matter , as follows independently both from the structure of acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuations @xcite and from the primordial nucleosynthesis theory plus observed abundance of light elements ( @xmath65he , d , @xmath66he and @xmath67li ) @xcite . as a result",
    "one finds that @xmath68 .",
    "together with the constraint on @xmath64 this indicates that the excess @xmath69 of neutrinos over antineutrinos must be smaller ( maybe by one or two orders of magnitude ) than @xmath7 .",
    "this would mean that the @xmath6-charge is not strictly conserved .",
    "it appears that the classification scheme based on the @xmath32 and @xmath0 groups has many interesting features .",
    "here we considered one of them  the discrimination between the ordinary - matter fermions and the fourth generation .",
    "if the family charge @xmath6 is strictly conserved , the fermions of the fourth - generation neutrinos with density @xmath70 must be necessarily present in the baryonic asymmetric universe to compensate the family charge . moreover , it is not excluded that it is the asymmetry in the fourth - generation neutrinos which is primary and it serves as a source of the baryonic asymmetry of the universe .",
    "these massive neutrinos form the stable dark matter with mass density exceeding the baryonic mass density by the ratio of masses of neutrino and baryon @xmath71 . according to the well known physics of the decay of @xmath12-boson",
    ", this factor must be larger than 50 . whether this is an acceptable solution to the dark matter problem depends on details of the @xmath72 model .",
    "the above relation between the baryonic and non - baryonic masses of the universe is based on the assumption of the conservation of the @xmath6-charge .",
    "if this requirement is weakened , the dark matter density coming from the fourth generation of fermions will depend on the details of the baryo- or neutrino - genesis and on the further cosmological evolution of ordinary and dark matter .",
