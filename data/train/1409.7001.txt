    "discontinuous absorbing phase transitions in low dimensions have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "much of this effort has been based on the fundamental problem of determining the necessary ingredients for their occurrence .",
    "generically , discontinuous transitions require an effective mechanism that suppresses the formation of absorbing minority islands ( within the active phase ) induced by fluctuations .",
    "although they may occur in larger dimensions , there are strong evidences that in one dimension short range interactions can not stabilize compact clusters @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a long - range counterpart of the contact process ( cp ) , named @xmath4cp @xcite , has revealed such occurrence , even in one dimension . in the @xmath4cp ,",
    "particles are created and annihilated like in the usual short - range cp @xcite , but the creation rate depends on the length @xmath1 of the island of inactive sites according to the expression @xmath5 . for small @xmath0",
    "the interactions are effectively long - range leading to a discontinuous transition @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the long - range interaction introduces a collective behavior that is able to suppress the formation of minority islands .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath0 is large the phase transition becomes continuous and belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class , in similarity with the usual cp .",
    "hence there exists a tricritical point @xmath6 where the transition changes from discontinuous to continuous .",
    "it is known that the presence of certain dynamics , such as disorder and diffusion , may drastically change the critical behavior and the classification of the phase transition . as in the equilibrium case",
    ", disorder may induce distinct universality classes and griffiths phases @xcite .",
    "particle diffusion , on the other hand , can also be responsible for substantial changes , including not only the emergence of distinct universality classes @xcite but also the appearance of novel structures in the phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "however , much of the effort on understanding the role of these ingredients has focused on continuous transitions , with the situation for discontinuous transitions being much less understood @xcite .    in order to shed some light in this direction",
    ", we analyze the role of diffusion in the @xmath0-cp model , which is perhaps the simplest one - dimensional system presenting a discontinuous absorbing transition .",
    "this has been accomplished using numerical simulations performed in both the constant rate ( ordinary ) @xcite and the constant particle number ( conserved ) ensembles @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed for several values of the diffusion rate and several values of @xmath0 . we have found that the tricritical point @xmath6 ( which signals the crossover from continuous to discontinuous transition ) decreases as the diffusion increases .",
    "this leads to three distinct scenarios . for sufficiently small and large values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the diffusion does not change the phase transition , remaining always discontinuous and continuous , respectively . on the other hand , in an intermediate range of @xmath0 s ,",
    "the diffusion causes a suppression of the phase coexistence leading to a continuous transition belonging to the dp universality class .",
    "the problem is also studied using mean - field theory in the pair approximation . as we show , however , mean - field calculations do not agree with the numerical results : they predict that @xmath6 should increase with @xmath7 and not the inverse .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are discussed .",

    "the one dimensional diffusive @xmath4cp @xcite is defined as follows .",
    "to each site @xmath8 of a one - dimensional lattice we associate an occupation variable @xmath9 that takes the values 0 or 1 according to whether the site is empty or occupied .",
    "the dynamics involves three processes : spontaneous annihilation of a single particle ( schematically represented by @xmath10 ) , catalytic creation of a particle ( @xmath11 ) and particle hopings to a nearest - neighbor empty site ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) .",
    "the transition rate @xmath14 is given by the following expression : @xmath15 where @xmath7 and @xmath16 are the diffusion and annihilation rates , respectively and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the diffusion , annihilation and creation processes respectively .",

    "when @xmath23 one recovers the original short - range cp @xcite . as in that case",
    ", single particles are created only in empty sites surrounded by at least one particle . however , in the @xmath4cp the creation rate depends on the length @xmath1 between the particles surrounding the empty chosen site .    for large values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the system is constrained into the absorbing state , in which no particles are allowed to be created .",
    "decreasing the parameter @xmath16 , a phase transition to an active state takes place , whose location and classification depends on the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 . in order to compare with previous results @xcite ,",
    "we take the value @xmath24 . in this case , when @xmath25 the crossover regime occurs at @xmath26 ; i.e. , the transition is continuous for @xmath27 ( belonging to the dp universality class ) and discontinuous for @xmath28 .",

    "hence , our results reveal a novel role played by the diffusion in phase transitions , being responsible for weakening the compact displacement among the particles .",
    "notwithstanding , we emphasize that further studies of discontinuous absorbing transitions in the presence of diffusion are necessary in order to yield a complete picture of the problem .    finally , we turn to the marked disagreement between the mean - field results and the numerical simulations , regarding the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 . as we have seen , in the mean - field approximation @xmath6 was found to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 , whereas in the numerical simulations the exact opposite behavior was observed .",
    "moreover , in the mean - field we have found that above @xmath132 the transition should be discontinuous for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to the correlations neglected by the mean - field theory , that become more important in low dimensions ( as in the present case ) . in fact a similar disagreement between mean - field and numerical simulations in an one - dimensional discontinuous transition has been recently investigated in ref .",
    "another possibility concerns the restrictions of the lattice particle occupations ( only one particle can occupy a given site ) that , together with the present lattice topology , could prevent the particle clustering induced by increasing the diffusion . in other words , a lattice model allowing multiple occupation of each site may lead to results compatible with mean - field predictions .",
