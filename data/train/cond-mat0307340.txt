    "in this article we describe an apparatus designed for the continuous - frequency measurement of low temperature electromagnetic absorption spectra in the microwave range . the motivation to develop this instrument comes from a desire to resolve , in great detail , the microwave conductivity of high - quality single crystals of high - t@xmath3 cuprate superconductors . however",
    ", the technique we describe should find a wealth of applications to other condensed matter systems , providing a means to explore the dynamics of novel electronic states with unprecedented resolution .",
    "the possibilities include : the physics of the metal  insulator transition , where charge localization should lead to frequency scaling of the conductivity ; electron spin resonance spectroscopy of crystal field excitations ; ferromagnetic resonance in novel magnetic structures ; and cyclotron resonance studies of fermi surface topology .",
    "in addition to the cuprate superconductors , other natural possibilities in the area of superconductivity include heavy fermion and ruthenate materials , as well as high resolution spectroscopy of low - frequency collective excitations such as josephson plasmons and order - parameter collective modes .",
    "early microwave measurements on high quality single crystals of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 showed that cooling through t@xmath7  k decreased the surface resistance very rapidly , by four orders of magnitude at 2.95  ghz , reaching a low temperature value of several @xmath1.@xcite resolving this low absorption in the microwave region has provided a technical challenge that has been successfully met over most of the temperature range below t@xmath3 by the use of high precision cavity - perturbation techniques.@xcite in these experiments , the sample under test is brought into the microwave fields of a high quality - factor resonant structure made from superconducting cavities or low - loss dielectric pucks .",
    "a limitation of such techniques is that the resonator is generally restricted to operation at a single fixed frequency , therefore requiring the use of many separate experiments in order to reveal a spectrum .",
    "furthermore , a very general limitation of the cavity perturbation method is that the dissipation of the unknown sample must exceed the dissipation of the cavity itself in order to be measured with high precision  a very strong demand for a high quality superconductor in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "the measurement of the residual absorption in superconductors is challenging at any frequency : in the case of infra - red spectroscopy the problem becomes that of measuring values of reflectance that are very close to unity .",
    "the challenge lies in the calibration of the measurement , and in both microwave and infra - red work , one relies on having a reference sample of known absorption to calibrate the loss in the walls of the microwave resonator or the infra - red reflectance . despite these limitations , resonant microwave techniques are the only methods with sufficient sensitivity to measure the evolution of the microwave absorption over a wide temperature range . in a recent effort by our group ,",
    "five superconducting resonators were used to map a coarse conductivity spectrum from 1  ghz to 75  ghz in exceptionally clean samples of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath9 from 4  k to 100  k.@xcite this work revealed low temperature quasiparticle dynamics inconsistent with simple models of @xmath10-wave superconductivity , whose key signatures appear in the frequency dependence of the conductivity.@xcite the failure of simple theories to give a complete description of the temperature evolution and shape of the conductivity spectra in the best quality samples has driven us to develop the technique described here , with the result that we can now resolve low - temperature microwave conductivity spectra in unprecedented detail .",
    "bolometric detection is a natural method for measuring the surface resistance spectrum over a continuous frequency range . for any conductor ,",
    "the power absorption in a microwave magnetic field is directly proportional to the surface resistance @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the r.m.s .",
    "magnitude of the tangential magnetic field at the surface @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", a measurement of the temperature rise experienced by a weakly - thermally - anchored sample exposed to a known microwave magnetic field @xmath13 directly gives @xmath11 . to enhance rejection of spurious temperature variations ,",
    "the rf power should be amplitude modulated at low frequency and the resulting temperature oscillations of the sample detected synchronously .",
    "we note that as part of a pioneering study of superconducting al , a similar bolometric microwave technique was used by biondi and garfunkel to examine the detailed temperature dependence of the superconducting gap frequency.@xcite this earlier experiment had the simplifying advantage of measuring the absorption by a large waveguide made entirely from single crystalline al .",
    "unfortunately , in more complicated materials such as the multi - elemental cuprate superconductors , the best quality samples can only be produced as small single crystals .",
    "more recently , frequency - scanned bolometric measurements have proven useful in probing collective excitations in small samples of high - t@xmath3 cuprates at frequencies above 20  ghz where the absorption is larger and much easier to measure.@xcite these techniques , however , have not focussed on the challenge of resolving the low temperature absorption of high - quality single crystals across a broad frequency range .",
    "a characteristic feature of many electronic materials of current interest is reduced dimensionality , which gives rise to highly anisotropic transport coefficients . when making microwave measurements , a well - defined geometry must be chosen in order to separate the individual components of the conductivity tensor , and also to ensure that demagnetization effects do not obscure the measurement .",
    "one particularly clean approach that has been widely used places the sample to be characterized near a position of high symmetry in a microwave enclosure , in the quasi - homogeneous microwave magnetic field near an electric node . often , single crystal samples grow naturally as platelets having a broad @xmath15@xmath16 plane crystal face and thin @xmath17-axis dimension , and demagnetization effects are minimized if the broad face of the sample is aligned parallel to the field . in response to the applied rf magnetic field ,",
    "screening currents flow near the surface of the sample along the broad @xmath15 or @xmath16 face and must necessarily flow along the @xmath17 direction to complete a closed path .",
    "in some cases , it is desirable to work with samples that are very thin , rendering the @xmath17-axis contribution negligible .",
    "alternatively , by varying the aspect ratio of the sample by either cleaving or polishing , one can make a series of measurements to disentangle the different crystallographic contributions , without having to change samples .",
    "for example , in the cuprate superconductors , the conductivity parallel to the two dimensional cuo@xmath4 plane layers can be several orders of magnitude larger than that perpendicular to the weakly - coupled planes .",
    "typical as - grown crystal dimensions are @xmath18  mm@xmath19 . for this aspect ratio , experiments where a sample was cleaved into many pieces showed that the @xmath17-axis contribution is unimportant.@xcite we note here that all measurements presented in this article employ the low - demagnetization sample orientation discussed above .",
    "the broadband surface - resistance measurement technique we describe in the following sections provides three distinct technical advances over previous bolometric approaches : a uniform microwave field configuration in the sample region that permits the separation of anisotropic conductivity components ; the use of an _ in - situ _ reference sample that calibrates the microwave field strength at the sample absolutely ; and very high sensitivity afforded by the choice of a resistive bolometer optimized for the low - temperature range and mounted on a miniaturized thermal stage .",
    "these features of our apparatus permit precision measurements of the absolute value of @xmath20 in very - low - loss samples down to 1.2  k and over the frequency range 0.1 - 21  ghz .",
    "we will briefly demonstrate that this range captures the key frequency window for long - lived nodal quasiparticles in extremely clean samples of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 , and to further demonstrate the performance and versatility of the apparatus , we also show an example of zero - field electron - spin - resonance spectroscopy .     a simple thermal model consisting of a heat capacity @xmath21 thermally isolated from base temperature @xmath22 by a weak thermal link of conductance @xmath23 .",
    "the resistive bolometer is thermally anchored to @xmath21 and monitors its temperature , @xmath24 , which is elevated above @xmath22 by a constant current bias @xmath25 passing through the bolometer .",
    "the absorption of incident signal power @xmath26 causes heating in @xmath21 , detectable as a temperature rise through a change in the voltage @xmath27.,width=153 ]",
    "it is instructive to calculate the minimum power detectable by a simple thermal stage , the temperature of which is monitored by a resistive bolometer , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model].@xcite the bolometer has a resistance @xmath28 and is in thermal equilibrium with a larger heat capacity @xmath21 representing contributions from the sample , its holder , and the weak thermal link .",
    "this combination is weakly connected , via a thermal conductance @xmath23 , to a heat sink maintained at base temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the bolometer is heated to its operating temperature @xmath24 by a bias power @xmath29 , where @xmath25 is the fixed bolometer bias current . for this analysis",
    "we do not consider feedback effects , although they are very important in the special case of transition edge bolometers.@xcite as a result , we consider a configuration where @xmath25 provides only modest self - heating of the bolometer , such that @xmath30 .",
    "an incident signal power @xmath31 raises the temperature by an amount @xmath32 , causing a change in the readout voltage across the bolometer @xmath33 .",
    "we then define a threshold detectable signal level that is equal to the thermal noise @xmath34 generated in a bandwidth @xmath35 in the bolometer , @xmath36 .",
    "it is then possible to write an expression for the minimum detectable power @xmath37 in terms of the dimensionless sensitivity of the bolometer @xmath38 , typically of the order of unity , the noise power @xmath39 , and the bolometer bias power @xmath40 : @xmath41 from this expression one immediately sees that it is desirable to minimize both the bias and noise powers , within the combined constraints of maintaining the bolometer temperature at @xmath24 and keeping the thermal response time fixed at a suitably short value . by miniaturization of the sample holder , the bias power required to reach a given temperature",
    "can be considerably reduced , while at the same time maintaining a practical thermal time constant .",
    "the noise power is limited intrinsically by the thermal ( johnson ) noise from the bolometer resistance at temperature @xmath24 .",
    "however , most real sensors show substantial excess noise , and the cernox 1050 sensor@xcite used in the present implementation of our experiment is no exception , showing approximately 40  db of excess noise in the presence of a 1.3  @xmath42a bias current .",
    "this completely accounts for the discrepancy between the minimum detectable power at 1.3  k of 17  fw calculated using eq .",
    "[ eqn : minpower ] assuming only johnson noise , and the experimentally determined value of 1.5  pw .",
    "for our method of bolometric detection to be most useful , it is necessary to deliver microwaves to the sample across a broad range of frequency and , at the same time , not only accurately control the polarization of the microwave field at the sample , but also maintain a fixed relationship between the field intensity at the sample under test and the field intensity at the reference sample .",
    "essential to this is the design of the microwave waveguide .",
    "we use a custom - made transmission line , shown in cross - section in fig .",
    "[ fig : endwall ] , that consists of a rectangular outer conductor that measures 8.90  mm @xmath2 4.06  mm in cross - section and a broad , flat centre conductor , or septum , that measures 4.95  mm @xmath2 0.91  mm .",
    "this supports a tem mode in which the magnetic fields lie in the transverse plane and form closed loops around the centre conductor , setting a fixed relationship between the microwave field strengths on either side of the septum . the line is terminated by shorting the centre conductor and outer conductor with a flat , metallic endwall",
    "this enforces an electric field node at the end of the waveguide , adjacent to which we locate the small platelet sample and reference , with their flat faces parallel and very close to the endwall .",
    "the broad centre conductor ensures spatially uniform fields over the dimensions of the sample , making it possible to drive screening currents selectively along a chosen crystallographic direction .",
    "the electrodynamics of the rectangular waveguide are discussed in more detail in appendix  [ app : modes ] . a strong variation in the power delivered to the sample as a function of frequency arises due to standing waves in the microwave circuit .",
    "in order to properly account for this , we have incorporated an _ in - situ _ normal - metal reference sample of known surface resistance that acts as an absolute power meter .",
    "this second sample is held in a position that is electromagnetically equivalent to the that of the test sample , on a separate thermal stage .",

    "one of the challenges of cryogenic microwave absorption measurements on small , low - loss samples is the design of the sample holder , which must measure and regulate the sample temperature , and yet contribute negligible dissipation compared to the sample .",
    "a widely used technique that satisfies these requirements is that of a sapphire hot - finger in vacuum,@xcite allowing the thermometry to be electromagnetically shielded from the microwave fields . in our apparatus",
    ", the sample holder is inserted through a hole that is beyond cut off for all operating frequencies . for ac calorimetric measurements ,",

    "initially , we chose samples cut from commercially available stainless - steel shim stock , a common choice in infrared spectroscopy work .",
    "calibration experiments produced erratic results which were eventually traced to the presence of anisotropic residual magnetism in the stainless steel .",
    "subsequently , we produced our own reference material , choosing an ag : au alloy ( 70:30 at.% made from 99.99% pure starting materials ) , because it exhibits a very simple phase diagram that guarantees homogeneity.@xcite by using an alloy , we ensure that the electrodynamics remain local at microwave frequencies , avoiding the potential complications arising from the anomalous skin effect.@xcite our sample was cut from a 93@xmath50  @xmath42 m thick foil having a measured residual dc resistivity value of @xmath51=5.28@xmath52 cm , constant below 20  k.    while the thermal stage for the reference sample is similar in design to that used for the sample under test , it uses a higher conductance stainless steel thermal weak - link ( in place of the quartz tube ) , since the dissipation of the normal metal calibration sample is orders of magnitude larger than that of a typical superconducting sample .",
    "because the apparatus was implemented as a retro - fit to an existing experiment , the reference thermal stage had to be mounted directly onto the body of the transmission line structure .",
    "although the cavity walls are superconducting to reduce their absorption , we use a nylon spacer to thermally isolate the base of the reference from the transmission line to avoid direct heating .",

    "as considered previously in our generic analysis , we operate the cernox bolometer with a constant dc current bias , typically a few @xmath42a , provided by the series combination of an alkaline battery ( 1.5  v or 9  v ) and bias resistor whose value is much larger than that of the cernox sensor . with the helium bath under temperature regulation , the choice of bias power sets the temperature of the sample for a given experiment , with no other temperature control necessary .",

    "the second step requires the calibration of the magnetic field strength at the sample , at each frequency , using the known absorption of the reference sample .",
    "we exploit the fact that the metallic reference sample experiences the same incident microwave field @xmath13 as the sample under test , guaranteed by conservation of magnetic flux .",
    "this ensures that taking the ratio of the absorbed power per unit surface area of each sample provides the ratio of the surface resistance values : @xmath62 the surface resistance of the unknown sample @xmath63 is then trivially found by multiplying the power - absorption ratio , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : metalcal ] we show such a measurement using two thin - platelet samples of our ag : au reference alloy , both at the base temperature of 1.2  k. the data reveal a ratio of 0.82 in the cryogenic apparatus , due to the fact that the centre conductor is offset from centre by 0.1  mm in the termination region , intensifying the fields on one side relative to the other .",

    "a number of other experimental tests were important to verify the proper operation of the system .",
    "frequency scans without samples mounted on the sapphire stages confirmed that background absorption due to the sapphire and tiny amount of vacuum grease used to affix the samples is negligible  it is unmeasurable at low frequency , and contributes no more than 2  @xmath1 to an @xmath11 measurement at 21  ghz .",
    "scans without a sample also confirmed that no significant leakage heat current propagates to the thermometers directly from the microwave waveguide .",
    "the high thermal stability of the cryostat system is due in part to the very large effective heat capacity of the pumped 4  litre liquid - helium bath at 1.2  k. in addition , it is always important to make certain the temperature modulations of the samples are sufficiently small that the response of the thermal stages remains in the linear regime .",
    "furthermore , measurements with the same sample located in different positions along the sapphire plate , with up to 0.5  mm displacement from the central location in the waveguide , confirmed that there is enough field homogeneity that our sample alignment procedure using an optical microscope is sufficient , and that samples of different sizes experience the same fields .    a very convincing verification of the technique is provided by the ability to compare broadband @xmath20 data with measurements of the _ same sample",

    "this would open interesting possibilities in the area of metals physics , such as high - resolution cyclotron and periodic - orbit resonance , as well as the study of vortex dynamics and vortex - core spectroscopy in superconductors .",
    "finally , further miniaturization of the experiment should also be possible : the ultimate goal would be to extend the frequency range of this type of spectroscopy so that is joins seamlessly on to the thz range now accessible using pulsed - laser techniques .",
    "the authors are indebted to pinder dosanjh for his technical assistance , as well as to ruixing liang for the ybacuo samples employed in these experiments .",
    "we also acknowledge financial support from the natural science and engineering research council of canada and the canadian institute for advanced research .",
    "we wish to calculate the temperature response of a simple thermal stage to a sinusoidal heat flux @xmath81 superimposed on a static temperature gradient .",
    "we consider an arrangement where the isothermal sample stage has neglible thermal mass and is connected to base temperature by a weak thermal link with distributed heat capacity @xmath82 per unit volume .",
    "it is a straightforward extension to include an additional lumped heat capacity for the isothermal stage ; once the lumped heat capacity dominates , the frequency response simplifies to that of a single - pole low - pass filter .",
    "however , in our case this is unnecessary : for electrodynamic measurements at low temperatures , the sample holder is required to be both electrically insulating and highly crystalline , and will therefore have very low heat capacity .",
    "here we consider the one - dimensional problem of a thin bar ( the quartz tube in our apparatus ) of length @xmath83 and cross - sectional area @xmath84 , with one end fixed at a base temperature @xmath22 while the other end is heated by a heat flux due to sample power absorption .",
    "the propagation of a heat current @xmath85 through the bar is constrained by the continuity equation @xmath86 and the thermal conductivity @xmath87 is defined by @xmath88 .",
    "together , these lead to the one - dimensional heat equation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the thermal diffusivity . defining a complex thermal diffusion length @xmath91 , the time - dependent part of the temperature profile can be written @xmath92 where @xmath93 is fixed by the heat - flux boundary condition : @xmath94 .",
    "this completely determines the frequency - dependent temperature rise of the sample stage : @xmath95 in the low frequency limit , the temperature rise reverts to the usual result : @xmath96 where , without loss of generality , we have set the phase of the input heat flux to zero . in the high frequency limit ,",
    "the thermal diffusion length becomes shorter than the weak link and the temperature rise is reduced , being given by : @xmath97 where @xmath98 . at finite frequencies , part of the heat flux",
    "is diverted into the distributed heat capacity of the thermal link . for a fixed input power ( and hence fixed temperature _",
    "gradient _ at the end of the thermal link ) this leads to smaller temperature rises and a decreased sensitivity of the bolometric method .",
    "clearly , the experimental sensitivity of the bolometric method will be optimized by operating in the low - frequency limit : @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "a consideration of the thermal diffusivity and dimensions of the weak - link must therefore be part of any plan to increase the modulation frequency .",
    "[ fig : thermalresponse ] shows the frequency response of the sample thermal stage in our apparatus when it was subjected to a sinusoidally varying heater power , normalized to the static response .",
    "included in the figure are fits to the distributed - heat - capacity model , eq .",
    "[ eqn : tempresponse ] and a single - pole low - pass filter response @xmath101 .",
    "although both curves fit the data well over most of the frequency range , the best - fit value of the time constant @xmath102 in the lumped - element model corresponds to a heat capacity much larger than the calculated heat capacity of the sapphire sample stage . instead",
    ", the value obtained from the fit is approximately half the heat capacity of the quartz tube , indicating the correct physics is that of heat diffusion in a distributed thermal system .     low temperature ( @xmath103  k ) measurements of the dynamic thermal response of the quartz - tube bolometer platform . curves on the plot show fits using lumped and distributed heat capacity models . ]",
    "in optimizing a microwave transmission line for the bolometric measurement of surface resistance the guiding aims must be : to deliver microwave power efficiently to the sample region , over as wide a frequency range as possible and with a well defined polarization ; to have regions of uniform microwave magnetic field at the sample and reference positions ; and , at these positions , to have a fixed , frequency - independent ratio between the field strengths .",
    "these aims can be met by using an impedance - matched ( 50  @xmath44 ) , single - mode coaxial line , with rectangular cross section and a broad , flat center conductor or septum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coaxmodes](i ) .",
    "in addition , the dimensions of the rectangular coaxial line should be chosen carefully , to prevent higher - order waveguide modes from entering the operating frequency range of the experiment , as these modes break the symmetry in field strength between sample and reference positions .",
    "this appendix outlines how to undertake the optimization .",
    "cross sections of the rectangular coaxial transmission line : ( i ) physical layout of the transmission line showing dimensions ( @xmath104 ) of the inner and outer conductors , and sample and reference positions ( shaded squares ) ; ( ii ) fields of the tem mode , showing how continuity of flux and a broad , flat inner conductor produce uniform , well polarized fields of equal intensity and opposite direction at the sample and reference positions ; ( iii ) fields of the te@xmath105 mode ; and ( iv ) fields of the te@xmath56 mode .",
    "( magnetic fields of the transverse electric modes contain a component along the direction of propagation and do not form closed loops in the transverse plane . )",
    "it is clear that the te@xmath56 mode is most harmful to the operation of the broadband apparatus : its magnetic fields have high intensity at the sample and reference positions and break the balance that otherwise exists in the tem mode . ]    a rectangular coaxial line , like any two - conductor line , supports a transverse electromagnetic ( tem ) wave at all frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : coaxmodes](ii ) shows its electric and magnetic field configurations .",
    "the tem mode has the desirable property that its magnetic fields lie in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation , forming closed loops around the centre conductor .",
    "conservation of magnetic flux then leads to a fixed , frequency - independent relation between the fields on either side of the septum .",
    "these fields will also be quite homogeneous , as long as the height @xmath21 of the centre conductor is large compared to the gap @xmath106 between the centre and outer conductors . to deliver microwave power efficiently to the sample region",
    "the characteristic impedance of the tem mode must be close to that of the cylindrical coaxial line used to bring microwaves into the cryostat .",
    "gunston @xcite has tabulated data on the impedance of rectangular coaxial line , and gives some useful approximate formulas .",
    "the following expression , due to brckelmann , is stated to be accurate to 10% for @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the relative permittivity of the dielectric filling the transmission line .",
    "conducting walls introduced along special electric equipotentials allow the waveguide modes of rectangular coaxial line to be mapped onto the fundamental mode of ridged waveguide , a problem extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the figures show the relabelling of dimensions in pyle s notation  @xcite as @xmath111 and @xmath112 . ]",
    "we now come to the question of what places an upper limit on the useful frequency range of the rectangular coaxial waveguide . at high frequencies",
    "our method , which incorporates an in - situ power meter , suffers a spectacular breakdown in the ratio of the relative strengths of the microwave magnetic fields at the sample and reference positions , as shown in figure  [ fig : metalcal ] .",
    "this is caused by the presence of higher - order waveguide modes , which have different character from that of the tem mode under the mid - plane reflection symmetries of the rectangular line .",
    "the waveguide modes with the lowest cut - off frequencies are the transverse electric modes te@xmath105 and te@xmath56 , shown in figures  [ fig : coaxmodes](iii ) and [ fig : coaxmodes](iv ) respectively .",
    "these have the property that magnetic fields on opposite sides of the septum point in the _ same _ direction .",
    "the fields of the tem mode , in contrast , are _ antiparallel _ , causing an admixture of tem and te modes to lack the important characteristic of equal field intensities at sample and reference positions .",
    "particularly damaging is the te@xmath56 mode , which is not screened by the septum and has high field intensity in the vicinity of the sample and reference . in principle",
    "it is possible to avoid exciting the transverse electric modes by building a very symmetric transmission line . in practice",
    ", however , we find this to be impossible  sufficiently large symmetry - breaking perturbations are always present .",
    "nevertheless , maintaining high symmetry is still desirable .",
    "a comparison of our results with calculations of the cut - off frequencies of the transverse electric modes shows that at frequencies where the higher order modes are free to propagate , they do not immediately cause a breakdown in field ratio : this only occurs when the transverse electric modes come into resonance .",
    "( this can be seen very clearly in figure  [ fig : metalcal ] . ) as a result , the range of operating frequency can be extended by as much as 50% just by shortening the final section of transmission line and carefully designing the transition between the cylindrical and rectangular sections .",
    "optimizing the range of single - mode operation of the rectangular transmission line requires a method for calculating the cut - off frequencies of the te@xmath105 and te@xmath56 modes .",
    "while waveguide modes in two - conductor rectangular transmission lines have not been extensively studied , their field configurations can be mapped onto a more common geometry : that of ridged waveguide",
    ". figure  [ fig : coaxmodes2 ] shows how .",
    "electric equipotentials run perpendicular to lines of electric flux , and special equipotentials , corresponding to local minima of the magnetic flux density , exist on the symmetry axes of the rectangle .",
    "a conducting wall can be introduced along these lines without disturbing the field distributions , thereby mapping each mode onto an equivalent ridged waveguide .",
    "figure  [ fig : coaxmodes2 ] illustrates the two different ways this is done , for the te@xmath105 and te@xmath56 modes respectively .",
    "a very early calculation of the cutoff frequency of ridged waveguide was carried out by pyle  @xcite and is notable for its simplicity , generality and enduring accuracy when compared to more recent numerical methods.@xcite pyle s approach is to solve for the transverse resonance condition of the waveguide , which is equivalent to finding the cut - off frequency @xmath113 .",
    "we have used this method in our design process , as it is easy to implement ( involving only algebraic equations ) and is accurate to several percent except when the septum becomes very thin .",
    "the length @xmath83 of the rectangular line , the cut - off frequency , and the discontinuity capacitance of the cylindrical - to - rectangular transition together determine the resonant frequencies @xmath114 of the transverse electric modes .",
    "there are two limiting cases , corresponding to open - circuit ( @xmath115 ) and short - circuit ( @xmath116 ) termination ( where @xmath117 is the wavelength along the guide ) , that follow from the waveguide dispersion relation .",
    "@xmath118 a high capacitance for the te modes at the transition from cylindrical to rectangular coax is clearly favourable : it better approximates the short circuit termination condition and leads to resonant frequencies at the upper end of the range .",
    "this effect is responsible for the difference in resonant frequencies between the scale model and the actual apparatus seen in figure  [ fig : metalcal ] .",
    "there is , however , a trade - off to be made : too large a transition capacitance for the tem mode will result in most of the microwave power being reflected before it reaches the sample .",
    "the dimensions of the rectangular guide in our apparatus are @xmath119  mm , @xmath120  mm , @xmath121  mm , @xmath122  mm and @xmath123  mm . the cut - off frequencies for the te@xmath105 and te@xmath56 modes are calculated to be 19.68  ghz and 15.38  ghz respectively .",
    "the quarter wave - resonances would then occur at 22.72  ghz and 19.12  ghz , and the half wave resonances at 30.06  ghz and 27.44  ghz .",
    "in this appendix we show how the microwave conductivity spectrum of a superconductor can be obtained from a measurement of its frequency - dependent surface resistance .",
    "this process is similar to the extraction of conductivity spectra in the infra - red frequency range from reflectance measurements . in both cases , we begin with incomplete information about the electrodynamic response : the bolometric technique described in this paper measures only the _ resistive _ part of the surface impedance ; and optical techniques typically obtain the magnitude , but not the phase , of the reflectance .",
    "however , the conductivity @xmath124 is a causal response function , and its real and imaginary parts are related by a kramers  krnig transform : @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes the principle part of the integral . at first sight",
    "we seem to have replaced one uncertainty , incomplete knowledge of the phase , by another , the finite frequency range over which the measurements have been made . however , a suitable extrapolation of the data out of the measured frequency range is usually possible and makes the transform a well - defined procedure in practice .",
    "we consider the limit of local electrodynamics , in which the microwave surface impedance @xmath127 is related to the complex conductivity in a straightforward manner by the expression @xmath128 very generally , the conductivity can be partitioned into a superfluid part @xmath129 , consisting of a zero - frequency delta function and an associated reactive term , and a normal - fluid component @xmath130 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the quasiparticle effective mass . in the clean - limit , where the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath133 is much less than the spectroscopic gap @xmath134 ,",
    "sum - rule arguments enable a clean partitioning of the conduction electron density @xmath135 into a superfluid density @xmath136 and a normal - fluid density @xmath137 .",
    "in this type of generalized two - fluid model,@xcite the temperature dependence of @xmath136 is determined phenomenologically from measurements of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath75 through the relation @xmath138^{-1}.\\ ] ] applying this , we can write the conductivity at finite frequencies as @xmath139.\\ ] ] from eq .  [ eqn : surfimped ] it is clear that @xmath54 is determined by both the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity .",
    "however , one simplification occurs at temperatures well below @xmath140 , where few thermally excited quasiparticles exist , and the low frequency reactive response is dominated by the superfluid . in this case , a good approximation to the relations becomes @xmath141 at higher frequencies and temperatures , a more complete treatment would account for quasiparticle contributions to field screening , which enter through @xmath142 .",
    "we use an iterative procedure to obtain the quasiparticle conductivity spectrum @xmath143 , starting from the good initial guess provided by eq .",
    "the process goes as follows .",
    "a phenomenological form that captures the key characteristics of the dataset but has no physical motivation , namely @xmath144 $ ] , is fitted to the spectrum and used to extrapolate out of the measured frequency range .",
    "the kramers  krnig transform ( eq .  [ kk ] ) can then be applied to obtain @xmath145 . with @xmath145 in hand , and with the superfluid contribution to @xmath146 known from measurements of the magnetic penetration depth ,",
    "a new extraction of the conductivity from the @xmath54 data is made , this time using the _ exact _ expression , eq .",
    "[ eqn : surfimped ] .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated to self - consistency .",
    "we find that the procedure is stable and converges rapidly , and is not sensitive to the details of the high - frequency extrapolation . also , the corrections are quite small for the low temperature dataset shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma1 ] : at the highest temperature and frequency they amount to a 7% change in @xmath147 .",
    "in addition , two independent experimental checks give us further assurance that we obtain the correct conductivity spectra .",
    "we first note that eq .",
    "[ eqn : surfimped ] contains an expression for the surface reactance @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , once we have measured the penetration depth and extracted the conductivity spectra from the @xmath54 data , we can predict the temperature dependence of the surface reactance at _ any _ frequency and compare with experiment .",
    "we have made this comparison at 22.7  ghz , with surface reactance data obtained on the same crystal , and find excellent agreement .",
    "we note that this is a frequency high enough for quasiparticle scattering to have a discernible effect on the surface reactance .",
    "a second verification of the conductivity extraction procedure is its ability to predict the spectral weight that resides _ outside _ the frequency window of the measurement .",
    "a corollary of the kramers  krnig relation  [ kk ] is the oscillator - strength sum rule @xmath149 in a superconductor , in the clean limit , the sum rule requires that any spectral weight disappearing from the superfluid density @xmath150 as temperature is raised must reappear as an increase in the frequency - integrated quasiparticle conductivity .",
    "we have carried out this comparison , which is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma1].@xcite the good agreement in the temperature dependence of the superfluid and normal - fluid densities is a strong verification of both the analysis procedure _ and _ the bolometric technique .                      in general , the thermal model of the bolometer stage",
    "should include a distributed heat capacity through which the thermal currents flow .",
    "however , we show in appendix  [ app : thermal ] that a necessary condition for optimal sensitivity is that the thermal weak link be operated in the low frequency limit where it _ is _ well approximated by a lumped thermal mass and a weak thermal link having negligible heat capacity .",
