    "the one - dimensional poisson equation , @xmath0 with dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath1 plays an important role in many branches of science .",
    "particularly , the poisson equation is essential in self - consistent calculations in solid state physics  @xcite . in general",
    ", we have to solve it numerically many times .",
    "therefore , is vital to have the fastest and the most accurate numerical scheme to solve it . in this article",
    ", we present a very efficient direct method , based on a numerov  @xcite sixth order numerical scheme , to solve the poisson equation numerically . because of its efficiency and simplicity",
    ", this new method can be used as a canonical numerical scheme to accurately solve the one - dimensional poisson equation .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "our numerical scheme is presented in section  [ sec : numerov ] .",
    "its linearization , together with a few discussions , are presented in section  [ sec : discus ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclus ] .",
    "let @xmath2 represents the solution of at the @xmath3-th point , @xmath4 , of an equally spaced net of step @xmath5 and dimension @xmath6 .",
    "let also @xmath7 represents the @xmath8-th derivative evaluated at the same point @xmath9 .",
    "then we can evaluate the solution @xmath10 at the nearest neighborhood points @xmath11 of @xmath9 using taylor series  @xcite , @xmath12    the basic idea in the numerov approach is to eliminate the fourth order derivative in the expression @xmath13 where @xmath14 to obtain the sixth order three - point numerical scheme @xmath15 where we chose @xmath16 and , consequently , @xmath17 . in a similar way",
    ", we can eliminate the third order derivative from @xmath18 where @xmath19 to obtain the fifth order three - point numerical scheme @xmath20 for the first derivative of @xmath10 , where we chose @xmath21 and , consequently , @xmath22 .",
    "so far , the three - point numerical scheme is an iterative method , i.e. , given two informations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we can calculate @xmath25 .",
    "one difficulty of this iterative method is related with the dirichlet boundary conditions : they are known only at end - points @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we can not initiate our iterative scheme .",
    "fortunately , the recurrence relation in is linear with constant coefficients .",
    "these two features imply we can find an unique solution to it , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 must be expressed in terms of @xmath31 ( the dirichlet boundary conditions ) , @xmath32 now we have an analytical sixth order numerical scheme to solve accurately the poisson equation with the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it should be mentioned that the analytical third order numerical scheme presented by hu and oconnell  @xcite , making use of tridiagonal matrices , can also be derived by the present approach restricted to the third order , @xmath33 where @xmath34",
    "although we have found a very accurate analytical direct method to solve the one - dimensional poisson equation with dirichlet boundary conditions , namely , the sixth order numerov scheme , it has one undesirable feature : its execution time is proportional to the square of the grid dimension",
    ". fortunately it can be linearized .",
    "first , we create a vector @xmath35 , whose components are the partial sums @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "next , we create a second vector @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . we also need a third vector @xmath41 with @xmath42 and a fourth vector @xmath43 with the complete sums @xmath44 . using these new vectors ,",
    "our sixth order numerov scheme can be rewritten as follows , @xmath45.\\ ] ] this numerical scheme has now a linear execution time proportional to five times the grid dimension @xmath6 .",
    "let us use a gaussian density , @xmath46 to verify the accuracy and the efficiency of the non - linear numerical scheme , as well as the linear numerical scheme .",
    "the solution for the poisson equation , along with the boundary conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the error function , @xmath51    figure  [ f1 ] shows the execution time as a function of the grid dimension @xmath6 for three cases . in one case ( the dotted line ) ,",
    "the numerical solution was computed by the non - linear third order numerical scheme . in the second case ( the dashed line ) , the numerical solution was computed by the non - linear sixth order numerical scheme . in the last case ( the solid line ) , the numerical solution was computed by the linear sixth order numerical scheme . at @xmath52 , the execution time of the non - linear third ( sixth )",
    "order numerical scheme is approximately 145 ( 51 ) times the execution time of the linear sixth order numerical scheme .",
    "clearly , we can see that the linearization process described above plays an essential role in the present numerov scheme .    in order to measure the accuracy of the present numerov scheme",
    ", we can compute the euclidean norm @xmath53^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 stands for the exact solution and @xmath55 stands for the numerical solution .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows ( right vertical axis ) a comparasion between two euclidean norms : one ( dashed line ) using the third - order numerical scheme and the other ( solid line ) using the sixth - order numerical scheme .",
    "note that , at @xmath56 , the exact euclidean norm of the third - order scheme is approximately four orders of magnitude above the exact euclidean norm of the sixth - order scheme .",
    "naturally , we can see that the sixth - order numerical scheme is much more accurate and efficient than the third - order numerical scheme . of course",
    ", we do nt know the exact solution in practical applications .",
    "in that case , the best we can do is to compute the mean euclidean norm of the numerical solution @xmath55 , @xmath57 this mean euclidean norm can be used as a convergency criterion , as shown in figure  [ f2 ] ( left vertical axis ) .",
    "we have applied the numerov method to derive a sixth - order numerical scheme to solve the one - dimensional poisson equation with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting recurrence relations were exactly solved and the corresponding execution time was linearized [ see ] in such way to avoid the handling of a dense matrix .",
    "therefore , the numerical scheme is both accurate and efficient as illustrated in figure  [ fig : tempos ] .",
    "moreover , it is extremely ease to implement in any numerical or algebraic computer language .",
    "as pointed by j.  m.  blatt  @xcite , the numerov method is both a three - point method , which implies it is stable , and of highest order , which implies it is accurate .",
    "all these features make the numerical scheme the canonical method of choice for the integration of the poisson equation .",
    "the author wish to thank rafael casalverini for useful discussions and fapesp for financial supports ."
