    "2003 ) etc .",
    "provide evidence that we may live in low mass density universe i. e. @xmath8 ( riess 1986 ) .",
    "the predictions of observations lead to a convincing belief in modern cosmology that a part of universe is filled up with dark energy @xmath9 , which may be addressed by suitable cosmological constant .",
    "there are significant observational evidence that the expansion of the universe is undergoing a late time acceleration ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 , 2004 ; efstathiou et al . 2002 ; spergel et al . 2003 ; allen et al . 2004 ; sahni and starobinsky 2000 ; peebles and ratra 2003 ; padmanabhan 2003 ; lima 2004 ) .",
    "this , in other words , amounts to saying that in the context of einstein s general theory of relativity some sort of dark energy , constant or that varies only slowly with time and space dominates the current composition of cosmos .",
    "the origin and nature of such an accelerating field poses a completely open question .",
    "the main conclusion of these observations is that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "+ among many possible alternatives , the simplest and most theoretically appealing possibility for dark energy is the energy density stored on the vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , a constant @xmath1 can not explain the huge difference between the cosmological constant inferred from observation and the vacuum energy density resulting from quantum field theories . in an attempt to solve this problem ,",
    "variable @xmath1 was introduced such that @xmath1 was large in the early universe and then decayed with evolution ( dolgov 1983 ) . since the pioneering work of dirak ( 1938 ) , who proposed a theory with a time varying gravitational coupling constant @xmath11 , a number of cosmological models with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been recently studied by several authors ( arbab 2003 ; sistero 1991 ; sattar and vishwakarma 1997 ; pradhan and chakrabarty 2001 ; singh et al .",
    "+ to describe the relativistic theory of viscosity , eckart ( 1940 ) made the first attempt .",
    "the theories of dissipation in eckart formulation suffers from serious short- coming , viz . ,",
    "causality and stability ( hiskock and lindblom 1985 ; hiskock 1986 ) regardless of the choice of equation of state .",
    "the problem arises due to first order nature of the theory , since it considers only first order deviation from equilibrium .",
    "it has been shown that the problems of the relativistic imperfect fluid may be resolved by including higher order deviation terms in the transport equation ( hiskock and salmonson 1991 ) .",
    "isreal and stewart ( 1970 ) and pavon ( 1991 ) developed a fully relativistic formulation of the theory taking into account second order deviation terms in the theory , which is termed as `` transient '' or `` extended '' irreversible thermodynamics ( eit ) .",
    "the crucial difference between the standard eckart and the extended isreal - stewart transport equations is that the latter is a differential evolution equations , while the former is an algebraic relation . in irreversible thermodynamics ,",
    "the entropy is no longer conserved , but grows according to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "bulk viscosity arises typically in the mixtures either of different species or of species but with different energies .",
    "the solution of the full causal theory are well behaved for all the times .",
    "therefore the best currently available theory for analyzing dissipative processes in the universe is the full isreal - stewart theory ( fis ) .",

    "+ the simplest of anisotropic models are bianchi type - i homogeneous models whose spatial sections are flat but the expansion or contraction rate are direction dependent . for studying the possible effects of anisotropy in the early universe on present day observations many researchers ( huang 1990 ; chimento et al . 1997 ; lima 1996 ; lima and carvalho 1994 ; pradhan and singh 2004 ; pradhan and pandey 2006 ; saha 2005 , 2006a , 2006b ) have investigated bianchi type - i models from different point of view . in this paper",

    "* the cosmological constant @xmath72 is found to be decreasing function of time and it approaches to small positive value at late time .",

    "* the temperature of universe in derived model is infinitely high at early stage of evolution of universe but it approaches to small positive value at later stage .",

    "thus @xmath143 and @xmath140 , turn out to be the condition of flatness in the derived model .",
    "it is important to note here that for @xmath140 , shear scalar vanishes but the bulk viscosity contributes to the expansion of universe and for positive value of @xmath43 , the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath110 decreases with time . +",
    "* the distance modulus curve of derived model is in good agreement with sn ia data ( see * fig . 4 * and table 1 ) . +",
    "* the age of universe is given by @xmath144    finally , the model presented in this paper is accelerating , shearing and starts expanding with big bang singularity .",
