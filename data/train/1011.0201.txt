    "ice giants , the cores of gas giants and protoplanets that later form terrestial planets , are generally believed to have formed by coagulation from small planetesimals . understanding the evolution of the size distribution of growing protoplanets , their velocity dispersion and the interplay between the two is crucial for shedding light onto the planet formation process . here",
    ", we study the runaway growth of protoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their subsequent velocity evolution .",
    "runaway growth can occur when the accretion cross section of protoplanets is enhanced by gravitational focusing . since , gravitational focusing is strongest for the largest bodies , the radii of larger protoplanets run away from that of smaller .",
    "this leads to a size distribution that develops a tail containing a small number of large protoplanets .",
    "it is however not always clear what fraction of the total mass participates in this runaway growth and what protoplanet size distribution such runaway growth gives rise to @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address both of these questions . in the following sections , we discuss runaway growth in the context of the kuiper belt , which is an ideal laboratory to test our results , since it is a remnant of the primordial solar system , where planet formation never reached completion .",
    "the results however , also apply to runaway growth during planet formation and growth in debris disk , as long as gas plays no significant role in the accretion and damping of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the kuiper belt consists of a disk of icy bodies located at the outskirts of our planetary system , just beyond the orbit of neptune and contains some of the least processed bodies in our solar system .",
    "motivated by the discovery of the first kuiper belt object @xcite after pluto and charon , several groups conducted large scale surveys to characterize the kuiper belt .",
    "these efforts led to the discovery of more than 1200 objects in the kuiper belt to date .",
    "the kuiper belt size distribution contains many important clues concerning the formation of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , their effective strength and their collisional evolution @xcite .",
    "it also provides a snapshot of an earlier stage of planet formation , which was erased elsewhere in the solar system where planet formation proceeded all the way to completion .",
    "the cumulative size distribution of kbos larger than @xmath8 is well described by a single power - law given by @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the number of objects with radii greater than @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is the power - law index .",
    "kuiper belt surveys find that the size distribution for kbos with radii greater than about 50  km follows this power - law with @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies roughly equal mass per logarithmic mass interval .",
    "this size distribution is a relic of the accretion history in the kuiper belt and therefore provides valuable insights into the formation of large kbos ( @xmath12 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "observations suggest that there is a break in the power - law size distribution at smaller kbo sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the break in the size distribution is generally attributed to collisions that break - up small kbos ( i.e.,@xmath13 ) and modify their size distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kbo size distribution below the break is still poorly constrained , although some encouraging progress has been made recently in probing the abundance of sub - km - sized kbos by stellar occultations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented in this paper focuses on the size distribution of large kbos ( @xmath12 ) , which is well constrained by observations and which sheds light onto the formation of kbos , protoplanets and accretion processes that could be ongoing in other debris disks .",
    "numerical coagulation simulations have been successful in reproducing the observed kbo size distribution .",
    "such simulations typically find that the accretion processes of kbos yield a power - law size distribution with @xmath14 for 10 - 100  km and larger objects @xcite , which is consistent with the observed power - law size distribution . despite their success ,",
    "the reason for the actual slope of the distribution has so far not been explained by such simulations . in this paper",
    ", we offer an explanation for the slope of the kbo size distribution and for the amount of mass in the large kbos that are observed in today s kuiper belt .",
    "specifically we find a power - law index of @xmath15 and a total mass in large kbos of @xmath16 of the initial planetesimal mass , which is consistent with the current observed mass in the kuiper belt .",
    "we also make a prediction for the maximum mass ratio of kuiper belt binaries that formed by dynamical processes , for example , by three body interactions , and show that our prediction is in good agreement with the observations .",
    "although our work focuses on the kuiper belt , the results also apply to early stages of planet formation and protoplanetary growth in debris disks .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  2 we analytically describe the growth of large kbos , including their velocity dispersion and derive the slope of the kbo size distribution .",
    "we confirm our analytic results in  3 with coagulation simulations . in  4 , we discuss how semi - collisional accretion , binary mergers and frequent planetesimal collisions would affect our results .",
    "we show that our results on the kbo growth and velocity dispersion have interesting implications for the formation of kuiper belt binaries and predict the maximum mass ratio for binaries that formed by dynamical processes in  5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  6 .",
    "in order to gain an analytic understanding of the growth processes of large kbos and the associated velocity evolution we use the two - groups approximation @xcite . the ` two - groups approximation ' consists of the identification of two groups of objects , small ones , that contain most of the total mass with mass surface density @xmath0 , and large ones , that contain only a small fraction of the total mass with mass surface density @xmath17 .",
    "we define @xmath2 as the mass surface density in a single logarithmic mass interval , that includes the largest bodies formed at a given time .",
    "in contrast @xmath0 is defined as the total mass in small objects .    within the framework of the ` two - groups approximation '",
    "we arrive at the following picture for kbo growth .",
    "initially all the mass is in small bodies . as the small bodies start to accrete each other , large bodies begin to form . to simplify the argument",
    ", we only consider the mass surface density of the small and large bodies here , ignoring intermediate size bodies for now . as we show later , the large and small bodies alone determine the velocity dispersion for bodies of all sizes and only the large bodies grow significantly . in the initial stage",
    ", @xmath2 grows due to the accretion of small bodies .",
    "therefore the size of the largest bodies and the total mass in large bodies increases with time . during this growth",
    "phase the velocity dispersion of the small bodies increases due to viscous stirring by the large bodies .",
    "the velocity dispersion of large bodies is damped by dynamical friction provided by the small bodies .",
    "@xmath2 continues to grow until the growth of large kbos by accretion of comparable size objects starts to compete with growth by accretion of small bodies . from then on",
    ", @xmath2 remains roughly constant in a given logarithmic mass interval , while the size of the large kbos grows linearly with time .",
    "how the kbo growth ended and how exactly the small bodies were lost from the kuiper belt are still the subject of ongoing research and are unimportant for the purpose of this paper and we therefore will not discuss them here further . we confirm the outlined kbo growth analytically and with numerical simulations .",
    "we show that the mass - ratio , @xmath18 , is not arbitrary but an outcome of kbo growth .",
    "large kbos viscously stir the small bodies , increasing the small bodies velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "as a result @xmath19 grows on the same timescale as @xmath6 , as long as the small bodies experience no significant damping by either gas or mutual collisions , which are , most likely , not yet important ( see section [ s3 ] ) .",
    "we can therefore write the evolution of the small bodies velocity dispersion as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the orbital frequency around the sun , @xmath6 the radius of the the large bodies and @xmath22 is their material density .",
    "the hill velocity of the large bodies is @xmath23 , which is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hill radius , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mass of the sun , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass and semi - major - axis of the large kbos .",
    "finally , @xmath30 and is @xmath31 at the distance of the kuiper belt .",
    "we assumed in writing the expression for @xmath19 that @xmath32 , we will verify that this is the correct and self - consistent velocity regime for @xmath19 at the end of this section .",
    "initially , the large bodies grow by accreting the small ones . their growth rate is given by @xmath33 where we assumed that @xmath34 , which we verify later in this section .",
    "equating the rates from equations ( [ e02 ] ) and ( [ e03 ] ) and solving for @xmath19 we find @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the velocity @xmath36 of large kbos increases due to mutual viscous stirring , but is damped by dynamical friction from the sea of small bodies such that @xmath37 .",
    "the competition between the stirring and damping can be written as @xmath38 balancing the stirring and damping rates for @xmath36 and substituting for @xmath19 from equation ( [ e2 ] ) into equation ( [ e2_3 ] ) , we find @xmath39 having derived expressions for the large and small bodies velocity dispersions we now turn to examining the growth in more detail .",
    "expressions similar to the ones above have been widely used in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in these works @xmath18 was treated as a free parameter . here",
    "we present our method for deriving @xmath18 and calculate its value during runaway growth .    within our ` two - groups approximation '",
    "large bodies have two distinct modes for growth . in the first",
    ", they can grow by the accretion of small bodies . in the second ,",
    "they grow by accreting objects comparable to their own size .",
    "the growth rate for large kbos is given by @xmath40 where we used the accretion rate corresponding to sub - hill velocity dispersions for large bodies and the corresponding rate for @xmath41 for small bodies .",
    "the first term in expression ( [ e4 ] ) describes the growth of large kbos by the accretion of small bodies and the second corresponds to the growth of large kbos by accreting objects of their own size . substituting the expression for @xmath19 from equation ( [ e2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath42 comparing the two terms in expression ( [ e5 ] ) we find that they contribute about equally to the growth of large kbos , if @xmath43 therefore , growth of large objects will be dominated by the accretion of small bodies , if @xmath44 . if on the other hand @xmath45 , then accretion of comparable size objects will be the dominant mode of growth provided that @xmath36 remains less than the hill velocity . since initially @xmath44 it follows that the growth of large kbos was at the beginning dominated by the accretion of small bodies , as assumed in equation ( [ e03 ] ) .",
    "this mode of growth continues until @xmath46 at which stage accretion of comparable size bodies starts to compete with growth by accretion of small bodies . from then on ,",
    "large kbos grow in roughly equal amounts by accreting small bodies and by merging with comparably - sized kbos . as a result @xmath2 remains constant , since its increase due to accretion of small bodies",
    "is counteracted by a decrease due to the accretion of large kbos .",
    "the radii of large kbos grows linearly with time ( see equation [ [ e5 ] ] ) .",
    "we find it very encouraging that the observed mass in large kbos in each logarithmic size interval estimated from recent kuiper belt surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is about @xmath47 of that of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) @xcite extrapolated to a heliocentric distance of 40  au .",
    "the observed mass in large kbos ( @xmath12 ) is therefore consistent with @xmath48 and with the hypothesis that they formed by coagulation in the kuiper belt from an mmsn . the growth of kbos ended in this runaway phase with @xmath49 . in the context of planet formation",
    "this phase of runaway growth is terminated by the onset of oligarchic growth , when each large body dominates the stirring in its own feeding zone , allowing @xmath2 to become comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "given this understanding of the kbo growth we now show that our choices for the velocity regimes of @xmath19 and @xmath36 are self - consistent with this picture . substituting @xmath48 into equation ( [ e2 ] ) , we find that @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that @xmath19 is about a few times the hill velocity of the large bodies .",
    "we note here that our derivation of the expression for @xmath19 , specifically equating equations ( [ e03 ] ) and ( [ e02 ] ) , remains valid even when the large bodies contribute significantly to the growth of large kbos , because the growth rates due to the accretion of small and large bodies are comparable . evaluating equation ( [ e3 ] )",
    "we find that @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the velocity dispersion of large bodies was sub - hill ( i.e. @xmath34 ) during the formation of large 100-km - sized kbos while that of the small bodies was super - hill ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "this confirms that we used the correct velocity regime for @xmath19 and @xmath36 in the derivation of the kbo accretion rates above , ensuring that our treatment is self - consistent .    rewriting equation ( [ e6 ] ) as @xmath52 as we have shown above , @xmath2 of the largest bodies is constant with a value of @xmath53 .",
    "once large bodies form , their mass per logarithmic mass interval is , apart from a very brief period ( see section [ subhill2 ] ) , preserved .",
    "this is because bodies smaller than the largest objects , do not grow significantly on the growth timescale of the largest objects , i.e. the growth is in the runaway regime ( see section [ superhill ] ) .",
    "furthermore , such smaller bodies are also not efficiently consumed by larger objects .",
    "their mass surface density and size distribution are therefore frozen ( see section [ superhill ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is constant in time , which results in @xmath54 since @xmath55 .",
    "this implies a power - law index @xmath56 ( see equation ( [ e1 ] ) ) for large kbos .",
    "our work suggests that the growth of large kbos resulted from the accretion of small and large kbos alike and that this mode of growth in the runaway regime gave rise to the observed size distribution of large kbos .",
    "we confirm this result in section [ s2 ] using coagulation simulations .",
    "our findings are consistent with direct observations of the size distribution of large kbos @xcite and also agree with results from numerical coagulation simulations that model the growth of kbos carried out by other groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far we have only considered two sizes of bodies , small ones and large ones .",
    "we now turn our attention to intermediate size bodies with radii @xmath57 , mass surface density @xmath58 and velocity dispersion @xmath59 .    in sections",
    "[ superhill ] and [ subhill2 ] , we show that @xmath58 is of the order @xmath2 .",
    "this is because large bodies form by accreting small bodies until their mass surface density reaches @xmath60 . from then on , the mass surface density remains roughly constant in a given logarithmic mass interval .",
    "@xmath61 because once larger bodies form , the velocity dispersion of the now intermediate sized bodies quickly grows to super hill velocities ( i.e. @xmath62 ) , which implies that such intermediate sized bodies do not grow significantly on the growth timescale of the largest kbos and that they are not consumed efficiently by the larger objects .",
    "the size distribution of such intermediate sized bodies and @xmath58 therefore remain constant . during the brief period",
    "over which @xmath63 , intermediate sized bodies are efficiently accreted by the largest objects , but we show in section [ subhill2 ] that this phase is very short and that it extends over less than a factor of 2 in radius . as a result , @xmath58 is of the order of , but slightly depleted compared to , @xmath2 .",
    "there are three different velocity regimes for intermediate sized bodies that we have to consider separately . in the first regime",
    "the intermediate sized bodies velocity dispersion exceeds the hill velocity of the largest bodies , i.e. @xmath62 , and the bodies themselves are sufficiently small such that their velocity dispersion is not efficiently damped by dynamical friction . in other words ,",
    "the dynamical friction timescale for these intermediate sized bodies exceeds the growth timescale of the large bodies .",
    "the velocity dispersion of these bodies is therefore dominated by gravitational stirring from the large bodies and it grows on the same timescales as the size of the large bodies .",
    "this implies that @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 where we substituted @xmath46 from equation ( [ e6 ] ) in the last step . equating the dynamical friction timescale for bodies of size @xmath57 to the growth timescale of the large bodies and solving for @xmath57",
    ", we have @xmath67 this implies that @xmath65 for intermediate sized bodies with @xmath68 and smaller . for bodies above this size , damping by dynamical friction",
    "is important .    in the second velocity regime , which applies for bodies larger than @xmath69 and that have @xmath62",
    ", the evolution of the velocity dispersion is dominated by gravitational stirring from the large bodies and damping by dynamical friction generated by the small bodies .",
    "this yields a velocity dispersion that is governed by @xmath70 balancing the stirring and damping rates and substituting @xmath71 , we find that @xmath59 is given by @xmath72 where we substituted for @xmath19 from equation ( [ e2 ] ) and used @xmath73 in the last step . equation ( [ e10 ] ) yields that @xmath74 for kbos with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 for bodies with @xmath77 .",
    "this implies that kbos with radii smaller than @xmath78 have super - hill velocities ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) and those with radii larger than @xmath78 will have sub - hill velocities ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the growth of intermediate sized bodies that have @xmath62 and @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 substituting for @xmath19 from equation ( [ e2 ] ) and using again the result that @xmath46 we can write the above expression as @xmath81 where the first term corresponds to growth by the accretion of small bodies and the second term to growth by mergers of comparable sized bodies . since @xmath82 , we find when comparing the magnitude of the two growth terms in equation ( [ e12 ] ) , that the growth is dominated by the accretion of small bodies .",
    "we assumed that @xmath58 is of the order of @xmath2 , which we confirm in section [ subhill2 ] .",
    "intermediate sized bodies with @xmath83 therefore grow predominantly by accreting small bodies and their growth rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath84 compared to bodies of size @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that bodies of size @xmath57 do not get the chance to grow , compared to the growth time scale of bodies of size @xmath6 .",
    "these intermediate sized bodies do not contribute significantly to the growth of the large bodies . when examining the contributions from bodies with @xmath62 to the growth of bodies of size @xmath6 , we have @xmath85 where the first and second term correspond to growth by merging with bodies of size @xmath6 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "since the first term in equation ( [ e41 ] ) exceeds the second , large bodies grow predominantly by accreting small bodies and large bodies . intermediate sized bodies with @xmath62 are not important for this growth .",
    "furthermore , such intermediate sized bodies are only inefficiently accreted by bodies of size @xmath6 .",
    "this is apparent when examining the rate of change of their surface density due to accretion onto bodies of size @xmath6 : @xmath86 comparing equation ( [ e42 ] ) with equation ( [ e4 ] ) , we find that @xmath58 does not change significantly on the growth timescale of the large bodies , which implies that their surface density is not altered due to accretion onto large bodies . as a result",
    "the mass surface density per logarithmic mass interval of intermediate sized bodies with @xmath62 remains constant in time .",
    "intermediate sized bodies that are about half the size of the large bodies and larger will have a velocity dispersion that is smaller than the large bodies hill velocity .",
    "the evolution of the velocity dispersion of such intermediate sized bodies is determined by gravitational stirring from large bodies and damping by dynamical friction generated by the small bodies .",
    "the expression for the evolution of @xmath59 can be written as @xmath88 balancing the stirring and damping rates and substituting @xmath71 , we can write @xmath59 as @xmath89 where we substituted for @xmath19 from equation ( [ e2 ] ) and used @xmath73 in the last step .",
    "strictly speaking , we should multiply the right hand - side of equation ( [ e14 ] ) by a logarithmic factor , which is given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is equal to @xmath57 , if @xmath92 . if @xmath93 then @xmath94 is the radius that corresponds to bodies with a velocity dispersion that is less than or equal to @xmath95 .",
    "the base of the logarithm is the same as the base of the logarithmic mass interval over which @xmath2 is defined .",

    "is dominated by the accretion of small bodies . in the second case , which @xmath103 , the rate of growth of bodies with radii @xmath57 is @xmath104 where we substituted again for @xmath19 from equation [ e2 ] and used @xmath46 .",
    "the first term corresponds to growth by the accretion of small bodies and the second to growth by merger of comparable sized bodies . comparing the magnitude of the two growth terms in equation ( [ e18 ] )",
    "we find that , unlike in the regime discussed above , the growth of bodies with radius @xmath57 is dominated by the accretion of similar sized bodies rather than by the accretion of small bodies , again assuming that @xmath58 is of the order of @xmath2 , which we show below .",

    "strictly speaking , we should also have included this logarithmic factor in the derivation of equation ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "however , since this logarithmic factor only provides a small correction it does not warrant to be included here , since we have been neglecting factors of order unity throughout .",
    "although the overall growth proceeds in the runaway regime ( i.e , @xmath108/dt)/(d \\rm{log}[r']/dt)=r / r'$ ] ) , large bodies with @xmath92 grow in an orderly fashion with respect to each other if @xmath56 , which implies that their radii converge .",
    "this leads to a steepening in the size distribution at very large radii , but only for bodies with radii that have a corresponding velocity dispersion such that @xmath92 , which corresponds to less than a factor of 2 in radius .",
    "the largest effect this can have is to reduce @xmath2 by a factor of @xmath109 , such that @xmath110 , since orderly growth will cease when @xmath111 .",
    "intermediate sized bodies with @xmath63 significantly contribute to the growth of large bodies , since @xmath112 where the first and second term correspond to growth by merging with bodies of size @xmath6 and @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "the mass surface density per logarithmic mass interval of intermediate sized bodies with @xmath63 gets depleted , because such bodies are efficiently consumed by large bodies . however , since the size range is very small , such bodies are only depleted by factor of a few before their velocity dispersions become super - hill at which point they are no longer efficiently accreted .",
    "the orderly growth of bodies with @xmath92 relative to each other and the efficient consumption of bodies with @xmath63 are responsible for the steepening of the kbo size distribution seen at @xmath116 in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "in addition , we neglect effects of gas damping and possible dynamical stirring from neptune .",
    "we investigate the kbo growth in a single annulus located at roughly 40  au from the sun with a width of about 10  au .",
    "most of our simulations start with a total mass of about 40 earth masses in small planetesimals , which corresponds to @xmath117 .",
    "this mass surface density is consistent with extrapolations of the mmsn @xcite to 40  au , after it has been enhanced about 6 fold as required for the formation of uranus and neptune ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we follow the mass growth and the evolution of the velocity dispersion of the kbos using safronov s statistical approach @xcite .",
    "since we are primarily concerned with the initial growth phase , we assume here that all collisions lead to accretion .",
    "this assumption is justified during the initial kbo growth and remains justified even once the planetesimal s velocity dispersion has been excited above its own escape velocity as long as the growth timescale of the large kbos is short compared to the planetesimal - planetesimal collision time .",
    "this condition is generally fulfilled , if the initial planetesimals are of the order of a kilometer in size or larger , since , for 1-km - sized bodies , the planetesimal - planetesimal collision time is comparable to the formation time of pluto .",
    "we therefore neglect the effect of destructive planetesimal collisions here , but we discuss how they would effect our results , had they been important , in section 4 .    below we give the relevant stirring , damping and accretion rates that determine the growth and velocity evolution in the kuiper belt .",
    "a detailed derivation of the these rates can , for example , be found in @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate between bodies of two different mass bins is given by @xmath118 where the subscripts ` s ' and ` b ' correspond to the mass bin with the smaller and larger bodies , respectively .",

    "note , we quote here the sub - hill accretion rate applicable to large objects , since the velocity dispersion of the small bodies is super - hill throughout the growth .",
    "the corresponding velocity evolution for each mass bin is dominated by the following processes .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the mass bin that corresponds to the smaller objects is viscously stirred by the object in the larger mass bin at a rate given by @xmath122 the velocity dispersion of the bodies in the larger of the two mass bin is in turn damped by the smaller bodies .",
    "the damping rate of the large bodies velocity dispersion is given by @xmath123 we implemented the above equations in our coagulation code and followed the growth and velocity evolution of the various mass bins .",
    "as initial conditions we start with an equivalent of about 40 earth masses , in 1-km sized planetesimals with an initial velocity dispersion of 3 times their hill velocity .",
    "we follow the kbo growth and velocity evolution of the different mass bins for 70  myrs .",
    "the results of our coagulation simulation are shown in figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of the cumulative mass distribution , the cumulative number distribution and the velocity dispersion during kbo growth as a function of time .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig1 ] that the growth and velocity evolution become self - similar once @xmath124 , i.e. the shape of the size - distribution and velocity - distribution remains unchanged , while the maximum kbo size continues to grow .",
    "the two upper panels of figure [ fig1 ] and figure [ fig2 ] show that the size - distribution of large kbos ( @xmath12 ) indeed follows a power - law with @xmath56 as predicted by our analytic treatment in section [ s1 ] .",
    "this implies a roughly equal amount of mass per logarithmic mass bin for large kbos .",
    "moreover , the middle panel of figure [ fig1 ] and figure [ fig2 ] show that the mass ratio of large to small kbos , i.e. @xmath18 , found in our coagulation simulation agrees very well with our analytic prediction that @xmath125 .",
    "the simulations confirm our analytic results and suggest that the total mass in large objects that we see in the kuiper belt is not arbitrary but an outcome of the kbo growth and that it is roughly @xmath47 of the initial planetesimals mass .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the actual observed mass in large kbos and formation from a mmsn type disk .",
    "our work therefore suggests that the kuiper belt did not contain two to three order of magnitude more mass in large kbos as has been proposed by some models @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion from our coagulation simulation and our analytic results derived in section [ s1 ] .",
    "it displays very good agreement between the velocity dispersion that we derived analytically for the various size regimes , and the results from our coagulation simulation .",
    "figures [ fig1]-[fig3 ] show that our analytic work captures the essential features of kbo growth and that analytic theory and the numerical coagulation results are in excellent agreement .",
    "we are able to successfully explain the slope ( @xmath56 ) and amplitude ( @xmath126 ) of the large kbo size distribution and the evolution of the velocity dispersion in the various velocity and size regimes .",
    "[ htp ]    [ htp ]      we performed an additional set of coagulation simulations with different initial conditions .",
    "in the first set we started with most of the mass in small 1-km - sized objects , just as before , but added a second population of larger 10-km - sized kbos that contained @xmath47 of the total mass .",
    "all bodies were started with a velocity dispersion equal to 3 times their hill velocity and we followed their growth and velocity evolution .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the result of this growth ( points ) and a comparison with the cumulative mass distribution at various times for kbos that grew from a single population of 1-km sized planetesimals ( lines ) .",
    "the similarity between the two distributions is striking .",
    "the same power - law for the large kbo size distribution emerges and the mass ratio in large and small kbos becomes also the same in both simulations .",
    "these results highlight the power of the ` two groups approximation ' that we used to derive the analytic results in section [ s1 ] and validate our assertion that the growth of large kbos develops towards a state where small and large bodies contribute about equally to the growth .",
    "the overall growth timescale to reach pluto - mass objects differs in these two simulations .",
    "starting from 40 earth masses in small planetesimals , it takes in our simulations about 70 - 80  myrs to form pluto - sized objects if initially all kbos are 1-km in radius but only 40 - 50  myrs if , in addition to the 1-km - sized objects , there also existed a small population of 10-km - sized kbos .",
    "the difference in the growth time results from the timescale it takes 1-km - sized objects to grow into 10-km sized bodies , if none are already present .",
    "when only comparing the growth timescale from 50-km - sized objects to 1000-km sized objects , we find that they are the same in the two scenarios ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , confirming that it is the initial growth of objects to tens of kilometers in size that give rise to the overall difference in pluto - formation time between the two simulations .",
    "the final shape of the kbo size - distribution and the total mass in large kbos ( as a fraction of the initial mass ) is therefore independent of the initial size distribution of the planetesimals .",
    "we also find the same kbo size distribution and overall mass in large kbos , if the initial planetesimals have a power - law size distribution with various power - law indexes and radii ranging from 1 to 10-km .",
    "in addition , we confirm that our results are independent of the details of the initial planetesimal velocity dispersion , as long as it is below their escape velocity .",
    "[ htp ]    we also performed a second set of coagulation simulations , which we started with the same total planetesimal mass but with an initial planetesimal size of 500  m in radius rather than 1  km .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows that the shape of the size distribution does not depend on the initial planetesimal size .",
    "this result remains valid as long as the initial planetesimal size is large enough such that the planetesimal collision timescale exceeds the kbo growth timescale .",
    "[ htp ]    these results confirm earlier findings by @xcite , who note that the power - law slope for large objects is remarkably independent of the input parameters and initial conditions .",
    "our work offers an explanation of why this is so .",
    "since the size distribution of large kbos reaches an equilibrium state that evolves self - similarly , the signature of the initial planetesimal size - distribution and their initial velocity dispersion are erased .",
    "the slope of the kbo size distribution and the formation timescales that we find in our simulations for large kbos is in agreement with results from previous coagulation simulations @xcite .      since our analytic result for the mass ratio between large and small kbos ( i.e. , @xmath46 )",
    "can be expressed as a function of @xmath3 alone , we performed an additional set of coagulation simulations for a value of @xmath3 that was decreased by a factor of 100 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the coagulation results for @xmath127 ( dashed lines ) , which is roughly the value for the kuiper belt , and @xmath128 ( solid lines ) .",
    "we increased the initial planetesimal mass in the @xmath129 simulation by a factor of @xmath130 to speed up the planetesimal growth . due to this mass increase",
    ", the resulting mass per logarithmic mass interval in large bodies should be the same in both simulations .",
    "this is indeed what we see in figure [ fig6 ] , confirming our analytic expression for @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows also that the equilibrium growth state , where growth by accretion of small bodies is comparable to the growth due to similar sized mergers , is reached later for @xmath128 compared to @xmath127 .",
    "we confirmed that this is not caused by the increased planetesimal mass that was used in the @xmath129 simulation .",
    "we have so far neglected collisions among the small bodies . in this section ,",
    "we first derive the planetesimal - planetesimal collision timescale and show that planetesimal collisions can be neglected during the kbo growth for planetesimal sizes of about a kilometer and larger .",
    "we then discuss how our results would be altered , if planetesimal collisions had been important during the kbo growth .",
    "in addition , we examine the effect of semi - collisional accretion @xcite and frequent binary mergers on the growth of kbos .",
    "the planetesimal - planetesimal collision time for objects with radius , @xmath131 , and with a velocity dispersion that has been excited above their escape velocity is given by @xmath132 comparing equation ( [ ec1 ] ) to the pluto formation timescale , which is given by the inverse of equation ( [ e5 ] ) we find that @xmath133 which is @xmath134 for 1-km - sized planetesimals and @xmath135 .",
    "1-km is about the size that planetesimals are expected to have , if they formed by gravitational instability without dissipation of internal angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this implies that if kbos grew from a population of 1-km sized planetesimals then mutual planetesimal collisions become important only once kbos comparable to the size of pluto have formed .",
    "if planetesimal - planetesimal collisions are important , then they would , most likely , break - up the planetesimals and lead to a damping of the small bodies velocity dispersion , which would therefore no longer grow as @xmath6 , as we assumed in section [ s1 ] .",
    "instead , it would be set by balancing the dynamical stirring from large bodies by collisional cooling .",
    "this yields @xmath136 for @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the radius of the small bodies @xcite .",
    "we note here that @xmath137 is most likely the relevant case to consider , since @xmath19 is only slightly super - hill when collisional cooling is neglected ( see section [ s1 ] ) . in this case , the growth of kbos is given by @xmath139 where we assumed that @xmath140 . substituting for @xmath19 from equation ( [ ce1 ] ) and comparing the two growth rates in equation ( [ ce2 ] ) , we find that the two growth rates become equal when @xmath141 this implies , that in this case , the growth of large bodies is dominated by the accretion of small bodies until more mass is converted into @xmath2 , compared to the case without frequent planetesimal collisions .",
    "the total mass in large kbos and the slope of their size distribution are therefore likely to be different from our results in section [ s1 ] and [ s2 ] , if collisions were important",
    ". the kbo growth would be halted , if collisions lead to the onset of a collisional cascade and if the small collisional fragments are efficiently lost from the kuiper belt .",
    "so far , we have treated the planetesimal accretion as collisionless , meaning that collisions among planetesimals can be neglected while they are inside the hill sphere of a growing kbo .",
    "this assumption is valid , if kbos formed from km - sized planetesimals .",
    "however , if planetesimals are of the order of a meter in size or smaller , either because they formed small , or because they were broken into small pieces , then they are more likely to collide with each other inside a kbo s hill sphere than to accrete onto the growing kbo directly @xcite .",
    "we call this semi - collisional accretion . such planetesimal collisions inside the hill sphere lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the kbos .",
    "if kbos grew by semi - collisional accretion than their growth could have been very fast , because the effective radius for accretion , in this case , is of the order of their hill sphere .",
    "the kbo growth would be dominated by the accretion of small planetesimals for much longer in the semi - collisional regime , compared to the growth scenario discussed and investigated in sections [ s1 ] and [ s2 ] .",
    "finally , the growth of kbos might also have been aided by merging comparable mass kuiper belt binaries .",
    "as we discuss in section [ sec - binaries ] in detail , a significant fraction of kbos reside in comparable mass binary systems and such systems likely formed by dynamical processes such as by three body capture , or by binary formation aided by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "once formed , the mutual semi - major axis of such binary systems starts to shrink due to dynamical friction generated by the small planetesimals @xcite .",
    "this eventually leads to merging between the binary components .",
    "this channel of growth could be important , because the binary formation time and the time it take for a binary to spiral in until contact occurs are comparable to the timescale on which large kbos grow @xcite . if merging of binary components is important in the overall kbo growth then the growth rate would be enhanced compared to equation ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "this results in a reduced mass surface density for large kbos , but the power - law slope of the large kbo size distribution will remain unchanged .",
    "our coagulation results also have interesting implications for the formation of kuiper belt binaries . a significant fraction of kbos are part of a binary system .",
    "the binary fraction varies for different dynamical classes and it is highest in the cold classical belt @xcite , where it is about 30% .",
    "more than 70 binaries have been discovered in the kuiper belt to date and their number continues to rise .",
    "high - mass ratio binary systems , including pluto / charon , likely formed in a collision and subsequent tidal evolution . however , the majority of kuiper belt binaries consist of comparable mass companions with wide separations and have too much angular momenta to have formed by the same mechanism .",
    "instead these systems most likely have a dynamical origin like , for example , binary formation by three body capture , or binary formation aided by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "the hill sphere , the region interior to an object s hill radius , sets the maximum phase space available for binary formation by such dynamical processes .",
    "dynamical binary formation scenarios take advantage of the increased size of the hill radius , which is more than an order of magnitude larger in the kuiper belt than for similar sized objects in the asteroid belt and therefore make the kuiper belt the ideal place for the formation of wide , comparable mass binaries .",
    "dynamical binary formation scenarios require @xmath63 for efficient formation , since binary formation rates quickly exceed the age of the solar system , once the velocity dispersion significantly exceeds the hill velocity @xcite .",
    "since kbo growth and binary formation occurs concurrently , we can predict the maximum mass ratio for such binary systems because we know the range of kbo radii that have sub - hill velocities at any given stage during the growth . from equation ( [ e10 ] ) we have @xmath63 for kbos with radii greater than @xmath75 .",
    "this implies a maximum mass ratio of @xmath142 between the primary and secondary and translates into a maximum magnitude difference between the binary components , assuming similar albedo , of about @xmath143 .",
    "this provides an explanation for the strong clustering in @xmath144 of binaries in the cold classical belt .",
    "this clustering was first pointed out by @xcite and is shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows that all binaries in the cold classical belt have @xmath145 , i.e. they lie in the region enclosed by the solid red lines .",
    "our coagulation work therefore suggests that the observed binaries in the classical belt formed by dynamical processes during the growth of the kbos themselves and that this formation most likely took place in situ .",
    "the cold classical belt is therefore not only distinct in its inclination distribution @xcite , color @xcite and binary fraction @xcite , but also in terms of the type of its binaries , i.e. they are exclusively comparable mass ratio binaries with @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows that , in contrast to the cold classical population , other dynamical classes have binaries with a wide range of mass ratios and they therefore most likely contain dynamically and collisionally formed binary systems . the fact that the other dynamical classes have comparable mass binaries as well as systems with a wider range of component sizes is consistent with the idea that they are a superposition of two original populations , namely a dynamical cold ( low inclination ) population that formed close to its current location and a dynamical hot ( high inclination ) population that formed closer to the sun .",
    "kuiper belt binaries may therefore prove to be useful probes for entangling the two original dynamical populations , if they existed ( murray - clay & schlichting 2010 , submitted ) .",
    "we carried out an analytic and numerical investigation of runaway growth of protoplanets with a focus on the kuiper belt .",
    "since , the kuiper belt is a remnant of the primordial solar system where planet formation never reached completion , it contains some of the least processed bodies . as a result",
    ", it provides a snapshot of earlier stages of planet formation , which were erased elsewhere in the solar system where planet formation proceeded to completion .",
    "our results for runaway growth , which we summarize below , therefore , do not only apply to the kuiper belt but also to planet formation before the onset of oligarchic growth .",
    "in addition , our findings apply to proto planetary growth in debris disks around other stars , as long as the protoplanets growth time is shorter than the planetesimal - planetesimal collision time , such that dynamical cooling and possible mass loss due to frequent planetesimal collisions can be neglected .    in this paper",
    ", we presented analytic work that describes the growth of kbos , the evolution of their velocity dispersion , and that provides insights into the underlying physical processes that give rise to the kbo size distribution .",
    "our work successfully explains the observed slope of the kbo size distribution as well as the total mass that is present in large kbos today .",
    "in addition it predicts the maximum mass - ratio of kuiper belt binaries that formed by dynamical processes , which explains the observed clustering in binary companion sizes that is seen in the cold classic belt .",
    "we confirmed our analytic results with numerical coagulation simulations .",
    "we find that the kbo growth proceeds as follows .",
    "initially all the mass resides in small planetesimals and large kbos start to form by accreting small planetesimals .",
    "this growth continues until growth by merging with comparable sized kbos become comparable to growth by accreting small bodies .",
    "we show that this condition sets in when @xmath147 . from that time",
    "onwards , the growth and the evolution of the velocity dispersion become self - similar and @xmath2 remains roughly constant , since the increase in @xmath2 by the accretion of small planetesimals is balanced by a decease due to the accretion of large bodies .",
    "we showed that this mode of growth leads to a kbo size distribution with power - law index @xmath56 .",
    "this is in good agreement with observations of the kuiper belt size distribution , which is well described by a power - law with an index that is consistent with @xmath56 within @xmath148 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a single albedo is assumed for all sizes when converting from the observed magnitude distribution to the kbo size distribution .",
    "therefore , possible albedo variations as a function of size could introduce a significant uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "the best fit value for the power - law index is typically found to somewhat exceed @xmath56 .",
    "we note that this could be due to fitting the high end of the size distribution that corresponds to the largest kbos , which is somewhat steeper than the rest of the distribution ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this steeper end of the kbo size distribution is due to the fact that the largest objects did not have enough time to grow to their steady - state abundance .    if kbos formed by coagulation from km - sized planetesimals , then there could not have been significantly more mass in large kbos than what is observed today , unless the mmsn was initially enhanced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the current mass in large kbos , since it is about @xmath149 of the mmsn that was enhanced by a factor of a few , as required for the formation of uranus and neptune .",
    "the observed mass in large kbos and their size distribution therefore support the hypothesis that kbos formed from a mmsn type disk by coagulation from kilometer sized planetesimals .",
    "the growth of kbos ended in this runaway phase with @xmath150 . in the context of planet formation",
    "this phase of runaway growth was terminated by the onset of oligarchic growth when each large body dominates the stirring in its own feeding zone . during oligarchic growth @xmath2",
    "continues to grow until it becomes comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "our understanding of the growth , the value of @xmath18 and the size distribution of large bodies differs from previous works that investigated the details of runaway growth @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that these works did not take into account the simultaneous evolution of the velocity dispersion during the growth but assumed either equipartition between the different mass bins @xcite and/or a constant velocity dispersion for all sizes @xcite .    since efficient binary formation by dynamical processes can only proceed among kbos that have sub - hill velocity dispersions @xcite and because we follow the evolution of the kbo velocity dispersion as well as their growth",
    ", we can predict the maximum mass ratio for such binary systems .",
    "our work yields a maximum binary mass ratio of @xmath151 , or , in other words , a maximum magnitude difference between binary components , assuming similar albedos , of @xmath143 .",
    "this explains the clustering in @xmath144 of all the observed kuiper belt binaries that are part of the cold classic belt , which make up about half of all known binary systems in the kuiper belt .",
    "there exists some tentative observational evidence that the power - law size distribution might be different for kbos with inclinations greater and smaller than @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found no conclusive evidence supporting such a difference .",
    "it will be interesting to see the results of future kbo surveys that address this question .",
