    "human pose estimation from video sequences has been an active field of research over the past decades and has various applications such as surveillance , medical diagnostics or human - computer interfaces @xcite .",
    "a branch of human pose estimation is referred to as _ articulated motion parsing _ @xcite . articulated motion parsing defines the combination of monocular pose estimation and motion tracking in uncontrolled environments .",
    "this work presents a new approach to temporally coherent human shape and motion estimation in uncontrolled monocular video sequences .",
    "in contrast to earlier work , our work follows the _ generative _ strategy , where both pose and shape parameters of a 3d body model are found to match the input image through analysis - by - synthesis @xcite . for analysis of human motion , a 2d or 3d skeleton representation is often sufficient . on the other hand",
    "actual 3d geometry enables additional application scenarios . especially image - based rendering applications can benefit from accurate 3d reconstruction .",
    "examples are augmentation of an actor s garment @xcite , texture augmentation @xcite , scene - space video processing @xcite or character deformation @xcite",
    ". further applications can be found in virtual and augmented reality applications @xcite .",
    "the 3d pose of a human figure is highly ambiguous when inferred from only a 2d image .",
    "human silhouettes can often be explained by two or more poses @xcite . in this work",
    "we aim to limit the number of possible solutions by taking the projected movement of the body , namely optical flow , into account .",
    "besides the motion of individual body parts , optical flow contains information about boundaries of rigid structures .",
    "additionally optical flow is an abstraction layer to the input modality .",
    "unique appearance effects such as texture and shading are removed @xcite .",
    "these features make optical flow highly suitable for generative optimization problems .",
    "0.33        0.33        0.33     existing methods for generative 3d human motion estimation from monocular video find a pose per frame independently .",
    "these poses are not necessarily related and can result in significant jumps in position and joint angles between two successive frames .",
    "our work aims for a more global solution to the problem , that ensures that the estimated poses are temporal coherent and therefore form fluent human motion .",
    "one of the key contributions of this work is the formulation of an artificial flow renderer that is used in the optimization process .",
    "the renderer calculates pixel displacement between the current scene and a previous time step .",
    "having a flow renderer available , human motion estimation can be formulated as an analysis - by - synthesis problem .",
    "the main idea of this work is that the current pose of a subject is well predetermined by the pose of the last frame and the optical flow between the last and current frame .",
    "following this idea , we search for those model parameters that create the highest similarity between observed and rendered flow for the two input frames . high temporal consistency between the reconstructed poses",
    "is achieved by initializing the current pose based on a kalman filter prediction and optimization on the optical flow to the last pose .",
    "we evaluate the proposed method using two well known datasets .",
    "we show the temporal consistency of our approach qualitatively and evaluate its 3d and 2d precision quantitatively . in the first test , we compare 3d joint positions against ground truth of the humaneva - i dataset @xcite and results of two recently published methods @xcite . the second evaluation compares projected 2d joint positions against ground truth of the videopose 2.0 dataset @xcite featuring camera movement and rapid gesticulation .",
    "we compare our results against a recent method for joint localization @xcite .",
    "results demonstrate the strengths and potential of the proposed method .",
    "human pose estimation is a broad and active field of research .",
    "we focus on 3d model - based approaches and previous work that exploits optical flow during pose estimation .    *",
    "human pose from images . * 3d human pose estimation is often based on the use of a body model .",
    "human body representations exist in 2d and 3d .",
    "many of the following methods utilize the 3d human body model scape @xcite .",
    "scape is a deformable mesh model learned from body scans .",
    "pose and shape of the model are parametrized by a set of body part rotations and low dimensional shape deformations . in recent work the smpl model ,",
    "a more accurate blend shape model compatible with existing rendering engines , has been presented by loper @xcite .",
    "a variety of approaches to 3d pose estimation have been presented using various cues including shape from shading , silhouettes and edges . due to the highly ill - posed and under - constrained nature of the problem",
    "these methods often require user interaction e.g.  through manual annotation of body joints on the image @xcite .",
    "guan @xcite have been the first to present a detailed method to recover human pose together with an accurate shape estimate from single images . based on manual initialization",
    ", parameters of the scape model are optimized exploiting edge overlap and shading .",
    "the work is based on @xcite , a method that recovers the 3d pose from silhouettes from 3 - 4 calibrated cameras .",
    "similar methods have been presented by blan @xcite and sigal @xcite , also requiring multi - view input .",
    "hasler @xcite fit a statistical body model @xcite into monocular image silhouettes .",
    "a similar approach is followed by chen @xcite . in recent work ,",
    "@xcite present the first method to extract both pose and shape from a single image fully automatically .",
    "2d joint locations are found using the cnn - based approach deepcut @xcite , then projected joints of the smpl model are fitted against the 2d locations .",
    "the presented method is similar to ours as it also relies on 2d features .",
    "in contrast to our work no consistency with the image silhouette or temporal coherency is guaranteed .",
    "* pose reconstruction for image based rendering .",

    "* optical flow based methods . *",
    "different works have been presented exploiting optical flow for different purposes .",
    "sapp @xcite and fragkiadaki @xcite use optical flow for segmentation as a preliminary step for pose estimation .",
    "both exploit the rigid structure revealing property of optical flow , rather than information about motion .",
    "fablet and black @xcite use optical flow to learn motion models for automatic detection of human motion .",
    "@xcite categorize human motion viewed from a distance by building an optical flow - based motion descriptor .",
    "both methods label motion without revealing the underlying movement pattern .    in recent work , romero @xcite present a method for 2d human pose estimation using optical flow only .",
    "they detect body parts by porting the random forest approach used by the microsoft kinect to use optical flow .",
    "brox @xcite have shown that optical flow can be used for 3d pose tracking of rigid objects .",
    "they propose the use for objects _ modeled as kinematic chains_. they argue that optical flow provides point correspondences inside the object contour which can help to identify a pose where silhouettes are ambiguous .",
    "inspired by the above mentioned characteristics , this paper investigates as to what extent optical flow can be used for 3d human motion estimation from monocular video .",
    "optical flow @xcite is the perception of motion by our visual sense . for two successive video frames ,",
    "it is described as a 2d vector field that matches a point in the first frame to the displaced point in the following frame @xcite .",
    "although calculated in the image plane , optical flow contains 3d information , as it can be interpreted as the projection of 3d scene flow @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "optical flow is , by definition , not independent of lighting changes and highly dependent on high - contrast edges . in this work",
    "we assume that all observed surfaces are diffuse , opaque and textured . under this assumption ,",
    "the entire observed optical flow is caused by relative movement between object and camera .",
    "the presented method estimates pose parameters and position of a human model frame by frame .",
    "the procedure requires a single initialization step and then runs automatically .",
    "the parameters for each frame are found by moving the human model along the optical flow field between the current frame and the subsequent frames .",
    "a set of regularization functions is defined to keep the accumulated error over time to a minimum to make the method robust .",
    "the modular structure of the presented method allows for further optimization .    in the following",
    "we elaborate on the used methods and objectives . afterwards",
    "the initialization and optimization procedures are described .      in this work",
    ", we use the human body model smpl @xcite .",
    "the model can be reshaped using 10 shape parameters @xmath0 . for different poses ,",
    "72 pose parameters @xmath1 can be set , including global orientation . @xmath0 and @xmath1 produce realistic vertex transformations and cover a large range of body shapes and poses .",
    "we define @xmath2 as the model state at time step @xmath3 , with global translation vector @xmath4 and gender @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the camera position and rotation as well as its focal length are known and static .",
    "it is however not required that the camera of the actual scene is fixed , as the body model can rotate and move around the camera .",
    "the core of the presented method is our differential flow renderer built upon opendr @xcite , a powerful open source framework for analysis - by - synthesis .",
    "the rendered flow image depends on the vertex locations determined by the virtual human model s pose parameters @xmath1 and its translation @xmath4 . to be able to render the flow _ in situ _ , we calculate the flow from frame @xmath3 to @xmath6 , referred as backward flow . with this approach each pixel , and more importantly , each vertex location contains the information where it came from rather than were it went and can be rendered in place .",
    "the calculation of the flow is achieved as follows : the first step calculates the displacement of all vertices between two frames @xmath3 and @xmath7 in the image plane .",
    "then the flow per pixel is calculated through barycentric interpolation of the neighboring vertices .",
    "visibility and barycentric coordinates are calculated through the standard opengl rendering pipeline .",
    "the core feature of the utilized rendering framework opendr is the differentiability of the rendering pipeline . to benefit from that property , our renderer estimates the partial derivatives of each flow vector with respect to each projected vertex position .    0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2       having a flow renderer available",
    ", we can formulate the pose estimation as an optimization problem .",
    "the cost function @xmath8 over all pixels @xmath9 is defined as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 refers to the _ rendered _ and @xmath12 to the _ observed _ flow field calculated on the input frames @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "the objective drives the optimization in such way that the rendered flow is similar to the observed flow ( fig . [",
    "fig : observedvsoptimized ] ) .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , we evaluate @xmath8 not over the flow field but over its gaussian pyramid in order to perform a more global search .    for this work we use the method by xu @xcite to calculate the observed optical flow field .",
    "the method has its strength in the ability to calculate large displacements while at the same time preserving motion details and handling occlusions .",
    "the definition of the objective shows that the performance of the optical flow estimation is crucial to the overall performance of the presented method . to compensate for inaccuracies of the flow estimation and to lower the accumulated error over time ,",
    "we do not rely exclusively on the flow for pose estimation , but employ regularization as well .",
    "smpl does not define bounds for deformation .",
    "we introduce soft boundaries to constrain the joint angles in form of a cost function for pose estimation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are empirical lower and upper boundaries and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are applied component - wise .",
    "furthermore , we introduce extended kalman filtering per joint and linear kalman filtering for translation .",
    "besides for temporal smoothness the kalman filters are used to predict an _ a priori _ pose for the next frame before optimization .    during optimization the extremities of the model may intersect with other body parts . to prevent this",
    ", we integrate the interpenetration error term @xmath18 from @xcite .",
    "the error term is defined over a capsule approximation of the body model . by using an error term interpenetration",
    "is not strictly prohibited but penalized .",
    "pose estimation based on flow similarity requires that the rendered human model accurately covers the subject in the input image . only body parts that cover the correct counterpart in the image",
    "can be moved correctly based on flow . to address inaccuracies caused by flow calculation , we introduce boundary matching .",
    "we use the method presented by blan @xcite and adapt it to achieve differentiability .",
    "a cost function measures how well the model fits the image silhouette @xmath19 by penalizing non - overlapping pixels by the shortest distance to the model silhouette @xmath20 . for this purpose chamfer distance maps @xmath21 for the image silhouette and @xmath22 for the model are calculated .",
    "the cost function is defined as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 weighs @xmath25 stronger as image silhouettes are wider so that it is more important for the model to reside within in the image silhouette than to completely cover it .",
    "to achieve differentiability we approximate @xmath22 by calculating the shortest distance of each pixel to the model capsule approximation .",
    "to lower computation time , we calculate only a grid of values and interpolate in between .      for the initialization of the presented method",
    "two manual steps are required .",
    "first the user sets the joints of the body model to a pose that roughly matches the observed pose .",
    "it is sufficient that only the main joints such as shoulder , elbow , hip and knee are manipulated . in a second step",
    "the user marks joint locations of hips , knees , ankles , shoulders , elbows and wrists in the first frame .",
    "if the position of a joint can not be seen or estimated it may be skipped . from this point no further user input is needed .",
    "the initialization is then performed in three steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] ) .",
    "the first step minimizes the distance between the marked joints and their model counterparts projected to the image plane , while keeping @xmath18 and @xmath26 low .",
    "we optimize over translation @xmath4 , pose @xmath1 and shape @xmath0 . to guide the process",
    "we regularize both @xmath1 and @xmath0 with objectives that penalize high differences to the manually set pose and the mean shape . in the second step",
    "we include the silhouette coverage objective @xmath27 . finally , we optimize the estimated pose for temporal consistency .",
    "we initialize the second frame with the intermediate initialization result and optimize on the flow field afterwards . while optimizing @xmath8 we still allow updates for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "after initialization we now iteratively find each pose using the defined objectives .",
    "each frame is initialized with the kalman prediction step .",
    "afterwards we minimize : @xmath30 with scalar weights @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 regularizes the current pose with respect to the last pose .",

    "in contrast to the methods of bogo . @xcite and wandt @xcite , our method does not require prior knowledge about the performed motion or a trained pose prior .",
    "we explain the performance with the fact , that each frame is well pre - initialized by its predecessor and a robust kalman prediction .",
