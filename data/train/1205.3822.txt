    "nowadays it is well established that the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions describes very well almost every subatomic phenomenon up to order of @xmath4 100 gev @xcite . however , there is a lot of experimental results that are not well understood or nor embedded in their predictions . among the many attempts to generalize the sm ,",
    "several of them involve extensions of the higgs sector .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , those extensions that add scalar triplet to the higgs sector and left - right symmetry models end up with physical doubly charged higgs bosons ( dchbs ) in its particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "the dchbs ( @xmath5 ) have some interesting consequences .",
    "the main one is related to the seesaw mechanism , which is capable of generating a small mass for the neutrino .",
    "these models are manifested in the higher energy range and the scheme is constructed so that the neutrino mass is inversely proportional to this new energy scale .",
    "this relationship can provide an idea of why the neutrino mass is so small compared with fermi scale @xcite .",
    "one of the major motivations for the study of these particles with double charge comes from the fact that experimental physicists expect to find this kind of particles at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , ilc and clic .",
    "the fermilab tevatron can detect dchbs via pair production if its mass does not exceed @xmath6 gev an at the lhc this limit rises up to @xmath7 gev . at the tevatron ,",
    "an attempt to directly detect dchbs were carried out based on the channel @xmath8 looking for decay mode @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are known charged leptons .",
    "four - lepton final states was observed by d@xmath11 collaboration @xcite , while in cdf was observed @xmath12 , @xmath13 and states involving @xmath14 leptons @xcite .",
    "these searches were done for left - right model .",
    "then , assuming a br@xmath15 , left ( right ) chiral dchbs with masses larger than 150 ( 136 ) gev and 127 ( 113 ) gev , respectively , are excluded @xcite .",
    "in this paper we work under the 3 - 3 - 1 electroweak model @xcite . in this class of models the electroweak symmetry gauge group su(2)@xmath16@xmath17u(1 ) of the sm",

    "the simplest version of scalar sector of the model has only three higgs triplets @xcite .",
    "consequently , this model predicts the existence of eight physical higgs bosons which are four neutral bosons @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , a pair of single charged bosons @xmath23 , and a pair of dchbs .",
    "it loses the perturbative character on a scale of a few tev , so that , we can admit that this is the upper limit of energy for the model under consideration @xcite .",
    "this class of models is one of the most interesting alternatives to the sm .",
    "the process of cancellation of anomalies requires that the number of families be an integer multiple of the number of colors .",
    "but , since qcd requires that the number of colors is less than five , then in the 3 - 3 - 1 model the number of families is exactly three @xcite .",
