    "the _ kepler _ satellite , launched in march 2009 , is nasa s first mission capable of finding earth - size and smaller planets @xcite .",
    "it has an 0.95-m aperture schmidt telescope with a photometer comprised of 42 ccds having a fixed field of view of 105 square degrees in the constellations cygnus and lyrae .",
    "it is designed to monitor continuously the brightness of @xmath0 stars during the first year , reduced to @xmath1 stars later in the mission .",
    "this results in high - quality light curves , not only interesting for the detection of planets , but also of great importance for asteroseismology .    in this letter , we present data from the asteroseismology program of the _ nasa kepler mission _ @xcite .",
    "we present a search for variable stars and the application of supervised classification methods to the _ kepler _ long - cadence q1 data of its asteroseismology program , covering 33.5 days in total .",
    "all the light curves have 29.4-min time sampling .",
    "both the total time span and sampling are very well suited to study short period eclipsing and ellipsoidal binaries , classical pulsators such as rrlyr stars and cepheids , and nonradial pulsators such as @xmath2cep stars , slowly pulsating b stars ( spbs ) , @xmath3sct stars and @xmath4dor stars ( see @xcite for a definition of all these classes ) .",
    "we used the stellar fluxes as they were delivered to us after preliminary data processing @xcite . in total , we analyzed 2288 _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "we compare our results to a pre - launch classification based on data in the _ kepler input catalog _",
    "( _ kic _ hereafter ) and prepared by the _ kepler asteroseismic science consortium _ ( kasc , gilliland et al .",
    "finally , we compare the point - to - point scatter of the _ kepler _ data to the one of corot s exoplanet data of the first long run ( 5 months ) of that mission .",
    "to detect and extract the variables , we relied on the automated variability characterization method as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this method searches for three independent frequencies for every star , which are used to make a harmonic best - fit to the trend - subtracted time series . in this way",
    "we obtain a homogeneous set of parameters for each star , irrespective of its variability nature .",
    "the goal is _ not _ to achieve a good light curve model , but rather to deduce a set of light curve parameters which is sufficient to classify the variability .    using this set of parameters , we classified the stars using a modified version of the classifier based on gaussian mixtures , described in @xcite , with the definition stars from @xcite .",
    "we improved the performance of the algorithm presented in @xcite by classifying the objects using a multi - stage tree .",
    "in each node , we decide which groups of stars we want to distinguish .",
    "the best parameters are then selected for that node and for each group the parameter distribution is approximated with a mixture of multi - dimensional gaussians . to each variable stellar target",
    "we assign a probability that it belongs to a particular group .    in order to obtain the final probability for each variability class",
    "we multiply the probabilities along the corresponding root - to - leaf path ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a general introduction and definition of tree - structured classifiers ) . in practice , this works as follows for our application : the probability of a stellar target being an rrlyr star of type ab is , e.g. , the probability of not being an eclipsing binary ( first stage ) times the probability of belonging to the rrlyr group ( second stage ) times the probability of being an rrlyr star of type ab .",
    "this procedure was followed to compute class probabilities for each target . in order to obtain the best candidates",
    ", we additionally used the mahalanobis distance , which is a multi - dimensional generalization of the one - dimensional statistical or standard distance as described in @xcite .",
    "a visual check has been performed as well .",
    "the variability classes we currently take into account , and the number of good candidate class members , are listed in table[classes ] . while we classified more than 200 stars securely",
    ", the majority of targets still has a too ambiguous class assignment , mainly due to the limited time base and to the large fraction of red giants among the sample ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , we managed to identify numerous new pulsators and binaries from the short time series and from early data reduction .",
    "all the illustrations presented in this paper contain stars that were either unknown as variables or were misclassified prior to launch .",
    "we evaluated our classification results by visual inspection and manual analysis of the best candidates based on the mahalanobis distance , and by comparing them with the pre - launch classification which is often insecure due to limited ground data .",
    "the results are summarized in table[classes ] . in the second and third column ,",
    "a mahalanobis distance smaller than 3 and 2 is taken , respectively , without visual inspection . in the fourth column",
    "the final numbers of candidates are given , taking a mahalanobis distance less than 3 and performing an additional visual inspection .",
    "in the last column , the pre - launch classification done by kasc members is given .",
    "note that several targets occur in more than one pre - launch class .",
    "for the majority of the classes in table[classes ] , our results appreciably improve the pre - launch results , which were necessarily based on ground - based data and could not take into account _",
    "s high quality light curves .",
    "good agreement is obtained for binaries and classical pulsators such as rrlyr stars and cepheids , but even there , we are able to improve the pre - launch results as some rr lyr candidates were reclassified by us as eclipsing binaries .",
    "one example is given in the third panel of fig.[lc_ecl ] .",
    "we could also identify many new ( eclipsing ) binaries , some of which are shown in fig.[lc_ecl ] .",
    "an example of a red giant pulsator with solar - like oscillations in an eclipsing binary is discussed in detail in @xcite .    for main - sequence nonradial pulsators , such as @xmath5 cep , @xmath3 sct , spb and @xmath6 dor stars",
    ", there is much discrepancy between the pre - launch and our classification .",
    "few of the pre - launch candidates turn out to be actual class members .",
    "indeed , we do not find high - probability candidates among these stars with a pre - launch class assignment .",
    "on the other hand , we identified new nonradial pulsators not present in the pre - launch lists .",
    "some examples are shown in fig.[lc_multivar ] .",
    "similar light curves , albeit for fainter stars , were found in the corot exoplanet database ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) .",
    "we have not yet been able to compare our results for the long period variables along or past the asymptotic giant branch , such as miras or rvtau stars , since the current total time span of the light curves is only a fraction of the typical pulsation periods of those objects . moreover , we did not yet search for short - period pulsators , such as solar - like pulsators along the main sequence , rapidly oscillating ap stars , subdwarf ob variables and white dwarf pulsators ( see @xcite for class definitions ) , given that we do not yet have short - cadence data .",
    "another point of attention is the classification of solar - like pulsators .",
    "stochastic pulsations are more easily recognized from a broad power excess than from the methodology adopted here .",
    "indeed , the automated selection of the three highest frequency peaks will almost always be peaks due to granulation and/or background noise .",
    "thus , to find such pulsators , one better uses an extractor - type approach .",
    "this involves fitting and subtraction of the granulation and background signal to characterize the type of star , after which the oscillations can be sought .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a study of solar - like pulsators among _ kepler _ targets .",
    "finally , we stress that our classifiers solely use the information contained in the _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "this implies that we can not discriminate well between the class pairs of b - type @xmath5 cep and a - type @xmath3 sct stars with periodicities of the order of hours , and b - type spb versus f - type @xmath6 dor stars with oscillation periods of days .",
    "both pairs of classes contain light curves with very similar characteristics .",
    "to discriminate between them , at least some spectral information , such as a properly dereddened b - v color index or a stellar spectrum , is needed . according to the initial mass function ,",
    "most of these candidates should be af - type pulsators .",

    "figure[ptp ] reveals the point - to - point scatter in the _ kepler _ data of its asteroseismology program as described in @xcite , as well as a comparison with that for the corot space mission s exoplanet data for its first long run of 5 months @xcite .",
    "we rescaled the corot data to the same integration time of 29.4min as for the long - cadence mode of _ kepler _ in order to ensure an appropriate comparison .",
    "duty cycles of these corot and _ kepler _ data are some 90% and 99% , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the _ kepler _ data with still preliminary processing @xcite already outperforms the corot exoplanet data by a factor @xmath82 for objects with a visual magnitude of around 14 to a factor of @xmath82.3 for objects of magnitude around 16 .",
    "this is more or less as expected based on the difference in aperture size of the two instruments .",
    "importantly for follow - up studies of the most interesting variable stars , the _ kepler _ asteroseismology sample focuses on brighter objects .",
    "typical noise levels of the least variable stars in the _ kepler _ asteroseismology program , estimated as the average amplitude in the fourier transform avoiding the low - frequency regime below 1 cycle per day , range from 1.3 @xmath9mag for an 8th magnitude star to 34 @xmath9mag for a 16th magnitude star",
    ". more than 70% of the kasc stars are variable in one way or another , even taking into account residual instrumental effects .",
    "note that this is a much higher fraction than for the corot exoplanet programme , because the kasc target selection was aimed at focusing on variable stars while the corot exoplanet sample is unbiased with respect to variability .",
    "we presented the first results of the application of automated supervised classification methods to 2288 _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "comparison with existing pre - launch classification and manual classification of the light curves shows the capabilities of our methodology : we are able to improve the pre - existing classification results seriously , and to identify new class members , unknown prior to launch .",
    "we will repeat the classifications as more and longer time - span light curves become available .",
    "this way , we will also be able to identify variables with longer periodicities and have much better capacity to unravel beat periods in multiperiodic pulsators .",
    "more classes will be included in the classification scheme , and , even more importantly , the class definition stars will be updated using the high quality _ kepler _ light curves themselves .",
    "access to 1-min cadence data will allow us to classify shorter period variables , in additional to those presented here . with each new set of data ,",
    "our results will be updated and made available .",
    "we gratefully thank the entire _ kepler _ team , whose excellent efforts have made these results possible .",
