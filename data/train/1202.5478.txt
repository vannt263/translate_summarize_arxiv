    "there have been recently a great deal of interest in generalization of the leavitt path algebras associated to directed graphs @xcite . given a row - finite graph @xmath0 and a field @xmath3 , in @xcite leavitt path algebra @xmath4",
    "was defined by an algebraic analogue of the definition of graph @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 described in @xcite .",
    "after that in @xcite this definition was extended for every countable graph @xmath0 .",
    "the algebras @xmath4 are generalizations of the algebras @xmath7 , @xmath8 , investigated by leavitt @xcite , and are a specific type of path @xmath3-algebras associated to a graph ( modulo certain relations ) .",
    "this class of algebras is important for two reasons .",
    "first , some examples of many interesting classes of algebras can be seen as the leavitt path algebras of some specific graphs rather than the classical leavitt algebras @xmath7 , such as : ( 1 ) matrix rings @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 denotes @xmath12 matrices with only a finite number of nonzero entries ) , ( 2 ) the toeplitz algebra , and ( 3 ) the laurent polynomials ring @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "second , they are useful because structural properties of the algebras can be related to simple observations about their underlying graphs .",
    "concretely , the literature on leavitt path algebras includes necessary and sufficient conditions on a directed graph @xmath0 so that the corresponding leavitt path algebra @xmath4 is simple @xcite , purely infinite simple @xcite , finite dimensional @xcite , locally finite @xcite , and semisimple @xcite .",
    "recently , mark tomforde introduced leavitt path algebras @xmath14 with coefficients in a unital commutative ring @xmath1 @xcite and proved two well - known uniqueness theorems for this class of algebras ; namely , the graded uniqueness theorem and the cuntz - krieger uniqueness theorem .",
    "he then defined basic ideals , and in the case that @xmath0 is a row - finite graph , characterized graded basic ideals of @xmath14 by the saturated hereditary subsets of vertices in @xmath0 . for non - row finite graphs , the set of admissible pairs in @xmath0 are considered instead of saturated hereditary subsets of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in this case , basic ideals of @xmath14 are more complicated , and to determined a one - to - one correspondence between graded basic ideals of @xmath14 and admissible pairs in @xmath0 , we need to modify the definition of basic ideals .",
    "we give a new definition of basic ideal such that when @xmath0 is row - finite , it is equivalent to that in @xcite",
    ". then the ideal characterization of @xcite is developed for every countable graph .    in @xcite ,",
    "the primitive spectrum of a graph @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 was characterized . by inspiring the ideas of @xcite , aranda pino , pardo , and",
    "siles molina determined the prime spectrum and primitivity of a leavitt path algebras @xmath2 in @xcite when @xmath0 is row - finite and @xmath1 is a field .",
    "the knowledge of the prime and primitive leavitt path algebras is a fundamental and necessary step towards the classification of these algebras . in particular ,",
    "the prime spectrum for commutative rings is to carry information over from algebra to topology and vice versa . also , we know that the primitive ideals of a ring naturally correspond to its irreducible representations . in this paper , we determine prime and primitive leavitt path algebras by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the coefficients ring @xmath1 and the underlying graph @xmath0 .",
    "these results are a generalization of results in @xcite which were proved for the case that @xmath0 is row - finite and @xmath1 is a field .",
    "moreover , by applying these , we give graph theoretic descriptions of prime and primitive graded basic ideals of @xmath2 .    the present article is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by section 2 to provide some basic facts about leavitt path algebras .",
    "most of our definitions in this section are from @xcite . for a directed graph @xmath0 and a unital commutative ring @xmath1",
    ", it is associated an @xmath1-algebra @xmath14 .",
    "these algebras are defined as the definition of graph @xmath5-algebras @xmath6 and they have natural @xmath16-grading . in section 3 ,",
    "we study ideal structure of @xmath14 .",
    "our characterization are inspired by the structure of graded ideals of @xmath4 in @xcite , and graded basic ideals of @xmath14 in @xcite when @xmath0 is row - finite .",
    "we develop the ideal characterization of @xcite for non - row - finite cases . in spite of",
    "what claimed in @xcite , to do this we need to change the definition of basic ideal in @xcite so that graded basic ideals of @xmath14 are corresponding to admissible pairs in @xmath0 .",
    "however , our definition is equivalent to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 7.2 ) when underlying graph is row - finite .",
    "then graded basic ideals of @xmath14 are determined by admissible pairs in @xmath0 .    in section 4 ,",
    "we give two necessary and sufficient conditions for the primeness of a leavitt path algebra @xmath2 and then we apply this result to determine prime graded basic ideals .",
    "in particular , when @xmath1 is a field and @xmath0 satisfies condition ( k ) , our results determine the prime spectrum of @xmath2 . in section 5 , the minimal left ideals and the minimal right ideals of @xmath2 generated by a single vertex are characterized .",
    "we show that a left ideal @xmath17 is minimal in @xmath2 if and only if @xmath1 is a field and @xmath18 is a line point .",
    "this is a natural generalization of the results in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) which will be needed in section 6 .    finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we give two necessary and sufficient conditions for the left and right primitivity of @xmath2 as a ring .",
    "we then characterize primitive graded ideals of @xmath2 . in particular , when @xmath1 is a field and @xmath0 satisfies condition ( k ) , all primitive ideals of @xmath2 are characterized and we show that the set of primitive ideals and the set of prime ideals of @xmath2 coincide .",
    "in this section we provide the basic definitions and properties of leavitt path algebras which will be used in the next sections . for more thorough introduction , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
