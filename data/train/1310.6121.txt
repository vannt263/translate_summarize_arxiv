    "we are interested in a classical stochastic control problem whose value function is solution of the following hamilton jacobi equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 \\times { \\mathbf{r}}^d$ ] , @xmath2 is a complete metric space .",
    "@xmath3 is a @xmath4 matrix and so @xmath5 is a @xmath6 symmetric matrix , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 coefficients are functions defined on @xmath9 with values respectively in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "+ let s introduce an @xmath10-valued controled process @xmath12 defined on a filtered probability space @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a progressive process with values in @xmath2 .",
    "this kind of problem arise when you want to minimize a cost function @xmath16\\ ] ] with respect to the control @xmath17 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the optimal value @xmath18 is a viscosity solution of equation ( [ hjb ] ) .",
    "+ several approaches exist to solve this problem :    * the first approach is the generalized finite differences method developed by bonnans zidani @xcite where the derivatives are approximated taking some non directly adjacent points .",
    "directions are chosen such that the operator is consistent and it is monotone .",
    "barles souganidis framework @xcite can be used to prove that the scheme converges to the viscosity solution of the problem . *",
    "the second is the semi - lagrangian approach developed by camilli falcone for example @xcite , generalized by munos zidani @xcite and studied in detail by debrabant jakobsen @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the scheme is discretized in time with a step @xmath19 , the brownian motion is discretized taking two values of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "the scheme still follows the barles souganidis framework . *",
    "the third approach is based on monte carlo techniques and the resolution of a second order backward stochastic differential equation .",
    "initially developed by fahim , touzi , warin @xcite for two particular schemes , it has been generalized for degenerated hjb equations by tan @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution is still given by the barles souganidis framework .",
    "we will look at the use of semi - lagrangian schemes for solving the control problem ( [ hjb ] ) .",
    "these schemes have been studied in detail recently by debrabant and jakobsen @xcite but for a low degree interpolator ( typically linear ) that gives a monotone operator . under an assumption of cfl type , they show that the schemes are converging to the viscosity solution of the problem and using the method of shaking coefficients @xcite , they provide an estimate of the rate of convergence .",
    "finally , they develop a higher order scheme but without proof of convergence to the viscosity solution of the problem .",
    "+ in this note , we will look at non monotone approximations of higher degree .",
    "we show the convergence of such schemes to the viscosity solution of the problem and give an estimate of the error based on the fineness of the mesh .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is as follows : in the first part , we give the notations and some classical results of existence and uniqueness of the solution of ( [ hjb ] ) .",
    "after time discretization , we show for some general approximations the convergence of the discrete solution to the viscosity solution of the problem if we can solve the optimization problem obtained at each time step .",
    "we explain why the monotony is not necessary to obtain convergence toward the viscosity solution : a scheme converging under certain assumptions always converges to the viscosity solution . + in the second part we develop several lagrange interpolators , spline interpolators , and approximations based on bernstein polynomials converging .",
    "+ the last part , the techniques to properly treat the boundary conditions and parallelization methods are developed so that problems of dimension greater than 2 can be tackled .",
    "on different test cases , we show that the developed schemes are effective even in cases where the theory gives no evidence of convergence ( unbounded control ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the minimum and @xmath22 the maximum .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the euclidean norm of a vector . for a bounded function @xmath24 , we set @xmath25_1 = \\sup_{(s , x ) \\ne ( t , y ) } \\frac { |w(s , x ) -w(t , y)|}{|x - y| + |t - s|^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath26_1 $ ] .",

    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively sub and supersolution of equation ( [ hjb ] ) satisfying @xmath35 then @xmath36 .",
    "a spatial discretization length of the problem @xmath37 being given , thereafter @xmath38 with @xmath39 will correspond to the coordinates of a mesh @xmath40 defining a hyper - cube in dimension @xmath41 . for an interpolation grid @xmath42^n$ ] , and for a mesh @xmath43 , the point @xmath44 with @xmath45^d$ ] will have the coordinate @xmath46 .",
