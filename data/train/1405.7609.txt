    "like ordinary thermodynamic matter , black holes also have temperature , entropy and energy",
    ". the laws of black hole mechanics have the similar forms to the laws of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can treat black holes as thermodynamic systems .",
    "in fact , between black holes and the conventional thermodynamic systems , there are other similarities , such as phase transition and critical behaviors .",
    "the pioneering work of davies@xcite and the well - known hawking - page phase transition@xcite are both proposed to elaborate these points .",
    "the phase transitions and critical phenomena in anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes have been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "some interesting works show that there exists phase transition similar to the van der waals liquid / gas phase transition for some black holes@xcite . even for the black holes in ds space critical behaviors",
    "can also be studied by considering the connections between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon@xcite .",
    "recently , some physicists reconsidered the critical phenomena of ads black holes by treating the cosmological constant @xmath1 as a variable and connecting it with the thermodynamic pressure@xcite . in some models , the cosmological constant",
    "may be considered to be a time - variable quantity@xcite , or as some thermodynamic quantities , such as thermodynamic pressure@xcite , which should be a conjugate quantity of thermodynamic volume .",
    "inclusion of the variation of @xmath1 can make the first law of black hole thermodynamics consistent with the smarr formula for some black holes .    in this letter ,",
    "we study the critical behaviors of a kind black hole derived in asymptotic safety gravity .",
    "the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity was put forward by weinberg@xcite .",
    "it is based on a nontrivial fixed point of the underlying renormalization group(rg ) flow for gravity .",
    "this theory has been studied extensively and applied to several different subjects in quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "bonanno and reuter@xcite derived the renormalization group improved black hole metrics by replacing newtonian coupling constant with a  running \" one .",
    "cai , et.al @xcite find a spherically symmetric vacuum solution to field equation derived from the as gravity with higher derivative terms and with cosmological constant .",
    "in this theory , the cosmological constant is no longer constant but dependent on a momentum cutoff .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to include the variation of @xmath1 in the first law of black hole thermodynamics as thermodynamic pressure @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum correction of as gravity to the conventional schwarzschild - ads black hole makes its thermodynamic quantities and critical behaviors very different .",
    "the quantum - corrected black hole can also show a phase transition analogous to the liquid - gas phase transition in the van der waals system . according to ehrenfest",
    "s classification we also consider the gibbs free energy , the isothermal compressibility and the expansion coefficient .",
    "it is shown that the type of phase transition for the black hole at the critical point belongs to the second - order or continuous one .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in the next section we simply introduce the as gravity model and its quantum - corrected black hole solution . in section 3",
    "we will study the @xmath0 criticality by considering the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure .",
    "we also calculate the critical exponents here . in section 4",
    "we also analyze the type of the phase transition of the quantum - corrected black hole in the extended phase space according to ehrenfest s classification .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "we start with a generally covariant effective gravitational action with higher derivative terms involving a momentum cutoff @xmath3@xcite : _",

    "the couplings satisfy the rg equations : g_i(p)=_i[g(p ) ] assuming a static spherically symmetric metric ansatz and choosing the schwarzschild gauge ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+f(r)^-1dr^2+r^2d_2 ^2 , and then substituting it into the generalized einstein field equations ^=0 , one can derive a schwarzschild-(anti)-de sitter - like solution [ metric ] f(r)=1- , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the gravitational coupling and the radius of the asymptotically ( a)ds space , and both depend on the momentum cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there are a gaussian fixed point in the ir limit and a non - gaussian fixed point in the uv limit .",
    "a central result is & & g_0 - + & & g_1 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the values of the gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant in the ir limit which should be determined by astronomical observations . the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are both related to the running couplings @xmath16 at the non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 has the familiar logarithmic form which approaches asymptotic freedom ( p ) = , where @xmath18 is a fixed value of the coefficient @xmath17 at the planck scale , and @xmath19 is the planck mass .",
    "it is shown that the running gravitational coupling @xmath10 is related the newtonian gravitational coupling constant @xmath20 by g_p=. at high energy scale , p(r)2.663()^1/8r^-3/4 .",
    "thus , f(r)1-|_0|^1/4(mr)^1/2 which is singular - free at @xmath21 .",
    "however , the curvature singularity still exists due to divergent @xmath22 .    at low energy scale ,",
    "the momentum cutoff drop to the infrared(ir ) limit , and @xmath23 . at this time , [ metric1 ] f(r ) 1- where @xmath24 has been set for simplicity .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 represents the quantum correction to the conventional schwarzschild - ads black hole . obviously , when @xmath25 , the corrected metric will return back to the schwarzschild - ads one . below",
    "we will study the thermodynamics of the quantum - corrected black holes based on eq.([metric1 ] ) .",
    "it is shown that owing to the correction , the thermodynamic quantities will also be corrected .",
    "in this paper we only concern with the asymptotic ads black hole .",
    "firstly , we identify the pressure with p=. from eq.([metric1 ] ) , one can easily obtain the mass m= , where @xmath27 is the radius of the black hole event horizon .",
    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics should written as [ 1st ] dm = tds+vdp where the conjugate thermodynamic volume @xmath28 . here , the mass of black hole is no more internal energy , but should be interpreted as the thermodynamic enthalpy , namely @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics represented by the internal energy @xmath30 reads [ flenergy ] du = tds - pdv where @xmath31 .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole can be easily derived [ temp ] t== .",

    "there is a critical value of @xmath14 , below which there will be both local maximum and minimum for the temperature , and above which no local extremum exists . at the critical value ,",
    "the maximum and minimum will coincide . from fig.1(b ) , one can see that , when @xmath38 , @xmath39 suffers discontinuities at two points , which can be identified as the critical points for phase transition in the quantum - corrected black hole .",
    "the divergences of the heat capacity appear precisely at the extrema of the temperature .",
    "the small and large black holes with positive heat capacity can be stable . while the intermediate black hole with negative heat capacity is instable .    from eq.([temp ] ) , one can derive the equation of state of the black hole [ eos ] p= one can take the specific volume as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 counting the number of degrees of freedom associated with the black hole horizon@xcite . @xmath42 here is the planck length .",
    "if we take @xmath43 , the specific volume can be expressed as [ sv ] v=2(r_++ ) .",
    "obviously , when @xmath25 , it will give the result similar to that in @xcite .",

    "it indeed exhibits @xmath48 criticality .",
    "however , in this paper we want to treat eq.([eos ] ) exactly .",
