    "the isotope effect derives from the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 being proportional to the debye temperature . since the debye temperature is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the atomic mass , the isotope - effect coefficient for the transition temperature is @xmath3 @xmath4 .",

    "is caused by the dominant role of disorder , thermal and quantum fluctuations and not related to the pairing mechanism .",
    "this differs fundamentally from conventional superconductors , where fluctuations do not play an essential role so that the formation of pairs and their condensation occur essentially simultaneously and where the isotope effect allowed to identify the electron - phonon interaction as the dominant pairing interaction .",

    "these estimates coincide with the theoretical prediction for a 2d disordered bosonic system with long - range coulomb interactions@xcite .",

    "the main effect of isotope substitution is the shift of @xmath44 to a slightly larger and of @xmath48 to a slightly lower value . concentrating on the behavior close to 2d - qsi criticality , we obtain with eq.([eq7a ] ) the expression @xmath92 thus",

    "<S> the isotope effects do not provide information on the underlying pairing mechanism but must be attributed to a shift of the phase diagram upon isotope substitution . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d - qsi transition is driven by the exchange of pairs , which favors superconductivity and the combined effects of disorder and coulomb repulsion of the pairs , which favor localization . </S>",
    "<S> since isotope substitution will hardly affect disorder and coulomb repulsion , the shift of the phase diagram must be attributed to the electron - phonon interaction , which renormalizes the mass of the fermions and with that the mass and the exchange of the pairs . </S>"
