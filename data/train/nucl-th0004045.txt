    "this enables the study of pion absorption and production processes on very light nuclei , and is a next step of including explicit pion degrees of freedom , beyond the standard nuclear picture where mesonic degrees of freedom are `` frozen out '' , into nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "we are in particular interested in a set of theories which can be classified by the acronym trabam ( thomas - rinat , afnan- blankleider , avishai - mizutani ) , ref .",
    "@xcite . in recent years",
    ", a fair amount of effort has been made to extend this theory to the pion - three - nucleon domain , where a richer range of phenomena is possible . in a sequence of papers @xcite ,",
    "this system has been explored in the attempt to arrive at a consistent and connected theory of the coupled @xmath0nnn - nnn system .",
    "this effort has required the blending of the standard three- and four - body theories of alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) @xcite , with the possibility that a pion can appear and disappear anywhere in the system , and in any of its subsystems .    in a recent paper ,",
    "one of the authors @xcite elucidated a connected , coupled scheme for the combined @xmath0nnn - nnn dynamics .",
    "furthermore , he derived , by the use of the quasi - particle formalism at three - cluster and two - cluster levels , an equation for the coupled @xmath0nnn - nnn system , that has the appearance of a coupled set of lippmann - schwinger type equations : @xmath1 an equation of this type was first given by lovelace @xcite in the standard three - particle problem with separable interactions , using the original theory by faddeev @xcite .",
    "it was also derived by ags @xcite who applied the quasiparticle approximation to their three - body equations .",
    "equation ( [ ele ] ) , like the faddeev - lovelace - ags equation , is a coupled set of integral equations in one inter - cluster momentum variable , but here the labels @xmath2 run over four values , rather than three : @xmath3 representing the configuration consisting of a three - nucleon cluster with the pion separate , and @xmath4 representing the three possible arrangements of the three nucleons in a pair and a separated nucleon ( the usual ags - lovelace scheme ) with the pion associated with either the pair or the single nucleon , or absent .",
    "( see table ii in @xcite . )    the driving term in this equation is given in terms of quantities associated with the two levels of separable approximations needed when the quasiparticle method is applied @xcite to the full @xmath0nnn - nnn system of equations , as follows @xmath5    this equation looks rather complicated with the multiple sums and inclusion rules , but , in fact , it turns out to be rather simple , once all these rules are applied and the delta - functions invoked .",
    "we will define in detail symbols in this equation below , but let us first look at the structure of this driving term .",
    "the first term contains only components from the three - nucleon ( no - pion ) sector , and therefore can not contribute at all if @xmath3 or @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the only contributions to this term can come from the case @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this case the first term of eq .",
    "( [ driv ] ) does not contribute on the diagonal ( i.e. @xmath9 ) because of the anti - delta function . off the diagonal ,",
    "since this contains only nucleon degrees of freedom , this term can properly be identified with the driving term of the traditional ags - lovelace approach to the standard three - nucleon problem .",
    "for @xmath10 there is no contribution to @xmath11 also from the second term , because the inclusion prescriptions in the sums can not be satisfied if @xmath10 .",
    "more explicitly , since @xmath9 , only the last term in the delta - function structure survives , but this requires @xmath12 .",
    "however , for @xmath3 , there is only one two - cluster state , namely @xmath13 , so the condition @xmath12 can not be satisfied . therefore , the driving terms do not contribute at all in the case @xmath10 , either in the first , or in the second term .",
    "the second term does have non - zero values in the diagonal case @xmath14 , and this provides additional diagonal terms to eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) due to the coupling to the pion degrees of freedom . even if small , such contributions compare to zero and therefore can hardly be neglected .",
    "the second term contributes also to the off - diagonal elements , thus providing corrections to the dominant terms of the standard three - nucleon problem . in eq .",
    "( [ driv ] ) , @xmath15 are components of the form - factor vector coming from the separable approximation at the two - cluster level , the subscript `` - '' representing the no - pion sector , the subscripts @xmath16 being the yakubovsk@xcite chain labels for the chains of partition of the ( conserved ) four - body system , @xmath0nnn . the quantity @xmath17 is the free propagator for three nucleons , in the absence of pions ; the quantity @xmath18 denotes the intermediate propagation of the possible three - cluster structures of the @xmath0nnn system . in other words , the separable representation of the two - particle @xmath19-matrix , according to @xmath20 describes effectively all the elastic two - body processes in the 4-body space , with @xmath21 representing either the @xmath22 or the @xmath23 two - body @xmath19-matrix .",
    "the `` anti - delta '' function is : @xmath24 .",
    "the inclusions under the summation symbols are intended in the usual sense of yakubovsk chain inclusions .",

    "[ aa ] .    to solve eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) one must first define and construct the states @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the two - cluster green s function @xmath38 .",
    "it is precisely at this point that we propose herein a workable approximation scheme .",
    "however , before discussing the approximation , we recall for clarity the rigorous result obtained in ref .  @xcite . for complete details",
    "we refer to that work .    starting from the two - particle representation eq .",
    "( [ apole ] ) , one can derive the dynamical sub - amplitude containing the interactions internal to the coupled set of partitions @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath42 where the @xmath31 index should be interpreted with the fact that nucleon  1 \" is set apart from the other two : obviously , the other cases with @xmath43 are obtained by cyclic permutations of the nucleons .",
    "the @xmath3 amplitude instead contains all the interactions internal to the single @xmath44 partition , hence the pion is set apart from the three nucleons here .",
    "the dynamical equations for these four subamplitudes are given by ( see eqs .",
    "( 3.21 - 24 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for each @xmath48 , the subamplitudes @xmath49 have components labelled by the yakubovsk chain labels ( @xmath16 ) , or by the symbol  - \" in the case of the no - pion sector , where the index _ s _ specifies a unique physical partition ( last column of table ii in @xcite ) . only when @xmath3 , all couplings to the no - pion sector are vanishing .",
    "these coupled equations are obtained once the representation eq .",
    "( [ apole ] ) has been assumed , and the amplitudes are expressed in the 4-body space in the corresponding quasiparticle representation .",
    "@xmath50 is the full 4-body free propagator , @xmath17 is the already mentioned free three - nucleon propagator in the no - pion sector , @xmath51 is the pair potential between the two interacting nucleons in the partitions denoted by _ s _ and , in addition to the short - range part of the 2n potential , it includes explicitely the ope diagram .",
    "finally , @xmath52 is the elementary creation ( annihilation ) vertex for a pion into ( from ) the appropriate subsystem denoted by the chain - label subscript .",
    "an important aspect of these subamplitudes is that it is always possible to factor out a dirac @xmath53 function in momentum space for the  spectator \" nucleon ( or pion , for @xmath3 ) .",
    "the new aspect obtained in ref.@xcite is that this factorization property has been maintained when there is a pion associated with either the nucleon pair or the spectator nucleon , or when there is no pion at all .",
    "the basic assumption for the @xmath54 subamplitudes consists in the finite - rank representation @xmath55 this representation provides all the ingredients needed to construct the connected dynamical equation ( [ ele ] ) .",
    "we have limited here the discussion to the case of one separable term , but the algebraic generalization of eq.([ele ] ) to more separable terms is straightforward .",
    "although this is a very relevant issue , we will not concentrate here on the mathematical aspects and general constraints needed to obtain a mathematically converging separable expansion for the subamplitudes @xmath56 .",
    "a very clear explanation about the general methods required for considering such questions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will instead concentrate on the development of an approximate scheme for the separable representation of such subamplitudes .",
    "the proposed approximation scheme is based on the physical assumption that in standard nuclear physics the picture of nucleons interacting via realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials , with the pion degrees of freedom `` frozen out '' , provides an acceptable first - order description of the low - energy / low - momenta dynamics .",
    "the effects of including explicit pionic degrees of freedom beyond that picture should then be considered only as dynamical `` corrections '' .    if we consider eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) , we observe that the last term accounts in fact for the one - pion dynamics in the 2n subsystem ( @xmath7 ) , once the ope diagram has been taken out ( because it is already included in @xmath51 ) . in particular @xmath57 represents the complete , elastic 2n amplitude in presence of a spectator nucleon .",
    "obviously , @xmath57 should be obtained from the coupled set of eqs .",
    "( [ first]-[last ] ) , but we will identify instead @xmath57 with the conventional 2n @xmath19-matrix , derived by the solution of the standard 2n lippmann - schwinger equation ( in the presence of a spectator nucleon ) using as input the phenomenological nn potential . in other words , we set to zero the last term of eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) and use for @xmath51 the conventional nn potential which includes in an effective way the contributions from the pion-2n dynamics .",
    "note that there will be a price to pay for this ; namely , all _ disconnected _ dispersive effects to the 3n dynamics , originated in the 2n subsystems by the dynamical equations ( [ first]-[last ] ) , will be approximated to zero .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the dynamical description of the pion degrees of freedom implied by these equations has been replaced with an istantaneous , effective 2n potential .",
    "implicitely , this approximation is assumed in all potential approaches to the 3n problem , but it has not really been tested .",
    "the exception is in ref .",
    "@xcite , where these dispersive effects of the 2n subsystem have been sized in the extreme situation where the @xmath0n interaction is entirely represented by its coupling through a forward propagating @xmath58-isobar .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath58-mediated , disconnected dispersive effects in the 3n system turned out to be not negligible .",
    "it is clear that this problem should be investigated further ; nevertheless we will not do this here since our aim is to follow in this respect the standard potential approach to the 3n problem , where the 3n dispersive effects generated in the 2n subsystems are completely ignored .",
    "once we have accepted that the 2n dynamics in the _ elastic _ channel is described by means of a phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potential , our description can be closely compared to the usual , potential - based , quantum - mechanical 3n approaches since the dynamical input of the two approaches appears to be identical .",
    "then , if we consider eq .",
    "( [ supersep4 ] ) , this reduces to the well - known , standard separable representation of the two - nucleon @xmath19-matrix , which we express in the polar form @xmath59 and this already gives the approximations @xmath60",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 , and @xmath63 @xmath61 @xmath64 which are needed for the determination of the driving term ( first contribution ) and for the kernel of eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the form factors @xmath65 for nn interactions are , in this approximation , not distinct from the form factors @xmath66 of the quasiparticle approximation at the three - cluster level , eq.([apole ] ) .",
    "both come , in fact , from the pole approximation of the elastic two - nucleon @xmath19-matrix .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath65 factor refers only to the 2n @xmath19-matrices and is expressed in the ( nn)+n two - cluster space , with one jacobi coordinate removed already .",
    "the form factor @xmath66 , on the other hand , refers to all the two - body @xmath19-matrices in the 4-body space , and this includes also the @xmath0n @xmath19-matrices in addition to the nn ones .",
    "thus , a convenient feature emerges from the approach herein discussed : only one standard pole approximation ( or expansion , in the more general case of higher ranks ) has to be made for the two - nucleon interaction , to be used for the 2n @xmath19-matrices in both 4-body and 3n spaces . at this point",
    "one fact must be stressed : namely , if we do not consider further contributions , our description precisely collapses into the quantum - mechanical approach to the 3n system in terms of a 2n potential , since the resulting 3n equations have _ exactly _ the ags form .",
    "this is because all couplings to @xmath0nnn state are made via the components @xmath67 which would be set to zero in this case .",
    "thus , these components , together with the @xmath3 partition , are fundamental for an explicit treatment of the pion degrees of freedom in the 3n system , and we get an approximation of the @xmath67 factors , to the lowest order , by considering in particular eq .",
    "( [ s - last ] ) .",
    "assuming that the leading contributions to @xmath68 are dominated by the pole structures ( see eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) ) of @xmath69 in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ s - last ] ) , we obtain @xmath70 and considering eq .",
    "( [ supersep3 ] ) , @xmath71 this provides the form factors needed for the second term of eq .",
    "( [ driv ] ) , which in this approximation represents the contribution entirely responsible for the explicit treatment of the pion dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) , beyond that effectively contained in the static 2n potential .",
    "the @xmath72 on the left of this is needed because the quasiparticle approximation has already been made for the pair interaction in the four - body space , by eq .",
    "( [ apole ] ) .",
    "( [ driv ] ) also requires the  bra \" vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "we simply construct the adjoints , by taking the corresponding  bra \" states of the underlying quasiparticle approximation eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) of the standard 2n .",
    "in other words @xmath75 and @xmath76    in the extended 3n equation , eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) , we identify three types of new contributions which take into account , to the lowest order , the explicit pion dynamics .",
    "these contributions modify the driving term @xmath77 of the standard ags equation in a very selective way .",
    "the first contributions enlarge the number of components with respect to the three standard faddeev components , with the addition of the fourth component ( @xmath3 ) specifying the partition when the pion is set apart from the three nucleons .",
    "such contributions provide the new couplings between @xmath3 and @xmath8 , as well as with @xmath7 and @xmath78 .",
    "these link the 3n faddeev components with the partition consisting of a three - nucleon cluster and a separated pion ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a second type of terms enter in the diagonal part , @xmath79 , of @xmath80 while traditionally these elements have been assumed to be vanishing in the standard 3n theory : hence , these terms should be considered important since they compare to zero in the standard ags equation .",
    "finally , the second term of eq.([driv ] ) provides corrections also for @xmath81 , that is for the off - diagonal elements of the driving term .",
    "instances of such terms are shown in the last three contributions of eq .",
    "( 1.2@xmath28 ) .",
    "they all represent modifications that have to be added to the standard 3n driving term , identified with the first contribution in eq .",
    "( [ driv ] ) .",
    "thus , the new contributions coming from the explicit pion degrees of freedom , provide minimal , though important , modifications to the standard ags formulation of the three - nucleon problem .",

    "this sum is evidenced in the first row of tab .",
    "all these contributions represent the proper quasiparticle generalization of the standard 2n form factor , in presence of a spectator nucleon , to the pion inelastic channel .",

    "( [ z - pionic01 ] ) one can show that the term @xmath113 can be written as @xmath118 and the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ newclass ] is just one contribution to this structure .",
    "note that the pion can couple any of the three ingoing nucleon lines with each one of the three outgoing lines .",
    "moreover this occurs with all possible recombinations in intermediate 2n pairs .",
    "this set of diagrams represent another , new class of irreducible 3n mechanisms contributing to the construction of the 3n force .",
    "physically , these diagrams represent all possible _ connected _ correlations among the three nucleons while the exchanged pion is in flight . on the contrary , the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ s = s ] represent all possible _ disconnected _ 2n correlations while the pion is in flight .",
    "recently , a new approach for the explicit treatment of the pion dynamics in the 3n system has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "herein , we have shown how to derive from this formulation a practical calculation scheme which is phenomenologically sound .",
    "the approximation is based on the assumption that the elastic 2n subamplitudes can be conveniently described with the phenomenological 2n potential approach . in other words , instead of treating explicitly the pion dynamics in full , in the 3n system we describe explicitely only those aspects of the pion dynamics which can not be buried into the all - comprehensive , phenomenological 2n potential .",
    "thus , the procedure could be viewed as a method to cool down ( or to gradually project out ) the pion dynamics from the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one advantage of making such an approximation is that this approach is not plagued with the nucleon - renormalization problem , since the dynamical equation used to construct the subsystem amplitudes is represented by the standard 2n lippmann - schwinger equation , where the nucleon masses are static .",
    "however the approach includes also the pion degrees of freedom , via the inelastic subamplitudes .",
    "these are represented as 2n form factors defined in the yakubovsk chain - labelled space of the ( four - body ) @xmath0nnn system . here",
    ", we consider only the first - order contributions to such inelastic form factors in terms of the effective @xmath0nn coupling vertex , see tab.[aa ] .",
    "( it is evident that more complex rescattering mechanisms contributing to such form factors can be implemented at a later stage . )",
    "another advantage of this approach is that the dynamical input can be constrained by the 2n experimental data ; therefore the method can be directly compared with the standard quantum - mechanical approach to the 3n problem based upon a 2n potential description .    by using a separable - expansion representation of the elastic nn @xmath19-matrix",
    ", it has been possible to recast the dynamical equation into an extended ags form , where the part of the pion dynamics not buried in the 2n potential is treated explicitly .",
    "we discussed the three modifications implied by this extended 3n equation with respect to the normal ags one .",
    "first , the 3@xmath1193 ags driving term , defined in terms of the three faddeev components , acquires additional contributions from the pion dynamics , and these new contributions act in both diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements ( while the standard ags driving term is known to act only in the off - diagonal elements ) .",
    "we discussed these contributions also in terms of their diagrammatic interpretation , and found that the off - diagonal corrections correspond , to their lowest order , to irreducible 3n - force diagrams where the pion , while being exchanged between two nucleons , rescatters from the third before annihilating .",
    "this rescattering mechanism is practically the only case discussed in the construction of the pionic part of the 3n force . and the different 3nf approaches differ mainly for the model representation of the @xmath0n rescattering amplitude ; there are , of course , additional short - range effects where there is much more ambiguity and where the various 3nf models differ considerably among each other .",
    "conversely , the second modification refers to the diagonal part of the driving term , and represents irreducible 3n - force diagrams of different topology , where it is one of the two nucleons exchanging the pion that rescatters with the third one .",
    "these 3nf diagrams are not included in the construction of modern 3n potentials because it is usually assumed that they cancel out if one takes into account meson retardation effects in all their possible variety of time orderings .",
    "however , as has been pointed out in a recent study  @xcite , this cancellation as a 100% effect is questionable .",
    "the reason for questioning the cancellation is due to the fact that a full 2n sub - amplitude enters in this 3n - force diagram , while the cancellation involves only the  instantaneous \" part of the diagram .",
    "the construction of 3nf models from meson - exchange mechanisms evaluated in terms of instantaneous processes will lead inevitably to a 100% cancellation effect ; however such methods do not take into account that two nucleons may clusterize while the pion is being exchanged , and this implies that an entire set of rescattering processes have to be subsummed during the pion - exchange process , thus leading to an incomplete cancellation effect .",
    "the third and last modification with respect to the normal ags equation implies the increasing of the matrix dimension by one unit , since the 3 faddeev components are now coupled to the additional two - cluster partition @xmath0+(nnn ) .",
    "we have discussed the structure of such couplings and the corresponding diagrams , thus providing details for all the ingredients of this new dynamical equation .",
    "finally , we have shown that it is possible to project out the effects of the coupling to this pionic channel , thus providing a 3n dynamics with explicit treatment only for the 3n coordinates .",
    "this modification is suited for treatments of the 3n system at lower energies , below the pion threshold .",
    "then , the extended ags equation involves only the three standard faddeev components , and the effect of the @xmath0+(nnn ) channel in the intermediate states is contained into an additional , third contribution to the driving term .",
    "we have analyzed the diagrams involved and found that they correspond to a third class of irreducible 3nf diagrams , topologically different from the other , previously discussed two classes .",
    "the diagrams correspond to the variety of connected correlations amongst the three nucleons while the meson is in flight .",
    "in other words , these mechanisms take into account all possible 3n - cluster effects while the meson is being exchanged .",
    "this new correction acts in both diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the driving term and may possibly influence the structure of the 3n force .",
