    "<S> the strong modifications of dijet properties in heavy ion collisions measured by atlas and cms provide important constraints on the dynamical mechanisms underlying jet quenching . in this work , we show that the transport of soft gluons away from the jet cone  jet collimation  can account for the observed dijet asymmetry with values of @xmath0 that lie in the expected order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that the energy loss attained through this mechanism results in a very mild distortion of the azimuthal angle dijet distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical reach of the lhc allows for systematic studies involving fully reconstructed calorimetric jets to be carried out , and for the ensuing analyses to be significant beyond the experimental uncertainties inherent to the identification of jets in a fluctuating high multiplicity environment .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the dijet asymmetry @xmath1 in pb - pb collisions at @xmath2 tev by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite provides a clear example of the extent to which such full jet measurements can contribute to furthering the understanding of the dynamical processes responsible for jet quenching . in the analyzed dijet event samples , the transverse energies of the jets are identified within cones of radius @xmath3 ( 0.4 for atlas , 0.5 for cms ) . for the leading jet , it is @xmath4 gev ( atlas ) , @xmath5 gev ( cms ) , while for the recoiling jet  found at an azimuthal separation @xmath6 ( atlas ) and @xmath7 ( cms )  it is @xmath8 gev ( atlas ) , @xmath9 gev ( cms ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured event asymmetry distribution shows qualitative features consistent with a substantial medium induced energy loss of the recoiling jet . in a nutshell , </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of energy lost from the recoiling jet cone is larger in heavy ion collisions than in the proton - proton case , and grows with increasing centrality of those collisions . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , this effect is accompanied by a distortion of the dijet azimuthal distribution which is , at most , very mild . as such </S>",
    "<S> , this measurement carries the hallmark of an underlying dynamical mechanism capable of carrying a substantial amount of energy away from the jet cone without any significant deflection of the jet direction .    in the 10% most central events ( for which the observed effect is stronger ) , the average amount of energy lost from the recoiling jet cone in addition to the proton - proton case falls within the bounds @xcite @xmath10 here </S>",
    "<S> , the lower bounds were obtained by assuming that all recoiling jets traverse the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bounds resulted from taking only a fraction ( @xmath11 , the ratio of symmetric @xmath12 dijet events in pb - pb and proton - proton ) as interacting with the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism  jet collimation  that leads to both large energy degradation and no sizeable azimuthal displacement was proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> soft gluons radiated at small angles result in a very small azimuthal displacement of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> these gluons , and in fact all partons in the parton shower , undergo brownian motion during their passage through the medium and thus accumulate an average squared transverse momentum @xmath13 per unit path length , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the presence of a medium , the average formation time @xmath15 for partons of energy @xmath16 is @xmath17 as a result , soft jet fragments are formed early and those with energy @xmath18 will be completely decorrelated from the initial jet direction , see fig.[fig : ] ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the medium acts as a frequency collimator , efficiently trimming away the soft components of the jet by transporting them to large angles . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the observation by cms @xcite that the energy lost from a jet cone is fully recovered at large angles and in the form of soft partons .    </S>",
    "<S> ( left ) jet collimation : soft gluons emmited at small angles are transported outside the jet cone by their multiple random scatterings with medium components . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) azimuthal angle distribution of dijet events : the considered values of @xmath19 correspond to the cases in which either all recoiling jets are taken as interacting with the medium or only a fraction ( @xmath20 0.5 ) do.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] ( left ) jet collimation : soft gluons emmited at small angles are transported outside the jet cone by their multiple random scatterings with medium components . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) azimuthal angle distribution of dijet events : the considered values of @xmath19 correspond to the cases in which either all recoiling jets are taken as interacting with the medium or only a fraction ( @xmath20 0.5 ) do.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]    in @xcite , we showed that jet collimation can displace a sufficiently large fraction of the total jet energy outside the cone . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that jet collimation is effective even in the absence of any other medium induced effects . in other words , even in the extreme case in which the interaction with the medium does not result in any modification of the parton shower , jet collimation will result in the transport of a significant amount of energy away from the jet cone .    in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one can take the vacuum intra - jet multiplicity distribution @xmath21 in the modified leading log approximation ( known to be sufficiently accurate for small longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath22 ) to compute the energy fraction carried by partons with an energy fraction smaller than @xmath23 @xmath24 if jet collimation is sole medium modification , then @xmath25 can be estimated by determining the highest @xmath23 to which the integration in eq.([eq : energy ] ) must be extended so as to account for the energy loss in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : enatlas ] , [ eq : encms ] ) . thus , since @xmath26 , we obtain that    @xmath27    the inclusion of other medium induced effects , such as medium induced radiation , leads in general to a softening of the intra - jet multiplicity . while these other effects may not be important for the description of the jet asymmetry data , they are crucial in accounting for the suppression of single particle observables . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of these effects leads to the generic observation that the same energy loss would be achieved with lower values of @xmath19 . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the estimates eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : atlasqhatl ] , [ eq : cmsqhatl ] ) provide upper bounds . </S>",
    "<S> since there is not yet a consensus on the precise underlying dynamics leading to this softening @xcite , in @xcite , we use one particular simple model @xcite as an estimate of this effect : @xmath28 these values of @xmath19 will necessary lead to a modification of the azimuthal dijet distribution . for jet collimation to be a valid candidate mechanism of jet quenching , </S>",
    "<S> these modifications need to be sufficiently small as not to contradict the very mild distortion observed experimentally . to estimate the effect of the medium induced broadening , we take the reference azimuthal distribution from the proton - proton case in @xcite as corresponding to an unmodified jet that can be embedded in a heavy ion event </S>",
    "<S> . the effect of jet collimation on this distribution can be assessed by smearing the transverse momentum corresponding to each azimuthal angle @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the average energy carried by a recoiling jet in central pbpb collisions ) with a gaussian weight of average squared transverse momentum @xmath19 . following the two extreme models we have considered , the smearing is performed in all jets or only on a fraction ( @xmath11 ) of them . </S>",
    "<S> the displaced momenta can them be recast as azimuthal angles . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this procedure is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ] ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> there it is clear that even for the highest @xmath19 values consistent with cms data , the distortion of the azimuthal distribution due to the transport of soft partons outside of the jet cone is very mild and not significant beyond the differences between proton - proton data ( open circles ) and its pythia generated counterpart ( solid histogram ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this estimate also shows the difficulty in determining the medium induced broadening of high energy jets , since even in vacuum there is a significant momentum imbalance of the dijet pair ( @xmath31 for cms jets ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even for the largest medium induced momentum broadening we have considered , the most salient change in the dijet azimuthal distribution is a reduction of the yield at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental quantification of this effect demands an accurate determination of this azimuthal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a measurement is complicated by the presence of the large hadronic background for jet reconstruction in lead - lead collisions which also broadens the dijet azimuthal distribution . while a precise determination of this effect requires a full study along the lines of @xcite , it is clear from the studies of pythia jets into heavy ion effects performed in @xcite that the effect of background particles is comparable to the one of momentum broadening .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the jet collimation mechanism proposed in @xcite is fully consistent with all available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it can account for the necessary energy loss from the jet cone without , as has been shown here , leading to an observable distortion of the azimuthal angle dijet event distribution . </S>",
    "<S> as such , the transport of soft jet components ought to be included in any formulation of jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed qualitative assessment of jet collimation should proceed via its implementation in existing in medium monte carlo codes .    </S>",
