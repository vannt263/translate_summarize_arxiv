    "the study of gauge theories at high temperatures has found application in the description of a quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions and for the physics of the early universe . in recent years , it has become apparent that conventional perturbation theory breaks down when considering energy scales much smaller than the temperature . in the case of hot qcd ,",
    "this realisation led to the development of a resummation scheme based on hard thermal loops@xcite .    recently in a paper by elmfors , enqvist and vilja @xcite , the method of hard thermal loops was applied to the electroweak theory in order to determine the thermalisation rate of fluctuations in the higgs field . in this paper , we use the same methods to study the thermalisation rate of the gauge field in the abelian higgs model .",
    "this is a first step towards the calculation of the thermalisation rate for a more realistic theory .",
    "the thermalisation rate may be used to determine the time at which the gauge bosons associated with a grand unified theory will ` freeze out ' in an expanding universe .",
    "this may be of use in the subject of baryogenesis in the early universe .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the thermalisation rate @xmath1 from the imaginary part of the temperature dependent feynman self energy @xmath2 via @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy of a given mode . we shall be calculating the thermalisation rate of large scale fluctuations ( that is at zero 3-momentum ) .",
    "we use the real time formalism of thermal field theory@xcite since it is straightforward to extract the imaginary part of the self energy in this formalism @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief overview of the abelian higgs model and present the corrections to the propagators and vertices in the hard thermal loop approximation . in section 3",
    "we use these results to calculate the thermalisation rate both above and below the critical temperature at which the phase transition occurs .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in section 4 .",
    "the abelian higgs model consists of a complex scalar field minimally coupled to a @xmath5 gauge field .",
    "it is described by the lagrangian @xmath6 with covariant derivative @xmath7 and abelian field strength tensor @xmath8 .",
    "we choose @xmath9 so that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "expanding @xmath10 about its expectation value as @xmath11 we may rewrite eqn.[lag ] as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a potential term containing only cubic and quartic terms . @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume @xmath17 .",
    "the gauge is chosen so as to simplify the calculation .",
    "that is we choose the gauge so as to both simplify the explicit form of the propagators used and also to reduce the number of diagrams contributing to hard thermal loops . to this end",
    "we choose to use the thooft gauge ( the renormalisable @xmath18 gauge with @xmath19 ) .",
    "we do not use the covariant gauge as the propagators in this gauge must be resummed due to mixing between the photon and the unphysical goldstone mode . as shown in @xcite",
    ", this resummation leads to real time propagators that contain derivatives of dirac delta functions .",
    "although there is in principle no problem with using such propagators , it is much simpler to use the renormalisable gauges which do not need this kind of resummation .",
    "the thooft gauge is then chosen as it enables us to reduce the number of diagrams contributing hard thermal loops .",
    "this is due to the particularly simple form of the photon propagator .",
    "the only disadvantage of this choice of gauge is that fadeev - popov ghosts must be included .    as a result of this choice of gauge",
    ", the following terms must be added to the lagrangian .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ghost field . as a result of this choice of gauge",
    ", the goldstone mode acquires a mass @xmath22 equal to that of the gauge boson .",
    "the leading order corrections in the hard thermal loop approximation are known in the case of the abelian higgs model@xcite .",
    "we shall not repeat these calculations but merely quote the results . at high temperatures ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value(vev ) decreases from it s zero temperature value , reaching zero at the critical temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature dependant vev @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 the masses of the scalar and ghost sectors of the theory , are affected only by the change in the vev .",
    "that is the temperature dependant masses @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 however for the gauge boson there is a high temperature correction in addition to that due to the temperature dependant vev .",
    "this additional contribution depends on the polarisation .",
    "that is there are three mass corrections corresponding to the spatially transverse and longitudinal polarisations and to the 4-vector longitudinal polarisation .",
    "these masses are given by @xcite @xmath29 there are no hard thermal loop corrections to the vertices @xcite .",
    "we shall be calculating the thermalisation rate at zero momentum .",
    "as such we define @xmath30 to be the value of the self energy of the transverse and longitudinal modes in this limit .",
    "@xmath31    above the critical temperature ,",
    "the symmetry is restored .",
    "there is now no distinction between the higgs and goldstone fields .",
    "the masses for the particles are now @xmath32",
    "to calculate the thermalisation rate we need the imaginary part of the self - energy@xcite . in the real time formalism , the imaginary part of the feynman self energy is most easily calculated from the @xmath33-@xmath34 component of the self energy via the relation @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "we are working in the symmetric version of the real time formalism ( that is @xmath37 in the notation of landsman and van weert @xcite ) .      to proceed with the calculation we need the explicit form for the @xmath33-@xmath34 component of the resummed propagators .",
    "for the scalar and ghost sector of the theory , this is easy due to the simple form of the hard thermal loop mass correction .",
    "however care must be taken with the photon propagator due to the complicated momentum dependance of the self energies .",
    "the @xmath33-@xmath34 propagators for the higgs and goldstone modes are given by @xmath38 the self energies of the transverse and longitudinal modes acquire an imaginary contribution . by dividing the propagator up into it s three polarisations we can treat each case separately .",
