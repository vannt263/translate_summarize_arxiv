    "as psf , we used the faint red star ",
    "s  noted by w92 ( see fig . 1 here )  circularly averaged to improve its s / n .",
    "the maximum possible point source that can be subtracted from 53w002 s core without making its central flux negative is 25@xmath202% of the total light in @xmath19 , 21@xmath203% in @xmath17 , and 20@xmath202% in @xmath18 .",

    "the upper error boundaries of these fractions are firm , so that the agn contribution to 53w002 s total continuum is definitely @xmath2330% , but the lower boundaries are soft . the agn contribution could be 15% of its total continuum , which would in fig .",

    "53w002 s agn contribution is : @xmath2424.3 , or @xmath2521.8 , assuming a power - law @xmath26-correction with @xmath141.0 ( w91 , p96 ) .      to address the symmetric extended component ,",
    "we only consider and fit the `` clean '' quadrant between the blue clouds discussed in  3.4 ( fig .",
    "the central parts of the galaxy in f450w can not be simultaneously fit by a single @xmath4 or exponential law . comparing these profile - fits to",
    "the psf shows that a small additional central light distribution ( with @xmath1005 ) is required , containing about half the flux of the nuclear point source , but with redder colors ( @xmath27=0.8@xmath200.1 ) .",
    "after subtraction of the central unresolved agn component (  3.1 ) , the underlying galaxy can be measured only in the quadrant _ between _ the two blue clouds (  3.4 ) .",
    "we concentrate on a region south of the nucleus , where nearly a full 90@xmath28 quadrant is clear of these contaminating sources .",
    "details of the elliptical profile fitting technique and its errors are given by w92 , keel & windhorst ( 1993 ) , windhorst ( 1994b , w94b ) , mutz ( 1997 ; m97 ) , and schmidtke ( 1997 ; sc97 ) .",
    "the major source of error is the sky - subtraction , but the sky in the pc - image stack is sufficiently low and flat that sky - subtraction errors are few % of sky . given these caveats , the @xmath2 light - profiles ( fig .",
    "3 ) follow an @xmath4-like profile closer than an exponential disk , although an early - type galaxy with a bulge - to - disk ratio 35 can not be ruled out .",
    "most of the deviation from an @xmath4-law at @xmath40.75 ( @xmath29032 ) occurs in @xmath19 & @xmath17 , and is due to the faint blue cloud leaking into the uncontaminated quadrant , and not only due to sky - subtraction errors , which affect the profile for sb@xmath3025.526.0 .",
    "we fit a family of @xmath4-profiles  convolved with the psf (  3.1 )  to the @xmath10 data in this area over the radial range @xmath29=29 pixels ( 0104 ) .",

    "its position angle ( @xmath31110 ) is uncertain , but consistent with the orientation of the aligned clouds ( @xmath31 95 ) , which appear to be separated by a redder feature (  3.4 & fig .",
    "the @xmath18-band profile is dominated by the continuum  and least affected by the blue clouds which contribute @xmath18% of the total @xmath18-band flux",
    " and is a somewhat better @xmath4-fit , consistent with a crossing time of collapsing galaxies that increases with radius ( fig .",
    "1 g in van albada 1982 ) .",
    "53w002 s average color is @xmath321.3 .",
    "its @xmath33 color of @xmath10.7 is less contaminated by the blue cloud . within the errors , both colors are relatively constant with radius , so that any color gradient must be small for @xmath2910 ( 0.3 mag across the @xmath10 image ) .",
    "w91 & w94b present 12-band ( @xmath34 ) photometry for 53w002 and surrounding objects , and w94b , m97 , & sc97 discuss spectral evolution model fits to these , and similar , color - redshift data to constrain stellar population ages ( defined as the onset of the major visible starburst ) . the general blue colors in fig .",
    "2f suggests that , with the exception of the region possibly affected by a  dust lane  , 53w002 is not enormously reddened by dust (  3.4 ) .",
    "following these models , the colors of the symmetric component of 53w002  if interpreted as coming from stars only  would suggest a stellar population with an average age of @xmath10.4 gyr , which is of the same order as its dynamical time scale (  4 ) . without the detection of a significant color gradient in the stellar population",
    ", the current data can not distinguish whether 53w002 formed through a sudden , global halo collapse ( els62 ) or through rapid merging of many sub - galactic sized units ( sz78 , p96 ) .",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 images that bracket the 4000break will help decide between these scenarios .",

    "the residuals after removing the symmetric pieces described in ",
    "3.13.3 trace the aligned blue  clouds  nicely .",
    "the larger cloud to the west  in the direction of the extended cloud ( fig .",
    "2a & w91 )  is quite extended and vaguely triangular ( fig .",
    "2e and insert in fig .",
    "1 ) . it peaks 045 west of the nucleus and extends 1from the core with an opening angle of about 45@xmath28 ( fig .",
    ", it is dominated by a brighter  arc  about 06 from the core ( fig .",
    "2a ) . on the opposite side is a very small blue object  possibly a  counter - cloud   elongated perpendicular to the nucleus - cloud direction and confined within 02 from the core ( fig .",
    "2e )  at the very limit of the @xmath0 resolution .",
    "these blue  clouds  comprise 13% and 5% , respectively , of the total f450w flux , and probably account for a good fraction of both the size [ ( i)@xmath111 ] and elongation of 53w002 inferred from the pre - refurbished wfc images in @xmath17 & @xmath18 ( w92 ) .",
    "hence , we now interpret 53w002 s stellar light distribution as much smaller and less elongated .",
    "similar analysis of the pc - images in & ( with correspondingly reduced angular resolution ) shows the same basic components ( fig .",
    "2c & 2d ) .",
    "the core and small extended region immediately surrounding it are significantly bluer than their surroundings , as is the western extended cloud ( fig .",
    "2f ) . with the exception of the  arc  at the edge of the larger cloud , the aligned components and the core are essentially free of line - contamination ( figs .",
    "the nucleus is a weak source , contributing only about 20% of the total flux ( fig .",
    "2a ) . contributes about 17% of the overall @xmath19 light in a 25 aperture , somewhat smaller than the @xmath130% expected from the integrated spectrum ( w91 & p96 ) .",
    "that is , the line emission is no more concentrated than the continuum light , and is thus not dominated by the nucleus . in the eastern cloud",
    ", contributes no more than 10% of the @xmath19-band flux , but the  arc  at the outer edge of the western cloud contributes as much as 93% .",
    "this is the only feature seen in the image with significant contrast against the rest of the galaxy in terms of equivalent width .",
    "these two blue clouds could represent :    \\(1 ) reflection of the agn - light shining through a cone , including and c - iv emission lines from gas lit up by the cone . the asymmetry in size and flux between eastern and western clouds ( fig .",
    "2b & 2e ) may represent obscuration or genuine physical differences . the fact that we can see a much larger and somewhat symmetric ground - based cloud ( compare our fig .",
    "2a to fig . 3 of w91 ) argues against obscuration , although this extended gas could be mostly in front of  or away from  any dust , and in part be unrelated to the agn .",
    "we note that two other z@xmath32.40 objects ( obj .",
    "18 & 19 of p96 ) are also agn with continuum reflection cones ( see inserts in plate 1 ) , but with a relatively stronger agn component compared to the surrounding material ( at the 5080% level of the total flux ) .",
    "the presence of these reflection cones implies the existence of a substantial amount of gas and/or dust well beyond the optical extent of these galaxies ( see  4 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) a star - bursting region induced by 53w002 s radio jet . compared to the spectral evolution models described by w94b , the much bluer colors of the cloud  if caused by stars  would suggest a star - bursting region @xmath37 years old .",
    "this is similar to the typical radio source lifetime , but younger than the galaxy s dynamical time scale .    a color map",
    " produced by matching the registration , sampling and resolution of the & images  shows the color contrast between the inner and outer regions of 53w002 ( fig .",
    "this map also provides an interesting clue as to the possible origin of the smaller `` cloud '' seen near the nucleus in the images : a red , almost linear feature appears to separate this smaller cloud from the nucleus . in nearby galaxies",
    ", this would suggest an organized dust lane .",
    "the color of the outskirts of this smaller cloud is @xmath320.6 ( at r=013 ) , and for the red `` dust '' lane it is @xmath321.0 .",
    "flux that does nt show up in these @xmath10 components must be redder yet to match the total ground - based ( w91 ) and the global @xmath11 color of @xmath321.3 ( which is close to colors of the symmetric halo ) .",
    "if this feature is indeed a dust lane , it would have a differential optical depth between 1300 and 2400   ranging from @xmath38 averaged over the resolution limit .",
    "this is rather mild by standards of present - day galaxies .",
    "the visual or blue extinction expected for this amount of far - uv extinction would be easy to miss in nearby radio galaxies , so the total amount of dust required is not excessive for objects like 53w002 , which might be chemically younger and correspondingly more metal - poor .",
    "the 8.4 ghz contours in fig . 2 show that the radio source is _ not _ smaller than the distance between the blue continuum clouds , and that the radio jet coincides with the bright  arc  in the western cloud , suggesting that jet - induced star - formation could indeed cause both blue clouds , except the outer parts of the western cloud .",
    "the latter has a more  jagged , triangular  shape , as the color image of plate 1 shows , and so may be caused by agn light in reflection .",
    "a recent interferometric ovro image of 53w002 in redshifted co ( j  32 )  which has 3fwhm  provides an important clue to the alignment effect ( s97 ) .",
    "the co was detected up to 23away on both sides of 53w002 s agn , _ and in the same direction as both blue @xmath11 clouds and the extended 8.4 ghz radio source , but not perpendicular to this direction , _ so that at least the co that coincides with the currently visible jet was likely deposited there by physical processes related to this jet . since carbon and oxygen had to be formed in massive stars , jet - induced star - formation",
    "thus likely played a role in 53w002 .",
    "the co extends further in both directions than the two aligned blue clouds and the current radio jet ( fig . 3 of s97 and fig .",
    "2a here ) .",
    "this is harder to understand through star - formation from the current compact jet , which is likely confined through a dense ism in the galaxy ( de vries 1997 ) , unless the jet in the past managed to get further out of the galaxy .",
    "this might be possible through holes in its dense ism , if e.g. 53w002 formed through the rapid merging of surrounding sub - galactic sized objects ( p96 ) .",
    "53w002 s @xmath4-like stellar population is extended in the same direction as the radio source , so that the jet possibly triggered a non - negligible fraction of 53w002 s mass to form stars in these two directions . as long as this all happened within a few@xmath39 years , there could have been just enough time for the stellar population to settle into a possible @xmath4-like profile . together with the continuum and morphology of the blue clouds (  3.4 & fig .",
    "2 ) , it thus appears that both reflection cones from an agn ( fig . 1 ) and",
    "jet - induced star - formation are responsible for the alignment effect in 53w002 .",
    "we can compare the structure of 53w002 to the @xmath11 images of powerful radio galaxies of longair , best , & r \" ottgering ( 1995 ) and best , longair , & r \" ottgering ( 1996 , 1997 ) . from a set of eight 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath40",
    ", they suggest that the morphologies change systematically with ( projected ) radio source size , and interpret this as evidence for jet - induced star formation in the aligned component . the radio galaxy 53w002 shares both properties with these powerful 3cr sources : a compact component",
    " the agn in the center of an extended starlight distribution  and a pair of clouds aligned with the projected radio axis .",
    "contrary to the 3cr sources , we can already see a fairly relaxed symmetric distribution of starlight centered around 53w002 s nucleus .",
    "in hindsight , it is perhaps surprising to find the aligned component to be important even at these low radio powers , but the continuity of structure with the powerful radio galaxies is striking , and required the extra resolving power of the @xmath41 in the @xmath19-band to observe in detail .",
    "[ [ w002s - gasdust - content - surrounding - cluster - and - possible - evolution ] ] 53w002 s gas+dust content , surrounding cluster , and possible evolution ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the measured fluxes and broad - band ubvrigrijhk colors of 53w002 constrain its dust absorption ( 0.2 mag ) and star formation rate ( sfr ; w91 , w94b ) .",
    "similar arguments have been made by p96 for the other 16 surrounding blue @xmath16 candidates .",
    "the sfr of 53w002 is of order @xmath1100/year ( w91 ) , and @xmath1510@xmath13 less for the other @xmath16 candidates ( p96 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass of 53w002  integrated over its assumed exponentially declining sfr  is @xmath42(w91 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-like light - profile of 53w002 suggests that at @xmath43 the object had already converted a non - negligible fraction of its gas mass into stars  rather efficiently on a @xmath10.4 gyr time - scale  suggesting a young early - type galaxy .",
    "the ovro co - flux of 1.5 jy / km / s implies @xmath44 in gas for 53w002 alone ( s97 ) .",
    "the velocity widths of the co clouds are @xmath1250 km / s ( hwhm ) , extending @xmath115 or @xmath113 kpc on each side of 53w002 in the direction of the blue clouds _ and _ of the extended radio source , and possibly indicating a forming rotation curve ( s97 ) .",
    "these numbers imply an enclosed keplerian mass of 1.53.8@xmath45 , consistent with its total stellar mass above ( w91 ) . taken together , this means that 53w002 s @xmath46(+co ) gas - mass could be @xmath13060% of its total ( luminous+gas+dark ) mass .    what could this mean for the evolution of 53w002 ?",
    "if all this gas settled into disk stars within a few free - fall times ( @xmath11 gyr ) , 53w002 could evolve into an mid - type spiral galaxy today ( with @xmath47-ratio @xmath10.5 ) , or into an earlier - type galaxy ( @xmath471 ) if it did not , and if a substantial fraction remained neutral ( as seen in some nearby ellipticals and merger remnants , hibbard 1995 ) .",
    "the small velocity dispersion ( 300 km / s ) in p96 s group of @xmath48 objects with measured redshifts , and the small area ( 1 mpc@xmath49 ) over which the 16 surrounding sub - galactic objects are seen , suggests that many of these objects will likely merge into a few larger galaxies during the next half hubble time after @xmath50 .",
    "hence , while 53w002 may have formed with a @xmath4-like profile during a relatively quick and sudden collapse that started at @xmath513 ( @xmath10.4 gyr before @xmath48 )  possibly through star - formation along its radio jet  it also appears to be developing a massive disk at @xmath52 ( s97 ) .",
    "this disk may have completely settled @xmath112 gyrs later ( or at @xmath531.5 ) , but possibly be destroyed again during future mergers ( at @xmath541.5 ) with the surrounding sub - galactic sized objects ( p96 ) , so that the radio galaxy 53w002 may end up as a massive early - type galaxy today .",
