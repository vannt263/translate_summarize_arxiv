    "the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ( _ r _ process ) is of fundamental importance to understand the nucleosynthesis of heavy neutron - rich nuclei and to account for their observed abundances @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the process takes place in astrophysical explosive neutron - rich environments when the density of free neutrons is so high that the capture of neutrons by nuclei is the dominant mechanism and much faster than the competing @xmath0-decay .",
    "however , the identification of the possible physical sites for _ r _ process is still one major unsolved challenge .",
    "neutron star mergers and neutrino - driven winds in core - collapse supernovae are two of the best suited scenarios ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the path that the _ r _ process follows and the final pattern of isotopic abundances are the result of a complex network of reactions and decays competing to each other in changing conditions of densities and temperatures . thus , to model the _ r _",
    "process one needs reliable nuclear physics input for masses , neutron capture reaction rates , photodisintegration rates , @xmath0-decay half - lives ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities ( @xmath3 ) for a large amount of nuclei ranging from the valley of stability to the neutron drip line .",
    "the sensitivity of the final abundance pattern to the various nuclear properties and astrophysical conditions has been largely studied ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that given the astrophysical conditions , the final abundance pattern is basically determined by the nuclear properties of nuclei along the _",
    "r_-process path , as well as on the properties of nuclei involved in the freeze - out at the last stages of the process leading nuclei back to stability .",
    "in particular , the peaks found in the _",
    "r_-process abundance pattern at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are associated with the relatively large @xmath0-decay half - lives in the waiting point nuclei with closed neutron shells @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the matter accumulates at these points creating peaks in the observed abundances . at these points of extra stability",
    "the neutron capture becomes inhibited and the nucleosynthesis flow is highly influenced by the large @xmath0-decay half - lives that finally determine the timescale of the whole process .    above @xmath10 , in the region between the two main peaks at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , there is also a smaller peak , which is away from closed neutron or proton shells .",
    "it appears at @xmath1 and is called the rare - earth peak .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the rare - earth peak is generated during the last stages of the _ r _ process as nuclei decay to stability .",
    "the peak is mainly due to the combined effects of nuclear deformation and @xmath0-decay @xcite and it is very sensitive to the nuclear properties of neutron - rich rare - earth isotopes of about 10 - 15 neutrons away from stability @xcite . on the other hand , it has also been argued that fission recycling with asymmetric fission fragment distributions may play a crucial role to understand the origin of the rare - earth peak @xcite",
    ". this would emphasize the role of neutron star mergers as possible sites for the generation of the rare - earth peak .",
    "thus , the characteristics of the rare - earth peak may offer unique insight into the late - time freeze - out behavior of the _ r _ process .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to measure the properties of nuclei far from the valley of stability involved in the _ r _ process because of the extremely low production yields in the laboratory . as a consequence ,",
    "there is still little experimental information on the quantities needed for astrophysics .",
    "although much progress is being made to measure masses and half - lives @xcite and there are promising perspectives for the next future in the new facilities at fair @xcite , ribf - riken @xcite , and frib - msu @xcite , the astrophysical simulations of the _ r _ process must still rely on extrapolations of the available data or on predictions from theoretical nuclear models .",
    "obviously , these models must prove first their reliability by reproducing the available data , which in the case of decay properties means half - lives and gamow - teller strength distributions measured in the laboratory .    in medium and heavy mass nuclei",
    ", the shell model needs very large configuration spaces that exceed the present computation capabilities and the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) has been shown to be well suited to describe the properties of these nuclei and in particular , their decay properties .",
    "qrpa calculations for neutron - rich nuclei have been performed in the past from spherical formalisms @xcite . however , although the mass regions of interest mentioned above surrounding the magic neutron numbers @xmath11 can be well described with such spherical formalisms , the _",
    "r_-process path crosses open - shell regions characterized by well deformed shapes .",
    "thus , deformed qrpa calculations , such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite have been developed .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath0-decay properties to nuclear deformation has been proven in the above references , showing that these properties may differ substantially from the spherical assumption and that it is necessary to include the nuclear deformation for reliable estimates .",
    "the sensitivity to deformation of the gt strength distributions has been exploited experimentally to be an additional source of information about the nuclear deformation , as it was shown in ref .",
    "the effects of deformation on the decay properties of neutron - rich isotopes in medium - mass nuclei from ge up to pd have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , demonstrating the need of theoretical formalisms accounting for nuclear deformation .",
    "the rare - earth region , including nuclei in the range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , is also well known to accommodate good rotors . however , very few studies of the decay properties of rare - earth nuclei are available yet",
    ". there are global calculations combining a microscopic qrpa approach for the gt response with the statistical gross theory for the first - forbidden ( ff ) decay @xcite .",
    "there are also deformed qrpa calculations based on woods - saxon potentials and realistic cd - bonn residual forces using the @xmath14-matrix @xcite .",
    "the finite - amplitude method has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain a global description of the decay properties within a skyrme qrpa with axial symmetry .",

    "r_-process nuclei @xcite .    in this work",
    "i investigate the nuclear structure related to the decay properties in the region of neutron - rich rare - earth nuclei of interest for the _ r _ process @xcite that includes xe , ba , ce , nd , sm , gd , and dy isotopes with neutron numbers @xmath15 . a theoretical formalism based on a deformed skyrme hf+bcs+qrpa approach",

    "the results are compared with the available experimental information on half - lives @xcite and with other theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , after testing the capability of the method to reproduce the measured half - lives , predictions are made in more exotic nuclei including some of the isotopes that are planned to be measured in the next future @xcite .",
    "also important for astrophysics are the gt strength distributions because they contain the underlying nuclear structure .",
    "given that the phase factors in a stellar medium at high densities and temperatures may be quite different from the temperature in the laboratory , the stellar half - lives may also differ substantially from the laboratory half - lives because of the thermal population of the decaying nuclei and because the electron distribution in the stellar plasma might block the @xmath0-particle emission @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : first , in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] i review the theoretical formalism used in this work .",
    "then , i show in sec . [ results ] the results obtained for the selfconsistent deformations in the neutron - rich isotopic chains of xe , ba , ce , nd , sm , gd , and dy , together with the energy distributions of the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength at the corresponding equilibrium deformations .",
    "i also calculate @xmath0-decay half - lives and probabilities for @xmath0-delayed neutron emission , comparing the results with experimental data and with results from other calculations .",
    "section iv summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "the theoretical formalism used in this work to study the decay properties of neutron - rich isotopes has been already introduced elsewhere @xcite and i only sketch here the main points .",
    "the method starts from a selfconsistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field calculation with skyrme interactions that includes pairing correlations and deformation .",
    "the calculations are performed with the force sly4 @xcite , which is a suitable representative of the skyrme forces .",
    "the fitting protocol of the parameters includes nuclear properties of unstable nuclei .",
    "the sensitivity of the decay properties to different choices of the underlying effective force is not critical and has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells . pairing between like nucleons",
    "is considered in the bcs approximation by solving the bcs equations after each hf iteration , using fixed gap parameters which are determined from the experimental odd - even mass differences when this information is available @xcite . when the masses are unknown the same pairing gaps as the closer isotopes measured are used .",
    "the method provides naturally the selfconsistent equilibrium deformations that minimize the energy and there is no need to introduce any extra parameter .    in a next step , a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa @xcite .",
    "the residual interaction contains two components acting in the particle - hole ( @xmath16 ) and in the particle - particle ( @xmath17 ) channels .",
    "the former can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used in the mean field calculation in terms of the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities . to simplify the calculation ,",
    "the @xmath16 residual force is expressed in a separable form @xcite .",
    "this is a repulsive interaction that redistributes the gt strength by reducing and moving it to higher excitation energies and thus , shifting the gt resonance .",
    "the coupling strength is usually taken to reproduce the location of the gt resonance @xcite .",
    "based on previous work , the value @xmath18 mev is taken here .",
    "the @xmath17 part is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "it is attractive and moves the gt strength to lower excitation energies .",
    "its coupling strength is usually fitted to reproduce the experimental half - lives @xcite .",
    "based on previous calculations ( see refs . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", the value @xmath19 mev is taken .",
    "one could fit these two coupling constants to reproduce the measured half - lives of particular nuclei , but because the aim here is to test the ability of the method to account for the decay properties in a global way , i use the same coupling strengths for all the nuclei considered in this work .",
    "the suitability of the separable forces has been tested in refs .",
    "@xcite by comparing the results obtained from qrpa using deformed woods - saxon potentials and realistic cd - bonn residual forces with similar calculations with separable forces .",
    "it has been shown that separable forces still keep the main characteristic of realistic residual forces , concluding that both approaches , realistic and separable , lead to similar results .    introducing the proton - neutron qrpa phonon operator that creates a gt excitation in an even - even nuclei as    @xmath20\\ , ,   \\label{phon}\\ ] ]",

    "@xmath0-decay half - lives are calculated by summing all the allowed transition strengths to states in the daughter nucleus with excitation energies lying below the corresponding @xmath43-energy , and weighted with the phase space factors @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    with @xmath46  s and @xmath47 , where 0.77 is a standard quenching factor .",
    "the @xmath48 energy is given by    @xmath49    written in terms of the nuclear masses @xmath50 or nuclear binding energies @xmath51 and the neutron ( @xmath52 ) , proton ( @xmath53 ) , and electron ( @xmath54 ) masses .",
    "the fermi integral @xmath44 is computed numerically for each value of the energy including screening and finite size effects , as explained in ref .",
    "this function increases with the energy of the @xmath0-particle and therefore the strength located at low excitation energies contributes more importantly to the half - life .    the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probability is calculated as    @xmath55    thus , @xmath3 corresponds to the probability of neutron emission with no distinction between emission of one , two , or more neutrons .",
    "the sum extends to all the excited sates in the daughter nucleus with excitation energies within the indicated ranges .",
    "@xmath56 is the one - neutron separation energy in the daughter nucleus . in this expression",
    "it is assumed that all the decays to energies above @xmath56 in the daughter nucleus lead to delayed neutron emission and then , @xmath57-decay from neutron unbound levels is neglected .",
    "thus , the probability is always overestimated .",
    "constrained hf+bcs calculations are performed to obtain energy curves that show the energy as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath58 .",
    "most of the energy curves in the isotopes studied in this work exhibit two local minima , prolate and oblate , separated by energy barriers that change with the neutron number .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] the isotopic evolution of the quadrupole deformations for the prolate and oblate equilibrium shapes plotted versus the neutron number @xmath59 .",
    "the results correspond to the unstable isotopes of the neutron - rich rare - earth nuclei considered in this work .",
    "the deformation of the ground state for each isotope is encircled .",
    "prolate ground state shapes are obtained in all the cases except some of the heavier isotopes that become oblate , and finally spherical when approaching the closed shell at @xmath9 .",
    "about the mid - shell one finds the largest deformations , as well as the largest energy barriers between the two minima .",
    "a very similar trend is observed in the profile of the curves in all the isotopic chains , showing larger deformations around mid - shell ( @xmath60 ) with values close to @xmath61 in the prolate sector and close to @xmath62 in the oblate one .",
    "the quadrupole deformations become smaller as one approaches the closed shell isotopes with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the deformations obtained in this work are in good agreement with those obtained with the gogny - d1s energy density functional that are available in ref .",
    "the shape transitions from prolate to oblate shapes is predicted to occur in this work between @xmath63 and @xmath64 in sm , gd , and dy isotopes .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results from gogny - d1s , where the transitions are predicted at @xmath63 in sm and gd and at @xmath65 in dy .",
    "transitions at @xmath64 in nd and at @xmath66 in ce are also predicted with gogny - d1s .",
    "it is also worth comparing the above results with those from modern global mass models , such as the semi - empirical nuclear mass formula based on macroscopic - microscopic methods @xcite .",
    "this mass formula predicts a shape transition from prolate to oblate at @xmath67 in xe , ba , ce , nd , sm , gd , and dy , respectively .",
    "thus , the transition takes place somewhat earlier in the lighter nuclei xe , ba , ce , and nd , somewhat later in sm and gd , and at the same isotope @xmath63 in dy . nevertheless , the important point is the shape - change tendency taking place before the closed shell at @xmath9 , which is a general feature of the isotopic shape evolution .",
    "the exact isotope where the transition takes place is not very relevant because the shape transition region is naturally characterized by very close energies in the prolate and oblate sector competing to each other to be ground states .",
    "thus , small details of the calculations can change the energies and shift the ground state from one shape to another .",
    "another odd effect observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] is the presence of a little kink in the quadrupole deformations at @xmath68 in nd and sm isotopes .",
    "this kink is related to a subtle effect that appears at mid - shell in these nuclei , where the tendency changes and the equilibrium deformation starts decreasing with increasing neutron number . looking in detail into the energy - deformation curves obtained from constrained hf+bcs calculations , one finds out that this behavior is related to the topology of the curves in the prolate minimum .",
    "whereas the minimum up to @xmath60 is rather sharp , at @xmath68 it becomes shallower with the absolute minimum at a somewhat larger value @xmath69 . at @xmath70",
    "the prolate minimum is also rather shallow , but slightly peaked at a lower @xmath71 .",
    "after that , it continuously decreases with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "it is hard to find a simple explanation for this rare behavior that is related to a very subtle competition between the single - particle energies and their crossing as a function of deformation in these isotopes .",
    "the effect might also depend on the particular version of the skyrme interaction used ( sly4 in this case ) .    in the next figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bgt ] ) the accumulated gt strength , that is , the gt strength contained up to a given excitation energy , is plotted as a function of the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus .",
    "a quenching factor 0.77 has been included in the results .",
    "the figures cover the energy range below the @xmath72 energy , which is the relevant region for the calculation of the half - lives .",
    "only the results for the lighter unstable isotopes are shown because they offer better possibilities to be measured .",
    "vertical arrows indicate the experimental @xmath72 energies @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution of the gt strength is fundamental to constrain the underlying nuclear structure involved in the calculation of the the half - lives .",
    "the decay rates in astrophysical scenarios may however , be different from the decay rates in the laboratory because the phase factors may be also different .",
    "therefore , to describe properly the decay rates under extreme conditions of density and temperature , it is not sufficient to reproduce the half - lives in the laboratory .",
    "one needs , in addition , to have a reliable description of the gt strength distributions @xcite .",
    "the different profiles observed for the prolate an oblate nuclear shapes is a typical example of the sensitivity of the gt strength distribution to deformation .",
    "this sensitivity is translated into the @xmath0-decay half - lives . in the heavier isotopes",
    "ce , nd , sm , and gd , the oblate shapes generate more gt strength than the prolate ones at low excitation energies and as a result , the oblate shapes produce shorter half - lives .",
    "experimental information on these strength distributions will be very valuable to constrain further the nuclear structure calculations .",

    "<S> in this paper , @xmath0-decay properties of even - even neutron - rich isotopes in the rare - earth mass region are studied within a microscopic theoretical approach based on a proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mean field is constructed selfconsistently from a deformed hartree - fock calculation with skyrme interactions and pairing correlations to which particle - hole and particle - particle residual interactions are added . </S>",
    "<S> nuclei in this mass region participate in the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process and are directly involved in the generation of the rare - earth peak in the isotopic abundance pattern centered at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distributions of the gamow - teller strength as well as the @xmath0-decay half - lives and the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities are discussed and compared with the available experimental information and with calculations based on different approaches . </S>"
