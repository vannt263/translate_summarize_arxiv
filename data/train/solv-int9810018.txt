    "this paper is devoted to the time discretization of a famous integrable system of classical mechanics  the lagrange top .",
    "this is a special case of rotation of a rigid body around a fixed point in a homogenious gravitational field , characterized by the following conditions : the rigid body is rotationally symmetric , i.e. two of its three principal moments of inertia coincide , and the fixed point lies on the axis of rotational symmetry .",
    "we present a discretization preserving the integrability property , and discuss its rich mechanical and geometrical structure . notice that until recently @xcite only the integrable euler case of the rigid body motion was discretized preserving integrability @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consult also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some fundamental early papers on the subject of integrable discretizations , and @xcite , @xcite for reviews of this topic reflecting the viewpoints of the present authors and containing extensive bibliography .",
    "we found the standard presentation of the lagrange top in mechanical textbooks insufficient in several respects , and therefore chose to write this paper in a pedagogical manner , giving a systematic account of the new results along with the well known ones represented in a form suitable for our present purposes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction recalls the classical euler ",
    "poinsot equations for the motion of the spinning top in the frame moving with the body .",
    "further , we give less known euler ",
    "poinsot equations describing the lagrange top in the rest frame ( they can not be directly generalized to a general top case ) .",
    "we finish the introduction by announcing a beautiful time discretization of the latter equations .    in order to derive this discretization systematically , we need some formalism of discrete time lagrangian mechanics on lie groups .",
    "the discrete time lagrangian mechanics were introduced by veselov @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite , but the case of lie groups have certain specific features which , in our opinion , were not worked out sufficiently . in particular , there lacks a systematic account of the discrete time version of the lagrangian reduction ( which is fairly well understood in the continuous time setting , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . also , we think that some technical details in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite could be amended : in working with variational equations these authors systematically use lagrange multipliers instead of introducing proper notions such as lie derivatives ( specific for lie groups as opposed to general manifolds ) . therefore we give a detailed exposition of the discrete time lagrangian mechanics on lie groups in sect .",
    "3 . in order to underline an absolute parallelism of its structure with that of the continuous time lagrangian mechanics",
    ", we included in sect . 2 also a presentation of ( a fragment of ) the latter , which is , of course , by no means original .",
    "4 is devoted to a lagrangian derivation of equations of motion of the lagrange top , both in the rest and in the body frames . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we do the same work for a discrete time lagrange top .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the actual motivation for the present development came from differential geometry , more precisely , from the theory of elastic curves .",
    "a brief account of the relations between spinning tops and elastic curves is given in sect .",
    "we also give three appendices .",
    "appendix a is for fixing the notations of lie group theory . in the appendix",
    "b we collect the main results of sect . 2 , 3 in the form of an easy  to  use table .",
    "finally , appendix c contains some conventions and simple technical results on a specific lie group we work with , namely on @xmath0 .",
    "it should be remarked here that our experience with various integrable discretizations convinced us that working with this group has many advantages when compared to the group @xmath1 , more traditional in this context .",
    "a standard form of equations of motion describing rotation of a rigid body around a fixed point in a homogeneous gravity field is the following : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the vector of kinetic momentum of the body , expressed in the so called body frame .",
    "this frame is firmly attached to the body , its origin is in the body s fixed point , and its axes coincide with the principal inertia axes of the body .",
    "the inertia tensor of the body in this frame is diagonal : @xmath4 for the vector @xmath5 of the angular velocity we have : @xmath6 the vector @xmath7 is the unit vector along the gravity field , with respect to the body frame .",
    "finally , @xmath8 is the vector pointing from the fixed point to the center of mass of the body .",
    "it is a constant vector in the body frame .",
    "it is well known that the system ( [ lt body ] ) is hamiltonian with respect to the lie ",
    "poisson bracket of the lie algebra @xmath9 of the lie group @xmath10 of euclidean motions of @xmath11 , i.e. with respect to the poisson bracket @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sign of the permutation @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian equations of motion for an arbitrary hamilton function @xmath16 in the bracket ( [ e3 br body ] ) read : @xmath17 which coincides with ( [ lt body ] ) if @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 stands for the standard euclidean scalar product in @xmath11 ) . the poisson bracket ( [ e3 br body ] )",
    "has two casimir functions , @xmath20 which are therefore integrals of motion for ( [ lt body ] ) in involution with @xmath21 ( and with any other function on the phase space ) .    the lagrange case of the rigid body motion ( the lagrange top , for brevity ) , is characterized by the following data : @xmath22 , which means that the body is rotationally symmetric with respect to the third coordinate axis ) , and @xmath23 , which means that the fixed point lies on the symmetry axis .",
    "choosing units properly , we may assume that @xmath24 the system ( [ lt body ] ) has in this case an additional integral of motion , @xmath25 which is also in involution with @xmath21 , and assures therefore the complete integrability of the flow ( [ lt body ] ) .",
    "for an actual integration of this flow in terms of elliptic functions see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and for a more modern account @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "remarkable as it is , this result is , however , somewhat unsatisfying from the practical point of view .",
    "indeed , one is usually interested in describing the motion of the top in the rest frame , which does not move in the physical space .",
    "it is less known that for the lagrange top the corresponding equations of motion are also very nice and , actually , even somewhat simpler than ( [ lt body ] ) : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the vector of kinetic momentum of the body , expressed in the rest frame , @xmath28 is the unit vector along the gravity field , also expressed in the rest frame , so that it becomes constant : @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the vector pointing from the fixed point to the center of mass , expressed in the rest frame .",
    "an exterior observer is mainly interested in the motion of the symmetry axis of the top , which is described by the vector @xmath31 .",
    "the system ( [ lt rest ] ) has several remarkable features .",
    "first of all , it does not depend explicitly on the anisotropy parameter @xmath32 of the inertia tensor .",
    "second , it is hamiltonian with respect to the lie ",
    "poisson bracket of @xmath9 : @xmath33 for an arbitrary hamilton function @xmath34 , the hamiltonian equations of motion in this bracket read : @xmath35 these equations coincide with ( [ lt rest ] ) , if @xmath36 of course , the functions @xmath37 are casimirs of the bracket ( [ e3 br rest ] ) , and therefore are integrals of motion for ( [ lt rest ] ) in involution with @xmath38 ( and with any other function on the phase space ) .",
    "an additional integral of motion in involution with @xmath38 , assuring the complete integrability of the system ( [ lt rest ] ) , is : @xmath39    in the main text we give a lagrangian derivation of equations of motion ( [ lt body ] ) and ( [ lt rest ] ) and an explanation of their hamiltonian nature and integrability .",
    "then we present a discrete lagrangian function generating two maps approximating ( [ lt body ] ) and ( [ lt rest ] ) , respectively .",
    "most beautiful is the discretization of ( [ lt rest ] ) : @xmath40 it is easy to see that the second equation in ( [ dlt rest ] ) can be uniquely solved for @xmath41 , so that ( [ dlt rest ] ) defines a map @xmath42 , approximating , for small @xmath43 , the time @xmath43 shift along the trajectories of ( [ lt rest ] ) .",
    "this distinguishes the situation from the one in @xcite where lagrangian equations led to correspondences rather than to maps .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the map ( [ dlt rest ] ) is poisson with respect to the bracket ( [ e3 br rest ] ) , so that the casimirs ( [ e3 cas rest ] ) are integrals of motion .",
    "it is also obvious that ( [ m3 rest ] ) is an integral of motion .",
    "most remarkably , this map has another integral of motion  an analog of the hamiltonian : @xmath44 the function ( [ h eps rest ] ) is in involution with ( [ m3 rest ] ) , which renders the map ( [ dlt rest ] ) completely integrable .",
    "a similar discretization for the equations of motion in the body frame ( [ lt body ] ) is slightly less elegant .",

    "a _ discrete elastic rod _ is a framed curve for which the evolution of @xmath489 under a linear combination of flows @xmath491 with some @xmath69 is a rigid skrew  motion , so that the evolution of @xmath484 under the flow @xmath492 is a rigid rotation .    in other words ,",

    "it remains to find a variational problem generating the equations of motion ( [ dsecond ] ) .",

    "we took an opportunity of elaborating an integrable discretization of the lagrange top to study in a considerable detail the general theory of discrete time lagrangian mechanics on lie groups .",
    "we consider this theory as an important source of symplectic and , more general , poisson maps . moreover , from some points of view the variational ( lagrangian ) structure is even more fundamental and important than the poisson ( hamiltonian ) one ( cf .",

    "futher , the discrete time dynamics should be integrated in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the methods of the finite  gap theory will be useful here @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be important to elaborate a variational interpretation of different integrable discretizations of the euler top found in @xcite .",
