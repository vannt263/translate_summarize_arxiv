    "during the last decade , models for the formation and evolution of planetary systems have been developed significantly .",
    "early stages of planetary system formation have been studied by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observational properties of the early stages of planetary and substellar companion formation and evolution are poorly understood .",
    "authors mainly analyse the possibility to identify the signatures of a planet s formation with the best available techniques , such as alma  atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and iram plateau de bure interferometer ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent alma observations of hl  tau  @xcite and hw  hya  @xcite very likely show that planetary formation is ongoing in the discs of these systems .",
    "the selection of a good target for observations is not a trivial task and it would be very useful to know the indicators that forming companions may leave in other more numerous observational methods , such as spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which are already available for many systems with protoplanetary discs .",
    "there are very few publications dedicated to this topic to date . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that a presence of hot and massive ( 32  64  @xmath1 ) fragments  proto - brown dwarfs during the first few 10,000 years  initiate an additional peak in seds at 5  10  @xmath3 m .",
    "@xcite , considered the example of a 2 jupiter mass planet on a very close orbit to the star , and found that seds from discs with gaps may not only have a reduced emission at @xmath5  @xmath3 m due to the removal of the emission from the gap , but also may have a measurable excess emission at longer wavelengths ( @xmath6  @xmath3 m ) , that rises from the heating of the vertical disc wall at the outer edge of the gap .",
    "@xcite show that discs with massive planets lose the near infrared excess after a few myrs and their seds look like true transition discs , while seds of the discs with less massive planets look like pre - transition disc seds for most of their remaining lifetimes .",
    "there is a sufficient number of observational studies that contain large samples of observed seds of the systems with protoplanetary discs .",
    "for example , a recent paper of @xcite contains a large sample of observational seds ( @xmath4200 systems with transition discs ) , and @xmath470@xmath7 of these discs , most probably , contain large cavities and holes .",
    "these might be cleared by a planetary or a substellar companion or be a result of another physical process , like grain growth ( e.g. @xcite ) or photoevaporative clearing ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper , we concentrate on the gaps cleared by one companion and analyse the possibility to detect signatures of the presence of a substellar or planetary companion in a protoplanetary disc based on sed profiles and also the possibility to determine the companion s parameters and the physical conditions of the disc when the presence of a companion is most evident .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the modeling approach and basic equations are briefly described in section  [ algorithm ] .",
    "the results and analysis are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] contains the conclusions of the paper .",
    "to calculate seds from the systems with protoplanetary discs and brown dwarf companions , we assume that the total flux from the system ( @xmath8 ) is the sum of the fluxes from the central star ( @xmath9 ) , the disc ( @xmath10 ) and the companion ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 .",
    "fluxes from the star and the companion are calculated using a black - body approximation :    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a distance to the object , @xmath16 is the plank function , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the stellar radius and effective temperature , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the companion s radius and effective temperature .",
    "the stellar and companion s physical parameters are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and are summarised in table  [ tlab ] .      to calculate the contribution to the sed from the protoplanetary disc , we assume that the companion is moving along a circular orbit and that there is no material inside the gap .",
    "the flux from the disc is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the flux from the disc , as it would be without the gap opened by the companion , and @xmath23 is a flux from the part of the disc that has been cleared by the companion .",
    "we use the solution to the one - dimensional radiative transfer equation to calculate the protoplanetary disc flux density with the frequency @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath15 is a distance to the system from the sun , @xmath27 is the radial distance from the central object , @xmath28 is the planck function for a radius - dependent temperature , @xmath29 , of the disc , @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the inner and outer radii of the disc , respectively , @xmath32 represents the dust grain emission efficiency , @xmath33 stands for the optical depth of the disc material , which is the product of the wavelength - dependent disc opacity , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the radial surface density distribution of the disc material . to calculate the wavelength - dependent disc opacity",
    ", we use the mie theory and consider compact spherical grains composed of astronomical silicates , a density of 2.5  g@xmath36@xmath37 , grain sizes between 0.1 and 100  @xmath3 m and gas to dust mass ratio of 100 .    radial temperature and surface density distributions we assume to be power laws : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for computations we used @xmath40 = -0.5 and",
    "@xmath41 = -1.5 .",
    "the effect of @xmath40 variation on the resulting sed profile is discussed in details in subsection  [ vs_disc ] .",
    "the disc surface density as a function of the disc mass is described by the equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a total mass of the disc .",
    "the flux from the part of the disc that has been cleared by the companion , @xmath23 , is calculated using the same approach as @xmath22 , except only in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 , which are the gap inner and outer radii .",
    "these radii are determined by the distance to the star from the companion , @xmath46 , and the hill radius @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are masses of the companion and of the star , respectively .",
    "we neglect the additional heating from the companion to the inner and outer edges of the disc gap . as discussed in detail in appendix  [ additional heat ] , the maximum temperature to which the brown dwarf companion could heat the inner and outer sides of the disc gap is comparable , or much smaller , to the disc temperature to which it is been heated by the central star .",
    "we simulated synthetic seds for a system with a 0.8  @xmath0 central object and a 30  @xmath1 substellar companion with an age of 5  myr .",
    "the mass of the companion we chose based on the limitation from the previous study of @xcite , that shows that the maximum mass of the object that can form via gravitational instability in a protostellar disc is @xmath51 .",
    "table  [ tlab ] summarizes stellar and companion physical parameters that were used to compute the sed .",
    "the sed for the protoplanetary disc was modeled for @xmath30 = @xmath52 ( in our particular case @xmath52 = 0.02  au = 4.7  @xmath17 ) and @xmath31 = 400  au .",
    "we consider a passive disc and assume there is no material inside the gap , and the companion is moving along circular orbit .",
    "we further assume that the width of the gap is one diameter of the hill sphere , so we consider the minimum possible gap cleared by a companion of a given mass .    we do nt account for an increase of the emission temperature from the part of the outer edge of the gap that is directly exposed to stellar radiation since its contribution would be very small .",
    "for example , if a gap has been cleared by a companion at 1  au , the total area that is not covered by the inner edge of the gap is @xmath53  au@xmath54 at the distance 1.23  au .",
    "however if the disc has a non - zero inclination , the addition flux from the outer edge of the gap would be more noticeable . in that case , the radiation from this part of the disc would be directly exposed to the observer and then even a small change of the temperature may cause a noticeable change of the flux .",
    "this will be studied in a subsequent paper with more detailed disc structure and radiative transfer simulations ."
