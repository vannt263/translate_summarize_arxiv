    "the mgii @xmath6 absorption doublets are commonly seen in photo - ionized gas of temperature @xmath7 k ( bergeron & stasnska 1986 ; charlton et al .  2003 ) and in high - column density clouds of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath8  ( rao et al .",
    "while mgii absorbers are observed to arise in outflowing gas along the lines of sight directly into star - forming regions ( e.g.  weiner @xmath3  2009 ; martin & bouch 2009 ; rubin @xmath3  2010 ) , it is unclear whether the absorbers found at projected distances beyond @xmath9 kpc from star - forming regions are primarily due to outflows , infalling clouds , or a combination thereof ( c.f .",

    "the large wavelengths of the doublet transitions , together with recently available uv sensitive spectrographs on the ground , allow us to examine in detail the physical connections between the cool gas probed by mgii absorption features and galaxies routinely found at redshifts as low as @xmath10 ( e.g.  barton & cooke 2009 ; h .-",
    "w.chen @xmath3  2010 ) . using a sample of 94 random galaxies at @xmath11 and @xmath12 kpc from the line of sight of a background qso , h .- w .",
    "chen @xmath3  ( 2010 ; hereafter c10 ) examined how the incidence and extent of mgii absorbers depends on galaxy properties .",
    "they confirmed that the rest - frame absorption equivalent widths of mgii absorbers , , decline with increasing projected distances from the galaxies , and found that the extent of mgii absorbing gas , @xmath4 , depends sensitively on the galaxy @xmath13-band luminosity following @xmath14 kpc , but not on the rest - frame @xmath15 color or redshift .",
    "the lack of correlation between  and @xmath15 color suggests a lack of physical connection between the observed mgii absorbing gas and the recent star formation history of the galaxies .",
    "it is therefore challenging to attribute the majority of mgii absorbers found at large galactic radii ( @xmath0 kpc ) to starburst - driven outflows .",
    "however , the strong scaling relation between @xmath4 and galaxy @xmath13-band luminosity , while interesting , is difficult to interpret .",
    "although it has been shown that @xmath16 scales with halo mass @xmath17 ( e.g.  x.  yang @xmath3  2005 ; tinker @xmath3  2007 ; z.  zheng @xmath3  2007 ) , @xmath16 is also found to correlate with [ oii ] luminosity despite showing a large scatter ( g.  zhu @xmath3  2009 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath16 is a better tracer of halo mass or on - going star formation .",
    "here we supplement the galaxy data published in c10 with new measurements of total stellar mass @xmath1 ( a more robust tracer of dark matter halo mass , e.g.  more @xmath3  2010 ) , emission line strength @xmath2 , and specific star formation rate @xmath18 of the galaxies .",
    "these empirical quantities allow us to investigate possible correlations between on - going star formation , galaxy mass , and absorber strength , and to identify whether on - going star formation rate or halo mass is the dominant factor in determining the incidence and extent of mgii absorbing gas at large galactic radii .",
    "we adopt a @xmath19 cosmology , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath22 throughout the paper .",
    "in order to derive @xmath1 and ssfr for each galaxy in our sample , we follow the maximum likelihood method now routinely adopted to extract galaxy properties from wide - field survey data ( kauffmann @xmath3  2003 ; brinchmann @xmath3  2004 ; salim @xmath3  2005 ; walcher @xmath32008 ) .",
    "the basic principle is to calculate the @xmath23 between a set of galaxy observables and equivalent model - galaxy predictions .",
    "the predictions are derived from a suite of stellar population synthesis models designed to cover the full range in physical properties of the observed galaxies ( e.g.  age , star formation history , metallicity , dust content etc . ) .",
    "the benefit of this methodology over traditional methods of fitting a small number of model templates , is in the calculation of a full probability distribution function ( pdf ) for each physical property , which for a set of observables attempts to account for any degeneracy between derived properties . in turn , this provides a robust error estimate for each derived property .",
    "the disadvantages are that the method relies heavily upon the accuracy of stellar population synthesis models , and can be somewhat dependent on the prior distribution of physical properties assumed when creating the library of model - galaxies .",
    "stellar population models have advanced greatly in the last decade , with the development of new empirical and theoretical stellar libraries and stellar evolutionary tracks ( e.g.  bruzual 2010 ) .",
    "results using different model priors have also been compared and contrasted ( e.g.  pozzetti @xmath3  2007 ) .",
    "overall , the concensus is that @xmath1 and ssfr ( which in the model is the mean sfr averaged over the last 10 myr , divided by @xmath1 ) can be robustly determined , but may suffer from systematic offsets ( by as much as a factor of two ) between the adoption of different population synthesis models , initial - mass - functions and star formation history ( sfh ) priors .",
    "the library of models used in this study is described in detail in da cunha @xmath3  ( 2008 ) . in summary ,",
    "the stellar population models are based on those described in bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) revised to include a new prescription for the tp - agb evolution of low and intermediate mass stars ( marigo & girardi 2007 ) .",
    "the sfh of the library of model galaxies is parameterized by two components ( kauffmann @xmath3  2003 ) : an underlying exponentially declining sfh characterized by an age and decline timescale , and superimposed random bursts .",
    "the metallicity of the models is distributed uniformly between 0.02 and 2 times solar .",
    "the stellar continuum light is attenuated according to the two - component dust model of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) . for each model - galaxy in our library",
    "we calculate observed - frame colors at redshifts uniformly distributed between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with a spacing of @xmath26 .",
    "all the galaxies in our sample are observed by the sdss ( york @xmath32000 ) and have @xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 photometry . to obtain accurate colors we use fixed aperture magnitudes with radii equal to the petrosian radius in the r - band .",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction . to identify the best - fit stellar population model for each observed galaxy ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath23 between the observed optical colors and derived values of the set of model galaxies at the appropriate redshift .",
    "we are able to constrain @xmath1 and ssfr for all but three galaxies in the sample .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the distribution of derived @xmath1 versus ssfr is shown in the left panel of figure 1 , along with the best - fit correlation of the blue - sequence galaxies from salim @xmath3  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the errorbars represent the 68% confidence interval of the pdf around the best - fit values .",
    "we find that while the uncertainties of the ssfr are large , our galaxies occupy a parameter space consistent with what is seen in random field galaxies , including the blue - sequence marked by the solid line and the red galaxy population underneath it and ssfr remain unchanged within the errors , when we include in the model analysis available near - ir colors from the ukidss survey ( lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) and available @xmath32 . because these measurements are not available for all galaxies , we do not include them for consistency . ] .",
    "in addition to the broad - band photometric colors , we measure the rest - frame  emission equivalent width , @xmath2 , using available galaxy spectra from c10 instead of  line fluxes , because the spectra have not been corrected for aperture or differential slit losses . ] .",
    "@xmath2 measures the on - going star formation rate relative to the past average ( e.g.  lee @xmath3  2009 ) , and provides an independent , empirical estimate of the ssfr .",

    "a comparison between panels ( c ) through ( f ) suggests that the observed mgii absorber strengths depend on galaxy @xmath13-band magnitude and total stellar mass , but do not depend on ssfr or @xmath2 . ]",

    "roughly 20% of the galaxies with @xmath40 in this sample have @xmath15 color consistent with elliptical or s0 .",
    "no clear trend is seen between @xmath41 and @xmath15 .        including new measurements of @xmath1 , ssfr , and @xmath32 , we present the residuals of the  vs.  @xmath39 anti - correlation ( panel a of figure 2 ) versus @xmath38 , @xmath42 , ssfr , and @xmath2 in panels ( c)(f ) of figure 2 , respectively . inspecting the residuals versus different galaxy properties , we find that qualitatively the observed mgii absorber strengths depend sensitively on @xmath38 and @xmath1 , but not on ssfr or @xmath2 .",
    "we also perform the likelihood analysis described in c10 , in order to quantify the best - fit correlation between  and different galaxy properties in the presence of non - detections in the mgii features . adopting a power - law model , @xmath43 we seek the best - fit coefficients , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 that minimize the scatter in the  versus @xmath39 anti - correlation .",

    "we find that , similar to @xmath38 , including @xmath1 indeed improves the scatter found in the  vs.  @xmath39 anti - correlation , although the @xmath42-corrected relation exhibits a somewhat larger scatter . at the same time",
    ", the lack of a systematic trend between the residuals and ssfr suggests that ssfr has little impact on the extended mgii absorbing gas at large galactic radii .    assigning @xmath53",
    ", we find that the mgii gaseous extent scales with @xmath39 and ssfr following @xmath54 and @xmath55 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the best - fit coefficients lead to @xmath56 at fixed , suggesting that galaxies with higher ssfr possess more extended mgii absorbing gas .",
    "the best - fit model has an associated intrinsic scatter of @xmath57 and a r.m.s .",
    "residual between the observed and model mgii absorber strengths of @xmath58 .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure 3 shows that the remaining scatter in the ssfr - corrected  vs.  @xmath39 anti - correlation is large and there exists an apparent systematic trend between the residuals of the mean relation and @xmath1 as indicated by different symbols in the panel .    combining the results shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure 3",
    ", we find that the scatter in the observed  vs.  @xmath39 anti - correlation is driven primarily by @xmath1 of the galaxies .",
    "however , the remaining scatter is still somewhat larger than what is seen after accounting for the scaling relation with galaxy @xmath13-band luminosity ( panel b of figure 2 ) , implying that @xmath38 is a more successful than @xmath1 in determining the extent of mgii absorbing gas .",
    "to understand the difference , we examine the correlation between @xmath1 , @xmath38 , and ssfr in panel ( c ) of figure 3 .",

    "we find that including both @xmath1 and ssfr reproduces the strong anti - correlation determined using @xmath38 seen in panel ( b ) of figure 2 .",
    "our analysis shows that the extent of mgii absorbing gas depends strongly on @xmath1 and more weakly on ssfr , following @xmath65 .",
    "the strong dependence of  on @xmath38 ( c10 ) is understood as @xmath38 being an integrated measure of @xmath1 and ssfr in galaxies .",
    "the empirical data demand a scaling relation that includes both @xmath1 and ssfr , with @xmath1 being a more dominant factor .",
    "a tight correlation is found between @xmath1 and halo mass ( e.g.  more @xmath3  2010 ) .",
    "the strong dependence between @xmath4 and @xmath1 is naturally explained , if mgii absorbers arise in infalling clouds and more massive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas ( e.g.  mo & miralda - escud 1996 ; maller & bullock 2004 ; tinker & chen 2008 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and mgii absorbers along common sightlines allows an empirical characterization of halo gaseous radius versus halo mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are two possible interpretations of the additional scaling relation between @xmath4 and ssfr .",
    "the first scenario is that mgii absorbing gas is produced in wind - blown materials that , around galaxies of the same mass , can reach to larger distances at higher sfr .",
    "likewise , around galaxies of the same sfr outflows can reach to larger distances in lower - mass halos . in this scenario ,",
    "the gas contents of extended halos around galaxies are regulated by both accretion and outflows , however , accretion remains the dominant process .",
    "alternatively , we consider the inverse correlation between ssfr and @xmath1 commonly seen in field galaxies over a broad redshift range that has been studied ( e.g.  figure 1 ; salim @xmath3  2007 ; x .-",
    "z.zheng @xmath3  2007 ; y .- m .",
    "chen @xmath3  2009 ) .",
    "more massive galaxies on average exhibit lower ssfr .",
    "in particular , red galaxies show an overall much reduced rate of star formation in comparison to the blue - sequence galaxies , suggesting a suppressed gas supply around these red galaxies ( e.g.  schiminovich @xmath3  2007 ) . instead of gaseous halos being enriched with starburst driven outflows , the additional scaling relation between @xmath4 and ssfr in equation ( 2 ) can therefore be understood as due to an increasingly suppressed cool gas supply around higher - mass galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "mgii absorbers serve as a direct measure of gas supply around galaxies .    the physical processes that produce the bi - modality of red and blue galaxies and the tilt of the ssfr@xmath1 relation in the blue sequence remain uncertain .",
    "while it is generally understood that sfr follows the net accretion rate of cool gas ( e.g.  birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere @xmath3  2005 , 2009 ) , achieving galaxy bi - modality in simulations using feedback , mergers etc .",
    "does not necessarily reproduce the time - evolution of the ssfr-@xmath1 relation for the blue sequence galaxies ( e.g.  dav 2008 ; bouch @xmath3  2010 ) .",
    "if observations of mgii absorbers around galaxies give a direct measure of how the cool halo gas content varies with galaxy mass , a comparison study of the mgii gaseous extent around red- and blue - sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint for resolving the physical origin of the observed ssfr@xmath1 relation in galaxies .",
    "finally , we note the remaining large scatter in the  vs.  @xmath39 anti - correlation after accounting for the differences in @xmath42 and ssfr . given the range of @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 , and ssfr covered by the galaxy sample , it is not clear whether any single physical mechanism can explain such scatter for the entire sample .",
    "c10 attributed such scatter to poisson noise in the number of cool clumps intercepted along a line of sight . under a clumpy halo scenario",
    ", we can begin to constrain the size and mass of individual clumps based on known properties of mgii absorbers .",
