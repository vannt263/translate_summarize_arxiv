    "the dominant interaction in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) realized so far , is the contact interaction . in the ultracold regime , this interaction is isotropic and short range .",
    "recently , increasing theoretical interest has focused on the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "this interaction is long range and anisotropic and thus would greatly enrich the physics of degenerate quantum gases . additionally , tuning of this interaction from attraction to repulsion is possible by applying time dependent external fields @xcite .",
    "together with the use of a feshbach resonance to vary the s - wave scattering length this would allow control of the scattering properties of an ultracold sample over a wide range of values and characteristics .",
    "a promising candidate for the observation of the influence of the dipole - dipole interaction on the dynamics of a bec is atomic chromium @xcite . due to its comparably large magnetic dipole moment of 6@xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the bohr magneton ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is of the same order of magnitude as the contact interaction .",
    "however , many of the effects proposed for dipolar gases @xcite require a much stronger dipole - dipole interaction . magnetic dipole moments or electric dipole moments aligned in external fields that lead to such strong dipolar interaction can be found in heteronuclear molecules . the strongly paramagnetic cr - rb - molecule , is thus expected to have a large electric dipole moment beside its magnetic moment .",
    "in addition , the generation of degenerate gases of ultracold cr - rb - molecules formed by two ultracold gases of cr and rb which are each produced by laser cooling and subsequent sympathetic cooling @xcite seems to be feasible .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a short description of our experimental setup , we present our findings on photoionization of the excited rb@xmath8 .",
    "measurements concerning interspecies collisions can be found in the subsequent section followed by our conclusions .",
    "as a first step , on the way to the generation of ultracold , heteronuclear molecules , we have realized a two species magneto - optical trap for chromium and rubidium atoms . for our measurement",
    "we prepare both mots in the quadrupol field of two coils oriented in anti - helmholtz configuration .",
    "each trap is formed by three orthogonal and retro - reflected trapping laser beams , with the typical @xmath9-polarization .",
    "the trapping beams of the two traps are tilted by a small angle with respect to each other to be able to set up separate optics for both traps .",
    "we load about @xmath10 bosonic @xmath0cr - atoms from a high temperature effusion cell via a zeeman - slower into the cr - mot .",
    "the 426 nm cooling light is generated by a frequency doubled ti : sa - laser .",
    "the rb - mot with a steady state atom number of about @xmath11 rb - atoms is loaded from the rb - background gas provided by a continuously operated rb - getter source .",
    "the stabilized rb - cooling and repumping lasers are provided via a fiber from a different experimental setup .",
    "both frequencies separated by 6.8ghz are amplified by a single laser diode using injection locking technique .",
    "when both traps are operated at the same time , the steady state number of rb atoms @xmath12 drops by a factor of 5 due to photoionization of the excited rb - cooling state .",
    "photoionization of a neutral atom is a transition from a bound state @xmath13 with internal energy @xmath14 to a continuum state @xmath15 .",
    "such a transition becomes possible if the energy @xmath16 of an incident photon exceeds the ionization - energy @xmath17 of the bound state @xmath13 .",
    "the transition rate @xmath18 is given by fermi s golden rule : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transition matrix element of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the density of states in the continuum at the final energy @xmath23 .",
    "the photoionization rate can also be expressed using the photoionization cross - section @xmath24 if we define the photon - flux @xmath25 using the intensity @xmath26 of the ionizing light with a frequency of @xmath27 : @xmath28     trap on the population @xmath29 of the excited 5p@xmath5 state at an intensity of the ionizing laser of 100mw / cm@xmath3 .",

    "the ionization energy of the excited state is 2.6ev ( 479 nm ) .",
    "thus , if we apply the cr cooling laser ( 426 nm ) in the rb - mot , transitions of excited rb@xmath8 atoms to continuum states become possible .",
    "this situation is displayed in figure [ pischeme ] . during the process ,",
    "energy and momentum are conserved and the excess energy is distributed among the electron and the ion leading to a velocity of the electron of @xmath34 m/s . therefore , recombination within the trap volume is very unlikely .",
    "ions and electrons are not supported by the trap .",
    "this additional loss contributes to the total one - body loss rate , which reads @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the loss rate induced by the ionization and @xmath32 represents all other one body losses which are mainly caused by background gas collisions . as the ionization occurs in the excited state , the ionization rate @xmath37 has to be multiplied with the population probability @xmath38 of the excited state : @xmath39 @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the saturation parameter expressed by the average clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath42 , @xmath43 the natural linewidth and @xmath44mw / cm@xmath3 the saturation intensity of the rb trapping transition in a light field with total intensity @xmath45 and detuning @xmath46 .    neglecting two and three - body losses , which is a good approximation for the low densities we observe in our trap",
    ", the time evolution of the atom number @xmath47 in the rubidium trap can be described by the following well known rate equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the loading rate .",

    "the mean value of these photoionization cross sections of the @xmath59 state of @xmath1rb at a wavelength of 426 nm is : @xmath60 this value is in good agreement with previously published values @xcite at comparable wavelengths and with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "in the second part of this article , we investigate the inelastic trap losses in combined cr - rb traps . during an interspecies collision in the presence of cooling light , each atom ( cr and rb ) undergoes several transitions from the ground to the excited state .",
    "if the atoms approach each other they experience a molecular potential . for ground state atoms the long - range part of this potential",
    "is dominated by the attractive van - der - waals potential @xmath61 , where r is the internuclear distance . based on a two level model schlder",
    "@xcite pointed out , that this part of the molecular potential does not change its dependence on r if one of the atoms is in the excited state @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 coefficient leads to an attractive ( repulsive ) interaction , if the excited atom has the smaller ( larger ) transition frequency of both the atoms .",
    "since @xmath63 is always larger than @xmath64 , the excited state potential is steeper .",
    "this has two consequences for cr - rb collisions :    first , inelastic collisions involving the excited state of @xmath65 are prevented , because the steep , repulsive excited state potential hinders the two species to get very close to each other .",
    "second , in contrast to homonuclear collisions , where the potential @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 , in the heteronuclear case , the colliding atoms decouple from the light field at smaller internuclear distances .",
    "this leads to a higher survival probability @xcite , which means that the two atoms can approach each other in the rb@xmath8-cr - potential to a internuclear distance where fine structure changing collisions ( fc ) and radiative escape ( re ) lead to trap losses .",
    "since loss due to photoionization of excited rb - atoms triggered by the cr - trapping light and loss due to cr - light induced two - body collisions in the cr - mot @xcite are dominant in both mots , it was not possible to observe trap loss due to interspecies collisions during the simultaneous operation of these traps .",
    "however , because of the 6 times larger magnetic moment of cr we are able to prepare a magnetically trapped ( mt ) cloud of cr - atoms and study the interaction with magneto - optically trapped rb - atoms in the absence of the cr - cooling light .",
    "as explained above , in a combined mot for cr and rb we do not expect excited cr atoms to contribute to the inelastic loss coefficient , therefore , the measured @xmath68-coefficient for inelastic collisions in the overlapped mt for cr and mot for rb should be very similar to a coefficient measured while both mots are operated simultaneously .    for this measurement , we magnetically trap about @xmath69 @xmath0cr - atoms at @xmath70k in the @xmath71s@xmath72 ground state using the continuous loading scheme presented by stuhler et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the mt potential is created by the same coil configuration as described in the previous section . during the measurements the field gradient in the direction of the coil axis is @xmath73g / cm . assuming a cut off parameter of @xmath74 this results in a calculated magnetic trap depth of @xmath75@xmath76k for cr - atoms in the extreme zeeman substate @xcite .",
    "we then apply the rb cooling and repumping light for a certain interaction time @xmath77 to load the rb - mot .",
    "the temperature of the rb cloud is about @xmath78k .",
    "the light forces in the rb - mot result in a much deeper trapping potential of approximately @xmath79k . after the interaction time @xmath77 the fluorescence of either the rb - cloud or of the resonantly illuminated cr - atoms is imaged onto a calibrated ccd - camera while no near resonant light is applied to the other species .",
    "the number of atoms of the imaged species is calculated from the pixel count of the image .",
    "we perform a series of such measurements in which we record the evolution of the number of cr - atoms @xmath80 and rb - atoms @xmath47 .",

    "the temperature of the rb - atoms is deduced from the ballistic expansion of the cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : zerfall_cr ] illustrates the decay of the number of magnetically trapped cr - atoms during the first 30s with and without trapped rb - atoms being present . neglecting two - body loss , a fit of a one - body decay without trapped rb - atoms present yields a lifetime of 10s . in the presence of the rb - mot",

    "the additional loss channel introduced by magnetically trapped cr - atoms can be clearly observed .    the decay of the number of magnetically trapped cr - atoms @xmath80 and the increase of magneto - optically trapped rb - atoms @xmath47 during loading in the presence of the other species is governed by the following coupled rate equations : @xmath85 because of the different loss channels of the two types of traps , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not expected to be equal .",
    "the integral over both density distributions in the interspecies collision term can be approximated by the following expression @xcite : @xmath88\\right)-      \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\frac{\\overline{\\sigma}}{z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective collision volume @xmath89 varies between the cr - mt volume @xmath90 for @xmath91 and the volume of the rb - mot @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",

    ", we extract an upper and lower limit for the loss coefficient taking the maximum and minimum value of the factor @xmath98 and assuming this factor to be constant over the first 30s : @xmath107m@xmath103/s @xmath108m@xmath103/s . for this approximation we used the data points between 20s and 30s , where the data are well separated .",
    "the systematic relative error of these limits is again about 80% .",
    "the loss coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath86 we obtain , thus , differ by one order of magnitude .",
    "we attribute this to the large difference of the trap depths of the dissipative rb - mot and the conservative cr - mt .",
    "losses arise if the energy gained by inelastic collisions between unpolarized rb and polarized cr atoms is sufficiently high to eject an atom from its trap . due to energy and momentum conservation 63% of the released energy",
    "is transferred to the cr atoms .",
    "while in the rb - mot only fine structure changing ( fc ) and radiative escape ( re ) interspecies collisions lead to additional trap loss , in the shallow cr - mt fc , re and hyperfine changing collision in the rb atom , interspecies dipolar relaxation and depolarizing collisions which end in un - trapped states reduce the cr atom number .    the atom loss in the cr - mt in the presence of the rb - mot is accompanied by a temperature increase ( @xmath109k ) of the cr cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : tempincr ] depicts the evolution of the temperature with and without the presence of the other species . without rb atoms present ,",
    "this heating rate is reduced to @xmath110k / s and is mainly caused by anti - evaporation due to majorana losses in the cr - trap .",
    "we exclude thermalization with the rb - mot as the cause of the additional heating , because the same heating rate of the cr cloud was measured in cr traps prepared at temperatures lower and higher than the temperature of the rb - mot .",
    "since the cloud is not collisionally dense , the atoms are expelled from the trap without depositing any energy in the cloud after most inelastic processes .",
    "therefore , we attribute this increase to anti - evaporation caused by the mentioned loss mechanism within an inhomogeneous gas of rb atoms and to collisions which lead to depolarization of the magnetic sublevels . in latter collisions , the energy difference between the substates of cr and rb ( rb@xmath8 ) which is @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) in the small magnetic field near the trap center , is released and heats up the cloud .",
    "the first results on a combined cr - rb trap which are presented in this paper show that the operation of both mots is limited by the photoionization of the excited state of the rb - atoms which occurs with a cross section of @xmath113 . due to other dominant loss mechanisms interspecies collisions could not be directly observed in the combined mots . by overlapping the rb - mot and the cr - mt in space and time ,",
    "we measured light induced interspecies collisions with a cross section of @xmath114m@xmath3 , in the rb - mot . since collisions involving the excited state of cr are prevented in a combined mot of rb and cr atoms , a very similar cross section is expected for light induced collisions in a combined mot . due to the contribution of additional loss channels , the loss rate of cr - atoms in the very shallow mt is more pronounced .",
    "simultaneous operation of both mots could be improved by alternating cooling laser pulses for the two species which would suppress photoionization .",
    "if a rb ground state trap is prepared before the cr - mot is loaded , light - induced interspecies collisions could be prevented .",
    "the discussed measurements have already indicated the richness of the interaction in a combined system of trapped cr and rb atoms .",
    "an improvement of our rb - source should allow us to load a significant number of rb - atoms into a rb - mt and study ground state collisions .",
    "these measurements will allow us to extract the elastic and inelastic interspecies ground state cross sections which are important for sympathetic cooling . here",
    ", studies of inelastic processes resulting from the interaction of two species with very different internal structures are of theoretical interest to gain a deeper understanding of these relaxation processes .",
