    "since its introduction , quantum mechanics has kindled the imagination of scholars due to the interplay of its non - local character and particle - wave duality . using recent advances in technological control over coherent systems ,",
    "demonstration of these treats are still at the forefront of contemporary research  @xcite . in other words , a measurement of a quantum particle ( the latter may be described as a wave packet ) unveils its discrete nature , when it collapses to reside at a single point .",
    "the same particle , before `` collapsing '' , had assumed a non - local character .",
    "the compatibility of particle collapsing at a point and non - locality has been discussed and demonstrated in the context of the so - called elitzur - vaidman ( ev ) bomb [ aka `` interaction free measurement '' ( ifm ) ] : the wave - like interference of a single quantum particle is modified by the onset of a measurement ( bomb ) performed at one of an interferometer s arms , which could ( but may not ) destroy the particle  @xcite .",
    "the interferometer at hand is tuned such that when the `` bomb '' is absent , wave - like destructive interference renders one of its output ports dark .",
    "one then introduces the bomb ( hidden in a black box ) in one of the interferometer s arms .",
    "the bomb being `` lousy '' implies that even when a particle goes through that arm , there is a finite probability ( possibly close to 1 ) that it will not explode .",
    "if the bomb eventually explodes , one knows _",
    "a posteriori _ that the bomb was there .",
    "but there is a probability that the bomb does not go off , yet one detects a particle at the interferometer s dark port .",
    "that would definitely indicate that the black box has modified the interference pattern , hence a bomb has been introduced inside the black box .",
    "the detection of the presence of the bomb occurs when no interaction with it took place .",
    "notably , there is another possible inconclusive outcome : the bomb does not go off , and the interfering particle exits at the bright port . in that case",
    "one does not know whether the bomb was there or not . no matter how lousy the bomb is , within the many - body context of quantum physics , as the signal in the interferometer is collected over an ensemble of injected particles , there is a vanishing probability that the bomb would remain unexploded at asymptotically long times . rather than a bomb ,",
    "the realization of this ev experimental setup requires the construction of an interferometer with an absorber positioned on one of the interfering paths , as well as , the introduction of a single - particle source  @xcite . as such",
    ", this topic has remained mostly in the realm of quantum optics where ifm experiments have been proposed and demonstrated in various systems  @xcite with a variety of applications including imaging  @xcite , quantum computing  @xcite , and single - photon generation  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , several theoretical studies of the realization and utilization of ifm in electronic solid - state devices were recently pursued by considering , for example , superconducting quantum - bits ( qubits )  @xcite .",
    "additionally , an earlier study of electronic mach zehnder interferometers ( e - mzi )  @xcite , has focused on the employment of a wave - like picture , and the influence on the interference signal of a local perturbation in the interferometer . as such , the particle facet of the ev picture was missing .",
    "indeed , e - mzi are realized using chiral edge modes of quantum hall bars  @xcite , which are 1d channels well described as collective many - body plasmonic waves  @xcite .",
    "typically , these devices are operated at constant voltage bias leading to the injection of numerous electrons that would eventually , with certainty , trigger the ev - bomb .",
    "we note , additionally , that single - particle excitations on top of the electron sea in quantum hall edges have recently been obtained  @xcite .",
    "all this implies that the topic of non - locality along with wave - particle duality in complex many - electron systems is amenable to experimental studies .",
    " biased and @xmath0  grounded ) to the drains ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "inter - edge tunneling takes place at intersection points .",
    "( a ) a standard mzi with arms 1 and 2 of lengths @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "( b ) the dangling end at @xmath5 ( leading to @xmath6 ) serves as an absorber replacing the `` lousy '' bomb . ]    here we analyze the correlations of transport through an e - mzi with a leaking edge .",
    "this is an electronic manifestation of a variant of the ev - bomb where the leaky - edge corresponds to an absorber instead of a bomb  @xcite . in the particle - like limit of this device ,",
    "the probability of a particle being absorbed and transmitted to the drains at the same time is zero .",
    "such correlations in the case of many - particles will yield a non - vanishing result .",
    "this signifies the fact that the bomb may `` explode '' even if a signal is detected at the interferometer s dark port . employing a wave - like scattering matrix formulation , we compute the experimentally measurable many - body correlator and compare to two limiting cases ( single particle impinging vs. a large influx of particles ) .",
    "subsequently , we find the conditions for manifesting the wave - particle duality , and specifically obtaining the ev physics , in the context of many - body electronic system .",
    "we consider a standard e - mzi geometry where particles are injected from the source @xmath7 and eventually detected at the drains , @xmath1 and @xmath2 [ see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ] .",
    "note that all channels are chiral , i.e. particles may move only in the direction of the arrow .",
    "the evolution of an injected wave packet through the setup is described by considering incoming scattering states from the various sources that are labeled by their quantum number @xmath8 .",
    "schematically , the state of a particle injected from @xmath7 , after passing through beam - splitter @xmath9 at position @xmath10 , is described by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes  @xcite corresponding to beam - splitter @xmath9 , and @xmath14 are the scattering states corresponding to the upper and lower e - mzi arms .",
    "similarly , the beam splitter @xmath15 is characterized by reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . between the beam splitters @xmath9 and @xmath15 ,",
    "orbital phases are accumulated along arm 1 and arm 2 , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "additionally , for charged particles in the presence of a magnetic field , the relative phase of the two respective trajectories includes an aharonov - bohm phase @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a quantum of flux . with a proper gauge choice",
    ", we reabsorb these phases in an extra phase shift of the transmission coefficient of @xmath22 , with the interference phase @xmath23 .    we incorporate a semi - transparent absrober on the arm-1 of the e - mzi using an additional beam - splitter @xmath5 at position @xmath24 [ see fig.[setup](b ) ] .",
    "the propagation of an impinging particle is thus modified : the particle may exit the mzi through arm @xmath25 and reach drain @xmath6 .",
    "the effect of this extra beam splitter evolves the scattering state component in arm-1 , @xmath26 .",
    "this process is commonly referred to as _ partial - collapse _ and has been studied in the context of qubit - uncollapse  @xcite and null weak values  @xcite .",
    "this schematic evolution through the e - mzi can be conveniently recast in a scattering matrix formulation , i.e. , we can write the state of a particle in the interferometer in second quantization , with an annihilation operator @xmath27 here @xmath28 labels the different device arms and we assume arbitrarily that @xmath29 .",
    "the operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the annihilation operators of momentum eigenstates in the different sectors of the interferometer .",
    "they can be arranged in vectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , labeled by the arm - index @xmath38 , and are related by scattering matrices describing the effects of beam splitters via @xmath39 with @xmath40",
    "as a first step we analyze the the effect of the extra beam splitter @xmath5 using a schematic single - particle formulation .",
    "we assume that the incoming state is labeled by the quantum number @xmath8 , which , for clarity we omit in the notation below . in the absence of the leakage port ,",
    "the probability to measure the particle in drain @xmath1 is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 includes the effect of beam splitter @xmath9 , and we have defined @xmath43 to include the effect of beam splitter @xmath15 and the subsequent detection in @xmath1 . we have used the subscript @xmath44 to denote the probability in the absence of a leakage port .",
    "we obtain for the setup of fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "we think of the state of the propagating electron as a superposition of quibit states , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    introducing the beam - splitter @xmath5 on arm 1 ,",
    "allows the state @xmath47 to `` leak out '' ( partial - collapse ) to through branch 3 with probability @xmath49 [ cf .",
    "[ setup](b ) ] .",
    "the probability to reach drain @xmath6 is therefore , @xmath50 upon detection of the injected electron in @xmath6 , we declare the interference experiment void .",
    "in such a `` partial collapse '' the state @xmath47 is projected out of the space spanned by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if such a projection - out does not take place ( i.e. the electron is _ not _ detected in @xmath6 ) , the original qubit state is rotated by the measurement s back - action into @xmath51 with normalization @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , the probability for the particle to subsequently arrive in drain @xmath1 is @xmath53 , where by overline we denote the complementary event , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 can be written using the conditional probability @xmath56 . as a result",
    "we obtain that the particle would reach drain @xmath1 with the joint probability @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "note that due to causality @xmath59 and similarly @xmath60 the fact that @xmath61 can be used to detect the presence of the leakage port .",
    "specifically , if the mzi is tuned to have @xmath62 , the detection of a particle at @xmath1 in any single realization of the experiment indicates the presence of the leakage port without the particle having leaked out . if the particle is not detected at @xmath1 , no conclusion on the presence of a leakage channel can be drawn .",
    "this is a manifestation of the ev - bomb detection scheme .",
    "it is instructive to recover the results of this single particle analysis in the scattering matrix formalism , which provides the basis to analyze the statistical many - body effects in the following section . in the scattering matrix formalism",
    "we consider the injection of a _ single particle _",
    "( in the scattering state @xmath8 ) into the system , i.e. @xmath63 . the detection of the particle in @xmath64 is described by the projection operator @xmath65 . from eq .",
    "( [ scatterer ] ) , the probabilities for the injected particle to reach @xmath1 or @xmath6 are @xmath66 where we have introduced the quantities @xmath67 , @xmath68 . indeed , an explicit evaluation of @xmath69 and @xmath70 yields , for eqs .   and exactly the same expressions as eqs .   and , respectively",
    "additionally , the joint probability of detecting a particle at @xmath1 and @xmath6 is given by @xmath71 where , when the incoming state is of a single particle , we recover the result in eq .  .",
    "the results of this section describe experiments where a single particle is injected into the interferometer .",
    "while this is possible in quantum optics , it does not represent the typical experimental conditions of electronic devices .",
    "single - particle sources have been only recently reported in some specifically designed experimental architectures  @xcite .",
    "since many - electron physics is an essential part of quantum reality , we next analyze this limit .",
    "in a typical experiment with e - mzi , particles are injected into the source from a voltage biased reservoir , and are collected in the drain over a macroscopically long time .",
    "this being the case , only statistical quantities averaged over a many - particle ensemble are accessible , and the signals at the detector correspond to statistical averages of the source - drain transition probabilities computed in the previous section .",
    "specifically , for an e - mzi with a voltage bias @xmath72 at @xmath7 , the measured current at @xmath1 is given by the rate of electrons reaching this drain out of the total rate , @xmath73 , of electrons impinging from the source .",
    "the currents through the device are therefore statistical probabilities for an impinging electron to reach the various drains , and are precisely given in terms of the probabilities calculated in the single - particle picture above : the current at drain @xmath74 will be given by @xmath75 .",
    "when the signal in @xmath1 is collected over a large number of particles , any outcome of the ifm - experiment would have a macroscopic leakage of particles in @xmath6 even if the e - mzi is tuned to have a vanishing current in the absence of the port @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in the original formulation of the problem with the bomb , the bomb would necessarily explode . in short , under the above conditions the detection of the current at @xmath6 does not constitute an uncontested manifestation of ifm .",
    "can , and under what conditions , an electronic mzi setup reproduce the original ev bomb measurement scheme ? in order to clarify this",
    "we focus on the difference between the single - particle results and the many - particle statistical averages relevant for experiments , which appears when dealing with joint probabilities .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated considering , e.g. , the statistical joint probability of detecting particles at drain @xmath1 and @xmath6 . in order to relate such a joint probability with a quantity directly accessible in experiments ,",
    "we next study the current - current correlations in a _ many - body _",
    "( albeit non - interacting ) system .",
    "we assume that a voltage bias @xmath76 is applied to the source @xmath7 , which is held at temperature @xmath77 . for a system with linear dispersion relation , the current operator is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the annihilation operator in the @xmath80-th arm , and the normal order operator , @xmath81 , indicates the subtraction of the mean equilibrium contribution .",
    "we consider the cross - current correlation defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an infrared cut - off , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",

    "nonetheless , in the limit of short pulses , @xmath134 , the correlator yields an outcome that agrees with the single - particle picture .",

    "we considered the typical experimental settings when an ensemble of particles is injected in the interferometer , i.e. , the current in the interferometer yields a statistically averaged signal .",
    "we analyzed the cross - current correlation at the dark and leakage ports , which is vanishing in the single - particle original proposal of the experiment , but remains generally finite in the many - particle statistical implementation .",
    "this has allowed us to identify the parameters regime ( voltage bias , temperature ) for which the many - body correlations approach the single - particle result .",
    "we find the regime where the wave - particle duality emerges is lies just at the frontiers of actual experiments with electronic mzis , where the main limitations are due to the size of the interferometer and the mobility of the electrons at the edges of a hall bar .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that the detection of ifm in a many - body electronic system seems to involve two competing facets that need to be dealt with : ifm a - la elitsur - vaidman requires to deal with particles ( that , in principle , can be pin - pointed to a specific spatial coordinate ) ; at the same time , the setup employed is an interferometer , which invokes the wave character of the quantum object .",
