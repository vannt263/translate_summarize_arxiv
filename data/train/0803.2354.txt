    "we may calculate ensemble averages for example @xmath15 . on the other hand from the trajectory of a single particle @xmath16",
    "we may construct the time average @xmath17 . for ergodic motion",
    "the time and ensemble averages are identical in the limit of long measurement times @xmath18 .",
    "what is the physical meaning of a long measurement time ?",
    "brownian dynamics in a finite interval , is characterized by a finite relaxation time which is the time scale on which particles reach thermal equilibrium . for the simplest case of brownian motion between two reflecting walls , with a system of size @xmath19",
    ", dimensional analysis gives a relaxation time of the order @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the diffusion constant .",
    "a second time scale , the average time between jump events @xmath22 is more microscopical . the latter is related to @xmath21 with the einstein relation @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the variance of jump lengths .",
    "ergodicity is almost trivial when the measurement time is much longer than these two time scales .",
    "for example for a brownian motion in a harmonic field .    on the other hand anomalous diffusion and transport ,",
    "is characterized in many cases by a diverging relaxation time and a diverging microscopical time scale @xmath22 .",
    "for example unbiased sub - diffusion is characterized by a mean square displacement @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the reader immediately realizes that the diffusion constant is zero , in the sense that @xmath27 , hence the mentioned relaxation time @xmath28 is infinite even when the system size @xmath19 is finite . indeed according to the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model @xcite ,",
    "anomalous sub - diffusion is found when waiting times between jumps diverge @xmath29 , which is related to the scher - montroll power law waiting time probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "for such scale free anomalous diffusion the relaxation time and the averaged sojourn time @xmath22 are infinite , and ergodicity is broken weakly .",
    "strong ergodicity breaking is found when a system is divided into inaccessible regions of its phase space .",
    "namely a particle or a system starting in one region can not explore all other regions due to some non - passable barrier ( e.g. in the micro - canonical case , by regions we mean sections on the constant energy surface ) .",
    "bouchaud @xcite introduced the profound concept of weak ergodicity breaking in the context of glass dynamics , which in turn is related to infinite ergodic theory @xcite investigated by mathematicians using a dynamical approach . in weak ergodicity breaking the phase space is not broken into inaccessible regions . instead due to the power law sticking times the dynamics is non - stationary and non - ergodic . since the ergodic hypothesis is the pillar on which statistical mechanics is built , but at the same time",
    "also long tailed power law distributions of trapping times are very common in the description of physical behaviors @xcite , it is natural to investigate the non - ergodic properties of systems whose stochastic dynamics are governed by such anomalous statistics .",
    "previously weak ergodicity breaking was investigated for : blinking quantum dots @xcite , lvy walks @xcite occupation time statistics of the ctrw model @xcite , fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite , deterministic one dimensional maps @xcite , numerical simulations of fractional transport in a washboard potential @xcite and in vivo gene regulation by dna - binding proteins @xcite .",
    "recently a relation between statistics of weak ergodicity breaking and statistics of non - self averaging in models of quenched disorder was found @xcite .",
    "hence it is timely to present a general statistical mechanical framework for weak - ergodicity breaking .    in this manuscript",
    "we investigate the distribution of time averaged observables for weak ergodicity breaking .",
    "we explore the relations between ensemble averages and fluctuations of time averages . and investigate the transition from the localization limit @xmath31 to the usual ergodic behavior found for @xmath8 .",
    "specific examples for the distribution of @xmath32 for a particle undergoing a sub - diffusive ctrw in a potential @xmath10 are worked out is detail . in the second part of the paper we derive our main results using a generalized ctrw approach .",
    "we investigate models with a single waiting time pdf and more general models with several types of such pdfs .",
    "a brief summary of some of our results was recently published in @xcite .    the theory of weak - ergodicity breaking is mathematically related to the arcsine distribution @xcite , and to its extensions @xcite .",
    "consider a normal brownian motion with free boundary conditions in one dimension @xmath33 where @xmath34 is gaussian white noise .",
    "the time @xmath35 spent by the particle in @xmath36 is called an occupation time .",
    "naive expectation is that the single particle will occupy @xmath36 for half of the measurement time @xmath37 , when the latter is long .",
    "instead the pdf of the occupation fraction is @xmath38 this arcsine law is related to the well known pdf of first - passage times from @xmath39 to the origin , for simple brownian motion .",
    "the latter pdf decays @xmath40 for long first - passage times @xcite , and the averaged return time is infinite . roughly speaking , during the dynamics of the particle",
    ", it will usually occupy either the domain @xmath36 or the domain @xmath41 for a duration which is of the order of the measurement time . thus the arcsine pdf eq .",
    "( [ eqarc ] ) has a @xmath42 shape .",
    "this behavior is found because the brownian motion was assumed to be unbounded .",
    "if we add reflecting walls on @xmath43 and @xmath44 the dynamics will be ergodic and in the long time limit the particle spends half of the time in @xmath45 and the other half in @xmath46 .",
