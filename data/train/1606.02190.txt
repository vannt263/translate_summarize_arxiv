    "<S> while the pontryagin maximum principle can be used to calculate candidate extremals for optimal orbital transfer problems , these candidates can not be guaranteed to be at least locally optimal unless sufficient optimality conditions are satisfied . in this paper , through constructing a parameterized family of extremals around a reference extremal , some second - order necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong - local optimality of the free - time multi - burn fuel - optimal transfer are established under certain regularity assumptions . moreover , the numerical procedure for computing these optimality conditions is presented . </S>",
    "<S> finally , two medium - thrust fuel - optimal trajectories with different number of burn arcs for a typical orbital transfer problem are computed and the local optimality of the two computed trajectories are tested thanks to the second - order optimality conditions established in this paper . </S>"
