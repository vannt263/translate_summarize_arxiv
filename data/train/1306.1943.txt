    "while improving and searching for more suitable gravitational theory , attempts for a geometrical unification of gravity with other interactions has begun by employing extra dimensions beyond the conventional four  dimensional ( ) space  time . at first",
    ", nordstrm  @xcite built a unified theory based on extra dimensions , then kaluza  @xcite and klein  @xcite established a @xmath7 version of general relativity ( * gr * ) in which electrodynamics rises from an extra fifth dimension .",
    "till now , an intensive amount of researches have been performed on a similar idea either via different mechanism of compactification of extra dimension or generalizing it to non  compact scenarios  @xcite such as the brane ",
    "world theories  @xcite , the space  time  matter or induced",
    " matter ( * i m * ) theories  @xcite , and higher dimensional cosmology , e.g. ref .",
    "the latter theories are grounded on the campbell  magaard theorem that asserts every analytical @xmath8dimensional riemannian space can locally be embedded in an @xmath9dimensional vacuum one  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the importance of this theorem is that the matter sources of @xmath10 space  times can be viewed as a manifestation of extra dimensions . in another word ,",
    "@xmath10 field equations with matter sources can be achieved by inducing @xmath7 field equations without matter sources .",
    "this idea has been the core of the i m theory using gr as the underlying theory .",
    "on the other hand , jordan  @xcite conceived a new kind of gravitational theory , known as the scalar  tensor theory , by embedding a curved @xmath10 space  time in a flat @xmath7 one .",
    "following his idea , brans and dicke  @xcite introduced a version of the scalar  tensor gravitational theory , as an alternative to gr , with a non  minimally scalar field coupled to the curvature , in which the weak equivalence principle is preserved and makes it to be more machian than gr . unfortunately , its weakness is mismatching with the solar system observations  @xcite , which is a generic difficulty of the scalar ",
    "tensor theories in the solar system constraint  @xcite .",
    "however , it does  not necessarily denote that the evolution of the universe , at all scales , should be close to gr , in which there are some debates on its tests on the cosmic scales as well  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background suggest that the ordinary @xmath10 universe is very close to a spatially flat universe  @xcite@xcite , and the observations of type ia  supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe presently is accelerating  @xcite@xcite .",
    "hence , in one school of thought , the main component of the universe should be consist of what usually has been called dark energy  @xcite .",
    "since then , a considerable amount of work has been performed in the literature to explain the acceleration of the universe .",
    "most of the dark energy models , such as the quintessence  @xcite@xcite , the chaplygin gas  @xcite and the k - essence  @xcite models , involve minimally coupled scalar fields with different potentials .",
    "these scalar fields or the potentials have been added in _ priori _ by hand , and hence , their origins are  not understood . nevertheless , in the recent decades , explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe via fundamental theories has been a great challenge .",
    "recently , a @xmath7 vacuum brans  dicke ( * bd * ) theory based on the idea of i m theory has been investigated  @xcite , in which the role of gr has been replaced by the bd theory of gravitation as the fundamental underlying theory . it has been illustrated that @xmath7 vacuum bd equations , when reduced to four dimensions , give a modified version of the @xmath10 bd theory with an induced potential .",
    "whereas in the literature , to obtain accelerating universes , such potentials has been added in _ priori _ by hand .",
    "a few applications of this approach have also been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "although one of the aims of higher dimensional theories is to obtain @xmath10 matter from pure geometry , but it is sometimes desirable to have a higher dimensional energy  momentum tensor or a scalar field , for example in compactification of the extra curved dimensions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the reduction procedure of a @xmath7 analogue of the bd theory with matter content , on every hypersurface orthogonal to an extra cyclic dimension ( that recovers the modified bd theory described by a 4metric coupled to two scalar fields ) has previously been accomplished in the literature  @xcite .",
    "besides , the main idea of the brane models is the existence of a higher dimensional bulk in which the universe is sitting as a hypersurface and all the matter fields , except gravity , are confined to this brane  @xcite .",
    "cosmological implications in the context of brane worlds have also been studied , e.g. it has been shown that the recent accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by a geometrical originated dark energy caused by an addition of a brane curvature scalar term in the action  @xcite .    similar to the idea of brane scenarios , but based on the i m theory with underlying the bd theory of gravitation , in this work , we employ a generalized friedmann  lematre ",
    "robertson  walker ( * flrw * ) type solution for a @xmath7 bd theory and investigate its cosmological implications .",
    "for this purpose , in the next section , we give a brief review of a @xmath7 bd theory following the idea of i m theory .",
    "then , in a @xmath10 hypersurface , we gather the extra terms emerging from the scale factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar field as dark energy component of an energy  momentum tensor in addition to the usual energy  momentum tensor of all ( the baryonic and dark ) matter . in section",
    "@xmath11 , we consider a generalized flrw metric in a @xmath7 space  time , and derive the flrw cosmological equations .",
    "then , we manage and obtain the total energy conservation equation as separated into two energy conservation equations for all matter and dark energy , with non  interacting and two simple interacting cases .",
    "however , as the cosmological equations are strictly non  linear and do  not have exact solution , in order to proceed , we assume some simplifications . in section  @xmath12 , we apply the observational constraints for the interacting cases of the model , and use the markov chain monte carlo ( * mcmc * ) method to fit the free parameters of the model with the scp union2.1 sn ia compilation  @xcite based on the bayesian statistics  @xcite .",
    "a few tables and figures are also provided for a better view of the acceptable range and the best fitted values of parameters . finally ,",
    "conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "following the idea of i m theories , one can consider the bd theory of gravitation as the underlying theory instead of gr . in this respect ,",
    "the action of @xmath7 bd theory in the jordan frame can analogously be written as @xmath13=\\int\\sqrt{|{}^{_{(5)}}g| } \\left ( \\phi \\ ^{^{(5)}}\\!r-\\frac{\\omega}{\\phi}g^{_{ab}}\\phi_{,_{a}}\\phi_{,_{b}}+ 16\\pi l_{m } \\right ) d^{5}x\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 , the capital latin indices run from zero to four , @xmath15 is @xmath7 ricci scalar , @xmath16 is the determinant of @xmath7 metric @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a positive scalar field that describes the gravitational coupling in five dimensions , @xmath19 represents the matter lagrangian and @xmath20 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "hence , the field equations obtained from action ( [ 5d action ] ) are @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is @xmath7 einstein tensor , @xmath24 is @xmath7 energy ",
    "momentum tensor , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in order to have a non  ghost scalar field in the conformally related einstein frame , i.e. a field with a positive kinetic energy term in that frame , the bd coupling constant must be @xmath27  @xcite@xcite .",
    "though recently , some new ghost dark energy models have been suggested to explain the observed acceleration of the universe  @xcite .    as a plausible assumption",
    ", we consider that @xmath24 exactly represents the same baryonic and dark matter sources of a @xmath10 hypersurface , i.e. @xmath28 . hence , in this case @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy density and the pressure of the matter , and the greek indices run from zero to three . also , cosmological purposes usually restrict attentions to @xmath7 metrics of the simple form @xmath32 in local coordinates @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents the fifth coordinate and @xmath35 . by assuming the @xmath7 space  time",
    "is foliated by a family of hypersurfaces , say @xmath36 , that are defined by fixed values of @xmath34 , then , one can obtain the metric intrinsic to every generic hypersurface , e.g. @xmath37 , by restricting the line element ( [ 5d metric ] ) to displacements confined to it .",
    "thus , the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath38 becomes @xmath39 in such a way that the usual @xmath10 space  time metric , @xmath40 , can be recovered .",
    "therefore , after some manipulations , equation ( [ 5d einstein eq ] ) on the hypersurface @xmath38 can be written as @xmath41 where we consider @xmath42 as dark energy component of the energy ",

    "for a @xmath7 universe with an extra space  like dimension in addition to the three usual spatially homogenous and isotropic ones , metric ( [ 5d metric ] ) , as a generalized flrw solution , can be written as @xmath46+b^2(t)dy^2\\,.\\ ] ] generally , the scalar field @xmath18 and the scale factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 should be functions of @xmath49 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , for physical plausibility and simplicity , we assume that the hypersurface  orthogonal space  like is a killing vector field in the underlying @xmath7 space  time  @xcite , i.e. the extra dimension to be a cyclic coordinate . besides",
    ", the functionality of the scale factor @xmath48 on @xmath34 could be eliminated either by transforming to a new extra coordinate ( if @xmath48 be a separable function ) or making no changes in the consequent equations if @xmath48 is the only field that depends on @xmath34 . in another word",
    ", in the compactified extra dimension scenarios , all fields can be fourier  expanded around the fixed value @xmath50 , and hence , one can get the observable terms independent of @xmath34 , i.e. physics would be effectively independent of the compactified fifth dimension , see , e.g. ref .  @xcite . with this solution , we will show that the universe can accept both accelerating and decelerating expansion eras .    by considering metric ( [ frw metric ] ) , the bd equations ( [ 5d einstein eq ] )",
    "reduce as follows .",
    "the time component @xmath51 gives @xmath52 the spatial components @xmath53 provide @xmath54\\,\\ ] ] and the @xmath55 component yields @xmath56 also , the scalar field equation ( [ 5d scalar eq ] ) becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    in the last part of equations ( [ frw1 ] ) and ( [ frw2 ] ) , we have defined the energy density and pressure of dark energy as @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "hence , the state equation of dark energy obviously yields @xmath63    in order to find the functionality of @xmath64 with the time , equations ( [ frw1])([4d scalar eq ] ) must be exactly solved .",
    "however , as these equations are coupled non  linearly , one should apply numerical methods . as an alternative , in the following , by considering a few simplifications , we proceed to fit the parameters of the model by observational data analysis , and discuss the properties of the model .",
    "first of all , let us obtain the energy conservation equations . in this respect",
    ", one can take the time derivative of equation ( [ frw1 ] ) and substitutes equation ( [ frw2 ] ) into it , and finally gets @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . as the nature of dark energy is unknown , the detailed coupling form among it and matter is unclear .",
    "hence , one can expect that their conservation equations should not be independent . in this case , let us apply a plausible simplification by separating equation ( [ conservation mix ] ) into two distinguished continuity equations for @xmath68 and @xmath30 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 where the @xmath71 term stands for interacting terms among matter and dark energy .",
    "such a similar interacting term has also been used in the literature , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    to proceed further , we take @xmath72 as dust ( the baryonic and dark ) matter , and assume @xmath64 to be a constant .",
    "hence , relation ( [ w x ] ) imposes the power ",
    "law solutions @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75    if one assumes the power  law solutions ( [ a])([c ] ) , equations ( [ frw1])([frw3 ] ) will restrict either the geometry to be spatially flat or @xmath76 to be one , i.e. a free expanding universe . as the latter choice is  not interested , we consider @xmath77 in this work .",
    "this choice is also consistent with the measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation that indicate the universe must be very close to spatially flat one  @xcite@xcite .",
    "note that , there are four independent equations ( [ frw1])([4d scalar eq ] ) that , in general , determine @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath18 ( or equivalently @xmath76 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 in the power  law solutions ) and @xmath30 .",
    "these unknowns also depend on the bd parameter @xmath20 . in order that our _ anstze _ do  not lead to over  constraining equations",
    ", we manage the values of the parameters of the model including @xmath20 to be , by using the data analysis method , consistent with the observations .    in the next two subsections , we find the relations of @xmath68 and @xmath30 with the scale factors and the scalar field for both the non  interacting and interacting cases . for interacting cases , we consider two simple and reasonable choices of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 the symbol @xmath83 is denoted as a general notation that represents either the scale factor of the ordinary spatial dimensions , @xmath47 , or the scale factor of the fifth dimension , @xmath48 , or the scalar field , @xmath18 .",
    "that is , @xmath84 can be either @xmath85 or @xmath86 or @xmath87 , however , by matching the model with the observations , we will figure out the best choice of @xmath83 .",
    "now , for the matter to be a dust one and the dark energy parameter of state to be time independent , if there is no interacting term , then equations ( [ conservation m ] ) and ( [ conservation x ] ) lead to @xmath89 and @xmath90 which for the power  law solutions ( [ a])([c ] ) become @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the energy density of matter , the energy density of dark energy , the scale factor and the scalar field at the present time , respectively .    substituting the power  law solutions in equation ( [ frw1 ] ) ( and also equation ( [ 4d scalar eq ] ) ) imposes @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which does  not give an accelerated universe . hence , in the following , we investigate different interacting cases to figure out any possible accelerating solutions .",
    "however , when @xmath64 is  not constant ( as a more general case ) , then the non  interacting choice may also provide some interesting results .      with the same assumptions as in the non  interacting cases , to find out analytically the ranges of the parameters of our model for interacting cases @xmath99 and @xmath101",

    "@xmath111 surprisingly show that both the decelerating and the accelerating solutions are acceptable in the range @xmath132 .",
    "however , a fixed value for the parameter @xmath76 for all epochs implies that the universe is always either decelerating or accelerating  @xcite , which is the common property of the power  law solutions . in this respect",

    "it is a general belief that the universe is in an accelerated expanding phase .",
    "thus , the main content of it should be consisted of what usually has been called dark energy .",
    "hence , a considerable amount of work has been performed to explain the acceleration of the universe , but until now , the origin and the nature of dark energy is unknown .",
    "most of the dark energy models , such as the quintessence , the chaplygin gas and the k - essence models , involve minimally coupled scalar fields with different potentials which have been added by hand , and nothing has been asserted about their origins . also in the recent decade , explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe by alternative theories of gravitation has been a great challenge .    in this work , following the approach of the induced  matter theory , we have investigated the cosmological implications of a @xmath7 bd theory , in order to explain the acceleration of the universe . after inducing in a @xmath10 hypersurface , we have classified the energy ",

    "one part represents all kind of the matter ( the baryonic and dark ) , and the other one contains every extra terms emerging from the scale factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar field , which we have considered as the energy  momentum tensor of dark energy .",
    "as the cosmological equations of the model are extremely non  linearly coupled , we have assumed some simplifications in order to proceed the properties of the model .",
    "the total energy conservation has been separated into two equations , one for the matter conservation and the other for dark energy one .",
    "of course , such a procedure has been performed without interacting term and with two particular interacting terms between the two parts .",
    "we consider the parameter of the state equation of dark energy to be constant .",
    "hence , the equations of the model admit the power  law solutions which impose a spatially flat geometry .    the non  interacting case gives decelerated universes , though , the interacting cases give both decelerated and accelerated universes . for the latter case ,",
    "we have figured out analytically the acceptable ranges of parameters of the model , and have illustrated the results in a few tables and figures .    then after , for these interacting cases , we have employed the mcmc method based on the bayesian statistics to investigate the consistency of the model parameters with the observational data from supernovae type ia .",

    ", almost the whole parameter space will be covered .",
    "in other words , there are no preferred values for the parameters of the model in this interacting case .",

    "the hubble time corresponding to the best fitted value of @xmath134 is @xmath135 .",
    "the best fitted values of the parameters of the model are also listed in a table , and the results suggest that the energy density of the matter multiplied by the ratio of the time derivative of the scalar field to itself plays the role of the best interacting term between the matter and dark energy . also , the consistent values of the parameters indicate that the model has a ghost scalar field with @xmath136 , while the scale factor of the fifth dimension shrinks with the time .",
    "although the model has a ghost scalar field with this value for the bd coupling constant , the consistent values of the parameters reveals a non  ghost dark energy with the state parameter @xmath137 as well",
    ". that is , with this value of the dark energy state parameter , there should  not be big rip singularities and ghost instabilities .",
