    "it is widely accepted that in the dark age the first collapsing density perturbation collapses and cools owing to hydrogen molecules ( @xmath4 ) to form so - called population iii ( popiii ) stars ( bromm et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "abel et al . 2000 , 2002 ;",

    "popiii is expected to form in halos typically with @xmath5 ( tegmark et al .",

    "the former may spread metals made by nuclear fusion and sweeps neighboring gas by shock ( e.g. , heger et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the latter .",
    "there are two types of the radiative feedbacks , which are ionization and dissociation ( whalen et al .",
    "2004 ; susa et al . 2009 ; hasegawa et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "ionization of hydrogen atoms ( @xmath6 ) provides strong heating which causes evaporation of clouds",
    ". however , since inter stellar matter mainly consists of @xmath6 with large opacity , ionization photon tends to be prevented from spreading , and photoionization would occur mainly within halos . on the other hand , photodissociation of @xmath4 would occur even out of halos ( kitayama et al . 2004 ) .",
    "thus , it is expected that there are some regions which are not photoionized but photodissociated .",
    "we investigate gravitational collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds in such a region .    since @xmath4 is main coolant in the early universe , if @xmath4 is photodissociated , a collapsing primordial cloud ( @xmath7 ) heats adiabatically up to high temperature ( @xmath8 ) where atomic cooling becomes effective .",
    "in such a case , it is suggested that high mass objects ( @xmath2 ) may form because jeans mass ( @xmath9 ) is large ( e.g. , bromm @xmath10 loeb 2003 ) .",
    "this possibility may connect the direct formation of supermassive black hole .",
    "however , if collapsing cloud fragments into many small clumps , collapsed object may form star cluster ( omukai @xmath10 yoshii 2003 ) . in order to understand actual final outcome and their initial mass function clearly , further detailed investigation of thermal and dynamical evolution of collapsing clouds is required .",
    "omukai ( 2001 ) investigated the evolution of spherical clouds under the dissociation radiation .",
    "the author calculated the evolution of the central region of a collapsing sphere , assuming free - fall collapse . started from @xmath11 , the clouds collapse adiabatically in the early stage , @xmath12 . after this stage , thermal evolution of clouds",
    "is divided into two types of tracks .",
    "when the external radiation is very strong ( e.g , with the intensity larger than @xmath13 at @xmath14 for thermal radiation of @xmath15 ) , @xmath4 is photodissociated enough to suppress @xmath4 cooling . in this case ,",
    "main coolant is provided by hydrogen atom .",
    "on the other hand , if the intensity of the external radiation is moderate , sufficient amount of @xmath4 forms and clouds cool mainly via @xmath4 cooling . susa ( 2007 )",
    "investigated more realistic evolution of a spherical cloud under the uv radiation from a single light source by three - dimensional calculations .",
    "the author investigated whether or not clouds collapse for parameters such as distance from the light source and the density when the light source turns on .",
    "as for the formation of the spherical clouds investigated above , a filamentary cloud is a possible origin .",
    "filamentary clouds are commonly expected during the way to form the stars . when sheet - like cloud forms , the sheet - like cloud tends to fragment into the filamentary clouds ( miyama , narita , & hayashi 1987a , b ) . in cosmological simulation , the filamentary structure forms from density perturbation which has @xmath16 ( abel et al .",

    "these filamentary clouds have a possibility to produce spherical clouds by fragmentation ( nagasawa 1987 ; inutsuka @xmath10 miyama 1997 ) .",
    "thus , in order to understand the origin and property of a collapsing spherical cloud , it is useful to investigate the evolution of filamentary clouds .",
    "previous works about fragmentation of primordial filamentary clouds include one - zone models ( uehara et al .",

    "if the initial fraction of @xmath4 is lower than @xmath18 , @xmath4 becomes main coolant and the fragment mass is @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial fraction of @xmath4 is higher than @xmath20 , a filamentary cloud with low initial density ( @xmath21 ) cools mainly via @xmath17 cooling since @xmath4 promotes the formation of @xmath17 with larger cooling rate . in this case , the fragment mass is @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath25 is required .",
    "omukai & yoshii ( 2003 ) investigated fragmentation of the filamentary cloud under the uv radiation using a one - zone model .",
    "based on the results by nakamura & umemura ( 2001 ) , they assumed that the filamentary cloud fragments when its density becomes 100 times higher than that at the loitering point at which temperature is a local minimum in @xmath26 plane owing to @xmath4 cooling .",
    "the authors concluded that the fragment mass is smaller under the stronger uv radiation .",
    "however , the condition for fragmentation given by nakamura & umemura ( 2001 ) is considered for the cases without the external radiation .",
    "thus , it is not clear that this condition for fragmentation is applicable for the cases with the external radiation .",
    "when the filamentary cloud suffers photodissociation , it will collapse adiabatically and it will fragment before it reaches loitering point . in such a case , the fragment mass becomes larger than in the cases without the external radiation .    in this paper",

    "we investigate whether or not the external radiation photodissociates enough @xmath4 to prevent @xmath4 cooling and whether or not the external radiation makes fragment mass larger . instead of assuming free - fall collapse , we calculate the dynamical evolution by solving virial equation taking into account the effect of pressure gradient force as a result of insufficient cooling due to photodissociation . as for the condition for fragmentation , we assume that the filamentary clouds fragment when the timescale of fragmentation becomes shorter than the timescale of density evolution ( see @xmath24 ) .",

    "instead , it continues to collapse and shields itself from the dissociation photon . then @xmath152 begins to increase at @xmath184 .",
    "after that , @xmath4 cooling becomes efficient and the evolution becomes similar to that in figure 1 ( @xmath178 ) . as a result , the filamentary cloud collapses until it becomes optically thick to @xmath4 lines , and it fragments into the low mass clumps about @xmath185 .",

    "the difference between figure 5 and figure 4 ( @xmath190 ) is the value of line mass .",
    "since the initial density is low , in both cases @xmath4 is dissociated and the filamentary clouds evolve adiabatically in their initial stage . since the line mass for the case in figure 5 is smaller , the slight increase of temperature is sufficient to suppress collapse . on the other hand , since the line mass for the case in figure 4 is larger , the slight increase of temperature is not sufficient to suppress collapse .",
    "hence in the case in figure 4 the filamentary cloud does not fragment in the early stage of collapse and eventually @xmath4 forms enough to cool the filamentary cloud .",
    "difference of these two results originates from the line mass of the filamentary clouds .",
    "a critical line mass to shield themselves from the dissociation photon is discussed analytically in @xmath191 .",
    "figure 6 shows the result of the case with high initial density , small line mass , and strong external radiation , @xmath192 .",
    "the case in figure 6 corresponds to the case in figure 2 ( @xmath193 ) with the external radiation .",
    "the evolution of the filamentary cloud in figure 6 is similar to that in figure 2 ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "this is because the initial density is high enough to shield the filamentary cloud from dissociation photon .",
    "adiabatic heating dominates @xmath4 cooling from the early stage of collapse , and temperature increases gradually . in this case , the filamentary cloud fragments into the slightly more massive fragments than in the case without the external radiation ( figure 2 ( @xmath193 ) ) .",
    "this is because the external radiation dissociates a little @xmath4 in the early stage of collapse .",
    "however , the difference is negligible .      to investigate how parameters affect the evolution of temperature , we systematically calculate with changing one of three parameters in the parameter space ( @xmath115 , @xmath122 , @xmath137 ) . for unchanged parameters , @xmath133 , @xmath194 , and @xmath142",

    "figure 7 shows the evolution of temperature in the cases with various @xmath115 .",

    "most of @xmath4 is photodissociated in the early phase ( @xmath197 ) and temperature increases adiabatically .",
    "each line in figure 8 overlaps each other during the early stage of collapse .",
    "this is because the effect of photodissociation is similar for the same density .",

    ", the filamentary clouds collapse to high density since virial temperature is large .",
    "the filamentary clouds with @xmath199 form sufficient amount of @xmath4 to cool during collapse even with strong dissociation radiation ( @xmath142 ) . once the filamentary clouds cool , they continue to collapse and reach the high density ( @xmath200 ) before fragmentation .",
    "figure 9 shows the evolution of temperature in the cases with various @xmath137 . in the cases with the external radiation ( @xmath201 ) , temperature increases adiabatically since most of @xmath4 is photodissociated and @xmath4 cooling is suppressed .",
    "on the other hand , in the case without the external radiation ( @xmath202 ) , temperature does not increase adiabatically .",
    "figure 10 shows the fragment mass for all the parameters by using contours maps in @xmath203 plane .",
    "results for different values of @xmath202 , @xmath204 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 are presented in different diagrams .",

    "however , in the case with @xmath212 or @xmath199 , it is seen that the fragment mass is hardly changed by the external radiation .",
    "this is explained as follows : as for the cases with large @xmath115 , the filamentary clouds shield themselves from the dissociation radiation from the early stage of evolution . as for the cases with large @xmath122 , as shown in @xmath190 , the filamentary clouds continue to collapse up to density high enough to shield themselves from the external radiation and form @xmath4 even if @xmath4 is photodissociated in the early stage of collapse . the filamentary cloud in the uniform model whose collapse is homologous tends to collapse to higher density than the realistic model whose collapse is run - away collapse .",
    "thus , it is probably as the result of our choice of the uniform model that the filamentary cloud with a little larger @xmath122 than moderate value collapses to high density in spite of @xmath4 loss in the early stage of collapse . in @xmath31",
    ", we compare the result with the modified one - zone model including the effect of run - away collapse .",
    "further investigation including spatial variation will be presented in the separate paper .",
    "we assumed initial infall velocity at the cloud surface to be same as the sound velocity . here , we comment on the effect of faster initial infall velocity which may be possible under the effect of dark matter gravity .",
    "much faster initial velocity can help the filamentary clouds to shield themselves from the dissociation radiation due to the rapid evolution of density before fragmentation .",
    "we have checked this possibility with the model as in figure 5 ( @xmath213 ) where most of @xmath4 is photodissociated during the early stage of collapse .",
    "it is found that the filamentary cloud can collapse to form @xmath4 and shield themselves from the dissociation radiation if the initial velocity is five times or lager than five times sound speed .",
    "an example of numerical result is shown in figure 11 where photodissociation is suppressed at the early stage of collapse and the filamentary cloud does not fragment until density becomes large ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "thus , the filamentary clouds with highly supersonic initial infall velocity tend to avoid the effect of the external radiation .",
    "this is consistent qualitatively with hasegawa et al .",
    "( 2009b ) who investigated the formation of globular clusters as a result of fragmentation in such a way .",
    "although initial @xmath4 fraction is assumed to be @xmath161 at @xmath215 in  3 ( and @xmath31 ) , this value of @xmath4 fraction is expected to be affected by the external radiation before the density of the cloud reaches @xmath115 . in previous papers without the external radiation , @xmath216",
    "is adopted as initial states after virialization . in this sense , the above initial value of @xmath217 should be regarded as for the case where the external radiation turns on at the moment when the filamentary cloud with @xmath218 forms . on the other hand ,",
    "omukai @xmath10 yoshii ( 2003 ) considered the cases with sufficiently low initial density @xmath219 , in which the external radiation had turned on before the filamentary cloud forms .",
    "is our assumption that initial @xmath152 is set to be @xmath161 valid when the external radiation turns on before the filamentary cloud forms ? in this subsection",

    "@xmath4 fraction at @xmath220 is shown as a function of @xmath221 for the cases with different @xmath137 .",

    "in this section , we analytically investigate the property shown in the numerical results in @xmath29 .",
    "to explain the property of the collapsing filamentary cloud , three criteria are considered in the view point whether or not the filamentary cloud can cool during collapse .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath223 of initial density that determines whether or not @xmath4 cooling dominates adiabatic heating at the start of collapse . before we consider the effect of the external radiation , we derive @xmath223 without the external radiation . if initial density exceeds @xmath223 , temperature increases from the early stage of collapse and the filamentary clouds fragment into massive fragments ( @xmath177 ) as shown in figure 2 ( @xmath193 ) .",

    "in this paper , however , we assume isotropic and steady external radiation field for simplicity . if this source of the external radiation is regarded as the group of sources ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2008 ) , new stars must be formed continuously around the filamentary cloud . even in such a case , intensity and spectrum",
    "may be more complex and evolve with time .",
    "furthermore , the effect from ionization photon may not be neglected .",
    "these issues may be important but are out scope of this paper .",
    "although the rarefied filament model is developed in this paper , it is still questionable whether or not all of the filamentary cloud fragment before the moment when rarefaction wave reaches the center . to clarify this point ,",
    "more accurate calculation at least one - dimensional hydrodynamical calculation is required .",
    "we thank fumio takahara for fruitful discussion and continuous encouragement , kazuyuki omukai for showing detailed technical treatment used in omukai ( 2001 ) , shu - ichiro inutsuka for discussion about the rarefied filament model .",
    "we also acknowledge the referee for improving the manuscript .",
    "according to omukai ( 2001 ) , opacity is determined by cross section , partition function , and reduced mass .",
    "cross section is the same one that we consider in photoreactions .",
    "reduced mass is estimated easily . according to bron et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , the ratio of the partition function of @xmath17 to that of @xmath4 is estimated .",
    "about @xmath74 , the partition function @xmath320 is @xmath321 where @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 . hence @xmath326",
    "the integrated value of equation ( 14 ) can be approximated by @xmath327 where @xmath328 .",
    "error is smaller than 10@xmath172 .",
    "neglecting the effect of kinetic energy and pressure in equation ( 1 ) with @xmath329 we have @xmath330 where @xmath36 is constant . from equation ( a5 ) , @xmath331 is the quadratic function of @xmath332 .",
    "hence we can express @xmath333 ( @xmath334 , @xmath335 , and @xmath336 are constant ) .",
