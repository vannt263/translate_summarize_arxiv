    "in this paper we compute the temperature - dependence of the pole mass of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryons using effective lagrangians and large @xmath1 methods .",
    "there are two main motivations for this work .",
    "the first comes from relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "these are very complex phenomena , and the extraction of physically interesting quantities from the experimentally accessible information necessarily involves a good deal of modelling .",
    "most likely , a number of measurable quantities will have to be correlated to constrain the ones of physical interest .",
    "clearly , an understanding of the parameters of these models within controlled approximations will simplify this process .",
    "the dependence of particle properties on the temperature is one such parameter .",
    "the second motivation is more theoretical .",
    "the finite temperature properties of hadrons provide clues to the mechanism of confinement / chiral symmetry breaking which is expected to occur at @xmath11 .",
    "below this critical temperature , we can use effective lagrangian methods to gain some information about the finite - temperature dependence of qcd quantities .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath12pt ) is the effective low - energy theory of hadrons and gives rise to a systematic expansion in powers of the light current quark masses @xmath13 and kinematic scales @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the chiral expansion scale .",
    "all the information contained in qcd is encapsulated in a few phenomenological constants , that have to be determined by experiment .",
    "an essential result is that at a given order in the expansion one has to compute only diagrams with a finite number of loops depending on a finite number of couplings  @xcite .",
    "tree diagrams correspond to current algebra results , of which @xmath12pt can be viewed as a systematic extension to all orders .",
    "formulated originally for the goldstone bosons @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , it was later extended to include the low - lying baryons  @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial aspect of this extension is the presence of a new scale , the baryon mass , that does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "this appears to spoil the scaling arguments used to get the relation between number of loops and powers of quark mass ( or momentum ) .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem is given by heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath12pt )  @xcite , which treats the baryon as a static particle .",
    "corrections suppressed by powers of the baryon mass appear as higher - order vertices in the effective lagrangian .",
    "since the baryon mass appears only in vertices , the chiral counting manifestly goes through and the relation between the number of loops and powers of quark mass is recovered .",
    "one difficulty with hb@xmath12pt is the large number of phenomenological constants appearing in the effective lagrangian .",
    "another one is the presence of @xmath19 states close to the nucleons ( @xmath20 mev ) .",
    "there are different prescriptions for dealing with the decuplet states : some authors include them as explicit degrees of freedom ( treating the the decuplet  octet mass difference either perturbatively or to all orders ) , while others keep only the nucleon fields and consider only processes at energies low enough to avoid exciting the decuplet states . the @xmath0 expansion ( where @xmath1 is the number of qcd colors ) alleviates both of these problems  @xcite .",
    "it relates the value of some phenomenological constants , allowing one to go further in the chiral expansion .",
    "also , in the @xmath0 expansion there is a whole tower of degenerate baryon states with spins @xmath21 with mass differences between low - lying spin multiplets suppressed by @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion therefore forces us to include the decuplet as explicit degrees of freedom , and ( after deciding how to book @xmath0 corrections compared to chiral corrections ) the treatment of the decuplet ",
    "octet splitting is determined .",
    "another appealing aspect of the @xmath0 expansion is that the intuitive and phenomenologically successfull static quark model arises as its leading term  @xcite . hb@xmath12pt",
    "together with the @xmath0 expansion has been used to compute a number of quantities sucessfully  @xcite . in particular , a discussion of the zero temperature baryon mass differences at next - to - leading order will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .    at temperatures",
    "@xmath4 well below the critical temperature @xmath22 mev , we expect a description of a qcd plasma in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom to be justified .",
    "since most particles will have kinetic energies of order @xmath4 or smaller , their interactions will be soft and we expect that @xmath12pt will give an accurate description of the dynamics . particles with high energy or large masses are exponentially suppressed by boltzmann factors and can be safely ignored .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the thermodynamics of a gas of pions to compute the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate .",
    "the properties of baryons in a thermal plasma are affected by the background of thermal pions . in this paper",
    "we compute the leading order temperature dependence of the pole mass of octet and decuplet baryons using hb@xmath12pt and the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain the power counting that selects the class of diagrams contributing to the leading order temperature baryon pole mass dependence . in section iii the results are presented and discussed .",
    "the chiral limit is briefly considered in section iv where a few comparisons with previous results are made . finally , in section v the main results are summarised and comments on the range of validity of our approach are presented .",
    "the calculation will involve the real time formalism ( rtf ) for finite temperature field theory and the formalism presented in  @xcite for large @xmath1 heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "here we confine ourselves to defining the notation used , leaving the details to the references .",
    "the complications caused by the presence of a matrix structure in the propagators in the rtf  @xcite is offset by the fact that it is easy to sepatate the temperature - dependent contributions from the zero temperature part .",
    "the propagator for the ( static ) baryon with velocity @xmath23 ( taken to be the same as the plasma velocity ) is    [ eq:1all ] @xmath24\\ ,     \\label{eq1:a}\\\\     s_{22}(x)&= & \\int \\dk e^{-ikx }     ~\\left[-{1\\over v\\cdot k - i\\epsilon }        + 2\\pi i n_f(m+v\\cdot k)\\delta(v\\cdot k)\\right]\\ ,     \\label{eq1:b}\\\\     s_{12}(x)&= & \\int \\dk e^{-ikx }     ~\\left[2\\pi i ( n_f(m+v\\cdot k )        - \\theta(-m - v\\cdot k))\\delta(v\\cdot k)\\right]\\ ,     \\label{eq1:c}\\\\     s_{21}(x)&= & \\int \\dk e^{-ikx }     ~\\left[2\\pi i ( n_f(m+v\\cdot k )         - \\theta(m+v\\cdot k))\\delta(v\\cdot k)\\right]\\ ,     \\label{eq1:d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the meson propagator is    [ eq:2all ] @xmath25\\ ,      \\label{eq2:a}\\\\              d_{22}(x)&= & \\int \\dk e^{-ikx }      ~\\left[-{1\\over k^2-m^2-i\\epsilon }             - 2\\pi i n(v\\cdot k)\\delta(k^2-m^2)\\right]\\ ,       \\label{eq2:b}\\\\       d_{12}(x)&= & -\\int \\dk e^{-ikx }       ~\\left [ 2\\pi i ( n(v\\cdot k ) + \\theta(-v\\cdot k))\\delta(k^2-m^2)\\right]\\ ,       \\label{eq2:c}\\\\                 d_{21}(x)&= & -\\int \\dk e^{-ikx }          ~\\left[2\\pi i ( n(v\\cdot k ) + \\theta(v\\cdot k))\\delta(k^2-m^2)\\right]\\ ,             \\label{eq2:d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the bosonic ( fermionic ) distribution function @xmath28 the indices @xmath29 refer to the the matrix structure of the rtf propagator needed to describe the expectation value of operators in a mixed state . note the presence of the large baryon mass @xmath30 in the distribution function @xmath31 .",
    "they appear because , in hb@xmath12pt , the momentum in the propagator  ( [ eq:1all ] ) is the residual momentum @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the physical momentum  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the range of temperatures considered here , the temperature - dependent part of the baryon propagator is suppressed by a tiny boltzmann factor and can be safely dropped . to a lesser extent ,",
    "the same is true for @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons : since @xmath34 at @xmath35 mev , we will count thermal kaon and eta loops as addionally suppressed in the chiral counting . in the present leading order calculation",
    "this means they will also be dropped .    in the large-@xmath1 world",
    ", the low lying baryons form an infinite tower of flavor multiplets with spin @xmath21 .",
    "we follow the formalism and notation of refs .",
    "@xcite where they are all treated simultaneously by defining a field acting on a spin  flavor fock space @xmath36 where @xmath37 are flavor indices and @xmath38 are spin indices .",
    "the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are ( bosonic ) creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the effective lagrangian then has the standard form @xmath41 where the braces around a generic operator stand for @xmath42 @xmath43 is built from the quark mass matrix @xmath30 @xmath44 and @xmath45where @xmath46 parametrizes the goldstone bosons @xmath47 and @xmath48 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "the main result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the coefficient of an @xmath49-body operator in the effective lagrangian above has a coefficient which is @xmath50 for large @xmath1 .",
    "this comes about because , at the qcd level , an exchange of @xmath51 gluons is necessary to produce a term in the effective lagrangian involving @xmath49 quarks .",
    "this is true even when the number of light quark flavors @xmath52 is taken to be of order @xmath1 , since this rule does not rely in the suppresion of quark loops  @xcite . for @xmath53 , the size of the flavor representations of the low lying baryons with given @xmath54 grow with @xmath55 and it is not obvious which of those states should be identified with the states of the real @xmath56 world .",
    "our procedure will be to compute the mass shifts keeping all terms that are of the order desired in _",
    "any _ state in the large @xmath55 flavor multiplet .",
    "only then those terms are evaluated with @xmath57 .",
    "because we take @xmath58 , a decision has to be made about how to extrapolate the quark mass matrix to arbitrary number of flavors .",
    "we choose the most general form @xmath59 and keep all terms that are of the desired order in any extrapolation in which @xmath60 .",
    "now we can establish the rules for power counting .",
    "we take @xmath61 to be of the same order as a strange quark mass @xmath62 .",
    "the light quark masses @xmath63 are counted as @xmath64 . as mentioned above , kaon and eta thermal loops",
    "are suppressed by large boltzman factors compared to pion thermal loops , and are therefore negligible in this expansion .",
    "this suppression however , does not become exact in the chiral or large @xmath55 limit . to account for this numerical fact",
    "we take the practical attitude of counting those loops as additionally suppressed by a factor @xmath64 . summarizing , @xmath65",
    "let us now look at the graphs giving the leading temperature dependent contributions to the baryon mass .",
    "first , consider the graph in fig .  1 .",
    "the tick on the meson propagator denotes the temperature dependent part of the propagator .",
    "this graph contains two one - body vertices , and two powers of @xmath66 in the denominator .",
    "since @xmath67 and the matrix element of any @xmath68body operator is at most @xmath69 , using dimensional analysis we can see that this graph is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a some dimensionless function .",
    "for @xmath72 we have @xmath73 , so this graph is booked as @xmath74 .",
    "an explicit calculation shows , however , that @xmath75 vanishes .    the graphs in fig .",
    "2 , with an arbitrary number @xmath76 of mass insertions of the form @xmath77 are of the order @xmath78 ( since @xmath79 ) .",
    "the sum of these graphs therefore gives the leading contribution to the temperature mass shift .",
    "note that navely , the diagram in fig .",
    "2 with one insertion of the operator @xmath80 is of order @xmath81 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that baryon masses are proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "when wave function renormalization terms are included however , there is a cancellation that decreases this result by two powers of @xmath1 , making this contribution not only consistent with large @xmath1 expectations , but actually negligible at leading order in our expansion .",
    "we assume that similar cancellations ( necessary for the consistency of large @xmath1 qcd ) occur so that no contribution grows faster than @xmath82 .",
    "this has been checked in various non trivial cases  @xcite .    using similar arguments",
    ", one can check that other graphs including @xmath0 suppressed or higher derivative vertices , as well as light quark mass insertions and higher loop graphs are also of higher order .",
    "thus , the leading contribution for the temperature dependent part of the pole mass is given by the simple one loop graph with the baryon propagator resummed to include the ( zero temperature ) octet - decuplet mass splitting . since",
    "this graph is to be evaluated at the tree level mass shell ( including the effects of the term @xmath83 ) , the external momentum will cancel against the mass in the propagator if both the internal and external particles , have the same spin .",
    "when this happens the graph with the resummed propagator is exactly equal to the graph in fig .  1 , which vanishes .",
    "thus , the only intermediate states that contribute to the octet temperature mass shifts are decuplet intermediate states , and _ vice - versa_.",
    "the calculation of the graph in fig .  2 with the resummed propagator is straighforward .",
    "keeping only the temperature dependent part we have @xmath84\\ , { \\cal x}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 are @xmath86 generators and @xmath87 is a projection operator @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the projection operator for octet masses , which projects onto decuplet intermediate states ; _ vice versa _ for the decuplet masses .",
    "the upper(lower ) sign in (  [ eq : result ] ) applies to the octet ( decuplet ) and @xmath90 is the operator @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the strangeness matrix in flavor space .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath93 in different states is @xmath94 the zero value for @xmath95 reflects the fact that the @xmath96 interactions with the background pions involve the annihilation of two quarks into gluons that then turn into the quark making up the pion , which is a @xmath61 suppressed process .",
    "the integral in (  [ eq : result ] ) is to be understood in the principal value sense .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath97 is related to the usual octet axial couplings @xmath98 and @xmath99 , as well as the axial couplings to the decuplet states . in the large-@xmath1 and @xmath86 limits we can identify as @xmath100 , which is also the value obtained by performing a best fit at leading order . in fig .",
    "3 we show the dependence of the real part of the nucleon pole mass as a function of temperature .",
    "( the temperature dependence dependence for other octet baryons is a multiple of the same graph . )",
    "a striking feature is that it is very small until @xmath101  mev , and then varies rapidly .",
    "the shift in the mass of the @xmath6 is opposite to the nucleon , so that the mass splitting between then decreases rapidly in the range @xmath102 .",
    "this fact may be used to predict relative yields of different baryon species in central rapidity region of relativistic heavy ion collisions . assuming that the number baryons of a given kind is given , in first approximation , by the fermi distribution at the freeze out temperature",
    ", the relative yields of two baryons will be a function of their mass splittings . as a correction to this model",
    ", it is natural to use the temperature dependent masses in the fermi distribution ( the precise sense in which this gives the leading correction will be the subject of a future publication ) . it may be possible then to test our predictions by measuring ratios of the number of different baryons species .",
    "it is not clear however that this simple freeze out models are accurate within @xmath7 so that the relatively small mass shifts can be observed .",
    "the imaginary part of the pole is shown in fig .  4 . note that this width can be caused not only by the decay of the incoming particle , but by other processes without counterpart at zero temperature , such as the absorbtion of a pion from the thermal background  @xcite ; even stable particles can have a finite width at nonzero temperature .",
    "for the temperatures where we expect @xmath12pt to be reliable , say , @xmath103 mev , the width of the nucleons is small compared to their masses , and they therefore behave as sharp , well - defined states .",
    "a hint of deconfinement is found when the residue of the baryon poles @xmath104 is calculated .",
    "this computation is very similar to the one presented above , the main difference being that now that both the octet and the decuplet contribute for all states .",
    "for example , the nucleon residue @xmath104 changes by an ammount @xmath105 where @xmath106 at @xmath35 mev , for instance , the residue is reduced by @xmath107 in relation to the zero temperature value , and decreases very fast with higher temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that the baryon poles disappear at high temperature .",
    "it is customary to consider the chiral limit where the quark masses vanish when using chiral models at finite tempertaure .",
    "this limit has the theoretically pleasing feature that the only mass scales in the problem are the temperature @xmath4 and the chiral expansion scale , and all quantities have a power series expansion in @xmath4 .",
    "we note here , however , that this limit is usefull when @xmath108 , which is not of great phenomenological interest given the fact that the critical temperature is numerically close to the pion mass .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth considering this limit as a consistency check . in the chiral limit @xmath109 , our main result eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) is @xmath110 \\,{\\cal x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is not a power series in @xmath4 even in the chiral limit because of the presence of the additional mass scale @xmath111 ( the decuplet  octet mass difference ) .",
    "it becomes a power series in @xmath4 in the limit @xmath112 , in which case the baryon mass shift vanishes .",
    "it also becomes a power series when @xmath113 , corresponding to decoupling the decuplet states ; this is the limit which corresponds to `` pure '' hb@xmath12pt . in this limit",
    ", we obtain @xmath114 this is consistent with a general theorem that states that there is no contribution at order @xmath115 in the chiral limit .",
    "this is also in a agreement with the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which used a relativistic effective lagrangian for the baryons and concluded that there are no contributions to the baryon mass at order @xmath115 in the chiral limit .",
    "we have computed the temperature dependence of the pole mass of baryons in leading order in hb@xmath12pt and the @xmath0 expansion for temperatures @xmath116 . the full dependence on the temperature and on the octet ",
    "decuplet mass difference is included , as dictated by large-@xmath1 and chiral power counting .",
    "the shifts in mass were of the order of @xmath117 , at @xmath118 mev , and the changes in width are about the same size .",
    "the range of temperatures where our results are applicable are limited by both the chiral expansion ( which breaks down at energies of the order of qcd scales , like the rho mass ) and by the existence of heavier resonances .",
    "the effect of virtual loops of these heavy particles at zero temperature are included in the value of the phenomenological coefficients of the effective lagrangian .",
    "although such particles are also present in the thermal plasma , they are suppressed by large boltzmann factors at low temperatures , but at higher temperatures , they will become important .",
    "it is important to realize that the large-@xmath1 expansion entered in the present calculation in a rather non - essencial way .",
    "as long as we decide to include the decuplet as a propagating field , consider the octet - decuplet splitting of the order @xmath119 , and use a value for the octet - decuplet coupling constant consistent with its large-@xmath1 value , our results are essentially unaltered .",
    "only a numerically very small term was dropped ( since it was @xmath0 suppressed ) in arriving at (  [ eq : result ] ) .",
