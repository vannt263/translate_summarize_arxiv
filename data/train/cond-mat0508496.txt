    "quantum critical points ( qcp ) separating ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic states from paramagnetic fermi liquid states in strongly correlated electron systems have been investigated for decades .",
    "successful descriptions of quantum critical behavior were provided by the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of spin fluctuations @xcite for @xmath16-electron systems based on the hubbard model .",

    ", it has been hypothesized that the same qcp as the @xmath16-electron itinerant antiferromagnet , referred to as spin density wave ( sdw ) type qcp , is relevant to the heavy fermion qcp @xcite .",
    "however despite a number of experimental studies of heavy - fermion systems showing non - fermi liquid behavior , none of them definitively supports this qcp @xcite .",
    "this stems partly from experimental difficulty in measuring weakly divergent quantities around a qcp , especially for bulk properties , which has been also the case for @xmath16-electron itinerant antiferromagnets @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "several recent experiments suggest the possibility of a novel strong coupling picture of the qcp @xcite . among these studies ,",
    "single - crystalline neutron scattering investigations of the heavy fermion cecu@xmath1au@xmath2 provided interesting insight @xcite . on the basis of the observed @xmath0-scaling with an anomalous exponent @xcite , and effective two space dimensions @xcite , a scenario of a locally critical qcp was proposed @xcite . in this work ,",
