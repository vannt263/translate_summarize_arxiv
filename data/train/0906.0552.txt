    "one of the most intriguing observations made over the years in financial data analysis concerns the tendency of financial forecasters to imitate each other .",
    "an account of this phenomenon is found in @xcite , where earning forecasts from different markets over a 17 year period are analyzed , showing ( among other results ) that : ( a ) forecasts are typically optimistic , that is the difference between the forecast and the actual earning is positive on average ; and ( b ) the spread of forecasts among analysts is significantly smaller on average than the forecast error , i.e. the typical spread of forecasts around the real earning . in other words ,",
    "analysts forecasts are more similar to each other than they are to the variable they are trying to forecast .",
    "more recently , a similar data set has been studied to estimate the fraction of herding analysts @xcite , with the surprising conclusion that around 75% of the analysts in the data set displayed a marked tendency to herd as a forecasting strategy .",
    "interestingly , about 10% of analysts were instead found to be anti - herding .",
    "stock prices in turn tend to react more strongly to forecasts that differ from the consensus ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent study ) .    while psychological factors like social pressure , reputation issues and ( for anti - herding ) a desire for visibility can be crucial in determining this scenario , it is quite difficult to explain these results within the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) . in the emh world , one would expect different forecasters to use their respective partial information to produce a proxy for the target variable that is unbiased and such that the forecast dispersion and the forecast error are roughly the same , as would result from forecasters that are independent and fully heterogeneous with respect to information and forecasting ability .",
    "different models in the economic literature have addressed the problem of the origin of herding behavior among financial forecasters in a bayesian game theoretic setting ( see e.g. @xcite ) , proving that if an analyst aims at maximizing the value of his reputation with investors ( or the chances that investors believe he s a good forecaster ) then it may actually be more profitable for him to replicate other agents forecasts rather than putting forward a guess based on his private information . a recent agent - based model proposed by curty and marsili @xcite focuses instead on the limits that herding imposes on the efficiency with which information is aggregated .",
    "specifically , it was shown that when the fraction of herders in a population of agents increases , the probability that herding produces the correct forecast ( i.e. that individual information bits are correctly aggregated ) undergoes a transition to a state in which either all herders forecast rightly , or no herder does .    in this note",
    "we study a variation on the theme by curty and marsili , aiming at characterizing further the dynamical interplay between learning and heterogeneity of information in a population of agents aiming to predict a continuous exogenous random variable ( learning was briefly considered in a discrete forecasting setting also in @xcite ) . at each time step",
    ", every agent is required to formulate a forecast either using his private information or by herding with a group of peers and selects the strategy to adopt based on his past performance .",
    "we show that the structure of the agents choices changes significantly depending on the heterogeneity of information .",
    "in particular , herding becomes increasingly preferred by agents as information becomes more and more unevenly spread across the population .",
    "however , the herding coefficient ( measured by the ratio of the forecast error to the forecast dispersion ) peaks roughly where informational inhomogeneity is maximal , implying that learning in such conditions does not allow for an efficient aggregation of the available information .",
    "the results we discuss are mostly obtained by computer simulations .",
    "deeper analytical progress ( beyond the simple considerations made here ) could be possible either along the lines of @xcite or by reasonably simplifying the coupled herding and learning mechanisms .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a population of agents ( labeled @xmath2 ) who have to forecast at each time step @xmath3 a continuous random variable @xmath0 drawn independently at each @xmath4 from a uniform distribution in @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the forecast @xmath6 of agent @xmath7 at time @xmath4 is taken to be correct if @xmath8 , in which case we shall write @xmath9 . in",
    "what follows , the resolution parameter @xmath10 will be fixed to the value @xmath11 so as to focus the study on the remaining parameters . in order to fomulate his forecast , every agent must choose between using his private information ( strategy lebeled @xmath12 ) and herding ( label @xmath13 ) .",
    "in the former case , agents simply propose a forecast @xmath14 which is correct with probability @xmath15 , initially unknown to @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is the probability with which a random uniform guess in @xmath5 $ ] is within @xmath10 from @xmath0 , hence we are assuming that the private information has better - than - random predictive power .",
    "larger values of @xmath17 correspond to higher forecasting abilities .",
    "we assume , along the lines of @xcite , that the @xmath17 s are sampled independently from @xmath18\\label{distr}\\ ] ] tuning @xmath19 one passes from a situation in which almost all agents are well informed ( small @xmath19 ) , to one in which almost all agents have no forecasting ability ( large @xmath19 ) ; as @xmath19 increases , the information heterogeneity ( or the a priori forecasting ability ) reaches a maximum when @xmath20 , corresponding to a uniform distribution .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath21 the average value of @xmath17 , given by @xmath22 .",
    "when herding , an agent uses instead a prediction @xmath23 obtained by pooling a group @xmath24 of @xmath25 peers chosen randomly and uniformly for each @xmath7 ( our results do not appear to depend significantly on @xmath25 as long as @xmath25 is not extensive ; we shall use @xmath26 here ) .",
    "this represents , in analogy with e.g. @xcite , the `` contact network '' of the agent . our choice for a plain erds - renyi topology parallels that made in @xcite , but results",
    "are expected to change if different topologies are employed .",
    "the herding forecast is defined as the fixed point of the iterative process @xmath27 with @xmath28 . in words , at time step @xmath4 every agent only interacts with his peers whose initial ( private ) guess is sufficiently close , within a range measured by @xmath29 , to his @xcite .",
    "the `` effective interaction range '' is a crucial parameter to model social interaction and has proved to play a non trivial role in other contexts @xcite .",
    "note that the number @xmath30 of such peers is obviously bounded by @xmath25 but it fluctuates in time ; furthermore , in the above sum @xmath31 denotes the forecast of agent @xmath32 who may be herding ( in which case @xmath33 changes with @xmath34 ) or not ( in which case it is fixed to @xmath35 ) .",
    "this defines a dynamical `` imitation network '' onto the contact network , close in spirit to that defined in @xcite in the context of minority games . in this case , however , the averaging operation through which herding is performed does not allow for a straightforward identification of an imitation hierarchy .    as in many other instances of games with learning @xcite",
    ", we take agents to be inductive : they monitor the performances of their two strategies over time via scoring functions indexed by @xmath36 that are updated in time according to @xmath37 and the agent s chosen strategy @xmath38 is selected by a logit rule with learning rate @xmath39 : @xmath40 the different parameters appearing above have all been introduced and discussed at length in the context of minority games and related models ( see e.g. @xcite for a broad review ) . in the present case , @xmath41 denotes a memory length parameter , roughly corresponding to the inverse of the time scale over which agents preserve a memory of the past performance of their strategies .",

    "@xmath43 denotes the profit faced by agent @xmath7 at time step @xmath4 . for the sake of simplicity , we reward agents who guess correctly with one point , while we take one point from agents who guessed incorrectly .",
    "finally , @xmath44 is a parameter that encodes for a tunable stochasticity in the agents choice rules , with deterministic behavior recovered for @xmath45 .",
    "note that at every time step both the strategy scores of every agent are updated .",
    "starting from initial conditions @xmath46 , we are interested in observing the steady state behavior of the following quantities :    * the herding probability , measured by the time - averaged fraction of herders : @xmath47 * the probability of success of strategy @xmath13 ( averaged over time and agents ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 if the event @xmath50 is true , and zero otherwise * the time- and agent - averaged forecast error : @xmath51 * the time - averaged forecast dispersion : @xmath52 * the _ herding ratio _",

    "we remind , finally , that , under the emh , @xmath55 , so one would expect @xmath56 .",
    "we begin by analyzing the case in which every agent consults all his peer group ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 for all times ) , has infinite score memory ( @xmath59 ) and learning rate ( @xmath60 , corresponding to a deterministic choice rule ) and faces no costs ( or receives no incentives ) to use his strategies ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "on the other hand , when agents have limited predictive ability , they learn to use their private signal as it slightly outperforms the herding forecast .",
    "this behavior , including the decay of @xmath62 that is observed for large @xmath19 ( @xmath66 as @xmath67 ) essentially parallels that observed in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath63 , by contrast , displays a sharp drop as informational heterogeneity increases beyond the point where , as is clear from the inset , the private signal outperforms herding .",
    "note that for large @xmath19 sample - to - sample fluctuations become larger and larger as @xmath68 , so that realizations with many herders ( up to a 70% fraction of the population ) coexist with realizations with few herders ( less than 10% ) .",

    "we remind , information heterogeneity is maximal ) , @xmath77 is instead closer to the emh limit @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests that inductive agents indeed manage to aggregate information quite efficiently when it is distributed uniformly across them , regardless of the quality of the information .",
    "this process is no longer possible in presence of a more diversified information landscape .",
    "a naive analytical estimate of the value of @xmath19 where the game undergoes a crossover can be obtained by arguing as in @xcite . denoting by @xmath79 the probability of a correct forecast",

    "( [ bstar ] ) also characterizes the role of the resolution parameter : as @xmath10 increases , the number of effective alternative `` states '' of the variable @xmath0 ( given by @xmath87 ) decreases and @xmath88 becomes larger , extending the range of effectiveness of herding as a forecasting strategy .",
    "( the fact that @xmath10 can not exceed @xmath89 was implicit in the model s definition . )    note that the nave guess for the fraction of herders given by @xcite @xmath90 according to which agents with @xmath91 are assumed to herd asymptotically , does not produce the correct results in the present model , suggesting that the specific forms of @xmath63 and of its fluctuations , including the large @xmath19 increase , are likely due to the learning dynamics itself .",

    "similar conclusions can be reached by analyzing the learning rate @xmath44 that tunes the amount of stochasticity in agents choice .",
    "its impact appears to be most remarkable close to @xmath20 , when a ( small ) degree of randomness in the strategy selection process helps to reduce the fraction of herders and hence to bring @xmath77 closer to the rational value of @xmath1 .",

    "for other values of the parameter , instead , the sum in is restricted only to agents whose forecasts are within @xmath29 from each agent s initial choice .",
    "it is interesting to note that when herding represents the best strategy , i.e. around @xmath20 , the fraction of herders is almost insensitive to different values of @xmath29 ( which possibly suggests also a weak dependence of the results on @xmath25 ) . nevertheless reducing @xmath29",
    "the herding ratio appears to get smaller , indicating that a more rational aggregation of information may occur .",
    "by contrast , for larger @xmath19 agents may be unable to identify @xmath12 as the most likely successful strategy if @xmath29 is too small .",
    "coming finally to the incentives @xmath103 ( which are known to have a far from trivial impact on minority games , see e.g. @xcite ) , we focus on the dependence of @xmath63 on the parameter @xmath104 , which is easily understood to be the relevant quantity in this case .",

    "the quality of the information at an agent s disposal is measured by the a priori predictive ability of his private signal , and we investigate how the game s overall properties are affected by increasing informational heterogeneity in the population .",
    "our main result is that inductive agents may be unable to produce rational forecasts when the heterogeneity is large . in this situation ,",
    "the herding ratio becomes significantly larger than one , taking on values similar to those measured empirically in the financial literature @xcite .",
    "we have also observed that the efficacy of herding depends strongly on the distribution of information .",
    "the role of several parameters of interest in the context of games with inductive agents has finally bee analyzed .",
    "generically speaking , a finite learning rate , a shorter memory or a smaller interaction range may all contribute to reduce the herding ratio when the informational heterogeneity is large .",
    "the interest in forecasting games is based on the fact that they present a simple outlook and a rich phenomenology that allows to shed some light on the process of information aggregation and its limits .",
    "it is however difficult to establish a direct contact between these toy models and financial markets , which still represent the main source of empirical data .",
    "one possible step in this direction that is worth exploring would consist in coupling the event to be forecasted , @xmath0 here , with the agents choices , as done for example in @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 would play in these models the role of a ` price ' . depending on the form of the payoff one",
    "would then observe a dynamical feedback between learning and ` price ' leading to a rich outlook possibly similar to that studied in minority games ."
