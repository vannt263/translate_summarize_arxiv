    "zno - ge and sio2-ge nanocomposites are intensively studied for their possible use as optoelectronic devices @xcite . a common method for preparing these systems",
    "is by alternate deposition of oxides and ge , followed by an annealing process to increase the diffusion of nanocrystalites ( nc ) into the adjacent layers@xcite .",
    "this process leads also to homogenize the sizes and spacial dispersion of ncs .",
    "it is widely known that the photoluminescense - spectra shift is strongly related to nc s size .",
    "although there have been several attempts to understand the relation between the morphology and the photoluminescence ( pl ) response of embedded nc in oxide matrices @xcite , none of them lead to a simple and precise explanation .",
    "the purpose of this work is to understand and to explain this relation from a simple model and a few physical parameters .    to calculate the optical response of these rather complex systems , we use both",
    "the _ bona fide _ multiple - quantum - well electron and hole eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , obtained from the theory of finite periodical systems@xcite ( tfps ) and a simple assumption , experimentally supported , on the statistical distributions of nc sizes .",
    "we show that the main features of the pl spectra ( in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 doped @xmath1 films annealed at several temperatures ) , can clearly be identified in terms of the interband excitonic transitions calculated for multiple quantum well ( mqw ) systems , whose well and barrier parameters are drawn from the experimental system .",
    "the agreement with other kind of experimental results , as those reported by by s. takeoka et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 nc in @xmath2 , is also good when the nanocrystals - size dispersion is taken into account .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we observe micrographs of ge cristalites embedded in a zno matrix . at low nc densities",
    "we have almost isolated ncs ( see fig [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , while at higher nc densities one can find groups of ncs aligned and almost equidistant(see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) . although a single nc can be better modeled as a quantum dot , the relevance of the longitudinal coherence in the energy spectra of a sequence of ncs , leads us to model the sequence as a multiple 1d - quantum well potential .",
    "each of these sequences is then treated as a finite periodic square - well potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) ) , and the whole nanocomposite pl response results from the contribution of an ensemble of mqws , which differ basically in the number of ncs , well - widths and barrier - thicknesses .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) we have a mqw potential for a given set of parameters .",
    "we show the energy spectra ( in the conduction and valence bands ) , and the square of the wave function amplitude @xmath3 for the first energy level in the first conduction ( valence ) subband . in the tfps , these quantities can easily be calculated .",
    "the eigenvalues are obtained from @xcite @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the electron or hole effective mass .",
    "the wave functions at any point @xmath7 in the @xmath8-th cell ( for a system of length @xmath9 ) and energy @xmath10 are given by @xmath11 .",

    "for these wave functions the electron and hole are localized inside the qw s .",

    "we also show the corresponding nc s average diameter used for the theoretical model.,width=432 ]        . in the middle our theoretical curves , and at the right image",

    "in fig . [ fig2 ] ( b ) we present the experimental pl spectra of @xmath0-doped @xmath1 films for different annealing temperatures , reported in ref .",
    "the nc s average diameter increases with the annealing temperature @xcite .",
    "the peaks position in these pl curves can be described in terms of the energy spectra of a single sequence of ncs . for this calculation",
    "we use the potential and gap parameters corresponding to the @xmath23 point of @xmath1 and the annealing temperature , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 .",
    "the black arrows point out the theoretical predictions for different possible recombination transitions . in this figure",
    ", the assignment @xmath30 refers to the energy transitions @xmath31 .",
    "it is well known that increasing the well width @xmath32 , the subbands move towards lower energies while their number increases .",
    "we notice in the the experimental pl curves that increasing @xmath32 the small peaks shift toward larger wave lengths , while the main pl peak displaces in the opposite direction .",
    "this behavior is even much clear in the experimental results of takeoka eta al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the secondary - peaks structure is absent .    in these systems",
    "the experimental curves arise from the contribution of a large number of ncs which sizes are statistically distributed@xcite .",
    "the pl aspect and peaks relative - height depend not only on the potential parameters , but also on their statical distribution .",
    "the pl response of a single mqw in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , shows the red - shift with @xmath32 and the high pl sensitivity to small barrier - thickness variations .    to explain the experimental results reported by takeoka et al . in ref @xcite for @xmath0 ncs in a @xmath33 matrix ,",
    "we need to take into account also the nc s size distribution . we assume , according with the experimental results , that the size distribution is described by a log - normal function .",
    "we then calculate the pl spectra of several sets of nc diameters , pondered by their statistical weight .",
    "since the pl peaks position is less sensitive to the number of wells and to the nc spacing , we assume for this case a fixed barrier width and also a fixed number of cells .    at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) we present the experimental results from ref . @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) we show our calculated curves assuming up to @xmath34 contributing mqw sequences with the following parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36,@xmath37 , corresponding also to the @xmath23 point of @xmath2 . at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) , we plot also the peak position versus the ncs average diameter .",
    "this averaging procedure improves the agreement with the experimental pl spectra .",
    "the size - dispersion shifts the pl peaks toward lower energies .",
    "this is a consequence of the asymmetry of the log - normal distribution .    in our calculation",
    "we neglected _ e - h _ coulomb interaction corrections . in any case , they will produce small red shifts in the secondary pl peak positions and will be washed out in the main peak behavior .",
    "to explain the photoluminescence response of ncs embedded in oxide matrices as function of the average ncs diameter , we modeled these systems as a collection of 1-d multiple - quantum - well potentials . using the finite periodical systems theory and a simple nc - size distributions assumption , we shown that the calculated 1-d mqw subband transitions , describe correctly the secondary pl peaks behavior , observed by fan et al .",
    "@xcite , as function of the ncs diameter .",
    "we have shown also that the main pl peak blue - shift behavior , observed by takeoka et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , is basically determined by the statistical dispersion of the ncs diameter ."
