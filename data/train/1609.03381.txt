    "the electrostatic configuration @xmath51 in gate space @xmath79 vs @xmath80 was determined by calculating the lever arms , @xmath13 using a capacitance modelling program  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical tunnel rate map takes as an input the individual tunnel rates of the three qds to the set reservoir which , due to both their different distances from the set and donor numbers , are given approximately by @xmath81  hz , @xmath82  hz and @xmath83  hz ( obtained from experiment ) . in another work on the same device  @xcite the tunnel couplings between dots 1 and 2 and between dots 2 and 3",
    "were measured to be @xmath84  ghz and @xmath85  ghz respectively , which are much greater than any dot - reservoir rate .",
    "thus , as an input for the model it is sufficient to use a incoherent dot - dot rate that is much larger than any dot - reservoir rate in order to obtain the correct system dynamics , here we assume @xmath86 .",

    "importantly , the length of this pulse , @xmath92  ms , is longer than any dot - to - reservoir tunnelling time , thus always allowing the system to reach its ground state charge configuration .",

    "[ fig : theoryvsexpt]d .    in cases where at least one electron has tunnelled to the set during the first phase of the pulse cycle the set current will show an exponential change from which the experimental tunnel rate @xmath99 is extracted .",
    "note that , although theoretically multiple exponents of decay should be observed , in practice tunnelling will be dominated by the slowest rate , we therefore fit to a single exponential decay .",

    "as well as showing the direct dot - reservoir charge transitions apparent in the standard charge stability map in fig .",
    "[ fig : device]b , the tunnel rate map reproduces features that arise from indirect tunnelling pathways .    as we show below , because the tunnel rates of the individual qds to the set reservoir have the relationship @xmath100 , in some circumstances it will be favourable for electrons to tunnel via other qds as a means to reach the ground state in the shortest time possible , rather than tunnel directly to the set .",
    "importantly , whether or not these types of tunnelling paths are allowed depends on the relative positions of the qd chemical potentials , which can be calculated using the constant interaction model  @xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : theoryvsexpt]b .",
