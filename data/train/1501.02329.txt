    "optical frequency combs have been very useful scientific and technological tools in a wide range of applications such as optical clocks , precision spectroscopy , low phase noise microwave generation and optical communications . the general approach for producing frequency combs",
    "is based on mode - locking in lasers .",
    "an alternative approach has been recently demonstrated in a silica monolithic toroidal microresonator  @xcite , where cavity enhanced four - wave mixing ( fwm ) occurs . as a result , this type of comb using the third - order susceptibility in resonators is usually referred to as kerr optical frequency comb . the emergence of such combs provides a compact and energy efficient solution .",
    "therefore , extensive amount of works in both theories and experiments have been devoted to this field .",
    "for example , the understanding of the comb formation is now very elaborate , and involves both coupled - mode and spatiotemporal models  @xcite ; various applications have also been experimentally explored ranging from low phase noise microwave oscillations  @xcite , ultra - short pulse generation  @xcite , and optical communications  @xcite .    compared with kerr comb generation platforms based on chip - scale waveguide racetrack resonators  @xcite ,",
    "the mechanically polished disk resonators have a much wider range of material choices and can feature comb generation with very low pump power in the sub - mw level  @xcite , which results from the ultra - high quality ( @xmath5 ) factors and small mode volumes in these wgm resonators . although kerr frequency combs in fluoride wgm resonators have been demonstrated in the telecommunication window and recently at @xmath6 in the mid - ir regime  @xcite , there is still not a systematic study on the optimal choice of materials and the sizes of resonators .",
    "moreover , anomalous @xmath1 is generally desirable for comb generation and the spanning of kerr combs is also strongly dependent on the dispersion profile .",
    "recently , an analytical approximation for the dispersion of wgms in the disk geometry has been derived by two different groups , showing a good agreement with finite - element simulations and high - precision free spectral range ( fsr ) measurements  @xcite .",
    "it enables an accurate study of the impact of geometry on the @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "barium fluoride ( baf@xmath7 ) with a good transmission range covering the whole mid - ir window has been recently shown to be capable of supporting @xmath5 factors above @xmath0  @xcite , and this result broadens the choice of crystalline candidates for kerr comb generation .    in this article , we report the study of material dispersion for different ir and mid - ir optical materials using sellmeier equations .",
    "we point out that fluoride crystalline materials generally have significantly flatter material dispersion profile than other materials .",
    "a systematic and theoretical investigation of the impact of resonator geometry and wgm indices on the @xmath1 is carried out , showing that the major radii and the radial wgm indices are key parameters to consider for @xmath1 tailoring in wgm resonators .",
    "the impact of geometry on @xmath1 is also experimentally evidenced in an experiment showing how primary kerr combs with significantly different multiplicity can be generated with the same mgf@xmath7 resonator , but pumped in wgms with different radial orders .",
    "we also investigate theoretically mgf@xmath7 and baf@xmath7 platforms for potential broadband comb generations in the telecom and mid - ir regimes .",
    "is the primary parametric gain peak spacing from the pump frequency @xmath8.,width=340 ]    as far as kerr frequency comb generation is concerned , the primary step has been the search of the optimal materials .",
    "although the on - chip ring resonator as comb generation platforms is much more compact , mechanically polished high @xmath5 wgm crystalline resonators are still of great interest , due to the flexible choice of materials and ultra - high @xmath5 factors leading to power efficient operation .    in these axi - symmetric disk resonators ,",
    "the rim part can be treated as a toroidal boundary with the main radius @xmath9 and the curvature radius @xmath10 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ( a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] ( b ) gives a typical schematic drawing of kerr comb generation .",
    "a single frequency continuous - wave ( cw ) pump laser can be coupled into the wgmr through a fiber taper or a prism  @xcite . under certain conditions that have been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the built - up intracavity light leads to the modulation instability ( mi ) gain with offset @xmath11 from the pump frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the parametric fwm then creates the first two sidebands where wgms with single or multiple free spectral range ( @xmath12 ) relative to the pump mode meet the mi gain .",
    "subsequent parametric process creates a comb with multiple - fsr spacing , generally referred to as the _ primary comb_. depending on the dispersion and pump condition , broadband kerr combs with single - fsr spacing and thousands of frequency lines can be further produced . as kerr comb arises from mi",
    "gain , it thus prefers an anomalous dispersion profile similar to mi gain in optical fibers .",
    "in addition , the mi theory in kerr comb generation predicts that the offset @xmath11 of the parametric gain peak frequency scales with the dispersion following @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "hence , weak dispersion is generally favorable for broadband kerr comb generation .",
    "it should be noted that the primary kerr comb shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ( b ) also yields rolls ( or turing patterns ) in the spatial domain  @xcite .",
    "at this date , kerr optical frequency combs have been reported on wgm resonators made of fused silica , magnesium fluoride , calcium fluoride ( caf@xmath7 ) and sapphire  @xcite , which are all capable of featuring @xmath5 factors above @xmath0 . recently",
    ", such high @xmath5 factors have also been demonstrated on barium fluoride  @xcite .",
    "we thereby take into account this material with others for the investigation of the material dispersion ( @xmath14 ) using their sellmeier equations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 is usually characterized by group delay dispersion ( in ps / km / nm ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wavelength , @xmath17 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath18 is the refractive index .    ) , sapphire , mgf@xmath7 , caf@xmath7 and baf@xmath7 .",
    "dashed lines designate the corresponding @xmath19 : @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the vertical blue and brown zones highlight the telecommunication c - band and mid - ir windows .",
    "note that the @xmath14 profile of mgf@xmath7 investigated here is derived for the ordinary ray .",
    "the extraordinary one has very similar profile with a slightly different @xmath2 at @xmath24.,width=340 ]    figure  [ fig : dmaterial ] displays the corresponding material @xmath14 as a function of wavelength from 0.8 to 6  @xmath25 .",
    "it should be noted that the dispersion is anomalous when @xmath1 is greater than zero .",
    "a broadband comb generation will require a small @xmath1 value in this regime . on the other hand , a @xmath1 that is too large will also make kerr comb generation difficult , as the corresponding parametric gain could be too close to the pump frequency and do not meet any wgms ( the phase matching condition will therefore never be fulfilled ) .",
    "one can also see that fluoride materials have flatter dispersion profiles than the others .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 of these materials are listed in table  [ tab : material ] .",

    "this analysis has enabled us to demonstrate that the major radii of wgm resonators and the radial order indices are key parameters for dispersion tailoring . in particular , we have shown that the dispersion shift induced by selecting different radial families of modes in the same resonator allows for the generation of versatile combs .",
    "barium fluoride could benefit from this feature and it offers the best dispersion profile in the mid - ir spectral range .",
