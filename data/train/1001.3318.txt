    "let the polynomial map @xmath0 be the pinchuk map of total degree @xmath1 considered in @xcite .",

    "it is depicted below using differently scaled axes .",
    "it intersects the vertical axis at @xmath4 and @xmath5 and its leftmost point is @xmath6 .",
    ".,width=576,height=192 ]    this brief note will show that @xmath2 has the bijective polynomial parametrization by @xmath7 : @xmath8 @xmath9 and that its points satisfy the minimal equation @xmath10 in particular , only one point on the curve satisfies @xmath11 , and that point is its only singular point .",
    "also , there is a single point with @xmath12 which satisfies eqn ( 3 ) .",
    "that point is not on the curve itself , because eqn ( 1 ) implies @xmath13 , but belongs to its zariski closure .",
    "exactly parallel facts were established in @xcite for a different pinchuk map @xmath14 of total degree @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , any two pinchuk maps have essentially the same behavior and asymptotic variety , differing only by a triangular polynomial automorphism of the image plane .",
    "a parametrization of @xmath2 appeared in the unpublished preprint @xcite .",
    "the derivation is shortened here .",
    "@xmath16 is a useful reference example , because of the simplicity and low degree of the explicit equations for @xmath2 .",
    "pinchuk maps are certain polynomial maps @xmath17 that have an everywhere positive jacobian determinant @xmath18 , and are not injective @xcite .",
    "the polynomial @xmath19 is constructed by defining @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , so @xmath23 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath24 varies for different pinchuk maps , but always has the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an auxiliary polynomial in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , chosen so that @xmath29 .",
    "as in @xcite , choose specifically @xmath30 then @xmath31 .",
    "suppose @xmath32 is a different pinchuk map defined using @xmath33 .",
    "observe that @xmath34 lies in @xmath35 $ ] and satisfies @xmath36 , since @xmath37 .",
    "by @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2.25 ) , the subalgebra @xmath38 \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}[x , y]$ ] is generated by a single element . in @xmath35 $ ] that generator must be a degree @xmath39 polynomial in @xmath40 alone , since @xmath40 and @xmath28 are algebraically independent .",
    "so @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 for a triangular polynomial automorphism @xmath43 .",
    "the `` original '' pinchuk map of @xcite is defined by adding , not subtracting , @xmath44 , which is thus @xmath45 .",
    "clearly @xmath46 .",
    "note that no pinchuk map can have degree less than @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath40 has degree @xmath47 , and so , if @xmath48 , there is no way to cancel the terms of degree @xmath1 without introducing terms of yet higher degree .",
    "the points @xmath6 and @xmath4 of @xmath2 have no inverse image under @xmath16 , all other points of @xmath2 have one inverse image , and all points of the image plane not on @xmath2 have two .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if the two omitted points are deleted from @xmath2 , we are left with three curves .",
    "since the curves tend to infinity or to an omitted point at either end , their inverse images tend to infinity at both ends .",
    "so they partition their complement , @xmath49 , into four simply connected domains .",
    "these domains are mapped homeomorphically to their images , two each to the domains on either side of @xmath2 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath50 is a different pinchuk map , with asymptotic variety @xmath51 .",
    "from the definition of the asymptotic variety of a polynomial map as the set of finite limits of the map along curves that tend to infinity ( @xcite ) , or equivalently , the points at which the map is not proper ( @xcite ) , it follows that @xmath52 .",
    "the behavior is that of @xmath16 , up to the triangular automorphism @xmath53 of the image plane .",
    "also , note that the partition of the @xmath54-plane into three curves and four domains is exactly the same as for @xmath16 .. see @xcite for a graphic depiction .",
    "also from previously cited work , a general level set @xmath55 in the @xmath54-plane has a rational parametrization @xmath56 @xmath57 which can be obtained by solving @xmath58 for @xmath59 and then @xmath60 , and can be readily verified by substitution into the defining equations @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath61 does indeed simplify to just @xmath28 , and @xmath62 to just @xmath63 .",
    "temporarily ignore the special cases @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for which different parametrizations apply . at poles",
    "@xmath66 , it is easy to check that @xmath25 is infinite .",
    "indeed , @xmath67 and the dominant pole is @xmath68 with a nonzero numerator by the restriction on @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath28 tends to a pole @xmath69 we find that @xmath24 approaches a finite limit .",
    "the limit condition on @xmath63 and @xmath28 can also be stated as @xmath70 .",
    "this yields two points of @xmath2 on a vertical line @xmath55 when @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and no points when @xmath73 .    in more detail , @xmath74 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath69 , the expression simplifies to @xmath75 . here too , @xmath76 and @xmath77 by the restriction on @xmath63 , so the ratio is defined and equal to @xmath39 .",
    "this only means that as @xmath28 tends to such a pole , @xmath78 tends to @xmath39 . in the limit @xmath79 and thus @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath2 is closed in the euclidean topology , it contains the three sofar missing points with @xmath81 or @xmath82 and the same equations hold there by continuity .",
    "that is all of @xmath2 , because every point not obtained is , by section 3 , known not to be an asymptotic value of @xmath16 .",
    "the polynomial parametrization @xmath83 is clearly a bijection from @xmath84 onto @xmath2 .",
    "this works ( with the appropriate @xmath26 ) for any pinchuk map ; it is the form reported in @xcite .    using @xmath85 as a parameter instead and the specific auxiliary polynomial @xmath86 in eqn ( 4 ) yields eqn ( 1 ) and eqn ( 2 ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath87 simplifies the calculation of the gradient of the parametrization and of points on @xmath2 . from eqn ( 2 ) @xmath88 squaring both sides and substituting @xmath89 for @xmath90 yields eqn ( 3 ) .",
    "expand and rewrite eqn ( 3 ) as an implicit polynomial equation @xmath91 , quadratic in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath92 can not have a factor that is a nonconstant polynomial in @xmath40 , because the coefficient of @xmath93 in @xmath92 is @xmath39 .",
    "nor can @xmath92 have two factors linear in @xmath24 .",
    "at least one such factor , say @xmath94 for a polynomial @xmath95 , would have to be identically @xmath96 on @xmath2 , yet some vertical lines @xmath55 do not intersect @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath92 is irreducible and therefore its set of zeroes is the zariski closure of @xmath2 .",
    "ronen peretz championed a simpler way of finding parametrization equations such as eqn ( 1 ) and eqn ( 2 ) @xcite .",
    "a double asymptotic identity for @xmath16 is an equation @xmath97 for a rational ( but not polynomial ) map @xmath98 and a polynomial map @xmath99 .",
    "consider @xmath100 .",
    "as @xmath101 , the map @xmath102 is polynomial .    as @xmath59 tends to zero for a fixed @xmath60 , the point @xmath103 tends to infinity , describing a curve along which @xmath16 tends to the finite limit point @xmath104 .",
    "so @xmath105 is a parametrization of ( some of the points of ) @xmath2 .    comparing with the bijective parametrization by @xmath28 of the previous section , it is evident that this parametrization covers only the points @xmath106 .",
    "each such point is obtained twice , except for @xmath107 , where the parametrization reverses course .",
    "a similar parametrization covering the points @xmath108 of @xmath2 arises from the alternate choice of @xmath109 for @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the computations of the previous section can be recast into a rational identity of the form @xmath110 that provides the bijective parametrization .",
    "however , @xmath99 is not a polynomial map , but rather a rational map with @xmath104 defined for all but finitely many values of @xmath60 and polynomial in @xmath60 .",
    "the two exceptional values of @xmath60 correspond to the special cases @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "a weak jacobian conjecture for polynomial maps of @xmath111 to itself is that a keller map ( nonzero constant jacobian determinant ) is injective .",
    "this is weaker than the standard jacobian conjecture jc(2,@xmath84 ) , even though injectivity implies bijectivity here , because the inverse is not required to be a polynomial map .    _",
    "remark_. over @xmath112 this distinction does not exist , since any inverse map is birational and everywhere defined , hence polynomial . both conjectures for @xmath111 would follow from jc(2,@xmath112 ) .",
    "note that jc(2,@xmath84 ) is not known to imply jc(2,@xmath112 ) .    a general feature of the pinchuk map @xmath16 that conflicts with the keller condition is that radial similarity of newton polygons fails .",
    "@xmath113 , a quadrilateral , while @xmath114 , a five - sided polygon . for @xmath14 ,",
    "though , @xmath115 , a @xmath116-fold radial expansion of @xmath117 .",
    "all these polygons have no edge of negative slope .    for a nonsingular map @xmath118 , whether polynomial or not",
    ", @xmath119 is the rate of change of @xmath120 along the level curves of @xmath121 , parametrized as the flow of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath27 is polynomial the local flow @xmath123 with initial condition @xmath124 is at least real analytic . if @xmath27 is also a keller map , it has a polynomial inverse if the power series expansions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 have infinite radius of convergence for even a single point @xmath125 , in which case the flow is actually polynomial for any @xmath125 . that follows from the corresponding result for complex keller maps ( * ?",
    "* thm 3.2 ) , by treating @xmath27 as a complex polynomial map and @xmath126 as a point of @xmath127 .",
    "eqn ( 4 ) was first circulated by arno van den essen in an email message to a number of colleagues in june 1994 .",
    "i made two blunders and a significant typographical error in describing the associated pinchuk map @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "the errors were corrected in @xcite and belatedly for the official record in @xcite .",
