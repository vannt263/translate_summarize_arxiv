    "<S> a striking angular dependence in the laboratory frame is found within @xmath3-@xmath3 correlation functions for both systems that greatly exceeds the measured and expected isospin dependent difference between the neutron - rich and neutron - deficient systems . </S>",
    "<S> sources measured at backward angles reflect the participant zone of the reaction , while much larger sources observed at forward angles reflect the expanding , fragmenting and evaporating projectile remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the size of the source with increasing momentum is observed at backward angles while a weaker trend in the opposite direction is observed at forward angles . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to the theoretical calculations using the buu transport model . </S>"
