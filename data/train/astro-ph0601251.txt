    "it is now widely believed that the so - called `` long '' gamma - ray bursts ( i.e. , grbs with duration @xmath52s and soft spectra , as opposed to the short and hard bursts , e.g. , @xcite ) are intimately connected to the collapse and the cataclismic destruction of some short - lived and very massive stars .",
    "evidence in this regard include ( i ) the signature of type ic supernova and hypernova in the optical transient emission of grb counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) heavy elements from metal - enriched media typical of supernova remnants observed in the spectrum of several x - ray afterglows @xcite ; ( iii ) the unquestionable starbursting nature of their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( iv ) the location of grbs relative to the center of their hosts , which appears to be consistent with a population of progenitors residing in galaxy disks @xcite .",
    "hence it has often been proposed that long grbs could be used as powerful tracers of the global star - forming activity in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as illustrated by the recent identification of a burst at @xmath9@xmath106.29 ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , grbs are indeed detectable up to very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "they are also very little affected by dust extinction , which is known to be particularly significant in distant starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , this picture relies on the strong assumption that the production of grbs in a given starburst region scales only with the rate of stars formed in this environment , with no dependency on other physical parameters that may vary from one galaxy to another or that may evolve throughout the lifetime of the universe .",
    "this assumption is rather major , as the occurrence of a grb could strongly depend on the properties of the gas from which its progenitor originates ( e.g. , metallicity : @xcite ) .",
    "it could also vary according to the fraction of those progenitors involved in binary systems @xcite , and it finally relies on a non - evolution of the initial mass function with redshift . testing this `` one - to - one '' connection between grbs and star formation is therefore particularly crucial to guarantee an accurate understanding of the use of grbs as quantitative tracers of galaxy evolution .    one possible approach to investigate this relation is to compare the properties of the hosts of gamma - ray bursts with respect to the galaxies responsible for the bulk of the star - forming activity in the universe as a function of redshift .",
    "it is now well established that a significant fraction of the present - day stellar mass budget was formed during brief and violent infrared - luminous ( l@xmath11=l@xmath12@xmath510@xmath13l@xmath6 ) episodes of star formation within massive ( @xmath14@xmath55@xmath1510@xmath16m@xmath6 ) galaxies at 0.5@xmath17@xmath9@xmath173 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "investigating the extinction - corrected star formation rate and the mass of grb hosts should therefore provide tight constraints on the relevance of grbs for probing the star formation history of the universe .",
    "previous observational studies on grb hosts though have led to conflicting views about their nature .",
    "based on their properties at optical and near - infrared wavelengths it has been argued that grb hosts are mostly blue , sub - luminous and low - mass galaxies with young stellar populations , characterized by a modest activity of star formation and potential selection effects due to low metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand it has also been claimed that the morphology of these objects and their average radio / submillimeter properties rather indicate massive and actively star - forming galaxies @xcite . in order to bring tighter constraints on the nature of those sources",
    ", we undertook a survey of grb host galaxies with the _ spitzer _ _ space telescope .",
    "_ in this paper we present mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) images of 16 objects at 4.5@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m , which allows us to constrain the presence of evolved stellar populations and dust - enshrouded star - forming activity in these sources . in sect.2",
    "we describe the _ spitzer _ data used in this study .",
    "sect.3 outlines general results derived from these mid - ir observations , while the grb host properties are detailed on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis in sect.4 .",
    "our findings are discussed in sect.5 , and they are finally summarized in sect.6 . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a @xmath18cdm cosmology with h@xmath19=70  km  s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath20=0.3 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "with the exception of the grb970228 which was detected in a sub - luminous blue dwarf galaxy at @xmath9=0.695 @xcite , our sample of grb host galaxies was built by considering every grb identified before july 10@xmath22 , 1999 and localized on the sky with a sub - arscsec accuracy thanks to the detection of an afterglow at longer wavelengths .",
    "this selection is therefore independent of any _ a priori _ information on the properties of the hosts ( e.g. , redshifts , star - formation rates , luminosities , ... ) .",
    "furthermore it does not take into account at which wavelength the position of the grb was determined , i.e. , whether the afterglow was optically bright or whether it was only seen in the radio and/or the x - rays ( i.e. , `` dark '' burst ) .",
    "this led to a sample of 15 objects , to which we added the host of the burst detected on february 22@xmath23 , 2001 ( i.e. , grb010222 ) .",
    "this host galaxy has been claimed to be associated with a scuba / mambo ultra - luminous infrared object @xcite , making it an obvious and quite interesting target for ir observations .",
    "we note however that our sample is obviously subject to the various observational cuts that may have biased the identification of grbs prior to 2001 .",
    "for instance , most of the bursts considered in this work were detected either with the wcf camera on - board the beppo - sax satellite or with the batse instrument on - board the _ comptom gamma - ray observatory_. as revealed by more recent high energy missions like _ hete-2 _ and _ swift _ , this may have imposed a first sub - selection over the whole population of grbs depending on their intrinsic luminosity and the hardness of their spectrum . furthermore , the subsequent ground - based follow - ups that led to the sub - arcsec localization of these grbs as well as the determination of their redshift from optical spectroscopy were likely slower than those currently operated by the new networks of more dedicated telescopes .",
    "this could in principle favor the detection of x - ray and optical transients relatively brighter than the afterglows accompagnying the typical bursts now accessible with _ swift _",
    "@xcite , thus biasing the selection toward host galaxies with low extinction .",
    "in sect.5.4 we will discuss in more detail the implication of our results taking into account the above mentioned issues .",
    "the observations were performed with the _ spitzer _ _ space telescope _ @xcite as part of the irs guaranteed time observing program @xcite .",
    "the j2000 coordinates and the redshifts of the targeted galaxies are reported in table1 along with the name of the grbs that led to their selection .",
    "we initiated our _ spitzer _ program in 2004 while these gamma - ray bursts all occured before february 2001 .",
    "the contribution of the emission from their fading afterglow was therefore negligible at the time of our observations .",
    "each object was imaged with the `` infrared array camera '' ( irac , @xcite ) at 4.5@xmath0 m and 8.0@xmath0 m as well as with the `` multi - band imager and photometer for _ spitzer _ '' ( mips , @xcite ) at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the irac detectors are characterized by 256@xmath15256 squared pixel arrays with a pixel size of 1.22 leading to a total field of view of 5.2@xmath155.2arcmin@xmath24 .",
    "the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) varies between 1.5 and 2 accross the different irac channels .",
    "the mips detector at 24@xmath0 m uses a 2.45pixel size array of 128@xmath15128 elements also resulting in a field of view of 5.2@xmath155.2arcmin@xmath24 .",
    "the image at this wavelength is characterized by a psf with a fwhm of @xmath16 .",
    "each observation was performed using a sequence of several frames slightly dithered with respect to the position of the grb host .",

    "14 frames of 30s led to a total exposure time of 420s per source .",
    "the data were reduced with standard procedures ( i.e. , dark - current subtraction , cosmic ray removal , non - linearity correction , flat - fielding and mosaiking ) using the pipeline of _ spitzer _ science center .    the absolute pointing accuracy of the _ spitzer _ satellite is better than @xmath11 .",
    "the 1@xmath4 relative astrometric uncertainty is less than @xmath10.3 in the irac and mips data .      with the exception of the grb980425 host galaxy lying at @xmath9=0.0085 @xcite ,",

    "counts were measured over a circled area with a radius of 3pixels ( e.g. , 3.6 ) centered at the position of each target .",
    "these counts were translated into flux densities using the conversion factor prescribed in the _ spitzer observing manual _ and a slight correction was finally applied to account for the extended size of the psf .",
    "sensitivity limits of @xmath13.5@xmath0jy and @xmath120@xmath0jy ( 3@xmath4 ) were estimated at 4.5@xmath0 m and 8.0@xmath0 m respectively , based on the dispersion of the flux measurements obtained over blank sky regions within the same aperture as the one used for the photometry of the objects .",
    "evidence for non - negligible blending was found at 24@xmath0 m , which is mostly due to the larger size of the psf and the higher level of extragalactic confusion in the mips images than in the irac data . to ensure accurate results ,",
    "source extraction and photometry were therefore performed using the psf fitting technique of the daophot software @xcite .",
    "we constructed an empirical point spread function from the brightest point sources found in our 24@xmath0 m data .",
    "this psf was accordingly scaled to provide the best match to the object detected at the position of the grb host , thus leading to a direct estimate of its total flux at 24@xmath0 m . as a sanity check",

    "the prediction of their total ir luminosity based on a single mid - infrared flux measurement can be uncertain by a factor of  @xmath55 for a given object .",
    "to constrain the bolometric luminosity of the grb host galaxies , we first converted the 24@xmath0 m flux density ( or upper limit ) measured for each object with a known spectroscopic redshift to a monochromatic luminosity at the corresponding rest - frame wavelength 24@xmath0m/(1+@xmath9 ) . following the approach presented by @xcite , this estimate",
    "was then translated into a total ir luminosity using the three libraries mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "we should emphasize that in these collections of ir spectra , a given monochromatic luminosity at a given wavelength corresponds to a single `` total ir '' luminosity , thus leading to a unique determination of this quantity for each 24@xmath0 m flux measured in our sample .",

    "however , we consider this possibility unlikely as no typical agn signature has ever been reported from the optical , x - ray and radio properties of these objects .",
    "furthermore , we have implicitly assumed that the mips 24@xmath0 m detections purely originate from star - forming activity in the hosts and we have neglected a possible contribution from a transient emission due to the effect of the grb on its close environment . based on a detailed modeling of the heating effect of grbs and their afterflows on their surrounding region , @xcite have argued that a reprocessed dust mid - ir emission could in principle be easily detected by _ spitzer _",

    "we combined our mid - infrared photometry with other broad - band imaging data retrieved from the literature ( see the caption of fig.7 for references ) .",

    "* ) we estimate that more than half of the global star - forming activity throughout the lifetime of the universe has occured within galaxies characterized by @xmath8@xmath5100@xmath0jy . in this context , the significant fraction of non - detections in our mips data is therefore surprising .",
    "similarly , the downsizing evolution of the cosmic star formation history reveals that the bulk of the star - forming activity has been moving from massive galaxies at high redhifts to low - mass objects in the present - day universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "should the long grbs trace the whole population of distant starbursting sources , we should therefore detect these bursts preferentially toward massive systems easily accessible to irac .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the nature of the grb host galaxies as a whole and the sources dominating the high - redshift star - forming activity has already been noted from a comparison between their colors and luminosities at optical and near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or their star formation rate recovered from cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "for instance grb hosts appear blue and optically sub - luminous compared to the massive dusty starbursts .",
    "very often they also display h@xmath83 in emission @xcite , which reveals star formation episodes characterized by younger populations than those typically observed in the distant luminous - infrared galaxies @xcite . as a result",
    "we conclude that the grb afterglows , as they are currently selected , can not be considered as unbiased probes of the integrated activity of star formation in the high redshift universe .      as we have described in more detail earlier ,",
    "our sample consists mostly of galaxies pinpointed using optical afterglows identified prior to 2001 , when grb follow - ups were not as prompt and efficient as they are currently .",
    "this could bias the selection toward the most luminous transients , and therefore against dust - enshrouded grbs occuring within luminous - infrared galaxies . a relevant case illustrating this hypothesis is given by the dark burst grb970828 and its host galaxy ( see sect.[sec:970828 ] ) .",
    "the accurate coordinates of this grb were determined thanks to the detection of its radio afterglow , and the absence of optical transient emission was interpreted as an evidence for dust extinction in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the detection of this object at 24@xmath0 m clearly supports this interpretation , and it suggests that a sample of grb hosts purely selected with optical afterglows could be biased toward dust - free sources . in this context , the xrt instrument on - board the recently - launched _ swift _",
    "satellite is now routinely localizing x - ray grb afterglows with an accuracy of @xmath15 on the sky . in the near - future",
    ", the comparison between the properties of grb host galaxies selected from optical and x - ray afterglows will provide better insights into this possible bias affecting our current sample .",
    "on the other hand , we have not detected the two other host galaxies selected from radio afterglows with no optical transient ( i.e. , the hosts of grb981226 and grb990506 ) , which shows that not all dark grbs originate from dusty galaxies .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite based on the non - detection of four dark grb hosts with the scuba camera at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "in fact , many of these dark bursts could simply be associated with intrinsically very faint and/or fast - decaying optical afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to this observational bias that could affect our selection , another explanation might be directly related to the physical properties characterizing the local environments where long grbs take place . based on theoretical simulations and the connection between grbs , hypernovae and type ic supernovae , it has been argued that long grbs should more likely occur within binary systems @xcite , whose frequency in star - forming regions may vary with redshift .",
    "furthermore it has been suggested that long gamma - ray bursts would be more efficiently produced  and they would also appear more luminous  if they originate from low metallicity progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "massive stars with metal - poor envelopes keep a high angular momentum in the latest stage of their evolution , and they are also less subject to mass loss . after the final collapse , this would favor the formation of a fast - rotating black hole with accretion of material , that could more easily lead to a bright grb event . in this case",
    "grbs would be preferentially observed in young and chemically - unevolved galaxies , which would explain this lack of massive and dusty starbursts in our _ spitzer _ data .",
    "in fact , direct evidence for low metallicity has already been observed in several grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the global properties of these objects such as their blue colors , their relatively low luminosities , their ly@xmath75 emission and their high _ specific _ star - formation rate @xcite do support a picture where grbs occur in low - mass , young and hence metal - poor starbursts .",
    "this is also corroborated by the cosmological simulations obtained by @xcite who identify the grb hosts as the most efficient star - forming objects ( i.e. , sources with the highest specific star - formation rate ) and not as galaxies with obvious high @xmath44 .",
    "in fact a good illustration of this global property can be given by the complex environment of the host of grb980613 .",
    "this burst did not occur in the region detected by mips and harboring therefore the most intense star - forming activity within the galaxy ( see also @xcite for a similar conclusion based on optical hst data ) .",
    "note that the same interpretation can be derived from the characteristics of the grb980425 host galaxy , since the hypernova sn1998bw did not occur in the most active region as revealed by the very luminous mid - ir point source detected with _",
    "we have presented 4.5@xmath0m/8.0@xmath0m  irac and 24@xmath0m  mips observations of 16 grb host galaxies , and our results can be summarized as follows :    * it is now well - established that long grbs are markers of recent bursts of star formation in galaxies .",
    "however most of the grb hosts in our sample were not detected in the rest - frame near - ir and mid - ir with _",
    ", which argues against a population of sources globally dominated by massive and ir - luminous starbursts ( l@xmath11@xmath55@xmath1510@xmath13l@xmath6 ) .",
    "current ir galaxy evolution models indicate that more than half of the integrated star - forming activity throughout the lifetime of the universe occured within @xmath8@xmath5100@xmath0jy galaxies easily detectable by mips-24@xmath0 m . in this context",
    "our results imply that grbs identified and localized with the current techniques can not be used as unbiased probes of the global star formation in the early universe .",
    "* the detection of the grb970828 host by mips at 24@xmath0 m strongly supports the idea that some of the so - called `` dark bursts '' can be explained by the effect of dust extinction within their host galaxy . even though the hosts of the two other dark grbs in our sample ( grb981226 and grb990506 ) were not detected",
    ", this could indicate that the currently grb - selected sources are biased against dusty starbursts . in the near future",
    "the localization of grb hosts using x - ray afterglows detected with the xrt instrument on - board _ swift _ will provide new insights on this potential bias .",
    "+   * the host of grb010222 that has been claimed to be associated with a scuba / mambo galaxy at @xmath9=1.48 is not detected with irac nor with mips , thus bringing strong doubt on the identification of this host at long wavelengths .",
    "similarly our non - detection of the host of grb970508 at @xmath9=0.84 rules out the proposed association of this object with an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy seen at 90@xmath0 m with isophot , and the non - detection of the host of grb980703 at 24@xmath0 m suggests that the radio emission previously - detected in this object does not originate from massive star formation .",
    "+   * the observations of the host galaxies of grb980425 and grb980613 reveal that these bursts did not occur in the regions harboring the most active star - forming activity within their hosts .",
    "this favors a picture in which the production of grbs does not exactly scale with _",
    "star formation _ but also depends on other parameters that remain to be explored ( e.g. , age and chemical enrichment of the parent progenitor populations , initial mass function , fraction of binary systems , ... ) .",
