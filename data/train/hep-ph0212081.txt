    "a study of heavy flavor production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is one of the most promising ways to access the parton density in the nucleon .",
    "as is well known , the polarized parton distribution function ( pdf ) plays an important role in deep understandings of spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "however , knowledge about the polarized sea  quark and gluon distributions remain still poor , and theoretical and experimental ambiguities are rather large . in particular , flavor structure of the sea ",
    "quark distribution has been actively studied in these years .",
    "there are so far several parametrization models of sea ",
    "quark distributions .",
    "though the simplest case is to assume the flavor su(3)@xmath3 symmetry , a new parametrization including the violation of the su(3)@xmath3 symmetrty has been also proposed @xcite . in order to understand the spin structure of the nucleon ,",
    "we need more information about the polarized sea  quark and gluon distribution functions .    charged current ( cc )",
    "dis is effective to extract the flavor decomposed polarized pdfs , since @xmath4 boson changes the flavor of parton .",
    "since there is no intrinsic heavy flavor component in the nucleon , we can extract information of the parton flavor in the nucleon from the study of heavy flavor production in cc dis . actually , the nutev collaboration reported a measurement of unpolarized @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark distributions by measuring dimuon cross sections in neutrino - dis @xcite .    in this work , to extract information about the polarized pdfs we investigated @xmath0/@xmath1 meson production in cc dis including @xmath7 corrections in neutrino and polarized proton scattering ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the leading order process is due to @xmath10 boson exchange @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , several processes are taken account of @xmath7 next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations , in which gluon radiation processes @xmath12 , virtual corrections to remove singularity coming from soft gluon radiation , and boson  gluon fusion processes @xmath13 are considered .",
    "these processes might be observed in the forthcoming neutrino experiments .",
    "we have numerically calculated the spin - dependent cross section and the spin asymmetry @xmath14 which is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the helicity of the target proton .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section can be written in terms of polarized structure functions @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19 .\\ ] ] the @xmath16 and @xmath17 in front of the 3rd term correspond to when initial beam is anti - neutrino and neutrino , respectively .",
    "kinematical variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 are bjorken scaling variable and inelasticity , respectively , defined according to the standard dis kinematics , and @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the momentum of proton , @xmath27 meson , and photon , respectively .",
    "the polarized structure functions @xmath18 in @xmath28 scattering are obtained by the following convolutions : @xmath29 where @xmath30 means @xmath31 are coefficient functions of quarks and gluons , which can be calculated by using perturbative qcd .",
    "@xmath32 represents the fragmentation function of an outgoing charm quark decaying to @xmath27 meson , and we adopted the parametrization proposed by peterson _ et al .",
    "@xmath33 is related to the polarized structure functions through @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "similar analyses have been done by kretzer _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "in which charged current charm production at nlo in @xmath37 and @xmath38 scattering is discussed @xcite .",
    "in numerical calculations , we used the grv98@xcite and mrst99@xcite parametrizations as the unpolarized pdfs .",
    "as for the polarized pdfs , we adopted the aac00@xcite , bb02@xcite , grsv01@xcite , and lss02@xcite parametrizations which are now widely used .",
    "we show the spin asymmetry @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig ] as a function of @xmath20 at initial neutrino beam energy @xmath39 gev . left panel and right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig ] represent asymmetries for @xmath0 production and @xmath1 production , respectively . for @xmath0 production , @xmath5",
    ", @xmath40 quarks and gluon distribution contribute to the asymmetry @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath14 is dominated by valence @xmath41 quark at large @xmath20 ( @xmath42 ) , though the @xmath40 quark component is quite highly suppressed by ckm . on the contrary , for @xmath1 production , @xmath6",
    ", @xmath43 quarks and gluon component contribute to the asymmetry @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath43 quark contribution is almost negligible .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry is directly affected by the shape of the @xmath6 quark distribution . as shown in both figures , spin",
    "asymmetries strongly depend on parametrization models .",
    "we see that the case of the lss parametrization is quite different from the ones of other parametrizations . in particular",
    ", the asymmetry by the lss parametrization in @xmath1 production goes over 1 at @xmath44 , though the asymmetry should be less than 1 .",
    "this is because the polarized @xmath5 quark distribution in their parametrization extremely violates the positivity condition at @xmath44 .",
    "measurement of @xmath1 production in this reaction is effective to test the parametrization models of the polarized pdfs . in semi - inclusive dis",
    ", we have an additional ambiguity coming from the fragmentation function .",
    "however , the ambiguity can be neglected in the @xmath20 distribution of @xmath14 , since the kinematical variable related to fragmentation is integrated out in this distribution .",
    "in summary , semi - inclusive @xmath0/@xmath1 meson production in cc dis in neutrino  polarized proton scattering is discussed .",
    "the cross sections and the spin asymmetries are calculated including @xmath7 corrections with various parametrization models of polarized pdfs . the @xmath1 production is promising to examine the sea  quark density .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath0 production because of the large @xmath41 contribution over the sea  quark contribution .",
    "if the gluon polarization @xmath45 is fixed by rhic experiments with high accuracy , we can directly extract the strange sea @xmath46 .",
