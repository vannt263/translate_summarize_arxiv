    "hadron production in electron - positron annihilations just above @xmath11 threshold has been a subject of mystery and little intensive study for more than three decades since the discovery of charm .",
    "recent developments , like the observation of the @xmath10 reported by the babar collaboration @xcite and subsequently confirmed by cleo - c @xcite and belle @xcite , underscore our incomplete understanding and demonstrate the potential for discovery of new states , such as hybrids and glueballs .",
    "it is also clear that precise measurements of charm - meson properties will shed light on higher - energy investigations of @xmath12-flavored particles and new states that might decay into @xmath12 .",
    "charm decays also offer unique opportunities to test the validity and guide the development of theoretical tools , like lattice qcd , that are needed to interpret measurements of the ckm quark - mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "any comprehensive program of precise charm - decay measurements demands a detailed understanding of charm production .",
    "past studies of hadron production in the charm - threshold region have been largely measurements of the cross - section ratio @xmath13 over this energy range that have been made by many experiments @xcite .",
    "recent measurements with the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) @xcite near charm threshold are especially noteworthy .",
    "there is a rich structure in this energy region , reflecting the production of @xmath14 resonances and the crossing of thresholds for specific charm - meson final states .",
    "interesting features in the hadronic cross section between 3.9 and 4.2  gev include a large enhancement at the threshold for @xmath15 production ( @xmath16  gev ) and a fairly large plateau that begins at @xmath17 threshold ( @xmath18  gev ) .",
    "while there is considerable theoretical interest @xcite , there has been little experimental information about the composition of these enhancements .    in this paper",
    "we describe measurements of charm - meson production in @xmath19 annihilations at thirteen center - of - mass energies between 3970 and 4260  mev .",
    "these studies were carried out with the cleo - c detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) @xcite in 2005 - 6 .",
    "( throughtout this paper use of any particular mode implies use of the charge - conjugate mode as well . )",
    "the principal objective of the cleo - c energy scan was to determine the optimal running point for studies of @xmath20-meson decays .",
    "the same data sample has been used to confirm the direct production of @xmath10 in @xmath19 annihilations and to demonstrate @xmath10 decays to final states in addition to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "specific results presented in this paper include cross - section measurements for exclusive final states with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and inclusive measurements of the total charm - production cross section and @xmath22 .",
    "the data sample for this analysis was collected with the cleo - c detector .",
    "both the fast - feedback analysis carried out as data were collected and the detailed analysis reported here are extensions of techniques developed for charm - meson studies at the @xmath23 @xcite .    an initial energy scan , conducted during august - october , 2005 , consisted of twelve energy points between 3970 and 4260  mev , with a total integrated luminosity of 60.0  pb@xmath24 .",
    "the scan was designed to provide cross - section measurements at each energy for all accessible final states consisting of a pair of charm mesons . at the highest energy point",
    "these include @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where the first three include both charged and neutral mesons .",
    "a follow - up run beginning early in 2006 provided a larger sample of 178.9 pb@xmath24 at 4170  mev , not one of the original scan points , that proved essential in understanding the composition of charm production throughout this energy region .",
    "the center - of - mass energies and integrated luminosities for the thirteen subsamples are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    ".center - of - mass energies and integrated luminosity totals for all data samples used in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these limits .",
    "the lack of obvious enhancement in any open - charm channel relative to other energies , which is in stark contrast to the clear enhancement in @xmath25 , tends to disfavor the hybrid charmonium and tetraquark proposals .",
    "more definitive statements will require additional data from future experiments .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the effort of the cesr staff in providing us with excellent luminosity and running conditions .",
    "we thank e.  eichten and m.  voloshin for useful discussions .",
