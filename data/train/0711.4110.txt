    "the substructures in the surface brightness and temperature are observed both on large scales and in the cluster cores indicating that the gas is not at rest . at the same time",
    "strong shocks are rarely observed ( see markevitch & vikhlinin , 2007 for a review ) suggesting that the cluster gas motions are predominantly subsonic .",
    "the shape of the emission lines as a source of information on the icm velocity distribution has been discussed in detail in sunyaev , norman & bryan ( 2003 ) and inogamov & sunyaev ( 2003 ) .",
    "these papers mostly consider the gas motions induced by cluster mergers . in the present paper we focus on the linewidth as a diagnostic of gas motions in the cores of the galaxy clusters .    in the cores of most clusters and many groups ( e.g. stewart et al 1984 , nulsen et al 1984 , edge & stewart 1991 , mulchaey et al 1993 , fabian 1994 ) ,",
    "the radiative cooling time of the gas is short compared to the age of the cluster and an external source of energy is needed to avoid catastrophic cooling ( e.g. david et al .",

    "the dissipation of turbulent gas motions is one of the highly plausible sources of the required energy ( e.g. pedlar et al .",
    "1990 , churazov et al .",
    "2002 , fabian et al . 2003a , chandran 2005 ) .",
    "these motions can have distinctive effects on the properties of the x - ray lines ( e.g. brggen , hoeft & ruszkowski 2005 ) .",
    "there are several indirect ways of probing the gas velocities , i ) using the resonant scattering of the brightest emission lines ( e.g. gilfanov , sunyaev & churazov , 1987 , churazov et al . , 2004 ) ; ii ) considering the spreading of metals ejected by a central galaxy through the icm ( rebusco et al .",
    ", 2005,2006 , graham et al . , 2006 , roediger et al . , 2007 ) ;",
    "iii ) using h@xmath2 emitting filaments as tracers of the gas motions ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    ", 2003b , hatch et al . ,",
    "in particular in rebusco et al . ( 2005,2006 ) the characteristic spatial and velocity scales of the turbulent eddies were estimated assuming that the dissipation of turbulent motions can generate enough heat to prevent the gas from extreme cooling and that the same motions provide moderate mixing of metals through the icm . using these constraints we calculated the expected width of the brightest x - ray lines for the brightest clusters ( e.g. , a426 - perseus ) .    a micro - calorimeter with energy resolution of less than @xmath3 ev and effective area of @xmath4 @xmath5 has been built for the suzaku mission ( kelley et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the effective areas of the upcoming calorimeters may reach thousands and even tens of thousands of square cm in the next 10 - 15 years and will have a spatial resolution between a few arcseconds and a few arcminutes ( see e.g. ` http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/future/next ` , ` http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=xeus ` , ` http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ` ) .",

    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ sec : turb ] we describe the line broadening under different assumptions for the character of the gas motions ; in section 3 we consider the specific case of the perseus cluster as an example and we investigate the capabilities of sxc in this context .",
    "our findings are discussed and summarized in sections 4 and 5 .    throughout the paper when we mention turbulence , we mean all types of macroscopic gas motions .",
    "there are several bright emission lines in the x - ray range , that are characteristic of the icm in galaxy clusters ( table [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "the he - like iron line at 6.7 kev is the most prominent feature above a few kev : it is especially bright in high temperature ( @xmath11 kev ) clusters . for the lower temperature clusters , and in particular for the cooling flow regions , l lines of iron at @xmath01 kev , lines of si ,",
    "mg and o can be substantially brighter than the 6.7 kev line . in table",
    "[ tab : lines ] we list a sub - sample ( incomplete ) of these lines and provide an estimate of their fluxes from the central @xmath12 ( radius ) region of the perseus cluster .",
    "all line parameters were taken from the atomdb data base ( smith et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is obvious from equation [ eq : sigmas ] that the heaviest elements are the best probes of gas motions , since more massive nuclei have smaller thermal line broadening and , therefore , the turbulent broadening can dominate the thermal broadening . indeed the ratio of the e.g. iron thermal velocity to the proton thermal velocity is small ( @xmath13 ) . thus even for small velocities the turbulent broadening will exceed the thermal broadening ( table [ tab : fwhm ] , figure @xmath14 ) .",
    "for an instrument with a given spectral resolution the energy of the line also plays an important role , since the width of the line simply scales with the line energy .",
    "this makes the iron 6.7 kev line the best probe of the turbulent icm , as long as the instrument has a substantial effective area at 6 - 7 kev .",
    "the above assumption of a gaussian line shape due to turbulent motions is of course only an approximation ( see inogamov & sunyaev 2003 for a discussion ) .",
    "however it is fully sufficient to assess the detectability of the turbulent broadening . in fully developed turbulence",
    "an entire range of scales is produced through an energy cascade ( e.g. richardson 1922 , tennekes & lumley 1972 , lesieur 1997 , mathieu 2000 , davidson 2004 ) , which is characterized by large scale energy - containing motions and a small dissipation scale . in our simplified treatment",
    "we assume that the @xmath15 entering all our equations can be obtained from the kinetic energy of the turbulent motions : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gas density . since the integration of equation [ eq : int ] may result in a line shape different from a pure gaussian we use below an `` effective '' full width half maximum ( efwhm ) , which is defined as the interval of energies centered at the line energy and containing @xmath18 of the line flux .",
    "there is indirect evidence that the gas in cluster centers is involved in some sort of motion .",
    "h@xmath2 emitting filaments , that are thought to be drawn behind buoyant gas bubbles , have been used to trace the icm velocity field ( e.g. hatch et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , salom et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however neither the characteristic velocity scales nor the characteristic patterns of the hot gas motions have been measured in a more direct way so far .",
    "one can identify two major sources of turbulent gas motions in the cores : cluster mergers and the action of a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "each process may produce a velocity field different in intensity and directionality .",
    "let us consider the extreme cases of isotropic , pure radial and pure tangential velocity fields as illustrated in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "if one fixes the total kinetic energy in the motions , then the line of sight component of the velocity can be written as : @xmath19 the first case ( isotropic gas motions ) can occur for a wide variety of driving mechanisms , ranging from mergers to the motions caused by rising buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma or to convection driven by a mixture of thermal plasma and cosmic rays ( chandran 2005 ) .",
    "pure radial gas motions would naturally appear if energy generated by a central agn goes into weak shocks and sound waves ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2003 , forman et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , fabian et al . 2006 ) which propagate through the icm almost radially from the central source .",
    "the case of pure tangential motions seems to be less natural and it is included mostly for completeness .",
    "we note however that in the stratified atmosphere of clusters the characteristic frequencies of the turbulent motions can be smaller than the brunt - visl frequency : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gravitational acceleration due to the dark matter potential , @xmath17 is the gas density , @xmath22 is its pressure and @xmath23 is the adiabatic index . in figure",
    "[ fig : bv ] we plot the brunt - visl frequency , evaluated for the perseus cluster , and compare it with the characteristic frequency of turbulent motions @xmath24 for @xmath25 km s@xmath26 and @xmath27 kpc . in the range where the turbulent frequency is smaller than the local brunt - visl frequency , the gas motions may excite gravity waves ( e.g. churazov et al .",
    ", 2001 , 2002 , omma et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "these waves can propagate and transport energy from a localized patch of turbulent icm within this region ( e.g. in the case of perseus within a radius of @xmath28 arcmin ) .",
    "such a process is well known in atmospheric science and oceanography and it may lead to the formation of non - propagating pancake - shaped vortices ( e.g. riley & lelong 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , one can imagine that patches of predominantly 2-dimensional ( tangential ) vortices can be created with this mechanism .",
    "we now calculate ( figure [ fig : beta ] ) the expected width of the iron 6.7 kev line for each of the three limiting cases given in equation [ eq : vel ] , for a model cluster with the density parameterized by a simple @xmath29 model : @xmath30^{-3/2 \\beta}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the core radius of the cluster and @xmath32 . the gas temperature and the abundance of iron",
    "are assumed to be constant .",
    "the velocity @xmath15 is fixed to 300 @xmath33 .",
    "the thermal broadening ( first term in equation [ eq : sigma ] ) is omitted in the calculation of the linewidth , but the level of thermal broadening for a 6 kev plasma is shown for comparison ( dashed line ) .",
    "the three plots in figure [ fig : beta ] correspond to @xmath32 from left to right , respectively .",
    "as expected from equation [ eq : vel ] , isotropic turbulence produces a linewidth independent of the projected distance from the cluster center .",
    "pure radial gas motions would result in a line whose width is peaked towards the center of the cluster , while pure tangential motions produce the broadest line outside the cluster core . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the curve approaches asymptotic values ( different for each velocity pattern ) , that are functions of @xmath29 only . for large @xmath29",
    "the cluster is more `` compact '' and the gradients of the width of the line with radius become stronger , while for low @xmath29 the change of the linewidth is more gradual .",
    "it is quite plausible that the characteristic turbulent velocity scale varies with the distance from the cluster center .",
    "if gas motions are driven by the outflows of a central agn , then their amplitude will likely decrease for large radii , since the energy would be spread over larger masses of gas and it would be partly dissipated at smaller radii .",
    "for example , the characteristic amplitude of spherical sound waves propagating through a declining density profile decreases as @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 the velocity varies as @xmath37 . if , furthermore , dissipation is taking place then the amplitude will decline more quickly , as suggested by fabian et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and studied in three - dimensional viscous simulations by ruszkowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for rising buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma the terminal velocity scales as @xmath38 ( e.g. churazov et al . ,",
    "2001 ) , where @xmath39 is the keplerian velocity at radius @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the characteristic size of the bubble .",
    "the adiabatic expansion of the bubble leads to a slow change of the bubble size @xmath42 ( assuming that the adiabatic index of the medium inside the bubble is 4/3 ) .",
    "thus the characteristic bubble velocity is @xmath43 - a decreasing function of the radius for plausible @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if the bubble breaks down into smaller bubbles , then the terminal velocity will decrease even further with the radius .",
    "alternatively , if the turbulence is driven by shocks originating from minor mergers , then it is possible that the velocity amplitude will instead decline towards the center , where the gas density and the thermal gas pressure are the highest . for example , for a plane sound wave propagating into a region of increasing density the characteristic velocity is @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 if @xmath48 .",
    "here we have ignored both the possible reflection of the sound waves by a steep density gradient ( important for long wavelength perturbation ) and the focusing of sound waves due to decreasing sound speed towards the center ( pringle , 1989 ) . in reality",
    "the effect of mergers on the cluster core is much more complicated and the above estimate can at best be considered as indicative .    for illustration we model two possibilities ( decreasing or increasing turbulence ) by considering @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 km / s .",
    "we further assume that when @xmath52 km / s , the velocity saturates at @xmath53 km / s .",
    "the resulting linewidth profiles are shown in figure [ fig : raising ] .",
    "clearly the radial dependence of the velocity amplitude can strongly affect the behavior of the linewidth as a function of projected distance .",
    "we now calculate the expected width of the 6.7 kev line by using the perseus cluster as an example .",
    "perseus ( a 426 ) is the brightest nearby x - ray cluster and it is one of the best - studied cool core clusters , together with m87 and centaurus .",
    "it hosts in its core a luminous elliptical galaxy ngc 1275 , containing a bright radio source ( 3c 84 ) . in the core region",
    "a complex substructure is seen in x - ray temperature , x - ray surface brightness and optical light distributions .",
    "such substructure includes holes in the x - ray images due to bubbles of relativistic plasma ( bhringer et al .",
    ", 1993 , fabian et al . 2000 ) , quasi - spherical ripples ( fabian et al . 2003a ) and optical h@xmath2 filaments ( fabian et al .",
    "2003b , hatch et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in our estimates of the expected linewidth in perseus",
    ", we assume that the gas cooling losses are compensated by the dissipation of the turbulent motions at all radii .",
    "this is of course a strong and not fully justified assumption , but it provides clear predictions if the turbulent heating is indeed important in cluster cores",
    ". thus one can write : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gas cooling function and @xmath56 is a dimensionless constant of the order of unity ( see e.g. dennis & chandran , 2005 ) , which depends on the character of the turbulent motions . since the electron density and temperature are known from observations ( e.g. churazov et al . , 2003 )",
    "one can estimate @xmath57 from equation [ eq : bal ] . as the linewidth depends explicitly on @xmath15 one has to determine ( or assume ) some constraints on @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , rebusco et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) and graham et al .",
    "( 2006 ) considered the turbulent spreading through the icm of metals produced by the brightest cluster galaxy . treating this process in a diffusion approximation",
    "one can estimate the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath59 . in the perseus cluster @xmath60 ( rebusco et al .",
    "one can then cast @xmath59 in the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a dimensionless constant of the order of unity ( see dennis & chandran 2005 for a compilation of values of @xmath56 and @xmath62 ) . combining equation [ eq : bal ] ( at some radius ) and the expression for the diffusion coefficient",
    ", both @xmath15 and @xmath58 can be measured . in perseus",
    "the characteristic values were found to be @xmath63 20 kpc and @xmath64 410 km / s ( rebusco et al .",
    "if we adopt @xmath65410 km / s as the characteristic velocity of turbulent motions at every radius in perseus then , depending on the directionality of the turbulence ( see figure [ fig : pdir ] ) , the expected width of the 6.7 kev line in perseus should be in the range 10 - 20 ev .",
    "of course the above values of @xmath58 and @xmath15 are only order of magnitude estimates . from equation [ eq : bal ]",
    "it is clear that @xmath66 . if @xmath67 then @xmath68 ( when @xmath69 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : heat ] we calculate the linewidth for several illustrative cases : three solid lines with different thickness correspond to @xmath702 , 20 , 200 kpc ( at all radii ) .",
    "this spread of two orders of magnitude in @xmath58 results in a factor of 3 change of the linewidth .",
    "if instead we follow the arguments of dennis & chandran ( 2005 ) and set @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , then @xmath73 const when @xmath69 . the corresponding curve is shown in figure [ fig : heat ] by the dashed line .    in order to make some estimates we consider the proposed sxc with an effective area which can be provided by the current generation of x - ray mirrors with a rather short focal length of less than @xmath74 meters . at @xmath8 kev the effective area is @xmath75 @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt a spectral and spatial resolution of @xmath76 ev and @xmath14 arcmin respectively . the design goal for sxc",
    "is 4 ev resolution , a field of view of @xmath77 arcmin square and pixels of @xmath78 arcmin square .",
    "we want to check how accurately a micro - calorimeter with such parameters will measure the turbulent broadening in the perseus cluster .",
    "the expected number of photon counts in the iron complex in a 1 msec observation is plotted in figure [ fig : flux ] .",
    "note that , although we focus on the line broadening of the @xmath8 kev line , in what follows we use all the photon counts in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev band , in order to obtain better fits ( for reference the number of counts due to the @xmath8 kev line accounts for @xmath79 of the total number of counts in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev band ) .",
    "we simulated the observed spectra using xspec , specifically the _ bapec _ model , which takes into account isotropic broadening . for @xmath80 km / s ,",
    "the component of the velocity along the line of sight is about @xmath81 km / s .",
    "an example of the simulated spectrum ( for a 1 msec long observation ) is shown in figure [ fig : xspec ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured 6.7 kev line broadening as a function of the number of counts is plotted in figure [ fig : fake ] .",
    "the solid line shows the true broadening ( @xmath81 km / s ) , while the long - dashed and dotted lines indicate the level of @xmath14 sigma confidence for the fitted velocity .",
    "the comparison with figure 8 suggests that already within @xmath82 arcmin there are enough photons to measure the turbulent velocity with an uncertainty of @xmath83 km / s .",
    "figure [ fig : fake ] assumes a plasma temperature of @xmath76 kev .",
    "we repeated the simulations also for higher temperatures and assuming a 2-temperature plasma . in both cases ,",
    "the turbulent velocity can be recovered with an uncertainty below @xmath84 km / s . in order to test the capabilities of our fiducial micro - calorimeter",
    ", we also calculated the accuracy of the fits within each single square of @xmath85 arcmin .",
    "even in the outer parts , the resolution is high enough to measure the turbulent velocity with @xmath14 sigma confidence below @xmath3 km / s .",
    "therefore the spatial dependence of the turbulent velocity could be directly measured and this would give clear indications about the origin of the turbulent gas motions ( see section @xmath74 ) .",
    "all the results obtained in the previous sections are based on the assumption that the characteristic size of the turbulent eddies @xmath58 is much smaller than the characteristic length of the line of sight .    in practice",
    "there are at least two complementary ways of deriving information on the turbulent gas motions with micro - calorimeters .",
    "one can use i ) the variations of the line centroid with position and/or ii ) the width / shape of the line . assuming that the resolution of the instrument is substantially better than the width of the observed line ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] ) the accuracy of determination of the line characteristics ( in the case of a strong single line with negligible continuum , which corresponds to the most optimistic scenario ) is : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the width of the line , @xmath88 is the number of counts in the line , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the 1@xmath91 errors in the centroid and width of the line .",
    "+ the centroid variation method works best only if the characteristic size of the eddies is not too small .",
    "indeed , in practice one observes the spectrum coming from a selected region of the cluster with characteristic sizes @xmath92 ( in projection ) and @xmath93 ( along the line of sight ) .",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath95 then @xmath96 independent eddies are seen by the instrument at the same time . assuming that each eddy produces a centroid shift of the order of @xmath97 , then the observed centroid shift will be @xmath98 .",
    "increasing @xmath92 would increase the number of line photons the instrument detects during observations , but this would simultaneously decrease the amplitude of the centroid shift .",
    "obviously these two effects cancel each other and increasing @xmath92 beyond the characteristic eddy size @xmath58 does not improve the detectability of the centroid variations . making @xmath92 smaller than @xmath58 would just make the number of line photons smaller : the amplitude of the centroid variation should not vary much .",
    "of course studying the centroid variations on spatial scales larger and smaller than @xmath58 will be a very useful test of the distribution of characteristic eddy sizes , but for the principal detection of the gas turbulent motions , the choice of @xmath99 is obviously the optimal one .",
    "thus the question of prime importance is whether the instrument has an effective area large enough to collect photons from a region with size @xmath100 ( e.g. sufficient to detect the centroid variations ) . of course",
    ", averaging along the line of sight remains an unavoidable effect independent of the choice of the region size . in figure",
    "[ fig : el ] we plot the effective length @xmath93 of the region along the line of sight which provides 75% of the total surface brightness in the 6.7 kev line , at a given projected distance from the center of the perseus cluster .",
    "it is clear from this figure that , in the core of the perseus cluster , @xmath93 is of the order of 130 kpc and it increases linearly outside the core .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the curve at 20 - 30 kpc from the center is caused by the complicated iron abundance profile ( see e.g. schmidt et al .",
    "2002 , churazov et al .",
    "thus , for the optimal size of the observed region , the typical amplitude of the centroid variations will be @xmath101 . for estimating the centroid variations , we adopt @xmath64 400 km / s ( i.e. in the isotropic case @xmath102 237 km / s ) and @xmath63 20 kpc ( rebusco et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "in the perseus cluster a single @xmath103 sxc pixel , corresponds to a @xmath104 kpc region pixel , and an effective length along the line of sight of @xmath105 kpc ( see fig.[fig : el ] ) .",
    "thus one can expect @xmath106 eddies ( assuming a @xmath107 volume per eddy ) and the typical centroid variations on these spatial scales are of the order of 50 km / s .",
    "such a shift in velocity corresponds to a @xmath108 1.1 ev shift in the line energy from pixel to pixel for the 6.7 kev line . from eq .",
    "8 it follows that such variations should be detectable with @xmath109 significance in sxc pixels with @xmath105 counts ( for the 6.7 kev line with fwhm of 13 ev - as in fig .",
    "6 ) . as one",
    "can see in fig .",
    "8 the number of photons in the central pixel for a 1 msec observation of the perseus cluster is much higher ( of the order of @xmath110 ) : hence the centroid variation can be measured with great accuracy .",
    "+ the detection of the line broadening has no limitation from the point of view of the region size and the whole cooling flow region can be probed at once . according to eq .",
    "9 the 1@xmath91 error on the width of the line is @xmath111 ev ( for the 6.7 kev line with fwhm of 13 ev and number of detected photons @xmath112 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a change in the characteristic velocity scale of @xmath113 km / s . in a 1 msec observation such broadening",
    "can be measured in each of the @xmath103 pixels of sxc up to a distance of @xmath114 arcminutes from the cluster center ( note that sxc s field of view is @xmath115 arcmin ) .    from fig .",
    "10 and from eq .",
    "9 it follows that during a single 1 msec observation of the perseus cluster with sxc , the turbulent broadening at the level of a few hundred km / s can be measured in a central @xmath103 pixel and a map of the linewidth with the accuracy of the order of @xmath3 km / s covering the area @xmath116 can be obtained .",
    "given the expected dependencies of the line broadening shown in fig.6 and 7 , such a dataset would allow one to firmly establish the level of microturbulence in the perseus cluster and test the hypothesis that turbulent dissipation acts as a mechanism for heating the icm .",
    "the dissipation of turbulent gas motions driven by agn activity is a plausible source of heat for the cooling gas in cluster cores . in this case , we show that the expected width of the iron 6.7 kev line is well above the thermal broadening for most plausible values of the turbulent velocity . in our fiducial model of the perseus cluster , the 6.7 kev linewidth is larger than 10 ev .",
    "hence the proposed sxc micro - calorimeter is well suited for firmly establishing the level of microturbulence in the brightest galaxy clusters .",
    "+ as discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 the linewidth is sensitive to both the radial dependence of the velocity amplitude and the `` directionality '' of the stochastic motions .",
    "this may complicate an unambiguous determination of the properties of the gas motions .",
    "however this degeneracy can be removed if the width of several lines , characteristic for different gas temperatures , can be measured .",
    "assume for example that in addition to the 6.7 kev iron line , the width of the iron l - shell line is detected .",
    "this line is bright at lower temperatures , that are present only in the central region ( cool core ) .",
    "therefore the combined measurement of the width of two or more lines should be sufficient to discriminate among the simplest models with different `` directionalities '' .",

    "<S> the dissipation of turbulent gas motions is one of the likely mechanisms that has been proposed to heat the intracluster medium ( icm ) in the cores of clusters and groups of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the impact of gas motions on the width of the most prominent x - ray emission lines . for heavy elements ( like iron ) </S>",
    "<S> the expected linewidth is much larger than the width due to pure thermal broadening and the contribution due to turbulent gas motions should be easily detected with the new generation of x - ray micro - calorimeters , such as the spektr - rg calorimeter ( sxc ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance in the perseus cluster the turbulent velocity required to balance radiative cooling ( as derived by rebusco et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2006 ) , would imply a width of the 6.7 kev fe line of 10 - 20 ev , while the pure thermal broadening is @xmath04 ev . the radial dependence of the linewidth is sensitive to i ) the radial dependence of the velocity amplitude and ii ) the `` directionality '' of the stochastic motions ( e.g. isotropic turbulence or predominantly radial gas motions ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the width of several lines , characteristic for different gas temperatures , can be measured , then it should be possible to probe both the `` directionality '' and the amplitude of the gas motions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover a measurement of the width would put a lower limit on the amount of the kinetic energy available for dissipation , giving a constraint on the icm models .    </S>",
