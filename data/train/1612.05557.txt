    "buckingham s grain - shearing ( gs ) model@xcite@xmath0@xcite of wave propagation in fluid - saturated , unconsolidated marine sediments is investigated in this article .",
    "the development of the model can be traced back to the earlier works of buckingham.@xcite@xmath0@xcite in comparison to the classical biot theory , the gs model assumes the absence of an elastic frame and shows the generation of both compressional and shear waves from intergranular sliding .",
    "the central idea of the model is that random stick - slip motion drives the intergranular shearing mechanism .",
    "further , the shearing is mediated by a pore - fluid present in between the grains .",
    "the pore - fluid is characterized by a time - dependent viscosity @xmath1 which is expressed as ( see eq .  (",
    "17 ) in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the time , and the zero - order term @xmath4 is the viscosity of the pore - fluid before the sliding is triggered . since , the apparent viscosity of the pore - fluid increases with the duration of shearing , it makes the inter - granular shearing difficult to sustain .",
    "therefore , buckingham refers to this mechanism as `` strain hardening '' , and the first - order term @xmath5 as strain - hardening coefficient .",
    "although the term `` strain hardening '' or `` work hardening '' has sometimes been used in a similar context,@xcite@xmath0@xcite we prefer to reserve it to the field of material science where it is commonly used to explain the increase in hardness of materials in the form of yield strength when stretched beyond the linear elastic region , i.e. , the non - hookean behavior.@xcite    the time - dependent increase of viscosity of the pore - fluid expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) is essentially a shear - thickening property and termed as rheopecty ( or , rheopexy ) in the field of non - newtonian rheology.@xcite@xmath0@xcite a simple example of the rheopectic property can be observed in whipped cream ; the longer one whips , the thicker it gets .",
    "other examples are suspensions containing a mixture of clay , calcium carbonate , starch , and water@xcite and pharmaceutical products.@xcite compared to the rheopectic behavior its opposite time - dependent shear - thinning property called thixotropy is quite common .",
    "some examples of thixotropic fluids are paint , honey , coal - water slurries , cement paste , and waxy crude oil .",
    "the apparent increase and decrease in viscosity is often due to the building - up and breaking down of internal structures which depend on the kinematic shearing history or `` memory '' of the fluid.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the rheopectic and thixotropic properties must not be confused with the time - independent dilatant and pseudoplastic behavior which are yet another category of non - newtonian fluids and depend on shear rate ( or shear stress).@xcite@xmath0@xcite in light of these arguments , we will refer to @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) as the _ rheopectic coefficient _ of the pore - fluid .",
    "in contrast to buckingham s use of a time - varying maxwell model to describe the rheopectic behavior of gs mechanism in marine sediments,@xcite the time - dependent behavior of complex media has often been modeled using fractional viscoelastic models.@xcite@xmath6@xcite the key element in the fractional models is a fractional dashpot , the constitutive stress - strain relation of which is given as,@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the stress , @xmath9 is the strain , @xmath10 is the elastic modulus at zero frequency , @xmath11 is the characteristic retardation time constant , and @xmath12 is the order of the fractional derivative .    this paper which is an expanded version of@xcite builds on buckingham s gs model , and connects the physical mechanism of grain - shearing with the mathematical framework of fractional calculus . as we will later show in the paper",
    ", the wave equations obtained from the gs model when analyzed in the fractional framework , appear as the kelvin - voigt fractional derivative wave equation and the diffusion - wave equation .",
    "the motivation behind this study is two - fold .",
    "first , since fractional derivatives are not constrained to integer - orders , they predict power - law attenuation of the wave proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angular frequency of the wave , and the exponent @xmath15 can be any real positive number .",
    "the apparent good fit of the anomalous phase - velocity dispersion curve and power - law attenuation curve predicted from the gs model with the experimental data is also the main characteristic of materials modeled using fractional calculus.@xcite although , the curve - fitting agreement is mostly in the range of @xmath16-@xmath17 khz,@xcite@xmath0@xcite the similarity between the material impulse response function ( mirf ) from the gs model and the relaxation modulus of the fractional dashpot provides enough impetus to study the gs model in light of the fractional calculus .",
    "also , fractional derivatives have lately been applied to model frequency dependent power - law wave attenuation in sediments.@xcite    second , we have recently demonstrated that just as non - hookean materials lead to nonlinear acoustics , time - dependent non - newtonian materials tend to power law behavior.@xcite interestingly , power - law characteristics are common in materials modeled using fractional derivatives , such as biological media@xcite@xmath6@xcite and earth materials.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the time - dependent non - newtonian media have remained little understood despite their importance to industrial applications.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the underlying reason is the complexities in the associated physical processes , and therefore most models put forward for their investigation are often empirical.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    recently , the use of the fractional derivative was shown in the modeling of time - dependent behavior of muddy clay,@xcite however fractional derivative was introduced ad - hoc without providing any satisfying physical justification .",
    "it should be noted that an arbitrary substitution has its drawbacks as sometimes it could lead to physically meaningless results .",
    "this limitation can be traced back to the way fractional order wave equations are derived from ad - hoc phenomenological models comprising combinations of springs and dashpots.@xcite consequently , the parameter @xmath15 which also corresponds to the order of the resulting fractional differential equations is usually estimated by curve - fitting the experimental data with the theoretically predicted curves.@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath6@xcite on the one hand , fractional derivatives impart greater flexibility to the fitting process , yet their applications have remained restricted due to a lack in their physical interpretation.@xcite@xmath0@xcite on the other hand , in our recent publication,@xcite we have interpreted the order in terms of the parameters of the viscoelastic model . through this work ,",
    "we want to contribute to a change in motivation behind the application of fractional derivatives from inductive to deductive .",
    "we have the opinion that although the foundation of this bridging has been laid by buckingham in the form of the derived mirf of power - law form , he may not have realized this connection himself when he formulated the gs model .",
    "apparently it also seems that the use of the term `` strain - hardening '' hid the implications from the gs model to both non - newtonian rheology and fractional calculus .",
    "this is evident from the fact that neither the connection to past work on power - law behavior , nor to fractional derivatives was mentioned .",
    "one of the possible reasons could be that sediment acoustics and non - newtonian rheology havent shared a strong connection before which is also witnessed from the lack of cross - referencing between the two fields .",
    "another possibility is that the fractional community is comparatively smaller in size , and has been active only in the last thirty years or so .",
    "moreover , their focus has mostly been on pure mathematical research paying little attention to its physical applications .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide a short review of buckingham s gs model mainly outlining its underlying physical mechanism . then , in sec .",
    "iii , the framework of fractional calculus is introduced , followed by the derivation of the kelvin - voigt fractional derivative wave equation and the time - fractional diffusion - wave equation .",
    "the compressional and shear wave equations obtained from the gs model in sec .",
    "ii are then mapped into the domain of fractional calculus in sec .",
    "also , the dispersion relations obtained in the fractional framework are shown to be equivalent to their respective counterparts from the gs model . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the implications of this work .",
    "buckinghams@xcite gs model takes into account the non - biot dissipative mechanisms of grain - shearing in saturated , unconsolidated marine sediments . since at the microscopic level ,",
    "the grains come into contact but lack bonding in the conventional sense , the dynamic frame bulk and shear moduli are zero.@xcite as illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", the static overburden pressure develops micro - asperities at the contact surfaces of the sediment grains . as a result of this micro - roughness ,",
    "the participating grains exhibit stick - slip motion when triggered by a velocity gradient set up by the initial wave disturbance .",
    "the intergranular sliding is mediated through the saturating pore - fluid present between the grains .",
    "the pore - fluid is characterized by a time - varying viscosity given by eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) .",
    "consequently , as the grains slide against each other , the generated viscous drag force increases as time progresses , making the intergranular sliding motion difficult to sustain .",
    "this attribute of the drag force manifested as a result of the rheopectic behavior of the pore - fluid is represented by a time - varying viscous dashpot in the maxwell element .",
    "further , compressional and translational shearing occurring along the radials of the circle of contact of the sliding grains finally build up as compressional and shear waves respectively .     and a time - dependent viscous dashpot @xmath1 .",
    "figure adapted from ref .  .",
    "]    buckingham goes back to tribological properties to explain the rheopectic behavior of the pore - fluid where the properties emerge as a result of narrow confinement of the fluid in between the asperities .",
    "while this is a subject of ongoing research,@xcite we have the opinion that instead of anticipating `` regular '' seawater trapped in between the grains , a concentrated colloidal suspension is more likely in a marine - like environment .",
    "we would also like to add that rheopectic properties could occur due to changes in the state of aggregation or coagulation of the suspensions .",
    "such behavior has already been observed in granular and clay - like colloidal suspensions in which the applied shear forces build up the interlinking of the structural elements giving rise to the apparent increase in viscosity.@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite the build - up of the structures is often disrupted upon the removal of shear which makes the process reversible .",
    "the opposite happens in the case of thixotropic fluids .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the apparent change in viscosity can not keep on increasing or decreasing forever .",
    "it must stop once a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached as observed in time - dependent fluid flow .",
    "further , due to its complexity , the time - dependent non - newtonian behavior is quite difficult to understand and so to model .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that contrary to the gs model in which rheopectic properties emerge from the biphasic granular - pore - fluid medium , time - dependency is already inherited in the stick - slip processes occurring in dried granular materials too . in the latter case it manifests itself as a result of the microscopic junctions formed due to",
    "the sliding of micro - asperities against each other.@xcite@xmath0@xcite such situations might arise in partially saturated sediments as well as where the grains could come into direct contact with each other , and still exhibit time - dependent behavior .",
    "further , given the fact that the material is granular and unconsolidated , for a given sample of randomly distributed grains of varying shapes , sizes and orientations , rotation of grains could also occur .",
    "this gives possibilities for squeezing of the pore - fluid in between the grains which could finally emerge as a squirt flow similar to the predictions from the biot ",
    "stoll plus grain - contact squirt and shear flow ( bicsqs ) model.@xcite    although in this article we have focused on the gs model only , it should also be mentioned that the model has undergone two improvements in the last fifteen years .",
    "the first is the viscous grain shearing ( vgs ) model,@xcite which takes into account the effect of pore - fluid viscosity on the gs process .",
    "consequently , an additional relaxation time constant is included which helps in better fitting of the experimental data at low frequencies @xmath18 , but merges asymptotically with the gs model at high frequencies .",
    "second , the recent vgs(@xmath19 ) model@xcite@xmath0@xcite in which the assumption that the effect of pore - fluid viscosity is the same for both the compressional wave and the shear wave is modified , thus yielding two different relaxation time constants .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 represents the wavelength dependence of fluid viscosity in damping of the waves .",
    "buckingham writes the constitutive relation of the modified maxwell model ( see eqs .",
    "( 13)(16 ) in ref .  ) as @xmath20 the stress relaxation for the maxwell element is derived as ( see eqs .  ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath21 the time - dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) along with the introduction of a leading term is identified as the pulse shape function @xmath22 and written as : @xmath23 since the pulse shape function corresponds to a time - varying system , we have added a second temporal argument to it which represents the time of the input relative to the triggering of the time varying viscosity.@xcite assuming that this triggering occurs at @xmath24 , we will skip the second argument from here onwards in all subsequent steps .",
    "since the stick - slip processes are randomly distributed across the medium , they are therefore ensemble averaged to obtain the material impulse response functions ( mirfs ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 for compressional waves and shear waves respectively .",
    "the mirfs are given as ( see eqs .",
    "( 25)(28 ) in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 in the above equations , the subscripts `` p '' and `` s '' symbolize the terms associated with pressure or compressional waves and shear waves respectively .",
    "also , the material exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 from ref",
    ".   are reflected as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively in our calculations .",
    "this is done to avoid a potential conflict with the symbols reserved for the framework of fractional calculus in sec .",
    "further , following the argument that the sliding between micro - asperities is indistinguishable for compressional and shear stress relaxations ( see eqs .  ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) in ref .  )",
    ", we drop the notations of `` p '' and `` s '' from eqs .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) and ( [ eq07 ] ) such that @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 however , it should be noted that the mirfs for the compressional wave and shear wave are not actually same .",
    "this is because the compressional viscoelastic time constant @xmath36 and shear viscoelastic time constant @xmath37 are not equal , but rather @xmath38 .",
    "this correction had modified the vgs model to become the vgs(@xmath19 ) model which gave a better fit to the shear wave dispersion measurements.@xcite@xmath0@xcite however since the goal of this paper is not to curve - fit the experimental data , but rather show the built - in connection between the gs model and the fractional calculus we will stick to the simplified assumptions represented by eqs .",
    "( [ eq08])([eq10 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the exact value of the time constants does not alter the form of the wave equations and dispersion relations and therefore , any required scaling could be implemented through a direct substitution in the final expressions .",
    "buckingham then applies the navier - stokes equation to study the medium macroscopically resulting in the following two wave equations ( see eqs .  ( 52 ) and ( 53 ) in ref .  ):",

    "it must be noted that in the absence of the arbitrary time @xmath64 introduced by buckingham in eqs .",
    "( [ eq14])([eq19 ] ) , the equations become dimensionally inconsistent .",
    "the merit of the gs model lies in the fact that besides predicting the dispersion relations for compressional and shear waves as functions of frequency , it also relates to the geo - acoustic parameters of the material , such as grain size , density , viscosity , porosity , and over - burden pressure.@xcite however , the material exponent , the time constant , and the stress - relaxation coefficients can not be deduced from the microscopic properties , but rather heuristically inferred from field measurements of sound speed and attenuation in sediments.@xcite",
    "fractional calculus though as old as the classical newtonian calculus was rediscovered only lately by caputo in @xmath65 to model the dissipative mechanism in earth materials.@xcite besides offering a mathematical extension to the regular integer order derivatives , fractional derivatives facilitate modeling of materials characterised by spatial and/or temporal memory kernels with arbitrary order exponents .",

    "( [ eq20])([eq22 ] ) it can be seen that the power - law memory kernel is built into the fabric of fractional calculus .",

    "on the one hand , the two disparate fields of sediment acoustics and non - newtonian rheology have traditionally developed nearly independent of each other .",
    "it is partially because the intended goals are different in the two fields .",
    "also , the experimental instruments employed are not usually common to the two fields . on the other hand ,",
    "fractional calculus has developed as a standalone mathematical framework , lacking a proper connection to real physics .",
    "there are mainly two goals achieved in this paper .",

    "we have shown that the equations derived from the fundamental physical process of grain - shearing could also lead to fractional order wave equations .",
    "the connection is further validated from the dispersion results in the fractional framework which are shown to be equivalent to their respective counterparts in the gs model .",
    "a bonus of this bridging is the physical significance of the fractional order which is extracted from the gs model .",
    "an estimation of the order from the physical parameters of the material would now greatly reduce the ambiguities in the curve - fitting of the experimental data . besides , this will also help in identifying the underlying physical processes in materials which exhibit power - law jumps from one form to another , such as , from a damped diffusive process to a propagating wave . with increase in complexity of the material",
    ", there is a demand for a more flexible but yet a robust mathematical framework for their modeling .",
    "fractional calculus is one of the candidates which could meet this demand .",
    "moreover , without adopting a fractional calculus approach , such complex material behavior could be difficult to model , both analytically as well as numerically.@xcite    second , the term `` strain - hardening '' which is central to the gs model has been recognized as the property of rheopecty . such hardening behavior has already been shown to result in the lomnitz logarithmic creep law,@xcite the seismological applications of which can be witnessed in rock physics,@xcite marine sediments@xcite and earthquake modeling.@xcite by establishing the equivalence of wave equations and dispersion relations of the gs model to the respective equations obtained in the fractional framework we have also demonstrated the possibility of modeling time - dependent non - newtonian fluid properties using fractional derivatives .",
    "such fluid properties have remained an open problem from modeling perspectives so far .",
    "besides , the similarity between a fractional dashpot and a time - varying maxwell model would now encourage the use of fractional viscoelastic models in both the fields of sediment acoustics as well as non - newtonian rheology.@xcite the bridging of the two fields is expected to be symbiotic .    another possible advantage from this bridging",
    "is that the dispersion relations in the fractional framework are solely determined by the characteristic retardation time constant @xmath104 , and the fractional order @xmath174 , which although challenging could be measured using the experimental techniques of non - newtonian rheology.@xcite the time - dependent fluid behavior can be measured by a more direct steady shear test as well as by the hysteresis loop test .",
    "this could then possibly free the gs model from the heuristic estimation of curve - fitting parameters .",
