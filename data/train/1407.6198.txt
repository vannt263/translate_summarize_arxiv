    "figure  [ magnetization](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization @xmath92 of srcu@xmath9zn@xmath10(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 at the field of 1  t. the increase of @xmath92 for @xmath11 = 0.0174 and 0.0032 at low temperatures should be ascribed to the impurity - induced unpaired spins . by subtracting the magnetization for @xmath11 = 0 from these data and normalizing by @xmath11",

    "[ magnetization](a ) .",
    "the values of @xmath93 are nearly identical for @xmath11 = 0.0174 and 0.0032 in the whole temperature range , indicating that zn@xmath3 ions effectively replace the cu sites .",
    "the increase of @xmath93 below 10 k is described reasonably well by a free spin model @xmath94 with @xmath95 = 1/2 , where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is the brillouin function . above 10  k ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath93 is much smaller than @xmath98 , indicating that zn impurites can no longer generate free spins because of interaction between unpaired cu spins and thermally excited triplets .",
    "figure  [ magnetization](b ) shows the magnetic field dependence of @xmath92 at 2 k. although the magnetization of a free spin @xmath98 saturates completely above 4  t as indicated by the solid line , @xmath92 of srcu@xmath9zn@xmath10(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 keeps increasing almost linearly with @xmath14 at high fields . the nmr spectra shown in fig .",

    "[ saturation](b ) provides further support for the saturation of spin moments .",
    "thus the linear increase of @xmath92 at high fields can not be attributed to spin moments .",
    "it may be associated with orbital ( van vleck ) magnetism , even though we do not understand the mechanism for such a behavior . by subtracting the @xmath14-linear component at high fields from @xmath92",

    "the data of @xmath92 for @xmath11 = 0 is obtained from ref .  [ 26 ] .",
    "the red open circles and blue open squares indicate the contribution @xmath93 from impurity - induced spins for @xmath11 = 0.0174 and 0.0032 , respectively .",

    "the frequency for the spectrum at 4.5  t is shifted by 28.87  mhz to account for the difference in the nuclear zeeman frequency .",

    "such a process has been indeed confirmed by measurements of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath67 and of the spin - echo decay rate 1/@xmath99 .",
    "a standard inversion recovery method was used for the 1/@xmath67 measurement . to determine 1/@xmath99 , the spin echo intensity @xmath100 as a function of the time @xmath101 between the two rf - pulses was fit to the exponential function @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ dynamics ] shows the temperature dependences of 1/@xmath67 and 1/@xmath99 measured on the low frequency quadrupole satellite line of the b@xmath68 site at 6.615 t. both 1/@xmath67 and 1/@xmath99 exhibit a peak but at different temperatures .",
    "the peak in 1/@xmath67 occurs at 3.8  k while the peak in 1/@xmath99 appears near 2.5  k. in fact , @xmath99 becomes too short near 2.5  k to be able to observe nmr signal . at lower temperatures , both 1/@xmath67 and 1/@xmath99 show steep decrease , consistent with the excitation gap for",
    "impurity induced spins in a magnetic field .",
    "let us first discuss 1/@xmath67 , which is related to the time correlation function of the local field by the standard formula , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the nmr frequency .",
    "a simple expression for the correlation function parametrized by the mean square amplitude of the fluctuation @xmath106 and the correlation time @xmath107 , @xmath108 leads to the following simple result , @xmath109 the saturation of the impurity - induced moments is expected to proceed with the depression of @xmath106 and the growth of @xmath107 .",
    "the peak in 1/@xmath67 can be reproduced only by the latter process .",
    "indeed 1/@xmath67 exhibits a peak when @xmath110  s , a well known result in the context of motional narrowing in classical nmr [ 29 ] .",
    "the slowing down of the spin fluctuation can also cause a peak in 1/@xmath99 , with different criteria however . when the fluctuating local field slows down ,",
    "the fastest spin - echo decay is achieved when @xmath111 becomes comparable to @xmath112 and the peak value of 1/@xmath99 has the same orders of magnitude as @xmath111 at the peak temperature [ 30 , 31 ] .",
    "although we were not able to determine the peak value of 1/@xmath99 due to loss of nmr signal , it should be of the order of @xmath113  s@xmath114 , judging from the data in fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] , indicating that @xmath115  s at 2.5 k , which is much longer than the value estimated at the peak temperature of 1/@xmath67 ( 3.8  k ) .",
    "thus , different peak temperatures of 1/@xmath67 and 1/@xmath99 provide evidence for a rapid but gradual slowing down of the fluctuation of the impurity - induced spins , which precedes the complete saturation at lower temperatures .",
    "figure  [ xdep ] shows the @xmath2b nmr spectra for @xmath11 = 0.0032 and 0.0174 at 1.6 k and 6.615 t. both samples show nearly identical spectra .",
    "all the resolved peaks are exactly at the same frequencies , indicating that the average distance between zn@xmath3 ions is sufficiently large and effects of interaction between impurity - induced spins can be neglected .",
    "however , the widths of the individual lines for @xmath11 = 0.0174 are slightly larger than those for @xmath11 = 0.0032 , which is likely due to the difference in the distribution of the demagnetizing fields inside the crystals .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) have been performed using the standard lanczos algorithm for the @xmath116 heisenberg model on shastry - sutherland lattices ( @xmath117 and 36 sites , see fig .  [ clusters ] ) having a single impurity .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used to minimize finite - size effects .",
    "the presence of an impurity forbids to use any translation symmetry , but we have still made use of the remaining reflection symmetry to reduce the size of the hilbert space .",
    "after computing the ground - state , one can easily extract the average magnetization on each site .",
    "note that since the polaron has a large but finite extension beyond which the magnetization becomes very small , one can expect a priori the finite - size effects to be small .",
    "this is confirmed by a comparison of the results obtained on 32-site and 36-site clusters , for which the magnetizations are nearly identical , a conclusion further confirmed by calculations on larger clusters up to 64 sites with infinite product entangled pair state simulations [ p. corboz , private communication ] .",

    "colored dimers correspond to strong @xmath5 bonds while @xmath118 bonds are not shown for clarity ( except the @xmath119 bonds introduced in the main text ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used to minimize finite - size effects , so that colored dimers crossing the boundaries can be easily identified with different colors . ]",
    "one of our main conclusion that @xmath66 is based on the intensity ratio of the b@xmath68 and b@xmath0 lines , which are assigned to the b sites close to cu@xmath59 and cu@xmath36 on the layer of the zn impurity .",
    "equally important is the intensity ratio of of the b@xmath81 and b@xmath82 lines assigned to the b sites on the adjacent layers coupled to cu@xmath59 and cu@xmath36 with the same dipolar coupling @xmath84 .",
    "the spectrum of the center line of these sites are displayed in fig .",
    "[ intensity](a ) with an enlarged scale .",
    "we can clearly see that the integrated intensity of the b@xmath82 line is twice as large as the b@xmath81 line .",
    "since cu@xmath59 is twice as abundant as cu@xmath36 , the b@xmath82 ( b@xmath81 ) line must be assigned to the neighbor of cu@xmath59 ( cu@xmath36 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath22 is larger for the b@xmath82 line than for the b@xmath81 line then leads to the conclusion that @xmath66 .",
    "the ed calculation shows that there is another pair of lines ( 10 and 10@xmath121 ) assigned to the b sites on the adjacent layers coupled to cu@xmath59 and cu@xmath36 with the smaller dipolar coupling @xmath122 ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "4b of the main text ) .",
    "although the experimentally observed b@xmath120 line shows only a single peak , the spectral shape can be actually fit well to a sum of two lorentzians with the intensity ratio of 2 to 1 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ intensity](b ) .",
    "the fact that one of these lines with larger @xmath22 has the double intensity is again consistent with the conclusion @xmath66 .",
    "there is a puzzle though . since the two pairs of lines",
    "are coupled to the same pair of cu sites ( cu@xmath59 and cu@xmath36 ) with different dipolar couplings , their separation should be equal to the ratio of the dipolar couplings @xmath123 . however , this ratio in the experimental spectrum is much larger ( nearly 3 ) .",
    "this suggests that the internal fields at the b sites in the adjacent layers are not entirely due to the in - plane cu moments and that small contributions from induced moments on cu sites in the adjacent layers due to interlayer exchange may be relevant . to explore such effects",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper however .    for other experimental lines b@xmath124 - b@xmath125 ,",
    "the resolution is not sufficient to achieve a one to one correspondence with the calculated lines .",
    "however , the assignment of lines b@xmath126 and b@xmath127 to the pairs of theoretical lines ( 8 , 8@xmath121 ) and ( 9 , 9@xmath121 ) is plausible since they are well separated from the others .",
    "finally , the lines b@xmath128 and b@xmath129 develop on top of the broad tail of the main line , consistent with the numerous theoretical lines on the negative side of the main line , even though specific assignment is not possible .",

    "3(b ) of the main text suggests that the lattice distortion is confined in the immediate vicinity of zn , the simplest model consists in assuming that only the exchange interaction for the cu - cu bonds closest to the zn impurity , i.e. the exchange between cu@xmath36 and cu@xmath61 , changes from the bulk @xmath6 to @xmath89 ( see fig .  [ clusters ] ) .    we have calculated the moments at cu@xmath36 and cu@xmath59 sites by exact diagonalization using a cluster of 32 or 36 sites as a function of @xmath130 for three values of the bulk ratio @xmath131 , 0.63 , 0.65 , and 0.67 .",

    "<S> thanks to this assignment , we are now in a position to fix @xmath35 and @xmath67 by fitting the experimental value of @xmath22 at the b@xmath68 and b@xmath0 sites using the 36-site cluster results ( interpolated between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . </S>",

    "<S> since other boron sites in the layer of the impurity have much smaller internal fields , we now turn to the neighboring layers . </S>",
    "<S> they have smaller values of @xmath22 coming from the interlayer dipolar couplings @xmath79 or @xmath80 as shown in the upper panel of fig .  [ histogram](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , the agreement with the experimental results is very good . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the experimental lines b@xmath81 and b@xmath82 . since b@xmath82 is twice as intense as b@xmath81 ( see fig .  [ spectrum ] ) , we must assign b@xmath82 to the neighbors of cu@xmath59 in the layer above , and b@xmath81 to the neighbor of the cu@xmath83 in the layer below . since both couplings are given by @xmath84 , the larger @xmath22 at b@xmath82 than b@xmath81 provides an independent confirmation that @xmath66 . with its strongly negative @xmath22 , the line </S>",

    "<S> so far we have assumed that the hyperfine couplings are not influenced by zn - doping . </S>",
    "<S> however , the small difference in the ionic radii between cu@xmath3 and zn@xmath3 ( about 5% @xcite ) could produce non - uniform chemical pressure effects , which may result into a local lattice distortion and a modification of the hyperfine couplings . to estimate such effects , the quadrupole splitting @xmath26 is a useful probe since it is sensitive to changes in local structure and charge density . </S>",
    "<S> the inset ( b ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the values of @xmath26 for all the observed b nmr lines . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , most sites have exactly the same value @xmath26 = 1.25  mhz as in undoped srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 ( solid line ) . only the lines b@xmath81 and b@xmath25 show minor deviations of about 0.02  mhz , indicating that the effects of lattice distortion are small and limited to the immediate vicinity of the zn impurities . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath26 at the boron sites close to cu@xmath36 and cu@xmath59 is unchanged , an indication that the hyperfine couplings are likely to remain the same . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dipolar coupling , which varies slowly with distance as @xmath87 , should not be affected by a small lattice distortion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our conclusion @xmath66 should remain valid even allowing for a local distortion around the impurity .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us compare the values of @xmath35 reported so far from various measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of susceptibility and specific heat data of the undoped material by the shastry - sutherland model with an interlayer coupling has led to the best value @xmath35 = 0.635 @xcite , while the recent determination of the width of the 1/2 plateau in very high magnetic fields up to 118  t @xcite led to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are smaller than our estimate @xmath35 = 0.665 necessary to account for the internal structure of the polaron . after discarding other possibilities such as dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( we checked with ed for the zn doped system that neither the intradimer nor the interdimer dzyaloshinsky - moriya coupling was able to account for the discrepancy ) , we came to the conclusion that the most likely explanation is that the ratio @xmath35 increases near zn due to the local chemical pressure induced by the larger ionic radius of zn@xmath3 as compared to cu@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a similar effect has already been observed in undoped samples under hydrostatic pressure @xcite . to actually demonstrate that this local modification could explain the discrepancy , we have examined a simple model in which the cu - cu bond closest to zn . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. the cu@xmath36-cu@xmath61 bond @xmath89 is allowed to change from the bulk @xmath6 ( see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> mat . </S>",
    "<S> f @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the polaronic structure derived from nmr is actually compatible with @xmath90 if @xmath89 is allowed to take larger values in the range @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath35 is already significantly lower than the estimate 0.665 for the uniform system , and it sounds plausible that this value can be further lowered if one allows for additional modifications of the coupling constants </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to investigate this possibility further with the help of ab - initio investigations of the local exchange couplings of zn doped . </S>",
    "<S> this however goes far beyond the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
