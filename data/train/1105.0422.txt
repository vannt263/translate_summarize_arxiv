    "within the last 13 years a connection between two of the most energetic phenomena in our universe , long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs , @xmath3  s ; @xcite ) and core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , has been established .",
    "the first sn associated with a grb was reported by @xcite , who found the extremely luminous sn  1998bw to be associated with grb  980425 .",
    "subsequently , several other grb  sne were found , and a few of these have also been spectroscopically confirmed , most prominently grb  030329 @xcite , grb  031203 @xcite , grb  060218 , and grb  100316d @xcite .",
    "all these sne are broad - lined type ic ; they lack lines from hydrogen and helium in their spectra and have broader lines than typical core - collapse sne .",
    "most of these spectroscopic sn - associated grbs are low - luminosity grbs for which the emitted energies in the @xmath4-ray band are in the range @xmath5 erg , which is 24 orders of magnitude smaller than for typical grbs detected at larger distances .",
    "they also had comparably fainter or undetected optical and x - ray afterglows , and did not always obey the @xmath6@xmath7 correlation .",
    "the only well - known exception is grb  030329 at @xmath8 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to test whether the sn - grb connection holds in general for high - redshift , high - luminosity grbs . to date ,",
    "evidence in this direction is provided by the photometric detection of sn - like bumps in the late - time light curves of several grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopy was also obtained in a few cases , although the contamination from the host galaxy and the faintness of the targets makes it difficult to reach firm conclusions in some of these cases .",
    "grb  101219b was detected by the _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2010 december 19 at 16:27:53 ut . its afterglow was promptly detected by _",
    "swift _ both in the x - ray and uv / optical bands @xcite .",
    "the grb was observed to have a duration of @xmath9 s in the 15150 kev band @xcite .",
    "it was also observed by _",
    "fermi_/gbm , where a duration of @xmath10 s was determined in the 101000 kev band @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the prompt emission as measured by gbm is well fitted by the band model with a peak energy at @xmath11 kev .",
    "the fluence measured by gbm is @xmath12 erg @xmath13 ( 101000 kev ) .",
    "given a redshift of 0.55 ( see   [ sect : z ] ) , this corresponds to an isotropic equivalent energy @xmath14 erg .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on the spectrosopic detection of a sn associated with grb  101219b . in ",
    "2 we describe our observations , in   3 we present the redshift measurement and the detection of the sn . finally , in ",
    "4 we offer a discussion of how this grb - sn fits in our current understanding of the grb - sn connection .    for the cosmological calculations we assume a @xmath15cdm - universe with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we observed the afterglow of grb  101219b using the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite mounted at ut2 of the eso - vlt on cerro paranal .",
    "x - shooter is an echelle spectrograph with three arms covering the full spectral range from the atmospheric cut - off around 3000   to the @xmath19 band ( 24,800   ) .    an overview of the observations is given in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "for the uvb , vis and nir arms , slit - widths of 10 , 09 , and 09 , respectively , were used .",
    "the binning was @xmath20 in all uvb and vis exposures , and nir - exposures were unbinned .",
    "the slit was always aligned along the parallactic angle , and the instrument has an atmospheric dispersion corrector for the uvb and vis arms .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we report on our detection of the spectral signature of a sn , sn  2010ma , in the fading afterglow spectrum of grb  101219b .",
    "the redshift was measured to be @xmath21 based on our detections of weak mg@xmath22ii absorption lines in the first epoch spectrum . at this redshift",
    ", a sn similar to sn  1998bw can well match our second epoch spectrum .",
    "the broad spectral features indicate high velocities in the expanding ejecta , whereas a normal sn ib / c clearly does not match the observations .",
    "a sn interpretation is consistent with the drop at @xmath23   being due to uv blanketing in the sn spectra , where the uv part is instead dominated by the blue afterglow component .",
    "the host galaxy appears to be relatively faint , which likely contributed to obtain a clean signal from the supernova .",
    "there is little room for host galaxy extinction .",
    "the grb itself is clearly of long duration and has , at the measured redshift , an isotropic equivalent energy of @xmath24 erg .",
    "it has a bright afterglow with a standard light curve , and obeys the @xmath25 ( `` amati '' ) relation .",
    "it is thus fully representative of the high - luminosity , routinely observed high - redshift population of grbs , for which we now can provide a robust , spectroscopic association with a sn .    since 4 out of the",
    "5 previously unambiguously spectroscopically confirmed sn  grbs were in fact rather low luminosity bursts with unusual afterglows and spectral properties , there have been suggestions in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the grb",
    " sn association is only proven for the local universe .",
    "our new association favours a grb - sn connection also for the main population of cosmological grbs .",
    "this confirms previous observations of photometric bumps and tentative spectroscopic sn detections for distant bursts . in the recent compilation by @xcite ,",
    "the evidence for the sn association of grb 101219b was graded just after the five ` ironclad ' cases mentioned in   1 .",
    "the fact that we were able to see the sn component emerge over three epochs with the same instrumentation leaves little room for confusion by afterglow or host galaxy emission  also thanks to the faintness of the host .",
    "the x - shooter spectrograph will with no doubt continue to contribute to this area of research .",
