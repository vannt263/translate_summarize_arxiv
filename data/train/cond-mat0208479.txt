    "<S> since magnetic and optical traps can be tailored and biased with high accuracy @xcite , the weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can provide a further context for je s and reveal novel properties that might not be accessible with other systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently the dc and ac josephson effects in two weakly linked becs have been extensively studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors suggested that as the barrier between the two trapped becs moves adiabatically across the trapping potential , a dc current of atoms between two condensates can be found . </S>",

    "<S> to consider the experimental observability of this phenomenon , we investigate the influence of the initial acceleration and find it plays a crucial role .    </S>",
    "<S> the interacting becs in a trap at zero temperature can be described by a macroscopic wave function @xmath1 having the meaning of an order parameter and satisfying the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath2\\psi { \\bf ( { r},}t{\\bf ) , }   \\label{gpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 the atomic mass , and @xmath6 the s - wave scattering length of the atoms . considering the system proposed in ref . </S>",

    "<S> these equations describe the dynamics of the bose josephson junction ( bjj ) . for the convenience we set the parameters as the same as in ref . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ q2 ] ) , we have @xmath30    firstly , let us review the properties of this system for @xmath31 is fixed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this case ,  @xmath32 and @xmath33 are canonically conjugate variable of a classical hamiltonian @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xmath36 this system exhibits two qualitatively different orbits : rotation and libration . in the rotation regime , @xmath33 increases ( or decreases ) monotonically and @xmath32 oscillates with small amplitude . in the libration regime , @xmath33 and @xmath32 oscillates around the equilibrium point @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the separatrix between the two regimes determined by the saddle point @xmath38 with @xmath39 for large energy @xmath40 the orbit is rotation , whereas for small energy @xmath41 the orbit is libration . the equilibrium point and the saddle point are obtained by equating the right hand sides of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) to zero , yielding @xmath42 and @xmath43    in the rotation regime , since @xmath33 is increasing ( or decreasing ) monotonically with the angular frequency proportion to @xmath44 , from equation ( [ curr ] ) , we find that @xmath45 is a fast oscillation current with frequency proportion to @xmath44 and the upper bound of the current , i.e. , the so - called critical current @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average of @xmath48    in the liberation regime , let @xmath49 considering @xmath50 , from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) we can obtain a pendulum equation : @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we obtain @xmath52 in which @xmath53 and @xmath54 is determined by the energy of the pendulum . </S>",
    "<S> so , one gets @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 for this case , the josephson current is @xmath57.$ ] the critical current is @xmath58 or @xmath59 when @xmath60 .    from the above discussion , for a fixed @xmath31 one can only find the ac current in bjj . </S>",
    "<S> these properties exhibit the analog of the dc voltage case in sjj .    as it has been suggested in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a dc current can be induced by moving the laser barrier across the trap with a constant velocity @xmath61 and exhibit the analog of the critical behavior in sjj s . </S>",
    "<S> now the question arises : can this system exhibit some new properties which can not find in sjj ? to answer this question , let us review the case for sjj . in sjj , we know that the densities of cooper pair in two side of the junctions are equal to each other ( if the materials are the same ) and should hardly change when the dc current exists . </S>",
    "<S> this feature interpreting to the bjj s is that the change in the relative population is very small . to see this feature clearly , </S>",
    "<S> let us assume the initial relative population @xmath62 , since the change in the relative population is very small , the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) can be approximated to @xmath63 @xmath64 differentiating the second of these equations and replacing the first , we have @xmath65 which is a driven pendulum equation . </S>",
    "<S> the first integral of the equation gives the energy of this pendulum @xmath66 and the constant @xmath67+fv\\theta ( 0).$ ] we define the potential @xmath68 when @xmath69 i.e. , @xmath70 it is a washboard potential , its local maximum appears at @xmath71 , and the local minimum appears at @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is an integer@xmath75 we restrict the initial @xmath33 in interval @xmath76,$ ] then the motion of @xmath33 is characterized by the local maximum @xmath77.$ ] if @xmath78 the motion of @xmath33 is an oscillation in the interval @xmath79 $ ] with the frequency @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the solution of @xmath83 . if @xmath84 the motion of @xmath33 is a rotation , i , e . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath33 decreases monotonically , and @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath86 i.e. , @xmath87 the potential is a titled - step potential , @xmath33 is also a rotation with @xmath88 from ( [ curr ] ) , we know it is an ac current when @xmath33 is a rotation .    </S>",
    "<S> to investigate the case when @xmath33 is in oscillation regime , let @xmath89 where @xmath90 from ( [ qqq2 ] ) , we obtain@xmath91 , so , we know that @xmath92 is a small term with @xmath93 @xmath94 then from ( [ curr ] ) we can obtain a dc current ( to zero order of @xmath92 ) @xmath95    from the above discussion , when @xmath33 is in oscillation regime , the current is a dc current with the relative population increasing @xmath96 when @xmath33 is in rotation regime , the current is an ac one . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of @xmath33 is determined by the initial conditions and the driven force @xmath97 if sets the initial conditions : @xmath98 one can obtain a critical velocity @xmath99 for @xmath100 then @xmath101 , it is a dc current , but for @xmath102then @xmath84 the current is in ac regime . </S>",
    "<S> this is a close analog of the critical behavior in sjj .    </S>",
    "<S> however , for the bjj s , the dc current must lead to the change of the relative population . </S>",
    "<S> this feature will give rise to new properties . </S>",
    "<S> taking the change of the relative population into account , we obtain a nonrigid driven pendulum equation @xmath103 in analog to the above discussion , we get the potential @xmath104 this is also a tilted washboard potential for @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the new feature is the local maximum @xmath106 will decrease with @xmath107 increasing@xmath75 if the motion of @xmath33 is an oscillation at the beginning @xmath108 , we will firstly find a dc current with @xmath106 decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation of @xmath33 will not keep when @xmath109 at this moment @xmath33 will start rotating , and then the current will transition to an ac one . </S>",
    "<S> this means the dc current does not keep for all the time , i.e. , the dc current has a lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> so one can have a straightforward definition of lifetime of a dc current as : the lifetime of the dc current @xmath110 is the time at which @xmath111 this definition is consistent with the definition of the critical velocity in sjj s .    the voltage - current characteristic is the most important property in sjj s . </S>",
    "<S> but in bjj , the important physical quantity should be the relative population @xmath32 which can be directly detected . </S>",
    "<S> so , the critical behavior should be characterized by the change of @xmath32 in bjj . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath33 is in oscillation regime , from the above discussion the relative population is increasing . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath33 is rotating , if @xmath112 @xmath113 , @xmath92 is still a small term with @xmath114 @xmath115 hence the relative population is still increasing and @xmath116 ( in the zero order of @xmath92)@xmath75 but if @xmath117 @xmath118 will decrease monotonically , @xmath119 then @xmath120 , the integral of the current : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a finite time , so @xmath32 should hardly increase . </S>",
    "<S> this means that when the motion of @xmath33 changes from oscillation to rotation , the relative population will still increase until @xmath123 so , the more accurate definition of the lifetime of the dc current in bjj should be : the lifetime @xmath124 is the time when @xmath125 , within this time the relative population is increasing , but after this time the relative population will hardly increase and keep on average fixed@xmath75    in fig . 1 , we show the phase diagram relating to the critical onset in the parameter space of @xmath126 and the laser velocity @xmath127 for the initial conditions : @xmath128 @xmath129and@xmath130 the solid line is the lifetime @xmath131 the dashed line is the lifetime @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the step structure implies that the transitions occur in different cycle of the oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the abruptly increase is due to that the transition occurs near the peak of the potential where @xmath133 fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> plots the relative population after the dc current is destroyed , the crosses are the relative population @xmath32 at @xmath134 which are obtained by integrating the eqs ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2])@xmath135 the solid line is the theoretical result given by @xmath136 which shows the theoretical estimation is consistent with the numerical simulation .    from the above discussion , we know that the lifetime of a dc current is also determined by the initial conditions@xmath75 one knows that the initial relative population @xmath137 must be very close to the equilibrium @xmath138 to obtain a dc current , but the initial relative phase can be various . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we plot the lifetime of the dc current for different initial relative phase @xmath139 , where we let the initial population @xmath62 and @xmath140 .    concerning a possible realization of the phenomenon described in this work , one should consider the influence on the initial accelerations . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the initial conditions as : @xmath141 @xmath142 and @xmath143 let the barrier starts moving with a constant initial acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> when its velocity reaches the value @xmath144 we stop accelerating and then keep the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> what we concern is the change on the lifetime of dc current caused by the different initial acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) shows the lifetime for different initial acceleration , where the lifetime is the time duration of a dc current after the acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is for @xmath145 @xmath146 and the dashed line is for @xmath147 @xmath148 we find that for a sudden change of the initial barrier , the influence of the initial accelerations can be negligible , whereas for slow acceleration process the lifetime changes abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> the reason can be given by the following analysis : for a sudden acceleration , the time for accelerating is very short . in this time period , </S>",
    "<S> the change of @xmath33 is small , so does the change of lifetime . on the contrary , in a slowly acceleration process , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 changes greatly ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) ) . because the lifetime is very sensitive to the initial conditions , so the lifetime will change dramatically .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the conserved conditions implies that @xmath31 must be less than @xmath149 to ensure @xmath150 . in another aspect , to ensure the number of the condensed atoms in one well beyond the minimum threshold , @xmath151 has to be less than this value . on the other hand , although the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) is obtained by solving variationally the gpe ( [ gpe ] ) under the approximation @xmath32 @xmath152 it still remains a good approximation even for @xmath153 @xcite . </S>",
