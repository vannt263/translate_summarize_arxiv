    "the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) @xmath0 @xcite is an important function accumulating information about momentum sharing between the quarks of the pion when the latter is in its valence @xmath6 configuration .",
    "it is an inherent element of perturbative qcd calculations of hard exclusive reactions involving the pion . from the solution @xcite , @xcite of the evolution equation for the pion da it follows that independently of its shape at low normalization point @xmath7gev , at large values of the probing momentum the pion da acquires universal asymptotic form : however , in practical calculations , it is very important to know what is the shape of the pion da at moderate and low scales @xmath8 .",
    "the standard measure of the width of the pion da is the value @xmath9 of its second moment with respect to the relative momentum fraction variable @xmath10 .",
    "qcd sum rule give large @xmath11 values for this moment ( compared to @xmath12 for the asymptotic da ) which indicates that the pion da is a wide function for @xmath13gev@xmath14 .",
    "recent lattice calculations @xcite give @xmath15 for @xmath16 values in this region . a direct calculation of the pion da in the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) produces the result that @xmath17 for all values of the momentum fraction @xmath2 , i.e. , that pion da is constant .",
    "the same result was obtained in the `` spectral '' quark model @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath18 for this `` flat '' da is 1/3 , which is compatible with the results of the lattice estimates , though smaller than the result of qcd sum rules .",
    "it should be noted that the usual procedure of reconstructing pion da from its moments in the cz approach ( followed by essentially all other groups ) is to build it as a sum of the lowest ( two or three ) gegenbauer polynomials corresponding to multiplicatively renormalizable components of the pion da evolution decomposition .",
    "since these components have @xmath19 as an overall factor , such a procedure excludes flat das from possible models .",
    "however , this restriction on the pion da model building is just an assumption . in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to analyze the photon - pion transition form factor in a scenario with flat pion da .",
    "the curve for the form factor which we obtain is in a very good agreement with recent babar data @xcite , which is basically the main motivation for our investigation .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , we give an overview of the basic facts about the pion distribution amplitude : its definition , evolution and results concerning its shape .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the photon - pion transition form factor .",
    "we briefly describe pqcd results for this form factor , and then calculate it within the light - front formalism using a model wave function @xmath3 that reproduces flat pion da after integration over quark transverse momentum @xmath20 and rapidly ( exponentially ) decreases for large values of the standard light - front energy combination @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath20 width parameter @xmath22 of this wave function can be easily adjusted to produce a curve practically coinciding with the data fitting curve given in ref .",
    "this value of @xmath22 corresponds to the value @xmath23 for the average transverse momentum squared , which has the magnitude that one would expect for the valence @xmath24 fock component of the pion light - front wave function .",
    "we analyze the structure of the one - loop corrections for a flat da in pqcd , and find out that the optimal value @xmath25 of the normalization scale for a flat da is very small .",
    "we argue that this is an evidence that the flat pion da should not be evolved in our calculation of the photon - pion transition form factor .",
    "finally , we discuss some aspects of the flat pion da scenario and then we summarize the paper .",
    "the pion distribution amplitude @xmath0 may be introduced @xcite as a function whose @xmath26 moments @xmath27 are given by reduced matrix elements of twist-2 local operators @xmath28 or @xcite as the @xmath20-integral @xmath29 of the light - front wave function @xmath30 .",
    "the zeroth moment of @xmath31 corresponds to matrix element of the axial current , and is given by the pion decay constant @xmath1 @xmath32 which is known experimentally . in the conventions that we use , @xmath33mev .",
    "eq.([fpi ] ) gives an important constraint on the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) , fixing the integral under the @xmath31 curve , but it puts no restrictions on its shape .",
    "in fact , the pion da depends on the renormalization scale @xmath8 that is used to define matrix elements of twist-2 local operators : @xmath34 . the evolution equation for the pion da",
    "may be written either in matrix form @xcite @xmath35 ( see also @xcite ) or in kernel form @xcite @xmath36 the solution of the evolution equation was obtained @xcite , @xcite in the form of expansion over gegenbauer polynomials @xmath37^{-\\gamma_{2n } / \\beta_0 } \\right \\ } \\   , \\label{gegen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the anomalous dimension of the composite operator with @xmath39 derivatives , and @xmath40 is the lowest coefficient of the qcd @xmath41-function . as a result ,",
    "when the normalization scale @xmath8 tends to infinity , the pion da acquires a simple form @xcite @xmath42 known as the `` asymptotic da '' .",
    "the question , however , is what is the shape of the pion da at low normalization scales @xmath43 gev .",
    "some qualitative ( and maybe overly simplistic by today s standards ) argumentation about a possible shape of the pion da was given in our 1980 papers @xcite .",
    "namely , in case of a system of two equal - mass non - interacting particles , @xmath44 . when the interaction is switched on , the da broadens . the width @xmath45 of @xmath46 may be estimated as @xmath47 .",
    "hence , for heavy mesons ( e.g. , for @xmath48 particles ) , @xmath49 is rather narrow since @xmath50mev , where @xmath51 is a parameter characterizing interaction strength . on the other hand , taking @xmath52mev for the quarks in the pion , we conclude that @xmath53 is very broad . assuming a simple exponential model @xmath54 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the light - front wave function gives @xmath55   \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the pion da @xmath53 is close to @xmath1 everywhere outside the regions @xmath56 and in these regions , @xmath53 vanishes rapidly .        initially , the pion da appeared in the perturbative qcd expression @xcite @xmath57 for the asymptotics of the pion form factor calculated through a one - gluon - exchange diagram ( see fig.[piff ] ) . here , @xmath58 is the virtuality of the exchanged gluon .",
    "if one takes the flat pion da @xmath59 , both integrals in @xmath2 and @xmath60 logarithmically diverge , which means that pqcd factorization fails in this case .",
    "evidently , the finite size @xmath61 of the pion should provide a cut - off for the @xmath62 integral , which suggests that @xmath58 should be substituted by something like @xmath63 , with the additional term having a meaning of the average of the squared transverse momentum of the quarks .",
    "one may also treat @xmath64 as an effective gluon mass squared",
    ". then the @xmath62 integrals are convergent , but the integral is dominated by the region where the nominal gluon virtuality is @xmath64 .",
    "this means , first , that it is small , and what is even more important , that it is not growing with @xmath5 .",
    "for these reasons , the gluon - exchange line can not be treated as a part of a perturbative short - distance subprocess , in which virtualities of all the lines should be parametrically @xmath65 .",
    "hence , it should be absorbed into the nonperturbative part of the diagram , i.e. into the soft pion wave function .",
    "the pion form factor must be then calculated in some nonperturbative way .",
    "such a calculation was accomplished within the qcd sum rule approach @xcite , with the results close to experimental data .",
    "the same qcd sum rule approach was used @xcite to calculate @xmath66 and @xmath67 moments of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath68 ( which is the original da @xmath0 written as a function of the relative variable @xmath69 and divided by @xmath1 ) . the value of @xmath18 is a quantitative measure of the width of the distribution amplitude . in particular , @xmath18 is zero for the infinitely narrow da @xmath70 , it equals to 1/5 for the asymptotic da ( [ asda ] ) and to 1/3 for the flat @xmath71 da .",
    "the calculation of chernyak and zhitnitsky ( cz ) @xcite gave the result larger than @xmath72 , namely @xmath73 for the `` bare '' value that was attributed to the normalization point @xmath74gev@xmath14 and then renormalized to the reference scale @xmath75gev@xmath14 , which resulted in @xmath76 . without touching a subtle point whether a perturbative evolution to such a low scale is justified , we can say that the cz results clearly indicate that the pion da is a wide function , and a generalized flat da of @xmath77 type could have been used as a model fitting the values of @xmath9 and @xmath78 obtained from the cz calculation .",
    "however , the fitting model @xmath79 was constructed from the sum of two first terms of the gegenbauer expansion ( [ gegen ] ) , which has @xmath19 ( or @xmath80 ) as an overall factor , thus excluding all models with da s that do not linearly vanish at the end - points .",
    "an implicit assumption of the cz calculation is that it is sufficient to take into account only the two lowest condensates @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the operator product expansion ( ope ) for the relevant two - point correlator .",
    "an alternative attitude @xcite is that the quark condensate @xmath83 is just the first term in taylor expansion of the nonlocal condensate @xmath84 that explicitly appears at the initial steps of ope calculations .",
    "modeling @xmath85 is an attempt to include the tower of higher local condensates of @xmath86 type .",
    "the change from purely local approximation @xmath87 to nonlocal condensates ( nlc ) with a smooth function @xmath85 that rapidly decreases for large @xmath88 modifies the qcd sum rule results for the moments of the pion da : they become smaller .",
    "in particular , the initial nlc calculation @xcite gave @xmath89 , and the model da proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite is @xmath90 which is wider than the asymptotic da , but narrower than the flat da .",
    "the nlc method was elaborated in later papers , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "the problem of the nlc approach is that while it attempts to model the towers of @xmath86 condensates , the towers of @xmath91 condensates are neglected .",
    "recently , chernyak @xcite gave a specific example in which the two towers exactly cancel each other .",
    "this means that nlc results may underestimate the value of @xmath92 , and can not exclude a possibility of large @xmath93 values for the second moment and @xmath94 values for the fourth moment of the pion da . on the other hand",
    ", it is quite possible that nlc argumentation is not completely wrong , and cz results overestimate the values of @xmath92 and @xmath95 . in particular , recent lattice calculations @xcite give @xmath96 and 0.27 , respectively , at the scale @xmath97gev@xmath14 , which produces @xmath98 at scales @xmath99gev@xmath14 , but definitely not @xmath100 .",
    "a general comment is that converting the obtained values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 into models for the pion da one should not restrict the models by the requirement that da s must be given by a few first terms of the gegenbauer expansion .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ principle justifying such a requirement : it is just an assumption which may or may not be true .",
    "the form factor @xmath103 relating two ( in general , virtual ) photons with the lightest hadron , the pion , plays a special role in the studies of exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "when both photons are real , the form factor @xmath104 determines the rate of the @xmath105 decay , and its value at this point is deeply related to the axial anomaly @xcite . at large photon virtualities , this form factor has the simplest structure analogous to that of the form factors of deep inelastic scattering . as a result , comparing pqcd predictions @xcite with experimental data , one can get information about the shape of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath106 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath107 for small virtuality of one of the photons , @xmath108 , was measured at @xmath109 colliders by cello @xcite , cleo @xcite and recently by babar @xcite collaborations .",
    "the behavior of photon - pion transition form factor at large photon virtualities was studied @xcite within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization approach for exclusive processes @xcite . since only one hadron is involved , the @xmath110 form factor has the simplest structure for pqcd analysis , with the nonperturbative information about the pion accumulated in the pion distribution amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "another simplification is that the short - distance amplitude for @xmath111 transition is given , at the leading order , just by a single quark propagator .",
    "theoretically , most clean situation is when both photon virtualities are large , but the experimental study of @xmath112 in this regime through the @xmath113 process is very difficult due to very small cross section .        in the lowest order of perturbative qcd , the form factor for transition of _ two _ virtual photons with momenta @xmath114 into a neutral pion with momentum @xmath115 is given by contribution of the handbag diagram ( see fig.[pigg ] ) @xmath116 introducing the asymmetry parameter @xmath117 through @xmath118 and @xmath119 gives @xmath120 thus , if one would know the function @xmath121 , one could ( in principle ) obtain the pion da @xmath106 by inverting the integral transform ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned , this kinematics is very difficult for experimental study . if one of the photons is real , i.e. @xmath122 , the leading - order pqcd prediction is @xmath123 information about the shape of the pion wave function is now accumulated in the factor @xmath124 .",
    "it equals 2 for the infinitely narrow @xmath125 da , for asymptotic da ( [ asda ] ) we have @xmath126 , while cz model ( [ czda ] ) gives @xmath127 . the intermediate distribution ( [ mrda ] ) produces @xmath128 .",
    "thus , in addition to @xmath129 , we have another measure of the width of the pion da , the value of @xmath124 .",
    "note , that for the da s listed above , the ordering in @xmath124 values is the same as the ordering in @xmath129 values .",
    "however , the flat da , for which @xmath129 is smaller than that for the cz model da , generates infinite value for @xmath124 , which is a consequence of the fact that it does not vanish at @xmath130 .",
    "this divergence of the integral for @xmath124 formally means that the standard perturbative qcd factorization approach is not applicable for the flat da case .",
    "but , since the divergence is only logarithmic , one may hope that some minimal fix , like a cut - off , might be sufficient .",
    "the question , of course , is whether there is a real need to use the flat da to describe the data on the photon - pion transition form factor .",
    "recent data on @xmath131 form factor reported by babar collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite are well fitted by the formula @xmath132 for the range 4gev@xmath133gev@xmath14 .",

    "it is easy to notice that @xmath141 can be obtained if one uses the flat da @xmath142 and changes @xmath143 in the pqcd expression for the @xmath144 form factor : @xmath145 as discussed above , the idea to modify propagators @xmath146 in integrals over the light - cone momentum fractions is rather old .",
    "the parameter @xmath147 in such modifications is usually treated as the average transverse momentum of the propagating particle .",
    "however , the immediate observation is that the value @xmath148gev is a little bit too large to be interpreted in such a way .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath149 modification is equivalent to bringing in , _ before the integration over @xmath2 , _ a tower of @xmath150 power corrections , i.e. , higher twists .",
    "but it is known @xcite that the handbag diagram , because of its simple singularity structure , can not generate an infinite tower of power corrections .",
    "indeed , the propagator of a massless quark in the coordinate representation is @xmath151 . expanding the matrix element of the bilocal operator @xmath152",
    "we see that twist-6 and higher terms cancel the singularity of the propagator . hence , there are just two terms in the ope for the handbag contribution : twist-2 term that has @xmath153 behavior and twist-4 term ( corresponding to the @xmath154 operator on the light cone ) that gives @xmath155 contribution . operators with @xmath156",
    "do not contribute , and so there is no infinite tower of @xmath157 terms .      to investigate a possible mechanism capable of generating a cut - off at small @xmath2 ,",
    "let us write the @xmath158 form factor in the light - front formalism .",

    "an important observation is that the correction term in the integrand of eq.([77 ] ) reflects the @xmath20 dependence of the nonperturbative pion wave function . in the gaussian ansatz ,",
    "this _ integrand _ term has an exponentially decreasing rather than a power behavior for large @xmath5 .",
    "this fact alone is sufficient to assert that it can not be classified as a higher - twist term .",
    "it comes from contributions invisible in the operator product expansion , which only sees the terms that have a powerlike behavior in @xmath153 _ before integration over @xmath2_. representing this expression for the form factor as @xmath169 we find that , for the flat da @xmath142 , the function @xmath170 has the following large-@xmath5 asymptotic behavior : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the euler - mascheroni constant . comparing this result with the function @xmath173 ( [ jl ] ) obtained through the @xmath174 modification of the pqcd @xmath168 propagator",

    ", one may notice that the leading - order formula ( [ 75a ] ) of the light - front formalism can be formally written in terms of pion da @xmath249 taken at @xmath250 ( cf .",
    "( [ philb ] ) ) : @xmath251 so , if the most important values are @xmath252 , then one should take @xmath253 ( which is @xmath254 , compare with ( [ 1/r ] ) ) , i.e. again a very small value for large @xmath210",
    ". however , to check if this reasoning extends to the one - loop case , one needs to calculate one - loop corrections in the light - front formalism keeping the @xmath20-dependence in the perturbative part and then convoluting the result with @xmath20-dependent nonperturbative wave function(s ) , which is a task going well beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this paper we discussed a scenario in which pion distribution amplitude is treated as a constant for all values of the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath2 .",
    "we indicated that several approaches , in particular qcd sum rules and lattice gauge calculations give the values for the second moment @xmath9 of the pion distribution amplitude that are compatible with this proposal .",
    "we emphasized that the standard practice of building the model pion das as a sum of two or three lowest terms of the gegenbauer expansion is just an assumption .",
    "such an assumption , however , excludes flat das from the start .",
    "we calculated the photon - pion transition form factor using the light - front formula of lepage and brodsky and incorporating a @xmath6 wave function that gives flat pion da and has a rapid ( exponential , for definiteness ) fall - off with respect to light - front energy combination @xmath21 .",
    "we demonstrated that the use of such a wave function is numerically equivalent to @xmath255 modification of the quark propagator , with the parameter @xmath174 being more than three times larger compared to the average square of the valence quark transverse momentum .",
    "the characteristic feature of our result is logarithmic @xmath256 growth with @xmath5 of the combination @xmath257 .",
    "such a growth is indicated by recent data of babar collaboration @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it looks very important to check these results at other facilities , such as belle .",
    "i thank v.  m.  braun and n.  a.  kivel for bringing the results of babar experiment to my attention and stimulating communication .",
    "my special thanks for discussions are due to m.  v.  polyakov who informed me that he independently reached the conclusion that recent babar data may be explained by a pion da that does not vanish at the end - points ( see ref .",
