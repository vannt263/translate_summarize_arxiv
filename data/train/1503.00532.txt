    "other commonly studied nonlinear vacuum effects encompass direct light - by - light scattering @xcite , photon splitting @xcite , and spontaneous vacuum decay in terms of schwinger pair - production in electric fields @xcite .",
    "besides , recent theoretical studies have focused on optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities based on interference effects @xcite , photon - photon scattering in the form of laser - pulse collisions @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite , photon merging @xcite , and harmonic generation from laser - driven vacuum @xcite .",
    "a central object in the study of such effects is the photon polarization tensor , which is known analytically in several limits , namely for homogeneous electric and/or magnetic fields @xcite ( cf . also @xcite and references therein ) , and generic plane wave backgrounds @xcite ; see @xcite for a more recent derivation and an alternative representation , and @xcite for a novel systematic expansion especially suited for all - optical experimental scenarios .",
    "numerical results for inhomogeneous magnetic backgrounds are available from worldline monte carlo simulations @xcite , and first analytical insights into the photon polarization tensor in various inhomogeneous background field configurations that may locally be approximated by a constant were obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the latter approach is manifestly limited to certain photon polarization modes as the incorporation of the inhomogeneous field profile into the constant field polarization tensor generically induced violations of the ward identity .",
    "in this paper we study probe photon propagation in generic inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields varying in both space and time .",
    "in contrast to previous studies which implicitly assumed constant background fields when extracting the photon polarization tensor from the heisenberg - euler lagrangian ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) , we treat the background field as manifestly inhomogeneous from the outset .",
    "our main interest is on analytical insights beyond the explicitly known field configurations , i.e. , beyond constant and homogeneous and plane wave background fields .",

    "<S> starting from the heisenberg - euler effective lagrangian , we determine the photon current and photon polarization tensor in inhomogeneous , slowly varying electromagnetic fields . to this end , we consider background field configurations varying in both space and time , paying special attention to the tensor structure . as a main result , we obtain compact analytical expressions for the photon polarization tensor in realistic gaussian laser pulses , as generated in the focal spots of high - intensity lasers . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions are of utmost importance for the investigation of quantum vacuum nonlinearities in realistic high - intensity laser experiments . </S>"
