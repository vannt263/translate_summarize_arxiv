    "the reasons for discounting the difference in the location of @xmath181 as significant are    * the best hotqcd data are on @xmath182 with @xmath183 lattices .",
    "three systematic effects , each shifting the estimate by @xmath92 mev to lower temperatures , have been identified .",
    "these are ( i ) the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 lattice data ; ( ii ) extrapolation in light quark masses and ( iii ) the difference between asqtad and p4 data .",
    "a fourth possible shift of @xmath184 mev arises from the recent change in the experimental value of @xmath185 which resulted in lowering the wbc results by @xmath149 mev  @xcite .",
    "this change affects the continuum extrapolation carried out by the wbc and not the hotqcd results presented at fixed @xmath22 with the scale set by @xmath24 .",
    "all four factors are not necessarily independent , however , the point we want to make is that the difference between @xmath186 and @xmath105 mev can largely be accounted for by a combination of these systematic effects . * more important , we have presented reasons for why the two methods used by the wbc to extract @xmath181 , the polyakov loop and strange quark number susceptibility , do not probe the singular structure of the theory .",
    "our contention is that all previous results based on these probes do not qualify as precision measurements .",
    "* probes sensitive to the singular structure ( energy and entropy density and the light quark number susceptibility ) show the two transitions to be coincident for all values of the lattice parameters simulated by the hotqcd collaboration .",
    "it remains to be seen if this conclusion survives after extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "the difference in @xmath161 is less significant than it appears .",
    "all three systematic effects in hotqcd calculations discussed above as well as the change in wbc estimates on using the new experimental value of @xmath185 are again applicable . even though the wbc find that the five quantities ( @xmath24 , the new experimental value of @xmath185 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) used to set the lattice scale give consistent estimates in the continuum limit , there can be systematic differences when working at a given @xmath22 as is the case for the hotqcd data .",
    "assuming these four @xmath149 mev shifts add , as data indicate , the hotqcd estimate would be lowered to @xmath190 mev in the continuum .",
    "this , however , still leaves a difference of about @xmath191 mev that needs to be resolved .",
    "the good news is that the hotqcd simulations underway will allow us to extrapolate to the continuum limit and to the physical light quark mass and thus shed light on these issues .",
    "we hope to have these results within the next year .",
