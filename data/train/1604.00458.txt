    "quantum statistical property is one of the most important properties of the particles in quantum system . according to the exchange symmetry satisfied by the wavefunction of identical particles",
    ", we can distinguish between fermions and bosons .",
    "the former satisfy antisymmetry and the later symmetry under exchange .",
    "it is the case that the identical particles exchange in three dimensions ( and higher dimensions ) systems . in one- and two - dimensional systems",
    "this respect is qualitatively different from the high - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "physicists proposed that there exists a continuum of intermediate cases between bosons and fermions , i.e. , the anyons satisfying the fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "the fractional statistics was used successfully to explain the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite and nowadays play important roles in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "one interest feature of fractional statistics system is the application to quantum information science for the topological protection of quantum coherence of anyons @xcite .",
    "it is the feature that catalyzed the search for the anyons in physical systems such as quantum hall heterostructure @xcite and low dimensional quantum gas .    for the high controllability quantum gas",
    "is a popular platform to simulate the traditional condensed matter system .",
    "several ideas have suggested the creation of anyons with rotated bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . besides the realization and manipulation of anyons in two - dimensional optical lattice , theorists proposed that the one - dimensional ( 1d ) anyon gas of tunable interaction can be created in 1d optical lattice by controlling the transition rate with the raman - assisted hopping technique @xcite .",
    "recently , strter etc . proposed a new mechanism to create anyons in optical lattice by controlling the lattice - shaking - induced tunneling @xcite .",
    "the 1d quantum gas is one of the focuses in cold atom physics both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite since the realization of the bose - einstein condensates . particularly , with feshbach resonance technique",
    "the strong correlated tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite and super tg gas @xcite are achievable . the atomic interaction can be tuned in the full interacting regime with the feshbach resonance technique and confinement - induced resonance technique .",
    "most interestingly , the mechanism proposed by greschner etc . can control the effective interaction between anyons without feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "although the experimental realization of 1d anyon gas in cold atom is still of absence , its theoretical research has been in progress for a long time @xcite .",
    "particularly the @xmath0-anyon gas attracted many research interests in the exact solution @xcite , the low - energy properties @xcite , correlation function @xcite , entanglement properties @xcite , momentum distribution and the reduced one - body density matrix ( robdm ) @xcite , the relaxation dynamics @xcite , quantum walks @xcite and the fermionization @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the properties dependent on the modulus of wavefunction are not related with the statistical properties , while those properties dependent on the wave function exhibit distinct behaviors with the change of the statical parameters .",
    "for example , the density distribution and pair correlation function displays the same behavior as those of bose gas @xcite .",
    "the properties resulted from the fractional statistics are exhibited for robdm and the momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric momentum distribution of anyons is greatly different from the symmetric distribution of fermions and bosons .    for homogeneous anyon gas the exact solution and",
    "therefore the interested properties can be obtained with bethe ansatz method . for the anyon gas in external potential we have to turn to numerical method except that in the strong interaction limit . the strongly interacting anyons can be mapped into spin - polarized fermi gas with anyon - fermion mapping method and the generalized jordan - wigner transformation for the anyons in harmonic potential and in optical lattice , respectively .",
    "have obtained the exact ground state of strongly interacting anyon gas in optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the ground state of strongly interacting anyon gas in a harmonic trap was also investigated by girardeau @xcite where the system was discussed formally , while the robdm and thus the density profiles and the momentum distribution were not investigated . in the present paper we will give the exact analytical formula of robdm and other related quantities .",
    "the formula can be used to investigate the system of large particle number .",
