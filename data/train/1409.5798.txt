    "the physical conditions which enable the formation of the first low - mass and long - lived stars to form in the universe is still a subject of debate . according to the most recent numerical studies of primordial star formation in the first mini - halos",
    ", the final outcome appears to be the formation of a massive stellar binary or of a small multiple of massive stars ( for a recent comprehensive review see bromm 2013 ) .",
    "although this represents a paradigm shift compared to the original  standard model for the first stars \" , which presumed the first pop iii stars to be very massive and to form in isolation , we are still far from being able to predict the resulting stellar mass spectrum .",
    "the best available indications from numerical studies suggest that the first stars formed in a broad mass range , from 10 to 1000 @xmath5 , but that most of them are distributed around a few tens to a few hundred solar masses ( hosokawa et al . 2011 ; greif et al . 2012 ; turk et al .",

    "occasionally , one of the secondary protostars formed during disk fragmentation is seen to migrate to higher stellar orbit and may eventually form a low - mass primordial stars . yet , no evidence for the existence of such primordial low - mass stars has been found in surveys of the galactic halo and in nearby dwarfs ( beers & christlieb 2005 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2009 ) .    once the first supernovae explode and start to seed the gas with metals and dust grains , the physical properties of star forming regions change , eventually allowing the formation of the first low - mass pop ii stars .",
    "gas at low metallicity can achieve larger cooling rates through additional molecular species ( hd , oh , co , h@xmath6o ) , fine structure line  cooling ( mostly oi and cii ) , and thermal emission from dust grains ( omukai 2000 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 ; omukai et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the relative importance of these coolants depends on the density ( time ) regime during the collapse and on the initial metallicity and dust content of the collapsing core .",
    "cooling due to line emission affects the thermal evolution of collapsing cores at low - to - intermediate densities : when the total metallicity of the gas is @xmath7 , molecular cooling dominates at @xmath8 , with an efficiency which increases with metallicity because of the larger molecular formation rate on the surface of dust grains ( omukai et al .",
    "2005 ; schneider et al . 2006 , 2012a ) . for more metal enriched clouds , @xmath9 , oi and cii fine - structure line cooling dominate the thermal evolution at @xmath10 , until the nlte - lte transition occurs and the cooling efficiency decreases .",
    "bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) have derived the critical o and c abundances required to overcome the compressional heating rate and fragment the gas , finding @xmath11_{\\rm cr } = -3.5 $ ] and @xmath12_{\\rm cr } = -3.05 $ ] .",
    "frebel , johnson & bromm ( 2007 ) have further explored the role of metal fine - structure line cooling by introducing the so - called transition discriminant - a combination of the c and o abundances - that enables the formation of pop ii stars when its value exceeds a critical threshold of @xmath13 . comparing this theoretical prediction with observations of metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) and its dwarf satellites",
    ", they find that most of the stars have @xmath14 , with the exception of sdss j102915 + 172927 , a star with @xmath1 = -4.99 $ ] that falls in the forbidden zone for metal fine - structure line cooling ( caffau et al .",
    "note also that given the typical gas temperatures and densities where line - induced fragmentation takes place , the associated jeans ",
    "unstable fragment masses are still relatively large , with masses @xmath15 ( schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) . in a recent numerical simulation , safranek - shrader , milosavljevi & bromm ( 2014 ) have confirmed that there is a clear metallicity threshold for widespread fragmentation between @xmath16 z_{\\odot}$ ] in high - redshift , atomic - cooling halos : fine - structure line cooling allows the gas to cool to the cmb temperatures and form a cluster of size @xmath17  pc , with typical fragment masses @xmath18 , consistent with the jeans masses expected at the end of the fragmentation phase .",
    "although the simulations do not follow the evolution of the cluster to higher densities , taking these results at face value it appears that fine - structure line cooling is not capable of producing solar - mass fragments that have the potential to survive until the present - day , corroborating previous findings based on semi - analytical models ( schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a pervasive fragmentation mode that allows the formation of solar or sub - solar mass fragments is activated at higher gas densities , @xmath19 , when dust grains are collisionally excited and emit continuum radiation , thereby decreasing the gas temperature until it becomes thermally coupled with the dust temperature @xmath20 or the gas becomes optically thick ( schneider et al .",
    "the efficiency of this physical process depends on the dust - to - gas ratio and on the total grain cross - section , with smaller grains providing a larger contribution to cooling ( schneider et al .",
    "hence , the minimal conditions for dust - induced fragmentation have been expressed in terms of a minimal critical dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total cross - section of dust grains per unit dust mass and the expression holds in the regime where dust cooling is effective , hence @xmath23 .",
    "an extensive parameter - space exploration shows that @xmath24 can be considered as a good representative value for the minimal dust enrichment required to activate dust - induced fragmentation ( schneider et al .",
    "these results have been confirmed by numerical simulations ( tsuribe & omukai 2006 , 2008 ; clark et al .",
    "2008 ; omukai et al . 2010 ; dopcke et al .",
    "in addition , the observed properties of sdss j102915 + 172927 provide a strong indication that low - mass star formation may have occurred in the absence of efficient metal - line cooling , supporting a dust - driven transition ( schneider et al .",
    "2014 ; chiaki et al .",

    "this is the environment out of which halos virialize .",
    "the free parameters which describe the merger tree model are the redshift interval ( dz ) and the resolution mass , which are chosen in order to ensure the binarity of the code and the agreement between the resulting mass function of progenitor halos and the theoretically predicted eps distribution over the relevant redshift range .",
    "we also assume that star formation in mini - halos is suppressed by strong radiative feedback effects ( ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "hence , star formation occurs in halos above a minimum mass , @xmath46 , that corresponds to the minimum mass of ly-@xmath47 cooling halos , hence to halos with virial temperature @xmath48 k , @xmath49 ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) . to properly sample the low - mass end of the simulated progenitor mass function , we adopt a resolution mass of @xmath50 . fig .",

    "the comparison shows that there is a good agreement with the eps ( within the error bars ) , particularly for @xmath52 , which is the mass range we are interested in .",
    "an increase in the minimum mass of star forming halos is expected during cosmic reionization , due to the increased jeans mass in ionized regions , which causes the quenching of the gas infall in halos below a given circular velocity @xmath53 or dm halo mass ( gnedin 2000 ; hoeft et al .",
    "2006 ; okamoto , gao & theuns 2008 ) .",
    "while the details of the evolution of @xmath53 depend on the reionization redshift , amplitude of the ionizing background and redshift ( noh & mcquinn 2014 ) , here we simply assume that star formation is quenched in dm halos with circular velocities smaller than @xmath54 when @xmath55 ( salvadori & ferrara 2009 ) .

    "once the free parameters of the model are constrained , we can analyse the properties of the mw progenitors .",
    "the idea is to test if the relations between the dust / metal / gas masses that we predict for our reference model at different evolutionary stages are consistent with the observed scaling relations .",
    "most of the available data refer to galaxies of different masses in the local universe .",
    "hence , a meaningful comparison between mw progenitors at different redshifts and present - day galaxies requires that sources with comparable stellar / dust / gas masses are identified .",
    "hence , we apply different mass selection criteria to the mw progenitors depending on the specific data sample that we consider , as it will be discussed below . + the first sample that we compare with has been recently analyzed by corbelli et al .",
    "it refers to galaxies in the virgo cluster that have been mapped by the herschel satellite ( hevics , davies et al .",
    "2010 ) , observed at 21 cm and in the co ( 1 - 0 ) line .",
    "the sample comprises 35 late - type galaxies in a dynamical range @xmath56 . selecting mw progenitors in the same dynamical range at all redshifts , in the left and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mwprog ] we compare the model predictions with observations .",
    "the behaviour of the simulated progenitors is globally consistent with observed data , with a slope close to the proposed linear regression ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the correlation between the dust mass and total gas mass shows that mw progenitors are generally more gas - rich than typical galaxies in the observed sample , probably as a consequence of the earlier evolutionary stages of the model galaxies , which lie in the redshift range @xmath57 .",
    "it is important to note that galaxies in the corbelli et al .",
    "( 2012 ) sample have been classified to be hi - deficient , probably due to galaxy interactions in the cluster environment where they are embedded .",
    "indeed , the model galaxies show a correlation between the dust and molecular gas masses very close to the observations , while , for a given dust mass , the predicted hi masses are generally a factor @xmath58 larger than observed .",
    "this is further confirmed by looking at the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mwprog ] where we represent - for the same sample galaxies - the correlation between the dust - to - gas mass ratio and the stellar mass .",
    "model predictions show that mw progenitors are characterized by a dust - to - gas ratio that grows with the stellar mass , consistent with the observations . yet , predicted stellar masses are smaller than @xmath59 , which is the final stellar mass predicted for the mw at z = 0 .",
    "hence , we conclude that although the corbelli et al .",
    "( 2012 ) sample comprises late - type galaxies in the virgo clusters , 30% of which have stellar masses larger than the mw progenitors investigated by the present model , the general scaling relations that have been inferred from the observations are well reproduced , with differences that can be ascribed to environmental or evolutionary effects .",
    "additional constraints on the model can be obtained by comparing the predicted correlation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the gas metallicity .",
    "recently , this correlation has been measured over a large metallicity range using different samples of local galaxies , such as the kingfish survey ( kf , kennicutt et al .",
    "2011 ) , the sample collected by galametz et al .",

    ", we also show in the same plot the data collected by zafar & watson ( 2013 ) over a wide redshift range @xmath0 using grb afterglows .",
    "note that while the dust masses in local samples have been inferred from the fir / sub - mm emission , grb afterglows allow to investigate the evolution of dust content in their host galaxies using extinction data .",
    "in particular , following kuo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , for each grb we consider the best - fit extinction curve ( lmc , smc or mw - like ) and compute the dust - to - gas ratio from the observed optical depth and gas column density , using the corresponding correction factor .",
    "the observed data points indicate that the dust - to - gas ratio grows with the metallicity but with a large scatter , particularly at the lowest metallicities .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for the simulated mw progenitors . at low metallicities , dust and metal enrichment",
    "proceed proportionally to the stellar yields . when @xmath61 , the accretion timescale is @xmath62 , gas - phase metals accretion on dust grains becomes efficient , steepening the correlation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity , which is mostly driven by grain growth in dense molecular clouds ( kuo et al .",
    "2013 ; asano et al . 2013 ; zhukovska 2014 ) .",
    "once all gas - phase metals are accreted , a saturation condition is reached and the simulated behaviour is driven again by the corresponding stellar yields .",
    "hence , we have identified 9 different models that we have tested against the observations : these models are characterized by a common set of parameters ( calibrated to match the observed properties of the mw , as discussed in section [ sec : calibration ] ) but differ by the adopted pop iii stellar mass range and/or pop iii sn yields , and by the assumed criterium controlling the pop iii / ii transition . in table",

    "this occurs at different epochs in the three models as a consequence of the different pop iii / ii transition criteria ( at @xmath81 for models c and i , and at @xmath82 for model f ) .",
    "the nature of the first pop ii stars that form in newly virialized halos depends on the [ c / fe ] content of the gm : the vertical - dotted line marks the redshift at which [ c / fe ] = 1 ; for all the three models , the first pop ii stars that form in newly virialized halos are always c - normal .",
    "the typical evolutionary tracks in the first progenitors show that pop iii stars continue to form until the first faint sne explode and enrich the ism above the critical threshold for pop ii star formation .",

    "the major difference is in the duration of the pop iii star formation epoch , that is shorter when a dust - driven transition is adopted . as a result , in model ( f )",
    "c - normal pop ii stars can form at @xmath84 < - 4 $ ] due to early enrichment from pop ii cc - sne .",
    "conversely , in models ( c ) and ( i ) a larger fraction of pop ii stars are c - enhanced due to the larger contribution to gas enrichment from faint pop iii sne .",

    "the contribution of pisn to the first enrichment , if present , must have been largely sub - dominant .",

    "it has been suggested that these differences may provide clues to the nature of their likely progenitors .",

    "long - term radial - velocity observations show that a large percentage of cemp - s / rs stars are binaries ( lucatello et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , the abundance pattern of the cemp - no stars is difficult to explain as caused by a mass transfer from an agb companion and the nature of their progenitors is still largely debated . using a homogeneous chemical analysis of 190 metal - poor stars",

    "it is important to stress that in our model cemp stars can form only as a result of the enrichment from pop iii faint sne , as we do not consider mass - transfer effects in stellar binaries .",

    "<S> , we use an improved version of the semi - analytical code galaxy merger tree and evolution ( gamete ) , that reconstructs the hierarchical merger tree of the mw , following the star formation history and the metal and dust evolution in individual progenitors . the predicted scaling relations between the dust , metal and gas masses for mw progenitors show a good agreement with observational data of local galaxies and of gamma ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies at @xmath0 . comparing the simulated and the observed mdf , </S>",
    "<S> we find that in order to predict the formation of hyper - iron - poor stars at @xmath1 < -4 $ ] , faint sn explosions have to dominate the metal yields produced by pop iii stars , disfavoring a pop iii imf that extends to stellar masses @xmath2 , into the pair - instability sn progenitor mass range . the relative contribution of c - normal and c - enhanced stars to the mdf and its dependence on [ fe / h ] points to a scenario where the pop iii / ii transition </S>",
    "<S> is driven by dust - cooling and the first low - mass stars form when the dust - to - gas ratio in their parent clouds exceeds a critical value of @xmath3 . </S>",
