    "the visual appearance of a galaxy is the manifestation of its star formation history , stellar content and , dynamic and kinematic properties . as a result",
    ", visual morphology of a galaxy can not only provide important clues to its formation mechanisms , but the longevity of specific features such as the spiral structure and bars could potentially be used to understand secular evolution .",
    "it is however a known fact that galaxy properties are modulated by their environment , such that red , bulge - dominated , passively evolving galaxies are mostly found in the dense cores of galaxy clusters and groups , while blue , star - forming , disky , galaxies appear more frequently in less dense environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but can a galaxy evolve from being disky to spheroidal away from the harsh environment of clusters and groups ? to learn about the mechanisms responsible for converting one galaxy population into another , and , any evolutionary links between visually distinct galaxies , it is important to get a complete description of galaxies which are evolving independent of the impact of dense environment .",
    "historically , galaxies were distinguished by visual classification @xcite , supported by quantitative description of their stellar light profile @xcite .",
    "but since hubble s tuning fork diagram , we have come a long way in classifying galaxies based on spectroscopic or photometric data obtained in multiple wavebands .",
    "after morphology , the most popular classification scheme for galaxies is based on luminosity .",
    "most studies based on wide - angle survey data such as those obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , define galaxies fainter than @xmath7mag as dwarfs",
    ". one of the key characteristics of low - luminosity galaxies however , is their low surface brightness which is correlated with their luminosity albeit with considerable scatter @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases like the giant low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy malin i @xcite , and galaxies having extended ultraviolet disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the need to distinguish between low - surface brightness and low - luminosity galaxies might be more critical than immediately intuitive .    the literature on low - luminosity , low surface brightness galaxies is further complicated by incorporation of extensive jargon over the decades .",
    "although dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , ( dwarf ) irregulars ( ( d)irr ) , dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) , dwarf spirals or lenticulars ( ds , ds0 ) , blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) , and little blue spheroids ( lbs ) all have their glorious presence in the extensive literature , it is often not obvious whether the difference between these subpopulations of galaxies extend beyond their morphology , or if one class is related to another or their giant counterparts .    while dwarf ellipticals , which are predominantly found in rich galaxy clusters , have received considerable attention in the context of the dichotomy between des and giant ellipticals ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and , more recently for structure ` hidden ' under the smooth radial profiles @xcite , other classes of low - luminosity galaxies have not been studied much beyond the local volume ( @xmath8mpc ) .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of data and partly due to the low volume density of these galaxies , which are hard to observe and easily missed from observations focussing on interiors of galaxy clusters . within the local volume",
    "however , dwarf galaxies , especially the dwarf irregulars have been well explored at the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is however only with the advent of wide - angle sky surveys in the last decade or so that it is finally possible to measure a sufficient volume of the local universe to sample large numbers of low - luminosity stellar systems outside the extreme environments of clusters .",
    "one such programme is the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which now provides a unique opportunity to analyse the properties of low - luminosity , low surface brightness galaxies because of its very high volume ( almost 20 000 mpc@xmath9 ) at low redshifts .",
    "the gama survey regions were not selected on the basis of environment . with photometric and spectroscopic information for nearby galaxies in hand , in this project",
    "we aim to :    * characterise the galaxies , especially dwarfs , residing away from clusters , * compare the intrinsic and physical properties of visually distinct galaxies with an aim to find evolutionary links between them , and * determine the minimum number of classes which are required to separate galaxies , especially dwarfs , into statistically distinguishable populations .",
    "at this point we emphasise that our unique sample ( 8 - 87 mpc ) helps in bridging the gap between studies of galaxies in the local volume ( @xmath8mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and statistical analyses of galaxies in rich clusters such as virgo ( @xmath10mpc ) and coma ( @xmath11mpc ) .",
    "we characterise the dataset used in this paper and various selection biases that may affect our analysis in the following section . in  [ structure ]",
    "we explain the methods we used for classifying our sample : ( i ) the visual classification scheme , ( ii ) the light profile fitting algorithm which is used to quantify the morphology of galaxies through structural parameters , and , ( iii ) the spectral energy distribution fitting procedure used to estimate the star formation and dust properties of galaxies .",
    "we discuss the relation between various structural parameters obtained from fitting the light profile in ",
    "[ photo ] , and discuss the star formation and dust properties of our sample in  [ sf ] .",
    "various implications of our analysis on the stellar mass function of galaxies and the unimodal nature of galaxies are discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] , along with the limitations of our analysis .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our findings in  [ summary ] .",
    "all distances , magnitudes and masses in this paper are calculated under the assumption of a @xmath12cdm concordance cosmological model with @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey is a combined spectroscopic and multi - wavelength programme that exploits various ground - based and space - borne observing facilities to study cosmology and galaxy evolution .",
    "the spectroscopic campaign is based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; data release 7 ) imaging complete to @xmath17 .",
    "the survey , after completion of phase ii will have photometry in 20 wavebands , from far ultraviolet to radio , and , spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath18 galaxies ( @xmath19 ) in three equatorial regions , each measuring @xmath20 square degrees and two southern fields of similar size @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness completeness limit for the survey is mainly driven by the sdss imaging , and is important for understanding some of the selection biases in our sample .",
    "fainter than this completeness limit the imaging data becomes unreliable .",
    "since the targets for the spectroscopic campaign for are selected in the @xmath21-band , in figure  [ sb ] we show the number distribution of all the ii sources with @xmath22 , survey_class@xmath23 and vis_class@xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the vis_class parameter signifies the likelihood of an object for being a target for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "many of the low - redshift targets are classified as vis_class@xmath26 , implying they are deblended part of a galaxy , and are excluded from our analysis .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ sb ] shows the fraction of galaxies with reliable redshifts ( quality of redshift , @xmath27 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in each bin of surface brightness , in this sample .",
    "as expected , the completeness fraction drops towards fainter surface brightness and goes below 95% at @xmath28magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "this is in agreement with the median 1@xmath29 limit of @xmath30magnitude per square arcsecond derived for i ( @xmath31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since we are mainly dealing with low - luminosity and low - surface brightness galaxies in this paper , we adopt a conservative surface brightness completeness limit of @xmath32magnitude per square arcsecond , consistent within the limit advocated in @xcite .",
    "the sample used in this work is selected from the ii catalogue such that @xmath27 and @xmath33 ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the local flow correction ) .",
    "this redshift range is optimally chosen to exclude galactic stars and enable visual classification of low - luminosity and low surface brightness galaxies in the shallow imaging data from the sdss .",
    "all images were visually inspected for any remaining artefacts , stars and duplicates resulting in the final catalogue of 432 galaxies ( including those fainter than @xmath32magnitude per square arcsecond ) which is used throughout this paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "all magnitudes used in this work are corrected for galactic extinction and k - corrected to @xmath34 using kcorr_z00v03 @xcite and galacticextinctionv02 data management units for ii .",
    "while ii is 99% complete for galaxies down to @xmath17 , figure  [ sb ] shows that the surface brightness incompleteness starts becoming significant at @xmath35magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "this limit thus restricts the overall angular size of the detected galaxies such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the limiting effective surface brightness , magnitude and limiting size for the sample , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed derivation of the formula ) .",
    "the vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy survey ( _ viking _ ) will cover 1,500 square degrees of sky in five broadband filters ( @xmath40 ) with the 4.1 metre visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) , located at the paranal observatory in chile .",
    "the _ viking _ data has @xmath41 better resolution ( @xmath42 ) , and depth approximately two magnitudes deeper than the sdss .    since the parent sample was selected in the @xmath21-band , while here we choose to present the analysis in the _ viking _",
    "@xmath3-band , we need to evaluate the limiting values for all parameters in the @xmath3-band .",
    "the difference between the sdss @xmath21-band and the _ viking _ @xmath3-band magnitudes for our sample galaxies is in the range @xmath43 , with a mean difference of 0.31 magnitude and standard deviation of 0.36 magnitude , respectively . for @xmath44 of the galaxies with data in both wavebands ,",
    "the mean difference in the effective surface brightness within the effective radius is 0.35 magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "based on the above mentioned differences , in the following we assume a limiting effective surface brightness of @xmath45magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "the limiting magnitude @xmath46mag at our @xmath47 in the @xmath3-band translates to @xmath48 .",
    "as we discuss in section  [ paperintro ] , most previous studies of low - luminosity galaxies focus on the dense environment of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "there are however , no massive clusters or groups in any of the three equatorial regions at @xmath49 as demonstrated by the redshift distribution of galaxies in figure 5 of @xcite . in order to quantify environment for our sample",
    ", we also made use of the gama group catalogue @xcite .",
    "however , due to the high lower redshift limit of this catalogue , the clustering information based on the friends - of - friends method is only available for a subsample of 263 of our galaxies at @xmath50 .",
    "of these 263 , 11 galaxies are found in groups with multiplicity @xmath51 , and another 25 are in pairs .    together",
    ", these properties demonstrate that the galaxies in our sample avoid the very dense cluster environments typical of most previous dwarf galaxy samples .",
    "this does not however imply that they are entirely isolated , but do satisfy our aim to determine the properties of galaxies evolving away from the influence of dense environments .",
    "we adopt three independent methods for the classification of galaxies : visual classification based on inspecting the five - colour sdss images , quantitative structural analysis based on the modelling of the light profile of galaxies , and star formation properties obtained by fitting the spectral energy distribution of galaxies .",
    "we describe each of these methods below .      the visual appearance of galaxies has historically been used to understand their evolutionary sequence and formation mechanisms by separating them into classes .",
    "the hubble tuning fork diagram @xcite , for instance is in use to the present day .",
    "the hubble sequence , which was designed to be an evolutionary sequence in morphological types , can also be interpreted as a sequence in gas content , mass , and bar structure of galaxies , all of which are in a symbiotic relationship with their global star formation rate ( sfr ) and dynamic environment .",
    "one of our key motivations for this project is to test if galaxies that can visually be classified into separate classes , are statistically distinguishable in other properties , indicative of an evolutionary link between them . to accomplish this , mahajan visually classified the five colour sdss images of all galaxies ( @xmath52 ) five times , classifying them into six categories as detailed below . in this redshift range",
    "the physical resolution of the sdss images is around @xmath53kpc .",
    "the classification scheme was designed without any presumptions about how many categories were required . in other words ,",
    "a new category was created based on the imaging data if there appeared to be galaxies which shared common traits in their appearance , but did not fit into any of the existing classes .",
    "mahajan , driver and drinkwater also visually classified the three - colour images in the @xmath54 wavebands . on average ,",
    "the various classifiers agreed 80% of the time with the low - surface brightness galaxies and blue spheroids with red centres appearing as the most doubtful cases . amongst different types , different classifiers disagreed with themselves and with each other for galaxies mostly classified as irregulars ; a non - negligible fraction of the irregular galaxies were equally likely to be classified as an lsb or a blue spheroid .",
    "the visual classification scheme was designed to categorise all galaxies using their broadband colour and morphology . where possible however , broadband colour was not accounted for in order to simplify the morphology classification scheme ( figure  [ irr ] ) .",
    "the different classes and total number of galaxies in each class are :    * _ elliptical ( e ; 21 ) : _ galaxies which are morphologically elliptical in shape .",
    "they are mostly red in colour . * _ spirals ( sp ; 47 ) : _ galaxies showing well - defined spiral arms or clearly identifiable edge - on disks .",
    "these galaxies often show conspicuous signs of ongoing star formation , such as hii regions , and stellar associations forming spiral arms . *",
    "_ lenticulars ( l ; 26 ) : _ red , disk galaxies with a resolved nucleus .",
    "these galaxies are mostly big and bright , occasionally showing signs of some ongoing star formation in rings around nucleus , or low surface brightness disks without spiral arms . * _ blue spheroidals ( bsph ; 73 ) : _ colour plays a key role in successfully identifying these galaxies .",
    "they are very blue and generally compact spheroids , morphologically similar to small elliptical galaxies or bulges of spiral galaxies . *",
    "_ low surface brightness ( lsb ; 69 ) galaxies : _ these extended objects show very poor contrast with the background in the five - band sdss imaging .",
    "we note that a substantial fraction of these galaxies may have been misclassified due to the very shallow imaging data used here .",
    "many of these galaxies may also be classified as irregular , and as we will show below , these two classes overlap in most of the parameter space explored here . * _ irregulars ( irr ; 196 ) : _ all confirmed extended sources that do not belong to any of the above categories .",
    "we did not use luminosity in our classifications and avoided labelling galaxies as dwarfs or giants based on appearance alone because the angular size of galaxies is a function of redshift .",
    "however , the resulting classifications were a strong function of luminosity with the last three classes listed above ( bsph , lsb and irr ) dominating the low luminosity galaxies ( as shown in figure  [ m - r ] ) .",
    "the mean fraction of these galaxies in the whole sample is 78 per cent , with the fraction increasing from zero at @xmath55 to 100 per cent at @xmath56 ; it reaches the mean fraction at a luminosity of @xmath57 .",
    "this is equivalent to the @xmath7mag limit for dwarf galaxies discussed above .",
    "we therefore refer to galaxies with @xmath58 collectively as dwarfs in order to make the following discussions more concise , unless stated otherwise .",
    "starburst@xcite employs a range of image analysis software and logical filters to perform structural analysis on an input catalogue of galaxies . at the heart of starburstlies source extractor @xcite , psf extractor ( psfex ; *",
    "* ) and galfit 3 @xcite , which are aided by additional packages in the fitting process .",
    "detailed explanations for various packages and their respective roles in the fitting process are given by @xcite .",
    "starburstonly requires the image and the position of the primary galaxy therein as an input .",
    "it then outputs magnitude , fitted sky background and the fit parameters described below .",
    "galfit fits a single srsic function to each primary galaxy with seven free parameters : object centres @xmath59 and @xmath60 , total integrated magnitude @xmath61 , effective radius along the semi - major axis , srsic index @xmath1 , ellipticity and position angle .",
    "secondary objects in the image are modelled by either a single srsic function or a scaled point spread function ( psf ) for stars , as appropriate .",
    "the psf comprises three free parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "see @xcite for more information on the fitting process . a single srsic function which describes the light profile of a galaxy as a function of its radius",
    "is given by the srsic equation @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the intensity at radius @xmath21 , @xmath64 is the intensity at the effective radius , the approximate radius containing half of the total light , and @xmath1 is the srsic index which determines the shape of the light profile of a galaxy . the value of @xmath65 is a function of the srsic index .",
    "a large number of profile shapes can be fitted by varying @xmath1 ; @xmath66 gives a gaussian profile , @xmath67 an exponential profile suitable for galaxy discs , and @xmath68 a de vaucouleurs profile mostly associated with spheroids such as giant elliptical galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description of the srsic model ) .",
    "the quality of fits can be judged from figure  [ sigma ] , which shows a typical example of fitted light profile for each morphology class discussed above .",
    "although @xmath69 of our sample galaxies are fitted well by sigma , the single component srsic model does not fit the centre of the nucleated larger galaxies , spirals and lenticulars , well . the number of galaxies in each morphology class whose light profile could not be adequately fitted by starburstare presented in table  [ fit - stats ] .",
    "we note that some of the galaxies may have more than one issue and hence are counted more than once for this table . we discuss some limitations of the single component srsic model and its impact on the presented analysis further in  [ limit ] .",
    "it is however notable that only 2/21 elliptical galaxies in this sample may require a nuclear component , suggesting that in contrast to the ( dwarf ) elliptical galaxies in clusters @xcite , most of the low - luminosity elliptical galaxies are not nucleated ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .        in this appendix",
    "we illustrate the monte carlo approach we used to estimate uncertainties in the statistics used to select the best number of clusters from the k - means analysis .",
    "as noted above ( section  [ s : nclus ] ) , we used the @xcite variance ratio as a figure - of - merit .",
    "we used the nbclust package @xcite for all the calculations , but this did not provide uncertainties for the calculated variance ratios .",
    "we applied a simple monte - carlo approach to estimate the variance ratio uncertainties by repeating each calculation 30 times using a different random seed for the k - means partition algorithm each time .",
    "we used the mean value of the 30 calculations as the final value of the statistic and the standard deviation of the 30 values to estimate an uncertainty ( the standard error of the mean ) which we show using the red symbols in figure  [ varplot ] for each of the three partitions shown in figure  [ kmeans ] .",
    "as the standard errors on each point are very small we also show the standard deviations ( in grey ) for comparison .",
    "we also show the results of a single calculation , showing that quite strong systematic trends can be present ( e.g.  for 6 - 10 clusters in the first panel ) : this is an additional reason to take the mean of several calculations .    in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of figure  [ varplot ]",
    "there is a clear local maximum of the variance ratio ( at 2,3 clusters respectively ) that is separated by more than 3 standard errors ( the smaller error bars ) from the adjacent points . in panel ( b )",
    "the first point is barely three standard errors higher than the second , but we take the preferred number of clusters as two using our rule to take the smaller number of clusters in the case of a double peak ."
