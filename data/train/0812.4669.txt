    "it is an old misconception that statistical physics and thermodynamics can be derived from the laws of mechanics and dynamical systems .",

    "however , in order to solve the clusterization problem , computer simulation based , as a rule , on the laws of mechanics is usually used .",
    "for example , from a mechanical point of view , to obtain a dimer , i.e. , a coupled pair of particles , a `` collision '' ( interaction ) of three particles must occur ( so that part of the energy is imparted to one of them , and only this results in a mechanical capture ) .",
    "although modern computers are powerful , one can _ a priori _ expect the wrong answer .",
    "the main equation of statistical physics , the boltzmann equation , can not be obtained , in principle , solely from mechanical laws . in principle , it can be derived ( but not in the near future ) from quantum field theory , in which there are no _ a priori _ prescribed pair interactions .",

    "let us quote :  as is known , the existence of nuclear spin leads to the so - called hyperfine splitting of atomic levels .",
    "however , the intervals of this structure are so tiny that they can be regarded as small intervals as compared with @xmath5 for all the temperatures for which the gas exists as gas .  this",

    "we must bear in mind that its interpretation as a distribution density is false in the general case , but valid only in the cumulative variant .",

    "this is borne out by the history of new discoveries in physics .",
    "thus , the great physicist boltzmann , virulently attacked by his contemporaries , committed suicide by throwing himself down the well of a staircase .    in 1900 , planck proposed his famous formula describing black body radiation , which gave results coinciding with experiments , but which he had not rigorously established .",
    "the mathematician bose from india noticed that , in order to derive the formula , one must use a new statistic instead of the old one , the so - called boltzmann or gibbs statistic .",
    "it is possible that planck was also aware of this statistic , but was afraid of being criticized or did not really believe in his own result .",
    "bose , just like boltzmann , was the object of virulent criticism , until einstein gave his approval to the proposed statistic , which was also justified by the philosophical concepts of ernst mach .",
    "at first , physicists were bewildered and could not understand the bose statistic , because they could not imagine how moving particles can exchange positions without using up any energy .",
    "these two statistics have been illustrated above by a simple financial example .",
    "the reply to the bewilderment of physicists was given by mach s philosophical conception , claiming that the basic notions of classical physics ( space , time , motion ) are subjective in origin , and the external world is merely the sum of our feelings , and the goal of science is to describe these feelings .",
    "therefore , if we are unable to distinguish particles in our subjective perception , then they are undistinguishable .",
    "i propose a completely different philosophy .",
    "we can regard particles as distinguishable as well as undistinguishable .",
    "this only depends on the aspect of the system of particles that we are interested in , i.e. , depends on the question we are seeking an answer to .",
    "thus , returning to the money example , people are interested in the denominations of the bank notes they own , not in their serial numbers ( unless , of course , they believe in  lucky numbers  ) .",
    "the situation in physics is similar .",
    "suppose we have a receptacle filled with gas consisting of numerous moving particles .",
    "if we take a slow snapshot of the gas , the moving particles will display `` tails '' whose lengths depend on the velocity of the particle : the faster the motion , the longer the tail .",
    "using such a photograph , we can determine the number of particles that move within a given interval of velocities .",
    "and we do nt care where which individual particle is located and which particular particle has the given velocity .",
    "i have derived formulas which show how the number of particles is distributed with respect to velocity , for example , they show for what number ( numerical interval ) it is most probable to meet a particle moving with a velocity in that interval .    these formulas lead to a surprising mathematical fact : there exists a certain maximal number of particles after which the formulas must be drastically modified .",
    "if the number of particles is much less than this maximal number , the formulas coincide with the gibbs distribution up to multiplication by a constant . nevertheless , this is essential , because the corrected gibbs formula thus obtained no longer leads to the gibbs paradox .",
    "the paradox now bearing his name was stated by gibbs in his paper  on the equilibrium of heterogenous matter ,  published in several installments in 1876 - 1879 , and resulted in great interest on the part of physicists , mathematicians , and philosophers .",
    "this problem was studied by h. poincare , g. lorentz , j. van - der - waals , v. nernst , m. planck , e. fermi , a. einstein , j. von neumann , e. schrodinger , i. e. tamm , p. v. bridgeman , l. brillouin , a. lande and others , among them nine nobel prize laureates .    from my point of view",
    ", the solution of the gibbs paradox can be obtained once we realize that the gibbs formula in its classical form is invalid and we modify it in the way that i have indicated .",
    "this modification was previously interpreted as a consequence of quantum theory , but this is erroneous from the mathematical point of view , since the passage from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics can not change symmetry and therefore can not change the statistics .    in this situation , the following phenomenon , rather strange from the mathematical point of view , arises .",
    "if the number of particles is greater than the maximal number indicated above , then the `` superfluous '' particles , as we already explained , do not fit into the obtained distribution and the velocity of these particles turns out to be much less than the mean velocity of particles in the gas .",
    "this effect differs from the bose - einstein condensate phenomenon from quantum theory , because in quantum theory these particles are at the very lowest energy level , they have the lowest speed , i.e. , roughly speaking , they stop .",
    "further , i try to give a physical interpretation to the obtained rigorous mathematical formulas .",
    "i interpret the maximal number of particles mentioned above as oversaturated vapor ; the superfluous particles are then regarded as nuclei around which droplets begin to grow . as a result",
    ", this can explain the so - called phase transition of the first kind , in which , as the result of the system achieving equilibrium , the number of particles changes from that number for an oversaturated gas to that for a saturated one .",
    "indeed , it is only those particles which move at speeds greater than the speed of the `` superfluous '' particles that can be doubtlessly regarded as particles of the `` pure '' gas ( vapor ) , while the others have condensed or have mixed with the condensed particles ( clusters ) .    in section 1 ,",
    "i cited an example from economics , similar to the one above , that supports exchangeability theory ( instead of the  independence condition  ) . in my opinion",
    ", we must revise , in this vein , the  gibbs conjecture on thermodynamic equilibrium ,  which is based ( see @xcite ) on the property of independence leading to the theorem on the multiplication of probabilities .",
    "it is this conjecture that leads to the gibbs distribution , which is refuted by the gibbs paradox , i.e. , in essence , by the mathematical counterexample to this conjecture , as mentioned above .",
    "it is difficult for physicists to grasp this problem , because it involves a mathematical effect of the type of bose condensation , which results in the appearance of a ",
    "bose condensate ,  which , from the author s point of view , has been treated as some coagulation of particles with low velocities and the formation of dimers , trimers , and other clusters .",
    "the phenomenon of the appearance of dimers is usually obtained by modeling involving the initial conditions and interactions , for example , of lennard - jones type . according to the author s point of view ,",
    "if this phenomenon involves interaction , then it can occur before the switching - on of an interaction of lennard - jones type : as far as the specific volume is concerned , we still deal with an ideal gas .",
    "such type of interaction is observed , for example , in the gas  @xmath223 ( fullerene ) possessing very weak attraction ( of order @xmath224 ) .",
    "it is related to the asymmetry of the molecules and the types of adjoining faces of the molecules of  @xmath223 .",
    "this is much easier to observe experimentally , because fullerene has no liquid phase and is immediately transformed into fullerite particles .",
    "the presence of such a  saturated  total number of particles in the problem under consideration , with surplus particles going somewhere ( passing into the bose condensate ) , is a mathematical fact rigorously proved together with clear estimates of where such aggregates may occur .",
    "however , it is not quite correct to say that the particles are added .",
    "indeed , it is better to say that we lowered the temperature , while using a piston to maintain a constant pressure , and hence the saturated total number of particles is decreased .",
    "and we can simply say that , for a given temperature , the pressure is increased until the @xmath1-transition occurs in the `` bose condensate . ''",
    "the question is : where have the other particles gone if the temperature is lowered simultaneously with the pressure limitation or the pressure at the given temperature becomes sufficiently large ?",
