    "<S> freely falling point particles in the vicinity of kerr black holes are subject to a conservation law , that of their carter constant . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the conjecture that this conservation law is a special case of a more general conservation law , valid for arbitrary processes obeying local energy momentum conservation . under some fairly general assumptions we prove that the conjecture is false : there is no conservation law for conserved stress - energy tensors on the kerr background that reduces to conservation of carter for a single point particle .    </S>",
    "<S> the validity of conservation laws in physics can depend on the type of interactions being considered . </S>",
    "<S> for example , baryon number minus lepton number , @xmath0 , is an exact conserved quantity in the standard model of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is no longer conserved when one enlarges the set of interactions under consideration to include those of many grand unified theories @xcite , or those that occur in quantum gravity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the subject of this note is the conserved carter constant for freely falling point particles in black hole spacetimes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , this quantity is not associated with a spacetime symmetry or with noether s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> instead it is obtained from a symmetric tensor @xmath1 which obeys the killing tensor equation @xmath2 @xcite , via @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is four - momentum . </S>",
    "<S> is this conservation law specific to freely falling particles , or does it persist in the presence of more general interactions ?    </S>",
    "<S> the carter constant conservation law has already been generalized in a variety of directions :    * it applies to charged particles in rotating charged black hole spacetimes @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> it has been generalized to spinning test particles , to linear order in the spin @xcite . * for a free scalar field on the kerr background , carter showed that the differential operator @xmath5 commutes with the dalembertian , which implies the existence of a conserved quantity for the field @xcite . for a free complex scalar field @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> the charge associated with the conserved current @xmath7/2 $ ] is a generalization of the carter constant for particle motion , in the following sense . </S>",
    "<S> solutions of the form @xmath8 $ ] in the eikonal limit @xmath9 can be interpreted as streams of particles , and the conserved charge is just the sum of the carter constants of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is valid for both massive and massless fields . </S>",
    "<S> * there is also a conserved quantity for spin @xmath10 fields related to the killing tensor . on the kerr spacetime </S>",
    "<S> the killing tensor can be expressed as the square of an antisymmetric killing - yano tensor @xmath11 , for which @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carter and mclenaghan @xcite showed that the operator @xmath14 commutes with the dirac operator and so gives rise to a conserved quantity . </S>",
    "<S> a similar construction for spin-1 fields can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> recently , ashtekar and kesavan have shown that in spacetimes which settle down at late times to a kerr black hole , the killing tensor at future null infinity can be expressed as a linear combination of products of asymptotic symmetry vector fields ( bms generators ) , allowing them to compute a charge associated with any cut and derive an asymptotic conservation law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> * there is no known general local conservation law associated with the killing tensor for spin 2 fields in kerr , that is , for linearized vacuum perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are hints that a conserved current may exist in this case . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for the radiation - reaction inspirals of point particles into black holes , it is possible to compute the time averaged time derivative of the particle s carter constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result consists of two terms , a term involving the amplitudes of the gravitational wave modes at future null infinity that is naturally interpreted as a flux to infinity , and a term involving the amplitudes of the modes at the horizon that is naturally interpreted as a flux down the horizon .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we consider a different possible type of generalization of the conservation law , the possibility that the carter quantity may be conserved under local interactions between particles that obey local stress energy conservation . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , suppose we are given a conserved symmetric tensor @xmath15 on the kerr spacetime , with compact spatial support . </S>",
    "<S> does there exist a quantity @xmath16 which can be computed from @xmath15 and its derivatives on any cauchy surface @xmath17 , which has the properties that ( i ) @xmath16 is independent of @xmath17 , and ( ii ) @xmath16 reduces to the carter constant for a single point particle ? </S>",

    "<S> [ ans ] such functionals satisfy property ( ii ) if the bitensor @xmath18 reduces to the killing tensor @xmath1 in the coincidence limit @xmath19 ( see [ explicit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , they do not necessarily satisfy property ( i ) . </S>",

    "<S> no such conservation law exists . </S>",
    "<S> there is a very simple argument which shows this , which is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> consider a freely falling particle @xmath20 in the kerr spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that at some point @xmath21 , it splits into two particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , obeying energy - momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the four - momenta @xmath24 of the particles are related by _ </S>",
    "<S> a(p ) = k_b(p ) + k_c(p ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the initial four - momenta and masses of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are carefully chosen so that these two particles , after falling freely for some time , come together again at some other spacetime point @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> at that point the two particles combine to form a fourth particle , @xmath26 , again obeying energy - momentum conservation : _ </S>",
    "<S> d(q ) = k_b(q ) + k_c(q ) . between the collisions , the carter constants of the individual particles </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 etc , of the individual particles are locally conserved .    now </S>",
    "<S> , if a general conservation law of the type discussed above existed , then at early times the putative conserved quantity @xmath28 would be simply the carter constant of @xmath20 , i.e @xmath29 similarly at late times would depend on the details of how the conserved quantity is supposed to be computed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the model ( [ ans ] ) it would depend on values of the bitensor @xmath30 away from the coincidence limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is why we need to consider a process that begins and ends with a single particle , in order to get a clean test of the conjecture . ] </S>",
    "<S> it would be @xmath31 however , by numerically integrating the geodesic equations in kerr , it is easy to find examples of scenarios of this kind where the initial and final values ( [ eq : initial ] ) and ( [ eq : final ] ) do _ not _ coincide ( see [ numerical ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs whenever the cross term @xmath32 has different values at @xmath33 and @xmath25 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> generalizations of the carter constant conservation law are relevant to the program of computing gravitational wave signals from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might have hoped for a unified conservation law for `` carter '' , analogous to that for energy , that some combination of the carter constant of the particle and the `` carter '' in the gravitational wave field be conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the result presented here suggests that no such unified law exists .    </S>",
