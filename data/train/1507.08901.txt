    "to analyze the phc  mm phase transition , we investigate theoretically electromagnetic properties of the dielectric periodic medium depending on the dielectric contrast , filling ratio and incident wave polarization . as an illustrative example",
    ", we consider here 2d square lattices of parallel dielectric circular rods infinitely long in the @xmath6 direction with the radius @xmath3 and real frequency independent permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "the rods are embedded in air ( @xmath7 ) and the arrays can be characterized by the filling ratio @xmath0 .",
    "we have derived three key sets of spectroscopic data ( see methods ) , namely : ( i ) spectra of the mie scattering by an isolated rod ; ( ii ) photonic band structure of an infinite 2d square lattice composed of rods ; and ( iii ) transmittance of a 2d square lattice of 10 layers in length .",
    "all data sets have been calculated for a wide range of the rod permittivity @xmath8 with the step of @xmath9 ( @xmath1-scenario ) and in the range of filling ratio @xmath10 with the step of 0.01 ( @xmath0-scenario ) .",
    "note that at @xmath11 all rods touch each other and at @xmath12 the rods penetrate into each other and the structure appears as inverted one of air holes in a dielectric matrix .",
    "the calculated data ( see methods ) allow us to analyze precisely the evolution of the low - frequency region of the photonic band structure formed by a complicated mixture of the dispersion curves originating from mie and bragg resonances and propagating modes . since our goal is to discuss the phc ",
    "mm transition , we concentrate on the te polarization where the lowest te@xmath13 magnetic dipole resonance of the rods results in a negative magnetic permeability in the mie gap spectral region @xcite .    the physics of the phc ",
    "mm transition is displayed by the gap map ( fig .",
    "2 ) that relates the bragg and mie gaps positions to the rod permittivity @xmath1 for given @xmath14 .",
    "these illustrate essential features such as strong decreasing of mie resonance frequencies with @xmath1 increase followed by intersection of the mie and bragg bands .",
    "the mie resonances of individual rods form both non - dispersive flat bands in the photonic structure and mie photonic gaps in the energy spectrum ( figs .",

    "all mie resonances are located is a frequency range higher than the lower bragg gap . with increasing rod permittivity @xmath1",
    ", the mie resonances of single rods and correspondingly mie bands of the structure demonstrate a shift from the higher to low frequencies , crossing the strongly dispersive bragg bands .",

    "each tube has a length of 1 m ( along @xmath6-axis ) , an outer radius of 2 cm and an inner radius of 1.7 cm .",
    "all tubes are connected in a closed series circuit together with a water heater and a temperature stabilizer .",
    "insert : schematic illustration of the transformation of the 2d square lattice composed of dielectric rods as the lattice constant @xmath2 increase .",

    "the rods with dielectric permittivity @xmath1 and fixed radius @xmath3 are embedded in air ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the material is homogeneous along the @xmath6 direction and periodic along @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "]          armed with the results of our calculations , we verify our concept experimentally by engineering a metacrystal composed of plastic circular tubes filled with water and forming a 2d square lattice with variable lattice constant @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the structure of the metacrystal enables us to perform two types of experiments according to the @xmath0 - and @xmath1-scenarios .",
    "the @xmath0-scenario was realized using a special construction of the metacrystal that makes it possible to change the distance between tubes synchronously in @xmath17 and @xmath15 directions keeping the 2d square symmetry of the lattice ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for the @xmath1-scenario",
    ", we employ the advantages of strong temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity of water that is characterized by @xmath18 at 20@xmath19c and @xmath20 at 90@xmath19c in the microwave frequencies range from 1 ghz to 6 ghz @xcite .",
    "based on the calculated results and the parameters of the metacrystal , we chose intervals of most interest for each scenario , namely @xmath21 at @xmath22 for the @xmath1-scenario and @xmath23 at @xmath24 for the @xmath0-scenario .",
    "the transmission spectra of the metacrystal installed in an anechoic chamber were measured in the 1 ghz to 3 ghz range .",
    "a rectangular horn antenna ( trim 0.75 ghz to 18 ghz ; dr ) connected to a transmitting port of the vector network analyzer agilent e8362c was used to approximate plane - wave excitation .",
    "a similar horn antenna was employed as a receiver . for the electromagnetic wave incident perpendicular to the tube axis @xmath6 , the two transverse polarizations appear decoupled and the vector wave problem can be reduced to two independent scalar equations . as a result",
    ", the modes of 2d phcs can be classified as either transverse - electric modes te ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) with the electric field confined to the @xmath28 plane and the magnetic field polarized along the axes of the rods , or transverse - magnetic modes tm ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) for which the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the rod axis @xmath6 . for the tm polarization",
    "such structures can not show any magnetic activity @xcite , so we only consider te - polarization .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates excellent agreement between the measured and calculated transmission spectra both for @xmath0 - and @xmath1 - dependencies . for the @xmath0-scenario",
    ", we started our experiment from the phc phase ( @xmath32 ) and compressed the structure by decreasing the lattice constant @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "4**a * * ) .",
    "the lowest bragg gap demonstrates remarkable shift towards high - frequency region , then nearly almost disappears at @xmath33 when it approaches the unchanging te@xmath13 mie gap from the low - frequency side , and finally appears again at @xmath34 on the high - frequency side of the mie gap . as a result , the lowest bragg band and the te@xmath13 mie band change their positions in the energy scale inaugurating the transition into mm phase . in contrast , for the @xmath1-scenario , the bragg gap position changes very slowly as opposed to the strong shift of the te@xmath13 mie band that finally leads to the same general result ( fig . 4**d * * ) .",
    "figure 5**a * * shows our main result : the phc - mm phase diagram for the 2d square lattice of circular rods .",
    "the axes represent the dielectric permittivity @xmath1 and filling ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the phase diagram was obtained based on 50 gap maps ( such as in fig .",
    "2 ) calculated in the permittivity region @xmath8 with the step @xmath35 for te polarization . the diagram is divided into two areas , which represent the phc and mm phases . the transition from phc - phase to mm - phase can be identified by critical points which are defined by a special combination of permittivity @xmath1 and filling ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the curvature of the second dispersion curve around the @xmath36 point decreases and finally becomes perfectly flat along the @xmath36x path ( at @xmath37 , @xmath14 , fig .",
    "6**d * * ) . with future increase in @xmath1 or change in @xmath0 , the te@xmath13 mie gap completely splits from complicated coupled mie - bragg band becoming the lowest gap in the spectrum and the mm - phase appears . within this mie gap",
    "the magnetic permeability is negative and all waves in the medium are evanescent .",
    "since all the bragg gaps are located at higher frequencies , any diffraction losses in the vicinity of the mie resonance are absent . the transition from the phc phase to the mm phase",
    "is completed and the medium is classified as the mm with @xmath4 .",
    "a phase transition is usually characterized by an order parameter that basically arises from symmetry breaking but can also be defined for non - symmetry - breaking transitions @xcite . here for the unusual phase transition phc@xmath38 mm we define the order parameter @xmath39 as a measure of splitting in the energy scale between the te@xmath40 mie and bragg gaps .",
    "it is zero in the phc phase and nonzero in the mm phase .",
    "figure 5**b * * presents the order parameter depending on both external variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "now we review some features of the phc - mm phase diagram . at low filling ratio @xmath41 ,",
    "the concentration of the completely isolated rods in the lattice is too small for achieving negative average permeability at reasonable values of @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , when distance between rods become very small ( @xmath42 ) , the inter - rod interaction become strong and the hopping of the mie photons from one rod to another dominates .",
    "this means that mie resonances are not localized anymore and they finally exhibit the character of propagating bloch waves .",
    "all requirements for the appearance of the mm - phase are broken and the phc - phase extends its region of existence to very high @xmath1 .",
    "identification of candidate dielectric low - loss materials is critical in designing a practical mm for different ranges of electromagnetic spectrum . as an example , we plot in fig . 5**a * * the regions of the mm - phase for water in microwave range ( region @xmath43 ) @xcite , chalcogenide glasses in ir ( @xmath44 ) @xcite and tellurium in visible ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the 2d square lattice of silicon ( @xmath46 ) @xcite rods has only phc - phase .",
    "in this paper we integrate a 2d square structure composed of dielectric circular rods within a general phase diagram in the permittivity - filling ratio plane .",
    "the boundaries of the mm - phase were obtained theoretically and confirmed experimentally . based on the proposed approach",
    "one can obtain different phc - mm phase diagrams by altering the dimensions , symmetry , composition , size and geometry of structural elements within a cell .",
    "the underlying mechanism of the phc - mm transition provide unique criterion for goal - oriented search of novel low - loss mm with a wide range of applications at infrared and visible frequencies .",
