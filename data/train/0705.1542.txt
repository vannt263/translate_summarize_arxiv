    "spurious eigenvalues are unphysical , numerically - computed eigenvalues with large positive real parts that often occur in hydrodynamic stability problems .",
    "we propose that these unphysical eigenvalues occur when the incompressible navier stokes equations are analytically reduced ",
    "i.e. , the algebraic constraints are used to reduce the number of independent variables before the system is approximated using spectral methods .    an alternative approach to analyzing differential - algebraic equations is the _ descriptor _ framework , posed as a generalized eigenvalue problem , which explicitly retains the algebraic constraints during the numerical computation of eigenvalues .",
    "we reformulate two common hydrodynamic stability problems using descriptor notation and show that this method of computation avoids the spurious eigenvalues generated by other methods .",
    "the descriptor formulation is a simple , robust framework for eliminating spurious eigenvalues that occur in hydrodynamic stability analysis .",
    "additionally , this formulation reduces the order of the numerically approximated differential operators and accommodates complex boundary conditions(bcs ) , such as a fluid interacting with a flexible wall .",
    "resolving the spectrum of hydrodynamic operators is critical for time integration , linear stability  @xcite and transient growth analyses  @xcite of fluid flows .",
    "spurious eigenvalues often arise in these spectral numerical computations describing incompressible fluids and must be identified or eliminated .",
    "although the term `` spurious '' is applied to many numerical anomalies , it is used here to refer exclusively to large , positive eigenvalues that arise due to application of extra boundary conditions .",
    "these are distinct , for example , from spurious pressure modes that occur when the momentum equation is collocated at interior chebyshev - gauss - lobatto nodes  @xcite .",
    "researchers have developed special methods to avoid or filter these modes and uncover the true spectrum of the model problem .",
    "perhaps the first description of these unphysical values is given by gottlieb and orszag  @xcite .",
    "many other researchers have encountered similar modes  @xcite and developed methods for avoiding  @xcite or filtering  @xcite them . these methods for avoiding spurious modes are specific to very special _ clamped _ bcs where homogeneous dirichlet and neumann conditions hold at the boundaries .",
    "we emphasize that the descriptor method can be implemented using widely available numerical libraries and is easily generalized to non - clamped bcs .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : section  [ descriptor ] discusses the general descriptor framework and sections  [ orr1 ]  and  [ 1d ] develop this method for specific examples , the orr - sommerfeld operator and gottlieb and orszag s one - dimensional potential flow model  @xcite .",
    "section  [ discussion ] discusses how infinite eigenvalues arise in formulations of the incompressible fluid equations , and explains how the descriptor formulation explicitly accounts for these eigenvalues .",
    "we also discuss why methods that include analytical transformations might generate spurious eigenvalues , as well as benefits and drawbacks of descriptor formulations .",
    "descriptor notation can be used to describe any dynamical system where a set of differential - algebraic equations is reduced to a set of differential equations only . in this paper",
    "we focus on two models for incompressible fluid flow : the 2d navier - stokes equations which generate the orr - sommerfeld ( os ) operator , and gottlieb and orszag s 1d potential flow model .",
    "descriptor notation was developed in the control theory community  @xcite to describe and analyze systems of differential - algebraic equations . in descriptor form ,",
    "the differential time operator is preceded by a square , possibly singular matrix : @xmath0 in descriptor systems , stability is determined by the generalized eigenvalues of the ( @xmath1 ) system , which is the ratio of the pair @xmath2 where @xmath3 for some non - zero vector @xmath4 .",
    "while traditional eigenvalues are never infinite , descriptor system can have ( many ) infinite eigenvalues .",
    "if @xmath5 contains a zero row corresponding to an algebraic constraint , there will be an infinite eigenvalue corresponding to the infinitely fast dynamics of that constraint .",
    "let us assume that we have a system of differential - algebraic equations for @xmath6 fields .",
    "let there be @xmath7 algebraic constraints , and @xmath8 equations that contain a differential time operator .",
    "physical systems are often modeled by differential - algebraic equations of this form because algebraic constraints often arise as approximations to differential equations for quickly equilibrating variables .",
    "let the vector @xmath9 contain the @xmath10 fields that are acted upon by the differential time operator , and @xmath11 contain the remaining @xmath7 fields .",
    "each of the @xmath6 fields can be discretized using @xmath12 points for each field , which results in a finite - dimensional system of differential algebraic equations that can be written as follows :    @xmath13    the discretized operators @xmath14 and @xmath5 are square matrices with @xmath15 entries .",
    "if the original equations are partial differential equations , the operator @xmath14 contains spatial derivatives that require bcs .",
    "any bc can be incorporated into the numerical solution using boundary bordering in a straightforward manner  @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath14 contains spatial derivatives up to order @xmath16 for each of the @xmath10 fields in @xmath9 , then @xmath16 bcs are required for each field and are enforced by using ( @xmath17 ) rows of @xmath14 as additional algebraic constraints .",
    "we then solve for the generalized eigenvalues of the ( @xmath1 ) pair .",
    "we assume the pair is _ regular _ , which means that det@xmath18 is not identically zero for all  @xmath19 .",
    "there are many numerical routines that solve for the generalized eigenvalues of regular matrix pairs when one of the matrices is singular ( see references in  @xciteand  @xcite ) .",
    "a widely available routine is the matlab ( lapack ) *qz* algorithm  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath5 contains ( @xmath20 ) zero rows corresponding to the original algebraic constraints and ( @xmath21 ) zero rows corresponding to the boundary bordering constraints , resulting in an ( @xmath1 ) pair with @xmath22 infinite generalized eigenvalues and @xmath23 finite eigenvalues .",
    "although the algebraic constraints are approximated using boundary bordering , descriptor notation ensures that the generalized eigenvalues corresponding to these constraints are not approximated  they are formally infinite .",
    "our method is in contrast to other methods where the algebraic constraints are removed analytically . in these methods ,",
    "the system is analytically converted to a system of equations that contains only fields in @xmath24 , and consequently , a subset of the algebraic constraints on @xmath11 are converted to additional bcs on @xmath24 .",
    "discretization and enforcement of the new bcs may lead to an approximate enforcement of the original algebraic constraints , resulting in spurious eigenvalues .",
    "one example of this over - specification of the bcs occurs in the derivation of the os operator .",
    "assume that @xmath25 contains a first order spatial derivative and @xmath26 is zero .",
    "we eliminate @xmath11 , using a method described for the os operator in appendix  [ orr_som_app ]  ( eqs .",
    "[ rigidorig]-[orrend ] ) , and the resulting system of equations contains a spatial derivative of order @xmath27 acting on the fields in @xmath9 .",
    "because the derivative operator is two orders higher than before , the system requires two new bcs .",
    "these extra bcs are determined by numerically approximating the algebraic constraints at the boundary .",
    "however , the algebraic constraints were used to eliminate @xmath11 and were already evaluated at the boundary in the analytical computation . in several spectral methods ,",
    "the algebraic constraints at the boundary are enforced twice , with slightly different numerical approximations in each case .",
    "we now illustrate how the descriptor method avoids this over - specification in two example problems .",
    "the navier - stokes equations for a compressible , viscous fluid can be written  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the three components of the velocity , @xmath11 is the fluid pressure , @xmath30 is the the mass density , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the first and second kinematic viscosities , respectively . an additional thermodynamic constraint such as constant",
    "entropy relates the variables @xmath33 and @xmath11 and closes the system of equations .",
    "as the system approaches the incompressible limit , the partial differential equation expressing conservation of mass ( eq .  [ mass_cons ] ) becomes increasingly stiff , and in the limit a differential equation in time is replaced by an algebraic constraint , @xmath34 as the equation for the mass density  [ mass_cons ] becomes more stiff the eigenvalues of the operator will have larger real parts , and in the limit the eigenvalues will be infinite . in this case the pressure can be thought of as a lagrange multiplier that instantaneously satisfies the divergence constraint and no thermodynamic equation is required to relate the pressure and density .",
    "therefore eqs .",
    "( [ mom_cons ] ,  [ div_const ] ) alone are the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible fluid .",
    "numerical solutions to the linearized , incompressible equations of motion have traditionally been determined by combining the laplacian and divergence of the ns equations .",
    "this allows the pressure to be rewritten in terms of the fluid velocities , thereby reducing the set of four differential algebraic equations to two differential equations . for later reference , these equations are derived using operator multiplication in appendix  [ orr_som_app ] . in planar channel flow",
    "this results in the os equation for the wall - normal velocity and the squire equation for the wall - normal vorticity  @xcite .",
    "descriptor notation does not require this reduction , and does not generate the fourth order os operator .    in most two - dimensional flow models",
    "the system is assumed to be translation invariant in the spanwise(@xmath35 ) direction , so the coupling between the vorticity and velocity is zero and eigenvalues of the os operator determine the system stability . in order to compare our results with previous studies , we focus here on the stability of the os operator alone .",
    "the os operator contains the term @xmath36 , which is a fourth - order spatial derivative in the wall - normal direction and requires four bcs .",
    "two bcs are simply the no - slip conditions from the original equations , @xmath37 .",
    "the remaining two bcs arise from the divergence constraint : @xmath38 where the last equality holds because @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constant ( zero ) in the streamwise ( @xmath41)- and spanwise(@xmath35)- directions at the boundary .",
    "therefore , homogeneous neumann bc on the wall - normal velocity is a direct consequence of the incompressible limit .",
    "this has important implications for numerical approximations , as well will discuss in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "spurious eigenvalues arise frequently in the analysis of this os operator  @xcite . while there are several methods for avoiding or filtering these eigenvalues , such as applying only dirichlet conditions to the second order operator  @xcite , they are tailored to clamped boundary conditions and are not easily generalizable .",
    "our approach to solving the original system of eqs .",
    "( [ mom_cons ] ,  [ div_const ] ) is more general .",
    "we avoid combining the two equations into a single system and instead write the system using descriptor notation .",
    "a similar analysis using descriptor notation was applied previously to incompressible stokes flow in the context of systems control  @xcite , which we generalize to eliminate spurious eigenvalues",
    ". the ns equations  ( [ mom_cons ] ,  [ div_const ] ) can be written : @xmath42 the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined in appendix  [ orr_som_app ] .    in hydrodynamic channel flow , a fourier transform can be taken in the translation invariant streamwise and spanwise directions .",
    "the velocities have dirichlet bcs at the channel boundaries , @xmath45 , and we discretize the system of equations in the wall normal direction using chebyshev collocation or other spectral methods .",
    "no - slip bcs are enforced for the velocities , but care must be taken to ensure that no bcs are applied to the pressure .    for simplicity ,",
    "boundary bordering is used to enforce dirichlet bcs on each component of the velocity .",
    "we approximate each component of the velocity and the pressure by a vector of @xmath12 points .",
    "the bcs require that the first and last entry of each velocity vector is zero : @xmath46 this is equivalent to deleting the first and last columns of @xmath47 and @xmath48 that occur in the operators @xmath44 and @xmath14 , respectively , in eq .",
    "[ des_orr ] . additionally , time derivatives of the velocity evaluated at the boundary are zero @xmath49 , which is equivalent to deleting the corresponding rows of @xmath14 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "[ des_orr ] . as a result",
    ", each component of the velocity is represented by an @xmath51 column vector .",
    "let @xmath52 .",
    "then the operator @xmath14 is approximated by an @xmath53-by-@xmath53 matrix , @xmath50 is a matrix that is @xmath53 rows by @xmath12 columns , @xmath44 is @xmath12 rows by @xmath53 columns .",
    "note that there are no bcs imposed on @xmath11 , which is still a vector of size @xmath12 .",
    "we then solve for the generalized eigenvalues of the ( @xmath54 ) pair using the matlab ( lapack ) *qz* algorithm  @xcite . in the parameter range",

    "it ensures that infinitely fast modes will retain formally infinite eigenvalues , even when those eigenvalues are computed numerically .",
    "in incompressible fluid flows , there are @xmath12 discretized pressure variables which correspond to @xmath12 generalized eigenvalues which are explicitly infinite .",
    "this method enforces only the no - slip bcs and applies them in an intuitive and unambiguous way .",
    "while other methods reduce the number of fields ( from four to two in the orr - sommerfeld formulation ) , they do so at the expense of creating higher order derivative operators , which decreases resolution for a fixed number of grid points or basis functions . in addition , the descriptor formulation does not require inversion of a differential operator , is adaptable to different discretization schemes , and can be simply extended to problems where bcs are non - trivial .",
    "the descriptor framework and the traditional orr - sommerfeld method with modified clamped boundary conditions are complementary schemes .",
    "the latter is likely to be useful for problems with homogeneous boundary conditions where the number of discretization points is very large .",
    "the former is more flexible : it is useful when higher order operators are undesirable , inhomogeneous boundary conditions are required , or direct calculations for the pressure ( or any lagrange multiplier in a general dae ) are desired .",

    "these complicated dirichlet bcs can be applied directly to the second order differential operators in @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the fluid pressure at the boundary remains as an independent variable in the eigenvalue computation , which is advantageous because the pressure at the boundary influences wall motion .",
    "this topic is currently under investigation .",
    "utilizing descriptor notation is similar in spirit to several other methods for avoiding spurious eigenvalues which require the algebraic constraints to be discretized separately from the differential equations  @xcite .",
    "gottlieb s method utilizes a _ shooting _",
    "algorithm for determining eigenvalues ",
    "his algorithm was developed before efficient matrix methods were available for solving generalized eigenvalue problems with singular matrices .",
    "gardner and boyd also describe methods where the algebraic constraint is discretized .",
