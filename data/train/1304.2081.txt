    "a complete experimental verification of the standard model ( sm ) , including the discovery of the higgs boson and precision tests of its properties , is the most intriguing and challenging task of high energy particle physics at the moment .",
    "last year , the major lhc collaborations , atlas and cms @xcite , have announced the discovery of a new `` higgs - like '' particle with the mass of @xmath6 gev , which may become the last yet missing piece predicted within the sm framework  the higgs boson .",
    "some evidence for the higgs boson has been also seen by cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "an ultimate proof of the higgs boson s existence and understanding of its nature would only be possible after high precision measurements of its decay parameters which can be sensitive to details of a particular new physics scenario .",
    "the current situation with the higgs boson properties suggests that there are no significant deviations from the sm ( within rather large statistical and systematical uncertainties ) as revealed by the full data set collected so far at the lhc @xcite and tevatron @xcite ( for the most recent comprehensive studies of the higgs boson properties , see e.g. refs .",
    "even though the room for new physics contributions has been greatly reduced @xcite , it is too early to draw final conclusions about the properties and nature of the newly discovered particle not only due to large experimental error bars , but also due to theoretical uncertainties in the sm higgs production which are rather high and become dominant @xcite .",
    "if the branching ratios deviate from predictions of the simplest one - doublet sm , even slightly , this would require a proper extension of the sm and pose a serious question about theoretical principles such an extension should be based upon .",
    "traditionally , ideas of additional to sm strongly - coupled sectors in confinement were realized in the technicolor ( tc ) model which was one of the strongest alternatives to the higgs mechanism of the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite .",
    "the existing higgs - less tc models with dynamical ewsb ( dewsb ) are based upon the idea that the goldstone degrees of freedom ( technipions ) appearing after the global chiral symmetry breaking @xmath7 are absorbed by the sm weak gauge bosons which thereby gain masses .",
    "the dewsb mechanism is then triggered by the condensate of technifermions in confinement , @xmath8 .",
    "traditional tc models with dewsb are faced with the problem of the mass generation of standard fermions , which was consistently resolved in extended tc scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , many of the existing tc models have got severely constrained or even ruled out by the ew precision data @xcite ( for a detailed review on the existing tc models , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . generally , in these schemes noticeable contributions to strongly constrained flavor",
    "changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes appear together with too large contributions to peskin - takeuchi ( especially , to @xmath9 ) parameters .",
    "further developments of the tc ideas have resulted in the walking tc model which succeeded in resolving the above - mentioned problems and remains a viable model of the dewsb @xcite .    very recently , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the latest lhc data , the @xmath10 allowed region of the relative to sm - predicted higgs - vector - vector fusion @xmath11 coupling is @xmath12 , which sets further constraints on the ewsb models alternative to the sm higgs mechanism , as well as to composite higgs models ( see also current bounds on the rescaling of the sm couplings in ref .",
    "however , even if the newly - discovered particle is indeed the sm higgs boson and the higgs mechanism is experimentally confirmed , all available lhc and high precision ew data do not completely exclude the existence of a strongly - coupled fermion sector in confinement , additional to the sm fermion sector , with a confinement scale , @xmath13 tev , being not very far from the ew scale @xmath14 gev .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove this statement and to study a new class of viable realistic models for an extra strongly - coupled sector assisting the conventional sm higgs mechanism at accessible energy scales , along with the study of their implications to the ongoing new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "an alternative class of tc models usually referred to as bosonic tc scenarios include both a higgs doublet @xmath15 and a new tc sector @xcite , without referring to an origin of the higgs doublet .",
    "most recent realization of the bosonic tc is based upon holographic ideas @xcite , and allows to explain the existence of recently discovered higgs - like 125 gev particle and its possible non - standard features @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "strongly coupled dynamics is defined using the ads / cft correspondence within the holographic approach allowing to avoid the ew precision constraints @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional ( extended and walking ) tc models , in bosonic tc models the mechanism of the ewsb and generation of sm fermions masses is driven by the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) in the standard way , irrespectively of ( elementary or composite ) nature of the higgs field itself .",
    "due to linear source term in the higgs potential the higgs field @xmath15 develops vev which in turn is induced by the technifermion condensate .",
    "this means the higgs mechanism is not the primary source of the ewsb , but effectively induced by an unknown tc dynamics at high scales . for more alternatives on tc and compositeness models ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we start off with the similar ideas about the existence of an extra higgs - like scalar field and tc nature of the sm higgs vev implemented in the bosonic tc models and study theoretical and phenomenological opportunities of new possible strongly coupled sectors with chiral - symmetric ( vector - like ) gauge interactions .",
    "we further develop these ideas based on the gauged linear @xmath0-model @xcite and applied it to new tc - induced degrees of freedom , in a complete analogy with low - energy hadron physics applications . in this model ,",
    "which will further be referred to as the chiral - symmetric ( or vector - like ) technicolor ( in short , cstc ) scenario , the oblique ( peskin - takeuchi ) parameters and fcnc corrections turn out to be naturally very small and fully consistent with the current ew constraints as well as with the most recent higgs couplings measurements at the lhc in the limit of small higgs - technisigma mixing .",
    "most importantly , this happens naturally in the standard quantum - field theory framework implemented in rigorous quark - meson approaches of hadron physics without attracting any extra holographic or other special arguments from unknown high - scale physics . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the simplest version of the standard model with one higgs doublet , and the question whether it is elementary or composite is not critical for further considerations .",
    "the new heavy physical states of the model ( additional to those in the sm ) are the singlet technisigma @xmath16 , triplet of technipions @xmath17 , and constituent technifermions @xmath18 which acquire masses via the technifermion condensate as an external source and the technisigma vev ( other composite degrees of freedom are usually much heavier and decoupled from the considering low - energy limit of the theory ) .",
    "their possible phenomenological implications and signatures at the lhc is the subject of our analysis .    despite the phenomenological advantages mentioned above , the proposed cstc scenario , at least , in its simplest form considered here , does not attempt to resolve the naturalness problem of the sm , i.e. does not provide a mechanism protecting the higgs boson",
    "mass itself from becoming arbitrary large . nevertheless , it points out a promising path towards a consistent formulation of composite higgs models in extended chiral - gauge theories with vector - like uv completion which leads to an unambiguous determination of the higgs vev in terms of the technifermion condensate .",
    "the latter means that the ew symmetry is broken dynamically via the effective higgs mechanism in this limit , which makes it particularly interesting .",
    "this statement is stable w.r.t .",
    "radiative corrections . ] . indeed , an existence of composite higgs - like bosons is often considered as a primary guideline for technicolor models . in analogy with hadron physics",
    ", composite bosons can be of two different types : _ pseudo - goldstone collective excitations _",
    "( quantum wave of correlations between non - perturbative technifermion fluctuations in technivacuum ) and _ techniquarkonia _ ( a `` bubble '' of technivacuum stabilized by valence technifermions ) .",
    "after lhc experiments , the technicolor models with composite sm - like higgs bosons have become favorable .",
    "the latter means that the sm - like higgs mechanism is indeed realized in nature even though it can be treated as an effective one , i.e. the initial fields of collective excitations or techniquarkonia should be in the fundamental representation of the ew gauge group with hypercharge @xmath19 . in the cstc model",
    "such objects naturally appear if one extends the technifermion sector .",
    "the simplest extension is such that in addition to the ew doublet of technifermions @xmath20 one introduces an extra weak - singlet technifermion @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , a new composite scalar field appears @xmath21 having transformation properties of the higgs boson ( @xmath22 doublet with @xmath19 ) . in this model ,",
    "the initial classification ( techniflavor ) group is the global chiral group @xmath23 .",
    "a further generalization would be to consider @xmath24 giving rise to effective two higgs - doublet model .",
    "of course , in such extended techniflavor models there appears a plenty of new technihadron states which require a separate lengthy analysis . in analogy",
    "to hadron physics one may expect , however , that the lightest physical technihadron states which are the most interesting for the lhc phenomenology in the first place are technipions , technisigma and , in principle , lightest technibaryons . therefore , in this paper we limit ourselves to considering initial ( presumably , the _ minimal _ ) techniflavor group @xmath25 and discuss a simplified model with gauged vector - like subgroup @xmath26 only where the higgs boson formally ( at the low - energy part of the spectrum of technihadrons ) has a status of the fundamental field , which does not satisfy the naturalness criterium .",
    "an extended techniflavor model @xmath27 with @xmath28 will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section ii is devoted to description of theoretical foundations of the cstc scenario along with the physical lagrangian derivation and analysis of the parameter space .",
    "the study of ew constraints ( oblique corrections and fcnc ) is performed in section iii .",
    "some basic opportunities for lhc phenomenology , in particular , in studies of the higgs sector properties , as well as in searches for new lightest composites , are discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , section v summarizes the basic results of the paper .",
    "historically , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite based on the global chiral group @xmath29 is the first model describing dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in particles physics ( for review on the topic , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a large interest in the gauged version of the njl model ( or gnjl ) initially proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite has been stimulated by its importance for constructing extended tc models and top - quark condensate models ( for an extensive review of the gnjl models and their applications , see ref .",
    "the gnjl approach has fewer parameters and significantly reduces ambiguities of corresponding predictions .    as one of the most successful implementation of the gnjl ideas in hadron physics , the so - called gauged linear @xmath0-model ( gl@xmath0 m ) initially proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and further elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite was one of the first models with local chiral @xmath30 symmetry , which incorporates the vector @xmath31 and pseudovector @xmath32 mesons as corresponding gauge bosons , besides lightest pseudoscalar pion @xmath33 and scalar @xmath0 fields .",
    "typically , the local chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the scalar @xmath0 vev giving rise to the vector - meson mass terms , constituent light quark masses @xcite and the mass splitting between @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons .    in what follows ,",
    "we employ the ideas of the gl@xmath0 m and consider the _",
    "chiral @xmath29 group in the technifermion sector @xmath18 in the simplest case with @xmath34 , with its subsequent breaking ( by the technisigma vev ) down to the vector subgroup @xmath35 which is then _ gauged _ at energy scales close to the ewsb scale .",
    "such a `` gauging '' , however , does not necessarily mean that one should introduce extra gauge bosons to the existing theory .",
    "the `` gauging '' procedure may also mean that corresponding fundamental technifermions interact with _ already existing _ gauge bosons in the sm in the low - energy effective field theory limit , which is a rather plausible opportunity we wish to explore here",
    ". in analogy with standard qcd and hadron physics , at the scale of the order of the techniconfinement scale @xmath36 technifermions acquire effective non - perturbative constituent masses due to the chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . at lower energies",
    "the initial technifermions condense into technihadron states due to confinement .",
    "this scheme is an analogy of the chiral - invariant qhd - iii model @xcite where the pseudo - goldstone technipion fields @xmath37 get the same masses ( via an external source term linear in @xmath16 field ) and remain the physical degrees of freedom , in distinction from many other traditional tc and compositeness scenarios .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider a possible scenario of the sm extension by means of an additional chiral - symmetric ( vector - like ) technifermion sector confined under @xmath38 group , which is analogical to the @xmath39 color group of qcd .",
    "such an assignment is not unique , of course , but would allow us to use direct analogies with hadron physics group with many appealing features @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "one of the exceptional groups , say , @xmath40 can exist in confinement and , possibly , consists of a few unbroken subgroups confined at different scales , whereas the second @xmath41 gets broken down to the sm gauge group @xmath42 in a straightforward way . as a realistic possibility ,",
    "one of the @xmath43 subgroups of the original @xmath40 can be , in principle , identified with the tc gauge group @xmath38 , which acts only on new additional technifermion sector , and there are no any obstacles for it to be confined at relatively low scales being not very far from the ewsb scale ( later it will be shown that the latter condition is not critical for the tc - induced ewsb ) .",
    "the gl@xmath0 m can therefore be efficiently extended to incorporate constituent technifermion - technimeson interactions as the simplest way of phenomenological description of the non - perturbative effects in technihadron dynamics at low energies",
    ". we will further refer to it below as the gauged linear technisigma model , or glt@xmath0 m . in the simplest version of this model ,",
    "the non - perturbative effects are accounted for by an effective njl - type theory of constituent technifermion interactions with the lightest technihadron states only @xcite  technipions and technisigma . in the context of glt@xmath0 m",
    "we suggest the following hypothesis , which will be studied below : _ the energy scales of the ewsb and techni - confinement have a common quantum - topological nature and are determined by a non - perturbative dynamics of the technifermion - technigluon condensate_. in particular , we would like to find specific conditions on the model parameters under which the latter hypothesis is validated . as was noted above , the technipion d.o.f .",
    "@xmath37 are the pseudo - goldstone fields which are usually considered as collective fluctuations of the technifermion - technigluon vacuum , while technisigma @xmath16 is the lightest techniglueball state ",
    "these states are not usual bound @xmath44 states and thus play a special role in the glt@xmath0 m @xcite .    from the point of view of the glt@xmath0 m",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of the _ global _ chiral symmetry group in the technifermion sector happens in the chiral - symmetric ( vector - like ) way in a complete analogy with the chiral symmetry breaking in gnjl models @xcite as follows @xmath45 where the subsequent _ gauging _ of the resulting unbroken vector subgroup @xmath46 and its identification with the weak gauge group of the sm are performed .",
    "such gauging and identification procedures are not forbidden theoretically and lead to specific properties of the technifermion sector , which thereby make it to be very different from the chiral - nonsymmetric sm fermion sectors .",
    "it therefore means that after the chiral symmetry breaking in the technifermion sector the left and right components of the original dirac technifermion fields can interact with the sm weak @xmath47 gauge bosons with vector - like couplings , in opposition to ordinary sm fermions , which interact under @xmath22 by means of their left - handed components only .",
    "note , analogous vector - like gauge interactions are rather common and appear e.g. in the chargino sector of the mssm .",
    "note , the above procedure ( [ ident ] ) should be understood in exactly the same way as is done in the qcd hadron physics at low energies .",
    "there , the fundamental gauge group of color @xmath39 is vector - like i.e. acts on left - handed @xmath48 and right - handed @xmath49 quarks in exactly the same way , which makes it possible to introduce the global chiral group @xmath50 .",
    "the latter is typically broken down to the vector - like subgroup @xmath51 by the @xmath0-vev .",
    "if one gauges it , one recovers that its properties are _ identical _ to the color group @xmath39 in the low energy limit .",
    "this leads to a low - energy effective field theory where interaction properties of elementary and composite fields are effectively described by the same gauge group with renormalized local gauge couplings ( as limiting values of corresponding form factors valid at small momentum transfers ) .",
    "similarly , vector - like weak interactions of technifermions make it possible to introduce the chiral group whose gauged subgroup has properties identical to the weak isospin group ( [ ident ] ) .",
    "most importantly , the latter procedure is valid _ only _ in the phenomenologically interesting low energy limit of the theory .",
    "when typical momentum transfers become comparable to the techniconfinement scale or larger @xmath52 the global chiral symmetry is fully restored , while fundamental ew gauge interactions of technifermions remain vector - like ( similarly to qcd interactions of quarks in perturbative limit ) .",
    "so , in this scenario the sector of initial ( current ) technifermions transforms according to the local gauge @xmath53 symmetry group , and , therefore , interacts only with sm gauge bosons @xmath54 , or with @xmath55 and @xmath56 after the sm symmetry breaking . of course , in a complete local chiral @xmath57 theory of technifermion - technimeson - gauge interactions one would need to include e.g. a mixing of vector technirho @xmath58 with the elementary sm gauge bosons as is done in local quark - meson interaction theories @xcite ( for review on the subject , see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in this work in what follows we neglect the heavier vector and pseudovector technimesons , such that only elementary gauge @xmath54 fields remain , and consider only the spectrum of lightest composite scalar ( technisigma @xmath16 ) and pseudoscalar ( technipion @xmath37 ) states , relevant for the lhc measurements . note ,",
    "that a reduction scheme to the left - right ( lr ) symmetric subgroup @xmath26 enables one to introduce current masses of technifermions directly into the initial lagrangian without a need in extra fields which is considered to be advantageous . while the latter freedom may be regarded as a new form of the hierarchy problem as there must be a symmetry which protects the current up ( @xmath59 ) and down ( @xmath60 ) technifermion masses @xmath61 from becoming very large , we take on the phenomenological approach and consider the chiral limit of the theory with the current masses being small compared to the techniconfinement energy scale , i.e. @xmath62 , in a complete analogy with the chiral qcd framework .",
    "surely , the latter issue should be addressed in a high - scale gut - like theory which incorporates new strongly - coupled fermion sectors , and this certainly goes beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "additionally , chiral ( axial ) anomalies do not appear in this framework ; it is _ anomaly - safe _ automatically .",
    "we will further discuss specific consequences of such new vector - like weak interactions of the additional technifermion sector in confinement .",
    "one should remember that identification of the local vector subgroup of the chiral group with the sm weak isospin group ( [ ident ] ) is a purely phenomenological procedure which leads to correct results in the low energy limit of the theory .",
    "in reality , of course , the global classification techniflavor group @xmath63 has nothing to do with the ew gauge group of the sm .",
    "at the first stage , the techniflavor group is used for classification of _ composite _ technihadrons and , in particular , predicts the existence of technipions , technisigma and technibaryons states . at the second stage ,",
    "one notices that technifermions entering the composite technihadrons besides technistrong interactions participate also in the fundamental ew interactions .",
    "one should therefore calculate the _ ew form factors _ of composite technihadrons .",
    "the corresponding ew interactions must then be also introduced at _ the fundamental technifermion level _ consistently with those at _",
    "the composite level technihadron level_. at the third stage , in the phenomenologically interesting low - energy limit of the theory the ew form factors approach the renormalized ew constants ( since the technihadron substructure does not emerge at relatively small momentum transfers ) .",
    "the latter should be calculated after _ reclassification _ of technihadrons under the ew group representations .",
    "this three - fold generic scheme will be used below for description of ew interactions of technihadrons .    according to the standard quark - meson approaches @xcite ,",
    "constituent quark loops describe non - perturbative effects at relatively small distances , whereas meson loops work at larger distances .",
    "this scheme should be realized in the cstc model under discussion , in a complete analogy with the standard quark - meson theories , and is valid up to an energy scale of typical technihadron states .",
    "following to this analogy , we consider meson ( technipions @xmath37 and technisigma @xmath16 ) interactions at tree level , and technifermion interactions ( with effective constituent masses ) at one - loop level @xcite . at much larger energies",
    ", one should turn into the perturbative techni - qcd framework describing technigluon and technifermion ( with current masses ) interactions , in analogy with the standard qcd approach .",
    "this scenario becomes especially interesting from both theoretical and phenomenological points of view since it predicts the existence of the physical technimeson spectrum with relatively light pseudoscalar @xmath37 and scalar @xmath16 fields is not very far above the ew scale , technibaryon states might emerge in lhc data as large missing @xmath64 signatures which is a subject for further studies . ] .",
    "latter has quantum numbers identical to the sm higgs boson ones .",
    "this leads to a mixing of initial @xmath16 and @xmath15 fields causing a possible modification of the physical higgs boson couplings .",
    "additionally , lightest physical technipion states @xmath37 enrich lhc phenomenology with possible new observable signatures , to be studied in detail .",
    "as was shortly discussed in the previous section , we use the standard structure of the gauged linear @xmath0-model for low - energy tc phenomenology .",
    "let us formulate the cstc model in terms of the lightest composite states based on the local weak isospin symmetry group @xmath65 acting on the confined technifermion sector .",
    "the initial field content of the cstc model in its simplest formulation is given by one @xmath66-symmetric doublet of technifermions @xmath67 which forms the fundamental representation of the @xmath68 group , the initial scalar technisigma @xmath9 field which is the singlet representation , and the triplet of initial technipion fields @xmath69 which is the adjoint ( vector ) representation of @xmath22 ( with zeroth @xmath70 hypercharge ) .",
    "thus , in terms of the fields introduced above the glt@xmath0 m part of the lagrangian responsible for yukawa - type interactions of the technifermions reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the pauli matrices . by restricting ourselves to considering only one technifermion doublet ( [ tdoub ] ) ( the first generation ) ,",
    "we imply that other generations , if exist , are much heavier and split off in the mass spectrum , based on analogy with the sm , even though such an analogy is not mandatory .    in the sm ,",
    "the gauge boson interactions with usual hadrons are typically introduced by means of hadronisation effects ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig-1 ] ( left ) ) .        in our case ,",
    "such an effect is strongly suppressed by large constituent masses of technifermions @xmath73 . instead",
    ", the interactions of @xmath18 and @xmath74 fields with initial sm gauge fields @xmath75 can be introduced via the local approximation which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig-1 ] ( right ) . generally speaking",
    ", these interactions should be written in terms of nonlocal form factors since both technimesons and dressed ( constituent ) technifermions are the objects delocalized at energy scales exceeding the scale of non - perturbative technigluon fluctuations .",
    "we assume , however , that the latter scale is large compared to the ewsb scale and corresponding effects can be neglected at experimentally accessible energy scales .",
    "thus , in the first approximation one can replace the form factors by point - like couplings as is usually done in the local quantum - field theory approach .",
    "the coupling constants of @xmath18 and @xmath74 with gauge fields can be taken the same as in the sm , but calculated via the renormalisation group evolution at corresponding scales . since this evolution is logarithmic and rather weak , whereas @xmath36 is assumed to be in a vicinity of the ew scale , in the leading - order numerical analysis below we fix all the relevant couplings at the @xmath76 scale .",
    "the vector - like gauge interactions can be introduced via covariant derivatives over the local @xmath77 group in the same form as the sm gauge interactions , i.e. the additional ( to the sm ) kinetic terms have the following form @xmath78 where the covariant derivatives of the @xmath18 and @xmath74 fields reads @xmath79 respectively .",
    "further , we wish to employ analogies with the sm and , in particular , with qcd as much as possible , so for the sake of convenience and simplicity in actual calculations we fix the hypercharge of the technifermion doublet ( [ tdoub ] ) to be the same as that of the quark doublet in the sm , i.e. @xmath80 , unless noted otherwise . certainly , the hypercharge @xmath81 , the number of technifermion generations , the respective properties of interactions , etc . should be ultimately constrained in extended chiral - gauge or grand - unified theories incorporating extra technifermion sectors , which is a subject of further studies .    in eqs .",
    "( [ lg ] ) and ( [ dq ] ) we notice two key differences of the cstc scenario from traditional tc - based models ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite )  the existence of physical technisigma and technipion states , introduced via the glt@xmath0 m approach , and the equivalence of left and right technifermion chiralities in their interactions with weak gauge bosons , following from the gauging of the initial chiral group of the linear @xmath0 model . along with the absence of chiral anomalies ,",
    "the cstc scenario under discussion can be considered as a solid theoretically motivated basis for the whole new class of more elaborated tc - based extensions of the sm and their phenomenological tests .",
    "next , let us consider the potential part of the cstc model lagrangian giving rise to ( pseudo)scalar self - interactions and @xmath82 , @xmath16 masses after the chiral symmetry breaking and the ewsb .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , in the simplest formulation of the cstc model developed in this work we keep the sm higgs mechanism of the ewsb and the one - higgs - doublet sm untouched , and simply add extra technifermion sector ( [ tdoub ] ) in confinement . as an essential part of the cstc model , we introduce the interaction terms between the standard higgs doublet @xmath83 , and the new @xmath74 and @xmath9 states which are allowed by the local @xmath84 symmetry . as will be demonstrated below , such extra terms lead to a mixing between the scalar higgs and technisigma fields .",
    "the most general form of the lagrangian corresponding to the scalar self - interactions including @xmath85-terms as follows @xcite @xmath86 and the extra linear `` source '' term which appears after averaging over the technifermion vacuum fluctuations and describes interactions of the scalar singlet @xmath9 field with scalar modes of the technifermion condensate , i.e. @xmath87 the potential part of the glt@xmath0 m lagrangian is then given by @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ l - u - self ] ) we defined @xmath89 , whereas gauge - higgs interaction terms are the same as in the sm .",
    "the mixing between the higgs boson and scalar technisigma fields is governed by the quartic higgs - tc coupling @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ l - u - self ] ) .",
    "such a mixing is one of the characteristic effects of the chiral - symmetric technicolor . in a sense",
    ", this effect is indeed one of the motivations of the model under discussion .",
    "it has to be taken into consideration if the precision lhc measurements uncover possibly small deviations of the higgs - like @xmath91 gev boson ( especially , in the @xmath3 decay channel ) from the standard higgs boson .",
    "the quartic coupling @xmath90 controls such a mixing and  priori is allowed by the gauge symmetry of the initial lagrangian , thus , can not be identically equal to zero . indeed ,",
    "any terms which are allowable by the initial symmetry of the model , even being equal to zero at the tree level , necessarily appear in divergent radiative corrections . in order to renormalize such divergencies",
    "one has to introduce corresponding counterterms .",
    "so if at a given scale @xmath92 the coupling @xmath93 vanishes it will reappear at another scale .",
    "in particular , before the spontaneous ew symmetry breaking the operator @xmath94 is supported by the two - loop box - box diagram illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : operators ] ( left ) with incoming initial @xmath9 and @xmath74 fields and outgoing initial higgs field @xmath95 .",
    "this operator thus contributes to remormalization of @xmath90 coupling .",

    "thus , both @xmath9 and @xmath59 parameters can not be used for an efficient constraining the model parameter space at the current level of data uncertainties ( [ stu - constr ] ) .",
    "the same holds true for associated oblique corrections beyond the linear @xmath298 power expansions , given in terms of @xmath287 parameters ( [ vwx ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath362 and @xmath103 parameters remain of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath9 and @xmath59 parameters .",
    "they belong to the interval @xmath363 and are weakly dependent on physical parameters ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig - pt - x ] ) . in general",
    ", this situation is not noticeably affected by having more than one generation of technifermions or other @xmath366 different from three .",
    "the strongest bounds to the cstc parameter space actually come from the @xmath339 parameter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig - pt - t ] ) .",
    "the ew precision constraints to the @xmath339 parameter encoding the vector isospin breaking effects ( [ stu - constr ] ) are satisfied only for a relatively small @xmath127 mixing @xmath367 and a small splitting between current technifermion masses @xmath368 gev .",
    "the latter is natural since similarly the relatively small splitting between the current up and down quark masses compared to their constituent masses applies also for usual qcd . in the degenerated case with @xmath350 and in the `` no @xmath276-mixing '' limit @xmath369 , the @xmath339-parameter vanishes identically , @xmath370 .",
    "so , the cstc model has enough room to fit with the ew precision data , together with tight constraints to the higgs sector properties .",
    "note , the @xmath371 parameters are always uv finite .",
    "the @xmath339 parameter is finite in the degenerated case when @xmath372 , whereas in general case it has logarithmic divergence proportional to the technifermion mass difference , i.e. @xmath373 with a constant coefficient .",
    "note also that the ew constraints put much stronger limits on parameter space in the case of inverse mass hierarchy in the scalar sector of the theory , i.e. assuming that technisigma is the lightest scalar particle observed at the lhc @xmath141 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath127-mixing angle has to be much closer to being vanished in order to satisfy the constraints on the corresponding oblique corrections .",
    "another source of ( less ) stringent constraints onto tc models comes from the fcnc - induced processes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "in particular , here one would be interested in constraints coming from such processes as mixing in system of neutral mesons @xmath374 , as well as from rare leptonic decays of neutral mesons @xmath375 , etc .",
    "the semi - leptonic decays are presumably more uncertain theoretically due to larger contributions from poorly known hadronic form factors thus making it rather hard to set definite constraints to np contributions .",
    "the flavor constraints can be very relevant for phenomenological tests of the tc models with relatively light spin-1 resonances with the same quantum numbers as the sm gauge bosons . in the considering cstc model under discussion adopting the qcd - like mass hierarchy in the technihadron spectrum",
    "there are no light spin-1 particles ; heavy vector @xmath58 and axial - vector @xmath376 states are considered to be decoupled from the lightest technipion and technisigma states and do not participate in processes at low momentum transfers .",
    "this is , of course , a valid approximation motivated by advances of the usual hadron physics . an extended theory which supposedly includes heavy states",
    "should then be quantitatively tested against the flavor constraints according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , setting up the low bounds on masses of heavy ( pseudo)vector particles .",
    "however , this analysis will only be reasonable after the lightest ( pseudo)scalar states have been discovered experimentally .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcnc ] we illustrate new contributions ( besides those in the gauge bosons polarisations ) to typical fcnc processes ( rightmost diagrams ) , along with the standard part ( first two diagrams on the left hand side ) .",
    "these diagrams describe the short - distance contributions , which dominate the fcnc observables for heavy flavor mesons ( for instance , @xmath377 ) . in the framework of the cstc model ,",
    "an additional effect comes only from the @xmath127-mixing , whereas technipions and technifermions can only contribute to the gauge bosons polarisation functions inside the loop propagators .",
    "the qualitative analysis of these contributions reveals that these contributions are strongly suppressed due to the following arguments :    * the typical contributions from two - loop fcnc effects with the higgs boson in the @xmath378-channel in neutral mesons @xmath374 mixing is extremely small , and usually neglected in the sm calculations .",
    "an additional ( small ) mixing with the heavy @xmath16 field can not change this situation noticeably ; * in the case of rare ( semi)leptonic decays of the higgs boson , as well as @xmath16 meson , yukawa couplings to leptons are usually very small ( @xmath379 ) , and the corresponding contributions are also neglected ; * in all cases the @xmath16 contributions are additionally suppressed by a large technisigma mass compared to vector boson masses , @xmath380 ; * an extra ( double ) suppression in the limit of small @xmath127-mixing by @xmath381 factor in the amplitude ; * the higher - loop effect from the technipions and technifermions contributing only to the gauge bosons polarisation functions inside the loop propagators vanish at small loop momentum @xmath382 , but otherwise is expected to be extremely small .",
    "we conclude , that the most stringent constraints on the parameter space in the considering cstc scenario come from the @xmath339-parameter which sets the upper bound to the @xmath127-mixing ( see previous section ) .",
    "now , we turn to a discussion of the phenomenological consequences of the cstc .",
    "the properties of the higgs sector in the sm are the subject of intensive studies and discussions in the light of the latest data from the lhc @xcite .",
    "the higgs couplings are expected to be rather sensitive to np contributions , and could therefore serve as a good probe of physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , it is important to notice here that even though the higgs boson may look standard according to the latest observations and studies , this does not totally exclude possible role of np in the ewsb and , in particular , in its underlined dynamical reasons . further in this subsection",
    "we will examine basic possible signatures of the cstc in higgs boson observables .",
    "consider first the simplest @xmath383-channel subprocess of the higgs boson production with subsequent decay into final states , i.e. @xmath384 .",
    "typically , the initial states of this subprocess are @xmath385 and the final states are @xmath386 , @xmath387 , @xmath388 , @xmath3 , and @xmath389 . as is seen from the physical lagrangian of the higgs boson interactions ( [ yukawa ] ) and ( [ l - hvvpipi ] ) , the standard tree - level @xmath308 and @xmath390 couplings are modified by a common factor @xmath391 only caused by a mixing with heavy technisigma state .    for @xmath392 ,",
    "the @xmath393 and @xmath394 couplings are loop - induced via heavy quarks , and there are no additional loop diagrams can contribute here in the framework of cstc .",
    "hence , in the higgs boson production amplitude there always comes an extra factor @xmath391 compared to the corresponding sm amplitude .",
    "further , the first three higgs decay channels @xmath386 , @xmath387 , @xmath388 are the tree - level ones , with another factor @xmath391 in the amplitude , so the corresponding amplitudes @xmath395 can only be different w.r.t . the sm ones by a factor of @xmath396 only ( or a factor of @xmath397 in the case of intermediate @xmath16 meson ) .",
    "but this is true only if one considers the @xmath383-channel production process far from the resonance , @xmath398 ( or @xmath399 for the intermediate @xmath16 meson ) .",
    "however , in the resonance region the modifications of the sm amplitudes can be different from mere mixing factor multiplication .        in order to calculate the @xmath383-channel cross section for the scalar higgs boson ( and @xmath16 meson ) production with",
    "two - particle final states one starts from the universal factorized formula which reproduces the well - known narrow - width approximation formula and has been proven to be exact in the framework of the unstable particles model with smeared mass shell ( see e.g. ref .",

    "this reveals the fact that the higgs branching ratios , in fact , in the sm and in the considering cstc scenario are the same .",

    "in fact , experimentally one never measures events exactly at the resonance peak position @xmath413 , but one rather has a smearing of the resonance by e.g. detector conditions .",
    "in this case , a more precise estimation of the higgs boson signal strength is given by the ratio of the cross sections integrated ( or averaged ) over the energy resolution of an experiment @xmath414 which can be comparable or exceeds the small higgs boson decay width in the sm , @xmath415 mev ( at @xmath253 gev ) @xcite , i.e. @xmath416dq}{\\int_{m_h-\\delta e}^{m_h+\\delta e}[(q^2-m_h^2)^2+q^2(\\gamma_{tot}^{h , mod})^2]dq}\\ , ,",

    "the final - state quarks are seen as forward - backward hard jets , and by measuring their momenta one accurately reconstructs the invariant mass of the produced state .",
    "an overall one - technipion production rate is expected to be strongly suppressed compared to the higgs boson production rate , which along with extremely narrow technipion resonance makes it rather hard to measure experimentally but not impossible .    in fig .",

    "we observe that the hadronic cross sections of the technipion production ( middle panel ) by about two orders of magnitude smaller than those for the higgs boson ( right panel ) in the same masse range . this suppression will be even stronger for smaller @xmath143 coupling and does not depend on other cstc model parameters .",
    "the respective production mechanism is thus one of the `` golden '' channels for technipion and , in general , new strongly - coupled sector searches at the lhc in measurements with high statistics .",
    "the discovery potential depends also on the subsequent decay modes and branching ratios of technipions .",
    "as was demonstrated above , the decay modes of the neutral technipion are similar to the vector - boson decay modes of the higgs boson including @xmath3 , @xmath471 and @xmath389 channels , however , @xmath497 mode is forbidden by symmetry . in the range of relatively small @xmath498 gev the strategy for searches of technipions will be similar to that in the higgs boson searches .",
    "moreover , for light technipions it turns out that the @xmath3 signals from the higgs boson and technipion can be comparable with each other due to a very small @xmath3 branching ratio of the higgs boson @xmath499 , while corresponding technipion branching is relatively large @xmath500 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - br ] ) .",
    "the issue with detection of such light technipions in the @xmath3 or @xmath389 channels can arise , however , due to a very narrow technipion resonance since in the mass range @xmath501 gev the total technipion decay width amounts to @xmath502 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - pi ] ) .",
    "such an extremely narrow resonance , in principle , can be missed in the higgs - type searches at the lhc , and an additional investigation of this possibility is necessary .",
    "also , a possibility of a relative proximity or even an overlap of the higgs resonance and extremely narrow technipion resonance is not completely excluded , and remains to be an interesting opportunity .",
    "further , a more elaborate analysis and the search for light technipions in the existing lhc data is required .    at last , heavier technipions @xmath503",
    "gev can be searched for in the @xmath3 , @xmath389 and @xmath471 decay channels which have comparable branchings .",
    "the dominant modes for the heavy higgs boson searches are typically @xmath484 and @xmath471 ones with large branchings , whereas @xmath3 , @xmath389 branchings of the higgs decay are practically zeroth . the only common channel for technipion and higgs boson in the high mass range is the @xmath471 one . however , having comparable branchings , the technipion production rate is strongly suppressed compared to that of the higgs boson ( see above ) .",
    "so , the current lhc statistics may not be enough for establishing significant constraints onto the cstc model parameter space for the higher technipion masses , and further studies are certainly needed .",
    "typical leading - order ( tree - level ) processes of the @xmath82-pair production in @xmath504 and vector boson fusion at the lhc are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - production ] . besides",
    "rather high @xmath482 pair invariant mass @xmath462 gev , an additional suppression in @xmath505 and @xmath504 production channels appear due to rather weak couplings @xmath506 and @xmath507 in @xmath508 and @xmath509 vertices respectively ( cf . eq .  ( [ l - piv ] ) ) , as well as due to a large off - resonant suppression in @xmath383-channel subprocesses with intermediate higgs and gauge bosons , which are much lightest than @xmath510 .        thus , one may naively assume that the largest contribution to the @xmath460 and @xmath461 production rates comes essentially from the intermediate technisigma resonance with the @xmath511 coupling @xmath512 which is not suppressed in the small mixing limit ( for not very heavy technifermions ) .",
    "however , in the latter case one encounters more sources of suppression .",
    "firstly , the production rate of the @xmath100 itself in the sm - like channels most likely to be suppressed by a small mixing angle , i.e. by the @xmath513 factor in the cross section , compared to the higgs boson production rate with @xmath514 ( see the previous section ) .",
    "secondly , the @xmath464 total decay width dominated by the technipion channel ( in analogy to hadron physics ) is typically large , of the order of a few hundreds of gev , which means that there will be no any resonant enhancement in the @xmath482 production rate associated with the technisigma channel .",
    "thus , overall rates of the tree - level @xmath464 and @xmath482 production are expected to be rather small , similarly to the loop - induced one technipion rates calculated above . moreover , in the small mixing or `` no @xmath96-mixing '' scenario the only possible @xmath464 production channel is through the gauge boson fusion through the technifermion and technipion triangles since the @xmath515 coupling ( [ l - qhspi ] ) is finite @xmath516 and can be rather large due to the `` fat '' tc coupling @xmath517 .",
    "besides the dominant technisigma decay mode , the @xmath482 pair may also be produced at one loop level via @xmath18 box diagrams .",
    "these details of the lightest technihadron dynamics would make the search for new technipion / technisigma states to be rather challenging at the lhc , but not impossible .            for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pip - pip - prod ] we present the @xmath460 pair production cross sections at the parton level in the vbf mechanism as functions of the @xmath518 center - of - mass energy for different initial and final quarks ( left ) and the corresponding hadron - level cross sections at the lhc ( @xmath495 tev ) as functions the technipion mass ( right ) .",
    "the quark - antiquark fusion mechanism going via @xmath99 or @xmath100 resonance is assumed to be negligible in the forward / backward jets kinematics considered here and was not included in this calculation . in opposite to the one - technipion production cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi0-prod ] , the parton - level @xmath460 pair production cross sections increase at higher @xmath518 c.m.s",
    ". energies ( or larger quark fractions @xmath519 ) and can reach the same magnitudes as the one - technipion cross sections at @xmath520 gev . the hadronic @xmath460 cross sections drop faster than corresponding one - technipion cross sections and have similar order - of - magnitude values for the light @xmath521 mass range .",
    "this means that both one- and two - technipion processes should be studied on the same footing .",
    "the latter , however , would be more difficult to identify experimentally due to a larger multiplicity of leptons and tiny widths of the technipions .",
    "to summarize , in this work we have constructed and investigated in major details the chiral - symmetric ( vector - like ) technicolor scenario , according to which a new sector of technifermions in confinement interacts with the sm gauge bosons by means of vector - like gauge couplings .",
    "our analysis is based upon the gauged linear @xmath0-model with initially global chiral - gauge @xmath57 group broken down to the _ local _ lr - symmetric sm weak isospin symmetry @xmath522 group in the technifermion sector .    the higgs boson in this scenario is considered as a separate ( fundamental or composite ) scalar state and introduced in the same way as in the one - doublet sm .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the electro - weak symmetry breaking at the scale @xmath523 gev can be initiated dynamically by the presence of the confined vector - like technifermion sector , namely , it is triggered by the technifermion condensate at the techniconfinement scale , @xmath524 , together with the chiral symmetry breaking . this thus leads to the effective sm higgs mechanism of dynamical electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "remarkably , this model is well consistent with both ew precision constraints and , simultaneously , with the recent sm - like higgs boson observations at the lhc in the small higgs - technisigma mixing limit . at the same time",
    ", the model predicts the existence of extra new lightest technihadron states , namely , physical technipions @xmath525 and technisigma @xmath464 , at the lhc energy scales , giving rise to rich technicolor phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "detection prospects for these new states have also been discussed , and the most phenomenologically important decay modes of @xmath463 and @xmath464 , as well as technipion production cross sections , were quantified over physically reasonable regions of parameter space .    in the absence of noticeable deviations from the sm predictions in the higgs signal strengths , the suggested scenario is capable of explaining of what triggers the sm higgs mechanism , the nature of the higgs vev in the nearly - conformal limit of the new strongly - coupled dynamics . the proposed vector - like technicolor scenario , in its simplest form considered here , does not attempt to resolve the naturalness problem of the sm , i.e. does not provide a mechanism protecting the higgs boson mass itself from becoming arbitrary large .",
    "nevertheless , this minimal realization of the tc ideas preserving the effective higgs mechanism of the sm opens up new prospects for more elaborated scenarios with extended chiral - gauge groups possibly predicting the light composite higgs boson(s ) with well - defined vector - like ultraviolet completion , which is the subject of our further analysis . at last , as a specific prediction of this class of models , the lightest neutral heavy weakly - interacting technibaryon state gives rise to a suitable dark matter candidate making it to be especially attractive opportunity for astrophysical new physics searches , and a corresponding analysis is planned for future studies .",

    "<S> most of the traditional technicolor - based models are known to be in a strong tension with the electroweak precision tests . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this serious issue is naturally cured in strongly coupled sectors with chiral - symmetric vector - like gauge interactions in the framework of gauged linear @xmath0-model . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible phenomenological implications of such non - standard chiral - symmetric technicolor scenario in its simplest formulation preserving the standard model ( sm ) higgs mechanism . for this purpose , we assume the existence of an extra technifermion sector confined under extra @xmath1 at the energy scales reachable at the lhc , @xmath2 tev , and interacting with the sm gauge bosons in a chiral - symmetric ( vector - like ) way . in the framework of this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the sm higgs vev acquires natural interpretation in terms of the condensate of technifermions in confinement in the nearly conformal limit . </S>",
    "<S> we study the influence of the lowest lying composite physical states , namely , technipions , technisigma and constituent technifermions , on the higgs sector properties in the sm and other observables at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we found out that the predicted higgs boson signal strengths in @xmath3 , vector - boson @xmath4 and fermion @xmath5 decay channels can be sensitive to the new strongly - coupled dynamics and are consistent with the current sm - like higgs boson observations in the limit of relatively small higgs - technisigma mixing . at the same time , the chiral - symmetric technicolor provides us with rich technipion phenomenology at the lhc , and its major implications are discussed in detail .    </S>",
