    "the gaussian envelopes of the beams ensure a smooth connection to the large three - dimensional reservoirs formed at both ends of the cloud , see fig .",
    "an attractive gate potential @xmath21 is realized by a red - detuned laser beam focused on the qpc @xcite which tunes the chemical potential in the qpc and its immediate vicinity , see fig .",

    "the position of the maximum along the gate potential axis , and the shape of the conductance variations are reproduced , but the predictions for the value of the conductance differ by about a factor of two . this discrepancy could come from interactions between quasi - particles of opposite spin , neglected in the model , in particular inside the contact where the one dimensional geometry enhances scattering @xcite .",
    "the total particle current is expected to be robust against collisions , since they conserve momentum . yet , large interaction effects are observed .",

    ", a conductance plateau with a reduced length remains visible in fig .",

    "there again , plateaux - like features with conductances higher than @xmath0 are observed for interaction strengths @xmath58 .",
    "as interactions are further increased towards the unitary regime ( @xmath59 for fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and c , @xmath60 for fig . [ fig2]b and d )",
    ", no conductance plateaux can be distinguished , and @xmath39 increases continuously from zero to large values .",
    "contrary to variations of @xmath20 , variations of @xmath21 change the density at the entrance and exit of the qpc , which probably causes the disappearance of the plateau already at a lower value of the interaction strength .",
    "the entire crossover from quantized conductance of weakly interacting atoms to its breakdown for strong interactions is mapped out in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c for fixed @xmath21 and varying @xmath20 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d for fixed @xmath20 and varying @xmath21 .",
    "the latter demonstrates most clearly that the conductance plateau , discernible as green area , shrinks gradually when the interaction strength is increased from @xmath61 to @xmath62 . in this regime",
    "the plateau width is well predicted by a mean - field model accounting for intra- and inter - mode attraction in the qpc ( si text ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe little difference between the unitary and the molecular regime in the experimentally accessible region , @xmath63 , where the reservoirs form a condensate of molecules @xcite .      in the strongly interacting regime ( deep purple regions in fig .",

    "[ fig1]c ) , i.e. at the entrance and exit of the qpc .",
    "the local critical temperature at those points thus corresponds to the maximum critical temperature over the entire cloud , and we refer to it as @xmath64 for the remainder . to extract it",
    ", we use the state - of - the - art calculation of @xmath65 @xcite in local density approximation , with @xmath66 being the fermi energy of a homogeneous gas with density @xmath67 .",
    "we estimate @xmath67 at the entrance and exit of the qpc from the trap geometry and the equation of state of the low - temperature , tunable fermi gas ( si text ) .",

    "[ fig2]d for fixed @xmath70k .",
    "we observe that the resulting conductances now coincide within error bars .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath68 is a key control parameter of the transition , despite the fact that the two data sets correspond to different geometries in the single mode regime .",
    "the fast increase of particle conductance coincides with a sharp drop in the spin conductance around @xmath71 , demonstrating directly the intimate connection between pairing and superfluidity .",
    "the regime of non - universal quantisation , with a conductance larger than @xmath0 as identified by our measurement method and accuracy , extends from @xmath72 , corresponding to the shoulder observed at @xmath73 , to far above the superfluid transition , up to @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that in this regime , where @xmath75 at every point in the cloud , current is not carried by fermionic quasiparticles , challenging a description in terms of fermi liquids .",
    "a possible interpretation for the anomalously high conductance , i.e. exceeding @xmath0 in the normal , single mode regime , is the presence of strong superfluid fluctuations in the reservoirs , due to the large critical region around the superfluid transition @xcite .",
    "the critical fluctuations are qualitatively similar to that of the luttinger liquid in one dimension with attractive interactions in the leads , where they are known to yield an enhanced conductance @xcite .",
    "another possibility are preformed pairs above @xmath64 , that could form in particular in the contact region @xcite , leading to a channel with a bosonic character , where large conductances are expected @xcite .",
    "evidence for such non - fermi liquid behaviour in the bec - bcs crossover was found using photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , in contrast to results based on the equation of state @xcite .",

    "a landau - zener radio frequency transition then transfers the full population from the second to the third hyperfine state , and the magnetic field is ramped up to @xmath79 g , the centre of a feshbach resonance @xcite , where the s - wave scattering length diverges .",
    "a second step of forced evaporation is then performed using a magnetic field gradient , yielding the low temperature clouds used for the transport measurements .",

    "[ fig1]e ) , we ramp the magnetic field before the landau - zener transfer in 10ms from 302 g down to 52 g , where the lowest and second lowest hyperfine states have different magnetic moments , and apply at the same time a magnetic field gradient along the transport axis .",
    "this induces dipole oscillations with different frequencies and different amplitudes for the two states .",
    "we wait for roughly one period of the faster oscillation before we abruptly switch on an elliptic repulsive gate laser beam separating the reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is then ramped back to a value close to its initial value , from where we transfer all the atoms in state @xmath87 to state @xmath88 using an adiabatic landau - zener radio frequency transfer .",
