    "most of the _ nlo _ radiative corrections to rates have been done quite some years ago .",
    "in fact , two  loop _ nnlo",
    "_ calculations for rates are now becoming quite standard .",
    "in @xmath3annihilation one is even pushing hard to determine the _ nnnnlo _ corrections to the @xmath4 ratio @xcite .",
    "contrary to this , many _ nlo _ radiative correction calculations to polarization observables involving also massive quarks have only been done in the last few years .",
    "it is clear that higher order radiative corrections to unpolarized observables will always be at the center of attention because data on unpolarized observables are as a rule much more accurate than data for polarized observables .",
    "nevertheless , as experimental data on polarization observables has been accumulating over the years there is an evolving need for radiative corrections to polarization observables .",
    "one of the reasons that polarized radiative correction were lagging behind unpolarized radiative corrections is that the computational effort in the calculation of radiative corrections to polarization observables is larger than that for rates .",
    "for once , one can not sum over the spins of intermediate states whose polarization one wants to calculate .",
    "one therefore can not make use of the powerful unitarity method to calculate radiative corrections from the absorptive parts of higher order loop graphs .",
    "further , the definition of polarization observables brings in extra momentum factors in the integrands of the requisite phase space integrals which makes life more difficult .",
    "this is particularly true if the masses of particles in the process can not be neglected .",
    "for example , in the process @xmath5 the longitudinal component of the polarization vector of the top quark along the @xmath6direction is given by    @xmath7    where the denominator factor @xmath8 comes in for normalization reasons ( @xmath9 is the momentum of the @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is quite clear that such square root factors lead to nontrivial complications in the phase space integrations .",
    "similar square root factors appear when projecting onto the polarization states of the @xmath10 .",
    "inclusion of mass effects as e.g. in the semileptonic decay @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) or in the leptonic decay @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) render the analytical calculations considerably more complicated .",
    "the villain is the kllen function @xmath15 which is brought in by extra three  momentum factors . in the case",
    "that e.g. @xmath16 the kllen function simplifies to @xmath17 which leads to an enormous simplification in the phase space integrals .    physically speaking mass effects",
    "become large in regions of phase space where the massive particles become nonrelativistic .",
    "for example , in the leptonic decay of the muon @xmath18 , the mass of the electron can not be neglected in the threshold region where the energy of the electron is small .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] where the longitudinal polarization of the electron is plotted against the scaled energy @xmath19 of the electron @xcite .",
    "we have chosen a logarithmic scale for @xmath20 in order to enhance the threshold region .",
    "in the threshold region the longitudinal polarization deviates considerably from the naive value @xmath21 .",
    "the radiative corrections in the threshold region can be seen to be quite large .",
    "all our results are given in closed analytic form .",
    "in the days of fast numerical computers one may rightfully ask what the advantage of having closed form expressions is .",
    "one of the advantages is that all requisite mass and momentum limits can be taken in analytic form .",
    "thus the analytic results can be subjected to tests against known limiting cases providing for the necessary checks of the full results .",
    "a second issue is user  friendliness .",
    "the analytic expressions are simple enough to be incorporated in numerical programs by the prospective user .",
    "parameter values such as masses and coupling constants can be varied at will by the user in his own program without having to refer to numerical programs written by others .",
    "we have checked that our analytical formulas are numerically stable even in the small and large mass limits .    _",
    "nlo _ corrections to rates can be quite large .",
    "_ nlo _ corrections to polarization observables have a tendency to be somewhat smaller .",
    "the reason is that polarization observables are normalized quantities .",
    "they are normalized with regard to the total rate .",
    "the numerators and denominators in the relevant polarization expressions tend to go in the same direction .",
    "the reason is that the _ nlo _ numerators and denominators are dominated by the soft gluon or soft photon contributions which are universal in the sense that they multiply the relevant born term expressions and thus cancel out in the ratio .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 the @xmath22 correction to the rate is @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the polarization observables @xcite .    at _ nlo _ some density matrix elements become populated which vanish at leading order .",
    "an example is again the decay @xmath5 where the rate into the right  handed @xmath10 vanishes ( @xmath25 ) for @xmath26 at _ lo _ but where @xmath27 at _ nlo_. generally speaking , standard model radiative corrections can populate density matrix elements elements that vanish at leading order .",
    "consequently radiative corrections change angular decay distributions as do new physics effects .",
    "the lesson to be learned is clear . before ascribing a given polarization effect to new physics one has to make sure that it does not result from radiative corrections of old physics . in the above example a non  zero @xmath27 could result from an admixture of a right ",
    "handed charged current ( new physics ) or from radiative corrections .",
    "only the precise knowledge of the magnitude of the radiative corrections allows one to exclude or conclude for new physics effects .    in this review",
    "we will mostly be concerned with radiative corrections to the current  induced transitions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it should be clear that the additional gluons ( or photons ) in radiative correction calculations only couple to the @xmath31 ( or @xmath30 ) side of the relevant semileptonic ( or leptonic ) transitions .",
    "this implies that the structure of the _ nlo _ radiative corrections is the same in the two classes of processes .",
    "the current  induced transition @xmath30 is not in the standard model form but in the charge retention form .",
    "however , the charge retention form can be linked to the standard model form by the remarkable property that the @xmath32 interaction is an eigenvector under fierz crossing ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "one therefore has    @xmath33      [ \\bar{e } \\gamma_{\\alpha } ( { 1 \\hspace{-0.95 mm } { \\rm l}}- \\gamma_5 ) \\nu_{e } ] + \\mbox{h.c . }",

    "in particular the _ nlo _ qed and qcd radiative corrections have the same structure for all three transitions . in table  1",
    "we provide a list of the processes for which the radiative corrections to the rates and the polarization observables can all be calculated from essentially the same set of _ nlo _ matrix elements . in this review",
    "we shall only present a few sample results from the processes in table  [ tab1 ] because the results are to numerous to fit into a review of the present size .",
    "instead we attempt to share our insights into the general features of spin physics and illustrate these with sample results taken from the processes in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "it should be clear that one needs to do polarization measurements in order to disentangle the full structure of particle interactions .",
    "polarization measurements are particularly simple when the particle whose polarization one wants to measure decays .",
    "the angular decay distribution of the decay products reveals information on the state of polarization of the decaying particle .",
    "the information contained in the angular decay distribution is maximal when the particle decay is weak .",
    "the fact that the angular decay distribution reveals information on the polarization of the decaying particle is sometimes referred to as that the particle decay is self  analyzing .",
    "there are principally two ways to obtain angular decay distributions which we will refer to as the non  covariant and the covariant methods . in the non",
    " covariant method one makes use of rotation matrices whereas in the covariant method one evaluates scalar products of four  vectors involving momenta and spin four  vectors in given reference frames .",
    "we shall discuss one example each of the two methods .",
    "as an example for the non  covariant method we write down the angular decay distribution of polarized top decay @xmath34 followed by @xmath35 .",
    "the angular decay distribution can be obtained from the master formula    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the density matrix of the top quark which reads    @xmath38    @xmath39 is the magnitude of the polarization of the top quark .",
    "the @xmath40 are helicity matrix elements of the hadronic structure function @xmath41 .",
    "the sum in ( [ masterformula ] ) extends over all values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 compatible with the constraint @xmath44 .",
    "the second lower index in the small wigner @xmath45function @xmath46 is fixed at @xmath47 for zero mass leptons because the total @xmath48quantum number of the lepton pair along the @xmath49 direction is @xmath47 . because there exist different conventions for wigner s @xmath50functions we explicate the requisite components that enter ( [ masterformula ] ) : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the fact that one has to specify the phase convention of the wigner s @xmath50functions points to one of the weaknesses of the non  covariant method to obtain the correct angular decay distributions : one has to use one set of consistent phase conventions to obtain the correct signs for the angular factors . for someone not",
    "not so familiar with the angular momentum apparatus this is not always simple . for the polar angle dependencies",
    "the correctness of a sign can always be checked by using physics arguments .",
    "this is more difficult for the azimuthal signs .    including the appropriate normalization factor",
    "the four  fold decay distribution is given by @xcite    @xmath54    where the helicity structure functions @xmath55",
    ", @xmath56 etc .",
    "are linear combinations of the helicity matrix elements @xmath40 we have taken the freedom to normalize the differential rate such that one obtains the total @xmath57 rate upon integration _ and not _ the total rate multiplied by the branching ratio of the respective @xmath10 decay channel .    the polar angles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the azimuthal angle @xmath60 that arise in the full cascade  type description of the two  stage decay process @xmath61 are defined in fig .  [ plot4 ] .",
    "for better visibility we have oriented the lepton plane with a negative azimuthal angle relative to the hadron plane .",
    "for the hadronic decays of the @xmath6 into a pair of light quarks one has to replace @xmath62 by @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] .",
    "we mention that we have checked the signs of the angular decay distribution ( [ diffrate ] ) using covariant techniques .    at first sight",
    "it seems rather strange that the angular analysis is done in two different coordinate systems , namely the top quark rest system and the @xmath6 rest system .",
    "this runs counter to common wisdom that invariants should always be evaluated in one reference system . some insight into the problem",
    "may be gained by using the orthonormality and completeness relation of polarization vectors to rewrite the contraction of the hadron and lepton tensors in a form which exhibits the correctness of using two different reference systems for the cascade decay .",

    "the leptonic invariant @xmath71 can be evaluated in the @xmath72 cm frame ( or in the @xmath10 rest frame ) while the hadronic invariant @xmath73 can be evaluated in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "another advantage of this method is that one can easily incorporate lepton mass effects as is mandatory for @xmath29 or the rare @xmath74 transitions if the charged lepton or leptons in the final state are @xmath1 leptons .",
    "this technique was used to derive angular decay distributions including leptonic polarization effects for semileptonic and rare bottom meson decays in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note also that the correct phase choice for the polarization vectors is no longer crucial since the polarization vectors always appear as squares in the orthonormality and completeness relations .    as an example of the covariant method we discuss the angular decay distribution of polarized @xmath0 decay into a polarized @xmath75 . from helicity counting as described in sect .  4",
    "one knows that there are altogether five spin  dependent structure functions and one spin ",

    "<S> we provide examples of reactions where certain density matrix elements are only populated at _ nlo _ or by mass effects . in our discussion we concentrate on semileptonic bottom and top quark decays which are linked to leptonic @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays through a fierz transformation .    </S>",
