    "<S> while both the dynes formula and the one proposed in this work give good fits and fit parameters for pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 , only the latter formula can be justified microscopically .    </S>",
    "<S> almost thirty years ago dynes , narayanamurti and garno @xcite proposed that the quasiparticle recombination time in a strong - coupled superconductor can be directly measured from the width of the peak in the tunneling conductance @xmath4 of a superconductor - insulator - superconductor tunnel junction at the sum of the gaps . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the data on pb@xmath2bi@xmath3-insulator - pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 planar tunnel junction could be fitted quite well for voltages near twice the gap if the quasiparticle density of states @xmath5 in the expression for the tunneling current @xmath6\\ ] ] is replaced by @xmath7 with real and e - independent @xmath8 and the measured gap edge @xmath9 . in ( [ qpdos ] ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the complex gap function and @xmath11 and @xmath12 in ( [ current ] ) are the fermi function at temperature @xmath13 and the magnitude of electron charge , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed @xcite that the temperature dependent parameter @xmath8 in ( [ dynes_formula ] ) incorporates the quasiparticle lifetime effects . a good agreement between the measured @xmath14 and a microscopic calculation @xcite based on the work by kaplan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a number of temperatures below the transition temperature @xmath15 of pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 was taken as a justification for the replacement of @xmath16 with @xmath17 and for the interpretation of parameter 2@xmath8 as the inverse of the quasiparticle recombination lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> formula ( [ dynes_formula ] ) is now widely known as the dynes formula and it has been applied to a variety of low temperature ( @xmath18 ) tunneling experiments ranging from tunneling into the bulk @xcite and thin film @xcite inhomogeneous / granular superconductors to the tunneling into a two - band superconductor mgb@xmath19 @xcite and tunneling into a novel superconductor cac@xmath20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynes formula was also recently used to describe the density of states obtained in photoemission studies of superconducting h - zrrup @xcite and of filled skutterudite superconductor laru@xmath21p@xmath22 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the _ ansatz _ ( [ dynes_formula ] ) can not be justified for a conventional strong coupling superconductor , such as pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 @xcite , from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath16 is given in terms of the diagonal electron green s function in the superconducting state @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the complex renormalization function and @xmath25 is the complex pairing self - energy @xcite , as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the normal state density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> all interactions enter via the self - energy terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 and assuming that they do not depend on momentum @xmath28 one finds @xmath29 where in the last step @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been eliminated in favor of the gap function @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , all the lifetime effects which enter via @xmath31 and @xmath30 are ultimately incorporated in the complex gap function @xmath10 and the tunneling current @xmath33 depends on the full complex gap function as is clear from equations ( [ qpdos ] ) and ( [ current ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that ( [ sequence1 ] ) can not be cast into the form ( [ dynes_formula ] ) by a suitable choice of @xmath30 ( e.g.  taking @xmath34 would give @xmath35 $ ] , where the pairing self - energy @xmath25 appears instead of the gap @xmath36 , and the measured @xmath37 gives @xmath36 and not @xmath25 ) .    instead of replacing @xmath16 with @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> it is more reasonable to keep @xmath10 in ( [ qpdos ] ) constant but complex for @xmath38 not too far from the gap edge @xmath9 , i.e.  replace ( [ qpdos ] ) with @xmath39 where @xmath0 is the imaginary part of the gap at @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that at a finite temperature the imaginary part of the gap at the gap edge is finite as a result of quasiparticle damping ( see figure 45 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is easy to prove that in the quasiparticle approximation @xcite the quasiparticle decay rate at the gap edge is equal to -2@xmath41 . assuming that at @xmath42 the imaginary parts @xmath43 and and @xmath44 of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , are much smaller than the corresponding real parts one finds that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the real part of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> expression ( [ proof ] ) is identical to the equation of kaplan _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ for the quasiparticle decay rate parameter @xmath48 @xcite ( see equation ( 5 ) in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is quite general and does not depend on the specific interactions leading to quasiparticle damping , i.e. whether it is the electron - phonon interaction which was considered in @xcite , or the dynamically screened coulomb interaction in the presence of disorder which was assumed to be the cause of lifetime broadening in _ low _ temperature tunneling experiments into three - dimensional granular aluminum @xcite and quench - condensed two - dimensional films of pb and sn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all that is required for @xmath49 to be valid , where 2@xmath50 is the inverse quasiparticle lifetime with @xmath28 on the fermi surface , is that the imaginary parts of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are much smaller than their respective real parts near the gap - edge . needless to say , ( [ theorem ] ) </S>",
    "<S> does not apply to unconventional superconductors characterized by @xmath530 , where fs is the fermi surface , for @xmath28 near the gap nodes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 we find that equation ( [ complex - delta ] ) produces fits to @xmath4 which are at least as good as those obtained with the dynes formula ( [ dynes_formula ] ) . instead of trying to fit the original data from @xcite , which in addition to the temperature dependent lifetime broadening were assumed to contain an intrinsic ( background ) width of 0.01mev </S>",
    "<S> , we fitted @xmath4 calculated from the solutions @xmath10 and @xmath30 of the finite temperature eliashberg equations @xcite on the real axis using the eliashberg function @xmath54 for pb@xmath2bi@xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the width of the peak in our calculated @xmath4 arises solely from the temperature dependent lifetime broadening and we could compare directly the value of the fit parameter @xmath1 in equation ( [ complex - delta ] ) with our solution @xmath55 for @xmath38 at the gap edge . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we could calculate the decay rate parameter @xmath56 directly from our solutions of eliashberg equations @xcite ( see equation ( 4 ) in @xcite ) @xmath57\\ ] ] and compare its value at @xmath42 with @xmath1 obtained from the fits with equation ( [ complex - delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that there is a good agreement between the shapes of the calculated @xmath4 and the measured ones @xcite down to @xmath582.75 k as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] for t=3.5 k. in figure [ fig : fig1 ] the results are plotted as functions of @xmath59 since with our choice of the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath60=0.1034 , which was fitted to the experimental zero temperature gap edge @xmath61=1.54 mev @xcite for the cutoff @xmath62=100 mev in the eliashberg equations , we obtain somewhat higher values of @xmath9 than those found in @xcite . as the coulomb pseudopotential term in the eliashberg equations is purely real it does not affect the imaginary parts of the solutions @xcite .    in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] we show the fits to the calculated @xmath37 using the dynes formula ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and the formula with the complex gap ( [ complex - delta ] ) . on the scale of figure [ fig : fig2 ] , which was chosen to match the scale of figure 2 in @xcite , both equations ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and ( [ complex - delta ] ) give equally good fits . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the values of the fit parameter @xmath1 turn out to be nearly the same as the values of the fit parameter @xmath8 at all temperatures considered . </S>",
    "<S> one can understand why two different functional forms ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and ( [ complex - delta ] ) give nearly identical fits to @xmath37 with nearly identical fit parameters @xmath63 from the fact that in the limit @xmath64 the approximations ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and ( [ complex - delta ] ) to @xmath65 give @xmath662 and @xmath672 , respectively and the height of the peak in @xmath37 is most sensitive to the maximum in the quasiparticle density of states . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that as the lifetime broadening grows compared to the gap edge the difference between the fit parameters obtained with ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and with ( [ complex - delta ] ) increases and the quality of fits with the dynes formula deteriorates compared to the fits with ( [ complex - delta ] ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , in particular at lower voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that for @xmath64 in the limit of small energy @xmath68 , while @xmath69 to the first order in @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath70 does not vanish at @xmath38=0 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the experimental _ low - temperature _ densities of states obtained for three - dimensional granular aluminum @xcite do vanish at @xmath38=0 ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) , while those obtained for two - dimensional quench - condensed tin films @xcite do not ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precise reason for such a difference between three - dimensional and two - dimensional disordered conventional superconductors is not known at the present time .    </S>",
    "<S> as one could have expected , the fitted values of @xmath1 turned out to be equal to the imaginary parts of our solutions @xmath10 of the eliashberg equations at @xmath40 to within a few percent at all temperatures considered . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath1 extracted from the fits to the calculated @xmath37 agree with the values of the fit parameter @xmath71 reported in @xcite before correction for the background to within a percent or two down to @xmath13=4.2 k. at @xmath13=3.5 k the difference is about 30% and yet the shapes of the calculated and measured @xmath37 in figure [ fig : fig1 ] seem to agree quite well </S>",
    "<S> . a further reduction of the measured @xmath72 by the background value of 0.01mev would increase the difference between the lifetime broadening parameters to about 150% . at @xmath13=2.75 </S>",
    "<S> k our fitted value ( the fit is not shown here ) is @xmath1=0.00226 mev which is 80% lower than the measured @xmath72 @xcite or more than twice the measured value after the correction for the background . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite plausible that at low temperatures , when both the experimental and the theoretical data in the peak change very rapidly , it is difficult to determine the actual maximum in @xmath37 to which the fit parameters are most sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the maximum in @xmath37 gets underestimated at low @xmath13 having as a consequence too high values of the lifetime broadening parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that is the reason for the discrepancies between our fitted values of @xmath1 and those found in @xcite at low temperatures and that there is no need to invoke the intrinsic temperature - independent broadening parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , in figure [ fig : fig4 ] we show the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath73 at the gap edge obtained from @xmath74 ( open squares ) and @xmath75=2(@xmath72 - 0.01mev ) ( filled circles ) with the values of @xmath72 taken from figure 2 in @xcite . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> we show theoretical predictions for the recombination time @xmath76 ( solid line ) and the total lifetime @xmath73 ( dashed line ) at the gap edge based on approximate equations of kaplan _ et al . _ </S>",

    "<S> was taken as a justification of the dynes formula ( [ dynes_formula ] ) in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the integrand in ( [ recomb ] ) has a square root singularity at the lower limit of integration which has to be handled analytically if @xmath76 is not to be overestimated . comparing figure 3 in @xcite and figure 4 in this work </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that our calculated @xmath76 is considerably lower at the low temperatures than the one calculated in @xcite as the filled circles in both figures represent @xmath81/2(@xmath72 - 0.01mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show in figure [ fig : fig4 ] the lifetime calculated directly from our solutions of the eliashberg equations in the quasiparticle approximation @xmath82 ( plus signs ) , where @xmath83 is computed using equation ( [ exact ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the values for the total quasiparticle lifetime @xmath73 at the gap edge obtained from the fits with formula ( [ complex - delta ] ) and both theoretical predictions is excellent .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that one can , indeed , obtain the total quasiparticle lifetime at the gap edge from the fits of the derivatives of the @xmath84 characteristic of a superconductor - insulator - superconductor tunnel junctions using equation ( [ complex - delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the parameter 2@xmath1 as the quasiparticle decay rate at the gap edge is microscopically justified . </S>",
    "<S> while the dynes formula ( [ dynes_formula ] ) gives correct values for the total quasiparticle lifetime , it can not be justified for conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> hence the fact that it works , at least for the cases when the quasiparticle decay rate is less than about 20% of the gap edge , is a pure accident . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that for larger values of @xmath85 , which seems to be the case in laru@xmath21p@xmath22 ( @xmath8650% ) @xcite , equations ( [ dynes_formula ] ) and ( [ complex - delta ] ) would give qualitatively and quantitatively different results .    </S>",
