    "although other variants have been defined in the literature @xcite , as quantifier of the tendency of adjacent vertices to have similar or dissimilar degrees , we will consider the standard measure of ( linear ) degree - degree correlations , namely , the assortativity ( pearson ) coefficient @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes average over edges and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the degrees of vertices at each end of an edge . despite this coefficient",

    "a network with @xmath16 nodes is assembled by selecting @xmath28 different pairs of nodes at random and linking each pair .",

    "we built power - law networks by means of the configuration model @xcite . following this procedure ,",

    "( i ) pgr ( power grid ) displays plots of @xmath57 vs @xmath0 and @xmath14 vs @xmath0 that are in good accord with those observed for similar parameters @xmath27 and @xmath16 of the poisson case .",
    "in fact its degree distribution decays exponentially .",

    "both plots of p2p are in agreement with those obtained for the @xmath126 class with similar values of @xmath16 and @xmath27 , despite the distributions only share in common the power - law tail .",
    "( iii ) pgp ( of size similar to p2p ) has a degree distribution that decays with exponent @xmath78 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 beyond @xcite .",
    "the plot for @xmath14 vs @xmath0 presents larger values of @xmath14 than p2p consistent with its @xmath27 .",
    "however , the plot @xmath57 vs @xmath0 of pgp deviates from the standard behavior , presenting larger values of @xmath57 that increase with @xmath0 in a single regime .",
    "the interval of allowed values of @xmath0 is sensitive also to features other than the tails .",
    "these deviations can be attributed to different initial power law regimes .",
    "( iv ) finally , apc has a power - law decay with exponent @xmath129 and exponential cut - off for @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the low and constant plot of @xmath14 vs @xmath0 is expected for a network with large @xmath27 , almost independently of the class of degree distribution .",
    "the large values of @xmath57 are also consistent with heterogeneous distributions with large @xmath27 .",
    "then , despite the different details of real degree distributions , the main observed features can be interpreted in terms of the analyzed classes with corresponding values of parameters @xmath27 and @xmath16 .",
    "for all classes of networks considered , @xmath57 increases with @xmath0 in the whole allowed range of @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior has already been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only positive values of @xmath0 were analyzed and also in ref .",
    "@xcite although different definitions of clustering and correlation were used .",
    "however , we observed that , in the @xmath0-ensemble , a non - vanishing clustering coefficient @xmath57 is typically due to finite size effects , such that , in the large size limit , network transitivity vanishes as @xmath131 .",
    "in contrast , for power - law networks characterized by @xmath0 above a threshold , a significantly non - null transitivity arises , apparently persisting for large @xmath16 .    in any case , since rewiring in the @xmath0-ensemble turns @xmath57 typically small , transitivity does not seem to contribute for attaining the prescribed value of @xmath0 . to identify the factors that contribute to @xmath0 , it is useful to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ def_r ] ) . recalling that @xmath132 @xcite , where @xmath133 ( without subindex ) means computed over the degree distribution @xmath1 , then eq .  ( [ def_r ] ) becomes @xmath134    following the decomposition made by estrada @xcite , notice that the quantity @xmath135 , where the sum is performed over all the different pairs of neighboring vertices , is the number of paths of length three , then @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the number of nontriangular paths of length three ( involving four vertices ) . as done in eq .",
    "( [ ntriangle ] ) for @xmath138 , let us scale also @xmath137 by the number of wedges ( paths of length two ) @xmath139 , defining @xmath140 ( scaled branching ) @xcite .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) can be written as @xmath141 expression ( [ r2 ] ) is determined by the three first raw moments of @xmath1 , and also by @xmath142 and @xmath57 that are the quantities embodying the information on the linear degree - degree correlations .",
    "for the poisson distributed networks , by taking into account the analytical expressions for the moments of @xmath1 , it is straightforward to see that @xmath143 clearly , dissassortative correlations are favored by vanishing @xmath57 . only for positive @xmath0 the growth of @xmath57 is convenient , but @xmath144 can vary in a wider interval than @xmath57 ( twice wider in this case ) .",
    "the existence of two regimes in the increase of @xmath145 , observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : erc ] , is consistent with this picture .",
    "in other words , eq .",
    "( [ rpoisson ] ) indicates that , in the rewiring process of a poisson network to attain @xmath56 , as soon as @xmath1 is conserved and @xmath57 remains very small , then @xmath0 is ruled predominantly by @xmath142 .    for the power - law distributed networks ,",
    "some qualitatively similar effects occur , as far as the relation of @xmath0 with @xmath142 and @xmath57 is always linear and @xmath57 is constrained to a narrower interval than @xmath142 .",
    "the formation of triangles also in this case contributes only for assortative values of @xmath0 ( above the crossover ) , with values of @xmath57 larger than in the poisson case but still small",
    ". then also in this case the increase of the branching must drive rewiring .",
    "in contrast to the poisson case , the other terms in eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , related to the moments of @xmath1 , might have a crucial influence on @xmath0 because of the divergence , in the infinite network limit , of the @xmath7th moments for @xmath146 .",
    "let us analyze the large @xmath147 ( hence @xmath16 ) limit , setting aside the marginal ( logarithmic ) cases . here",
    ", we use the result @xmath148 .",
    "however , if used instead @xmath149 , the conclusions would remain the same .",
    "considering the expressions for the moments ( e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) ) , one has , for @xmath150 : @xmath151/{\\cal o}(n^ { 4-\\gamma } ) $ ] , while for @xmath152 : @xmath153/{\\cal o}(n ) $ ] , meaning @xmath154 , with @xmath155 . to approach the lower limit @xmath156",
    ", one must have minimal @xmath142 .",
    "if it is of order greater than the other terms in the numerator , then one can not have negative @xmath0 , because @xmath142 is non - negative and it will dominate the numerator . thus , negative @xmath0 can arise only if @xmath142 is of the same or lower order .",
    "but in that case @xmath81 in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "this explains why the lower bound @xmath68 tends to 0 when @xmath157 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rlim](b ) ) . along this line , however , @xmath68 is not expected to vanish when @xmath158 , but to tend to a small finite value .",
    "similarly , to attain a non - null upper bound of @xmath0 , @xmath142 needs to grow like the denominator , otherwise , the upper bound will be negative and also vanish when @xmath159 , leading to the collapse of the upper bound too .",
    "however , this does not necessarily happens if @xmath142 is driven to grow enough during rewiring , which is what seems to be happen according to fig .",
    "[ fig : rlim](b ) .",
    "the connection between @xmath0 and distance measures is not so direct analytically .",
    "numerical results showed that , for networks with localized distribution of links , changing @xmath0 modifies significantly the mean path length only when correlations are assortative ( @xmath160 ) and @xmath59 small .",
    "these changes could be related to the induced fragmentation , that diminishes by increasing @xmath59 .",
    "then , the impact of @xmath0 becomes less important as @xmath59 increases .",
    "meanwhile , the influence on the diameter is more dramatic . in power - law networks ,",
    "the modification of the mean path length by @xmath0 is a bit more marked even if fragmentation is absent for @xmath161 , while the diameter is not largely affected . in both cases ,",
    "the modification of characteristic lengths that occur when varying @xmath0 may affect transport processes and should be taken into account either when interpreting or designing numerical experiments on top of these networks .",
