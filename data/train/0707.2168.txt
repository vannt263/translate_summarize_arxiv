    "the properties of the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath0li have been discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental papers but knowledge about its structure is still uncertain . in the past year , the results of two important measurements have been published , namely , the rms ( root - mean - square ) charge radius of @xmath0li obtained from laser spectroscopy @xcite and the dipole response , which was probed by coulomb dissociation on a pb target @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the two measurements can be explained simultaneously within a three - body model and to see what are the implications of the two results for the structure of @xmath0li .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0li is an excellent example of a so - called borromean system , a bound three - body system in which none of the two - body subsystems form a bound state .",
    "thus @xmath0li can be viewed as a three - body system consisting of a @xmath1li core and two valence neutrons where neither @xmath3li nor the dineutron system has a bound state .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0li has only one bound state with a two - neutron separation energy of about 300 kev .",
    "theoretical studies of @xmath0li have primarily been based on three - body models of the two valence neutrons interacting with the @xmath1li core , and it has been a major challenge over the past 1015 years to obtain information about the neutron - core interaction , i.  e. , about the scattering states in the unbound nucleus @xmath3li .",
    "early studies @xcite assumed a dominant p - wave structure of the two - neutron halo , based on a rather high - lying p - wave resonance in @xmath3li .",
    "another model @xcite assumed a shallow neutron - core potential , which does not have any bound states , and this resulted in a strongly s - wave dominated ground state of the two - neutron halo . in order to explore the structure of @xmath0li , a wider range of models",
    "were developed @xcite and compared to measurements .",
    "a better calibration of three - body models for @xmath0li became possible with an accurate measurement of the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath4 = 295@xmath515 kev @xcite , and a production measurement @xcite which probed the continuum of @xmath3li .",
    "the latter measurement suggested a p - wave resonance at about 540 kev and some influence of s - wave scattering near threshold .",
    "let us also mention that the quadrupole moments of @xmath1li and @xmath0li are the same within the 15% experimental uncertainty @xcite ; this can be taken as a justification for using three - body models .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath6-decay of @xmath0li @xcite showed that about 4555 % of the two - neutron halo must be in @xmath7 orbits , whereas the remaining part would most likely occupy s - waves .",
    "analyses of the momentum distributions produced in high - energy breakup reactions also suggested a large s - wave component , from 2040 % @xcite to 35 - 55 % @xcite .",
    "in fact , there seems to be a consensus toward a large s - wave component in two - neutron ground state , a component that is much larger than what was expected .",
    "this feature may be related to the famous parity inversion in the neighboring nucleus @xmath0be , where the ground state is a @xmath8 state and not a @xmath9 state as one naively would expect for a p - shell nucleus .",
    "it is of interest to see how the recent charge radius @xcite and dipole response @xcite measurements fit into this trend .",
    "there is a very close relationship within a three - body model between the charge radius and the dipole response of a two - neutron halo since they are both probes of the distance between the @xmath1li core and the center - of - mass of the dineutron system .",
    "the mean square charge radius @xmath10 for point - nucleons , for example , can be expressed in terms of the charge radius of the core nucleus as follows , @xmath11 where the second term is the correction which is caused by the center of mass motion of the core nucleus in the presence of the two valence neutrons .",
    "the correction is proportional to the mean square distance , @xmath12 , between the core and the center of mass of the dineutron system .",
    "the total strength of the dipole response of a two - neutron halo nucleus is approximately given by the cluster sum rule @xcite , @xmath13 which is also expressed in terms of the mean square distance , @xmath12 , between the core and the dineutron system .",
    "the sum rule assumes that the total dipole strength can be calculated by closure , which includes dipole transitions to the pauli blocked core states .",
    "the effect of pauli blocking is a minor but not insignificant correction , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "however , if we ignore it , we see that the charge radius and dipole response measurements are closely related , since they are both probes of the core - dineutron distance .    to make contact with the measured charge radius @xmath14 we must correct the point - proton charge radii of eq .",
    "( [ ppchr ] ) for the finite sizes of protons and neutrons .",
    "we should also consider the so - called darwin - foldy contribution and the effect of the spin - orbit charge density discussed in ref .",
    "we therefore have the expression , @xmath15 where @xmath16 = 0.757(14 ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 = -0.1161(22 ) @xmath17 are the mean square charge radii of protons and neutrons @xcite , respectively , and @xmath19 $ ] is the darwin - foldy term .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ ppchr ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sizecor ] ) we obtain the following expression for the difference between the mean square charge radii of the two - neutron halo nucleus and the core nucleus , @xmath20 @xmath21 it is seen that the proton charge radius @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ sizecor ] ) drops out of eq .",
    "( [ chreq ] ) , and so does the constant darwin - foldy term .",
    "the only two corrections that survive , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are due to the non - zero , mean square charge radius of a neutron and the spin - orbit charge density of the two valence neutrons .    in the following",
    "we ignore the spin - orbit correction to the charge radius except when otherwise explicitly stated .",
    "the reason is that this correction is model dependent , so it is not obvious how one should convert the measured isotope shift into a mean square , core - dineutron distance .",
    "one can calculate the spin - orbit correction in different models from the explicit expressions that are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the shell model for spherical nuclei , with two valence neutrons occupying an unfilled @xmath25 sub - shell ,",

    "this implies that the charge radius of @xmath0li extracted from the coulomb dissociation experiment is 2.41(4 ) fm , which is consistent with the directly measured value of 2.467(37 ) fm @xcite .",
    "the main part of the uncertainty in the charge radius of @xmath0li stems from the uncertainty in the charge radius of @xmath1li .",
    "a better representation of the discrepancy we obtain in our three - body - model interpretation of the measured charge radius and dipole response of @xmath0li is the difference @xmath59 @xmath60 this is the result we obtain when we adopt revised finite mass corrections of ref .",

    "this constraint provides a lower limit which is close to the upper limit of the matter radius shown in fig .",
    "3 , and it would therefore favor the @xmath55 over the @xmath40 model . however , we do not think this is a reasonable solution because the @xmath55 model produces a dipole response that has roughly a 33% larger strength than what has been observed ( compare the values of @xmath64 shown in table ii ) .",
    "we think that the 1.5@xmath2 discrepancy we obtain in our three - body model interpretation of the measured charge radius and dipole response of @xmath0li is most likely caused by the neglect of core polarization .",
    "actually , it may seem surprising that the effect of core polarization is not much more dramatic .    in order to estimate the effect of core polarization",
    ", we have performed skyrme hartree - fock calculations for @xmath1li and @xmath0li using the filling approximation and the sgii interaction .",
    "the results show that the mean - square charge radius of @xmath0li increases by 0.3 @xmath17 from that of @xmath1li because of the core polarization effect , which is caused by the proton - neutron interaction when the valence neutrons occupy p - waves , whereas it increases by about 0.2 @xmath17 for s - waves .",
    "this accounts roughly for the discrepancy , eq .",
    "( [ discr ] ) , between the charge radius and the coulomb dissociation experiment .",
    "we conclude that it would be desirable to extend the three - body model so that one can consider the effect of core polarization in a consistent way .",

    "the work by varga et al .",
    "@xcite shows that core polarization does play a significant role in their microscopic cluster model calculation of the charge radius of @xmath0li .",
    "this can be seen in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where their results , with and without the effect of core polarization , are compared to the measured charge radius .",
    "a further test of such models is provided by the measured quadrupole moments of @xmath1li and @xmath0li @xcite , and by the dipole response that was extracted from coulomb dissociation data @xcite . in this connection",
    ", it would also be very useful to test the consistency of the measured charge radius and dipole response of @xmath33he because the effect of core polarization should be much smaller for an @xmath36 core .",
