    "epitaxial combination of superconducting films and ferroelectric layers is promising for construction of effective microwave devices .",
    "especially advantageous is the application of small - loss high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( ybco)@xcite and perovskite ferroelectric alloys like ba@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 ( bst ) and pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzt ) , in heterogeneous miltilayers .",
    "as both of these compounds have similar perovskite - type crystal structure with small lattice mismatch , the well oriented bst and pzt thin layers can be grown on the surfaces of ybco@xcite .",
    "in addition , the role of strains and off - stoichiometry structural defects at the bst(pzt)/ybco - interfaces can be minimized by the use of growing methods such as laser ablation for fabrication of the miltilayered structures@xcite .    since the 1960s , the strong interest in developing electric field - effect devices based on ferroelectrics has been stimulated by observations of shifts of superconducting transition temperature under a switch of the spontaneous polarization . superconducting field - effect transistors ( sufets ) can not be realized with conventional superconductors since the large coherence lengths and high carrier density of the latter result in negligibly small effect of the polarization field @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the carrier density and coherence lengths of high - t@xmath3 cuprates ( hts ) which are two orders of magnitude lower than those in conventional superconductors@xcite , have made their use in sufets very attractive @xcite .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated in ref .",
    ", that the critical temperature of ybco films could be shifted by about 6  k through the polarization in the batio@xmath2 substrate . as was assumed in @xcite , the increase of @xmath4 is connected with the formation of the accumulation layers ( with charge carrier density enhanced due to the polarization directed toward the interface ) , whereas the polarization in the opposite direction induces a depletion layer with higher resistance and lower @xmath4 .",
    "besides critical temperature , ferroelectric polarization affects transport properties of sufets leading to a change in resistance of 9 - 25  @xmath5 for pzt - ybco and pzt - ndba@xmath6cu@xmath2o@xmath7(nbco ) heterostructures @xcite and showing polarization - induced memory effects in resistance and current , which suggests their possible storage applications@xcite .    in the case when the polarization is parallel to the fe - s interface , the use of the zero-@xmath8 boundary conditions ( @xmath9 at the electrode ) results in a weak effect of the fe - layers scarcely affecting the behavior of the s - films . on the other hand , the influence of the fe - layer should be essentially strong when the fe - polarization vector @xmath10 is perpendicular to the fe - s interface .",
    "due to the specific perovskite - like structure , the properties of the high - t@xmath3 materials are believed to be very close to the perovskite - type ferroelectrics .",
    "this fact stimulated discussions about a coexistence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity and a possible ferroelectricity of hts - compounds@xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the ferroelectric polarization has been suggested to be nonzero at the interface with the hts - layer with even the possibility of penetration inside the superconductor@xcite .",
    "recent studies of ferroelectric - hts layered structures were focused on investigations of the role of free @xmath8-boundary conditions ( non - zero @xmath8 ) on dielectric properties of fe - layers@xcite .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to the behavior of superconducting films as well as to the effect of the fe - s interface on ferroelectric structural transformations .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a phenomenological model based on the ginzburg - landau theory , for the fe - layers sandwiched between superconducting films . as compared to the microscopic approach proposed in ref .",
    "where the s - layer was described as two s - planes with a possibility of a charge transfer between the planes and the interior of the layer , the proposed model allows one to study directly the behavior of the system for different thicknesses of the s - layer in the vicinity of the ferroelectric transition temperature in the fe - film , which is assumed to be close to the transition temperature of the superconductor .",
    "we note that for hts - compounds the condition @xmath11 for the ginzburg - landau theory is valid over a much wider temperature range than in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "we focus primarily on the case when the penetration depth of the polarization - induced electric field is larger than the superconducting coherence length ( @xmath12 ) , which is also typically realized in hts layers .",

    "= 8.cm      as has already been mentioned in section  [ model ] , when the ferroelectric critical temperature @xmath22 is close to @xmath4 , the phenomenological approach proposed in this work , has common key aspects with the microscopic description proposed in ref .",
    "however , while the latter model describes the superconducting layer as two boundary 2-d planes exhibiting bcs - superconductivity , the present approach allows us to study the behavior inside the thick s - layers .",
    "despite the fact that the microscopic bcs - model of ref .",
    "does not consider directly the internal processes in the superconducting layer and treats the inner part of the layer as a source for the electron transfer towards ( away from ) the boundary s - planes , the following key results appear in both approaches : + ( i ) the enhancement of the ferroelectric polarization with a formation of positive and negative @xmath8-domains above the ferroelectric transition temperature as well as for large @xmath91 and low temperatures ; + ( ii ) the suppression of the superconductivity for the strong fe - s coupling due to the ferroelectric field - type effect .",
    "+ thus , the basic structure of the phase diagrams ( @xmath91 , @xmath205 ) together with the behavior of the system in different observed phases discussed in ref .  , also retains its fundamental features in the present phenomenological approach .      the behavior of the different phases discussed above with the variation of the fe- and s - thicknesses results in different types ( from monotonous to complex nonmonotonic ) of the corresponding @xmath193 dependences .",
    "since the system properties drastically change for the large coupling @xmath245 , the @xmath16- and @xmath17-dependence of @xmath193 is also qualitatively different in the weak ( @xmath246 ) and in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath245 ) . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot several curves for various values of @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig6](inset ) and fig .",

    "[ fig6](@xmath247 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) .    depending on the value of @xmath135",
    ", we can obtain the following characteristic types of @xmath248 and @xmath249 behavior : + ( 1 ) _ for @xmath246 _ , @xmath250 decays monotonically with increasing @xmath16 to the bulk value @xmath212 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , @xmath251 in the inset ) .",
    "we note that in contrast to the model in ref .   where @xmath193 lies slightly below @xmath252 , the coupling with a s - layer of a finite thickness produces here the enhancement of the bulk - type fe+sc - phase .",
    "this corresponds to the increase of @xmath193 ( @xmath253 ) for @xmath106 ( @xmath254 ) , observed also in the phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . as a result",
    ", we also obtain that : + ( 2 ) _ for @xmath246 _ , the increase of @xmath17 produces a monotonic increase of @xmath255 , with finally approaching a saturation value which is the higher the larger @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ) .",
    "+    = 9.cm",
    "\\(3 ) _ for @xmath245 _ , the complex behavior of @xmath255 vs @xmath16 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](@xmath256 ) , is governed by a decrease of the domain phase - region as @xmath16 increases ( see the plots in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "first , for thin fe - films , the system is in the domain phase already for @xmath257 . as @xmath258 increases",
    ", the area of the domain state shrinks towards higher @xmath205 and finally disappears , which results in an increase of @xmath255 up to @xmath212 related to the transition from the fe+nm(suppressed ) to the paraelectric state ( see the corresponding diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ) .",
    "note that for a small thickness of the fe - film ( @xmath259 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the behavior of @xmath255 reflects a `` crossover '' between these two different ferroelectric transition types , namely , between the transition from the fe+nm(suppressed ) to the domain state for the thin fe - films , and the transition from the fe+nm to the paraelectric phase for the thick fe - layers .",
    "this effect is also seen in the large @xmath135-region of the diagrams plotted in fig .",
    "+ ( 4 ) fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) shows a nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath255 on @xmath17 _ for @xmath245_. as in the @xmath16-dependences , for a given value of @xmath135 at a moderate thickness @xmath260 , we find similar , but reversed `` crossover '' between the two above - mentioned different transition types .",
    "specifically , while for thin s - films , the increase of @xmath205 results in the transition from the fe+nm(suppressed ) to the paraelectric state ( at @xmath261 ) , the increase of the s - thickness induces the enhancement of the domain - type phase , leading to a lower @xmath255 ( which now corresponds to the transition between the fe+nm and the domain phases ) . see the evolution of the phase diagram topology as @xmath242 varies , shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , we note that for the larger @xmath262 the transition from the fe+nm- to the symmetric domain - state exhibits : + ( i ) monotonic decay of @xmath255 and vanishing at @xmath263 ( case @xmath264 in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) ; + ( ii ) reentrant behavior characterized by the vanishing of @xmath255 in a certain interval @xmath242 ( @xmath265 for @xmath266 in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) and finite @xmath255 otherwise ; + ( iii ) for the larger values of @xmath135 ( @xmath267 in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) , @xmath255 first decays to a finite value exhibiting a minimum at a particular @xmath17 ( @xmath268 ) , and then increases again with a further increase of the s - thickness , approaching a saturation value for thick s - layers .",
    "this behavior has a simple physical explanation : once the domain state is expanded down to @xmath133 ( yielding @xmath269 at @xmath266 and @xmath270 ) the further increase of @xmath17 for strong coupling leads to the larger spatial inhomogeneous terms in the fe - energy ( [ f_ferr ] ) , which results in a slight enhancement of the suppressed state towards higher @xmath205 and as a result , to an increase of @xmath255 ( see the two phase diagrams for @xmath271 and @xmath272 shown in fig .  [ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "in this paper we have developed a phenomenological model describing periodic ferroelectric - superconductor multilayers .",
    "this model generalizes in some aspects the microscopic approach proposed in ref .   where the superconducting layers are represented by two planes with a possibility of charge transfer between the planes and the interior of the layer .",
    "we analyze here the case when the ferroelectric transition temperature lies below the temperature of the transition to the superconducting state ( @xmath117 ) which is realized in some complex insulating perovskite alloys such as ba@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 ( bst ) coupled to high - temperature superconductors . similarly to the microscopic model , we observe the stabilization of the symmetric domain - type phase exhibiting a weak polarization due to the fe - s contacts above the bulk ferroelectric transition temperature . on the other hand , we find the polarization - induced suppression of the superconductivity in the s - layer .",
    "we show that the ultimate reason for the destruction of the superconducting state for strong fe - s coupling , is the increase of the contribution of the spatial inhomogeneities to the energy of the system .",
    "we study the behavior for different thicknesses of the fe and s - layer demonstrating the strong change of the topology of the phase diagrams ( @xmath135 , @xmath198 ) with a variation of @xmath258 and @xmath242 .    in general , we find several types of @xmath248 and @xmath249 behavior .",
    "for the weak fe - s coupling , @xmath246 , we obtain a monotonic variation of @xmath193 , with approaching saturation value in the system with the thick fe or s - layer .",
    "in contrast to this , for the strong coupling , @xmath245 , the dependence of @xmath193 vs layer thicknesses appears to be highly nonmonotonic due to the competition between the first tendency to expand the domain state ( prevailing for the thick s - layers ) and the second tendency to destroy the superconductivity dominating for the thicker fe - layers .",
    "this work has been supported by the schwerpunktprogramm of the german science foundation ( deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ) under grant no .",
    "let us consider in more details the superconducting layer without a magnetic field .",
    "the general form of the ginzburg - landau functional in the s - layer can be written as @xmath274,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath275 .",
    "note that in the obtained in this case boundary conditions the terms containing @xmath273 and @xmath280 appear with the opposite signs and thus cancel , resulting in the standard form given by ( [ bz_l1 ] ) and ( [ bz_l ] ) in the paper .    from ( [ gl_a ] )",
    "we immediately obtain that the single possible solution for @xmath273 is : @xmath281 we assume here for simplicity the absence of the tunneling current through the insulating fe - layer , which corresponds to the zero phase difference on the contacts between the s - films : @xmath282 and leads to the constant phase in the whole system : @xmath283 . as the result , we get from ( [ gl_a ] ) @xmath284 and the next two equations transform into the equation ( [ g_lan_eq2 ] ) for the absolute value of the superconducting order parameter @xmath34 .",
