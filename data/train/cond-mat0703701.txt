    "in many transport phenomena such as those taking place in biological cells , ion channels , nano - porous materials and microfluidic devices etched with grooves and chambers , brownian particles , instead of diffusing freely in the host liquid phase , undergo a constrained motion .",
    "the uneven shape of these structures regulates the transport of particles yielding important effects exhibiting peculiar properties .",
    "the results have implications in processes such as catalysis , osmosis and particle separation @xcite and for the noise - induced transport in periodic potential landscapes that lack reflection symmetry ( ratchet systems ) @xcite or ratchet transport mechanisms which are based on asymmetric geometries , termed `` entropic '' ratchet devices @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been found that the separation of dna fragments in narrow channels @xcite is largely influenced by their shape .",
    "the translocation of structured polynucleotides through nanopores also allows one to determine their sequence and structure @xcite .",
    "the motion of the particles through these quasi - one - dimensional structures can in principle be analyzed by means of the standard protocol of solving the smoluchowski equation with the appropriate boundary conditions imposed .",
    "whereas this method has been very successful when the boundaries of the system possess a regular shape , the challenge to solve the boundary value problem in the case of uneven boundaries represents typically a very difficult task . a way to circumvent this difficulty consists in coarsening the description by reducing the dimensionality of the system , keeping only the main direction of transport , but taking into account the irregular nature of these boundaries by means of an entropic potential .",
    "the resulting kinetic equation for the probability distribution , the fick - jacobs ( f - j ) equation , is similar in form to the smoluchowski equation , but now contains an entropic term .",
    "the entropic nature of this term leads to a genuine dynamics which is very different from that observed when the potential has an energetic origin @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the f - j equation can provide a very accurate description of entropic transport in 2d and 3d channels of varying cross - section @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation of the f - j equation entails a tacit approximation : the particle distribution in the transverse direction is assumed to equilibrate much faster than in the main ( unconstrained ) direction of transport .",
    "this equilibration justifies the coarsening of the description leading in turn to a simplification of the dynamics , but raises the question about its validity when an _ external force is applied_. to establish the validity criterion of a f - j description for such biased diffusion in confined media is , due to the ubiquity of this situation , a subject of primary importance .",
    "our objective with this work is to investigate in greater detail the f - j approximation for biased diffusion and to set up a corresponding criterion describing its regime of validity .",
    "we will analyze the biased movement of brownian particles in 2d and 3d periodic channels of varying cross section and formulate different criteria for the validity of such a f - j description .",

    "in the absence of an external force , i.e. when @xmath27 , it was shown @xcite that the dynamics of particles in confined structures ( such as that of fig .  [",

    "note that eq .   may typically describe the time - evolution of a 1d particle distribution within an energy landscape . in the present context",

    ", we deal with a pure entropic situation with the free energy reading @xmath45 .",

    "the reduction of dimensionality done implicitly in the formulation of the f - j equation relies on the assumption of equilibration in the transverse direction .",
    "an estimate of the conditions under which equilibration occurs can be made by analyzing the different time scales involved in the problem . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us focus on the situation of a 2d channel , although the same discussion can readily be extended to 3d . in a 2d channel in the presence of an external force , in the axial direction",
    ", one can identify three characteristic processes , with the corresponding different time scales .",
    "one is diffusion in the transverse direction over a distance @xmath66 , whose time scale is @xmath67    similarly , the time scale associated to diffusion in the axial direction is    @xmath68    the third time scale is defined through the characteristic time associated to the drift ( ballistic motion ) over a distance @xmath69 given by @xmath70 where we have used the scaling factor @xmath71 . rearranging the previous expression ,",
    "we obtain @xmath72    in order to have a good equilibration in the transverse direction , the characteristic time scale associated to diffusion in this direction has to be much smaller than the other two time scales .",
    "therefore , in the absence of an external force , equilibration in the transverse direction occurs if @xmath73 .",
    "this results in the condition : @xmath74 which constitutes the validity criterion of the f - j approach such as put forward by zwanzig @xcite .    in presence of a force along the axis , equilibration in the transverse direction demands that the condition @xmath75 also holds .",
    "consequently , @xmath76 where in the second step we have replaced the characteristic distances @xmath66 by the width @xmath77 , and @xmath69 by @xmath19 .",
    "a general estimate of the criteria that has to be satisfied is that @xmath78 .",
    "an even stronger criteria in order for the f - j description to hold in presence of a constant force can be put forward by considering the sum of the two ratios , cf .",

    "note also that this is a _ local _ criterion , i.e. for a given channel , there would be regions ( associated to drastic changes in the shape of the channel , i.e @xmath80 ) where equilibration in the transverse direction is not feasible , whereas in others is fulfilled .",
    "it is then more convenient to work with a _ global criterion _ of validity rather than with a local one .",
    "one way of getting that global condition is by averaging the local criterion over the period @xmath19 of the channel , yielding one of our main results : @xmath81    in order to get an explicit estimate of the dependence of the maximum force value on the periodicity @xmath19 of the channel , we define a critical force value @xmath82 , for which the inequality   becomes an equality , i.e. @xmath83 . then the critical force value reads : @xmath84 which indicates that the critical force scales asymptotically as @xmath85 , if we fix the overall shape of the channel and change only its periodicity .",

    "<S> we study biased , diffusive transport of brownian particles through narrow , spatially periodic structures in which the motion is constrained in lateral directions . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is analyzed under the perspective of the fick - jacobs equation which accounts for the effect of the lateral confinement by introducing an entropic barrier in a one dimensional diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this approximation , being based on the assumption of an instantaneous equilibration of the particle distribution in the cross - section of the structure , is analyzed by comparing the different time scales that characterize the problem . </S>",
    "<S> a validity criterion is established in terms of the shape of the structure and of the applied force . </S>",
    "<S> it is analytically corroborated and verified by numerical simulations that the critical value of the force up to which this description holds true scales as the _ square _ of the periodicity of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion can be visualized by means of a diagram representing the regions where the fick - jacobs description becomes inaccurate in terms of the scaled force versus the periodicity of the structure . </S>"
