    "<S> the microwave properties of a crystalline sapphire dielectric whispering gallery mode resonator have been measured at very low excitation strength ( @xmath0 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath1 mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were sensitive enough to observe saturation due to a highly detuned electron spin resonance , which limited the loss tangent of the material to about @xmath2 measured at 13.868 and 13.259 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> small power dependent frequency shifts were also measured which correspond to an added magnetic susceptibility of order 10@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that quantum limited microwave resonators with @xmath4-factors @xmath5 are possible with the implementation of a sapphire whispering gallery mode system .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystal sapphire resonators ( @xmath6-al@xmath7o@xmath8 ) are particularly useful in a range of precision microwave experiments due to their extremely low dielectric loss tangent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> key to the operation of cryogenic devices is the very high electronic @xmath4-factors of larger than @xmath9 in whispering gallery ( wg ) modes at liquid helium temperature , which operate typically at input powers of order 1 mw or above . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the bulk electronic properties of sapphire have been characterized extensively over a wide range of temperatures from room to superfluid liquid helium temperatures using the wg mode technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently we extended these tests to temperatures as low as 25 mk , publishing the first observation of electromagnetically induced thermal bistabilty in bulk sapphire due to the material @xmath10 dependence on thermal conductivity and the ultra - low dielectric loss tangent @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> schematic of the set - up to measure q - factor and frequency at low temperature and low input power.,width=239 ]    in recent years , martinis et al . </S>",
    "<S> have shown that dielectric loss from ubiquitous two - level fluctuators , whether they be material defects , microscopic degrees of freedom , or otherwise , is a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in josephson junction qubits , dielectric loss in the insulating layer can lead to short coherence times and thus it is very important to improve this parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the loss is well modelled by resonant absorption of  two level states \" ( tls ) . </S>",
    "<S> longer coherence times can be achieved in part by selecting or engineering insulating materials with superior dielectric loss tangent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low loss tangent of monolithic sapphire is well known , but has typically been measured in a high power regime ( @xmath11 to + 20 dbm ) at which tls are saturated . in this summary , we report on the first measurements of sapphire @xmath4-factor at single photon input powers ( @xmath12 dbm at 13 ghz ) to determine the suitability for use in quantum measurement applications .    </S>",
    "<S> a highest purity hemex - grade sapphire resonator ( 5 cm diameter , 3 cm height ) was mounted in a silver - plated copper cavity , and affixed to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator and cooled to 25 mk . </S>",
    "<S> a network analyser , locked to a high - stability quartz reference , was used to generate a microwave signal , which was heavily attenuated , injected into the resonator , and amplified back to detectable levels . </S>",
    "<S> the q - factor of the whispering gallery modes wgh@xmath13 and wgh@xmath14 were measured at a range of temperatures and input powers .        as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] , 50 db of attenuation was attached to the input line in the cryogenic environment ( at or below 4 k ) , and an additional 40 db of attenuation was attached at room temperature outside the fridge . </S>",
    "<S> the loss in the cables between the network analyser and the input probe of the cavity was nominally 7 db , and the coupling of the probe of 0.02 leads to a further loss of 16.99 db . </S>",
    "<S> hence the power at the resonator was adjusted in the analysis to account for an additional 24 db loss ( not marked as attenuation on the schematic in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] ) . on the output line , 35 db of amplification </S>",
    "<S> was inserted within the cryogenic environment , a commercial device from jpl , model r3c3m1 cit-4254 - 077 ( 0.5 - 11 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> a second 35 db amplifier was inserted at room temperature , low noise factory model lnf - lnr1 - 11b ( 1 - 11 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the resonant modes of interest were in the region of 12 - 14 ghz , whereas the cryogenic amplifiers were specified for operation below this range . </S>",
    "<S> the gain was nominally unaffected , however the noise figure almost doubled at these higher frequencies , severely degrading the signal to noise ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> the q - factors were determined by fitting a fano resonance @xcite ( lorentzian profile with an asymmetry factor ) to each curve and extracting the linewidth and centre frequency , from which @xmath4 can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> note that at low input powers , signal to noise was degraded and all fits show the standard error ( snr=1 ) calculated from the fano resonance fits , which clearly increases at low input powers . </S>",
    "<S> the q - factor and frequency shift were measured as a function of input power for two modes : @xmath15 ( @xmath1613.259 ghz ) , and @xmath17 ( @xmath1613.869 ghz ) at 27mk and 200mk respectively , and is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] . because the signal - to - noise ratio degrades with incident power , a noticeable increase in the standard error of the @xmath4 and frequency determination </S>",
    "<S> is observed at powers below -115 dbm . at higher powers ( greater than 1 mw ) </S>",
    "<S> , the biggest effects on mode frequency and @xmath4-factor have previously been shown to be due to residual paramagnetic impurities such as fe@xmath18 , cr@xmath18 and ti@xmath18 of order parts per billion to part per million @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility added by these impurities may create frequency - temperature turnover points , which make possible the production of stable frequencies by implementing a high-@xmath4 sapphire whispering gallery mode resonator as the frequency - determining device in an active system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , high-@xmath4 cryogenic masers based on concentrations of only parts - per - billion of paramagnetic impurities have been created . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when a wg mode is tuned to an electron spin resonance in sapphire such as the fe@xmath18 resonance at 12.04 ghz , large saturation effects are observed and if one pumps at a higher frequency population inversion is created and masing occurs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these results use the same maser sapphire crystal in bourgeois et al.@xcite , which means that we are most likely interacting with an extremely small number of fe@xmath18 ions in the tail resonance at 12.04 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility change upon saturation may be calculated using : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the magnetic filling factor , and @xmath21 the fractional frequency shift ( which in general is complex ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives , for example , susceptibility of order several times 10@xmath3 at very low incident power , which begins to saturate at about -90 dbm and achieves full saturation at -60 dbm as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in @xmath4-factor is thus due to an extra component of magnetic loss ( or imaginary susceptibility ) supplied by the paramagnetic impurity as a function of input power . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the calculated electric and magnetic field strength within the resonator as a function of the magnetic loss tangent . </S>",
    "<S> this achieved using a separation of variables technique to determine the mode field patterns @xcite , then using standard relations that express the electric and magnetic field energy stored in the resonator to the parameters of the resonator , such as input power @xmath4-factor , filling factors and couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> as the power decreases , @xmath4-factors drop by a factor of between 2 and 10 but remain as high as several hundred million . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the effect is magnetic , as parametric ions at parts per billion have a dominant effect at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> even a long way from the electron spin resonance we see small effects by virtue of the high precision of these measurements . typically , susceptibility of parts in 10@xmath3 added by a detuned esr is normal , which is saturated at higher power . </S>",
    "<S> as the power decreases , the loss tangent tends towards a value of several times 10@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> several factors in the experimental setup limited the quality of results , the most significant being the use of a cryogenic amplifier out of its specified range resulting a reduced signal - to - noise ratio and thus a reduced accuracy of @xmath4 determination for the lowest power measurements , hence the large error bars representing the standard error of the fit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we have shown that high @xmath4-factors of parts in 10@xmath22 are possible at the energies of a single photon and at milli - kelvin temperature , which could be useful for a host of quantum measurement applications . </S>"
