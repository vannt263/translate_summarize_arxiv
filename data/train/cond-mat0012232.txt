    "the problem of adsorption of an ideal heteropolymer chain with random quenched chemical structure ( i.e. sequence of links ) is far from being new and is well represented in the literature .",
    "the simple diffusive approach @xcite provides us complete understanding of the homopolymer and block  copolymers adsorption in various geometries .",
    "more advanced renormalization group methods @xcite and power series analysis @xcite applied to random chains with a disordered sequence of links delivers an important information about the thermodynamic properties of ideal polymers near the transition point from delocalized ( gaussian ) to localized ( adsorbed ) regimes . a mathematical formalism based on perturbation theory",
    "gives reasonable results for a phase transition in solid  on  solid ( sos ) models with quenched impurities @xcite .",
    "many conclusions of @xcite correlate with those obtained by rg analysis in @xcite .",
    "problems dealing with localization of disordered polymers at selective interfaces @xcite should be also mentioned in the context of discussed problems .",
    "however even since early 80s during almost 20 years of intent attention some important questions of heteropolymer adsorption remain still open .",
    "one of them , the most intriguing , to our point of view , concerns the location of a point of a phase transition from coil to localized ( adsorbed at a potential well ) state .    in this paper",
    "we consider the model of an ideal , i.e. self  intersecting _ ring _ polymer chain consisting of two types of links , `` black '' and `` white '' organized in different chemical structures having different energies in the single point ",
    "like potential well .",
    "we distinguish between the following models of chemical structures :    1 .   _",
    "`` canonically quenched '' _ sequence  positions of `` black '' and `` white '' links are uniquely fixed for a given chain structure and can not exchange in course of chain fluctuations ; the chemical structure is prepared from `` black '' and `` white '' links at random with prescribed probabilities .",
    "_ `` microcanonically quenched '' _ sequence  positions of `` black '' and `` white '' links are again uniquely fixed for a given chain structure and satisfy an extra constraint : the total number of `` black '' and `` white '' links per chain is conserved for all realizations of chain structures .",
    "our consideration is semi - analytical / semi - numerical .",
    "namely , the closure of an ideal @xmath0link chain in a ring enables us to integrate from the very beginning over all space degrees of freedom for quenched sequences of links and explicitly rewrite the green s function of a chain as a quotient of determinants of two @xmath1matrices with random coefficients on the main diagonals .",
    "the transition point corresponds to the situation when the denominator of the quotient becomes zero .",
    "this last question for large @xmath0 and different models of chemical structures is analyzed numerically .",
    "the results are exposed in a form of histograms showing how many sequences have the transition points at a given energy . choosing the sequences which have the transition points in the tail of the histogram we found that these sequences have effective correlations between nearest ",
    "neighbor monomers for the model ( 2 ) and do not exhibit any correlations for the model ( 1 ) .",
    "consider an @xmath0link ideal ( i.e. self  intersecting ) gaussian polymer chain in @xmath2dimensional space .",
    "suppose that the chain forms a ring and attach the first and the last chain s segments to the origin .",
    "all segments are painted in `` black '' or `` white '' colors , designating different interaction energies with the potential well located at the origin .",
    "there is no interaction of chain s links between themselves or between a link and any point in @xmath2dimensional space distinct from the origin . increasing the interaction energy",
    ", we could provoke the transition from extended ( coil ) to localized ( adsorbed ) state of the macromolecule .",
    "the transition is governed by the interplay between entropic forces tending to expel the chain and contact potential interactions which gain the energy in a compact polymer configuration .",
    "the said above can be easily rewritten in a formal way .",
    "let us introduce the joint distribution function @xmath3 having sense of a probability that the links with numbers @xmath4 of the @xmath0step chain are located at the points @xmath5 in @xmath2dimensional space .",
    "the markov structure of our polymer chain ensures the presence of correlation only between the neighboring segments of length @xmath6 and allows us to set @xmath7 where the transition probability @xmath8 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath9 and for simplicity is supposed to be gaussian : [ eq:1 ] g(*x*)=()^d/2 e^- the green s function @xmath10 is defined as follows [ eq:2 ] g(*x*_n , n)=_i=1^n d^dx_1 ... d^dx_n-1 . where @xmath11 is the boltzmann weight of @xmath12 chain segment in the potential well at the origin ( compare to @xcite ) : [ eq:3 ] e^-(*x*_i)/t=1+_i(*x*_i ) ; _ i=\\ {    ll e^-u_b-1 & @xmath13 + e^-u_w-1 & @xmath14    . and @xmath15 is the dimensionless energy ( everywhere below we set @xmath16 ) .",
    "now we can write the recursion equation for the green s function ( [ eq:2 ] ) , expressing @xmath17 in terms of @xmath18 and corresponding boltzman weights for @xmath19 . performing fourier transform and taking into account ( [ eq:3 ] )",
    "we arrive at the following integral equation in the momentum space [ eq:4 ] g(*k*,i+1 ) = g(*k*)g(*k*,i ) + ( 2)^-d _ i+1g(*k*)g(*k*,i)d^dk where [ eq:5 ] g(*k*)=e^-|*k*|^2 a^2/2d in order to make the system of equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) closed and nonuniform we should take into account the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "let us point out that for open chains the precise form of initial and boundary conditions does not affect in the thermodynamic limit the phase transition point ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the same we expect also for closed chains .",
    "suppose that the last segment ( with @xmath20 ) is linked to the origin by some sufficiently weak dimensionless potential @xmath21 . without the loss of generality we may chose @xmath21 in the simplest form : @xmath22 .",
    "the presence of the potential @xmath21 increases the probability @xmath23 to find the @xmath0 s chain link near the origin .",
    "if @xmath24 we may set in the linear approximation : [ eq:6a ] ( * k*,i = n)=g(*k*,i = n)+f using the fact that the chain is closed , we complete equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) by the following one : [ eq:6b ] g(*k*,i=1)=g(*k*)(*k*,i = n ) + ( 2)^-d_1g(*k*)(*k*,i = n)d^dk ( as we shall see later @xmath21 does not enter the final expression for the transition point ) .    the system of @xmath0 equations ( [ eq:4])([eq:6b ] ) is closed .",
    "this enables us to write it as a single _ matrix  integral _ equation for the @xmath0component `` spinor '' green s function @xmath25 .",
    "hence we get : [ eq:7 ] * g*(*k*)= g(*k*)*g*(*k*)+ ( 2)^-dg(*k*)*g*(*k*)d^dk+ * f*(*k * ) with [ eq:8 ] =(    ccccc 0 & 0 & 0 &  & 1 + 1 & 0 & 0 &  & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 &  & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 &  & 0 + & & & &    ) , =(    cccccc _ 1 & 0 & 0 &  & 0 + 0 & _ 2 & 0 &  & 0 + 0 & 0 & _ 3 &  & 0 + & & & & + 0 & 0 & 0 &  & _ n    ) , and ( * k*)=((g(*k*)+(d/2a^2)^2)f,0 ,  , 0)^t    let us rearrange the terms in ( [ eq:7 ] ) as follows [ eq:9 ] * g*(*k*)= ( -g(*k*))^-1 where @xmath26 is @xmath1 identity matrix . integrating l.h.s and r.h.s of ( [ eq:9 ] ) with the weight @xmath27 over all @xmath28 , we arrive at the _ algebraic matrix _ equation for the function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 : [ eq:10 ] * a*=(2)^-d + * f *    the straightforward computations show that the @xmath1 matrix @xmath31 has the form : [ eq:11 ] =(    lllll _ 2 c_1 & _ 3 c_2 & _ 4 c_3 &  & _ 1 c_n + _ 2 c_n & _ 3 c_1 & _ 4 c_2 &  & _ 1 c_n-1 + _ 2 c_n-1 & _ 3 c_n & _ 4 c_1 &  & _ 1 c_n-2 + & & & & + _ 2 c_2 & _ 3 c_3 & _ 4 c_4 &  & _ 1 c_1    ) with the coefficients [ eq:12 ] c_ic_i(*k*)=- , iand the vector @xmath32 has components f_i= ( g(*k*)+(d/2a^2)^2 ) c_n - i+1(*k * ) d^dk    hence the vector @xmath33 obeys the system of equations [ eq:13 ] \\ {    llllllllllllll a_1 & = & _ 2 a_1 a_1 & + & _ 3 a_2 a_2 & + & ... & + & _",

    "this is consistent with the statement on independence of the point of 2nd order phase transition on the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interesting feature of ( [ eq : beta4 ] ) consists in the fact that the value @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath0 for ring chains .",
    "in this section we solve numerically eq.([eq:19 ] ) for two different types of bimodal distribution of links with @xmath46 : ( 1 ) canonically quenched and ( 2 ) microcanonically quenched .",

    "the results of our simulations are displayed in fig.[fig:2]a , where the chain lengths @xmath0 have varied in the interval @xmath67 .",

    "the results of our numerical simulations of eq.([eq:19 ] ) permit us to conclude that within the standard error the mean values of phase transition energies @xmath63 and @xmath76 in chains with symmetric bimodal canonically and microcanonically quenched sequences tend to one and the same value @xmath77 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "at the same time the transition point in an effective homopolymer chain defined by eq.([eq : effhom ] ) is @xmath78 .",
    "these numerical results seem to be sufficiently strong to conjecture the difference between the mean value of transition point for ensembles of heteropolymers with quenched sequences of links and the transition point in an effective homopolymer chain .",
    "however one should honestly say that the expressed conjecture deserves more investigation and still can not be considered as a rigorous statement .",
    "the reason why we can not regard it yet as an exact one is as follows .",
    "we have analyzed the distribution of transition points in sufficiently long but finite chains ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath80 the transition region for finite @xmath0 .",
    "as we know from the theory of 2nd order phase transitions @xcite , [ eq : concl1 ] u_fin(n)~n^-1/2 as @xmath45 due to the _ finiteness _ of @xmath0 for homopolymer chains .    \\2 .",
    "the quenched randomness in types of links leads to an extra uncertainty in the location of a transition point for heteropolymer chains .",
    "the transition region @xmath81 due to the _ randomness _ in sequences of links can be estimated by the width of the histograms ",
    "see fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "so , we may set [ eq : concl2 ] u_ran(n)~ \\ {        the behavior ( [ eq : concl2 ] ) is consistent with general self  averaging hypothesis for disordered systems @xcite claiming the existence of unique transition point for _ every _ disordered sequence in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath82    considering ( [ eq : concl1 ] ) and ( [ eq : concl2 ] ) as independent contributions we arrive at the statement on the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "however one can not exclude the possible `` interference '' between ( [ eq : concl1 ] ) and ( [ eq : concl2 ] ) which may lead to the smearing of the transition region .",
    "this last possibility is not analyzed yet .",
    "moreover , the asymptotics ( [ eq : concl2 ] ) is based on the interpolation of numerical results for finite @xmath0 to @xmath45 .",
    "the importance of ( [ eq : concl2 ] ) deserves an analytic support of our conclusion .      the data of our numerical simulations stored",
    "in course of the construction of the histograms ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) allow us to regard the following problem .",
    "let us define the correlation function @xmath85 for each ring chain [ eq : concl3 ] = _ j=1^n-1 _ j _ j+1 where the sum runs along all the chain s segments @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87    knowing the transition point ( the solution of eq.([eq:19 ] ) ) for every of @xmath57 sequences ( for both of models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) , let us assign to each sequence the point in the coordinates @xmath88 on the plane .",
    "the corresponding `` spots '' for the models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are shown in fig.[fig:3]a , b for @xmath89 .",
    "these figures are lead to the following important conclusions .",
    "there are no essential visible correlations between nearest ",
    "neighbor links in the ensemble of canonically quenched sequences what is manifested in the fact that the corresponding `` spot '' is circular  see fig.[fig:3]a .    \\2 .",
    "there are correlations between nearest - neighbor links in the ensemble of microcanonically quenched sequences what is manifested in the fact that the corresponding `` spot '' is asymmetric .",
    "moreover , the figure [ fig:3]b allows to conclude how the primary structure of the heteropolymer chain is organized : the positive correlations @xmath90 for @xmath91 show the preferable clustering in the subsequences of the same color , while the negative correlations @xmath92 for @xmath93 show the preferable mixing of opposite colors .",
    "thus , knowing the value of the transition point for the chain of `` microcanonically quenched ensemble '' we can make an approximate conclusion about the primary sequence of monomers in a given chain .",
    "the fact that the width of the histogram shrinks to zero at @xmath45 means that apparently at @xmath45 the corresponding `` spot '' in fig.[fig:3]b becomes more and more symmetric and the nontrivial correlations disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however every real physical polymer system consists of finite number of monomers what means that the above mentioned effect should in principle exist .",
    "we expect that the approach proposed in the present work turns the initial problem into well  posed subject of statistical theory of random matrices , what would allow to apply the standard methods of random matrix theory for heteropolymer adsorption .",
