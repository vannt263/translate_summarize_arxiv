    "ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at sps and rhic energies ( @xmath1 agev ) provided an enormous volume of experimental data on particle production  @xcite . the microscopic mechanisms of hadron production are not fully understood and many different descriptions coexist to explain these data .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons have been measured in a wide momentum region ( e.g. @xmath2 gev at rhic ) , and can become a decisive test between different perturbative and non - perturbative models of hadron formation .",
    "investigations of @xmath3 collisions at high energies led to the introduction of chromoelectric flux tube ( string ) models , where these tubes are connecting the quark and diquark constituents of colliding protons  @xcite .",
    "strings are good examples of how to convert the kinetic energy of a collision into field energy .",
    "when these flux tubes become unstable , new hadrons will be produced via quark - antiquark and diquark - antidiquark pair production .",
    "such models can describe experimental data successfully at low @xmath0 , @xmath4 gev . at higher @xmath0",
    "perturbative qcd - based models are working  @xcite .    in heavy ion reactions",
    "finite number of nucleons collide and the number of produced strings scales with the number of participant nucleons . since hadron production at low @xmath0 scales with participant nucleons in a wide energy range , string models could reproduce available data surprisingly well in the soft region at sps energies  @xcite .",
    "however , the obtained high density for strings strengthened the idea of string melting and the formation of color ropes  @xcite , which fill the finite transverse extension partially or completely . following these ideas ,",
    "measured strangeness enhancement was explained successfully by rope formation  @xcite .",
    "this result has indicated the possible formation of extended color fields at sps energies .    at rhic and lhc energies",
    "the string density is expected to be so large that a strong gluon field will be formed in the whole available transverse volume .",
    "furthermore , the gluon number will be so high that a classical gluon field as the expectation value of the quantum field can be considered and investigated in the reaction volume .",
    "the properties of such non - abelian classical fields and details of gluon production were studied very intensively during the last years , especially asymptotic solutions  @xcite .",
    "fermion production was calculated recently  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations were performed also to describe strong classical fields under finite space - time conditions  @xcite .",
    "fermion pair production together with boson pair production were investigated by kinetic models of particle production from strong abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite fields .",
    "these calculations concentrated mostly on bulk properties , the time dependence of energy and particle number densities .",
    "our main interest is the transverse momentum distribution of produced fermions and bosons . before performing non - abelian kinetic model calculation , we would like to understand the role of time dependence , the interplay between production and annihilation rates in a kinetic approach and the influence of finite transverse size on the transverse momentum distributions .    in this paper",
    "we summarize our results applying a kinetic model with a time - dependent abelian external field characterized by finite transverse geometry .",
    "we concentrate on transverse momentum spectra for produced particles .",
    "section 2 summarizes the field theoretical backgrounds for boson and fermion production in strong abelian field .",
    "the kinetic equation is explained briefly in section 3 . in section 4",
    "the influence of time dependence on fermionic and bosonic transverse momentum spectra is displayed and the obtained results are compared to lattice calculations . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "let us consider a massive boson field @xmath5 in an external classical abelian vector field , @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath7 leads to the equation of motion @xmath8 where @xmath9 with bosonic charge @xmath10 .",
    "the bosonic mass is labelled by @xmath11 .",
    "we will choose a longitudinally dominant vector field in hamilton gauge with the 4-potential @xmath12 which is the most appropriate for our investigation in the ultrarelativistic energy region .    to imitate confinement properties of yang - mills fields ,",
    "the component @xmath13 is limited in the transverse direction , and a finite flux tube radius @xmath14 is considered .",
    "the external field is cylindrically symmetric .",
    "it vanishes outside the tube , @xmath15 , and it is homogeneous inside the flux tube , @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the klein - gordon equation ( [ kleing ] ) reads for the boson field @xmath17 as @xmath18 \\phi= 0 \\ , \\label{transkg}\\ ] ] where the transverse laplace operator is given by @xmath19 for the bosonic field function in eq.([transkg ] ) we are looking for the following solution : @xmath20 one equation is obtained for the time - dependent part , @xmath21t(t)=0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and one for the spatial dependence , @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the separation constant which will be fixed later .",
    "considering flux - tube boundary condition for @xmath24 and the constraint @xmath25 on the surface of the flux tube , the solution for the boson field is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 zero of the bessel function @xmath29 and the constant @xmath30 appears during the normalization of the field function .",
    "the energy of the bosonic quasiparticles reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kinetic longitudinal momenta and @xmath33 labels the discrete transverse momenta . in section 3 the transverse momenta spectra of the newly produced bosons",
    "will be determined at these discrete transverse momentum values , @xmath33 .",
    "massive fermions ( @xmath34 ) can be described similarly in the presence of the above external classical abelian field @xmath35 . considering the fermionic lagrangian @xmath36 one obtains the corresponding equation of motion @xmath37 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ferm0 ] ) is wanted in the form of @xmath38 where an auxiliary field @xmath39 was introduced @xcite . in the cylindrically symmetric case ,",
    "one obtains the following equation for @xmath40 : @xmath41 { \\widehat \\psi}= 0 \\ .",

    "thus , one obtains @xmath47 and the same radial solutions with the same separation constants @xmath48 as above .",
    "the one - particle energy for the auxiliary field is the following : @xmath49 here @xmath50 labels longitudinal time - dependent component @xmath51 satisfies the equation @xmath52 { \\widehat t}(t)=0 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using eq.([ferm1 ] ) for the solution of the auxiliary field , one can reconstruct the fermion field @xmath53 . the dispersion relation in eq.([dispf ] ) remains valid for these fermions .",
    "the finite radius of the flux tube determines a minimal transverse energy , @xmath54 . for @xmath3 collisions we obtain @xmath55 , for central @xmath56 collisions it is @xmath57 , which are very small , but nonzero values .",
    "the kinetic equation with time - dependent external field can be constructed on the basis of the calculated bosonic and fermionic field functions . using a time - dependent bogoliubov transformation approach",
    "( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) or a quasiparticle representation approach  @xcite , one obtains the following kinetic equation : @xmath58 here @xmath59 .",
    "one - particle distribution functions for bosons(@xmath60 ) and fermions(@xmath61 ) are labelled by @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the measurable longitudinal momentum of the produced particle has the value of @xmath63 .",
    "equation ( [ ke ] ) will be solved at the discrete transverse momenta @xmath48 , which depend on the transverse radius ( @xmath14 ) of the chromoelectric field .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ ke ] ) can be solved at continuous transverse momenta and the solutions at corresponding @xmath48 will be selected .",
    "the source term @xmath64 contains information about the time evolution of the system and is determined as @xmath65   \\cos \\left [ { 2 \\int\\limits_{t ' } ^t { d \\tau } \\ { \\overline \\omega}_{\\pm}(t , \\tau ; k_3)}\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\   & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66^{2s_\\pm}\\ , . \\ \\ \\label{wpm }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    overlined notation indicates appropriate asymptotic behavior , namely @xmath67 .",
    "similar asymptotics are valid for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the difference in boson and fermion production appears through the spin factor in eq .",
    "( [ wpm ] ) , namely @xmath70 for bosons and @xmath71 for fermions .",
    "now we introduce new auxiliary functions , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and rewrite the integro - differential eq.([ke ] ) in a more convenient form containing full derivatives : @xmath74 this system of differential equations is solved for all sets of @xmath75 , which correspond to the different transverse and longitudinal momenta .",
    "the functions @xmath76 start with zero initial value , describing a system without any bosons or fermions at the beginning . assuming different time dependences for the external field , @xmath77",
    ", we obtain different particle productions .",
    "we would like to note that produced charged particles generate an inner field which interferes with the external one  @xcite .",
    "this effect is neglected here , as well as a possible collision term , @xmath78 , on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ke ] )  @xcite .",
    "a given external field can mimic a certain self - consistent solution as expansion , collision or back reaction influenced time dependence of the field .",
    "in heavy ion collisions , one can assume three different types of time dependence for the chromoelectric field to be formed : a ) pulse - like field develops with a fast increase , which is followed by a fast fall in the field strength ; b ) formation of a constant field ( @xmath79 ) is maintained after the fast increase in the initial time period ; c ) scaled decrease of the field strength appears , which is caused by particle production and/or transverse expansion , and the decrease is elongated in time much further than the pulse - like assumption .",
    "figure  [ etime ] displays three sets for the time dependence of the external field to investigate the above three different physical scenarios numerically : @xmath80   \\hspace*{0.6truecm }    & \\label{ep } \\\\",

    "in fact , the whole time dependence is scaled by @xmath84 .",
    "figures [ bostime ] and [ fertime ] display the obtained transverse momentum spectra in midrapidity at time @xmath85 for bosons and fermions .",
    "pulse - type time dependence leads to exponential spectra ( _ dotted lines _ ) , @xmath86 , where the slope value is @xmath87 for bosons and @xmath88 for fermions . in the other two cases , we obtain non - exponential spectra , which are generated by the long - lived electric field .",
    "the transverse spectra from constant ( _ dashed lines _ ) and scaled ( _ solid lines _ ) fields are close , because the production and annihilation rates balance each other .",
    "slight differences appear because of the fast fall of the scaled field immediately after @xmath89 .",
    "we note here , that indeed we have discrete transverse momenta , @xmath48 , but with such small steps , which allow us to display continuous transverse momentum spectra .    comparing the boson and fermion production in midrapidity",
    ", one can recognize the large difference in the production rates and see a clear fermion dominance at all transverse momenta .",
    "the reason of this dominance can be understood from fig .",
    "4 , which displays the longitudinal particle spectra , @xmath90 , at fixed transverse momenta , @xmath91 , and time , @xmath92 . fermion spectra ( thick line ) have a reasonable value around zero longitudinal momenta ( which means midrapidity ) , but boson spectra ( thin line ) display a dip-like structure here .",
    "the presence of this dip is related to the structure of the transition rate @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ wpm ] ) and the longitudinal dominance of the electric field defined via @xmath24 : at zero longitudinal momenta ( @xmath63 ) there is no boson production , but fermion production is characterized by a well defined finite value .    at extremely high - energy heavy ion collisions",
    "we expect this longitudinal dominance of the chromoelectric field .",
    "if transverse electric field components become comparable to the longitudinal one at lower energies , then the boson yield will be much larger .",
    "the presence of scattering term , @xmath94 , can increase the yield in midrapidity from the neighbouring rapidity cells , where the yield is large , even if a longitudinal field component , @xmath13 , exists alone .    in refs .",
    "@xcite transverse momentum spectra for gluons were determined in su(3 ) classical field theory .",
    "comparison between this non - abelian and our abelian calculation can be made , if we fix both field strength at the same value .",
    "the energy density of the classical gluon field is given in refs .",
    "@xcite as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . in our calculation",
    ", the initial energy density is related to the field strength @xmath97 : @xmath98 .",
    "assuming the same initial energy density in the abelian and the non - abelian case , we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "now we can rescale our transverse momentum spectra from figures [ bostime ] and [ fertime ] - we choose the results with scaled time - dependent field , @xmath100 ( solid lines ) . in figure [ kras ] our results at rhic energies for fermion ( _ thick solid line _ ) and boson ( _ thin solid line _ ) are displayed together with non - abelian result for classical gluons  @xcite ( _ open diamonds _ ) .",
    "our fermion spectra and the lattice result on classical gluons overlap in the momentum region @xmath101 .",
    "possible parametrization of the two spectra are very close to each other and display the @xmath102 behavior known from ref .",
    "@xcite and from perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "an acceptable slight modification of the time evolution in eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) could lead to a full overlap , even at high-@xmath103 .",
    "this can be demonstrated at @xmath104 with @xmath105 for fermion production ( _ thick dashed line _ ) .",
    "in this paper we investigated fermion and boson production from a strong abelian field in a kinetic model . assuming ultrarelativistic limit and a longitudinally dominant external field",
    ", boson production remains relatively weak in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "however , fermion production is not effected by this setup and a fermion dominance appears in our kinetic model . introducing different parametrizations for the time evolution of the external field ,",
    "we obtain different transverse momentum spectra for fermions and bosons .",
    "only time evolution determines if these spectra are exponential or polynomial .",
    "investigating fermion transverse momentum spectra , our results with abelian external field overlap with the spectra obtained in lattice - qcd calculations for classical gluons at the same energy density .",
