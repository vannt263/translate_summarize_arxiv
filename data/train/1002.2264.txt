    "interactions and mergers of galaxies are common phenomena in the universe",
    ". isolated pairs of galaxies represent a relatively easy way to study interactions between galaxies because these systems , from a kinematical point of view , are simpler than associations and compact groups of galaxies , where so many galaxies participate in the interaction process that it is difficult to discriminate the role of each galaxy in the interaction .    in the case of isolated disk galaxies",
    "the physical processes that determine secular evolution are internal processes ( internal secular evolution ) .",
    "the timescale of these processes is of the order of many galaxy rotation periods and generally involve the interactions of individual stars or gas clouds with collective phenomena such as bars , oval distorsions , spiral structure and triaxial dark matter halos @xcite . in the case of interacting galaxies one talks about environmental secular evolution .",
    "the time scale of the environmental secular evolution is of the same order as that of the internal secular evolution ( both are slow processes ) .",
    "this phenomenon is driven by prolonged gas infall , by minor mergers and by galaxy harassment . secular evolution processes ( internal or external ) are slow phenomena in comparison with galaxy mergers and stripping of gas that also belong to the context of interacting galaxies and",
    "determine their evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy studies @xcite restrict the information only to a few points in a galaxy .",
    "these kinds of studies are principally focused on axisymmetric systems such as isolated galaxies because a full rotation curve is obtained by placing the slit along the major axis of the galaxy . in the case of interacting systems ,",
    "the slit is usually placed only in a few positions obtaining spectra on regions of interest .",
    "although some kinematic information is derived , it is not possible to obtain true rotation curves of the galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "scanning interferometric fabry - perot observations give us kinematic information of the whole interacting system .",
    "this is very important in the case of asymmetrical and perturbed systems as is the case with interacting galaxy pairs .",
    "extended kinematic information can help determine the effect of the interaction process on each of the members of the system @xcite .",
    "this technique allows more sensitivity to detect faint objects due to increased brightness and field of view and has more spatial and spectral resolution than classic spectrographs .",
    "obtaining kinematical information on interacting galaxies systems is useful to understand the effect the interaction could have on each of the members of the pair @xcite .",
    "rotation curves measurement , for instance , is necessary to study the mass distribution in spiral galaxies and for estimation of the amount of dark matter .",
    "there are at least two independent methods to study the mass distribution in paired galaxies using kinematics .",
    "the first one considers the difference in systemic velocities of the galaxy components as a lower limit to the orbital velocity of the smaller galaxy ( companion ) assuming a circular orbit , and the projected separation of the orbital radius of the companion galaxy , in order to estimate the lower limit mass of the larger ( primary ) galaxy @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on the decomposition of the rotation curve , considering the contribution of various mass components such as bulge , disk and dark matter halo .",
    "thus , one can compare the mass derived from the orbital velocity of the companion in a galaxy pair to the more detailed predictions of a mass model , based on the kinematics of each galaxy component .    in this work we study the system ngc 5278/79 ( known also as arp 239 and kpg 390 ) belonging to a particular class of interacting pair of galaxies : the m51-type galaxies . according to @xcite , the two empirical criteria to classify an m51-type pair of galaxies are that the b - band luminosity ratio of the components ( main / satellite ) vary between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and that the projected distance of the satellite does not exceed two optical diameters of the main component . in the case of ngc 5278/79",
    "the b - band luminosity ratio is @xmath3 and the projected separation is @xmath4 kpc ( optical diameter of the main component is @xmath5 kpc as we can see from table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "thus , ngc 5278/79 is classified as an m51-type pair of galaxies .",
    "m51-type galaxy pairs are interesting because the mass of the system can be evaluated , in principle , by two different ways , mentioned above : by means of the rotation curves of each component , and by estimating the orbital motion of the satellite galaxy around the main galaxy . with the help of hst images @xcite , showing dust lanes across the nuclei of both galaxy components",
    "we can determine which are the nearest sides of the galaxies and thus , to determine whether the spiral arms are leading or trailing , as well as to have an extensive view of the geometric conditions of the encounter in order to perform numerical simulations .",
    "it is important to recall that according to several studies , leading spiral arms can only exist in interacting systems with retrograde encounters triggering the formation of @xmath6 spiral arms @xcite , conditions that , in principle , taking into account the morphology , could be fulfilled by ngc 5278/79 .",
    "thus , it is worth to explore this possibility in this particular case .",
    "these are the main motivations of this work .    in this paper we present scanning fabry - perot observations , velocity fields and rotation curves of this interacting galaxy pair .",
    "the aim of this study is to perform detailed kinematic and dynamic analysis of ngc 5278/79 using h@xmath0 kinematical data in order to study the mass distribution of this pair of galaxies with the two methods mentioned above and to determine the type of spiral arms ( leading or trailing ) in the galaxy members with the intention of reproducing both its morphology and kinematics with future numerical simulations that could shed more light on the interaction process .",
    "last , but not least , there are no 3d spectroscopic works on this pair ( neither scanning h@xmath0 fabry - perot nor hi ) neither x - ray data . in section [ datan ]",
    "we present an overview of the observations and the data reduction process . in section [ resl ]",
    "we present the derived velocity field and the associated rotation curve of each component of the pair . in section [ orm ]",
    "the kinematics inferred from the velocity fields and rotation curves is discussed analyzing carefully the role of non - circular motions .",
    "section [ mcrcd ] is devoted to the dynamical analysis with the computation of the mass for each galaxy of the pair .",
    "the discussion is presented in section [ dsc ] , and conclusions are presented in section [ cls ] .",
    "this pair was first cataloged by @xcite with the identifier vv 019 .",
    "it was later included in arp s _ atlas of peculiar galaxies _ with the identifier arp 239 @xcite . grouped with other objects it was classified as _ appearance of fission_. it appears in the karachentsev s catalog of isolated pair of galaxies @xcite as kpg 390 . according to karachentsev s classification , ngc 5278 is the primary galaxy of the pair ( i.e. , the main component ) and ngc 5279 is the secondary one ( i.e. , the satellite , according to the discussion on m51-type of galaxy pairs given above ) . in the _ uppsala general catalog of galaxies _ ngc 5278 and ngc 5279 are identified as ugc 08677 and ugc 08678 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the main data about this pair are collected in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "there are not many works on this pair in the literature .",

    "[ fig1 ] is evident the bridge region , fainter than the continuum emission of the two components of kpg 390 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows hst image from @xcite .",
    "these authors , by means of images observed with the hst wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) at several uv - wavelengths , notice that the inner parts of both components show significant dust lanes and observe that part of the dust seems to spread along one of the arms .",
    "the most remarkable feature is a very curved thin dust lane that drapes across the primary galaxy .",
    "this dust lane starts near the southern spiral arm of ngc 5278 , curves around the small nuclear bulge of this galaxy , and appears in the spiral arm connecting the two galaxies in the north - east direction as one can see in fig .",
    "the presence of dust lanes in this m51-type pair allows to determine the tilt of the galaxy ( nearer or farther side ) once we know the kinematics as it will be discussed later on .",
    "the hst images also show that the encounter clearly distorts the galaxy disks of both components .",

    "we can notice that the difference in the halo mass between pseudo - isothermal and hernquist or nfw halo components is a factor of ten in the mass",

    "indeed , even if leading spiral arms in galaxies are a very uncommon phenomenon , the only examples where are found are interacting systems .",
    "let us revise problem of leading or trailing arms .",
    "@xcite , in a seminal paper , gave a series of criteria in order to determine the true orientation of a galaxy in space and the kind of spiral arms it has .",
    "he also established that in a sample of spiral galaxies the whole trial had trailing arms , concluding that the spiral arms are all trailing , at least for galaxies considered isolated .",
    "however , this last issue has been questioned and some authors have revised this important conclusion of the de vaucouleurs work . the first systematic study on the topic",
    "was done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors from a sample of 200 spiral galaxies found 4 leading arm galaxy candidates . @xcite have shown that one of this four leading arm candidates ( in ngc 5395 ) is not leading .",
    "the other three candidates are highly dubious cases regarding orientation and existence of arms ( ngc 4490 ) and their tilt ( ngc 3786 and ngc 5426 ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that ngc 4622 has leading arms since two pairs of detected arms have the opposite sense with each other .",
    "@xcite detected another example of leading spiral structure in eso 297 - 27 .",
    "thus , as one can see , there are not so many cases of leading spiral arms in the literature .",
    "following @xcite there is a criterion that determines if any particular spiral galaxy has trailing or leading arms .",
    "this criterion is based on three main clues ( receding - approaching side , direction of spiral arms and the tilt of the galaxy , i. e. , which side is closer to observer ) .    in our particular case",
    ", we have both the kinematic information in order to establish which side of the galaxy is receding and which side approaching , as well as very conspicuous morphological aspects such as well defined spiral arm patterns and the presence of dust lanes in both galaxy members running near the galaxy nuclei .",
    "this last issue will be used in what follows in two main ways : 1 ) we will suspect that the nearest side of the galaxy is the side hosting the dust lane and , 2 ) we will check it by getting an intensity profile of the galactic nucleus along the minor axis . in this kind of profiles , the nearest side is the steepest one ( because of the presence of the dust lane ) . in the case of ngc 5278 , the receding radial velocities are in the south - western part , while the approaching radial velocities are at the north - eastern side . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( bottom panel ) it is clear that the arms of ngc 5278 point in anti - clockwise direction and the dust lane is located at the concave side of the bulge , thus the northern side is the nearest .",

    "this galaxy presents an extended spiral arm toward the companion galaxy and between the two galaxies one can see a bridge - like structure probably generated by the interaction process . from the age of interaction",
    "we can say that this is an early - stage interaction .",

    "realistic numerical simulations taking into account the kinematic restrictions are needed to establish the extent to which the interacting process is related to the formation of a possible bar in ngc 5279 .",
    "another interesting feature is the bridge - like structure that is very dim in our observations .",
    "the fact that the bridge region emits weak diffuse line emission enforce the idea that this structure is a consequence of the interaction process and that the transfer of material is effective in this zone .",
    "this area shows double velocity profiles , with velocities in the range of @xmath213 km s@xmath15 .",
    "perhaps the transfer of material between the two galaxies of the pair might generate such double profiles . on the other hand , strong motions due to the nearness of the arm of ngc 5278",
    "might alter the velocity profiles in the bridge area and originate double and broader profiles , due to a second velocity component related to the transfer of gas from one galaxy to the other . as pointed out in section [ velf",
    "] , the radial velocity values of the double peaks in the bridge region are different from the radial velocity values belonging to the disks of both components of kpg 390 .    regarding non - circular motions , the residual velocity map for ngc 5278 reveal large values in the northern region of this galaxy .",
    "the large absolute values of the residual velocities seen in the north - western region and also along the inner part of the south - eastern arm could indicate the response of the gas to the passage of the companion .",
    "this can also be noticed from the pvds extracted along the minor axis . in this sense ,",
    "the non - typical rotation curve of the companion , ngc 5279 , could be a result of interaction .",
    "however , such a difference could also be associated with an intrinsic asymmetry of the disk such as a warp .",
    "we neither can exclude the possibility of an artifact in the determination of the rotation curve , given the small number of points and the large dispersion associated to this curve .",
    "the results of this work is worth to compare with a widely studied interacting grand - design system m51 .",
    "@xcite with n - body simulations were able to match the observed morphological and kinematical data and derive the orbital parameters and the interaction scenario .",
    "they explained the formation of the spiral structure of the main galaxy , tidal tail and bridge as a result of multiple encounters .",
    "in a previous study of a similar m51-type system arp 86 by the same authors , it is shown that the material transfer between the components could explain the large activity of the companion @xcite .",
    "they conclude that such interactions produce an open spiral structure of the primary galaxy , and the bridge tends to be directed to the companion .",
    "the multiple passage scenario discussed in @xcite produces significant peculiar velocities out of the plane of the disk , leading to disturbances in the rotation curve , similar to those observed for ngc 5279 . according to separate studies aimed at the investigation of evolution of such asymmetries in rotation curves ( *",
    "* and references therein ) , the perturbations are short  lived ( @xmath214 gyr ) , suggesting that the encounter for kpg 390 took place within this period .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain a clear picture of the process of interaction in this pair of galaxies only from the kinematical analysis .",
    "we require more information about the stellar component by means of photometry , spectroscopy and population synthesis models .",
    "we also need a detailed dynamical analysis , that would encompass the knowledge of the mass components of both galaxies of kpg 390 and numerical simulations of the pair .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations will allow us to have the time evolution of the interaction process . by comparing the results of numerical simulations with observations we will gain some insight about the present stage of the interaction process .",

    "<S> in this work we present scanning fabry - perot h@xmath0 observations of the isolated interacting galaxy pair ngc 5278/79 obtained with the puma fabry - perot interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we derived velocity fields and rotation curves for both galaxies . for ngc 5278 </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained the residual velocity map to investigate the non - circular motions , and estimated its mass by fitting the rotation curve with a disk+halo components . </S>",
    "<S> we test three different types of halo ( pseudo - isothermal , hernquist and navarro frenk white ) and obtain satisfactory fits to the rotation curve for all profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of dark matter required by pseudo - isothermal profile is about ten times smaller than , that for the other two halo distributions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our kinematical results together with the analysis of dust lanes distribution and of surface brightness profiles along the minor axis allowed us to determine univocally that both components of the interacting pair are trailing spirals . </S>"
