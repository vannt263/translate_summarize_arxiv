    "at the present time , there are many theoretical and experimental works devoted to investigation of the rare decay processes @xmath5 .",
    "these processes are very interesting for studying the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking of strong interaction of hadrons .",
    "recently , the branching ratios for the rare decays of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons to the pair of pions have been measured with good accuracy by snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite collaborations at vepp-2 m @xmath8 collider ( see table [ tab : ropipiga ] where theoretical estimations and experimental results are given ) .",
    "the situation for decays with @xmath9 meson in the final state is worse than for radiative two pion production , there is an estimation for the upper limit for the decay of @xmath7-meson @xmath10 at 90% c.l . only @xcite . therefore , the theoretical predictions for the decays of vector mesons into @xmath11 are of large interest",
    ".    indeed , there are many theoretical works devoted to the description of these processes in different models . for instance , in one of the first works devoted to the calculations of these decays , the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model was used @xcite .",
    "only diagrams with intermediate vector mesons were taken into account and only rough estimations of these processes were obtained . in 1992 , in the framework of a similar model these processes were estimated more accurately and it was found that the vmd leads to too low values of the branching ratios @xcite ( see table 1 ) . lately in @xcite it was found that inclusion of diagrams with scalar meson exchange increases branching ratios , which leads to better agreement with experiment .",
    "there are different methods to take into account the effect of scalar meson exchange .",
    "one of them is connected with phenomenological inclusion of the scalar pole diagram with the mass and the width fixed from experiment @xcite .",
    "this method of inclusion of the scalar meson leads to the breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "other methods taking into account scalar effects are connected with dynamical generation of the scalar meson after unitarization of pseudoscalar meson loop diagrams @xcite or based on linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "let us note that in most these models it was necessary to use additional parameters for description of the above - mentioned rare decays of vector mesons .",
    ".[tab : ropipiga ] branching ratios for the processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 obtained in experiment ( upper part ) and theoretically(lower part ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the photon spectra for widths the of the decays @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rpipig ] , [ fig : opipig ] , [ fig : retpig ] , [ fig : oetpig ] , respectively .",
    "the performed calculations show that the decays widths of the processes @xmath18 are in satisfactory agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "the branching ratio for the process @xmath19 also does not contradict the existing experimental limit . comparing our result with predictions of different theoretical models we can see that decays width with @xmath9-meson is significantly different .",
    "therefore , obtaining the experimental data for these processes is a very topical problem .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in our calculation of rare processes in the framework of the standard njl model no additional parameters are used .",
    "note , that in difference with poor experimental data on decays @xmath20 the situation is much better for decays of @xmath21-meson where rich and accurate experimental information exists . in future",
    "we plan to investigate different decays of @xmath21-meson .",
    "we hope to obtain reasonable results because predictions of the njl model @xcite for the @xmath21-meson mass and the main strong decay into two kaons are in satisfactory agreement with experiment @xcite ."
