    "following the hypothesis given in the abstract we select the following 4 p - wave nonets : @xmath5 .",
    "they are displayed together with the pseudoscalar nonet in figure [ fig1 ] .    as a consequence of the adopted selection criteria we exclude the following candidate states from the pdg listings @xcite : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and resonances with a mass exceeding @xmath9 in particular @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "we pose the following questions :    - is the flavor mixing pattern of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 nonets similar , i.e. near singlet - octet ?",
    "the two nonets would be parity doublets due to chiral symmetry , which is spontaneously and explicitely broken .    - does the scalar gluonic meson distort through large mixing effects the scalar @xmath4 nonet beyond ( spectroscopic ) recognition ?    in our analysis in @xcite we started from the hypothesis , that the answer to this question is no . inspecting the spectra of the p - wave nonets in fig .",
    "1 we observe no strong distortion in the scalar sector indeed .    - can the last question be resolved through direct observation of the scalar gluonic meson as a conventionally narrow resonance and how reliable are the mass estimates from purely gluonic lattice - qcd @xcite    @xmath14    - can qcd sum rules including local gluonic operators @xcite shed light on the above mass estimate ?",
    "the latter two questions are adressed in the accompanying paper @xcite .    * the gell - mann - okubo square mass formula *    according to our analysis @xmath15 ( 980 ) represents the su3 singlet ,",

    "the gell - mann - okubo ( first order ) mass square relation then yields ( in @xmath19 units )    @xmath20    the deviation amounts to @xmath21 is numerically a refinement with respect to ref .",

    "the degeneracy in mass of @xmath22 and @xmath16 , while not offending any basic principles , indicates further dynamic simplicity to be explained .",
    "the aim is to study and eventually confirm the nonstrange versus strange @xmath4 flavor structure of the two singlet - octet assigned isoscalar scalars :    @xmath23    the following phase convention shall be chosen in the flavor basis    @xmath24    and in the ns - s basis we have    @xmath25    so in the flavor basis we have    @xmath26    as conjectured range of the singlet - octet angle @xmath27 we consider    @xmath28    the corresponding range for @xmath29 becomes    @xmath30    previously @xcite we have analysed the decays involving @xmath0 : @xmath31 , the radiative decays @xmath32 and @xmath33 and concluded on a large flavor mixing similar to @xmath34-@xmath35 in the pseudoscalar nonet .",
