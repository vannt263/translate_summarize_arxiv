    "once a solar - type star has been suggested to harbour a planetary - mass companion , it is interesting to investigate any similarities with the sun , as well as to find possible differences with respect to other single stars .",

    "if the difference in lithium abundances between the two stars ( which have kept a similar be abundance ) is caused by a slow mixing mechanism , which transports the material from the base of the outer convection zone to the li burning layer , associated with the angular momentum loss ( as suggested by king et al .",
    "1997a ) , the stars must have had a different angular momentum history ( i.e. different initial angular momenta or different loss rates ) .",

    "a possible explanation could lie in the large eccentric orbits of the planetary companions to these stars , with proto - planetary disks which could have then had a smaller effect on the pre - ms stellar rotation rates .",
    "although the companion to 16 cyg b also presents a very - high orbital eccentricity , it is possible that it has been altered from a more circular one by gravitational perturbation due to 16 cyg a ( mazeh et al .",
    "in addition , a check has to be made on whether or not the mixing mechanisms proposed predict correctly the observed abundances . from figure 11 of stephens",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , it seems that the rotationally - induced model of deliyannis & pinsonneault ( 1993 ) predicts significant li differences and similar ( solar ) beryllium abundances for stars with @xmath92 k , an age of 4 gyr , and a difference of 20 km s@xmath22 in their initial equatorial velocity .",

    "orbital migration of planets formed at large radii and transported inwards by tidal interactions with the proto - planetary disk could occur ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , and would result in adding metal - rich material to the parent star .",
    "the degree of chemical enrichment would depend on the fraction of the star over which the accreted material is distributed , which is linked to the age and evolutionary stage of the parent star .",
    "laughlin & adams ( 1997 ) predict that solar - type stars with maximum disk lifetimes of @xmath94 myr should have virtually no metallicity enhancement , while more massive stars ( early f- to late a - type , with shallower convection zones ) could experience more significant chemical enrichments .",
    "gonzalez ( 1998 ) discusses the possibility that 16 cyg a could have had in the past a planetary companion like that of 16 cyg b , but which was engulfed by its parent star after the time needed to disturb the companion of 16 cyg b from its original circular orbit .",
    "this could have increased its observed lithium abundance ( which survives in the outer fraction of the stellar interior where the temperature is lower than @xmath7 k ) without changing significantly ( @xmath31 dex ) the overall stellar metallicity , but what would be its effect on the beryllium abundance",
    "? it will be interesting to perform detailed computations simulating the accretion of planets of different sizes onto parent stars with different masses at different evolutionary stages , to obtain better estimates of the possible enrichment of light elements .",
    "however , if this were the explanation of the abundances observed for 16 cyg a & b , what would be the peculiarities of this system which cause it to differ from parent stars with similar effective temperatures , such as 51 peg , 47 uma , hd 114762 , the sun , or even the cooler 70 vir and hotter @xmath51 and , which do not show such dramatic lithium depletion ?",

    "the effective temperature adopted by garca lpez et al . for the umag star hd 41593 is the same as that adopted here for @xmath9 cnc .",
    "the analysis of hd 41593 shows that a similar low beryllium abundance is compatible with the observed spectrum , but its low s /",
    "n ( @xmath100 ) makes it also compatible with a larger abundance .",
    "the stellar parameters derived by gonzalez ( 1998 ) for @xmath9 cnc place the star in the subgiant region of the hr diagram , confirming previous claims in this direction .",
    "however , the age derived for the star using theoretical isochrones turns to be @xmath101 gyr , i.e. much greater than the accepted age of the universe .",
    "if @xmath9 cnc were indeed a subgiant star , the observed li and be depletions could be due to a dilution effect taking place once the star has evolved off the ms and the convection zone deepens and mixes li- and be - rich material with li- and be - free material from the inner region .",
    "strong li and be depletions have been found by boesgaard & chesley ( 1976 ) among several late g- and early k - type subgiants , which appear to agree with theoretical predictions for dilution .",
    "a possible alternative explanation suggested by gonzalez ( 1998 ) is that @xmath102 cnc is an unresolved stellar binary viewed nearly pole - on , and this could be tested by searching for variations in the line profile shapes .",
    "the very - low lithium abundance of @xmath9 cnc is compatible with strong depletion experienced by an old late g - type ms star ( @xmath103 gyr , baliunas et al .",

    "11 of stephens et al .",
    "extrapolating the corresponding be isochrones in the figure may not give an adequate prediction of the be abundance for @xmath9 cnc , because strong be depletion may occur for effective temperatures much cooler than those considered in the plot . indeed , older rotating models computed by pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1990 ; case a ) , which include angular momentum loss , predict beryllium depletions of 0.23 to 0.45 dex for 0.80.9 @xmath104 stars ( @xmath105 k ) at 1.7 gyr ( the greatest age considered ) , with initial angular momenta in the range @xmath106",
    "gr @xmath107 s@xmath22 .",
    "other angular momentum loss and internal redistribution properties ( cases labeled as b to f ) predict similar be depletions at that age .",
    "the strong be depletion observed in @xmath9 cnc would therefore set a very significant constraint on the theoretical models .",
    "other old and cool stars which are not suspected to have a companion planet should be observed to distinguish any possible planetary influence on the be abundance of @xmath9 cnc .",
    "beryllium abundances have been derived for the solar - like stars 16 cyg a & b and the cooler object @xmath9 cnc , for which there are published values of their lithium abundances .",
    "16 cyg b and @xmath9 cnc are candidates to be parents of extrasolar planets , and by measuring their be abundances we aim at studying the potential dependence on the presence of planetary companions of detailed processes operating in their structure and evolution .",
    "16 cyg a & b show very similar be abundances , which are compatible with the solar value , while the lithium abundance of 16 cyg b is at least a factor 6 smaller than that of 16 cyg a. different rates of mixing of material in their interiors associated with different angular momentum histories , as well as the hypothetical ingestion of a planetary companion by 16 cyg a are discussed as potential explanations .",
    "the existence of two other solar - like parent stars , whose li ( and be ) does not show strong depletion , i.e. whose behaviour is like 16 cyg a , the sun and the majority of similar stars with li and be abundances available , implies that the 16 cyg system requires special observational and theoretical attention .",
    "a low upper limit has been derived for the beryllium abundance of @xmath9 cnc .",
    "this is the first time a precise limit has been set and that such strong be depletion has been observed in a late g-/early k - type ms star .",
    "this measurement clearly constrains the depletion predictions of the available mixing mechanisms , but requires observation of planet - free stars with similar age and spectral type to discard the potential effects of the planetary companion on the li and be depletions .",
    "claims have also been made indicating that @xmath9 cnc appears to be a subgiant . if this were the case , its strong li and be depletions could be explained by a dilution process taking place during its post - ms evolution .",
