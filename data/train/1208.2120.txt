    "for @xmath163 one can check directly that @xmath155 is a strictly increasing function for @xmath231 .",
    "indeed ( [ pxi_lim2 ] ) is valid for @xmath163 and gives @xmath232 where @xmath233 are the two solutions of @xmath234 .",
    "note that both terms in ( [ pxi_dim2 ] ) are positive .",
    "differentiation of the first term yields @xmath235 because @xmath236 .",
    "analogously the derivative of the second term gives a positive contribution because @xmath237 .    for @xmath183",
    "our calculations above imply that @xmath155 is a decreasing function in a neighbourhood of @xmath161 .",
    "for @xmath165 we have also shown that @xmath155 is a decreasing function near @xmath162 ( for @xmath164 our results are consistent with a decreasing function ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath155 may be a decreasing function over its full support @xmath238 for @xmath239 .",
    "such a conjecture is supported by all example calculations that we have performed  however we have not been able to prove it .",
    "let us now illustrate our results with a few examples that allow for more explicit treatment .      for a harmonic oscillator",
    "the hamilton function is linear in the action variables @xmath240 the unit energy shell @xmath97 in action space is then described by the function @xmath241 the volume of the region @xmath96 is @xmath242 .",
    "+ from @xmath243 one finds its maximum value at @xmath244 such that @xmath245 .",
    "this implies the critical value @xmath246 for the normalised nodal count .",
    "note that the individual frequencies do not enter . indeed the complete nodal count distribution with @xmath2 degrees of freedom",
    "does not depend on the frequencies and can be expressed as @xmath247 for @xmath163 this integral has the explicit form @xmath248 for arbitrary @xmath2 one may evaluate all positive integer moments @xmath249 see figure [ numerical_limit_dist ] for the graph of the limiting distribution ( [ ho_pxi ] ) for @xmath250 together with numerical data obtained for finite energy intervals .",
    "( first row ) , @xmath164 ( second row ) , and @xmath251 ( third row ) .",
    "the black lines correspond to the limiting distributions @xmath252 .",
    "the red , green , and blue lines are numerically obtained histograms of the nodal count distribution at finite energy intervals : red line @xmath253 $ ] , green line @xmath254 $ ] , blue line @xmath255 $ ] .",
    "the chosen values for @xmath256 are given in the corresponding graphs together with the chosen system parameters ( the hamiltonian ) , and the bin size @xmath257 that has been used for the histograms . in each case normalised nodal counts have been obtained for the lowest 50 to 80 million eigenfunctions .",
    "+ the insets magnify the graph near the critical cut - off value @xmath258 .",
    "overall the numerically obtained histograms are consistent with the ( weak ) convergence to the limiting distribution . , scaledwidth=85.0% ]      we consider the free particle in an @xmath2-dimensional cuboid ( rectangular box ) with side lengths @xmath221 ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "with dirichlet conditions on the boundary of the box one obtains exact energy eigenvalues @xmath260 where the quantum numbers @xmath73 run over positive integers .",
    "the corresponding classical hamilton function @xmath261 is homogeneous of order @xmath63 .",
    "the unit energy shell @xmath97 is given in terms of the function @xmath262 the volume of the region @xmath96 is @xmath263 .",
    "+ the maximal volume @xmath140 of a cube touching the unit energy shell is given by @xmath264 ( where @xmath265 ) .",
    "one thus finds the critical value @xmath266 above which the limiting nodal domain distribution vanishes .",
    "similarly to the harmonic oscillator the critical value and the limiting distribution do not depend on the detailed system parameters such as the side lengths .",
    "indeed the limiting distribution may be written as @xmath267 for @xmath163 this reduces to @xmath268 see figure [ numerical_limit_dist ] for graphs of the distribution for @xmath269 together with numerically obtained histograms for finite energy intervals .",
    "we have derived an expression for the limiting nodal count distribution in the case where the wave equation is separable , and we have extracted some universal features of this distribution . while we have formally limited the scope with the assumptions ( a1 ) to ( a5 ) many standard examples as",
    "the harmonic oscillator or the particle in a cubic box obey all of these conditions .",
    "for some other examples which do not obey all of the conditions it is straight forward to generalize our derivations .",
    "for instance a particle in a spherical box does not obey assumption ( a4 ) as action variables that correspond to angular momenta are not bounded from below . in this case",
    "the wave function separates in variables , some of which are cyclic .",
    "the derivation of a limiting distribution follows in full analogy once the expression for the nodal count in terms of quantum numbers is adapted and the poisson summation is performed over the corresponding set of quantised action variables .",
    "indeed most of our assumptions are purely technical and can be relaxed if necessary  though relaxing condition ( a3 ) may imply that there are additional local maxima of the volume @xmath140 which may lead to further singularities within the support of the limiting nodal domain distribution .",
    "also assumption ( a5 ) that the hamiltonian is a homogeneous function can be relaxed to a certain degree .",
    "indeed it is only needed that the energy shell at high energies can be described asymptotically by a homogeneous function .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to compare our results to nodal count distributions of non - separable or wave - chaotic systems in dimensions larger than two . in any dimension one may try to obtain nodal counts numerically by using a corresponding adaptation of the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite and apply it to numerically obtained eigenfunctions .",
    "berry s conjecture @xcite states that highly excited chaotic eigenfunctions can be simulated by a gaussian random wave ensemble . in this ensemble",
    "the wave function is given by @xmath270 where @xmath271 are uniformly distributed on a unit @xmath211-sphere and the phases @xmath272 are equidistributed on @xmath273 . on dimensional grounds",
    "one expects that the number of nodal domain in a given region of the random wave is proportional to the volume of the region . for two - dimensional random waves",
    "this has been checked and it is consistent with the critical percolation conjecture @xcite .",
    "we tried to check this in three dimensions by finding the number of nodal domains of random waves inside a cube of side length @xmath274 ( at fixed wave number @xmath275 ) .",
    "the artificial boundary of the cube leads to nodal domains which intersect the boundary  indeed we have found that all nodal domains in our numerical approach were intersecting the boundary and that the nodal count is proportional to @xmath276 rather than @xmath277 .",
    "this scaling is expected on dimensional grounds for the number of nodal domains which intersect the boundary .",
    "however we were not able to increase the side length beyond @xmath278 ( about 16 wave lengths ) on a standard desktop and we have just looked at a few hundred realisations .",
    "we can not exclude that interior nodal domains ( those which do not touch the artificial boundary ) start to appear in much larger cubes and eventually dominate the nodal count .",
    "we can say however that any crossover from @xmath276 ( boundary dominated ) to @xmath277 ( bulk dominated ) would have to occur at considerably higher side lengths for which applying our numerical algorithm is beyond the power of standard desktop computers .",
    "+ our numerical findings do confirm the basic expectation that the universality of a critical percolation model does not apply in the three dimensional case .",
    "for instance we find that the volume of the largest nodal domain scales linearly with the volume of the cube  a clear indication that one is inside the ( non - universal ) percolating regime ( a non - trivial exponent is expected at the percolation transition ) .",
    "we hope that future research will shed more light on the nodal sets and nodal counts of wave - chaotic systems in dimensions @xmath183 as well as in the corresponding random - wave models .",
