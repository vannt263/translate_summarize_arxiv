    "studies of nuclei far off stability have given a new impact to nuclear structure physics .",

    "hence , structure investigations far off stability are providing important extensions into hitherto unexplored regions of the nuclear landscape .",
    "it is apparent that such studies involve far reaching extrapolations of nuclear models much beyond the range where they were initially developed .",
    "the weaker binding of strongly asymmetric systems enhances interactions between bound and unbound configurations and the regime of open quantum systems might be approached . in extreme dripline nuclei as e.g. @xmath2b @xcite and @xmath3li @xcite evidence for a strong competition of interactions between individual nucleons and mean  field dynamics is found .    at present nuclear structure theory",
    "is making first exploratory steps into the new regions far off @xmath4-stability .",
    "experience shows that seemingly well established models describing stable nuclei equally well are leading to strong deviations when applied to exotic systems .",
    "a particular striking feature are the variations in predictions of binding energies and other ground state properties at large charge asymmetry .",
    "the results indicate that the isovector properties of interactions are not well enough understood in order to reproduce or predict the location of driplines .",
    "a widely applied method in non  relativistic structure calculations is the skyrme approach @xcite .",
    "although very successful in stable nuclei , it is an open question to what extent the restricted set of operators used in the skyrme energy functional is sufficiently accounting for the conditions in the new mass regions .",
    "the transparent structure and the good applicability is a clear advantage of the skyrme model .",
    "it is also flexible enough for adjusting the already incorporated parameters or introducing additional ones in order to describe new data .",
    "however , a purely empirical approach might be hampered by increasing uncertainties when approaching the limits of stability .",
    "the intention of the present work is to indicate an alternative approach which is closer to a more microscopic description but still retains to a large extent the advantages of using a local energy functional as in skyrme theory .",
    "a more fundamental description requires to use microscopically derived in ",
    "medium interactions as e.g. the brueckner g  matrix accounting for medium effects on the level of ladder diagrams @xcite .",
    "theoretically , such a full scale many - body calculation is not feasible as a standard approach to finite nuclei , except for selected cases @xcite .",
    "a successful program is to use instead a g  matrix from infinite nuclear matter and to apply it in the local density approximation ( lda ) to finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the lda has been used succesfully in non ",
    "relativistic @xcite and also covariant fieldtheoretical models @xcite .",
    "however , the finite range character of a realistic g  matrix is well known to introduce complications on the numerical level by leading to a system of integro  differential equations @xcite .",
    "a way around this problem was discussed some time ago by negele @xcite but rarely applied later .",
    "the numerical complications arise because of the non  locality of exchange contributions to the hf  field . for a finite range interaction",
    "they involve the full one  body density matrix rather than the local densities needed for the direct parts and contact interactions of skyrme type .",
    "negele introduced an operator - valued expansion of the non  local parts of the density matrix . the contraction with the hf ",
    "ground state configuration leads to a systematic expansion in terms of the local one - body density .",
    "the non  localities are contained in functions where the lowest order contribution coincides with the well known slater approximation @xcite .",
    "this density matrix expansion ( dme ) allows to integrate out the non  localities of the exchange terms .",
    "the approach presented below follows in spirit closely the original work of ref .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "[ 2 ] the basic steps of the dme are summarized .",
    "different to negele we choose an effective local  fermi  momentum q@xmath5(*r * ) such that the next to leading order term of the dme series is canceled exactly .",
    "q@xmath5 is determined by the kinetic energy density and , in addition , the laplacian of the one  body density . for an infinite system the conventional expression for the fermi momentum",
    "is recovered .",
    "the dme results are then used to define a local energy density functional . since it originates from an effective interaction , assumed to be given independently e.g. by brueckner calculation ,",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed . by variation of the energy functional hf ",
    "equations are derived . with our choice for q@xmath6",
    "the kinetic energy part of the single particle schroedinger equation receives additional contributions .",
    "thus , we obtain consistently effective masses m@xmath7(r ) for protons and neutrons , respectively , which are completely determined by the momentum and isospin structure of the original interaction . an important extension over the skyrme approach",
    "is that the self  consistent local momentum q@xmath6 contributes in arbitrarily high order to the exchange terms which is especially important at high and low densities .",
    "applications to infinite symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter are discussed in section [ 3 ] .",
    "we start by choosing a somewhat simplified effective interaction .",
    "the three yukawa parameterization of a g  matrix calculated initially for @xmath8o by toki et al.@xcite is used .",
    "called m3y interaction has been widely and successfully applied in nuclear reaction @xcite and structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the former studies , especially for nuclear reactions , indicate that this interaction has a realistic momentum structure including a long range one pion  exchange tail .",
    "it is especially trustable at low nuclear densities around @xmath9 of the saturation density .",
    "a density dependence is lacking and it is known that the original m3y parameterization does not lead to saturation of nuclear matter . as other authors before @xcite , we restore the density dependence by fitting the properties of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation including the binding energy , equilibrium density , compressibility and , in addition , also the symmetry energy .",
    "this allows to fix the density dependence of the isoscalar and isovector vertices in the spin ",
    "scalar particle  hole interaction channels .",
    "we thus have determined a renormalized density dependent three yukawa ( d3y ) interaction which we expect to resemble closely the momentum structure of a g  matrix but with an effective strength fitted to nuclear matter properties @xcite .",

    "4 ] the model is applied to finite nuclei .",
    "the parameters are kept fixed as obtained from the nuclear matter fits .",
    "binding energies , charge densities and radii of stable nuclei ( @xmath8o,@xmath10ca,@xmath11zr and @xmath12pb ) are well described .",
    "the good agreement confirms the approach and makes applications to unstable nuclei meaningful .",
    "hf calculations for sn isotopes lead to a good description of the binding energies for a@xmath13120 but a slightly too weak binding is found in the lighter nuclides .",
    "the calculations predict rather thick neutron skins for a@xmath14130 .",
    "the paper closes in section [ 5 ] with a summary and conclusions .",

    "the exact treatment of the exchange term in the hartree - fock functional would , after variation , lead to a coupled system of integro - differential equations .",

    "more recently khoa and von oertzen @xcite , have noted that the `` bare '' m3y interaction leads at high densities to the collapse of nuclear matter but by supplementing a phenomenological density dependence the correct binding properties could be restored . in spirit",

    "all higher order terms are canceled and the exact energy density is recovered . in finite nuclei",

    "the functional form of the vertex functions was chosen in close analogy to the dynamical structure and the medium dependence of the vertices in a brueckner g  matrix .",
    "the parameters , however , were determined empirically by a fit to the binding energy , equilibrium density , compressibility and the symmetry energy of symmetric nuclear matter . the momentum structure of the original g  matrix was retained .",
    "the probably first attempt to parameterize a g  matrix in terms of fixed propagators and density dependent vertices goes back to sprung and banerjee @xcite .",
    "they approximated the momentum structure of the singlet / triplet even - odd interactions obtained from the reid nn potential by a superposition of 5 arbitrarily chosen gaussians with channel dependent in  medium vertices .",

    "was deduced @xcite .",
    "however , nuclear matter was found to be badly underbound by about 5  mev since only two - body correlations were taken into account .",

    "microscopic approach include effectively also contributions beyond the two  body cluster approximation , as was pointed out some time ago by bethe @xcite .",
    "in nuclear matter the d3y interaction leads to an equation of state with an unusual enhancement of attraction at low densities which is not found for phenomenological forces .",
    "unfortunately , g  matrix calculations are not available at such low densities but obviously the free nn t ",
    "matrix should be approached asymptotically .",
    "phenomenological interactions and also the unrenormalized m3y g  matrix do not account for this transition . without putting too much emphasis on the details of this particular result it might be expected that such a region of enhanced attraction could indeed exist in the far tails of nuclear wave functions . before drawing final conclusions on this subject a refined treatment of the low density region",
    "is clearly necessary . for that purpose an extended version of the schematic model for the in ",
    "medium vertices might prove to be useful .",
    "the ground state properties of stable nuclei were reproduced reasonably well .",

    "we will only consider the central part of the interaction .",
