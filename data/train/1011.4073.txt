    "before the recent discovery of the six short period binary wd systems containing @xmath1 elm wds @xcite , there were only six double wd systems known to have short enough orbital periods to merge within a hubble time ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . even though the supernovae ia progenitor survey ( spy ) identified @xmath2100 new double degenerate systems from a sample of 1000 wds observed using the very large telescope , @xcite identify only eight merger candidates ( including both wd+wd and sdb+wd systems ) from the spy and the literature .",
    "this fraction ( 8 out of 1000 ) is relatively small compared to the fraction of merger systems ( 6 out of 8) among the elm wds in the literature @xcite .",
    "low - mass ( @xmath3 ) he - core wds are formed when a companion strips the outer envelope from a post main - sequence star before the star reaches the tip of the red giant branch and ignites helium .",
    "they are usually found in close binaries , mostly double degenerate systems @xcite .",
    "however , about half of the low - mass wds in the field do not show any radial velocity variations , indicating that they are single @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that these single low - mass wds may come from old metal - rich stars that truncate their evolution prior to the helium flash from severe mass loss .",
    "they estimate a binary fraction of 50% for @xmath4  m@xmath5 wds .",
    "however , they predict that the binary fraction rises to 100% for @xmath0 elm wds , since such extreme mass loss rates are not expected even for the most metal - rich stars in the galaxy .      to study the binary fraction of elm wds and to find future merger systems , we have undertaken an mmt survey of all previously identified elm wds from the sdss dr4 area @xcite and the hypervelocity star survey of @xcite .",
    "the latter sample is described in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "part of the sdss dr4 sample was discussed earlier in @xcite . here",
    ", we present radial velocity observations of 7 more elm wd candidates from the sdss sample .",
    "the combined sample contains 23 wds .",
    "we also report on _ chandra _ x - ray observations of three elm wds to search for x - ray evidence of milli - second pulsar ( msp ) companions .",
    "while almost all sdss elm wds show radial velocity variations , none show evidence of main - sequence or neutron star companions in the optical , radio @xcite , or x - ray ( this paper and * ? ? ?",
    "hence , they are almost certainly binary wd systems . out of the 20 short period binary systems in our sample",
    ", 12 have merger times shorter than a hubble time .",
    "our elm survey has now tripled the number of known merging wd systems . based on our sample and",
    "previously known short period binary wd systems , we study the mass - period distribution and future evolutionary prospects , including the connections to unusual stellar populations and underluminous supernovae ( sne ) .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss our radial velocity and x - ray observations . in section 3",
    "we present an analysis of the optical spectroscopy and x - ray data and the nature of the companions . in section 4",
    "we discuss the sample characteristics of elm wds , including the binary fraction , mass - period distribution , merging systems , and the implications for underluminous sne and other unusual merger products .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "@xcite identified 13 low - mass wd candidates with @xmath6 . @xcite",
    "discuss follow - up observations of four of these targets .",
    "we selected 6 more targets for follow - up mmt spectroscopy .",
    "these targets are sdss j002228.45 + 003115.5 , j002207.65@xmath7101423.5 , j123410.36@xmath7022802.8 , j162542.10 + 363219.1 , j204949.78 + 000547.3 , and j225242.25@xmath7005626.6 .",
    "we also observed sdss j234536.48@xmath7010204.8 , another elm wd candidate identified by @xcite .",
    "there are three more targets in the @xcite elm wd sample that lack follow - up spectroscopy . these targets ( sdss j1056 + 6536 , j1426 + 0100 , and j1630 + 4233 ) have @xmath8 based on the model fits by @xcite and @xmath9 based on the fits by @xcite .",
    "radial velocity observations of these objects will be useful for the identification of more short period binary wd systems .",
    "we used the 6.5 m mmt equipped with the blue channel spectrograph to obtain moderate resolution spectroscopy of seven elm wd candidates over 17 different nights between 2008 september and 2010 july .",
    "we operate the spectrograph with the 832 line mm@xmath10 grating in second order , providing wavelength coverage 3600   to 4500   and a spectral resolution of 1.0 - 1.2  , depending on the slit size used .",
    "we obtain all observations at the parallactic angle , with a comparison lamp exposure paired with every observation .",
    "we flux - calibrate using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite , and we measure radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "our radial velocity measurement procedures are described in @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from radio msps is expected to be less highly beamed than radio emission , as a major component of the x - ray emission comes from the hot neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "blackbody emission from the surface of a possible pulsar companion to the elm wds will be gravitationally bent , allowing observation of @xmath1175% of the neutron star surface in x - rays even if the radio pulsar beam ( produced well above the surface ) misses our line of sight @xcite .",
    "all 15 radio msps with precise positions in unconfused regions of the globular cluster 47 tuc have been clearly detected in x - rays @xcite , with no observed correlation between their radio and x - ray luminosities ( expected , as they are produced via different mechanisms ) .",
    "there is also no evidence for differences in the x - ray properties of globular cluster vs. galactic msps @xcite .",
    "this result allows us to use the 47 tuc msp sample ( with accurate @xmath12 values due to its well - known distance ) to predict that other msps should have x - ray luminosities above @xmath12(0.5 - 6 kev)@xmath13 erg / s , the minimum @xmath12 of msps in 47 tuc .",
    "thus , deep x - ray upper limits can rule out the presence of an msp , as in the elm wd sdss j0917 + 4638 @xcite .",
    "the msps in 47 tuc show x - ray spectra dominated by thermal blackbody - like emission from the neutron star polar cap surfaces , with temperature @xmath14 k @xcite .",
    "some msps also show additional ( sometimes much higher @xmath12 ) components due to magnetospheric emission or pulsar wind shocks , but there is no evidence for a msp lacking the thermal component .",
    "we obtained _ chandra _ observations of three elm wds ( sdss j105353.89 + 520031.0 , j123410.36@xmath7022802.8 , and j092345.59 + 302805.0 ) to search for msp x - ray emission .",
    "none of these wds had been previously observed in the x - rays since the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xcite , where the short exposure time was insufficient to place useful limits .",
    "we observed the three systems with _",
    "chandra _ s acis - s instrument in very faint mode , for the exposure times noted in table 1 .",
    "we used ciao 4.2 ( with caldb 4.2.1 ) to reprocess the observations with current calibrations and reduce the backgrounds using very faint mode cleaning .",
    "we constructed images in the 0.3 - 6 kev band , and found no x - ray photons within the 1  error circles around each source .",
    "we use poisson statistics @xcite to place 99% confidence upper limits on the count rate .",
    "we compute distances to the elm wds using the models of @xcite and the sdss @xmath15 magnitudes , and @xmath16 values using the colden tool @xcite .",
    "we use pimms and the x - ray spectrum of the faintest msp in 47 tuc ( 47 tuc - t , 134 ev blackbody ) to produce 0.5 - 6 kev @xmath12 upper limits , which we list in table 1 .    the 99% confidence @xmath12 upper limits are all at least a factor of 10 fainter than the faintest msp identified in 47 tuc , and 21 times fainter than the median @xmath12 of these msps @xcite .",
    "thus the lack of x - ray emission from these wds is strong evidence that the unseen companions are not msps .",
    "four of our seven targets exhibit significant radial velocity variations , with peak - to - peak velocity amplitudes between 124 and 232 km s@xmath10 .",

    "population synthesis models and a large , unbiased , magnitude - limited survey of low - mass and elm wds like that of @xcite will be useful to constrain the elm wd cooling models .",
    "another important prediction of the population synthesis models is that there should not be many systems with periods less than an hour .",
    "we have three elm wd systems with periods close to 1 hr . the shortest period system , j1053 + 5200 has a period of 61 min @xcite .",
    "the shortest period hydrogen - rich cataclysmic variable ( cv ) v485 cen has an orbital period of 59 min @xcite .",
    "both short period binary wds and cvs are expected to contribute to the am cvn population , which contains interacting wd binary systems with orbital periods ranging from a few minutes to about an hour .",
    "the two longest period am cvn systems have periods of 56 min and 66 min , respectively @xcite .",
    "it seems that hydrogen - deficient am cvn interacting binary systems have periods less than about an hour and the hydrogen - rich detached wd systems have orbital periods about an hour or longer .      before the sdss",
    ", elm wds were traditionally found as companions to msps .",
    "the masses for the msp companions are usually measured from the pulsar timing measurements since the wds are usually too faint for follow - up optical spectroscopy . @xcite and @xcite obtained keck and vlt spectroscopy of companions to two msp systems . @xcite",
    "derive @xmath46 8550 @xmath67 25 k and @xmath68 g = 6.75 @xmath67 0.07 for the companion to psr j1012 + 5307 , whereas @xcite obtain @xmath46 10,090 @xmath67 150 k and @xmath68 g = 6.44 @xmath67 0.20 for the companion to psr j1911 - 5958a .",
    "these two wds are included in figure 8 .",
    "@xcite discovered the lowest surface gravity wd known at the time , sdss j0917 + 4638 , with @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite discovered two wds with even lower surface gravities , sdss j1233 + 1602 and j2119@xmath70018 .",
    "these wds are included in our elm wd sample and in figure 8 . based on the @xcite and @xcite models , all of these wds , including the two msp companions , have @xmath70 .",
    "there are about a dozen wds in figure 8 with @xmath71 , but none below that mass limit",
    ". however , this result is most likely due to observational biases present in the sdss and the hypervelocity star survey .",
    "the former is , of course , an incomplete spectroscopic survey and the latter has a color selection that excludes @xmath72 10000 k objects with @xmath73 ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "based on the @xcite models , a 0.16 @xmath23 wd takes 15 gyr to cool down from 9200 k to about 7000 k with an increase in surface gravity from @xmath74 5.7 to 6.4 and a decrease in luminosity from @xmath75 8.1 to 11.1 mag .",
    "such wds are not included in the hypervelocity star survey color selection .    based on radio timing measurements ,",
    "45 out of 99 msps with periods less than 20 ms have companions less massive than @xmath76 ( b. kiziltan 2010 , private communication ) .",
    "the spectral types of the companions are unknown",
    ". however , a large fraction of these objects are expected to be low - mass wds ; nature produces @xmath77 wds in msp systems .",
    "lower mass elm wds should be produced in binary wd systems as well .",
    "population synthesis calculations for double wds do not predict many wds below 0.17 @xmath23 , but such wds may eventually be found in double wd systems in the sdss or other spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the end result of the future evolution of the 12 elm wd merger systems in our sample depends on the mass ratios of the two components .",
    "the systems with extreme mass ratios ( @xmath78 ) should have stable mass transfer at initial roche lobe filling .",
    "stable mass transfer leads to the formation of am cvn systems that transfer angular momentum back to the orbit , which increases the orbital period .",
    "if the higher mass wds in such systems have masses close to the chandrasekhar limit , accretion may result in a type ia sne explosion .",
    "however , the probability of such an event is small ( @xmath79 7% ) for our systems",
    ". this probability would be higher if sub - chandrasekhar mass wd explosions also contribute to the observed type ia sne population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , our elm survey is biased against sne ia progenitors due to the selection of very low - mass primaries .",
    "figure 13 shows the mass ratios and periods for our elm wd sample plus the previously known binary wd systems .",
    "single - lined systems are shown as filled triangles , whereas the double - lined systems and the eclipsing wd system nltt 11748 are shown as filled circles .",
    "open circles mark the objects with merger times shorter than a hubble time . out of the 18 merger systems , six have mass ratios smaller than 0.25 ( assuming an average inclination of 60@xmath39 ) , and are likely to form am cvn systems .",
    "these six systems also have the highest total mass ( @xmath80 ) in our sample .",
    "j1233 + 1602 is the most extreme case with @xmath81 for @xmath30 .",
    "it is striking that the number of extreme mass ratio systems in our sample ( six ) is the same as the number of am cvn systems found in the sdss data relase 5 area @xcite .",
    "these systems are potential sne .ia",
    "progenitors @xcite .    based on a magnitude - limited sample of six elm wd mergers",
    ", @xcite find that half of their sample has mass ratios of @xmath20.15 and they estimate a contribution factor of @xmath823% to the am cvn formation rate from the observed population of elm wds .",
    "the fraction of extreme mass ratio systems in our survey is also 50% ( six out of 12 elm wds ) , supporting the conclusions reached by @xcite .",
    "the other six elm wd systems in our sample have mass ratios larger than 0.4 .",
    "@xcite discuss various evolutionary scenarios for these objects .",
    "these systems will merge within a hubble time and form a variety of exotic objects including underluminous sne , extreme helium stars ( rcrb ) , or single helium - enriched subdwarf o stars .",
    "the merger rate of elm wds is roughly the same as the observed rate of underluminous sne @xcite .",
    "sdss j1234@xmath70228 is a unique elm wd merger system .",
    "there is a 85% chance that the combined mass of the two stars in this system is lower than 0.45 @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , within the next few billion years , this system will merge and likely form a a single low - mass wd .",
    "there are several scenarios to explain the presence of single low - mass ( @xmath83 ) wds , including enhanced mass - loss from metal - rich progenitors @xcite and mass loss through common envelope evolution with a low - mass brown dwarf or planetary mass companion @xcite .",
    "single low - mass wds can also form through mergers of two lower - mass wds @xcite , though no such progenitors have been found until now . here",
    "we have uncovered a potential progenitor system for a future single low - mass wd , j1234@xmath70228 .    about 10% of da wds are low - mass @xcite and half of these low - mass wds are single @xcite , corresponding to a space density of 2.5 @xmath84 kpc@xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the sdss dr4 wd catalog covers 4783 square degrees with @xmath86 mag @xcite .",
    "we estimate the local space density using the modified @xmath87 method and the disk model of @xcite .",
    "based on one system , j1234@xmath70228 , the space density of merging wd systems that can form single low - mass wds is 1.1 kpc@xmath85 .",
    "this number is likely uncertain by a factor of 10 due to incompleteness of the sdss spectroscopic target selection .",
    "nevertheless , it is several orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated space density of single low - mass wds .",
    "hence , this formation channel does not significantly contribute to the single low - mass wd population in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our mmt elm survey has now discovered 20 short period binary wd systems , including 12 merger systems . only six binary wd merger systems were known prior to our work .",
    "the elm survey has now tripled the number of such systems .",
    "these merger systems provide potential formation channels for a variety of interesting objects including underluminous sne , am cvn , extreme helium stars , single subdwarf stars , and now single low - mass wds .",
    "all but one of the 19 stars with @xmath58 are in binaries , strongly arguing for a binary formation channel for elm wds . the combined sample of more than 40 short period wd systems found in our elm survey and the literature",
    "demonstrate that the shortest period detached wd systems have @xmath21 hr orbital periods and they also have the lowest mass primaries .",
    "in addition , the lowest mass wds in double wd systems have @xmath88 .",
    "lower - mass objects may be produced in such systems but are currently undetected in the sdss and other spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the sample of elm wd merger systems will be significantly enlarged by our continuing elm survey based on sdss photometry .",
    "such a magnitude - limited survey will not suffer from the biases present in our current sample , and will provide invaluable information on the merger rates of elm wd systems and their contribution to underluminous sne and am cvn systems . furthermore , a large sample of elm wds and population synthesis models will improve our understanding of the cooling models for elm wds .",
    "we thank g. nelemans for providing his binary wd population synthesis model results , s. geier for the latest results from the spy survey , and d. koester for wd model spectra .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through the _ spitzer space telescope _ fellowship program , under an award from caltech .",
