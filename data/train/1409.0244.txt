    "the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite is a crucial tool for a huge number of experiments and measuring devices based on ultracold atoms . in a 1d mot ,",
    "atoms interact with a pair of counter - propagating , circularly polarized laser beams , each slightly red detuned from an atomic transition , and a magnetic field gradient sets up a spatially - dependent zeeman splitting of the transition .",
    "the red - detuning ensures that atoms are doppler cooled , and the combination of the red detuning , circular polarization , and zeeman shift , sets up an imbalance in the radiation pressure from the two beams , ensuring that atoms are always pushed towards the zero of magnetic field .",
    "a standard 3d mot repeats this arrangement in all three dimensions , using three orthogonal pairs of counter - propagating beams and a quadrupole magnetic field . in this way",
    ", large numbers of atoms can be captured from a hot gas , trapped in a small volume , typically less than 1 mm radius , and cooled to a low temperature , typically below 1mk .",
    "it is important to avoid optical pumping into a dark state , where for a given polarization the transition matrix element to all relevant excited states is zero . in almost all mots ,",
    "the main cooling cycle is a transition between lower and upper levels with angular momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for alkali atoms for example ,",
    "the cooling transition is typically the @xmath12 d@xmath13 transition .",
    "since there are no dark zeeman sub - levels in this case , the atoms are always in the cooling cycle . often , the upper state can decay to some other lower state , either a metastable excited state , or another hyperfine level of the ground state .",
    "repump lasers are then used to keep the atoms in the cooling cycle .",
    "these atomic mots have been extensively studied and are well understood .",
    "atomic mots where the cooling transition has @xmath14 are also sometimes used @xcite .",
    "examples are mots working on the @xmath15 d@xmath16 transition of alkali atoms .",
    "the confining forces in these mots tend to be weaker than in a normal atomic mot because an atom can not scatter photons continuously from any one beam without being optically pumped into a state that is dark to that beam , but bright to the opposing beam ( see section [ sec : angmomcases ] ) . in these cases",
    ", the orthogonal beams can be important in turning dark states into bright ones to set up a net restoring force .",
    "the changing magnetic field orientation and laser polarization seen by the atoms as they move through the mot can also play that role , and mixing of closely - spaced hyperfine levels by the magnetic field can contribute to the trapping force @xcite .",
    "though these more complicated mots have been studied , they are still not fully understood .",
    "an exciting recent advance is the laser cooling and magneto - optical trapping of molecules @xcite .",
    "a 3d mot of srf molecules has been demonstrated @xcite , as has the compression of a beam of yo molecules using magneto - optical forces @xcite .",
    "several lasers are used to drive multiple transitions , and to avoid branching to other rotational levels one deliberately chooses a cooling transition where the upper state angular momentum is less than that of the lower state . in this case",
    "it is challenging , but crucial , to understand the origin of the restoring forces that produce the mot .    here , we build a simple , intuitive understanding of how mots work in various angular momentum cases , find the correct polarizations for the laser beams in each case , and understand how the signs and magnitudes of the lower and upper - state magnetic g - factors influence the strength of the trapping force and the correct choice of polarization .",
    "we use a rate model to calculate the trapping forces for these various cases .",
    "we study how a rapid , synchronous reversal of the magnetic field gradient and laser polarizations , as used in @xcite , can increase the trapping forces in some cases .",
    "we consider the consequences of our findings for various molecules , model the arrangement used in @xcite to make a srf mot , and suggest how the confining forces for that mot can be increased .",
    "we consider an atom or molecule of mass @xmath17 that has a set of lower levels @xmath18 and upper levels @xmath19 .",
    "the angular frequency of the transition from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "the upper levels all share a common decay rate @xmath21 .",
    "the atom interacts with several laser beams .",
    "laser beam component @xmath22 has angular frequency @xmath23 and propagates in the direction of the unit vector @xmath24 .",
    "the frequencies are all similar , and so we use a single wavelength @xmath25 for all components .",
    "the mot is made using six orthogonal beams each containing @xmath26 frequencies , and so there are @xmath27 laser components .",
    "the laser beams and magnetic field of the mot are defined in a laboratory coordinate system whose axes ( @xmath28 ) are aligned with the k - vectors of the lasers .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the field gradient in the @xmath31-plane .",
    "the simulation is done in a local coordinate system whose @xmath32-axis is always in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the particles move slowly enough that they adiabatically follow changes in the field direction .",
    "the mot is simulated using rate equations for the position @xmath33 and velocity @xmath34 of the particle , for the populations @xmath35 and @xmath36 of each lower and upper level , and for the number of scattered photons @xmath37 : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath40 is the branching ratio for the spontaneous decay of level @xmath19 to level @xmath18 , and @xmath41 is the excitation rate between levels @xmath18 and @xmath19 driven by laser component @xmath22 .",
    "this excitation rate is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the saturation parameter , @xmath44 is the fractional strength of the transition being driven , @xmath45 is the detuning from the resonance angular frequency for a stationary particle at zero field , and @xmath46 is the zeeman shift of the transition angular frequency . for the small magnetic fields of a typical mot we take the zeeman shift to be linear , @xmath47 , where @xmath3 , @xmath7 are the g - factors and @xmath48 , @xmath49 the magnetic quantum numbers of the upper and lower levels .",
    "the saturation parameter is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the intensity of laser component @xmath22 , and @xmath52 is the saturation intensity for a two - level atom .",
    "the transition strength is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dipole moment operator , @xmath55 is the laser polarization in the local coordinate system , and the sum runs over all lower levels . from these definitions , it follows that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the rabi frequency at which the transition between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is being driven . the polarization of each laser component is specified relative to its own k - vector and is called @xmath58",
    "this is transformed into the local coordinate system via @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the cartesian rotation matrix , @xmath61 are the euler angles that rotate the laboratory z - axis onto the k - vector and @xmath62 are the euler angles that rotate the laboratory z - axis onto the magnetic field vector .",
    "the intensity distribution of each laser beam is a truncated gaussian @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the distance from the centre of the beam , @xmath65 is the @xmath66 radius , @xmath67 is a truncation radius , and @xmath68 is the power of the beam prior to truncation .    for many purposes , such as finding the capture velocity , the trapping frequency , the scattering rate , or the population distribution , the rate equations written above are adequate .",
    "however , they can not give the temperature limit of the mot since they do not reflect the randomness of the scattering . to capture this , the extra terms @xmath69 are added to the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : vprime ] ) , where @xmath70 are unit vectors whose orientations change randomly each time @xmath37 increases by 1 .",
    "these simulate the randomness of the momentum kicks due to absorption and spontaneous emission . with these terms",
    "included the integration has to be done in much smaller time steps , and so they are only included when their effects are of interest , e.g. for finding the temperature of the mot .",
    "it is often useful to compare the simulation results with the results of standard 1d mot theory @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the atom has an @xmath71 lower level , and an @xmath72 upper level with magnetic moment @xmath73 , and it interacts with two counter - propagating beams of wavevector @xmath74 and detuning @xmath75 .",
    "the acceleration is @xmath76 for small velocities and displacements , this can be written as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the trapping frequency in the z - direction , given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the damping coefficent given by @xmath81",
    "to build our understanding , we focus on simple cases with just two levels , a lower level of angular momentum @xmath10 and an upper level of angular momentum @xmath82 .",
    "we consider an atom at rest and displaced from the centre of the mot along any one of the principal axes .",
    "we refer to the two beams that propagate along this axis as the restoring and anti - restoring beams , where the former is the one whose radiation pressure pushes the atom back towards the centre .",
    "the other beams are called the orthogonal beams .",
    "all beams have the same frequency and are red - detuned from the atomic transition . in our local coordinate system",
    "defined by the magnetic field at the position of the atom , the zeeman sub - levels of the lower and upper states are labelled @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , and transitions are labelled @xmath85 according to whether @xmath86 .",
    "ground state and an @xmath87 excited state . in (",
    "a ) the g - factor is zero in the ground state , in ( b ) it is zero in the excited state , while in ( c ) it is positive in the excited state and negative in the ground state .",
    "the arrow indicates the frequency of red - detuned light.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    first consider the case where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is the simplest case where there can not be a dark state and where both states can have zeeman shifts .",
    "the restoring beam is polarized to drive @xmath90 transitions , while the anti - restoring beam drives @xmath91 transitions . suppose the lower state has no zeeman splitting , as illustrated in figure [ fig : f1tof2](a ) .",
    "the strongest transition is the one to @xmath92 because this is closest to resonance .",
    "only the restoring beam can drive a transition to this state .",
    "atoms are optically pumped into the @xmath93 state and then only interact with the restoring beam .",
    "this is the way a normal atomic mot works .",
    "the situation is not much changed when both upper and lower states have a positive g - factor . for @xmath94 nothing",
    "is changed , for @xmath95 the preference for scattering from the restoring beam is weakened , while for @xmath93 the preference is strengthened .",
    "now consider the case illustrated in figure [ fig : f1tof2](b ) where the upper state has no zeeman splitting .",
    "the transition from @xmath95 is strongest because it is closest to resonance .",
    "both the restoring and anti - restoring beams can drive transitions out of this state , because the upper state has both @xmath96 and @xmath97 available .",
    "the rate for the @xmath98 transition is 6 times higher , and so the anti - restoring beam dominates while the atom remains in @xmath95 .",
    "however , following excitation to @xmath97 the atom can reach @xmath93 and then the relative rates are exactly reversed . the fact that the excitation rate out of @xmath93 is slower than that out of @xmath95 is not relevant here",
    "the important point is the relative number of photons absorbed from each beam , and this is , on average , equal for the two beams . in this case",
    "the ground state with the highest population is @xmath93 , the excited states all have equal population , and there is no confining force .",
    "the argument is unchanged if the polarizations of the lasers are reversed , and the same argument also applies to all other angular momentum cases .",
    "if there is no zeeman splitting in the upper state there is , on average , no selectivity for one laser beam over the other , so there can be no mot .    finally consider the case where @xmath3 is positive and @xmath2 is negative .",
    "we may wonder whether the polarizations should be reversed in this case .",
    "they should not .",
    "let us keep the polarizations the same as before and analyze what happens .",
    "for @xmath94 nothing is changed relative to case ( a ) and the restoring beam will dominate .",
    "for @xmath95 the red - detuning once again ensures that the restoring beam dominates , with excitation to @xmath97 being favoured . for @xmath93",
    "the restoring beam will be favoured close to the centre where the field is small and the anti - restoring beam will be favoured further out where the zeeman shift is large enough to bring the @xmath91 transition into resonance . in this last case ,",
    "the upper state is @xmath97 which can decay to any of the lower states , and so an atom in @xmath93 soon finds itself in one of the other ground states where the restoring beam dominates always .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2 ] shows how the acceleration of a stationary atom depends on the axial distance from the mot centre , for various values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "these results are calculated using the model described in section [ sec : model ] applied to this angular momentum case .",
    "the mass , linewidth and transition wavelength are those of @xmath99na , the radial field gradient is @xmath100g / cm , the detuning is @xmath101 , the intensity is @xmath102 , the laser beams are @xmath90 polarized , and the beams are made sufficiently large that the intensity is nearly uniform across the whole distance range of interest .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2](a ) shows the acceleration profile in the case where @xmath103 , and for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "as the atom moves away from the centre @xmath104 first increases linearly , then reaches a maximum at the point where the zeeman shift of the @xmath92 level is approximately equal to the detuning , then gradually decreases .",
    "as @xmath6 is increased , the turning point moves inwards in proportion , but the maximum value of @xmath104 does not change .",
    "one finds the same dependence on the field gradient @xmath30 , because it is the product @xmath105 that matters .",
    "as expected , these profiles are similar to those obtained from standard 1d mot theory , equation ( [ eq : accel1d ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that the maximum value of @xmath104 in the figure is 3.6 times smaller than found from this equation .",
    "that is because the orthogonal laser beams partly saturate the transition , leading to a reduction in the scattering rate from the restoring beam , and because the orthogonal beams can drive @xmath106 transitions that pump population out of the @xmath93 state which has the highest scattering rate .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2](b ) shows the acceleration profile in the case where @xmath107 and for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "as argued above , there is no trapping when the upper level has no zeeman shift , and similarly the acceleration is small when @xmath6 is small . as @xmath6 increases towards 0.6",
    "there is an increasing preference to drive @xmath108 transitions , and so @xmath104 increases and its maximum value shifts to larger @xmath32 . for @xmath109",
    "the maximum acceleration is nearly constant , and the position of the maximum shifts inwards , similar to the behaviour seen for @xmath103 .",
    "note that the maximum acceleration is about 2.5 times larger than in case ( a ) . at the value of @xmath110 that brings the @xmath111 transition into resonance ,",
    "the zeeman splitting of the upper levels is @xmath112 . when @xmath103 this is always @xmath113 , but when @xmath114 and @xmath115 it is @xmath116 .",
    "this much larger splitting produces a stronger preference for scattering from the restoring beam , and therefore a stronger force .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2](c ) shows the acceleration profile in the case where @xmath117 and for various values of @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the maximum @xmath104 increases with @xmath6 over the whole range explored , because for @xmath117 , @xmath118 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "it tends towards @xmath119 in the limit of large @xmath3 , and so the maximum acceleration tends towards the value in case ( a ) . note that increasing @xmath3 also narrows the range of @xmath32 over which the acceleration is significant , reducing the mot capture radius .    near the centre of the mot",
    "the acceleration depends linearly on @xmath32 .",
    "its gradient is the square of the trapping frequency , @xmath120 , and this is found to be independent of @xmath2 . in 1d mot theory ,",
    "the trapping frequency is given by equation ( [ eq : trapfreq1d ] ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath121 is reduced because of the effects of the orthogonal beams , but the numerical model shows that its dependence on @xmath75 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 follows closely this standard expression .",
    "this is also true for the other angular momentum cases considered .",
    "next , consider the case where both ground and excited states have angular momentum @xmath72 , and where the lower state has no zeeman shift , as illustrated in figure [ fig : f1tof1](a ) .",
    "the polarizations of the laser beams are the same as before .",
    "suppose that there are no orthogonal laser beams .",
    "then , the transition out of @xmath95 can only be driven by the restoring beam , while the transition out of @xmath93 can only be driven by the anti - restoring beam . in both cases",
    "the excited state is @xmath97 which decays with equal probability to each of @xmath125 .",
    "it follows that the mean number of photons scattered from each beam is equal and there is no net force .",
    "the @xmath94 state plays no part , apart from an initial transient where population is pumped out of this state .",
    "the introduction of the orthogonal beams changes this picture .",
    "an atom in @xmath95 can interact with either the restoring beam or the orthogonal beams , with a preference for exciting to @xmath97 which is closer to resonance .",
    "the restoring beam drives this transition more strongly than any one of the orthogonal beams , but there are four orthogonal beams so it tends to even out",
    ". an atom in @xmath126 can interact with any of the beams , but is more likely to interact with the restoring beam than the anti - restoring beam because the @xmath127 transition is closest to resonance .",
    "an atom in @xmath93 can interact with the anti - restoring beam or the orthogonal beams , but only the orthogonal beams can drive the transition close to resonance and so they dominate . to complete the picture",
    "we need to know which of the three ground states is visited most often .",
    "there is a tendency to excite to @xmath128 , which then decays equally to @xmath129 .",
    "when the zeeman splitting and detuning are large , nearly half of all scattering events are driven from @xmath93 by the orthogonal beams , while the other half are from @xmath94 and are sometimes driven by the restoring beam but rarely by the anti - restoring beam .",
    "there is a net restoring force . for smaller zeeman splittings",
    "this trend applies more weakly , but in addition the @xmath95 state is sometimes visited and transitions out of this state can be driven by the restoring but not by the anti - restoring beam .     ground state and an @xmath72 excited state . in (",
    "a ) the g - factor is zero in the ground state , while in ( b ) it is zero in the excited state .",
    "the arrow indicates the frequency of red - detuned light.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    now consider what happens when only the lower state has a zeeman shift , as illustrated in figure [ fig : f1tof1](b ) . when @xmath95 transitions are driven by either the restoring or orthogonal beams .",
    "when @xmath94 transitions can be driven by any of the beams , and the scattering rates for the restoring and anti - restoring beams are equal .",
    "when @xmath93 transitions are driven by either the anti - restoring or orthogonal beams .",
    "each upper state decays to two lower states with equal probability and so the @xmath125 states are visited an equal number of times .",
    "it follows that there is no net force .",
    "it is possible to recover a net force however .",
    "the population tends to accumulate in @xmath93 because the excitation rate out of this state is slow , but the restoring force comes only from transitions out of @xmath95 .",
    "a net restoring force can be produced by rapidly switching the population back into @xmath95 each time it starts to build up in @xmath93 .",
    "this is equivalent to a synchronous reversal of the magnetic field gradient and laser beam polarizations , provided they are switched rapidly enough that the atomic state can not follow the change .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section [ sec : rapidswitch ] .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof1 ] shows how the acceleration depends on axial position for this angular momentum case , and for various values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "these curves , and the trends they display , are similar to those in figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2 ] which was discussed above .",
    "the main differences are featured in case ( b ) , where @xmath114 . here , when @xmath130 , the restoring force comes mainly from the @xmath131 transition at low field , and mainly from the @xmath132 transition at higher field .",
    "as @xmath3 increases , the latter transition comes into resonance for smaller values of @xmath110 and so the peak of @xmath104 moves inwards towards the trap centre .",
    "the maximum obtainable trapping force is reduced by a factor of about 4 relative to figure [ fig : accelcurvesf1tof2](b ) , because the atoms can not continuously scatter photons from the restoring beam without being pumped into a state that is dark to that beam .",
    "we found that in 1d the average force is zero when @xmath133 .",
    "this is special to that case , and is not true of other cases where @xmath134 .",
    "consider , for example , a 1d mot with @xmath135 . because the light is red - detuned , the restoring beam is favoured for all @xmath83 apart from @xmath136 .",
    "an atom will be optically pumped to @xmath137 by the restoring beam , and once in this state the anti - restoring beam will drive the transition to @xmath128 .",
    "that upper state decays to @xmath138 with probabilities 1/3 , 1/6 and 1/2 .",
    "because these probabilities are biased away from @xmath137 , it takes , on average , more scattering events to reach this state than it does to leave it .",
    "so there is a restoring force , even in 1d . in 3d , we find that the trapping force for @xmath135 is roughly half that found for @xmath133 , and higher values of @xmath139 give even weaker forces , but otherwise the characteristics are similar .",
    "consider now the case illustrated in figure [ fig : f2tof1 ] where the ground state has angular momentum @xmath141 and the excited state has @xmath142 .",
    "once again , suppose there is no zeeman splitting in the ground state .",
    "the transition to @xmath128 is driven most strongly because this transition is closest to resonance .",
    "this upper state decays 60% of the time to @xmath136 , 30% of the time to @xmath93 , and 10% to @xmath94 . the combination of the resonance condition and the branching ratios provide a strong tendency to optically pump to the negative @xmath83 states , particularly to @xmath137 .",
    "in fact , when the zeeman splitting is large , the atom hardly ever reaches the positive @xmath143 states , and 90% of all scattering events are from @xmath137 or @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", it must be advantageous for the restoring beam to drive @xmath91 transitions , requiring the the opposite polarization to the other cases considered .",
    "let s analyze in more detail what happens for each ground state with polarizations chosen this way .",
    "when @xmath144 the anti - restoring and orthogonal lasers tend to drive @xmath90 transitions , since these are closer to resonance , while the restoring laser does nothing .",
    "when @xmath93 the orthogonal lasers tend to drive the transition to @xmath128 . the restoring and orthogonal lasers can drive transitions to @xmath97 , but more weakly .",
    "when @xmath137 the orthogonal and restoring lasers drive the only possible transition .",
    "we see that for 3 out of the 5 lower states the anti - restoring beam dominates over the restoring beam . in the other 2 states the restoring beam dominates over the anti - restoring beam , although in one of these most scattering",
    "is from the orthogonal beams .",
    "nevertheless , the net effect is a restoring force because the @xmath145 states are visited more often than the others .",
    "ground state and an @xmath72 excited state . in (",
    "a ) the g - factor is zero in the ground state , while in ( b ) it is zero in the excited state .",
    "the arrow indicates the frequency of red - detuned light.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    now look at the case where there is no zeeman shift in the upper state , as shown in figure [ fig : f2tof1](b ) , and the laser polarizations are still reversed as above .",
    "when @xmath146 is positive the restoring beam can not act , when @xmath146 is negative the anti - restoring beam can not act , and when @xmath147 the scattering rates from the two beams are equal .",
    "the positive and negative @xmath146 are visited equally on average , since there is nothing to break the symmetry between them .",
    "so there is no net force .",
    "this is true for any choice of beam polarization .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesf2tof1 ] shows how the acceleration depends on the axial position in the case where @xmath148 and @xmath149 , with the restoring beams driving @xmath91 transitions .",
    "these curves are similar to those discussed for the other two angular momentum cases .",
    "we have seen that the strength of the restoring force in the mot depends on the angular momenta of the upper and lower states and on the ratio of their zeeman shifts .",
    "the restoring forces are weak when the zeeman shift of the upper state is small compared to that of the lower state .",
    "the correct choice of polarization depends on the sign of the g - factor in the upper state , but not on its sign in the lower state .",
    "table [ tab : accelsummary ] summarizes the correct choice of polarization for positive @xmath6 and for various angular momentum cases , and in each case gives the maximum force found for zero , positive , and negative values of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath6 is negative the polarizations should be reversed .",
    "it is interesting to compare the polarization rules summarized in table [ tab : accelsummary ] with experimental results . in @xcite , a sodium mot operating on the d@xmath16 line",
    "was reported , using two laser frequencies to drive transitions from both ground state hyperfine levels .",
    "mots were produced using four distinct configurations for the frequencies and polarizations of the lasers ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) , but no explanation was given as to why these configurations are the correct ones .",
    "all four configurations conform to the polarization rules of [ tab : accelsummary ] .",
    "note that the magneto - optical forces are unchanged if the detuning and polarizations are both reversed .",
    "a blue detuning heats the atoms and so is usually undesirable , but when there are closely spaced hyperfine components a blue detuning relative to some of the transitions may be inevitable , and this observation is then relevant .    .",
    "[ tab : accelsummary ] required polarization and maximum acceleration in a mot with lower and upper angular momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the notation @xmath85 means that , in a coordinate system with @xmath32-axis in the magnetic field direction , the restoring beams drive @xmath150 transitions .",
    "the polarizations are the correct ones for positive @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath3 is negative , they should be reversed .",

    "for caf , the zeeman - splitting in the a@xmath159 excited state is about 40 times smaller than in the x@xmath160 ground state , which is far too small for a dc mot to be feasible using this transition .",
    "rapid polarization switching can be used to avoid this problem , as discussed in section [ sec : rapidswitch ] .",
    "alternatively , the b@xmath161 state can be used for the main cooling transition , so that the upper and lower g - factors are comparable . the franck - condon factor between b@xmath162 and x@xmath162 is very close to 1 , and the transition from b to a , which would take molecules out of the cooling cycle , is strongly suppressed because both the transition dipole moment and the @xmath163 factor are small .",
    "this cooling scheme also has the advantage that each vibrational level of x can be driven to a different upper state , which increases the overall scattering rate ( see , for example , the appendix of @xcite ) .    for srf and yo",
    "the excited state zeeman splitting is about a tenth of the ground state splitting , good enough to make a weakly confining mot without using the rapid switching method .",
    "the trapping forces should be stronger again for ybf , whose excited state zeeman splitting is about a quarter of the ground state splitting .",
    "let us now focus on the specific case of a mot for srf , operating on the x@xmath164 to a@xmath165 transition , since this has recently been demonstrated @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the two lowest vibrational levels ( @xmath166 ) are both driven to the same upper level .",
    "decays to higher - lying vibrational levels ( @xmath167 ) are rare and are repumped through different vibrational levels of the a state .",
    "we neglect these rare decays which we expect to have very little influence .",
    "each vibrational level of the ground state has 4 levels due to the hyperfine and spin - rotation interactions , while the upper state has 2 hyperfine levels whose splitting is smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "this structure is shown in figure [ fig : srfschemes ] .",
    "the simulation takes into account the 4 zeeman sub - levels of the a state , and the 24 lower sub - levels of x ( 12 each for @xmath168 and 1 ) .",
    "the transition amplitudes between the lower and upper levels are calculated using the known franck - condon factors and standard angular momentum algebra ( see the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "the upper state g - factor is set to the value given in table [ tab : gfacs ] .",
    "the powers , detunings , and waist sizes of all the laser beams , and the magnetic field gradient , are all set to the values used in @xcite .",
    "the best choice of polarizations for driving the various transitions is far from obvious in the complicated case where all the transitions share a common upper level .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to follow the prescriptions for the individual angular momentum cases detailed above and summarized in table [ tab : accelsummary ] .",
    "since the upper state g - factor is negative , the restoring beams should drive @xmath108 transitions for the @xmath141 to @xmath142 system , and should drive @xmath169 transitions for all the other cases .",
    "these choices of polarizations are indicated in figure [ fig : srfschemes](i ) .",
    "the acceleration as a function of @xmath32 for this arrangement is shown by curve ( i ) in figure [ fig : accelcurvessrfschemes ] . from the slope of this curve close to the origin we find a trapping frequency of @xmath170hz .",
    "although the @xmath66 radius of the beams is only 7 mm , there is a confining force all the way out to @xmath171 mm and beyond , showing that the orthogonal beams are not essential for setting up the confining force in this complicated case .",
    "reversing the polarizations of any one of the laser components reduces the trapping frequency , suggesting that this arrangement is indeed the best one .",
    "reversing the polarization of the component that drives the transition from @xmath141 has a particularly strong effect , reducing @xmath78 by a factor of 3 , suggesting that it is mainly this transition that produces the confinement .",
    "it is difficult in practice to arrange the setup shown in figure [ fig : srfschemes](i ) . the actual scheme used in the experiment @xcite",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : srfschemes](ii ) .",
    "the four frequency components shown in red are identically polarized , and are derived from a single laser ( called @xmath172 ) using the 1st and 2nd order sidebands of an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) .",
    "they primarily drive the transitions from the @xmath87 , @xmath71 and upper @xmath72 levels .",
    "an additional laser @xmath173 , oppositely polarized , drives the transition from the lower @xmath72 level .",
    "the transitions from @xmath174 are driven by a third laser ( @xmath175 ) , and the components generated by an eom modulated so that all four components are close to resonance . simulating this setup",
    ", we obtain the acceleration shown by curve ( ii ) in figure [ fig : accelcurvessrfschemes ] . for @xmath176 mm ,",
    "this arrangement produces a confining force , and close to the origin we find a trapping frequency of @xmath177hz , about twice the value actually found in the experiment .",
    "this @xmath78 is only a little smaller than in case ( i ) , probably because the beam addressing the @xmath87 transition has the same polarization as in ( i ) , and provides most of the confinement .",
    "as in the experiment , the mot disappears if all the polarizations are reversed .",
    "it also disappears if the polarization of @xmath173 is reversed , or if this laser is turned off , showing the importance of this extra frequency component in this scheme . at larger distances from the centre",
    "the force becomes de - confining .",
    "this happens close to the @xmath110 field where the upper @xmath72 , @xmath178 level crosses the @xmath179 levels , and this seems to be the reason for the change in the sign of the force . simulating a distribution of molecules in the mot , the mean scattering rate is found to be @xmath180 photons / s , consistent with the value found in the experiment .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is @xmath181mk , which is about half the measured temperature .",
    "the damping coefficient in the simulation is found to be @xmath182s@xmath183 , a factor of 15 higher than in the experiment .",
    "figure [ fig : srfschemes](iii ) shows an alternative way of using @xmath172 and @xmath173 so that the setup more closely approximates scheme ( i ) . here",
    ", the eom is modulated at 42.9mhz and the centre frequency chosen to minimize the quadrature sum of the detunings from the @xmath71 and @xmath72 components .",
    "the @xmath173 laser is tuned into resonance with the @xmath87 component .",
    "then , all components are detuned by @xmath184 .",
    "the acceleration curve found for this setup is shown by curve ( iii ) in figure [ fig : accelcurvessrfschemes ] .",
    "its gradient close to the origin is almost identical to case ( i ) and is an improvement over case ( ii ) .",
    "the force is also confining over the whole range of @xmath32 explored , and this may improve the capture volume of the mot .",
    "in all three cases considered , the trapping forces are weak relative to a conventional atomic mot .",
    "this is partly because of the small upper state @xmath185-factor , and partly because 3 out of the 4 transitions being driven have @xmath14 which always give weaker confinement relative to the preferred case of @xmath186 ( see section [ sec : angmomcases ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the rapid switching method will increase the confining forces considerably .    .",
    "parameters are @xmath187 nm , @xmath188mhz , @xmath189amu , @xmath190g / cm , @xmath191 mm . the power in each of the 4 ( or 5 ) components of the main cooling cycle is 50mw , and in each of the 4 components of the vibrational repump is 40mw.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "this paper explains the essential mechanisms of magneto - optical trapping for atoms and molecules that have complex energy level structures .",
    "we have used qualitative pictures to build an understanding , and have given quantitative results based on rate equations .",
    "this model can not capture the effects of coherences between levels which may be important in a real mot .",
    "of particular relevance is coherent population trapping into dark states , and the mechanisms that destabilize those dark states .",
    "we have assumed linear zeeman shifts , neglecting the mixing of hyperfine states by the magnetic field which is know to be important for closely - spaced hyperfine levels @xcite .",
    "we have also neglected the interference between the laser beams , which sets up polarization gradients that are likely to be important . though these effects may change some of the quantitative results obtained here , they are unlikely to change the main conclusions which are based on simple considerations about how the trapping forces arise .",
    "we now summarize those conclusions .",
    "the strongest forces are always obtained for @xmath186 , because only then can the atoms interact continuously with the restoring beam without being pumped into a state that is dark to that beam .",
    "we find that when @xmath192 the laser polarizations should be chosen as in a normal atomic mot , but when @xmath193 they have to be reversed .",
    "the polarizations also have to be reversed if the light is blue - detuned , or if the upper - state g - factor is negative , but not if the lower state g - factor is negative .",
    "these polarization rules explain some previously unexplained mot configurations that appear in the literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "when the upper state has no zeeman splitting , the forces average to zero .",
    "similarly , when @xmath194 the trapping forces are very weak .    in cases where the confining forces are weak ,",
    "either because of a small upper state g - factor , or because @xmath14 , a stronger force can be generated by rapidly and synchronously reversing the field gradient and laser polarizations .",
    "the switch must be fast enough that the change is non - adiabatic , and the strongest force will be obtained when the switching period is comparable to the optical pumping time .",
    "figure [ fig : accelcurvesrapidswitching ] shows the forces obtained from simulations where this rapid switching method is applied .",
    "these conclusions are particularly relevant for magneto - optical trapping of molecules where the laser cooling uses a @xmath195 transition .",
    "a pure @xmath9 state has a very small g - factor , too small to make a dc mot .",
    "we have estimated the actual g - factor for several relevant molecules , and find that it can be far larger than that because of mixing with a nearby @xmath8 state . for srf , the upper state g - factor is large enough to produce a weakly - confining mot , as observed experimentally @xcite . using the rate equation model , we find a trapping frequency , scattering rate , and equilibrium temperature all within a factor of 2 of those found in the experiment .",
    "however , the damping coefficient found in this simulation is an order of magnitude higher than measured experimentally .",
    "we suggest that the polarizations used in @xcite are not the optimum ones , and suggest a simple change to the setup that will match the optimum arrangement more closely . this alternative setup should give a higher trapping frequency and larger capture volume .",
