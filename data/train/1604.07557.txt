    "the conversion of heat into useful energy or work is at the very heart of the second law of thermodynamics@xcite , rendering the design and functionality of thermodynamic engines a recurrent topic .",
    "although dealing with such seemingly prosaic issues as the efficiency of a machine @xcite , the second law implies drastic consequences , telling which processes are allowed to occur in nature , an example being the requirement of non - decreasing entropy in an isolated system .",
    "new challenges appear when taking the second law of thermodynamics into the quantum regime .",
    "the topic has likewise caught the interest of the quantum - information and quantum - engineering communities , with recent works addressing both fundamental @xcite and practical @xcite issues . equally pertinent to the topic",
    "is maxwell s demon @xcite and its taming by landauer s principle @xcite , adding the concept of information to the discussion @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we invoke a quantum demon that makes use of quantum purity to decrease the entropy and increase the coherence of an energetically isolated system . starting from a fundamental observation in quantum information theory , stating that the entropy is non - decreasing in a unital quantum channel @xcite , we search for the characteristics of a non - unital quantum channel that allows for a maximal decrease of entropy in an isolated system .",
    "we find that such a non - unital quantum channel involves a quantum demon that is swapping external pure quantum states against mixed system states , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "we present three specific examples for such demons , two mesoscopic systems using a spin or a double quantum - dot as part of the demon that imprints a coherent state on an incoherent electron ( and thus decreases the electron s entropy ) , and a four - qubit system constituting a quantum thermodynamic engine with separated energy and entropy cycles .",
    "a fully isolated quantum system evolves unitarily and hence its entropy remains constant , rendering the second law a triviality .",
    "a non - trivial setting is defined by an open quantum system .",
    "here , we have in mind a system that is energetically isolated ( and keeps a fixed particle number ) but can decrease its entropy through entanglement with its environment .",
    "this entanglement between the system and the environment can be induced with the help of a phase - like interaction .",
    "importantly , such a phase - exchange mechanism does not require an exchange of energy , thus modifying the concept of classical isolation when dealing with an open quantum system .",
    "indeed , it is well known that typical quantum systems become more rapidly entangled through a phase - exchange process than through a relaxation process , as prominently expressed by the scale separation of the corresponding relaxation times for phase ( @xmath0 ) and energy ( @xmath1 ) in quantum engineered systems .",
    "extensions of the second law accounting for the presence of classical ( as opposed to quantum ) correlations between the system and an information reservoir has recently been discussed in refs .",
    "in a typical situation , the quantum system interacts with a large environment that induces dephasing , eliminating the off - diagonal components of the system s density matrix and increasing its entropy .",
    "however , if the environment is a small and controllable quantum system , we will show below that one can tune the interaction between the system and the environment in such a way as to decrease the system s entropy .",
    "furthermore , using a phase exchange mechanism without energy exchange with the environment , such a decrease in entropy leads to an apparent contradiction to the traditional classical formulation of the second law . in our discussion below",
    ", this entropy decrease will be achieved by a quantum demon using a swap operation in order to exchange purity ( or coherence ) between the micro environment and the quantum system . including the micro environment in the entropy balance of the grand system reestablishes the second law ( via landauer s principle ) in a proper way .",
    "the standard description of the above situation ( an open quantum system initially disentangled from its environment ) is given by a _",
    "quantum channel _ @xmath2 . in its mathematical formulation",
    ", this is a completely positive , trace - preserving map that transforms the initial density matrix @xmath3 of the quantum system to a new density matrix @xmath4 . in our physical context",
    ", @xmath5 describes the evolution of the system s density matrix , @xmath6 \\equiv \\phi_t ( \\hat\\rho_0)$ ] , under the inclusion of the environment ( @xmath7 denotes the evolution of the grand system ) .",
    "the entropy of such an open quantum system is not conserved ,",
    "@xmath8 \\neq s(\\hat\\rho_0)$ ] , and actually can both increase and decrease .",
    "quantum information theory then offers the remarkable statement that the entropy gain is bounded from below , @xmath8 - s(\\hat\\rho_0 ) \\geq -\\mathrm{tr } \\bigl\\{[\\phi(\\hat\\rho_0 ) ] \\,\\ln \\phi(\\mathds{1}))\\bigr\\}$ ] .",
    "it follows that a special subclass of quantum channels which preserve the identity operator , @xmath9 , has a non - negative entropy gain , @xmath10 and hence @xmath8 - s(\\hat\\rho_0 ) \\geq 0 $ ] .",
    "a quantum system whose evolution can be described by a an identity - preserving quantum channel evolves with a non - decreasing entropy , @xmath8 \\geq s(\\hat\\rho_0)$ ] ; such a quantum channel is called unital .",
    "it turns out that for finite dimensional quantum systems , unitality is not only a sufficient but also a necessary condition for a non - negative entropy gain . indeed , if a @xmath11-dimensional quantum system evolves with non - decreasing entropy for any initial state @xmath3 , then it does so also for the completely chaotic state @xmath12 and therefore @xmath13 \\geq s(\\hat\\rho_c)$ ] .",
    "since the chaotic state @xmath14 has maximal possible entropy @xmath15 one has @xmath13 = k_\\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle b } \\ln(n)$ ] and hence @xmath16 , that proves the unitality of @xmath2 .",
    "these considerations tell us that in order to find an isolated finite - dimensional quantum system whose entropy decreases under its evolution , we have to search for a non - unital energy - conserving quantum channel and a suitable initial state .",
    "note , that unitality does not imply energy conservation of a quantum channel .",
    "indeed , consider a quantum channel @xmath17 which eliminates all off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and imposes an arbitrary permutation @xmath18 of its diagonal elements .",
    "this quantum channel is unital , however , the permutation of the diagonal elements in an energy representation does not conserve the total energy of the quantum system .    the existence of non - unital energy - conserving quantum channels that reduce the entropy has been pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] : scattering an electron in a three - terminal mesoscopic conductor suitably interacting with a spin , reduces the entropy of the outgoing state with respect to the incoming one .",
    "below , we investigate the functionality of such a quantum channel in more detail and find conditions and specific examples that lead to a maximal decrease of entropy .",
    "we will present two mesoscopic scattering setups that define such energy - conserving non - unital quantum channels with initial states that evolve with maximal decreasing entropy . in both examples ,",
    "we consider a four - lead reflectionless beam splitter and a general incoming electronic state @xmath19 that is scattered by the symmetric splitter .",
    "the system is augmented by a qubit acting as the microscopic environment .",
    "the interaction between the qubit and the scattering electron is arranged in such a way as to define a non - unital quantum channel that decreases the entropy of the outgoing state @xmath20 with respect to the incoming one , @xmath21 , without exchange of energy between the electron and the qubit . in the first example , the qubit is given by a spin , prepared in a suitable state , that interacts with electrons propagating in two of the four leads , thereby executing two non - commuting operations on the corresponding components  the non - commutativity of the two operations as derived from the non - unitality condition is a central feature of this setup . in the second example , we replace the spin by a double - quantum - dot that is more easily manipulated in a realistic system . here",
    ", the quantum dot exerts the identical operation on the electron , once in the incoming and a second time in the outgoing lead , however , suitably rotating the double - dot s state in between the two interaction events renders the two operations on the electron effectively non - commuting . within the mesoscopic transport setting , the reduced entropy in the outgoing lead corresponds to an increase in coherence of the outgoing electron state , where the attained coherence is provided by the demon .",
    "the concept may be useful in locally generating a coherent state of a flying qubit using the purity of a ( usually more stable ) stationary qubit . in order to test the functionality of such a device ,",
    "we propose to analyze this imposed coherence in a mach - zehnder setup .    analyzing the functionality of these devices in terms of a quantum algorithm , we find that the various steps in the protocol exchange the quantum states of the system and the demon . rather than a standard swap @xcite ,",
    "our considerations lead to a partial swap operation ( pswap ) that exchanges states in one sector of the hilbert space , while producing an incomplete swap ( a swap up to a not operation ) in the remaining part of the hilbert space .",
    "while a conventional swap operation also achieves the functionality of the non - unital quantum channel , its physical implementation is more demanding within the context of the present paper .",
    "the purification of a quantum state in a demon - assisted process can be used in the construction of a quantum thermodynamic engine .",
    "the discussion of quantum thermodynamic processes has continuously progressed over the past two decades , see [ ] for a recent review .",
    "quantum thermodynamic machines usually involve hot and cold ( switchable ) thermal reservoirs in combination with a ( spectrally tunable ) quantum system as an operating medium , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] , often operating in an autonomous manner @xcite . here , we focus on a class of machines that make use of a swap operation between states of different purity .",
    "this operation is conveniently described within the framework of maxwell s demon @xcite .",
    "the demon s original@xcite resource is the ability to distinguish particle motion such as to transfer them unidirectionally between two adjacent volumes , thereby reducing the system s entropy without investing work .",
    "the violation of the second law in the restricted system then is cured by going over to a larger system including the maxwell demon .",
    "this is the essence of landauer s principle , @xcite stating that resetting the demon s memory costs an entropy @xmath22 per decision .",
    "this entropy has to be picked up by a second reservoir , e.g. , at a lower temperature @xmath23 , and the putative perpetuum mobile of the second kind transforms into a conventional carnot machine .    through swapping the ( less pure ) system- with a purer demon state",
    ", our quantum demon provides the entropy required to have the machine run with only one thermal reservoir , thus replacing maxwell s classical demon in a quantum thermodynamic engine .",
    "this idea has been introduced early on by lloyd@xcite in his construction of a spin - based nmr demon and a proposal for a quantum thermodynamic engine .",
    "an atom - based quantum heat engine transforming heat from one reservoir into work has been proposed by scully @xcite , with the negentropy @xcite consumed in the cycle corresponding to a reservoir of demon qubits within our language .",
    "quantum heat engines assisted by a similar quantum demon have been described by quan _",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "[ ] , and more recently by diaz de la cruz and martin - delgado @xcite .",
    "the swap operation is a central element in algorithmic cooling , e.g. , of spins in nmr spectroscopy or for nmr based quantum computation @xcite as well as in the discussion of the smallness of quantum thermodynamic machines @xcite .",
    "the swap - based quantum heat engines proposed so far involve different characteristics and functionalities .",
    "e.g. , the engines in refs.involve working- and demon qubits with gapped spectra and a swap between two thermal states .",
    "in such a setup the injected heat is only partly transformed into work .",
    "this is due to the energy exchange between working- and demon qubits in the swap operation , always reducing the work ( or incoming heat ) by a waste heat .",
    "a setup which does not involve an energy exchange with the demon qubit has been proposed in ref .. this engine makes use of energy - degenerate working- and demon qubits , with the work extracted in a polarization / depolarization process , which requires a slow ( adjabatic ) process .    in our version of a demon - assisted thermodynamic engine , we make use of a partial swap ( pswap ) operation exchanging the pure state of an energy - degenerate demon qubit ( the dit ) with the ( non - degenerate ) working qubit s ( the wit s ) thermally excited state in an autonomous process .",
    "the exchange of quantum states in the pswap operation transforms the wit s thermal energy into the directed energy of a pure excited wit state .",
    "the wit s energy then can be extracted and used with the help of suitable quantum manipulations , while the wit s entropy is carried away by the dit after the pswap . while the pswap exchanges the entropies ( or purities ) of the wit and dit , the wit s and dit s energies are separately conserved .",
    "the separation into distinct energy and entropy cycles with no energy transfer in between then is the most interesting feature of our quantum - thermodynamic engine . in particular , considering only the energy cycle of the wit , it turns out that the local heat - to - work transfer operates with unit efficiency , i.e. , the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoir by the wit can be fully converted into directed work .",
    "furthermore , the entropy cycle where the dit is reprepared for the next round of operation can be run separately , in time or space , from the working cycle of the engine ; alternatively , the dits can be provided from a previously prepared reservoir of dit states . on the other hand , combining the outcome of both the energy and entropy cycles , i.e. , accounting for the state changes of both the wit and the dit , the second law and landauer s principle are fully respected and the resulting overall efficiency is smaller than the one of a carnot machine .    in the following section [ sec : spin ] ,",
    "we introduce an electronic scattering problem which includes the interaction with an auxiliary spin ( our first type of demon ) and formulate the process in the language of a quantum channel to derive the conditions for an energy - preserving and entropy - decreasing non - unital quantum channel . in section [ sec : dd ] , we proceed with the discussion of a more practical setup using a quantum double - dot as the demon qubit and proceed to describe the functionality of this non - unital quantum channel in terms of a quantum circuit , see sec .",

    "non - trivial , one has to replace the classical concept of an ` isolated system ' with an energy - isolated but open quantum system that can entangle with its ( micro-)environment .",
    "this implies allowing a phase - exchange with the environment .",
    "furthermore , the environment and its interaction with the system has to be properly engineered  rather than an uncontrolled macroscopic environment inducing incoherence , we had to consider a properly designed micro - environment .    with these prerequisites in mind and starting from the quantum - information - theoretic insight that unital quantum channels produce an evolution with non - decreasing entropy , we have searched for an energy - conserving non - unital quantum channel to reach our goal .",
    "furthermore , we have considered a minimal two - qubit mesoscopic setting with a scattering electron ( a flying system - qubit ) that interacts with a micro - environment in the form of a spin ( the demon qubit ) , interacting with the electron s current via its magnetic field .",
    "this approach naturally has led us to a process where the electron  spin ( or system  demon ) interaction generates two non - commuting rotations of the spin .",
    "an alternative setup with the spin replaced by a double - dot qubit allows for two equal interaction events but requires a qubit rotation in between , ultimately producing two non - commuting operations on the double - dot as well .",
    "the analysis of these specific mesoscopic examples in terms of a quantum circuit has revealed a general scheme or algorithm that exerts a partial swap operation between the system and demon qubits .",
    "swapping the system state against a purer or less mixed environmental state naturally explains the system s reduction in entropy or increase in coherence , where the latter is more easily observed in a direct interference experiment .",
    "starting and ending with product states , the pswap process ultimately does not entangle the system with its environment . while the system state can be chosen arbitrary , i.e. , a pure superposition state or any mixed state",

    "furthermore , within our scheme , the requirement of no net energy exchange between the system and the micro - environment is guaranteed by using an environmental qubit with energy - degenerate states .",
    "note that the conservation of the subsystem s individual energies is a subtle issue as the partition of the interaction energy is not clear .",
    "we thus have used either a phase interaction , where this question does not appear at all , or have focused on the energy conservation between initial and final states .",
    "the insight that the system s entropy decrease is based on a swap of states makes sure that nothing mysterious happens with the second law of thermodynamics , as the overall entropy of system plus micro - environment is conserved .",
    "rather , the micro - environment assumes the role of a quantum maxwell demon and in this terminology the honoring of the second law corresponds to landauer s principle applied in the restauration of the demon qubits .",
    "a number of designs for quantum thermodynamic engines have been proposed , including such that make use of swap operations .",
    "having focused on energy - isolated systems , our approach naturally has lead us to a design where the working ( or system ) cycle is energy - separated from the demon cycle .",
    "this feature provides the possibility to feed a heat engine with one local thermal reservoir , while providing purity from a distant source that can be handled independently .",
    "such a design is useful when the thermal- to directed - energy conversion should be free from ( uncontrolled ) waste heat . as an alternative ,",
    "one might trade the entropy in the thermally excited state against entropy stored in other , e.g. , orbital @xcite , degrees of freedom of the same system . analyzing the practical aspects of our design , we have found that the best machine is not the ideal one involving pure demon qubits , but that some degree of incoherence is favorable , both in terms of efficiency and power .",

    ", maxwell s demon has been a fascinating concept , despite his imprisonment by landauer s principle .",
