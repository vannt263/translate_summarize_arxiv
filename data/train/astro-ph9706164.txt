    "in studies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , much attention has been paid to `` unified '' schemes ( e.g. antonucci & miller 1985 ; antonucci 1993 ) that explain the observed differences among the classes of seyferts based on our viewing angle to the nucleus . in these models ,",
    "an optically thick torus with a radius of about 1 pc surrounds the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "when our line of sight intercepts this torus , the central continuum source and the blr are hidden from our view and we see only the type 2 spectrum from the narrow line region ( nlr ) .    far fewer investigations have focused on obscuration on a larger scale .",
    "keel ( 1980 ) found that optically - selected ( mostly type 1 ) seyferts tend to avoid host galaxies with axial ratio @xmath1 , i.e. they are rarely found in edge - on galaxies .",
    "by contrast , hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) selected seyferts show no such bias ( lawrence & elvis 1982 ) .",
    "lawrence & elvis concluded that optically - selected samples must suffer biases due to obscuration in a flattened configuration parallel to the disk of the host galaxy .",
    "this and subsequent studies indicated that the obscuring material is likely inside or at the outer edge of the blr ( e.g. de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) , though a more recent look suggested that the obscuring material might extend into the nlr ( kirhakos & steiner 1990a ) .    to investigate this question further and to avoid the problems intrinsic to studying heterogeneous samples , mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) compiled statistics on several sets of agn selected in different wavelength regimes .",
    "they found an excess of face - on spirals hosting both type 1 _ and _ type 2 agn for a spectroscopically - selected sample .",
    "therefore , a significant amount of dust in the galaxy plane must cover at least part of the nlr , i.e. , @xmath2 several magnitudes out to @xmath3 .",
    "they also found an excess of face - on spirals hosting soft x - ray selected agn , and used it to estimate the column density along the line of sight to the x - ray continuum source , inferring @xmath4 at scales @xmath5 . in both regimes , the aspect ratio ( i.e. height - to - thickness ) of the obscuring material is @xmath6 .",
    "a recent investigation by maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) provides preliminary evidence that this additional component of obscuration might explain the axial ratio distributions and the spectral characteristics of intermediate seyferts . in their model , a line of sight that intercepts the plane of the galaxy but not the inner torus would make a seyfert 1 appear as a 1.8 or 1.9 ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) also present a theoretical model for the origin of geometrically thick , 100 pc - scale obscuring material in the context of tidal disruption of giant molecular clouds approaching the central compact object .",
    "we stress that the galaxy inclination statistics are telling us about obscuring material that is distinct from , and not necessarily aligned with , the canonical torus of unification models .",
    "radio maps and hubble space telescope images indicate that the pc - scale torus of the unified model is not preferentially aligned with the larger scale galaxy disk ( schmitt  1996 ; wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ; ulvestad & wilson 1984 ) .",
    "seyfert 2 s are often found in face - on spiral disks and in the unified model , this means that the torus is in fact perpendicular to the host - galaxy disk .",
    "the strongest limit placed by mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) on the column density in the galaxy s disk was based on a sample of agn serendipitously discovered by the _ einstein _ ipc and reported by malkan , margon , & chanan ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , the malkan  selection process might have eliminated _ a priori _ edge - on galaxies for which the x - rays got through but for which emission lines were absorbed , thus precluding their identification as agn . in this paper",
    ", we use a new , complete , well - defined , soft x - ray sample of agn from the _ einstein _ slew survey ( elvis  1992 ; plummer  1994 ) .",
    "we measure axial ratios from digitized sky survey ( dss ) images and from new ccd images .",
    "this soft x - ray sample allows us to probe column densities in between those previously examined in uv - excess and hard x - ray samples .",
    "our sample was chosen from the catalog of the _ einstein _ slew survey in the soft x - ray band of 0.2 - 3.5 kev ( elvis  1992 , plummer  1994 ) .",
    "this survey has a flux limit of approximately @xmath7 ( elvis  1992 ) and is well - suited for defining a sample because of its extensive sky coverage .",
    "it maps about 50% of the sky , and contains 809 sources , 147 of which are classified as agn .",
    "the objects were identified as agn by correlation with pre - existing catalogs , or by examination of new spectra ( perlman  1996 ; huchra , schachter , & remillard private communication ) .",
    "the most important requirement for our sample is that the objects be nearby enough to resolve the host galaxy of the agn in dss images , because undersampling can lead to errors in axial ratio measurements .",
    "we restricted our sample to slew survey agn with @xmath0 , leaving us with 96 objects .",
    "the mean and median redshift for this final sample is @xmath8 , at which distance a galaxy diameter of 25 kpc corresponds to an angle of 34  ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is approximately the size of @xmath10 , the diameter at the b=@xmath11 isophote , for a typical spiral galaxy .",
    "although the slew survey objects have been mostly identified , there still remain 129 objects without known optical counterparts .",
    "we examined dss images of all of these fields to make sure that there are not significant numbers of @xmath0 agn among the unidentified objects .",
    "we checked within the 95% confidence limit of the _ einstein _ position ( 2  radius ; elvis  1992 ) for galaxies with apparent sizes @xmath12 , or approximately @xmath13 for a @xmath14 galaxy .",
    "there were only three galaxies satisfying these criteria , and only one of these three is edge - on .",
    "we conclude that our sample is at least 97% complete for @xmath0 , and that there is an insignificant number of potentially active edge - on galaxies with @xmath0 among the unidentified fields of the slew survey .",
    "a more subtle concern in our sample selection was the identification of 35 slew survey objects that were classified as `` normal '' ( i.e. non - agn ) galaxies .",
    "we are testing for obscuring material in the galaxy s disk that can hide emission from the nuclear region .",
    "it is possible that x - rays from an agn could penetrate this obscuring material , whereas visible light would be attenuated enough to hide the emission lines we use to identify an agn .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect to observe many slew survey `` normal '' galaxies to be hidden agn seen at high inclination . to test this possibility , we determined axial ratios for 20 of the 26 non - agn spiral galaxies identified in the slew survey ( the other 6 were too small , nebulous , or disturbed for a reliable measurement ) .",
    "the highly inclined members of this population are not likely to be hidden agn ",
    "the 4 objects with @xmath15 are : the well - known starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 , the very nearby galaxy ngc2903 , and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "we conclude that there are not significant numbers of agn with edge - on galaxies hidden in this subsample .",
    "the final agn sample is listed in table 1 .",
    "catalog designations , axial ratios , and redshifts were extracted from ned when available , and supplemented with data from new spectra obtained as part of the slew survey follow - up .",
    "we mark in table 1 the 19 objects with @xmath16 that were not known as agn before the slew survey . of the 96 agn in our sample ,",
    "only seven are known or probable type 2 s ( table 1 ) .",
    "such a small fraction of seyfert 2 s in a soft x - ray sample is not surprising given the known high x - ray absorption columns through the pc - scale torus ( @xmath17 ; awaki  1991 ) .",
    "visible images of all galaxies in the sample were extracted from the dss using the software package _",
    "getimage._. the digitized images had a resolution of 17 per pixel , with typical fwhm in the range of @xmath18 .",
    "previous studies of galaxy inclination statistics ( binney & devaucouleurs 1981 ) have measured isophotes out to @xmath13 so we tested our images to ensure we could measure isophotes at least as far .",
    "comparison of northern hemisphere dss images with ccd test images from the 48  telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) on mt .",
    "hopkins , az , showed that the northern dss outer isophotes reach regions of surface brightness corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "the southern hemisphere dss plates go slightly deeper , so all of the dss images are of an appropriate depth for this work . for four of the objects ( denoted ** in table 1 ) , we computed axial ratios based on h - band images from mcleod & rieke ( 1994 ) .",
    "these objects are fairly distant and have very bright nuclei , so the high - resolution deep images were used to obtain better accuracy .",
    "the images were all processed using the _ ellipse _ task in iraf to fit elliptical isophotes at increasing radii to each galaxy .",
    "the isophote fits were carried out to the level at which the average signal in an isophote was slightly larger than the rms deviation of the flux in the isophote , i.e. signal - to - noise approximately unity .",
    "the outermost ellipses were used to determine the axial ratio of the host galaxy . on average , the formal ellipticity error generated by the fitting algorithm was @xmath20 , which is greater than the difference in @xmath21 between consecutive isophotes at outer radii .",
    "the axial ratios are given in table 1 .",
    "for about 25% of the sample , we were unable to measure a reliable axial ratio . in five cases",
    "a foreground object contaminated the galaxy ( denoted `` f '' in table 1 ) . in 16 cases the object was too small or stellar ( `` s '' ) ;",
    "all of these are substantially more distant than the median redshift for the sample . in five additional cases the object was morphologically peculiar or interacting ( `` m '' ) . for six very nearby galaxies that were bigger than our images we simply adopted the ned value of b / a .",
    "a histogram of axial ratios of the remaining 74 galaxies is shown in figure [ fig - hist]a .",
    "there is an obvious deficiency of galaxies with small axial ratios .",
    "one test of the accuracy of our fits is to compare our ratios to those objects in the sample with previously measured axial ratios found in ned ( usually from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies , devaucouleurs  1991 , hereafter rc3 ) and listed in table 1 .",
    "the axial ratio agreement is excellent : the difference between our value and ned s value has a mean of 0.02 and standard deviation of 0.12 , as expected from the ellipse fitting uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that our axial ratios are accurate to @xmath22 .",
    "two of the three most discrepant points are easily reconciled : the multiple `` nuclei '' of interacting galaxy 1es0655@xmath23542 bias the measurement so we discard this object from our final analysis ; for 1es0403@xmath24373 we noted that our resolution is poor , and hence we adopt the smaller ned value for the analysis . for 1es0057@xmath23315 , however , we see no obvious reason for a discrepancy . we believe our measurement is robust and",
    "use it in our analysis .",
    "the fraction of objects for which our axial ratios are larger than ned s is too small to change the character of the @xmath21 distribution .",
    "the 17 pixels of the dss generally do not fully sample the seeing profiles of the original plates . to understand the effects of the poss s resolution limits for the more distant agn in our sample",
    ", we obtained 15 resolution ccd images at the flwo 48  telescope for 10 of the more distant agn ( denoted * in table 1 ) .",
    "the average difference in @xmath21 derived from poss images and ccd images was within the expected error margin of the ellipse fitting procedure .",
    "however , there is still the possibility that both sets of data undersample the galaxy images .",
    "we do see edge - on galaxies of similar size to the seyfert hosts in the dss images , but a bright seyfert nucleus could artificially inflate the axial ratio for more distant objects .",
    "figure [ fig - zdist ] is a plot of the axial ratios of the galaxies in our sample versus their redshifts .",
    "the excess of round galaxies is seen for the whole range of @xmath25 and is not solely a distance - dependent selection effect .",
    "however , the bias is possibly not as strong for @xmath26 , and many of the objects in that range have already been discarded by us because they were too compact for a reliable measurement .",
    "therefore , we will define below a `` most conservative sample '' containing only the 44 objects with @xmath27 .",
    "axial ratios for the `` whole sample '' of 74 agn for which we have measurements are shown in figure [ fig - hist]a .",
    "for comparison , we plot in figure [ fig - hist]d the distribution derived by fasano  ( 1993 ) based on their analysis of @xmath28 randomly oriented spiral galaxies drawn from the rc3 catalog .",
    "the distribution shows a lack of galaxies with @xmath29 , due to the finite thickness of spiral disks .",
    "it also shows a dearth of galaxies with @xmath30 , interpreted as an effect of intrinsically triaxial disks .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the bias against edge - on hosts is strongly present in the soft x - ray sample ; the distribution drops off considerably for @xmath31 , similar to what was seen for uv and spectroscopic ( visible ) samples .",
    "we find from a ks test that the soft x - ray sample axial ratios ( table 1 ) are different from those for randomly oriented spirals  the ks probability that the two distributions are consistent is only @xmath32 .",
    "there is also an apparent lack of round galaxies , i.e. galaxies with @xmath33 .",
    "this result persists in progressively more conservative subsamples . in figure",
    "[ fig - hist]b we plot the distribution for a `` more conservative '' sample after removing 12 objects ( table 1 ) whose axial ratios might not be meaningful for disk galaxy statistics because the agn is not in a simple disk galaxy ( flagged by `` m '' ) , suffers from foreground contamination ( flagged by `` f '' ) , or is a strong radio source that could be associated with an elliptical host galaxy ( flagged by `` r '' ) .",
    "the ks probability that the axial ratio distribution for the resulting subsample is consistent with that for randomly oriented disks is @xmath34 .",
    "finally we remove the 18 remaining objects with @xmath26 ( figure [ fig - hist]c ) .",
    "the axial ratio distribution for this `` most conservative '' sample of 44 objects still shows a deficit of highly inclined galaxies , with a ks probability of @xmath35 of being consistent with that for randomly oriented disks .",
    "this result confirms the previous tentative result of mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) that soft x - ray selection suffers a bias against edge - on host galaxies .",
    "we estimate that the soft x - ray sample misses @xmath36 of the agn in galaxies with @xmath37 , corresponding to a missing fraction of @xmath38 over all inclinations .",
    "these statistics apply to only the seyfert 1s  recall from  [ sec - sample ] that seyfert 2 s are not usually detected at all in soft x - ray samples .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath37 corresponds to a galaxy inclination of @xmath39 degrees , which determines the opening half - angle of the obscuring material coplanar with the host galaxy s disk and implies a distribution of material with a thickness approximately equal to its distance from the galaxian center .",
    "the missing fraction implies a large covering factor for the soft x - ray absorber , @xmath40 for @xmath39 degrees .",
    "the soft x - ray regime used to select the agn used in our study allows us to put a stringent lower limit on the column density of obscuring material . for solar abundances and a typical agn intrinsic photon spectrum of @xmath41 ( e.g. petre  1984 ) a column @xmath42",
    "is required to give optical depth @xmath43 over the _ einstein _ bandpass ( harris 1984 ) . a previous hard x - ray study in the 2 - 10 kev band ( lawrence & elvis 1982 ) , which did not detect a bias toward face - on spirals , can be used to set an upper limit on @xmath44 . to give @xmath43 for a typical @xmath45 kev x - ray detector",
    "requires a column density of @xmath46 ( using the mpc response in _ pimms _ , mukai 1993 ) .",
    "hence , the obscuring material has column density in the range @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume a standard milky way ratio of @xmath48 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , we obtain a corresponding visual extinction @xmath49 magnitudes .",
    "the bias against finding edge - on host galaxies seen in this soft x - ray selected agn sample is detected at high confidence .",
    "however , it appears to be weaker than the biases seen in uv and visible samples .",
    "we have quantified the differences among axial ratio distributions of seyferts selected in various wavelength regimes using the ks statistic to test the null hypothesis that two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "hard x - ray selection is represented by the complete , though small , hard x - ray sample described in piccinotti  ( 1982 ) with axial ratios compiled by kotilainen  ( 1992 ) .",
    "soft x - ray selection is represented by the slew survey `` most conservative '' sample in this paper .",
    "uv selection is represented by the cheng ( 1985 ) sample of mostly markarian seyfert 1 s , with the axial ratios taken from zitelli  ( 1993 ) and supplemented by us using values from the literature and dss images .",
    "visible spectroscopic selection is represented by the huchra & burg ( 1992 ) cfa seyfert sample with axial ratios from mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) .",
    "we compare these samples with each other and with the distribution that would be expected from a sample of randomly oriented spirals , and we summarize the results in table [ tab - ks ] and figure [ fig - cum ] .",
    "these tests confirm that only the hard x - ray sample distribution can be consistent with a distribution of randomly oriented disk galaxies , and that all other samples are biased against edge - on galaxies with ks probability @xmath50 .",
    "the ks test can not rule out that the soft x - ray and uv samples might be drawn from the same parent population . however , there are two suggestions that the soft x - ray sample is less biased than the uv sample . first , whereas the soft x - ray distribution might be consistent with the hard x - ray distribution ( ks probability @xmath51 ) , the uv distribution is less likely to be ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "a definitive test awaits a larger hard x - ray sample .",
    "second , the new agn discovered by the slew survey ( shaded area in figure [ fig - hist]a ) tend to have axial ratios in the low @xmath21 half of the distribution , implying that soft x - ray selection has found a fraction of the agn that are missing from uv ( and visible ) surveys .",
    "it is therefore likely that the column density of the absorbing material is close to the lower limit derived above , @xmath42 , or @xmath53 mag , at least for inclinations near 55 degrees .",
    "the obscuring material must lie outside the soft x - ray emitting region of the agn , but this is not a strong constraint . a substantial fraction ( 20 - 30% ) of the soft x - ray emission of some seyfert galaxies",
    "is found to be extended on a kpc scale ( morse  1995 ) .",
    "however , in these galaxies the observed direct soft x - ray continuum has been suppressed by nuclear absorption .",
    "the extended emission is no more than a few percent of the unabsorbed continuum flux , which is compact on sub - pc scales .",
    "mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) have already shown that material with at least several magnitudes of visual extinction and with the same orientation and thickness - to - height ratio hides at least some of the nlr and so must lie at @xmath54 from the agn s center .",
    "it is likely that the x - ray and uv absorbing components are part of a continuous distribution of gas / dust clouds .",
    "in fact , if the column density to the x - ray source is close to our lower limit as suggested above , then most of the soft x - ray absorption can be accounted for by the same , 100 pc - scale material that hides the nlr .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) have suggested that some seyferts of type 1.8 - 1.9 are actually seyfert 1 s viewed through such a thick `` outer torus '' in the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "obtaining high - quality visible spectra for the agn discovered by the slew survey could help us to confirm this trend .",
    "to investigate the question further , though , we will need to find more agn in edge - on galaxies .",
    "hard x - ray selection and infrared selection remain good ways to locate the missing objects .",
    "kirhakos & steiner ( 1990a , b ) combined hard x - ray and far - ir selection to locate new examples of agn in edge - on hosts .",
    "however , if the amount of obscuring material is close to @xmath55 mag as we suggest , then the missing objects should be easily visible even in the near - ir where the extinction is lower by a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , high - quality nuclear spectra in visible light can pick out partially - hidden agn in edge - on galaxies in the nearest galaxies , where the sensitivity to nuclear emission is high because of their proximity ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ; ho 1996 ) .",
    "we note that a related result , namely a bias against edge - on host galaxies , has recently been found by barth  ( 1996 ) for uv - bright liners .",
    "they find that the visibility drops for host inclinations @xmath57 degrees , similar to that found for seyferts .",
    "the good spatial resolution of the images ( from wfpc2 ) shows dust lanes well inside the central kpc of the galaxies with several magnitudes of extinction ( at 2200 ) .",
    "similarly , an hst uv imaging survey of an unbiased sample of 110 nearby galaxies has turned up a tendency for uv `` null emitters '' to appear nearly exclusively in galaxies with inclination @xmath58 degrees , suggesting that the host - galaxy disks obscure what would otherwise be seen as uv `` weak emitters '' ( maoz  1996 ) .",
    "as pointed out in mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) and maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) , direct evidence for a 100 pc - scale , geometrically thick distribution of molecular gas like the one we infer has been seen in several nearby agn ( e.g. tacconi  1994 ; bergman  1992 ; israel  1990 ; rydbeck  1993 ) .",
    "the prevalence of this bias for samples of active and even mildly active nuclei suggests that a geometrically and optically thick distribution of gas and dust could be a common feature of the early - type disk galaxies in which they are generally found",
    ". the obscuring material would be more difficult to detect in galaxies where there is no bright , compact nucleus , especially given the required spatial resolution : @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "a high - resolution co aperture synthesis study of the nearby , edge - on spiral ngc891 shows evidence for a relatively thick nuclear disk of molecular gas with @xmath61 in a normal galaxy ( scoville  1993 ) .",
    "the disk has thickness @xmath62 , within a factor of 1.5 as geometrically thick as we infer from the agn axial ratios , and contains enough material to satisfy the optical depth requirement .",
    "there is so far no evidence that this molecular disk has a central hole to provide the required opening angle .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) speculate that , for seyferts , a distribution of obscuring material with a central hole might result from the tidal disruption of molecular clouds as they migrate inwards from the large - scale galaxy disk into the potential of the compact central object . here",
    "we suggest a complementary model that naturally accounts for a central hole , namely that the gas is part of a nuclear ring of the type often associated with bars or oval distortions in early - type spirals .",
    "nuclear star - forming rings have sizes on the order of several hundred pc and are probably associated with the inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) of the potential ( buta & crocker 1993 ; kenney 1996 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of barred galaxies show that the buildup of central mass results in the formation of a strong ilr .",
    "the gas transported inwards via radial orbits in the large - scale bar or oval distortion collects at the ilr , and even the cold gas there can have a geometrically thick distribution because of vertical resonances ( friedli & benz 1993 ) .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then we would expect the large scale galaxy disks to show evidence of the nonaxisymmetric potential .",
    "indeed , the axial ratio distribution for the slew survey sample shows a strong deficit of galaxies with @xmath33 indicating a lack of round galaxies ( figure [ fig - hist ] ) .",
    "similar deficits were noted by malkan , margon , & chanan ( 1984 ) for their soft x - ray sample , and by maiolino & rieke for their spectroscopic sample .",
    "the uv - excess sample in figure [ fig - cum ] shows a similar but weaker bias . because @xmath21 can not exceed unity",
    ", the effect of measurement uncertainties will tend to create a deficit in the last bin , but this effect should be relatively small given the accuracy of our measurements .",
    "however , the distributions for normal spiral galaxies also show a bias against perfectly round systems ( figure [ fig - hist]d ; binney & devaucouleurs 1981 ; fasano  1993 ) , and it is likely that disks of non - active galaxies are triaxial ( binney & devaucouleurs 1981 ; fasano  1993 ; rix & zaritsky 1995 )",
    ". we can not determine from our data whether the seyfert hosts are less often perfectly round than those of nonactive spirals , but the observed distribution suggests that this might be an interesting topic for future study .",
    "we have defined a complete sample of _ einstein _ slew survey agn with @xmath0 .",
    "this sample comprises 96 mostly type 1 agn including 19 objects at @xmath63 not previously known to be active .",
    "the distribution of host - galaxy axial ratios clearly shows a bias toward face - on spirals , confirming the existence of a geometrically thick layer of obscuring material in the host - galaxy planes . combining this and other studies ,",
    "we infer that this material is likely to be @xmath64 pc from the nucleus with a thickness of @xmath64 pc and column density of @xmath65 , probably nearer the low end of this range for lines of sight near the edge of the @xmath66 degree opening half - angle .",
    "the covering fraction of the soft x - ray absorbing material within this thick distribution is large , about 60% .",
    "soft x - ray selection appears to recover some of the edge - on objects missed in uv and visible surveys but still results in an overall 30% incompleteness for type 1 s .",
    "we speculate that thick rings of obscuring material like the ones we infer for seyferts might be commonly present in early type spirals , sitting at the inner lindblad resonances of the nonaxisymmetric potentials of the host galaxies .",
