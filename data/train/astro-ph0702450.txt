    "in our previous paper @xcite the points mentioned in the abstract were outlined only briefly , using order - of - magnitude arguments and with very little explanation , due to space limitations . here",
    "we present a more detailed explanation and analysis of the prompt thermal x - ray emission and x - ray afterglow , as well as a calculation of the early optical - uv emission , and show that some claims made in recent publications @xcite , according to which the observations are inconsistent with the massive wind interpretation , are not valid .",
    "grb060218 was unique mainly in two respects : it showed a strong thermal x - ray emission accompanying the prompt non - thermal emission , and a strong optical - uv emission at early , @xmath0  d , time .",
    "we show here that these features , as well as the x - ray afterglow , can all be explained by a model in which a radiation mediated shock propagates through a compact progenitor star into a massive wind .",
    "we have shown in a separate paper @xcite that the prompt non - thermal x - ray emission can also be explained by this model .    as detailed below , the prompt thermal x - ray emission",
    "can be explained as shock breakout at a radius of @xmath4  cm , which requires a thomson optical depth ( of the plasma ahead of the shock ) of @xmath5 .",
    "breakout may occur at @xmath4  cm if this is the stellar progenitor radius .",
    "however , since the progenitor is likely to be smaller , we suggested the possibility of it being surrounded by an optically thick wind .",
    "another possibility is a pre - explosion ejection of a small mass , @xmath6 , shell .",
    "here we shall adopt the wind interpretation , since it allows one to explain also the x - ray afterglow .",
    "so far , no other quantitative physical models have been worked out for the thermal x - ray emission , nor for the x - ray afterglow . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the afterglow x - ray emission is due to extended activity of the source , for which there is no model or explanation .",
    "@xcite suggest , for explaining the x - ray afterglow , an ansatz consisting of the ad - hoc existence of electrons with some prescribed energy distribution , which is different at different times to account for the observations , without a model for the dynamics of the plasma or for the electron energy distribution .",
    "we note that the radio afterglow of grb060218 discussed by @xcite is difficult to explain within the context of the current model . indeed , as pointed out by @xcite and by @xcite",
    ", it is difficult to explain the radio afterglow and the x - ray afterglow of grb060218 as due to emission from a single shock wave .",
    "these authors have thus chosen to construct models that account for the radio emission only , attributing the x - ray afterglow to a continued activity of the source of an unexplained nature , and not accounting for the prompt x - ray emission and for the early optical - uv emission .",
    "we adopt a different approach , showing that the prompt ( thermal and non - thermal ) x - ray emission , the early optical - uv emission , and the late x - ray afterglow can all be explained within the context of the same model .",
    "we argue that it is the radio afterglow , rather than all the other components , which remains unexplained , and which should be attributed to a different component . since the radio emission carries only a negligible fraction of the energy , and given the large anisotropy of the explosion , it is not difficult to imagine the existence of such an additional low energy component .    in ",

    "this is only an approximate estimate , and the total thermal energy may be somewhat larger , due to the gap in xrt observations between @xmath7  s and @xmath12  s. we consider here a model where this radiation is due to a  shock breakout \" .    .",

    "* for review ) .",
    "the energy density behind the shock is dominated by radiation , and the mechanism that converts kinetic energy to thermal energy at the shock transition is compton scattering .",
    "the optical depth of the shock transition layer is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the shock velocity .",
    "this thickness is determined by the requirement that the time it takes a fluid element to flow through the transition layer , @xmath19 , should be comparable to the diffusion time of photons across this layer , @xmath20 . as the shock propagates outward , the ( thomson ) optical depth of the plasma lying ahead of the shock decreases , and when this optical depth becomes comparable to @xmath21 , compton scattering",
    "can no longer maintain the shock .",
    "at this point , radiation escapes ahead of the shock , producing the shock breakout flash @xcite , and the shock becomes collisional ( or collisionless , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hereafter we use the term `` shock breakout '' to denote the event of the transition from radiation to collisional ( collisionless ) shock mediation , accompanied by the emission of radiation .",
    "if the optical depth of the wind surrounding the progenitor star is small , shock breakout will take place as the shock approaches the stellar surface .",
    "it is for this reason customary to identify shock breakout with the emergence of the shock from the stellar surface .",
    "however , if the optical depth of the wind is large , @xmath22 , breakout would occur once the shock reaches a radius where the wind optical depth drops to @xmath21 .    as argued in @xcite , in order to obtain a breakout flash with energy of @xmath23  erg and temperature @xmath8  kev , breakout must occur at a radius of @xmath24  cm , and the shock must be mildly relativistic ( which implies @xmath25 ) . since the progenitor star is presumably smaller than this ( e.g. if it is a wolf - rayet star ) , a value of @xmath26 at @xmath24  cm may be obtained either by assuming that the progenitor is surrounded by a dense wind , or that an outer shell of the star was ejected to this radius prior to the grb explosion .",

    "the calculation below we adopt a density profile @xmath29 , as would be expected for the wind model .",
    "the results obtained for the breakout radius , shock velocity and plasma density at this radius are not sensitive , however , to the details of the density profile shape .",
    "we consider therefore a shock wave of velocity @xmath30 driven into the wind surrounding the progenitor , whose 4-velocity is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor .",
    "let us first derive the energy and temperature of the post - shock radiation .",
    "the post - shock temperature @xmath33 is related to the post - shock pressure by @xmath34 , and the observed temperature is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the post - shock plasma velocity ( @xmath38 ) . for a strong radiation dominated shock @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the pre - shock density and @xmath41 is a factor of order unity .",
    "as we show below , the shock is required to be mildly relativistic , @xmath42  a few , for which we may approximate @xmath43 ( for @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "this defines the observed temperature , @xmath48 , to be @xmath49 ( for @xmath44 , the numerical coefficient is @xmath50 instead of 1 ) .",
    "the energy carried by the radiation may be estimated by noting that the energy density of the radiation is given , in the observer frame , by @xmath51 , and that the thickness of the shocked plasma shell may be approximated as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the shock radius .",
    "this yields @xmath54 ( for @xmath44 , the numerical coefficient is @xmath55 instead of 0.5 ) .    for a wind density profile ,",
    "the optical depth of the wind at radius @xmath53 is simply @xmath56 . expressing the density in terms of @xmath57 and using eqs .",

    "( [ eq : u ] ) and  ( [ eq : r ] ) imply that the breakout of the shock takes place at a radius @xmath64  cm , and that the shock is mildly relativistic at breakout , @xmath65 i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the order of magnitude estimates given in @xcite . since the shock is found to be mildly relativistic , using @xmath61 at shock breakout is justified . in order to produce the shock that is driven into the wind , the explosion is thus required to produce a mildly relativistic shell , @xmath67 , with an energy of a few  @xmath2  erg .",
    "this is remarkably similar to the case of grb980425/sn1998bw , for which the ejection of a shell of energy @xmath68  erg and velocity @xmath67 was inferred from x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite observations .",
    "the wind density at the breakout radius , @xmath69 , is also in agreement with our results in @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the energy density is dominated by radiation , @xmath70 . for a wind velocity of @xmath71",
    "it corresponds to a mass loss rate of few  @xmath72 .",
    "the relevant mass loss here is that occurring within a day or less of the explosion .",
    "the data currently available on wind mass losses suggesting @xmath73 refer to much longer timescales , for stars well before any explosion @xcite .",
    "physically , it is however quite plausible that the mass loss increases considerably as the evolution of the core rapidly approaches the final collapse , accompanied by a rapid increase in the luminosity and the envelope expansion rate .",
    "note that if both the shell and the wind were spherically symmetric , the characteristic timescale would be @xmath74  s ( for the inferred post shock velocity , @xmath75 , the effects of relativistic beaming are not significant ) , while the observed timescale of the thermal x - ray emission is @xmath76  s @xcite . however , an anisotropic shell ejection is a natural expectation in a core collapse grb , since strong rotation is a requisite to make the jet ( e.g. @xcite ) . even ",
    "normal \" core collapse sn simulations show strong rotation - related anisotropy in the expanding gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the semi - relativistic outer shell ejected is likely to be anisotropic , either due to an anisotropic explosion , or due to being driven by a jet .",
    "this , as well as an anisotropic wind profile caused by rotation @xcite should lead to significant departures from sphericity in the shock propagation .",
    "anisotropy is in fact a prediction of this model , which is supported by the detection of linear polarization @xcite . in an anisotropic shock , however , the timescale is no longer the naive spherical @xmath77 value , but is rather given by the sideways pattern expansion timescale , which depends on the angular velocity profile of the anisotropic shell ( e.g. at larger angles the shock emerges later due a decreasing velocity profile or due to an increasing wind density away from the symmetry axis , etc . ) .",
    "if the wind shock breakout interpretation is adopted , the subsequent interaction of the ejected relativistic shell with the wind is expected to produce an x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "the electrons accelerated to high energy in the collisionless shock driven into the wind emit x - ray synchrotron radiation , and may also inverse - compton scatter optical - uv sn photons to the x - ray band .",
    "as the shock wave driven into the wind expands , it heats an increasing amount of mass to a high temperature and the initial energy of the ejected shell is transferred to the shocked wind .",
    "the shell begins to decelerate beyond a radius at which the shocked wind energy becomes comparable to the initial shell energy .",
    "this occurs at a time @xcite @xmath78 here , @xmath79  erg is the kinetic energy of the shell and @xmath80 for the wind density and shell velocity inferred in   [ sec : breakout ] , @xmath66 and @xmath81 , @xmath82  s. at @xmath83 the energy is carried by shocked wind plasma , and is continuously transferred to a larger mass of newly shocked parts of the wind .",
    "thus , the rate at which energy is transferred to accelerated electrons is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the fraction of the post - shock thermal energy carried by electrons .",
    "if the electrons cool on a time scale shorter than the expansion time , @xmath86 , this would lead to a bolometric luminosity @xmath87 .",
    "the fraction of this luminosity emitted as x - rays depends on the electron energy distribution . for electrons accelerated to a power - law distribution in energy , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the maximum and minimum electron lorentz factor .",

    "it is the photospheric radius which needs to be large in order to allow sufficiently large shock breakout energy .",
    "@xmath214 is larger than @xmath211 by a factor of 210 , depending on the model adopted for the wind velocity profile .",
    "nugis & lamers 2002 present late type models with @xmath222 , and a large fraction of the stars analyzed in hamann & koesterke ( 1998 ) have @xmath223 ( see their table 2 ) .",
    "@xmath214 larger than @xmath210 may therefore be obtained for stars with large mass loss rates .    it should be emphasized that even if the wind photospheric radius required for grb 060218 had turned out to be larger by a factor of a few than the largest @xmath214 of known wr stars , this would not have been a strong argument against the wind interpretation of grb 060218 , since grb progenitors may well be more extreme than normal wr stars .",
    "clearly , not all wr stars end their lives as grbs .",
    "moreover , it should be remembered that practically nothing is known about the mass loss on a day time scale prior to the explosion , which determines the wind density at the relevant radii .",
    "@xcite raised different criticisms in different versions of their paper . in the first version , astro - ph/0604016v1",
    ", they argued that the presence of a massive wind would result in strong optical emission at early time , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "while this claim was retracted in subsequent versions of their manuscript , it may be worthwhile to clarify this issue here .",
    "the synchrotron emission given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : synch ] ) holds for frequencies above the cooling frequency , @xmath224 .",
    "since the cooling frequency is low for a massive wind , see equation ( [ eq : nu_c ] ) , we expect in this model a similar x - ray and optical - uv luminosity , @xmath225 ( corresponding to a flux of @xmath226 in the @xmath227 band of swift s uvot ) .",
    "this predicted flux exceeds the observed flux at @xmath228  s , hence the statement of @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in   [ sec : wind - shell ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : synch ] ) holds only for times @xmath229  s ( and the luminosity is lower at earlier times ) .",
    "moreover , at @xmath228  s the large x - ray luminosity , @xmath230 , would suppress the synchrotron emission of the shock accelerated electrons . as explained in ",
    "[ sec : wind - shell ] , the cooling time of shock accelerated electrons due to synchrotron emission is short compared to the shock expansion time . at early times , @xmath228  s , the ratio of the magnetic energy density , @xmath231 , to the x - ray energy density , @xmath232 , is @xmath233 , which implies that the ic cooling time is much shorter than the synchrotron cooling time , suppressing the synchrotron emission in the optical band .",
    "second , @xcite argue ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that radio observations rule out the existence of a massive wind .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , indeed the radio and the x - ray afterglow are difficult to explain in the framework of a single shock .",
    "however , the radio observations alone can not be used to rule out the existence of a massive wind , since radio observations do not allow one to determine the explosion parameters .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that estimates for the kinetic energy based on modeling the radio data alone range from @xmath234  erg to @xmath235  erg , and that the ambient medium density estimates range from @xmath236 to @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite argue that in the presence of a massive wind , the radio flux would be higher than observed . as explained in   [ sec : radio ] , our problem is quite the opposite : our model flux would be too low to account for the observed radio emission . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have chosen to construct models of grb060218 which concentrate on accounting for the radio emission , while attributing the x - ray afterglow to a continued activity of the source of an unexplained nature , and de - emphasizing the importance of prompt x - ray emission and the early optical - uv emission .",
    "however , the radio emission represents a negligible fraction of the total energy . here , and in @xcite",
    ", we have adopted a different approach , which is that the prompt ( thermal and non - thermal ) x - ray emission , the early optical - uv emission , and the late x - ray afterglow can all be explained within the context of the same model , which is based on the energetics of the early phases of the explosion .",
    "we argue that it is the radio afterglow , rather than all the other components , which plays a lesser role , and which may be attributed to a different component .",
    "given the very low energy of the radio emission and the the large anisotropy expected in the explosion , such an additional low energy radio component is imaginable , whose role is unlikely to be important in determining the characteristics of the early high energy emission .",
    "we have discussed a comprehensive model of the early x - ray and optical / uv behavior of the grb060218/sn2006aj system , which provides the quantitative justification for the interpretation outlined in @xcite , as well as a number of additional points .",
    "the most exciting features of this event were that it showed a strong thermal x - ray component as well as a strong optical / uv component in its early phases , at @xmath0 day , transitioning later to a more conventional x - ray and optical afterglow , and a radio afterglow .",
    "we have shown that the early x - ray / o / uv behavior can be understood in terms of a mildly relativistic radiation - mediated shock which breaks out of a ( thomson ) optically thick wind produced by the progenitor star , leading to the observed thermal x - rays ( see   [ sec : breakout ] ) .",
    "the early optical / uv behavior arises as the shocked stellar envelope expands to larger radii (   [ sec : uv ] ) , and the x - ray afterglow arises from synchrotron and inverse - compton emission of electrons accelerated by the propagation of the shock further into the wind (   [ sec : wind - shell ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the optical - uv emission may therefore provide stringent constraints on the progenitor star .",
    "the thermal x - ray emission requires a mildly relativistic shock , @xmath238 , carrying @xmath239  erg , driven into a massive wind characterized by a mass loss rate of a few  @xmath240 for a wind velocity of @xmath241 .",
    "the later x - ray afterglow is consistent with emission due to the propagation of this shock into the wind beyond the breakout radius , where the shock becomes collisionless .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of grb980425/sn1998bw , for which the x - ray and radio afterglow are interpreted as emission from a shock driven into a ( much less massive ) wind by the ejection of a shell of energy @xmath68  erg and velocity @xmath67 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the early optical - uv emission is consistent with the expansion of the outer part , @xmath3 , of the stellar envelope , which was heated to a high temperature by the radiation dominated shock as it accelerates in its propagation towards the stellar edge .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the acceleration of the shock near the stellar surface is not sufficient to account for the large energy , @xmath239  erg , deposited in the mildly relativistic , @xmath238 , component , which is required to have a mass of @xmath242 .",
    "for the parameters inferred from the sn2006aj light curve , @xmath243  erg and @xmath244 @xcite , the energy predicted to by carried by @xmath245 is less than @xmath246  erg ( see fig .",
    "6 of * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the mildly relativistic component is driven not ( only ) by the spherical sn shock propagating through the envelope , but possibly by a more relativistic component of the the explosion , e.g. a relativistic jet propagating through the star .",
    "an important factor in our interpretation of the early x - ray emission is the anisotropy of this shock , which leads to a characteristic timescale of the thermal x - ray emission controlled by the sideways pattern expansion speed , rather than by a simple radial line of sight velocity .",
    "a significant anisotropy of the mildly relativistic shock component is expected for various reasons , e.g. as a result of being driven by a jet , or due to propagation through an anisotropic envelope and into an anisotropic wind caused by fast progenitor rotation , etc .",
    "the simplest explanation for the prompt gamma - ray behavior may be that it is due to a relativistic jet , which can contribute to the anisotropy of the mildly relativistic shock propagating through the stellar envelope and the mildly relativistic ejected shell . in this case , the contribution of the relativistic jet to the late ( @xmath247 day ) x - ray and optical afterglow is not the dominant effect ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a possible explanation of the prompt non - thermal emission , both in grb980425 and grb060218 , may be that it is due to repeated ic scattering at breakout , as suggested in @xcite ( c.f .",
    "in this case there may be no highly relativistic jet- it may either be mildly relativistic to begin with , or it may have been relativistic but it was choked , only its mildly relativistic bow shock emerging from the star .    if our interpretation is correct , the importance of the early thermal x - ray component is that it represents the first detection ever of the breakout of a supernova shock from the effective photosphere of the progenitor star . since this is a grb - related supernova ,",
    "a strong stellar wind can be expected , which results in the breakout photospheric radius being in the wind , rather than in the outer atmosphere of the star .",
    "this provides a potentially valuable tool for investigating the physical conditions , mass loss and composition of the long grb progenitors in the last few days and hours of their evolution prior to their core collapse ."
